  [Text] Panmunjom, March 19 (KCNA) -- The eighth working 
contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between the 
North and the South was held in the South side's portion of 
Panmunjom today. 
  The head of the North side made a keynote speech first at 
the 
contact. 
  He said the whole course of discussions and working contact 
between the North and the South in the past ten months since the 
North side proposed the exchange of special envoys leads us to a 
conclusion distinguishing between unity and confrontation, 
between national independence and dependence on outside forces, 
and between patriotism and treachery which are incompatible with 
each other. 
  Clarifying the North side's stand toward the working 
contact, 
he said: 
  "Firstly, our side, considering that the four-point demand 
we 
have raised in keeping with the prevailing situation are 
entirely just, insist on it again. 
  "Executing a swift volte-face, the South side is now crying 
for a `tough reaction' against its dialogue partner. It is 
openly blaring that the `Team Spirit' joint military exercises 
must be resumed, the plan to introduce Patriot missiles be 
reexamined and international `sanctions' be taken against the 
North. 
  "This is, indeed, an act that scuttles the working contact 
for the exchange of special envoys and brings the situation of 
Korea to a touch-and-go phase. 
  "We strongly demand that the South side bear responsibility 
for the obstacles it has laid intentionally to the working 
contact and make clear its attitude toward our side's just 
four-point demand at today's contact. 
  "Secondly, we cannot but take a serious view of the fact 
that 
the South side has tried to use the exchange of special envoys 
for other political purposes, taking a dishonest attitude toward 
the working contact." 
  He strongly urged the South side to apologize to the nation, 
frankly admitting that it has abused the working-level contact 
to hinder the DPRK-U.S. talks, fully revealing its dark 
intention. 
  "Thirdly," he said, "we cannot but take a serious view of 
the 
fact that the South side is bringing the North-South relations 
to the phase of an unpredictable confrontation by trying to 
hinder the DPRK-U.S. talks and make the exchange of special 
envoys abortive." 
  He stated: 
  "We will never look with folded arms at anybody trying to 
ignite a war on the Korean peninsula. 
  "As we have already declared, we are fully prepared to 
answer 
dialogue with dialogue, and war with war. 
  "We makes it unequivocal to your side that we do not like 
empty talk and will take every necessary countermeasure." 
[sentence as received] 
  At the contact today, the South side repeated its 
unreasonable argument, far from showing a positive attitude 
toward the North side's just demand and position. 
  The North side urged the South side not to utter unnecessary 
words but to give an answer to the North side's position and 
clarify whether it would accept the North-proposed exchange of 
special envoys or refuse it. 
  The North side sternly said that the South side was free to 
part with the North, if it wished to. 
  Noting that the South side at a "high-level strategic 
meeting" the day before yesterday adopted a "policy of tough 
reaction" toward the North and said it would resume the Team 
Spirit exercises, promote the plan of Patriot missile 
introduction and join in "sanctions" against the North, the 
North side said, "is this not a declaration of refusal of the 
exchange of special envoys, a declaration of all-out 
confrontation and war with the North." 
  Upset by this, the South side brought forward an "emergency 
proposal" urging the North side to stop slandering the chief 
executive of the South side and refrain from inciting the 
anti-"government" struggle of the South Korean people and 
exchange special envoys primarily for the solution of the 
nuclear issue. 
  The North side turned it down, saying that the working-level 
contact was not a place for making such argument. 
  Noting that the exchange of special envoys had already been 
scuttled by the South side, he pointed out that the recent 
"high-level strategic meeting" was aimed at foiling it. 
  "So, the South side must be held wholly responsible for 
bringing the exchange of special envoys to a head," he added. 
  The chief delegate of the South side, much upset, said if 
the 
exchange of special envoys were scuttled and the working contact 
broken up, the danger to be entailed by it is unpredictable. 
  The head of the North side told him: "Never mind. We are 
prepared for anything. As I already declared in my keynote 
speech, we are prepared both for dialogue and war. If any 
forces took "sanctions" against and provoked us, we will 
promptly take a decisive self-defensive measure. We mean what 
we say." 
  The South side did not utter a word in answer. 
  Since the South side failed to answer our proposal, our 
side said today's contact should be closed. 
  Closing the contact, the North side said it would come to 
the 
next contact if the South side notified it of the date with the 
willingness to accept our proposal.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the North side's delegation of the </F>
working-level delegates' contact for the exchange of top-level 
special envoys of the North and South on 21 March -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] In connection with the fact that the exchange of 
special envoys is faced with a grave crisis [omjunghan wigi] 
because of the unreasonable maneuvers of the South Korean 
authorities, the North side's delegation of the working-level 
delegates' contact for the exchange of top-level special envoys 
of the North and South issued the following statement: 
  Statement issued by the North side's delegation of the 
working- level delegates contact for the exchange of top-level 
special envoys of the North and South: 
  With the rupture [kyollyol] of the working-level delegates 
contacts which were being held between the North and South, the 
exchange of top-level special envoys is currently faced with a 
very grave crisis. 
  As already known, working-level delegates contacts were held 
on eight occasions between the two sides from May of last year, 
when our side for the first time initiated the exchange of 
top-level special envoys of the North and South, up till the 
present. 
  During the whole process of the working-level delegates 
contact for the exchange of top-level special envoys of the 
North and South, the North and South showed fundamental 
differences in positions. While the North was of the position of 
national independence, peace, reunification, and patriotism, the 
South was of the position of depending on outside forces, war, 
division, and nation-selling. 
  As the party concerned that directly initiated the exchange 
of special envoys, our side from the first exerted all sincerity 
and efforts so that the special envoys of the North and South 
can quickly exchange visits between Pyongyang and Seoul. From 
the level of the special envoys, their duties, to the procedures 
of the exchange, we put forth reasonable proposals, and showed 
the sincerity of holding working-level delegates contacts with 
the South side from a sincere attitude for its early settlement . 
  In the contacts, our side sometimes showed tolerance 
[aryang] 
from a broad-minded position of making concessions to the South 
side regarding the level of the special envoys, and when the 
South side showed a negative attitude in holding dialogue by 
following the outside forces, our side progressed the contacts 
with tolerance by giving necessary explanations and advice to 
the South side from the position of realizing the exchange of 
special envoys in whatever way. 
  Nevertheless, the South side assumed a fundamentally 
contrary 
attitude with us. At first, without any reasonable reason, they 
not only from the beginning rejected even to accept our proposal 
for the exchange of special envoys, but they also dragged this 
issue on for as many as five months and rejected the 
working-level delegates contact itself. Also even after coming 
forth to the contact because of the pressure of the public 
opinion at home and abroad, they repeatedly created artificial 
barriers and obstacles before the contact, thus interrupting 
[panghae] the realization of the exchange of special envoys. 
  While sitting face to face with us--the fellow 
countrymen--to 
hold dialogue, the South side begged to the outside forces for 
the establishment of an international cooperative system and 
asked to put pressure and sanctions against the fellow 
countrymen. Also, they have been assuming a very insidious 
attitude of intentionally aggravating a tense situation, and 
provoking an absurd warmonger's remark to the other side of 
dialogue by saying that they will be ready even for military 
confrontation. 
  The South side even committed reckless acts which threatens 
the other side of dialogue by enforcing various provocative 
military exercises including the Team Spirit nuclear war 
exercise which cannot be compatible with dialogue and the 
exchange of special envoys, and promoting the plan to bring in 
the Patriot missiles. 
  In particular, what cannot be overlooked is the fact that 
the 
South Korean ruling bunch repeatedly carried out insidious 
maneuvers of abusing the working-level delegates contact for the 
exchange of special envoys of the North and South to obstruct 
and put the brakes on the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The DPRK-U.S. talks and the exchange of special envoys of 
the 
North and South are originally different issues. The fact that 
the South Korean ruling bunch is abusing the issue of the 
exchange of special envoys to obstruct the DPRK-U.S. talks 
itself is a nation- selling and antinational act. 
  When the South Korean authorities regarded the fellow 
countrymen with hostility, carried out wicked rash acts to plot 
to harm us with the outside forces, and even suspended the 
working-level delegates contact, we did not abandon our will to 
exchange the special envoys but tolerantly urged for dialogue 
and negotiations and dealt with the working-level delegates 
contact with sincerity. 
  Our side's active will and efforts regarding the exchange of 
special envoys was all the more clearly revealed during the 
talks held on five occasions since 3 March, when the 
working-level delegates contact for the exchange of special 
envoys was resumed. 
  As an expression of tolerance and sincerity toward the other 
side of dialogue, our side showed a constructive negotiating 
attitude by making new epoch-making measures and repeatedly 
making proposals for revisions on the issue of discussing 
procedures, so that a situation in which the working-level 
delegates contact, which was resumed after a long time, will not 
be suspended or ruptured again. 
  At the sixth working-level delegates contact, our side took 
a 
broad-minded position regarding the four-point demand which was 
justly proposed to the South side to suspend all large-scale 
nuclear war exercises which oppose the other side of dialogue; 
give up the international cooperation system; cancel the plan to 
bring in Patriot missiles; and cancel the remark that we cannot 
shake hands with the counterpart that possesses nuclear weapons. 
Our side also made a proposal to remove apprehensions to the 
whole nation on the exchange of special envoys by issuing a 
joint communique that the two sides reconfirmed the will for the 
exchange of special envoys and agreed to realize it as soon as 
possible. This is a clear example of our side's active attitude 
in the talks. 
  In reality, our side's such sincere position became an 
epoch- 
making opportunity in untying the knot between the North and 
South at once and in opening a firm prospect for the exchange of 
special envoys. 
  However, even this time the South side not only took an 
attitude of opposing our side's constructive proposal without 
giving any reason [toponokko], but also perpetrated the 
extremely haughty against us at a so-called high-level strategic 
meeting of ministers concerned and of clamoring at the meeting 
about resuming the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise, promoting 
the plan to introduce Patriot missiles and international 
sanctions while babbling outside the contact that the exchange 
of special envoys is a precondition for the third round of the 
DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  Such a sudden [kapchaksuroun] provocative act by the South 
Korean ruling bunch is in fact a declaration of renouncing the 
exchange of special envoys after the declaration of the breakup 
of the working-level delegates contact and a declaration of 
overall confrontation with us. [namjoson tongchibaedului i 
kapchaksuroun tobalhaengwinun sasilsange issoso silmudaepyo 
chopchok pakoe sonon ihu toksagyohwan pogi sonon imyo uriedaehan 
chonmyonjok taegyol sononida.] 
  In this way, at a time when the third round of the DPRK-U.S. 
talks are only five to six days away, the South Korean ruling 
bunches irritated the other side of dialogue and unilaterally 
declared the breakup of the North-South working-level delegates 
contact. Thus, they committed the intolerable criminal act of 
going so far as to deliberately put the brakes on the DPRK-U.S. 
talks. 
  We strongly condemn the South Korean authorities for having 
revealed the dark intent to part [kyolbyol] from us by 
consistently utilizing the exchange of special envoys for 
insidious political purposes and eventually breaking the 
North-South working-level delegates contact. 
  The South Korean authorities should know that they can never 
escape the responsibility for breaking the working-level 
delegates contact for the exchange of special envoys. 
  The developments in South Korea today show that the Kim 
Yong-sam ring, although it is clamoring about a civilian 
government, has deteriorated North-South relations more than the 
previous military dictators and is leading the situation to an 
aspect [kugmuyon] of confrontation and war. 
  There is no other treatment [taejop] for those who clamor 
about a civilian government in words but run wild with knife in 
deeds. Crime is destined to go to those who commit it. There 
will be only the nation's curse and ruin for those who do not 
know how to defend independence, the life of the nation, who 
inspire antagonism and confrontation within the nation by 
following outside forces, and who lead the situation to the 
aspect of war. 
  The people of all strata, youth, and students in South Korea 
will never tolerate the antinational act the South Korean 
authorities took this time in the entire course of North-South 
working-level delegates contact for the exchange of special 
envoys. They should know that there have been no dictators in 
South Korea who could survive committing the antinational act of 
betraying fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces and 
that these flunkyist, nation-sellers met bitter doom. 
  Our North side's delegation will, in the future, pay 
attention to the South side's chief delegate's remarks that it 
will not hold contact any longer. 
  [Dated] 21 March 1994, Pyongyang

  [Text] Police have mounted a manhunt for at least two 
people believed responsible for the homemade bomb found 
accidentally by Lumphini police on Thursday after it was 
concluded they may belong to the same gang which planted a bomb 
in the World Trade Center in New York early last year. 
  Senior Metropolitan Police officers and representatives of 
the National Security Council and National Intelligence Agency 
arrived at the possible World Trade Center link after a two-hour 
meeting. 
  The high-level meeting was called after a team of 
Metropolitan Police searched a shophouse in Bang Kapi where they 
found another steel water tank, 25 sacks of fertilizer, 
electrical wiring and 50 other items believed used in assembling 
the bomb. 
  Police said the investigators were led to the three-story 
shophouse by a water tank shop on Ramkhamhaeng Road whose 
address was on the side of the bomb found on board a rented 
truck in front of the Lumphini Police Station on Thursday. 
  The station police had taken the truck from Chitlom Road 
near 
the Israel Embassy where it was left by a "Mideast-looking" 
driver after it hit a motorcycle on coming out of the Central 
Department Store parking lot on March 11. 
  The bomb was found when the truck owner, turning up to claim 
the vehicle, became suspicious of the water tank and a strong 
stench and asked the police to investigate. The smell was found 
to come from a body inside the tank. 
  Police found the tank was filled with ammonium nitrate, 
diesel fuel, six bars of C-4 plastic explosive wired to a 
battery aboard the truck, and the body, found later to be that 
of the driver assigned to deliver the vehicle to a 
Mideast-looking man at Makro superstore in Bang Kapi on March 10. 
  Police said they questioned staff at the water tank shop who 
confirmed they had delivered two tanks to a house on Sukhaphiban 
Road at the order of a foreign buyer. 
  Police said they found a receipt which showed the fertilizer 
had been ordered from a shop in Thon Buri. 
  The shop had been rented to a Mideast-looking man who spoke 
Thai about four months ago, police said. 
  Metropolitan Police Commissioner Chaiyasit Kanchanakit said 
investigators have identified of the Mideast-looking man who 
drove the truck and rented the shophouse. 
  He said the man had rented the house since August last year 
and had transferred money to the house owner to pay for the rent 
from a province in the South. 
  Interpol has already been contacted to look for the man who 
might have left the country, he said. 
  Up to four foreigners lived in the house, he said, but the 
landlord believed they had now left Thailand. 
  Pol. [Police] Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said, based on the contents 
and materials used to make the bomb and the items found 
yesterday at the house, police and intelligence agencies decided 
the terrorists belonged to the same group which exploded a bomb 
at the World Trade Center in New York. 
  The bomb used at the World Trade Center on February 26 last 
year was said to be made of the same concoction known among U.S. 
Federation Bureau of Investigation agents as a "witches' brew". 
  Police on Thursday said the homemade bomb found on the 
truck, 
using the mixture of fertilizer and diesel fuel to add to its 
explosive strength, was big enough to destroy a large building. 
  Pol. Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said investigation teams had been 
assigned to watch out for foreigners who look like the person in 
the sketch drawn up from witnesses' accounts. 
  "The problem is we are not sure if they are still in 
Thailand," said Pol. Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit, who on Thursday said he 
was "50 percent" sure the terrorists are still in the Kingdom. 
  The officer said he was confident the terrorists were 
foreigners who had chosen the Israel Embassy as their target 
because the truck carrying the bomb was heading toward the 
embassy on Soi Lang Suan when it was involved in an accident 
with a motorcycle. 
  He said the information given by the owner of the truck, the 
water tank shop staff and the motorcyclist indicates the 
Mideast- looking who rented the truck and bought the water tanks 
was the same person. 
  The man communicated with his hands and spoke both English 
and Arabic. 
  Pol. Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said he was confident there was more 
than one, probably three to four, people involved in the plot 
and they would have had to have been in the country for some 
time because the person who drove the truck appeared to know 
Bangkok's roads. 
  Police Director-General Pratin Santipraphop said he believed 
at least two Mideast-looking men were involved in an 
international plot to blow up the Israeli Embassy. 
  But the names of the two suspects art still unknown and it 
is 
not sure if they are still in Thailand, he said. 
  Pol. Gen. Pratin. said police yesterday searched several 
areas of Bang Mot and Ramkhamhaeng in search of the suspects. 
  He said he had not appointed a special police team to work 
on 
the case but admitted to working closely with officials from the 
Israeli Embassy. 
  Metropolitan Police Assistant Director-General Bunchop 
Phumwichit said plainclothes police had been sent to various 
hotels, hangouts of Mideast visitors, Makro superstore in Bang 
Kapi, the water tank shop and the Central Department Store 
parking lot to gather more information. 
  Immigration police have been instructed to step up 
surveillance at border checkpoints. 
  The Israeli Embassy has sent a message to thank the police 
for the increased security following the discovery of the bomb, 
he said. 
  Extra security has been ordered for foreign embassies, 
particularly the Israeli Embassy, since Thursday night. 
  A Syrian tourist, Mohammad Hazamail, 35, was detained at his 
rented room at Phetchaburi Apartment yesterday by Immigration 
police and taken immediately to Lumphini police station for 
questioning and identification by the motorcyclist. 
  The man was released later after being cleared. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said earlier 
yesterday it was too early to say if the bomb had any connection 
with the World Trade Center bombing. 
  Mr. Banyat said he was waiting for the findings of 
government 
agencies seeking to establish the identities of the people who 
made the bomb. 
  Earlier this year police distributed photographs of three 
Pakistanis, wanted by the U.S. and carrying a reward of $2 
million, believed to be responsible for the bombing of the World 
Trade Centre and hiding somewhere in Thailand. 
  The three were identified as Mir Aimal Kansi (or Kasi), 
Muhammad Farooq and Ramzi Ahmad Yousef. 
  Mr. Banyat said he had reported to Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai in Vietnam about the incident.

  [Text] Officials of a U.S. antiterrorist unit reportedly 
will come to investigate the explosives and sabotage preparation 
methods to see which group might be responsible for the bombing. 
Investigators have focused their attention on the Muslim fanatic 
group which calls itself "Jihad" or militant Muslim groups which 
have been long-standing enemies of Israel. 
  According to a report, in 1992 members of these groups 
detonated a bomb-laden truck which they parked in front of the 
Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 20 instantly and 
wounding 240 others. This method is similar to the one planned 
for Thailand. The C-4 explosives used in that explosion are the 
same type that were found in the tank on the six-wheel truck in 
Bangkok on 17 March. 
  The method and type of explosive, in addition to support 
from 
terrorist groups seeking the separation of southern Thailand, 
led police to focus on the above mentioned groups. This theory 
matches the investigation result which shows that part of the 
financial support came from Sungai Kolok District, Narathiwat 
Province. Also, there must be support from residents in 
Thailand to facilitate travel by the suspects around the country. 
  The Metropolitan Police investigation team's questioning of 
witnesses reportedly resulted in naming four suspects: Mr. 
Wudera Wankuwa, Mr. Konsak Ayat Manusuk, Mr. Mohamad Talao, and 
Mr. Asmal Dansis Hakare. The Immigration Office has been asked 
to check the arrival and departure records of these people.

  [Text] Australia has approved a request to change the name 
of the Canberra office of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
The title of the PLO office will be changed to the General 
Palestinian Delegation. 
  Announcing the move, Australia's foreign minister, Gareth 
Evans, said it did not involve any change in the diplomatic 
status of the PLO's representation. It did not involve the 
granting of any diplomatic privileges or immunities. 
  Senator Evans said conditions had not been satisfied for 
Australia to recognize Palestine as a sovereign state or the PLO 
as a government of a state. Australia's foreign minister has 
said the creation of an independent state of Palestine might 
well be the independent ultimate outcome of the peace process, 
but it was premature to anticipate the process at this stage.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- The U.S. Government 
permitted Japan Airlines Co. (JAL) to operate a charter flight 
Thursday [17 March] from Sendai, northern Japan, to Hawaii after 
Washington delayed permission to JAL for regular flights on the 
route, the Transport Ministry said. Washington decided to 
postpone permission for JAL's weekly flights from Sendai to 
Honolulu, prompting protest from the Japanese airline which had 
planned to launch the new route on Thursday afternoon. 
  JAL immediately asked the United States to allow it to 
operate a charter flight to Hawaii to carry 275 passengers who 
already have booked the seats on the scheduled flight. JAL will 
use an airplane of its subsidiary Japan Air Charter for the 
flight to Hawaii. 
  Ministry officials said Wednesday that the United States has 
not given an explanation for the postponement of approval for 
the regular flights, but said it is probably a response to 
Japan's refusal to expand "beyond rights" for U.S. airlines 
flying to Japan that allow them to extend their routes to third 
countries.

<F P=106> ["News Focus" by Keiji Urakami: "U.S. Replacing Japan as </F>
Global Leader in Key Industries"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, March 19 KYODO -- American companies are 
making a comeback as global industrial leaders, with the 
technological edge long enjoyed by Japanese makers recently 
shaken in key sectors. 
  "Japan has completely lost out to the United States in the 
industrial race in leading sectors like electricals [as 
received] and autos," Ryuzaburo Kaku, chairman of Canon Inc., 
said, voicing fears over the accelerating U.S. counteroffensive. 
Kaku is not alone in such fears. 
  Fumio Sato, president of Toshiba Corp., said, "Japanese 
companies, if the current situation is left unattended, will end 
up becoming subcontractors of U.S. firms." The sense of crisis 
has spread to corporate managers at many of Japan's major 
companies, which had until only a few years ago enjoyed an 
overwhelming dominance in global markets. 
  It was not long ago that Sony and Matsushita were regarded 
as 
a menace to many U.S. companies when they marched out in the 
U.S. marketplace brandishing superior products and enormous 
financial power. 
  THE NEW YORK TIMES recently reported U.S. companies have 
regained competitiveness against Japanese and German firms 
thanks to efforts at introducing innovative technologies. 
  Per-capita productivity for U.S. workers has become the 
world's highest at 49,600 dollars, surpassing that for German 
workers by 5,000 dollars and Japanese workers by 10,000 dollars, 
the paper said. 
  "Although Nintendo was born in Japan, further imagination 
does not seem to have been born in this country," [Salomon 
company employee] Chiwaki said, citing lagging infrastructure 
for interactive multimedia compared with Western countries. 
  As an example of Japan's unpreparedness to support the 
multimedia revolution, Chiwaki cited the limited 20 percent 
penetration of cable television in this country against 60 
percent in the U.S. He also noted the lagging use of personal 
computers in school education in Japan -- about one-third the 
level of the U.S. 
  "The general consensus is growing that the interactive 
multimedia industry will be born in the U.S., not in Japan," he 
said. 
  The outlook for Japanese companies is also dismal in 
semiconductors, staple products often figuratively called the 
"rice of industry." The share of U.S. makers in the global chip 
market is believed to have exceeded that of Japanese companies 
for the first time in 1993, industry observers said. 
  According to the U.S. research company Dataquest, global 
Japanese and U.S. chip shares were roughly equal in 1992, the 
latest year for which data are available -- 42.3 percent for 
Japanese makers and 41.5 percent for U.S. makers. 
  On a maker basis, the global chip sales share in 1993 came 
to 
9.6 percent for Intel Corp. and 7.4 percent for NEC Corp., 
according to Dataquest. This means Intel's lead over NEC 
widened from 1992 when Intel outdid the Japanese company for the 
first time, by a narrow margin of 7.8 percent to 7.5 percent. 
  Japanese chipmakers have also been facing an offensive by 
South Korean firms. Samsung Electronics Co., for example, has 
become the world's biggest maker of dynamic random access memory 
(DRAM) chips. 
  "The technical lead of Japanese chip makers is a thing of 
the 
past," said an analyst at Daiwa Institute of Research who 
declined to be named. "The situation will continue to be severe 
for Japanese makers," he said, noting that U.S. and South Korean 
makers are aggressive about capital investment while Japanese 
companies are reluctant about such spending under the lingering 
recession. 
  Nor are autos and home electrical appliances immune to the 
U.S. counterattacks. 
  Chrysler Corp., for example, is outshining Japanese 
carmakers 
in the U.S. market with the launch of its exceptionally 
reasonably-priced subcompact, the Neon. The auto, dubbed the 
"Japanese-killer car," is priced at less than 9,000 dollars, 
2,000 dollars below comparable Japanese cars. 
  The Japanese auto industry fears the Neons will land in 
Japan 
in the near future. 
  "U.S. automakers learned a lot from the success of Japanese 
carmakers," said a top executive of a major Japanese auto parts 
maker. "The quality gap between Japanese and U.S. cars has 
narrowed to `10 to 8' from `10 to 5' five or six years ago." 
  Salomon's Chiwaki warned that Japan will also be in a 
disadvantageous position in the international race for the 
development of high-definition television (HDTV), unless the 
country changes its policy from support of the analog 
transmission format to support of the digital system. 
  "The global trend toward a digital format can never be 
reversed," said Chiwaki. "The U.S. is far ahead of Japan in 
this area." 
  Experts say digital transmission represents more than just a 
path to razor-sharp images on the TV screen. Digital 
technology, the same as computers use, has the potential to 
support a variety of new communications tools in the era of 
multimedia when the marriage of computers and communications 
systems is expected to dramatically transform people's lives. 
  Japan's receipts of patent-licensing revenues from abroad, a 
key gauge of a country's technology levels, came to 386.5 
billion yen in 1992 compared with a much larger 910.1 billion 
yen in payments, according to the Bank of Japan. 
  Meanwhile, the U.S. registered about 1.9 trillion yen in net 
receipts of patent-related revenues, becoming the only country 
among major nations to enjoy net technology exports. 
  Hisashi Kaneko, senior managing director of NEC, said the 
widely believed story that Japan came from behind to win an 
economic race with the U.S. from the late 1980s to the early 
1990s is "an illusion."

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- Feelings of reverence 
for the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il are deepening among the 
South Korean people, the Seoul-based radio Voice of National 
Salvation reported. A middle school teacher surnamed Kim in 
Ryongin-myon, San county, South Chungchong Province, talking 
with villagers about the situation some time ago said: "The 
dear leader Kim Chong-il is a peerless legendary hero and 
mythical great man. 
  "There are many myth-like stories about his outstanding 
guidance and leadership ability. 
  "He is indeed a [word indistinct] of the times possessed of 
almighty strength and wisdom and a distinguished great man 
produced by heaven." 
  An old man Choe Ho was once a scholar, said: 
  "When I was young I majored in history. History has not 
known 
of such leader as the dear leader Kim Chong-il who sends 
birthday tables to unknown old persons. 
  "He shapes a man [words indistinct], placing the people in 
the centre of all thinking and making everything serve them. 
  "My supreme wish is to live under his administration." 
  One day in late February, Professor Kim in Tongrae District, 
Husan, told his colleagues: 
  "During my trip to a European country toward the end of last 
year, a university professor there invited me to his home. A 
picture of dear General Kim Chong-il was placed in the centre of 
his study. He showed me the dear leader's works and told me 
that he was an adherent to the great chuche idea, the sole 
guiding idea of the present time. [Words indistinct] Comrade 
Kim Chong-il who indicates the path head of mankind and wisely 
guides them. 
  "Hearing his words, I felt a great national [words 
indistinct], reunification, looking up to the wise General Kim 
Chong-il as the leader of the nation."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Anticommunist Fascist </F>
Maniac's Colors, Which Have Been Exposed More Clearly"] 
  [Text] According to broadcast reports from Seoul, puppet 
traitor Kim Yong-sam and Yi Ki-taek, chairman of the opposition 
Democratic Party, held talks at Chongwadae [presidential office] 
on 10 March. During the talks, they reportedly discussed the 
revision of the National Security Law, the suppression of human 
rights, the visit to the North by Chairman Yi Ki-taek, and the 
reopening of the Uruguay Round negotiations. It was reported 
puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam flatly said they were impossible. 
  This clearly shows his colors as a vicious fascist maniac, 
an 
anticommunist fanatic, and a national betrayer. This also is a 
vicious challenge to and a mockery of the South Korean people 
who demand that the Uruguay Round negotiations be reopened. 
  When the Democratic Party chairman demanded that the 
National 
Security Law be revised, puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam stubbornly 
insisted that it was impossible to abolish the National Security 
Law, while stating that someone else's ambition to communize 
South Korea had not changed. 
  The puppet traitor said that he could not abolish the 
National Security Law in a vicious attempt to maintain the 
vicious antireunification fascist law, pursue North-South 
confrontation, further step up his civilian fascist 
dictatorship, and, thus, brutally suppress the South Korean 
people's righteous struggle for independence, democracy, and 
reunification. 
  As everyone knows, the National Security Law is a legacy of 
the era of the military fascist dictatorship that made 
anticommunism, North-South confrontation, and a fascist 
terrorist rule their undertakings. It is a vicious 
antinational, antireunification law that declares the fellow 
countrymen the enemy, negates reunification, blocks dialogue, 
and opposes improved North-South relations and an unprecedented 
vicious fascist law promulgated to suppress democratic forces 
for reunification, viciously trample people's democratic and 
human rights, and justify terrorist acts against and murders of 
political opponents. Therefore, South Korean people, human 
rights organizations of the world, and Amnesty International 
have strongly demanded that the National Security Law be 
abolished in South Korea. Moreover, even high-ranking U.S. 
authorities repeatedly confirmed that abolishing the National 
Security Law is the U.S. Government's official position and 
demanded that it be abolished. 
  Abolishing the notorious National Security Law in South 
Korea 
is the era's demand, which can no longer be delayed. 
Nevertheless, traitor Kim Yong-sam persistently opposed the 
abolition of the National Security Law. This again shows the 
bastard is a fascist tyrant and a vicious divisionist. 
  Puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam stated the North's ambition to 
achieve reunification under communist terms is what prevents the 
abolition of the National Security Law. This is a shameless act 
of deceiving reality and is idle talk. 
  The reunification we advocate is a reunification under a 
confederal system based on great national unity. It is traitor 
Kim Yong-sam and his cohorts who oppose reunifying the country 
based on the principle of coexistence that neither side swallows 
or is swallowed by the other. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique, which had inspired North-South 
confrontation and frantically prepared for war to harm its 
fellow countrymen and even babbled about an international 
cooperation system, made those remarks. This is preposterous. 
  Puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam flatly rejected the visit to 
Pyongyang by Democratic Party Chairman Yi Ki-taek, saying that 
it would not be good for him to visit the North. This is part 
of his criminal maneuvers to block national reconciliation and 
unity and inspire North-South confrontation. 
  During his New Year news conference, the Democratic Party 
chairman expressed worry about current North-South relations and 
expressed his intention to visit Pyongyang to help improve 
deadlocked North-South relations. At that time, we acknowledged 
this was a patriotic idea that anyone who worries about the 
destiny of the country and the nation should have and supported 
and welcomed it. 
  The government of our Republic proposed bilateral or 
multilateral negotiations among leading politicians in the North 
and South out of an earnest desire to promote great national 
unity and reunify the fatherland after transcending differences 
in ideas, ideology, and systems and has made sincere efforts to 
implement this proposal. For leading politicians of the North 
and South to gather and jointly probe ways to end the tense 
confrontation within the nation and open a new phase in peace in 
the country and its peaceful reunification is not 
disadvantageous, but beneficial to the fatherland's 
reunification. 
  Nevertheless, traitor Kim Yong-sam opposed the visit to the 
North by the Democratic Party chairman. This is designed to 
block multipronged North-South dialogue, monopolize North-South 
dialogue, and use it as a means to promote North-South 
confrontation just like the former dictators. 
  Puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam babbled it is impossible to 
reopen the Uruguay Round negotiations. This is intended to open 
the South Korean rice market at all costs. This is an act that 
can only be committed by the vicious toadyist nation-seller and 
top-class colonial running dog who does not hesitate to do what 
his masters ask him to do, regardless of the destiny of the 6 
million South Korean farmers and tens of millions of South 
Korean people. 
  All facts show traitor Kim Yong-sam is an unprecedented 
fascist tyrant, antireunification element, and treacherous 
traitor. Traitor Kim Yong-sam, who pursues fascism, perpetual 
division, and treachery more frantically as time goes by, will 
not be able to escape from the people's harsh punishment. 
Traitor Kim Yong-sam must squarely see the growing 
antigovernment sentiment in South Korea and act with discretion 
and resign from power without delay before being subjected to 
the stern judgment of history.

  [Text] Havana, March 18 (KCNA) -- Kim Chang-su, deputy 
chief of the Havana mission of the South Korean National 
Democratic Front (Hanminjon), called a press conference here on 
March 15 and exposed the dangerous nature of the nuclear frenzy 
of the South Korean puppet clique. 
  He disclosed that a huge amount of nuclear waste has 
annually 
come from the nuclear power stations now under operation in 
South Korea and their storing facilities in South Korea have 
already reached the limit. 
  South Korea has turned into a nuclear powder magazine in the 
true sense of the term due to the nuclear weapons development 
manoeuvrings of the puppet clique and the deployment of more 
than one thousand nuclear weapons of the U.S. forces, he noted. 
  He referred to the racket kicked up by the puppets over the 
fictitious "nuclear issue" of the North as an intrigue to cover 
up their nuclear armament. 
  Nuclear threat comes from the South, not from the North, he 
said, adding that the South Korean authorities should 
unconditionally and immediately get the U.S. nuclear weapons, 
the hotbed of a nuclear war, withdrawn and discontinue for good 
the "Team Spirit" manoeuvres that may cause a nuclear war.

<F P=106> ["Hanminjon on Kim Yong-sam's Criminal Records Marked by </F>
Metamorphosis and Treachery" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 20 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee 
of the South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF] 
(Hanminjon) issued a white paper on March 15 shedding a 
revealing light on the criminal acts of the sycophant traitor 
Kim Yong-sam who has put the brakes on the movement for 
independence, democracy and reunification, engaging himself in 
metamorphosis and treacheries, according to a report of the 
radio Voice of National Salvation from Seoul. 
  The white paper says although there had been numerous 
political charlatans in South Korea, there has been no such a 
special-class turncoat well-versed in flip-flaps like Kim 
Yong-sam who gratified his greed for power by traveling between 
the ruling and the opposition and repeatedly changing his 
political views. 
  It further says: 
  No sooner had Kim Yong-sam entered upon his political career 
than he found himself among the one hundred thirty-six 
initiators of a "constitutional amendment bill" to make the 
traitor Syngman Rhee, a pro-American dictator, a "life 
president" in November 1954 and when the bill was voted down at 
the "National Assembly", he became one of the twenty "National 
Assemblymen" from the "Freedom Party" who rattled the bill 
through the parliament by phony calculation such as counting as 
one fractions of .5. 
  Later, informed about the truth behind "Operation Ever 
Ready", a plot weaved by the U.S. to remove Syngman Rhee, Kim 
Yong-sam lost no time but broke away from the "Freedom Party" in 
December 1954 and joined the opposition Democratic Party. 
  After shifting to the side of the opposition, the political 
charlatan had resorted to every conceivable means of political 
frauds, swindle and tricks to disguise himself as a "champion of 
democracy against dictatorship" for 35 years till he came to be 
embraced by the dictator through the merger of three parties. 
  In January 1990 Kim Yong-sam partook of the U.S. 
imperialists' grand compromise strategy intended to totally 
block the anti-U.S., anti-fascist action of the popular masses 
and maintain and prolong the pro-American "military government" 
by merging the ruling "military government" and the 
conservative opposition force and thus saved the No Tae-u group 
from the blind alley to which it had been driven, and committed 
a criminal act of laying a stumbling-block in the way of the 
movement for independence, democracy and reunification. 
  Seating himself at the helm of dictatorial power, Kim 
Yong-sam openly backpedaled on the fine-sounding commitments to 
"democratisation" he had made before his assumption of office 
through a fascist frenzy of the "civilian" dictatorship. 
  The traitor has brandished the sword against the people 
while 
unhesitatingly granting unprecedented leniency for the former 
dictators, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, with the assurances that 
"the unsatisfactory past would no longer be made a topic for 
discussion". 
  The Kim Yong-sam group placed on the backburner its promise 
to "do its utmost for the growth of minor enterprises" and 
concentrated more than sixty percent of the treasury funds on 
big businesses. As a consequence, more than 4,300 minor 
businesses went bankrupt last year, leaving one million people 
jobless. 
  Kim Yong-sam went the length of invoking the fascist 
"emergency arbitration power" which even those of the "Fifth and 
Sixth Republics had not dared to do, in brutally suppressing the 
workers' struggle for their right to existence. 
  On the plea of "eradication of corruption", Kim Yong-sam 
increased his family property by more than 590,000,000 won in 
six months or so and his secretaries collected 39,000 million 
won as political funds at the backroom of "Chongwadae" 
[presidential office]. 
  The so-called "doctrine on the superiority of the nation" 
uttered by the traitor Kim in his "presidential" inauguration 
address turned into a "doctrine on the inferiority of the 
nation" and a "doctrine of hostility against the nation", and 
his "policy of improving relations" with the North was replaced 
by a "policy of aggravating relations". 
  The white paper brands the traitor Kim Yong-sam as a 
political charlatan who has no philosophy of his own, no 
political view and has no regard for the nation and people, and 
as a two-bit shyster who has not an iota of conscience as a 
human being and no creed as a politician. 
  The white paper says that all the people must immediately 
topple the traitor Kim Yong-sam whom they need not to watch or 
expect from any longer, and open a broad avenue for 
independence, democracy and reunification.

<F P=106> ["S. Korea Must Be Held Responsible for Abortive Exchange of </F>
Special Envoys" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- The South side has 
driven the working contact for the exchange of presidential 
envoys between the North and the South of Korea to a rupture, 
leading the North-South relations to an all the more acute and 
perilous phase. This will be recorded in history as another 
crime of the blackest dye to be a target of denunciation from 
the entire fellow countrymen. 
  MINJU CHOSON says this in a commentary today. 
  The analyst says: 
  The South side came out to the working contact, motivated by 
a premeditated scheme to veil the ugly color of the 
anti-democratic, anti-reunification "civilian" regime, boost his 
daily descending popularity and balk the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  It got frenzied in solicitation diplomacy with foreign 
forces 
outside the conference hall in a bid to reverse the agreed 
conclusions reached between the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea and the United States at the New York contact, while 
showing an insincere and dishonest attitude at the talks, 
intentionally laying obstacles to the discussion of working 
matters. 
  Prior to the eighth working contact, the South side held "a 
high-level strategic meeting" and openly cried for "a tough 
reaction" to its dialogue partner. It also provocatively blared 
that it would resume the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises, 
push ahead with the plan to introduce patriot missiles in South 
Korea and join in "international sanctions" against the North. 
  This was obviously a declaration that it negates the 
exchange 
of special envoys and a declaration of confrontation and war. 
  All the facts prove that the South side has used the working 
contact as a means of casting a chill over the DPRK-U.S. talks 
and hampering it. 
  The South side can never evade its responsibility for the 
collapse of the working contact. 
  It must clearly know what grave consequences its criminal 
acts will entail.

<F P=106> ["Book `Human Rights Situation in South Korea' Off" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- The Institute for the 
Research of Human Rights of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea released a book "The Human Rights Situation in South 
Korea". 
  Published in English by the Foreign Language Publishing 
House, the book consists of six chapters -- "Institutional 
Device Used To Infringe Upon Democracy and Human Rights", 
"Debris of Democracy", "Barren Land Devoid of Human Rights", 
"`Exhibition Hall' of Intelligence, Surveillance and Stratagem", 
"The Acme of Infringement on Democratic Human Rights" and "The 
United States and the Absence of Democracy and Human Rights in 
South Korea". 
  In the preface, the book says that the problem of human 
rights in South Korea is of great concern for the international 
community and deeply worries a great number of people who love 
justice and truth. The seriousness of the human rights issue in 
South Korea, the book says, is clearly reflected in the "Report 
on Human Rights in South Korea" submitted by the "International 
League for Human Rights" and the "International Group on the Law 
of Human Rights" (Washington, February 1985), the report 
"Infringement of Human Rights in South Korea" submitted by 
"Amnesty International" (London, 1986), and the "White Paper on 
Human Rights in South Korea" submitted by the "International 
Association of Democratic Lawyers" (Paris, June 1991). 
  The book points out that all kinds of evil laws in force in 
South Korea number more than 200. 
  It also fully exposes the craftiness, viciousness and 
anti-democratic, anti-national and anti-reunification nature of 
the "Law on Supervision for Public Peace", "Law on National 
Security Planning Board" and "Law on Assembly and Demonstration" 
including the most fascist and brutal "National Security Law". 
  The book cites facts to prove that South Korea which has 
been 
a target of the U.S. colonial rule for nearly half a century has 
become a barren land of human rights and an acme of human rights 
violation. 
  The institute lays bare the human rights situation of South 
Korea in recent years, denouncing the moves of the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean authorities in deceiving and 
mocking world public opinion as criminal acts going against the 
flow of the present times and as challenges to world conscience.

<F P=106> ["`Civilian' Poodle Brandishes Sword" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
runs a commentary denouncing the Kim Yong-sam group for 
criminalizing and brutally suppressing students who rose up in 
an anti-American struggle. 
  Recalling that the puppets mercilessly cracked down upon the 
struggle of students affiliated with the Eastern Seoul district 
Federation of General Student Councils including Hanyang and 
Konkuk Universities against agricultural market opening and the 
anti-American struggle of students under the Pusan-South 
Kyongsang Provincial Federation of General Student Councils, the 
analyst of the paper says: 
  This clearly shows once again the vicious and treacherous 
nature of the "civilian"-veiled Kim Yong-sam puppet clique. 
  The anti-American struggle of students is an eruption of 
their resolute will not to tolerate the U.S. moves of aggression 
and war which are becoming all the more unscrupulous and 
virulent with the passage of times. 
  The righteous struggle of students that must be praised as 
patriotic is suppressed by the Kim Yong-sam group which styles 
itself "civilian". Such thing can be committed only by the 
despicable pro-American flunkeyist traitors who are prolonging 
their days by clinging to the coattail of the United States, 
their master. 
  Kim Yong-sam is a rank traitor who has served the United 
States like his "grandfather" and took the "presidential" seat 
with the U.S. approval. So, he is wielding the sword at the 
patriotic movement for national independence and unhesitatingly 
committed such anti-national crimes as desperately opposing the 
principle of national independence at the working contact for 
the exchange of special envoys and leading it to a rupture. 
  If a disaster is to be avoided, the "civilian" poodle, the 
guide to the robber, must be removed together with the intruder.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- Professors belonging 
to the National Council of Professors for Democracy (Mingyohyop) 
released "Appraisal of Policies of `Civilian Regime'" exposing 
the deceptive and anti-national nature of the "reform" pursued 
by the Kim Yong-sam regime over the last one year, according to 
the March issue of the South Korean magazine KIL. 
  In the appraisal, the professors stripped bare the 
treacherous nature of the "reform" by the Kim Yong-sam regime, 
characterising it as "subordinate politics and diplomacy," "big 
business-centred new economy against reform," "new agricultural 
policy driving away peasants," "government-controlled education 
denying change," "return to the cold war 
system--anti-independent reunification policy" and "retrograding 
environmental policy". 
  They branded the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime as "power for 
comprador businesses" and "power bent on consolidating the 
subordinate relations with the imperialist powers, particularly 
the U.S. imperialist total capital". 
  They pointed out that the revision of the "Combined Election 
Law", the "Law on Political Funds", etc. sought by the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique is not for a democratic reform, but is 
aimed at consolidating the foundation of their power by 
legalizing the political and economic fusion between the 
"Democratic Liberal Party" and the comprador businesses through 
the medium of "political funds". 
  Stating that the deceptive nature of the "reform" advertised 
so loudly by the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique has been completely 
exposed, they said it is proved by the fact that the force which 
must be the objects of reform are fooling the people in the 
disguise of the "leading force" of the "reform".

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- The spokesman of the 
Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland 
[CPRF] published a statement today denouncing the South Korean 
authorities for racing toward confrontation and war, totally 
blocking the exchange of presidential envoys and dialogue 
between the North and the South. 
  The statement says the developments today clearly show that 
from the very beginning the South Korean ruling quarters did not 
want peace and peaceful reunification of the country, not to 
speak of the exchange of special envoys, but used the 
North-South dialogue for their insidious aim of putting the 
brakes on the DPRK-USA talks. 
  As already reported, the statement continues, on the 
threshold of the 8th working contact for the exchange of special 
envoys held Saturday, the South Korean authorities held "a 
high-level strategic meeting," at which they threatened "a tough 
reaction" and cried for the resumption of the Team Spirit 
nuclear war exercises, introduction of Patriot missiles and 
participation of South Korea in the international "sanctions." 
  These provocative acts of the South Korean authorities 
predicted the destiny of the exchange of special envoys and the 
harassment of peace. 
  The situation has taken that course today. 
  At the March 19 contact, the South side took a position of 
virtually declaring break with us, thus bringing the working 
contact itself to a rupture, and it is now driving the situation 
on the Korean peninsula to an acute phase of war. 
  The provocative steps taken at the so-called "meeting of 
security-related ministers" on March 21 were a sort of 
declaration of total confrontation and a declaration of war 
against us. 
  From shortly after this reckless provocative declaration of 
the puppet rulers, the puppet Army forces entered into an 
"emergency alert" in South Korea and there are signs of moves 
for bringing new military equipment including Patriot missiles 
from the United States. 
  The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the 
Fatherland resolutely denounces in the name of the entire Korean 
people the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique for unilaterally breaking 
up the dialogue with fellow countrymen and pushing the situation 
of the country to a very dangerous brink of war by following 
outside forces. 
  The reality in which the situation of the country is rushing 
to a new phase of war urges the whole nation to see with high 
consciousness what a grave situation has been caused by the 
criminal acts of the Kim Yong-sam group in abandoning the 
North-South dialogue and obstructing the DPRK-USA talks. 
  Facts tell that the North and the South may fall a victim to 
outside forces, failing to achieve reconciliation and 
reunification, while such flunkeyist traitors to the nation as 
the Kim Yong-sam group are left alone in the country, the 
traitors who set greater store by the interests of outside 
forces than by the security and interests of the nation and 
think more of their personal comfort and distinction than of the 
destiny of the nation. 
  Now, the Kim Yong-sam group has become unable to conceal the 
fact that it is an anti-national group which blocks dialogue 
between the fellow countrymen and seeks to inflict the scourge 
of war upon the nation, keeping foreign forces within the 
country. 
  Traitors to the nation must be removed and liquidated within 
the nation as early as possible.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 20 (KCNA) -- Students affiliated 
with the Pusan and South Kyongsang provincial federation of 
general student councils broke into a U.S. military base in 
Pusan and staged a protest sit-in on the evening of March 18 
marking the 12th anniversary of the arson on the "American 
cultural centre" in Pusan, the Seoul-based "Christian 
Broadcasting System" reported. 
  The protesters handed over to the U.S. forces side a letter 
of protest addressed to the U.S. Administration, shouting "Away 
with the U.S. Forces" and "A permanent stop to the `Team Spirit' 
war exercises". 
  In the letter written in the name of the Pusan and South 
Kyongsang Provincial Federation of General Student Councils the 
students strongly demanded that the United States stop putting 
pressure upon South Korea to liberalize import, including the 
rice market opening pressure, and abandon the planned deployment 
of Patriot missiles in South Korea and dismantle the U.S. 
military bases. 
  That day the Kim Yong-sam group arrested all the 
participants 
in the sit-in. 
  According to a radio report from Seoul, more than one 
thousand students under the Eastern Seoul District Federation of 
General Student Councils including those of Hanyang and Konkuk 
Universities held a rally at Hanyang University on the afternoon 
of March 18 and bitterly condemned the Kim Yong-sam group's 
criminal act in illegally submitting to the United States a plan 
on the implementation of farm produce market opening. 
  The students branded the criminal act of the Kim Yong-sam 
"regime" in presenting beforehand the "final implementation plan 
on the Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations" to the United 
States in mid-February in secrecy as an "obvious act of 
pro-American flunkeyist treachery". 
  They called for an all-people struggle against a 
"parliamentary ratification of the bill" on farm produce market 
opening. 
  Then they burnt a stars and stripes and staged a 
demonstration, shouting "We oppose the Uruguay Round" and 
"Yankee, go home".

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- Leon Nzokene, general 
secretary of the Congolese Socialist Party, told the DPRK 
ambassador March 15 that the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula should be settled through talks between the DPRK and 
the United States, the parties concerned. 
  He demanded that the United States withdraw the unreasonable 
preconditions. 
  Reinaldo Tefelvelez, first vice-chairman of the National 
Assembly of Nicaragua, in a statement March 8 said that if the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is to be settled, the 
United States must withdraw its nuclear weapons from South 
Korea, withdraw its unreasonable preconditions in the 
implementation of the steps of simultaneous action agreed upon 
at the DPRK-U.S. contact and sincerely approach the talks. 
  If the United States is really interested in dialogue, it 
must prove this in practice and stop the anti-DPRK campaign, 
first of all, he urged. 
  The French committee for recognizing the DPRK in a statement 
March 15 said the United States must not abuse the International 
Atomic Energy Agency and the international community for 
justifying its sinister policy of stifling socialist Korea. 
  The statement strongly demanded that the United States 
refrain from seeking a sinister political purpose with 
unilateral demands to the DPRK.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 19 (KCNA) -- Broad public circles 
of the world are exposing the truth behind the issue of the 
"comfort women for the army" and strongly demanding that the 
Japanese Government make an apology and adequate compensations 
for it. 
  WASHINGTON TIMES said Seiji Yoshida, an officer of the old 
Japanese Army, confessed that he, together with his men, 
kidnapped more than 1,000 young Korean girls as "comfort women 
fo the army" and threw them into a concentration camp, but he 
had not been put to a trial after the war. 
  Noting that nearly 200,000 Korean women are said to have 
been 
drafted as "comfort women for the army", the paper said such 
atrocities were committed on the instructions of the then top 
authorities of Japan. 
  The Belgian paper SOLIDAIRE said the Japanese Army not only 
forcibly drafted Korean women as sex slaves but also 
unhesitatingly committed such beastly atrocities as murdering 
"comfort women" by dismembering and burning them in groups after 
satisfying their sexual desire. 
  The Malaysian paper SIN CHEW JIT POH said that the Japanese 
"imperial Army's" history of rape and murder was a filthy 
history, a history of ruining women. 
  Hiroshi Takeuchi, mayor of Handa, Japan, told a press 
conference that truth is one, not two or three, however hard the 
government may try to conceal facts. He demanded a clear probe 
into the damages inflicted upon the Korean people and their 
backgrounds. 
  Lidi Alajandro, general secretary of the New Progressive 
Union of the Philippines, recalled that the Japanese 
imperialists drafted a large number of women and forced them to 
serve as "comfort women for the army" during the Second World 
War. He said this is unpardonable and Japanese Government must 
bear responsibility for this. 
  The AZAP News Agency of Zaire said the Japanese Government 
could never evade its responsibility for the misfortunes and 
sufferings inflicted upon the Korean people and human rights 
abuses. It must make a proper apology and compensations to the 
DPRK Government, urged the news agency.

<F P=106> ["Japan Surfacing as New War Force" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- Japan, which has 
surfaced as a new war force, is the topic of a NODONG SINMUN 
article today. 
  Japan, going against the international trend toward detente, 
is accelerating its conversion into a military power and its 
nuclear armament and overseas expansion, thus coming to the fore 
as a new dangerous hotbed of war, the author of the article 
says, and goes on: 
  Japan is pursuing the policy of strength behind the 
post-cold 
war scene. This is fully illustrated by the fact that the 
war-thirsty elements of Japan are making desperate efforts to 
establish a social system for a war of aggression. 
  The Japanese rightwing conservative forces are scheming to 
revise the Constitution, while building up the "Self-Defence 
Forces" [SDF] into one of the leading aggression forces in the 
world through the systematic increase of military expenditures 
every year. 
  Japan rattled "the bill on cooperation in the United Nations 
peacekeeping operation" through the Diet to legalize the 
overseas dispatch of the "SDF." Now it intends to create legal 
conditions for a war of aggression, crying for "the revision of 
the SDF law" and "the study and enactment of the law on the 
event of contingency." 
  The nature of Japan as a new war force is glaringly revealed 
in its crackbrained rush for the building of a military power 
and its nuclear armament. 
  Japan is far higher than any other Western countries in the 
rate of the increase of military expenditures. Now it has 
reached the second topmost rung on the global ladder of military 
spendings. 
  The Japanese reactionaries are hastening at break-neck speed 
the increase of the fire power of the "SDF," its high-tech 
equipment and attainment of greater mobility and buildup of 
long-range operation capacity with stress on the qualitative 
reinforcement of the "SDF", not leaning too much to quantitative 
growth. 
  Getting mad over overseas aggression, the Japanese 
militarists have reshaped the defensive structure of the "SDF" 
into an offensive one, adopted a forestalling-attack strategy in 
place of the "defence-oriented strategy" and expanded the 
operational sphere into extensive regions of Northeast Asia and 
the Pacific. 
  It is nobody's secret that Japan's nuclear armament is near 
completion and its nuclear range will cover every part of the 
globe in the future. 
  Japan, which appeared on the scene as a new war force, is 
now 
following in the footsteps of its defunct militarists who faced 
a stern judgment by history after launching into aggression 
under the cloak of "peace of the East." 
  The Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion, mindful 
that their policy of aggression and war will lead them to 
destruction.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- The Bulgarian paper 
TRIBUNA March 12 carried an article titled "Soap Bubbles Burst" 
and "U.S. Yields to Resolute Position of DPRK." 
  The article said the DPRK achieved a successful economic 
progress under the rigorous international situation caused by 
the intensified campaign of the west to stifle it. 
  The article continued: 
  In the 1987-1993 period, the industrial output rose 1.5 
times 
and the average annual growth rate was 5.6 percent. 
  The wages of factory and office workers, the social security 
pensions and the scholarships for the university and college 
students jumped more than 40 percent. 
  The U.S.-led imperialist forces have resorted to economic 
and 
diplomatic pressure and military threat in order to isolate and 
stifle the DPRK. 
  The "nuclear issue" is a typical example. 
  The Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency, 
which has been reduced to a branch of the U.S. intelligence 
service, tried to make "a special inspection" of military sites 
of the DPRK. 
  In Korea, all people are armed and the whole country is 
fortified. 
  The DPRK Government solemnly declared its withdrawal from 
the 
nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This unexpected, resolute step 
totally upset the camp of U.S. imperialism which boasts of being 
"the only superpower" in the world. 
  In face of the brilliant wisdom, iron will and matchless 
grit 
of a great general and the singlehearted unity of the whole Army 
and the entire people around him, the imperialists' show of 
power was shattered to smithereens like soap bubbles hitting a 
rock. 
  In June 1993, the United States was compelled to come out to 
the negotiating table. 
  The achievements made by the DPRK in the political, 
economic, 
military and all other fields serve as a source of confidence 
and courage for the progressive people of the world and all 
people anguishing under imperialist oppression.

-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 20 (KCNA) -- The Korean people's 
faith in socialism is an unshakable and unbreakable one and will 
be everlasting, being successfully carried forward through 
generations, stresses NODONG SINMUN in a signed article today. 
  The article says: 
  Now the Korean-style socialism is making a long drive, not 
wavering in any howling wind, because the steadfast faith in 
socialism of chuche which is advancing confidently under the 
guidance of the party and the leader has struck its roots deep 
in the hearts of our people. 
  The Korean people accept the socialist idea of chuche as 
their faith and are making the revolution and construction as 
demanded by it. And they are struggling with a great pride and 
honor of living and making the revolution in the most 
advantageous socialist society in the world. 
  They are firmly convinced through the course of giving full 
play to the dignity and might of the Korean-style socialism 
under the banner of the socialist idea of chuche that they can 
accomplish the cause of socialism when they take as the 
guideline of their struggle the socialist idea of chuche which 
is being developed and completed by the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. 
  This faith of our people is immutable and strongest even 
under the circumstances in which the imperialists are 
intensifying anti-socialist moves, loudly advertising "material 
prosperity" and "advantages" of capitalism. 
  The whole society forms one big family and an independent 
and 
creative, socialist life of the people is in full bloom, with 
the entire people united behind the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il in one mind. Our people deeply bear in mind through 
the present-day reality and the miserable situation in the 
countries where socialism has suffered a setback that capitalism 
has nothing to present to the people. Hence, our people's faith 
in socialism cannot be shaken with anything. 
  The Korean people wholly integrate socialism with their 
destiny and devote their all to the struggle to defend socialism.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- Local industry is 
booming in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  Over the past thirty years more than 2,500 local industrial 
factories have made their appearance throughout the country and 
their modernisation level improved considerably. 
  Foodstuff, textile, garment, paper-making and other local 
industrial factories, over twenty on an average, have been 
built in cities and counties which had only a few ones thirty 
years ago. 
  The Sakju foodstuff factory with a plottage of more than 
24,000 square metres has all its production processes 
streamlined. 
  The local industrial factories in Anju city now produce 
consumer goods of more than 1,420 kinds, or twice as many as 
turned out in South Pyongan Province in the initial period of 
the local industrial development. 
  The local industrial factories throughout the country now 
fully meet the material needs of the population by firmly 
relying upon the raw materials available in local areas. 
  There are more than 42,500 hectares of raw (?materiel 
cultivation) bases across the country, which produce over 8,000 
kinds of consumer goods.

<F P=106> ["Centenary of Kabo Peasant War Marked" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held 
here Monday to commemorate the centenary of the Kabo Peasant War. 
  The Kabo Peasant War was a patriotic and progressive mass 
struggle to liquidate the feudal misrule, secure the right of 
people to existence and defend the national sovereignty from 
foreign aggression. The war was a largest ever armed struggle 
in the modern history of Korea. 
  The historical Kabo peasant war started with the publication 
of a manifesto run through with the patriotic idea of "promoting 
national interests and welfare of the people" and "rejecting the 
West and Japan" by Chon Pong-chun, commander-in-chief of the 
peasant army, on March 21, 1894, and the war raged as an 
anti-feudal struggle, an anti-Japanese national salvation 
struggle stirring up the whole country at that time. 
  The war, however, ended in failure due to the outrageous 
armed intervention of the Japanese aggressors, treacherous acts 
of the reactionary ruling quarters and due to the 
organisational, ideological and tactical limitations of the 
peasant army itself. 
  Kim Sok-hyong, president of the Academy of Social Sciences, 
in his report at the meeting noted that though the Kabo Peasant 
War failed, it dealt a telling blow at the Japanese aggressors 
and the domestic reactionary ruling quarters, gave impetus to 
the bourgeois reform movement in Korea, awakened the people of 
all walks of life to their class consciousness and consciousness 
of national independence and started the modern anti-Japanese 
righteous volunteers' struggle. 
  He said "it was a principal historical summing up of the 
bloody lessons of the Kabo Peasant War that there must be the 
outstanding guidance of a great leader capable of closely 
rallying the popular masses and leading them along the road of 
struggle and victory if they were to sweep away the oppressors 
and reactionary ruling quarters, realise the independence of the 
masses and defend the country's sovereignty with the internal 
forces of the nation. 
  "The national sovereignty which was so ardently hoped for by 
the participants in the peasant war and other people a hundred 
years ago has not yet been realised nation-wide and the South 
Korean people are in the lot of colonial slavery," he said, and 
stressed: 
  "In order to realise the long-cherished desire of the 
nation, 
the anti-national, anti-democracy and anti-reunification Kim 
Yong-sam 'civilian' fascist regime must be wiped out and the 
independence and democratization of the South Korean society be 
achieved". 
  Noting that the struggle against foreign aggression should 
be 
intensified to realise the national sovereignty on a nation-wide 
scale, he condemned the U.S. and Japanese imperialisms as 
inveterate enemies of the Korean people who invaded and have 
plundered Korea from long ago. 
  He stressed that the Koreans in the North and South and 
overseas must firmly unite under the banner of great national 
unity and vigorously struggle to decisively check and frustrate 
the manoeuvres of separatists at home and abroad and achieve 
national reunification in the '90s at any cost. 
  The meeting was attended by Chang Chol, vice-premier of the 
Administration Council, Yu Mi-yong, chairperson of the Central 
Committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party, Yo Yon-Ku, presidium 
member of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the 
Reunification of the Fatherland, other officials concerned and 
men of science, education, culture and art and the press and 
public organisations.

  [Excerpts] Gunhin, alias Kyar Lay, commander of the 203d 
Battalion of the ABSDF [All Burma Students Democratic Front] 
armed organization in the jungle, together with his wife, Ma Yee 
Yee Aye, and a two-year old daughter surrendered at the Myanmar 
[Burmese] Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, and returned to Yangon 
[Rangoon] on 9 March. [passage omitted] 
  Gunhin was involved in the 1988 events and fled to the 
border 
on 5 November 1988. He arrived at the Bodaw camp of the 10th 
Battalion of the Karen armed organization in the jungle via 
Ranong in the country on the other side [Thailand] and later 
joined the ABSDF 203d Battalion formed at the camp. Ma Yee Yee 
Aye is a member of the medical unit of the ABSDF 203d Battalion 
in the Minthamee camp of the KNU [Karen National Union]. 
[passage omitted] 
  Gunhin resigned as commander of the 203d Battalion following 
an argument with the camp administration and later went to 
Bangkok, where he drew a monthly refugee allowance from the [UN] 
High Commission for Refugees and performed odd jobs. He said 
that he decided to return to the legal fold after hearing about 
the developments in Myanmar while in Bangkok and the warm 
welcome and reception accorded by the government to the 
returnees. [passage omitted] 
  The government is still keeping the reception centers open 
and welcoming youths who fled to the country on the other side 
for various reasons following the 1988 events and joined armed 
organizations in the jungles. 
  After hearing the developments in the country and realizing 
the correct view, Hla Tok alias Saw Insolay, platoon commander 
of the 7th DO [expansion not known] Battalion of the Karen armed 
organization in the jungle, surrendered along with one M-16 
assault rifle, two magazines, 90 rounds of ammunition, one M-79 
rocket launcher, and one 40-mm projectile on 2 March at Palau 
garrison. 
  Similarly, Bedar alias Tun Myint, unit commander of the BCP 
[Burma Communist Party]-BTA [expansion unknown] armed 
organization, and two privates -- Myint Htay and Khin Maung Htwe 
-- surrendered along with three M-16, four M-16 magazines, 25 
rounds of ammunition, one BA-64 assault rifle, one BA-64 
magazine, 55 rounds of ammunition, two 40-mm projectiles, and 25 
rounds of carbine ammunition on 4 March at Namsun garrison. 
They were warmly welcomed by the authorities at the garrisons 
concerned.

  [Text] Dear listeners. Soldiers from the SLORC [State Law 
and Order Restoration Council] defense services have the habit 
of forcefully abducting villagers from Shwekyin Township, Pegu 
Division with various reasons, and sometimes none. Some of 
those abducted died in prison, while others have been jailed for 
prolonged periods without any charges. Ko Soe Min will present 
the news as reported by Ko Hnin Wai, a Democratic Voice of Burma 
[DVB] journalist from the Manerplaw Bureau. 
  Dear listeners: On 11 April 1992, Lieutenant Chit Swe Myint 
and group, a SLORC military column, from Regiment 57, forcefully 
arrested U Shar Maung, 57, from Mingalar Village for 
collaborating with insurgents. U Shar Maung was jailed in the 
Shwepyinyein camp in Shwekyin Township and then transferred to 
the jail in Pegu. Although his wife, Daw Daung, had to pay a 
bribe of 20,000 kyat for the release of her husband, U Shar 
Maung died in the Pegu jail on 11 October 1993 because of 
injuries he received during his arrest and lack of food while in 
jail. 
  On 5 November 1992, Company Commander Lt. Myint Zaw and 
group 
from Regiment 349 came and arrested (Tatlulu), 26, son of U 
(Toeyoto) in (Mar Gauk) village -- a red faction Pa-O village -- 
in Shwekyin Township. During the arrest, the soldiers also 
destroyed the (?curry pots) which were meant to be sold to 
woodcutters. (Tatlulu) was jailed in Shwekyin, where he died on 
18 October 1993. 
  On 1 May 1992, woodcutter U Po Pein, 52, from Myetnu 
Village, 
Shwekyin Township, was wrongfully arrested by Deputy Regimental 
Commander Major Hla Nyunt and group from Regiment 350 and he is 
detained in Shwekyin jail till now. Similarly, on 1 May 1992, 
while U Kyaw Myint, 27, from Shansu village, Shwekyin Township, 
was on his way to cut firewood, Company Commander Lt. Thein Win 
and group from Regiment 350 tied him up and took him away, 
accusing him of being a hardcore insurgent. U Kyaw Myint is 
still in the Shwekyin jail today. On that same day, U (Khawtaw 
Ne Oo), 22, from the same village, was taken into custody by a 
group led by Sergeant Sann Myint from Regiment 350, and he is 
believed to be in the Shwekyin jail. Similarly, Ko Kyaw Shwe, 
27, from the village of Shansu, was arrested by Company 
Commander Lt. Thein Win and group from Regiment 350. Villagers 
U Po Pein, U Kyaw Myint, and (Khawtaw Ne Oo) are still in the 
Shwekyin jail. 
  Furthermore, on 1 May 1992, U Saw Thi, 41, (Ko Khin Maung 
Aye), 21, Saw Tharsehmu, 32, and (Kawethe), 28, all villagers 
from Mahawthabin, Shwekyin Township, were abducted by Company 
Commander Lt. Thein Win and group from Regiment 350, and have 
been in the Shwekyin jail ever since.

<F P=106> [Report by Aung Zaw] </F>
  [Text] At noon, the riot police began to enter Rangoon 
University while Burmese army troops surrounded the campus, 
easily crushing the peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations. 
Female students ran to escape arrest, but they were caught by 
police and beaten. As the women began sobbing and crying, the 
situation became like hell. In the evening, about 1,000 students 
were taken to Insein prison. 
  It was March 17, 1988, the beginning of what has become 
known 
as the democracy uprising in Burma. Quickly, Rangoon became a 
ghosttown: Martial law was imposed, as shooting, street 
demonstrations and fighting between riot police and civilians 
continued. 
  On March 18, about 70 people suffocated to death in a prison 
van. In the evening, thousands of people were rounded up and 
thrown into jail yet another hell. Children, mostly Muslims, as 
well as many other civilians were beaten to death in prison. 
  "Fear in Burma is increasing," said a foreign journalist who 
was lucky enough to get a visa to Burma recently. Some 
observers and diplomats have noted lately that it seems that the 
State Law and Order Restoration Council's (SLORC) countrywide 
intimidation campaign has been successful. 
  Even with this grim observation the next few months offer 
many occasions for commemorating the 1988 uprising and the 
important events that followed. While it is a sure bet that 
SLORC will not allow any public display of solidarity, some 
Burmese in Rangoon and other major cities are expecting 
"something to happen", according to a source. 
  An activist in Rangoon recently said, "We are hoping for 
change because we are fed up with SLORC." He said that by 
change he meant, "pressure from outside and inside." Many 
Butmese, indeed, are dreaming about "outside pressure" since 
they realise that they cannot fight the cruel armed forces. In 
particular, many Burmese were expecting the UN or one of the 
superpowers to respond with tough action against the Burmese 
military during the uprising of 1988. 
  Even with attempts to apply pressure by the international 
community the Burmese military is still allowed to terrorise and 
to purge all opponents. Six years after the nationwide street 
demonstrations, killings and violence, Burma is like a dormant 
volcano which can explode anytime. 
  Rangoon resident Hla Htun said "We feel very depressed about 
the current situation but are always encouraged by Daw Suu [Aung 
San Suu Kyi]. What we need is encouragement." He criticised 
SLORC's General Secretary, Lt-Gen Khin Nyunt, for recently 
refusing to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi. Khin Nyunt turned down 
a proposal by U.S. Congressman Bill Richardson to hold a 
dialogue with the detained leader. 
  Another Rangoon resident, Aung Myint, said Khin Nyunt's 
decision had "crushed people's hopes", adding, however, that he 
and others are still hoping that "SLORC may see the light in the 
end. Aung San Suu Kyi is still the strongest leader we have." 
  Though it is not known what the remamlng opposltion groups 
are planning at the SLORC-sponsored National Convention, the 
National League for Democracy (NLD), winner of the 1990 
elections, is still opposed to SLORC's proposal to give the 
armed forces a leading role in the constitution, an inside 
source reported. 
  According to the source, people in Rangoon are not told what 
is happening at the convention, but "some of SLORC's hand-picked 
delegates also feel guilty because they know they are lying like 
SLORC and that the ordinary Burmese do not have faith in the 
convention." 
  While SLORC is forcing delegates to the convention to accept 
what SLORC wants, it has meanwhile been reaching cease-fire 
agreements with the armed ethnic groups that have been fighting 
for autonomy for more than four decades. 
  As these agreements do not really guarantee peace for Burma, 
it may be that SLORC is just testing the waters. The ethnic 
groups are tired of war and are seeking peace, but different 
circumstances among the armed groups have led to these 
cease-fire talks. 
  Some groups, for instance, the Karen and the Mon, are being 
forced to make peace with SLORC through pressure from 
neighbouring countries. Even the peace agreement between the 
Kachin Independence Organisation (KI0) and SLORC, which was 
formally signed in Myitkyina last month, has an uncertain future. 
  At the signing ceremony, which was broadcast by Burmese 
television, Lt Gen Khin Nyunt was still using the term of 
"coming back to the legal fold" in referring to the KIO. This 
certainly did not go down well with some Kachin leaders. Later, 
Maj-Gen Zau Mai, vice-chairman of the KI0, said at the ceremony 
that although both parties were agreeing to sign the cease-fire 
agreement, it would be possible for the KI0 to return to its 
armed struggle if the peace process falls. 
  As it is, the people in the tea shops, markets, pagodas, 
factories, and schools who were active in the prodemocracy 
movement in 1988 and the following years are still waiting for 
true democratic change. These people can become street-fighters 
again at anytime. For this reason, fear is increasing in Burma, 
not only among ordinary people, but also within SLORC itself. 
  According to well-informed sources, Matriculation students 
staged a brief protest against the SLORC after sitting for the 
final exams in mathematics in Rangoon early this month. The 
students dispersed before the authorities arrived, the sources 
said. There were no arrests reported. 
  Burma did have a parliamentary democracy before 1962, and 
there was even a short-lived democracy in August-September 1988, 
but SLORC's leaders considered these only as "disturbances." 
  It does not matter what the medieval Burmese military 
dictatorship thinks about democracy, most Burmese will continue 
to believe that democracy and freedom are essential for Burma. 
  Recently, a U.S. State Department spokesman hinted that the 
Clinton administration may push for an international arms 
embargo against SLORC and may put pressure on SLORC's leaders to 
open a dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi by appointing a special UN 
envoy to Burma. These long overdue moves by the U.S. may be the 
"encouragement" that Hla Htun and so many other Burmese 
desperately need.

  [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas says 
Indonesia's candidacy for a non-permanent seat in the UN 
Security Council [UNSC] will face no obstacles as in previous 
years. Ali Alatas told reporters in Jakarta that there has been 
no opposition to Indonesia's current candidacy. Thus, Indonesia 
is not expected to withdraw its candidacy. There has also been 
no other candidate from the Asian group. He said Indonesia had 
the intention of becoming a UNSC non- permanent member since 
assuming the chairmanship of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] in 
1992, as a NAM chairman is traditionally an UNSC non-permanent 
member for a two-year term. Indonesia failed in its bid in 1992 
because Oman representing the Arab countries asked Indonesia to 
withdraw its candidacy. Oman said it had been prepared for the 
post for a long time. Pakistan, which made its bid for a UNSC 
non-permanent seat, asked Indonesia to reconsider its candidacy 
in 1993. Indonesia is now confident that there will be no 
obstacles in its bid for the 1995-1997 term in 1994.

  [Text] Pati, Central Java (JP) -- Golkar [Functional Group] 
chairman Harmoko has dismissed allegations that there is a 
growing rift between the ruling political organization and the 
Armed Forces (ABRI). 
  "That's not true. Golkar and ABRI have been partners for a 
long time," Harmoko said here on Monday. 
  He said the allegations were made by irresponsible parties 
out to see Golkar lose votes in the 1997 general election. 
  "Golkar and ABRI are in complete cooperation in making our 
national development a tremendous success. It is groundless to 
say that there is a rift between the two," said Harmoko. 
  Harmoko is the first civilian to be appointed to head Golkar 
since the group was founded with the help of the Army in 1964. 
He is currently visiting Pati as part of his current Ramadan 
tour. 
  He expressed optimism that in the 1997 election Golkar will 
regain the votes it lost to the other two contestants, the 
United Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic 
Party (PDI) in 1992. 
  Golkar has won all four elections held under the New Order 
administration. Although the government-backed political 
organization won the 1992 election with a comfortable 68 percent 
of the total votes, this represented a decline from 73 percent 
seen five years earlier. 
  Many within the party have blamed Lieutenant General (ret) 
Wahono, then chairman for Golkar, for the decline in popularity. 
  Wahono was replaced as chairman by Harmoko last October. 
  Harmoko, who is also minister of information in President 
Suharto's cabinet attributed the decline in Golkar votes in the 
1992 election to a lack of information and communications among 
the group's cadres. 
  "But I'm pretty sure that Golkar will not suffer another 
setback in 1997," he said emphatically. 
  He asked all Golkar members to make every effort to maintain 
the organization's image as an agent of reform that responds to 
the wants and needs of the people. 
  "Golkar should be more involved in finding solutions to the 
problems that are facing the people," he added. 
  Harmoko emphasized that there must be better communication 
between Golkar's provincial counselors. He also stressed the 
need for all Golkar cadres to exercise what he cryptically 
referred to as 'social control.' 
  "Every Golkar cadre must do more than support the 
implementation of national development," Harmoko said. "He or 
she must also exercise social control in an effective manner." 
  Central Java was one of the areas where Golkar fared poorly 
in the last general election and Harmoko in his speech blamed 
this specifically on the cadres' for failing to mobilize support. 
  Harmoko also took time to meet with the executives of the 
Nahdlatul Ulama [NU] [Association of Muslim Scholars] in 
Semarang, Central Java, on Monday where he gave a donation of Rp 
[Rupiah] 20 million. The Golkar chairman denied that he was 
using the donation to influence NU votes in Golkar's favor. 
  NU with its estimated 30 million members in Indonesia, 
represents a potential block vote at each of the general 
elections.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- The European Economic Community 
(EEC) has threatened to stop its Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP) facility for all Indonesian exports to its 
member countries if Indonesian car radio assemblers continue to 
violate GSP requirements. 
  Director General of Foreign Trade Joko Muljono yesterday 
said 
that since as early as March 1991, EEC officials have indicated 
that car radio imports from Indonesia had less than 60 percent 
local content and were therefore ineligible to receive the GSP 
facility. 
  However, since Indonesian exporters did not take heed of the 
warning, the EEC sent a fact-finding commission to Indonesia in 
March 1993, which discovered concrete evidence showing that 
several companies had violated the GSP terms," Joko said. 
  "The EEC asked the Indonesian Government to deal firmly with 
the violators and threatened that if the violations were not 
stopped, it would disqualify, not only car radios, but all 
Indonesian products from the GSP facility," he said. 
  Joko said the Indonesian Government is presently handling 
the 
case and the director of foreign trade relations has been 
negotiating with the EEC in Brussels since February 21. 
  "As of March 1993, we found eight companies proven to have 
violated GSP regulations," he said. 
  "We appeal to Indonesian companies to have a higher sense of 
integrity by obeying the agreed regulations because the 
violation of several companies will damage the integrity of all 
other exporters to Europe," he said. 
  Joko said the components used for the car radios exported to 
the EEC were imported from various countries, including Korea 
and Malaysia.

  [Text] Butterworth, March 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia is 
willing to send additional soldiers to serve in the United 
Nations Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina if 
requested to do so by the UN, Chief of Defence Forces General 
Borhan Ahmad said Tuesday. 
  He said, however, there had been no proposal yet to despatch 
extra peacekeepers to the war-ravaged country. 
  So far Malaysia's contribution in UNPROFOR was sufficient 
alongside the participation of soldiers from several other 
countries, he told reporters after launching the 13th air Thamal 
joint exercise between the Malaysian and Thai Air Forces at the 
Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) base here. 
  Malaysia has sent about 1,500 soldiers to join the UN 
peacekeeping force in response to the atrocities committed by 
Serbs on Muslims in Bosnia. 
  Ten RMAF aircraft, including five F-5E jets and three OV-10 
reconnaissance planes, are taking part in the exercise, an 
annual series held on rotation between the two countries to 
strengthen cooperation in operational procedures.

  [Text] Malaysia's foreign minister said he would like to 
see more contacts with Singapore at a younger level. Mr. 
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who is in Singapore on a two-day visit, 
said bilateral relations are good and there is very [as heard] 
contact at the ministers' level. But he said there is a need to 
replace the old schoolboy network forged through the Raffles 
College link. Mr. Abdullah was speaking in an informal dialogue 
session with young PAP [People's Action Party] members. 
  At a news conference this afternoon, Mr. Abdullah said that 
the ASEAN regional forum on security and the need to ensure its 
success was a topic discussed by Singapore leaders. 
  On the growth triangle, the foreign minister said the 
discussions touched on the need to have an easy flow of labor 
among the three countries in the group. Mr. Abdullah said the 
three should maximize their advantages in labor resources on a 
project basis.

<F P=106> [By Patrick Lesco] </F>
  [Text] Phnom Penh, March 21 (AFP) -- Cambodian Government 
forces encountered little resistance Monday as they maintained 
pressure Monday on the Khmer Rouge, holed up in their last 
stronghold of Pailin, government sources said. 
  Spokesman General Pruoch Bunthol said around 250 government 
soldiers had been dispatched as reinforcements to help in what 
he called "mopping up" operations around Pailin, located on the 
Thai border 350 kilometers (210 miles) from Phnom Penh. 
  "About 30" of the rebel faction have been killed since the 
offensive was launched on Friday, he said. One of them was 
executed on Saturday for having refused to reveal where mines 
and traps had been laid, he said. 
  "There is still fighting, but not much," the general, who is 
the headquarters' spokesman, said, adding that he was still 
awaiting a detailed report from the front that would give 
precise casualty figures. 
  Khmer Rouge radio, monitored in Bangkok, also went off the 
air, an apparent sign that the guerrillas had decided to abandon 
the jungle-clad transmission site rather than risk losing its 
equipment to government attacks from the air. 
  But western experts were skeptical about the government's 
ability to maintain position long-term in Pailin, a timber and 
mining centre whose rubies have provided the Khmer Rouge with a 
fat war chest. 
  "The battle for Pailin is far from over," one expert said, 
speaking on condition he was not identified. 
  He drew a parallel with the combat earlier this year for 
Anlung Veng, a Khmer Rouge base in the north of Cambodia, where 
the guerrillas melted away into the jungle in order to avoid a 
pitched battle. 
  Government leaders said at the time they had inflicted a 
major blow on the rebels -- but were then staggered, three weeks 
later, when the Khmer Rouge counter-attacked and routed the 
government troops. 
  The expert noted that "Pailin is in a basin, and the 
government's men do not control either the heights, to the 
north, or access from the south." 
  The heights, 1,000 metres (3,250 feet) high, give a massive 
strategic advantage. If they fell into the guerrillas' hands, 
"that would put the Cambodian troops in an untenable position." 
  In addition, by digging in, the government's forces would be 
increasing their logistical problems, "which are already their 
weak point," the expert said. 
  The spokesman said that between 6,000 and 10,000 troops had 
been deployed in the battle for Pailin, out of the army's total 
complement of 140,000 men. 
  But 60 percent of the armed forces comprises officers, 
leaving a "core" of fighters of only 60,000. The command 
structure is generally considered to be poor. 
  "The Khmer Rouge have a far sharper sense of tactics, and 
it's sure that they haven't said their final word," an expert 
said. 
  Phnom Penh has named the capture of Pailin as a body blow to 
the guerrillas, depriving them of their last bastion, as well as 
vital revenue from ruby mining and timber. 
  The Khmer Rouge became notorious for their four-year tenure 
in power in the 1970s, when they engaged in an orgy of killing, 
slaughtering anyone deemed contrary to their ultra-left, ultra- 
nationalist cause. 
  More than a million were left dead in the so-called "killing 
fields." 
  The guerrillas refused to take part in UN-organised 
elections 
last year, and have maintained armed combat against the 
government that emerged. 
  At least 10,000 people, mainly Khmer Rouge families, have 
fled into Thailand to escape the fighting.

<F P=106> [By Woranant Krongbunying in Koh Kong] </F>
  [Text] The Cambodian government has accepted a plan to 
construct a tourist resort and a casino in Koh Kong province as 
proposed by a group of Thai companies, Koh Kong Province deputy 
governor Pal San said on Saturday. 
  Speaking through an interpreter, San said the project had 
been approved recently but an official announcement had still to 
be made. 
  The project's construction plans are now being reviewed by 
the Cambodian Tourism Office, he said. 
  "Its construction can proceed once the review is completed. 
But it would be left in the hands of the Thai investors to 
decide when to commence construction," San said. 
  The project was initiated by the Wannachai Company. 
  But according to a local source, the project may not 
materialise because Thai investors are now having second 
thoughts about investing in Cambodia because of the Cambodian 
government's recent decision to grant special concessions to 
Singapore Airlines to fly to that country. 
  He said Oran's SK Air, which also has a license to operate 
one of the private airlines to Phnom Penh's Pochentong Airport 
until July this year, was planning to expand its service by 
bringing tourists from the capital city to Koh Kong province. 
  "But this plan is being shelved because the SK Air was 
unable 
to get a license to provide such a service," the source said. 
  San pointed out that as Koh Kong was set to become a tourist 
attraction the provincial authorities would welcome any 
investment projects proposed by foreign companies. 
  The selling point for the tourist, he said, would be the 
natural beauty and surroundings of the place. 
  At present, the most convenient way to travel to Koh Kong is 
by boat which takes around one and a half hours from Thailand's 
Trat province. Road travel is hardly possible due to the poor 
road conditions.

  [Text] New York, March 21 (YONHAP) -- The United Nations 
Security Council on Monday held permanent members' and informal 
general meetings to discuss how to handle the North Korean 
nuclear dispute. 
  The United States presented a draft resolution on the issue 
to the council's other permanent member nations -- Britain, 
France, Russia and China. 
  The draft resolution was relatively moderate, simply urging 
Pyongyang to accept additional inspections by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), sources here said. 
  The 15 members of the council were briefed on a resolution 
by 
the IAEA board of governors and decided to ask Hans Blix, 
director- general of the agency, to verbally report to the 
council this Thursday before he answers questions from council 
members. 
  The IAEA board of governors decided Monday to refer the 
North 
Korean nuclear problem to the Security Council, which is 
empowered to impose sanctions. 
  The Security Council is expected to adopt a resolution early 
next week, according to the sources. 
  The Chinese did not show any reaction to the draft 
resolution 
presented by the United States, saying that the home government 
in Beijing must first be consulted. 
  Since the draft resolution does not impose sanctions on 
North 
Korea but gives it the opportunity to avoid such action, the 
council is likely to adopt it, the sources said. 
  The United States consulted the South Korean mission to the 
United Nations before drawing up the resolution, they noted. 
  The United States decided to draft a rather moderate 
resolution to acknowledge that North Korea had honored at least 
part of an earlier agreement with Washington, an official at the 
South Korean mission said. 
  "It is also designed to give North Korea time to reconsider 
(its decision)," he said. 
  He added, "now is too early to discuss imposing sanctions on 
North Korea." 
  North Korea refused to let IAEA experts conduct full checks 
at all seven declared nuclear sites earlier this month, and the 
IAEA on Monday asked the UN Security Council to intervene in the 
inspection dispute.

  [Text] Seoul, March 22 (YONHAP) -- Seoul demanded Monday 
that Pyongyang fulfill its nuclear safeguards obligations and 
clear up suspicions about its nuclear program, calling attention 
to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) resolution. 
  The South Korean Government noted the March 21 resolution 
adopted by an absolute majority and saw it as a reflection of 
the international community's will, Chang Ki-ho, Foreign 
Ministry spokesman, said in a statement. 
  "It's a reflection of the suspicion and concern of the 
international community regarding North Korea's nuclear 
development caused by North Korea's refusal to fulfill its 
responsibilities and obligations despite global efforts over the 
past year," the statement said. 
  "The government urges that North Korea completely implement 
all its safeguards obligations and clear up global suspicion 
about its nuclear development," it said.

that produce biochemical weapons and storage bases under the 
Ministry of the People's Armed Forces in various places. He 
also exposed that the chemical weapons are the most poisonous in 
the world. 
  He said he heard on several occasions beginning in 1991 from 
high-ranking military cadres and his senior officers that North 
Korea has already completed nuclear weapons development. When 
North Korea was receiving a special [tukpyol] inspection in 
March 1993 from the International Atomic Energy Agency, he said 
he heard from his senior officer that it will be of no use to 
inspect Yongbyon because nuclear weapons are being produced at 
another place.

  [Text] Seoul, March 22 (YONHAP) -- A North Korean Army 
sergeant who defected to the South last week said on Tuesday 
that the People's Army has bio-chemical weapons so toxic that 
they may kill or paralyze the whole 40 million South Korean 
people in the event of war. 
  Sfc. Yi Chung-kuk formerly of a North Korean CBR (chemical, 
biological and radiological warfare) unit told a press 
conference in Seoul that North Korea mass-produced bio-chemical 
weapons developed by the medical school of Kim Il-song 
University and People's Army Medical College. 
  "I heard laboratories tested newly developed bio-chemical 
weapons on living bodies of political prisoners," Yi said. 
  "It was also said that in an area near Chagang Province 
where 
a chemical plant is located, many nearby people suffered serious 
headache and pregnant women gave birth to deformed babies due to 
the leak of toxic substance in June last year." 
  He said high North Korean military officers used to 
encourage 
soldiers by saying that they had nothing to fear because the 
People's Army possesses nuclear arms. 
  Yi said he learned that North Korean officers trained at 
Soviet military academies cannot be promoted to general since a 
coup attempt by those taught at military academies in the former 
USSR was uncovered in October 1992. 
  About his defection, Yi said he left his home in Pyongyang 
on 
last Nov. 9 and smuggled himself to Yanji in northeastern China. 
He could come to South Korea through a third country with the 
help of ethnic Koreans in Yanji, he said. 
  Yi said that in the People's Army he served as a calculator 
at the "counter-nuclear and -atomic analysis center" of nuclear 
and chemical defense bureau of the People's Army General Staff. 
  The duty of the analysis center is to assess a contaminated 
area, wind direction and other data in case CBR weapons are used 
in war and distribute the data obtained to all People's Army 
units, he said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 22 (YONHAP) -- The government and the 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) have agreed to maintain 
global cooperation and pursue a consistent policy toward North 
Korea, with a view to deterring Pyongyang from developing 
nuclear arms and preventing war on the Korean peninsula. 
  The agreement was reached at a high-level party-government 
meeting presided over by DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil on Tuesday 
morning, called to hear the government report on the rupture of 
inter-Korean talks on exchanging special envoys and the threat 
made by North Korea's chief delegate, DLP spokesman Ha Sun-pong 
said. 
  Deputy Prime Minister and National Unification Minister Yi 
Yung- tug said the North was balking to obtain more concessions 
from Washington in future talks and to strengthen its grip on 
the North Korean people in the event of possible U.N. sanctions. 
  North Korea will continue to antagonize the South, while 
laying the blame for the failed inter-Korean talks on Seoul and 
stepping up propaganda against the South Korean Government, he 
predicted. 
  "The government will pursue a North Korea policy aimed at 
co- 
existence and co-prosperity on the basis of harmony between 
international cooperation and national efforts," he said. "The 
door of dialogue remains open but the government is in no hurry 
to resume dialogue." 
  Yi said the basic goal of Seoul's North Korea policy is to 
maintain peace, adding that the government has the power and 
will to do so. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu discussed measures the 
government will take to solve the problem including increased 
pressure on Pyongyang through international cooperation, 
developing management power to prevent the situation from 
abruptly worsening, and establishing a defense system capable of 
responding to any unexpected crisis. 
  The door of dialogue was left open so that North Korea may 
be 
persuaded to give up its isolationist and confrontational policy 
and open up to the world, Han said. 
  Efforts to resume inter-Korean dialogue will be made in 
parallel with an increase in international pressure on 
Pyongyang, he added. 
  He warned that a hard-line policy toward North Korea now 
could stymie international attempts to deal with the communist 
state. 
  Under the basic strategy of preventing war on the Korean 
peninsula and deterring Pyongyang from developing nuclear 
weapons, the government will step up multilateral and bilateral 
cooperation with the United Nations, the United States, China 
and other countries, he said. 
  On U.S.-North Korea talks, Han said dialogue channels 
between 
Washington and Pyongyang must remain open in spite of the 
ruptured inter-Korean dialogue, because such channels are 
essential to North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections and 
in curbing the North's destructive acts. 
  Noting that China is playing a greater role in the U.N. 
Security Council, Han said President Kim Yong-sam would ask 
Beijing to help resolve the problem during his visit there next 
week. 
  He said China's abstention in a vote on a North Korean 
resolution at the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of 
governors meeting on Monday was not unexpected considering its 
policy calling for a solution through dialogue.

<F P=106> [By So Kyo] </F>
  [Text] Following the North Korean delegate's absurd threat 
on the weekend of 19 March that "Seoul will become a sea of fire 
if a war breaks out," the North Korean Army began inciteful 
broadcasts through loudspeakers in the DMZ saying that "South 
Korean armed forces, point your guns backward [kokkuro]." 
Meetings are being one after another at the Chongwadae 
[presidential office] and the White House daily. Foreign and 
domestic news reports sound like a war would break out any time. 
  Surprisingly, however, citizens' responses are rather 
apathetic. With the 9.85-point drop in the composite index when 
the stock market opened at 9:40 AM [0040 GMT, 21 March], people 
said: "So people are shaken as expected." However, the 
predictions of employees at security companies were off the mark 
as stock prices rose shortly thereafter. Consequently, the 
stock market yesterday ended with the usual range of 
fluctuation. The so-called "North- related items," that should 
have obviously plunged if "Seoul is to become a sea of fire," 
showed no particular changes. 
  The same applied to travel agencies who are used to being 
swamped by heightened airline ticket sales and visa inquiries 
whenever North-South relations have gone awry in the past. 
Saying that "nothing has changed," Na Yong-sok, 39-year-old 
sales manager for Global Tours, said "I would rather have our 
business suffer than receive such telephone inquiries in the 
future." There has not been much shopping in bulk either. 
Chong Yong-kil, 37-year-old president of the Kwangmyong Ha-an 
branch of Nongsimga [a supermarket chain], said, "It seems like 
citizens don't see much likelihood of war as they haven't been 
buying in bulk." 
  The college scene is also quiet. Why are the citizens so 
unperturbed? Yi Hyok-chu, chief of the marketing department of 
Lucky Securities Co., assesses that, "It seems that people have 
developed their own sense of the international situation from 
the prolonged negotiations on the North Korean nuclear issue and 
that they are well aware of North Korea's situation." A member 
of Seoul National University's General Student Council 
commented, "The `Seoul sea of fire theory' is merely North 
Korea's gesture to secure an advantageous position in nuclear 
negotiations." 
  Meanwhile, the Ministry of National Defense views this 
phenomenon from two contradictory positions -- that "it reflects 
a maturity in people's views," and that "it reflects that people 
have become desensitized to the security issue."

  [Text] Seoul, March 22 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States held high-level security consultations in Seoul to 
discuss defensive missile deployment and joint military 
maneuvers, officials here said Tuesday. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Ambassador to Seoul 
James Laney led the talks held over breakfast. Gen. Gary Luck, 
chief commander of the UN Forces, and Kim Sam-hun, chief aide to 
Han on nuclear affairs, also attended, officials said. 
  The meeting was arranged just after the International Atomic 
energy agency (IAEA) adopted a resolution referring the North 
Korean issue to the UN Security Council. 
  Inside sources said Seoul and Washington reaffirmed the 
early 
deployment of Patriot missiles, 36 of them sometime next month. 
The two sides, however, held off on a Team Spirit decision 
while agreeing that the drill will be staged when deemed 
necessary, they said. 
  They also discussed what to expect at the UN Security 
Council 
once it takes up the North Korean issue, the possibility and 
effectiveness of sanctions, and Seoul and Washington's readiness 
to counter any North Korean threat, sources said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 22 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said Tuesday that Patriot anti-missile missiles will soon be 
deployed across South Korea in order to strengthen the nation's 
defenses in the face of the worsening North Korean nuclear row. 
  "The defensive weapon, Patriot missiles, will soon arrive in 
Korea," President Kim said. "We have notified (the United 
States) about the deployment of Patriot missiles across South 
Korea." 
  "They will arrive within the shortest time possible, since 
President Clinton has immediately issued an instruction calling 
for an immediate order," Kim added. 
  President Kim disclosed the deployment plan during a 
breakfast meeting with 11 ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) 
postholders including Chairman Kim Chong-pil and Vice Speaker of 
the National Assembly Hwang Nak-chu. 
  "The Patriot missiles and Team Spirit (the joint U.S.-South 
Korean military exercise) are both defensive in nature," said 
Kim. 
  As for the timing of this year's Team Spirit war games, the 
president said he will decide after returning from visits to 
Japan and China next week. 
  South Korea and the United States have already agreed in 
principle to resume the exercise, he noted. 
  "War on the Korean peninsula has to be prevented at any 
cost," the president said. "But we can defend our country only 
when we are strong." 
  The government is mapping out detailed measures to deal with 
any provocation by North Korea, Kim said. 
  North Korea could not make any secret military movements, 
Kim 
said, hinting that a military surveillance system is already in 
place and functioning. 
  Moreover, "the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has 
referred the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security 
Council," Kim said. 
  Members of the council are giving serious consideration to 
the opinion of the country most directly concerned, South Korea, 
he said. 
  Seoul plans to maintain a joint front with Washington and 
close consultations will be held to confront any new 
development, Kim said, adding that he will also have frank talks 
with the leaders of Japan and China during his upcoming visits. 
  "Last Saturday, an unimaginable situation developed at the 
inter- Korean contact," Kim said, referring to the violent and 
aggressive remarks made by the chief North Korean delegate to 
the Panmunjom meeting. 
  The president explained that he convened a meeting of 
security- related ministers Monday to allay the people's fears 
in the wake of the North Korean provocation. 
  "My visits (to Japan and China) are coming at a very 
sensitive time," Kim said. "The main item of concern is the 
North Korean issue." 
  The government is doing its utmost to handle the problem 
domestically as well as internationally by remaining in close 
contact with the United States and other concerned countries, he 
said. 
  North Korea must adapt to the rest of the world, but the 
problem is that its leaders believe change means the collapse of 
their regime, Kim said.

  [Text] It has been learned on 21 March that North Korea 
recently sent a letter to the U.S. Government through channels 
in New York warning that if the United States does not withdraw 
its demands for additional International Atomic Energy Agency 
inspections and the exchange of North and South Korean special 
envoys as the precondition of the third round of the North 
Korea- U.S. talks, North Korea could stop operating various 
surveillance equipment installed in Yongbyon's nuclear 
facilities.

  [Text] On 22 March President Kim Yong-sam discussed 
countermeasures for North Korea's military provocation with top 
military leaders, including Yi Pyong-tae, minister of National 
Defense; Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and 
chiefs of staff of the ROK Army, Navy and Air Force, and decided 
to maintain a posture capable of immediately responding to any 
provocation. 
  Chu Ton-sik, Chongwadae [presidential office] spokesman 
said: 
"The government has established meticulous countermeasures that 
could deter in advance any North Korean provocation and is 
impeccably and fully prepared." 
  Prior to the policy meeting with top military leaders, 
during 
a breakfast meeting with 21 Democratic Liberal Party postholders 
President Kim stressed that there is absolutely no problem in 
military countermeasures, saying: "Our equipment is far 
superior to North Korea's." He explained: "We are not only in 
close coordination with the United States, but also have 
sufficient surveillance and countermeasures with the UN Command." 
  President Kim Yong-sam said: "We have notified the United 
States of the decision to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK and 
they will arrive within the shortest time possible since U.S. 
President Bill Clinton made an immediate order." 
  It has been learned that a reinforced battalion of Patriot 
missiles will be deployed to the ROK with enough fire power to 
gain supremacy over North Korean Air Force capabilities. It 
will take more than one month to deploy them for actual combat 
purposes. 
  President Kim said that "the resumption of the Team Spirit 
exercise has been agreed to in principle" and that the timing 
will be decided after his return from Japan and the PRC. 
  President Kim implied that a perfect early warning system is 
in operation by saying: "North Korea's military moves can never 
be made in secret."

<F P=106> [Article by Ha Chun-u: "Frontline Military Units Assume </F>
Emergency Posture"] 
  [Excerpt] The North Korean delegation said on 19 March 
that "Seoul would be submerged in a sea of fire." These remarks 
have made the South Korean frontline military units become alert 
to North Korea's movements. 
  Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended 
a 
meeting of security-related ministries chaired by President Kim 
Yong-sam on 21 March. In the meeting President Kim Yong-sam 
ordered them to assume a full defensive posture against North 
Korea. Although there is no sign of unusual military movements 
by North Korea along the Military Demarcation Line, including 
its large-scale military mobilization exercise, voices 
denouncing South Korea through loudspeakers have been further 
intensified. 
  According to the military operational plans of each Army 
unit, our officers and soldiers have intensified their awareness 
of North Korea, have continued to conduct battalion-level 
military exercises, and have fully maintained a military 
defensive posture. When President Kim Yong-sam begins his 
foreign trips on 24 March, the South Korean Armed Forces will 
assume the emergency defensive posture as was done in the past. 
Therefore, the South Korean Armed Forces will be more acutely 
strained than ever before. 
  This atmosphere is more clearly disclosed by the holding of 
situational meetings by each Army division on the front line, 
which were held for the first time since the North Korean 
delegation made such provocative remarks. [passage omitted on a 
meeting of division staffs chaired by the division commander]

  [Text] Seoul, March 22 (YONHAP) -- The Joint Chiefs of 
Staff on Tuesday ordered the whole South Korean Armed Forces to 
be on a special alert from March 23 through March 30. 
  During the alert, all major commanders and staff officers 
should stand by within easy access to communications, and leaves 
and outings of all officers and men will be controlled. 
  An officer said the alert is to ensure firmer security 
preparedness as President Kim Yong-sam, the supreme military 
commander, is making an overseas tour at a time when a tension 
is building up on the Korean peninsula following the breakup of 
Panmunjom talks. 
  President Kim leaves the country on March 24 to embark on an 
official visit to Japan, which will be followed by his tour of 
China. 
  "Apart from the special alert, the special military 
preparedness order issued earlier for a period until the end of 
this month, will be extended for the time being," the officer 
said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 22 (YONHAP) -- Seoul hasn't given up 
hope on talking out the nuclear problem with Pyongyang, Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu said Tuesday in the wake of international 
calls for North Korea to permit full nuclear inspections. 
  The odds of solving the problem through dialogue will 
actually get better in the future, Han told reporters. 
  But he made clear that Seoul is ready to act by 
participating 
in U.N. sanctions against North Korea. 
  "Patriot missiles will soon be deployed," Han said, and 
Seoul 
is prepared for the possibility of Pyongyang bolting from the 
nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  While expecting the U.N. Security Council to adopt a 
resolution on North Korea, the foreign minister said trade 
sanctions will gradually become tighter. 
  "But we hope to talk with North Korea even if a resolution 
is 
on the Security Council table. The door is open," said Han. 
  "The whole purpose is to press North Korea to accept nuclear 
inspections and to convince it that dialogue is more to its 
advantage than sanctions," he said. 
  The IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency], the U.N. 
nuclear watchdog, passed a resolution of its own on Tuesday [day 
as received] stating it was unable to verify that North Korea 
had not diverted nuclear material for non-peaceful uses. The 
Agency reported its findings to the U.N. Security Council. 
  China, which voted against a similar IAEA resolution in 
April 
last year, abstained this time. 
  "This was a strong message to North Korea from China," he 
said. 
  Despite pessimism that Beijing, Pyongyang's longstanding 
ally 
whose diplomatic relations with Seoul go back less than two 
years, will not go along with international sanctions against 
North Korea, Han said things are changing. 
  "China no longer insists that its influence over North Korea 
is limited. It used to, but not anymore," he said. "It's also 
true that North Korea and China have grown closer than before, 
and Beijing's role has become enlarged." 
  U.N. sanctions will be mild at the start, making it easier 
for Beijing to tacitly agree. "What will determine China's 
decision is what happens from now, how much effort we put in to 
show that diplomatic efforts have really been exhausted," said 
Han. 
  Seoul's role, in contrast, will diminish as the influence of 
China increases, he predicted. "We have to be prepared for that 
eventuality." 
  The immediate concern is that North Korea might overreact, 
possibly making good on its threat to pull out of the NPT. "We 
need to be prepared for that, too," Han stressed. 
  Asked when Patriot missiles will be deployed in South Korea, 
Han said "very soon," hinting they are due to arrive sometime 
next month. 
  Seoul and Washington have already consulted on when to 
deploy 
the defensive missiles, he said.

<F P=106> ["Dialogue" between Yi So-hang, professor of Foreign Affairs </F>
Security Research Institute, and Kim Kye-tong, Agency for 
Defense Development researcher, on how current North-South 
relations will develop due to the rupture of the North-South 
working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys of the 
North and South -- place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Kim Kye-tong] With the rupture of the 
working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys, the 
remark by the North Korean delegate: "If a war breaks out, 
Seoul will become a sea of fire," is causing waves in our 
society. For North Korea to make such a strong remark proves 
that it does not have confidence at home nor abroad. 
  [Yi So-hang] Such a remark by North Korea is intended to 
create confusion domestically by threatening South Korea by 
saying that "it will be ready for war." Another aspect is that 
North Korea achieved some results on several occasions through 
this "threatening policy," since it announced that it will 
withdraw from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in March 1993. 
  [Kim] If North Korea receives inspection from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and realizes the 
exchange of special envoys even for the sake of formality, the 
road to improve relations will be opened for the possibility of 
holding the third round of talks with the United States. 
Nevertheless, North Korea rejected such measures. I believe 
that this is because North Korea has not yet provided itself 
with a blueprint on opening up. The way to dissolve difficult 
problems, such as an economic crisis and international 
isolation, is through "partial openness" by improving relations 
with the United States. [passage omitted] 
  [Yi] North Korea's strong strategy is an attempt to make its 
nuclear development a fait accompli. North Korea is aware of 
the strategy carried out by India and Pakistan. Threatening 
that "Seoul will become a sea of fire," is intended to 
indirectly reveal that: "We have annihilating weapons." 
  [Kim] The remark by the North Korean delegate, in a 
nutshell, is intended to discontinue dialogue with South Korea. 
As everybody knows, the reason North Korea is saying that it 
will improve relations with the United States is to introduce 
capital and technology from Western countries, including the 
United States, thus providing a breakthrough for its aggravated 
economy. [passage omitted] 
  [Yi] The remark by the North Korean delegate can be regarded 
as part of a Brinkmanship, which North Korea has been promoting 
during the past few years. [passage omitted] 
  [Kim] In connection with the North Korean nuclear issue, I 
believe that a thorough analysis is necessary of how related 
countries, such as the United States and China, regard their 
national interest. [passage omitted] 
  [Yi] The current government's strategy while dealing with 
the North Korean nuclear issue is the appropriate use of the 
"carrot" and "stick." Of course there were some results in 
using this strategy. However, there were also times when we 
emphasized the "carrot" when the "stick" was necessary. That 
is, there were times when we took too much consideration in 
holding dialogue. For example, when the United States tried to 
take strong measures, we put the brakes on the United States by 
sticking too much to the fact that "confusion must be 
prevented." However, we cannot say that our "North Korean 
nuclear diplomacy" has failed. [passage omitted] 
  [Kim] If the IAEA refers the North Korean nuclear issue 
to the UN Security Council after convening a Board of Governors 
meeting, the situation will move toward sanctions against North 
Korea. Then, the issue of economic sanctions will be discussed 
first. However, even though economic sanctions are taken, it 
will take about two to three months before it is put into 
practice. Therefore, how North Korea will react during this 
period is drawing attention. I believe North Korea will take 
strong measures until "right before the deadline for applying 
sanctions" and then, when it becomes clear that sanctions will 
be applied, I believe North Korea will retreat. 
  [Yi] If the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the UN 
Security Council, China's attitude will be a variable. I 
believe that ultimately it will be inevitable for China to take 
part in the sanctions. [passage omitted] 
  [Kim] I am of a different opinion. I believe that it will 
be awkward for China to take part in the sanctions when 
considering North Korea's role as a buffer zone of China and the 
fact that China and North Korea are the few remaining communist 
countries in the world. However, I think that China will 
persuade North Korea so that the situation will not move toward 
taking sanctions. Ultimately, it is expected that right before 
the sanctions take effect, North Korea will retreat. 
  What is an important point in future policy on North Korea 
is 
to develop the passive ROK-U.S. cooperative system into a more 
active and voluntary system. I believe for ROK and the United 
States to share roles in dealing with North Korea will be one of 
the ways to establish an active cooperative system. For 
example, the United States should deal only with North Korea's 
nuclear issue and let the ROK deal with the issue of economic 
assistance to North Korea. Also, the United States should 
clearly inform North Korea of this. Then it will be difficult 
for North Korea to continue to reject South-North dialogue. 
  [Yi] When the stick is definitely prepared, will the 
effectiveness of the carrot be enhanced? We must not completely 
eliminate the carrot, but now is the time to prepare the stick. 
Nevertheless, I believe that we do not need to fundamentally 
regulate our existing policy on North Korea. Our basic task is 
to realize the South-North basic agreement. 
  [Kim] Completely suspending the South-North dialogue at the 
current stage will result in being entangled in North Korea's 
strategy. North Korea may be stimulating the South side aimed 
at such a measure. It may be intended to hold dialogue with the 
United States after rupturing South-North dialogue. 
  Up until now, in North Korean relations, we established the 
nuclear issue as the main variable and economic cooperation as 
the subordinate variable. However, I think that it would be 
good if we switched positions. We must make the issue of 
economic cooperation a more certain weapon. 
  To achieve this, as I said before, the ROK-U.S. cooperative 
system must be further strengthened. Along with this, we must 
clearly show the attitude of "superiority in strength in 
negotiations [himui uwi son hyopsang]." [passage omitted] 
  [Yi] North Korea regards economic cooperation with the South 
side as a "poisonous carrot," which is recognized as a problem. 
As long as North Korea does not change such a thought, it seems 
that economic cooperation will be difficult, whatever attitude 
we take. If we are to change North Korea's attitude, we must all 
the more resolutely establish our negotiating strategy, and 
moreover, we must concentrate on uniting opinions domestically 
and the people must take vigilance. North Korea's violent 
remark, which is like a "declaration of war," at the meeting 
place can be a good incentive in awakening the people's 
vigilance.

<F P=106> [Report on North Koreans fleeing DPRK by crossing into China </F>
to seek asylum--with recorded video footage] 
  [Text] [KBS anchorman Kim Kwang-il] An exodus of North 
Korean residents continues. They are escaping from North Korea, 
individually or in family groups, to take refuge in China. 
Sometimes the number of escapees reaches dozens per day. They 
cross the border suffering from unbearable hunger, and they seek 
freedom. In China, however, they do not find the freedom they 
sought or even a comfortable place to rest. Most of them are 
captured, taken back to North Korea, and executed. Reporter Pak 
Son-kyu of the mobile news coverage department has this report: 
  [Male escapee] I escaped to China about two months ago. 
Hiding in the daytime, I came to an area near the border to 
determine when the guard change took place. I decided that 0630 
would be the most suitable time for my escape and crossed the 
Yalu River by way of Huchang. 
  [Reporter Pak Son-kyu] Desiring freedom and food, they flee, 
risking their lives. The area you see behind me is Tumen in 
Yanbian. Further in the distance is Namyang in North Korea. 
The escapees from North Korea find their way into China via 
border towns like Tumen. The number of escapees living 
scattered in various areas of China is reported to be around 
2,000. In Dalian, a port area, some 800 of them are living in 
hiding. A considerable number of them are living scattered 
about northeastern China in such places as Yanji, Hunchun, and 
Dandong, according to the escapees and the residents of these 
areas. 
  Escapees began coming to China about 10 years ago. Their 
numbers started to increase some three years ago, and beginning 
last October, the influx became even heavier, with 
representation from more walks of life, the residents say. 
  [Unidentified Tumen resident] Many are coming. When the 
Tumen River is frozen, the escapees come in family groups. 
There are senior cadre members among them. 
  [Reporter Pak] How are the escapees living in China? This 
shabby office room on the outskirts of Yanji is where two 
escapees lived in hiding until recently. The owner of this 
office, who gave them a hiding place at the risk of banishment, 
had to put them out recently. 
  [Office owner] I urged them to learn Chinese, but it was not 
easy for them. Therefore, people could easily tell they were 
from North Korea. So they had to leave. If they could stay 
without being noticed by the neighbors, they would not have to 
leave. But since this was not possible, they were restless and 
I was restless. 
  [Reporter Pak] So they had to leave here after all, and no 
one knows their whereabouts. Most of the escapees would prefer 
to seek asylum in the ROK or a third country rather than to live 
in China, which is ready to arrest them and hand them over to 
North Korea, under an agreement with that country, instead of 
protecting them. The escapees seek assistance from the ROK 
Embassy through various channels, but few manage to get help. 
  [Unidentified escapee] When we visited the ROK Embassy, we 
were certain that they would receive us with compatriotic love. 
But the reality was to the contrary. We do not think them cold 
-- they may be bound by some limitations. 
  [Reporter Pak] The reason the ROK Government is not actively 
dealing with this problem is that it wants to avoid adverse 
effects on inter-Korean relations and adverse influences on our 
relations with the Chinese Government. For this reason, the 
escapees have to live in hiding in China. However, under the 
watchful eye of the Chinese public security authorities, they 
find it very difficult to find a place to live in seclusion. 
  The reason for this is that North Korean nationals living in 
China, commonly called chogyo, are making desperate efforts to 
find them. There are some 2,000 chogyo in the Yanbian area 
alone. 
  [Male escapee] There is a chogyo committee in Yanji. There 
are many of them in various places in China. There is one in 
every town, including Heilongjiang. The escapees are arrested 
because of chogyos. Many a poor compatriot was arrested in 
China and taken away because of these chaps. 
  [Reporter Pak] For this reason, the escapees, not knowing 
what to do, are in imminent danger. In this process, many of 
them are arrested and taken away. 
  [Unidentified North Korean residing in China] We have heard 
that many of them have been arrested. 
  [Unidentified witness] I saw a woman being taken away. She 
resisted so hard that most of her hair was pulled from her 
scalp. She said that she would rather die than be taken back to 
North Korea. Although she would be killed in North Korea 
anyway, she would rather die right there in China than in North 
Korea. She was very tough. 
  [Reporter Pak] Because they know how painful it would be to 
be taken away and cruelly executed in North Korea, the escapees 
feel all the more miserable. 
  [Unidentified escapee] This is rat poison. I would much 
rather kill myself than be arrested. 
  [Reporter Pak] Taking advantage of the escapees' urgent 
plight, there are criminal gangs that use them to smuggle goods 
in exchange for providing a hiding place for them. There are 
also impostors who cheat the escapees out of their money. 
  [Unidentified escapee] I can hardly sustain myself in China 
any longer. They cheated me out of 3,500 won. I got this money 
with the help of an ROK man. The impostor cheated me, saying he 
would give me a permit to reside in China. 
  [Reporter Pak] In some port areas, like Dalian, there are 
organizations that let escapees board ocean-going vessels to 
travel overseas. For this, they charge 10,000 Chinese yuan, 
about 1 million ROK won. 
  Some Chinese residents and Korean residents in China extend 
a 
helping hand to them out of compassion, but the risk is too 
great for them to do so as much as they wish. 
  [Reporter Pak] I am now standing on the Tumen River which 
forms the border between China and North Korea. As you see, the 
entire river is frozen hard. Only 20 percent of those who 
attempt to escape succeed. The remaining 80 percent are 
captured and executed, the escapees testify. Some 2,000 
escapees will have to live in endless, cautious seclusion even 
if they cross the border. And others are waiting for an 
opportunity, which may or may not come, to cross the border for 
freedom and food. Will there be no humanitarian measures to 
relieve them of their pain? Pak Son-kyu, KBS-1, from China.

<F P=106> [Report on statements by North Korean escapees living in </F>
China about economic difficulties in North Korea--with recorded 
video footage] 
  [Excerpt] North Korean residents who risked their lives by 
escaping North Korea by crossing the border say they could no 
longer bear the hunger. A Korean Chinese resident who often 
visits North Korea said that the situation in North Korea is 
very miserable. Correspondent Yi Tong-sik reports why North 
Korean residents are leaving North Korea one after another. 
  [Yi Tong-sik] The situation in North Korea as told by the 
North Korean escapees is really hard to believe. In Tumen in 
Jilin Province, across the Tumen River from Namyang, North 
Korea, women entering North Korea from the yard in front of the 
customs office are loading their shabby-looking packages onto 
carts. What are these? 
  [First unidentified speaker] They are things like bags. Do 
not take pictures. 
  [Second unidentified speaker] Take care. 
  [Unidentified woman] I will let you pass it on to you after 
I have seen the leader [suryongnim]. [sentence as heard] 
  [Yi] For those who visit North Korea to see their relatives, 
the most important thing is to carry these packages, large and 
small. The packages contain old clothes, vegetables, and beans, 
but these are precious gifts for the North Korean residents. 
Most of the escapees from North Korea give the very serious 
North Korean food shortage as the reason for their escape. 
  [Unidentified male escapee, age 52] The North Korean 
authorities do not permit edible food to be imported. 
Therefore, they have to import animal feed, such as ears of 
corn. They are going hungry because there is no time to process 
it to make it more suitable for man to eat. They give us crude 
corn with the husk in bags, telling us among whom we must divide 
them. 
  [Unidentified male escapee, age 20] When I was working in a 
coal mine while I was serving in the Army, I collapsed from 
hunger while I was tunneling. My mother was arrested on 21 
April 1987 because she said it is as hard to live at present as 
it was in the days under Japanese domination. 
  [Yi] This difficult situation of North Korea is more vividly 
told by the Korean residents in Yanbian, who often visit North 
Korea. 
  [Unidentified Korean resident in Yanbian] Barley was the 
last thing I wanted to eat there. They gave me meals made from 
corn without the husk. They do not throw away the husks. They 
make cake out of the husks. Here the husks are eaten by swine, 
but in North Korea people cannot fill their stomachs. 
  [Yi] Do they eat rice? 
  [Korean resident in Yanbian] No, they cannot afford it. 
They cannot even afford to eat refined corn. 
  [Unidentified Korean resident in China of North Korean 
nationality] If I go to North Korea, they welcome me for coming 
from another country. They have difficulty in providing the 
guest with food. It is a pity for them. When I go there, I 
feel guilty because I feel I enjoy too much comfort compared 
with them. 
  [Yi] The seriousness of the North Korean economic difficulty 
is seen not only in food shortage, but in electricity shortage 
as well. 
  [Unidentified escapee] Although a worker's monthly wage is 
170 won, he can work only three to four hours because the plant 
cannot operate fully due to the shortage of raw material and 
shortage of electricity. This means the wage one actually gets 
is 30 to 40 won a month. 
  [Unidentified Korean resident in Yanbian] It is a real pity. 
Many have to do without socks to wear. Most children go 
barefoot because they cannot afford to wear shoes. Their feet 
look like duck feet from malnutrition. 
  [Yi] Is there any other reason, except for the starvation 
and economic difficulty, for them to risk their lives by 
escaping? 
  [Unidentified escapee] If they could hope for a better 
future, they would be patient and wait a few more years. There 
is no hope in the North. Unless a fundamental change is brought 
about in the North Korean system, there is no hope for any 
improvement in the livelihood of the 20 million people there. 
  [Yi] No matter how difficult the situation in North Korea 
is, crossing the border is a life-risking adventure for those 
who attempt to flee. [passage omitted on material covered by 
ref]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will not accompany 
President Kim Yong-sam on his forthcoming visit to Tokyo this 
weekend in order to handle the North Korean nuclear matter at 
home, an official said yesterday. 
  The minister will, however, join the President during his 
Beijing trip scheduled for early next week, he said. 
  The official said Han Sunday suggested that he would rather 
stay in Seoul this weekend, which may be a critical point in the 
future development of the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  He said the international community is expected to move 
toward taking some kind of measures against North Korea this 
week, The U.N. Security Council may convene to hear reports from 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the results of 
its recent inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities. 
  The official said Minister Han might have felt that it would 
be more convenient for him to hold consultations at home with 
the United States and other countries on their joint strategy to 
persuade Beijing to join international measures against North 
Korea prior to his China visit next week.

  [Text] The American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Seoul 
is calling on Korea to raise the foreign stock ownership 
ceiling, currently set at 10 percent for each issue, and to end 
the practice requiring foreign investors to get identification 
cards (IDs) in order to invest in the stock market. 
  It is the first time that American brokers here officially 
urge Korea to expand the foreign stock ownership ceiling. 
  Furthermore, AmCham says Korea no longer needs to require 
foreign investors to get ID cards as it has already implemented 
the real-name financial transaction system. Furthermore, it 
said the ID card requirement is "costly" for international 
investors. 
  It is also urging Seoul to introduce the "independent' 
insurance brokerage system and speed up the pace of the 
pre-announced schedule for the liberalization and opening of the 
cross-border and reinsurance markets. 
  AmCham also is proposing that Korea give foreign insurance 
companies operating here greater freedom to develop creative and 
tailor-made policies and diversify premiums, adding that Korea 
maintains a "sameness" in its insurance market. 
  An American insurer said, "Korea's Ministry of Finance has 
implemented many changes since last year but we want to see the 
(liberalization) pace quicker." He said change is coming and it 
is good but the pace is slower than I anticipated. 
  Amcham Korea will send its "draft" paper, which is made up 
of 
the wish lists of American businessmen and financiers here, to 
the Korean government, including the Economic Planning Board, 
next week for comment. It will formally publish the position 
paper early next month following discussion with the AmCham head 
office in Washington, sources said. 
  The AmCham draft report also trains proposals from U.S. 
bankers here who "want to see the expansion of their funding 
sources, elimination of the remaining barriers in the 
development of risk-management derivatives products such as 
swaps, options, and futures as well as combinations of these 
instruments." 
  It also indicated that foreign bankers want to be freed from 
their obligation to limit credit extension to five or ten major 
Korean conglomerates and the mandatory lending ratio for small- 
and medium-sized companies. An American banker here said, "All 
of our recommendations are "old issues," adding that "Our wish 
list becomes thinner and thinner as Korea has made significant 
progress in liberalizing the financial market in recent years." 
  AmCham also expressed the hope that Korea free foreign 
enterprises and joint venture companies from paying taxes on 
what Korea calls excessive retained earnings so that they can 
recycle much of their earnings into investing and expanding 
their operations here. 
  Early this year, the Ministry of Finance lowered the 
so-called excessive earnings tax rate to 15 percent from 25 
percent, following a strong request from Washington. 
  The AmCham report contains the hope of American businessmen 
that Seoul will implement its foreign direct investment 
promotion policy in a packaged, comprehensive and quick manner, 
rather than in a gradual and piece-meal way, sources said.

  [Text] Korea failed to get its country schedule of tariff 
concessions in the farming sector endorsed in the second round 
of verification at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) in Geneva Sunday, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry 
and Fisheries said yesterday. 
  With the failure, Korea has no choice but to revise part of 
its agricultural country schedule if ongoing bilateral 
negotiations with the United States and other interested parties 
fail to reach a settlement. 
  At the second verification, the ministry said, the United 
States and other countries took issue with Seoul's plan to keep 
tariff rates on farming imports at higher levels than it offered 
in the country schedule submitted to GATT in April 1992. 
  They also raised objections to the number of farm products 
which are subject to Seoul's import markups through state 
trading enterprises. 
  Under the country schedule, Seoul seeks to slap import 
markups on 118 agricultural products, compared with 10-odd items 
contained in the previous country schedule. 
  The other nations also expressed dissatisfaction with 
Seoul's 
plan to impose specific tariffs on 97 farm imports, at levels 
higher than those in the previous schedule in April 1992 when 
Korea included the ad valorem tariffs, according to the ministry. 
  Of 48 countries which underwent the second round of 
verification Sunday, about 20, including the United States, the 
European Union, Switzerland, Indonesia, Sweden, Malaysia, Israel 
and Korea, failed to get their country schedules endorsed. 
  The GATT secretariat is asking the countries which had their 
schedules rejected to settle their disputes through bilateral 
negotiations and then inform GATT of the results by Monday night. 
  The Korean Government, in a move to help settle the farming 
issues, dispatched Pak Sang-su, first assistant agriculture 
minister, to Geneva yesterday. 
  Korea has been conducting bilateral negotiations with the 
United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada on farming 
issues since Friday, according to the ministry.

<F P=106> [By staff reporters Kim Chang-yong and Yi Chang-sop] </F>
  [Text] At a kindergarten southwest of the Han River, kids 
are taught not to buy "bad" foreign goods. A nearby elementary 
school advises students against wearing "alien" bags and clothes. 
  These "indoctrinated" children complain when their parents 
casually buy goods bearing foreign brands. Even from childhood, 
Korean children are blindly taught to buy only Korean goods and 
shun alien goods rather than being trained to compare them for 
quality. 
  In the eyes of foreigners, the episode symbolizes how hollow 
President Kim Yong-sam's internationalization drive is. The 
Economic Planning Board [EPB] said in its bulletin that 
internationalization is not a "zero sum game" but a "positive 
sum game." It is also a process of "give and take." But in 
Korea, internationalization still seems to mean "to take much 
and give less." 
  Many foreign businessmen are skeptical about Korea's 
much-touted internationalization campaign and believe there are 
a host of ingrained anti-internationalization practices. 
  For example, it is legal for foreign religious organizations 
to donate whatever amount of money to their Korean counterparts 
to build churches or finance missionary activities here. But it 
is illegal for a Korean religious organization to send overseas 
more than 5,000 dollars without authorization from the 
authorities. 
  Ford has an equity stake in Kia Motors but Ford faces 
difficulty in selling its cars through Kia sales outlets in 
Korea. Consequently, Kia is unable to sell its cars through the 
Ford network in the United States and thus has to spend a huge 
amount of money in establishing its sales network in America. 
  Many Western businessmen said transforming Korea's 
producer-oriented economy into a consumer-oriented one is one of 
the essential tasks Korea must tackle if it is really dedicated 
to internationalizing the economy and its society. 
  Any talk of importing foreign agricultural produce raises 
emotions here and invites noisy opposition from farmers and 
politicians for that matter. But Korea's economy loses more 
than it gains just because of the import ban on farming 
products, they say. 
  According to the EPB, consumer prices rose by 2.4 percent 
from January through February. More than 50 percent of the rise 
is attributable to an increase in agricultural products and 
service charges, it said. 
  The solution to arresting inflation is quite simple: The 
imports of cheap foreign farming products. Nonetheless, the 
government has been hesitating to take action out of concern not 
to antagonize farmers, who account for less than 15 percent of 
the population. The government has used other tools, squeezing 
money supply, which has the chain effect of raising interest 
rates, depressing the stock market and stifling manufacturing 
investment. In addition, the government mobilizes tax officials 
to conduct an audit of businesses not following the 
anti-inflation campaign. 
  Om Pong-song, advisor to the finance minister, said the 
government needs to be more internationalized in managing 
inflation as the old-style method of curbing money growth puts a 
strain on the overall sector. 
  Korean consumer electronics goods are more than two times as 
expensive as foreign goods of the same quality. The wide price 
gap is due to the government's high tariffs on imports. 
  Even when imports are allowed, prices of foreign goods shoot 
up due to lack of efficient distribution channels, expensive 
office rental fees, high wages and bureaucratic red tape. 
  As Korean manufacturers are not exposed to hectic 
competition 
with foreign brands in the domestic market, they have a tough 
time in competing with foreign rivals outside Korea. 
  In the area of technology, the government had tightly 
controlled the imports of foreign knowhow. So, Korean makers 
could not freely buy much foreign technology which would improve 
their product quality as the government scrutinized prices and 
contents of technology inducement contracts. 
  A Western diplomat complained that Korea keeps tight grip on 
the opening of the distribution market out of concern not to 
damage "unclean and expensive" small-size sundry shops. 
  But if foreign retailers open shops and clean their floors, 
he said, Korean sundry shops will also clean their floors and 
lower prices to compete with their foreign rivals. This is also 
good for Korean consumers, he said. 
  The problem does not end here as far as foreign investment 
is 
concerned. As the United States submitted to the Korean 
government a list of industrial sectors, including cable TV 
equipment that American businessmen have shown a great interest 
in investing here, the local media interpreted this as an 
"intolerable U.S. pressure." The U.S. action was in response to 
the Korean government seeking to attract foreign direct 
investment, an embassy official noted. 
  A U.S. State Department official said while on a visit here, 
"Whenever I read translated versions of Korean language dailies 
about Korea-U.S. trade issues, I never fail to notice such words 
"U.S. pressure, American threat, demand, meddle in internal 
sovereign affairs." 
  Whatever foreigners talk or propose, it is regarded as a 
"demand, threat, or pressure," which blurs the true meaning of 
the agenda, he complained. 
  As Korea has such a xenophobic attitude toward foreign 
direct 
investment, multinational enterprises shun investing in Korea 
and instead team up with other "hospitable" Asian countries and 
move to third countries for profitable business expansion. It 
is Korea and its companies that lose most due to foreign 
hesitancy in initiating ventures here, a Western journalist here 
said. 
  Yi Chong-ku, a director at the Ministry of Finance, said, 
"By 
internationalization, we mean internationalization of the 
industry, system and practices and people." 
  In his view, Korea had made significant progress in 
internationalizing industry and its practices and system, but it 
may take time for the Korean people to become internationalized. 
  The EPB said that the government alone cannot 
internationalize Korea. It requires joint efforts by the 
government, private companies, farmers, consumer goods and grass 
roots people. 
  It is the people, not the system or industry, that will 
internationalize Korea, a Western diplomat said. Thus unless 
the Korean people change their narrow-minded, mercantilistic and 
xenophobic attitudes, Korea cannot be truly categorized as an 
internationalized country, a Seoul professor said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 21 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul district 
prosecutor's office, which is investigating the Dec. 12 "coup 
d'etat-like" incident, plans to summon Rep. Ho Sam-su 
(Democratic Liberal Party) this week and question 33 others 
accused of involvement in the coup, prosecution officials said 
on Monday. 
  The prosecution will ask Ho why and how he put then-Army 
Chief of Staff Chong Sung-hwa under the custody of the Defense 
Security Command and call in other former senior military 
officers who took part in the apprehension. 
  The accused include U Kyong-yun, then-chief of the Criminal 
Investigation Detachment (CID), Song Hwan-ok, then-provost 
marshal general office's planning division chief, Choe Sok-nip, 
then-33 [as received] provost marshal and Yi Chong-min, 
then-provost marshal of the Army headquarters. 
  A group of Army officers led by Gen. Chon Tu-hwan allegedly 
mutinied and took control of the Army on Dec. 12, 1979 amid 
political uncertainties following the assassination of President 
Pak Chong-hui on Oct. 26, 1979. 
  The group apprehended Gen. Chong Sung-hwa, Army chief of 
staff and martial law commander, alleging that he had been 
involved in the president's murder. 
  After the inauguration of the civilian government of 
President Kim Yong-sam in February last year, Chong and 22 
others filed suit in July against Chon and 34 others on charges 
of treason, which is punishable by death.

<F P=106> ["Weekly Stock Analysis" by Paek Man-in, analyst at Dongsuh </F>
Securities Co.: "News on N.K. Nukes Likely To Further Dampen 
Market"] 
  [Text] The week started off brightly, as investment 
psychology momentarily perked up on account of (1) customer 
deposits on the rise, (2) trading volume restored to a 
respectable level, (3) advancers dwarfing decliners and (4) 
stabilized interest rates. 
  Financial stocks took the spotlight Monday, led by the 4.27 
percent boom in the banking corner, as the Korea Stock Price 
Index (KOSPI) marched 9.45 points higher to 912.83. 
  Asset plays, which looked promising for the week, lost their 
steam quite early. The Seoul bourse retreated during the next 
four sessions as the persistent unloading of blue-chip stocks 
took a toll on the market. Participation did pick up, however, 
as many investors came off the sidelines; their buying patterns 
were very discriminatory, favoring stock with individual merits. 
  No theme was able to clearly sustain momentum, such was the 
case for the volatile banking sector. The composite index had 
settled well below the 900 point-floor to 893.07 by Friday's 
closing bell. A very mild technical rebound, at best, was 
witnessed on Saturday's half-day session as the market nudged up 
0.92 percent. 
  The long-winded bearish run has been clearly burdened by the 
delay in lifting the foreign holdings limit, while effects from 
the government's market-cooling measures introduced Feb. 2 
continue to dampen sentiments. 
  Furthermore, as a large number of stock will be injected 
into 
the stock market through capital increase, the supply side will 
be beefed-up. Should the demand for Korean equities fail to 
respond correspondingly to such a rise, equilibrium prices will 
fall. Institutions, particularly those with fiscal years ending 
in March, are likely to be quite conservative during this week. 
  Holding a rather risk-aversive stance, they will shun from 
disrupting their 1993 performance. Also, as the end of the 
month approaches, many firms are allocating funds for dividend 
payments and corporate taxes in addition to capital setting 
aside for brisk facility investments, leaving little left for 
direct investment in the stock market. 
  Hence, the market may remain featureless over the week, as 
no 
themes are expected to be highlighted. 
  On the positive side, client deposits are indeed rising 
along 
with healthy transaction volumes of late. The President's 
upcoming China visit may very well bear some fruit for the 
Korean equities market. 
  The Ministry of Finance has just announced that trust funds 
will be permitted to raise capital, as the case for specific 
funds for foreign-investment only, also the foreign ceiling, is 
to be gradually lifted from the second half. 
  Nevertheless, we foresee a continuation of bearish 
conditions 
for the week. The KOSPI should fluctuate near the 900 level, 
led by the exertions of individual investors. News of 
heightened tension with the North will weigh the market down for 
a short while. 
  Despite further consolidation, low- and medium-priced stocks 
are expected to draw buy orders in the earlier part of the week 
as A/D ratios exceed 1.0. 
  However by the week's end, we may very well see interests 
return to blue-chip counters, which have fallen by a big margin. 
Our recommendations for the week are Jinro Ltd., Pohang Iron 
&amp; 
Steel Co. and Kumho Co.

  [Text] The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC), designed to prevent the greenhouse effect which 
causes global warming, formally went into effect yesterday. 
  Since virtually all types of industrial and other commercial 
fuel give off carbon gases, South Korea stands to be hit hard by 
the convention, especially with the massive number of cars and 
conventional heating systems. 
  The convention, which currently has 51 signatory countries, 
is aimed at curbing the emission of carbon dioxide and other 
greenhouse gases on a gradual basis throughout the world. 
  South Korea became a signatory to the convention last 
December as the 46th country to do so and the convention, should 
it in the near future be regarded as an advanced country, could 
pose as a serious problem. 
  According to officials of the Foreign Ministry's Science 
Environment Section, the main cause of global warming has been 
identified as carbon dioxide and the convention reflects 
advanced countries' eagerness to halt further change in the 
climate, especially in terms of temperature. 
  However, there has already been sharp criticism from 
developing countries on pressure for them to join up since they 
believe that most of the greenhouse effects have been caused by 
advanced countries themselves. 
  "Although it is difficult to determine who is actually 
responsible for the changes in climate resulting from pollution, 
chances are that they began long before industrialization 
actually began to take place in countries which are currently 
classified as developing, including Korea," one official noted. 
  Developing countries realize that the emission of carbon 
dioxide and other greenhouse gases is inevitable in the process 
of further industrialization and they have been demanding 
differential treatment. 
  For Korea, however, the problem is not so simple. It is 
scheduled to apply for admission to the OECD (Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and development) in 1996 and it would have 
to express greater willingness to conform to the standards in 
advanced countries. 
  Statistically, the per capita emission of carbon dioxide was 
measured at about 1.6 tons in 1990, considerably less than the 
2.4 tons in Japan and 5.8 tons in the United States. 
  Since the convention stipulates that countries in group one, 
in which Korea is not yet included, must reduce the level of 
emission to that in 1990 by the year 2000, which would be an 
enormous task for the government and industry. 
  The non-law-binding convention seeks to establish the basic 
guidelines for the reduction of greenhouse gases and deal with 
problems relating to the provision of financial and 
technological assistance to developing countries. 
  Advanced signatory countries are obliged to obtain an exact 
estimate the existing emission volume of the pertinent gases and 
report it to the convention's negotiating committee along with 
specific timetable for their reduction. 
  Developing countries, on the other hand, have a period of 
three years to do the same although they have been insisting 
that their timetable would depend on the extent of financial and 
technological assistance from advanced countries.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A New Milestone in the History of Lao-Cambodian </F>
Relations"] 
  [Text] At the invitation of His Excellency [H.E.] Saman 
Vi-gnaket, chairman of the National Assembly [NA] of the Lao 
People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], Samdech Chea Sim, chairman 
of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and his 
delegation paid an official friendship visit to our country from 
5 to 7 March. 
  During their stay in Laos, Samdech Chea Sim and the 
delegation paid courtesy calls on H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan and 
H.E. Khamtai Siphandon, respectively president and prime 
minister of the LPDR. The party also laid a wreath at the 
Monument of Unknown Combatants and visited many places of 
economic and cultural significance in Vientiane Municipality and 
Vientiane Province. 
  An official meeting was held to exchange views on the 
situation of the two National Assemblies at the National 
Assembly Hall in an atmosphere of friendship, sincerity, and 
mutual understanding. The two sides expressed satisfaction with 
the time-honored traditional fine relations of friendship 
between Laos and Cambodia -- two adjacent countries which have 
developed close ties of good neighborliness and multifaceted 
cooperation in coordinating and improving the methods of 
cooperation to become more efficient for their common and 
unilateral interests in the immediate and long-term future. 
  An indication of such goodwill and friendship has been 
displayed in the recent exchange of visits by the high-level 
delegations headed by the prime ministers of the two countries,

<F P=106> [Editorial from 22 March PASASON: "Pay Attention to </F>
Building the Party as Political Task in the New Stage"] 
  [Text] Beloved listeners: Today, 22 March 1994, marks the 
39th founding anniversary of the noble, glorious Lao People's 
Revolutionary Party [LPRP]. We celebrate this occasion at a 
time when our entire party, army, and people have won new 
achievements in many fields and translated into reality the 
resolution of the fifth party congress in the cause of national 
defense and construction. Cadres, party members, and multiethnic 
people of Laos wholeheartedly welcome the founding anniversary 
of the party. On this occasion, we also would like to express 
our grief and mourning for the late Comrade Kaysone Phomvihan, 
former chairman of the party Central Committee, and other 
comrade leaders as well as other outstanding party members who 
have left us forever. 
  The LPRP was founded 39 years ago. Its founding marked a 
milestone of development in the significant turning point of the 
Lao revolution. The important responsibility of the party was 
to lead the entire Lao people to struggle for the independence, 
prosperity, and strength of the nation and for the freedom and 
happiness of our multiethnic Lao people. Throughout the past, 
the LPRP has shouldered the great responsibility and 
successfully led the entire people to fulfill the 
national-democratic revolution, defend the country, and build 
the new system. 
  Since its fourth and the fifth congresses, our party has 
pursued a new, comprehensive, and profound restructuring line. 
The line pursues restructuring in viewpoints to restructuring 
in the economic field, thus doing away with the state-financing 
administrative system and switching to the accountability 
mechanism, implementing the policy of multifaceted economic 
structure, broadening the relations with foreign countries, and 
turning the natural economy into the goods-oriented economy. 
The aforesaid restructuring line has reflected our party's 
talented, clear-sighted leadership and quickness. It has 
conformed to the overall trend and situation of the world. It 
has also benefited our country's revolutionary development. The 
restructuring line has, therefore, brought about an improvement 
of the general situation in our country. Following the 
implementation of the line, our economy has been increasingly 
developed while our people's material and cultural life has been 
significantly improved, the political stability has become 
secure and firm and it will serve as a strong basis for the 
national development in the subsequent years, and the people's 
democratic rights and rights to being owners of the country have 
been further promoted and expanded, as a result of which our 
country has worthily contributed to establishing world peace and 
maintaining friendship and cooperation with various countries. 
Our country has then gained sympathy, support, and assistance 
from various countries and international organizations for our 
cause of national construction and development. 
  Our party has achieved success in fulfilling heavy 
responsibilities as entrusted to us by the nation and people 
because it has consistently adhered to the class and 
revolutionary attitudes and has struggled for the independence, 
prosperity, and strength of the country and for freedom and 
happiness of the people. Our party has always paid attention to 
improving itself on the basis of its strategic principle and 
objective. It has adjusted and perfected its direction to be in 
conformity with the situation in each stage. Our party has 
always maintained unique solidarity and strictly implemented 
democratic centralization while opposing privatism and 
opportunism. It has always followed the path of masses, closely 
associated with the masses, and worked in coordination with the 
people for the interests of the people. It has always combined 
genuine patriotism with pure internationalism. 
  The fruitful success of the party's leadership has been 
related to the achievements won in carrying out the party 
building work and ideological training work, the training and 
tempering of cadres and party members, the party's restructuring 
line, and the profound patriotic spirit and spirit of cherishing 
the new system of the multiethnic Lao people. The cadres and 
party members, as well as the multiethnic people, are very 
elated and proud over the success of the party's leadership. On 
this occasion, we, cadres and party members, would like to 
express our gratitude to the party and our confidence in the 
party's leadership. We also express our support for the new, 
restructuring policy, rules, and regulations of the party. We 
pledge to positively contribute to the party's cause of 
defending and building the country. 
  On the occasion of the party's 39th anniversary, let all our 
cadres and party members continue to study and learn the said 
fine traditions of the party and be determined to adhere to the 
party's lofty ideals through actual acts of enhancing the 
solidarity to ensure the unified and leading characteristics. 
In the immediate future, let us speed up consolidating, 
building, and strengthening foundations for party units and 
fulfill the leadership role in all respects in order to realize 
the party's objective in each stage. Let us also implement the 
party's restructuring line in an appropriate manner in order to 
achieve success in implementing our country's socioeconomic 
development plan for the period from now to year 20000.

<F P=106> [By Philippe Agret] </F>
  [Text] Hanoi, March 20 (AFP) -- Vietnamese authorities, 
signalling that they do not intend to let the lifting of the US 
economic embargo threaten political stability, have arrested a 
leading dissident, Vietnamese sources said Sunday. 
  Nguyen Ho, one of the most prominent internal opponents of 
Vietnam's communist regime, was re-arrested early this month at 
his home in Ho Chi Minh City, sources in the southern city said. 
Ho -- a former Viet Cong guerrilla, trade union leader and 
party figure -- had penned and circulated an article calling for 
greater democracy and respect for human rights in Vietnam, 
according to the US-based human rights group Asia Watch. 
  Ho, who is in his 70s, was held under house arrest from 
September 1990 to May 1993 after trying to form a veterans' 
association independent of the Communist Party. A number of 
other members of the organization were also arrested this month 
in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, said the sources, who did 
not provide their names. 
  In Hanoi, the Foreign Ministry could supply no information 
on 
Ho, who is reportedly in poor health. But a source close to the 
communist leadership acknowledged that Hanoi had decided to 
tighten the screws on dissent to prevent any destabilizing 
effects from the lifting of the US embargo, expected to increase 
foreign influence as well as investment in Vietnam. "There is a 
real risk," the source said. "Socialism in the Soviet Union 
crumbled under the combined effect of foreign pressure and the 
breakdown of the domestic system." 
  Since the embargo was scrapped in February, the official 
press has stepped up its warnings against "peaceful evolution" 
-- a Cold War term for the subversion of communist regimes 
through economic and social change. 
  Vietnamese authorities insist on the need for political 
stability to complete their program of "doi moi," or economic 
renovation. They have confronted internal dissent -- whether it 
be religious (Catholic or Buddhist) or political -- while 
rejecting "external interference" in the country's affairs. 
They are highly suspicious of overseas Vietnamese, particularly 
those from the million-strong exile community in the United 
States, made up largely of families who fled Saigon after the 
1975 communist victory. 
  But Vietnam, which keenly needs their expertise as well as 
their capital to develop its fledgling market economy, is 
looking for ways to lure the "Viet Kieu" back while minimizing 
the risks. "Ninety percent of the Viet Kieu are patriots who 
left for economic reasons," said an unofficial government 
spokesman. "But the others, with links to the old American 
(client) regime, want to return to make contact with 
anti-socialist forces, especially reactionary Buddhists and 
Catholics. 
  Perhaps the most serious threat to the government comes not 
from those who were on the losing side of the war but from some 
of the winners -- disgruntled former communist guerrillas, 
soldiers or party cadres, generally southerners. 
  Figures such as Ho, former General Tran Van Tra or former 
Politburo member Tran Xuan Bach have shown varying degrees of 
opposition to democratic centralism with its refusal of 
political pluralism and limits on human rights. The secret 
police are keeping several dozen such revolutionary veterans 
under strict surveillance, Vietnamese sources said, suggesting 
that purges were recently carried out within the party and state 
apparatus. 
  But it would be difficult to prosecute or jail men with such 
illustrious revolutionary credentials, said a veteran who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. "We're not dogmatic. Political 
renovation will follow economic renovation. But we will never 
accept Western-style multiparty politics," said the source, who 
is close to the leadership.

  [Text] The National Assembly Standing Committee on 19 March 
issued the following communique: 
  The National Assembly Standing Committee held a meeting from 
7 to 16 March under the chairmanship of National Assembly 
Chairman Nong Duc Manh. 
  1. After hearing a government representative deliver a 
report and representatives of relevant National Assembly 
committees express their views on various bills, including those 
dealing with the labor code, the revised law on the organization 
of people's councils and people's committees, the revised law on 
the election of people's councillors, the tax law on the right 
to land use, and the law promoting domestic investments, the 
National Assembly Standing Committee gave its views on these 
bills and tasked various agencies with drafting these laws and 
relevant National Assembly committees with continuing to study 
to rectify them. Depending on the requirements of each project, 
they must solicit the views of the people and of various sectors 
and echelons, as well as of certain target people. On this 
basis, if these bills are found to be viable, they will be 
submitted to the National Assembly for consideration. 
  2. The National Assembly Standing Committee passed a 
regulation on procedures for resolving various economic court 
cases, regulations on supplementary taxes for those households 
using agricultural land exceeding the allocated quota, and a 
resolution on revising the tax rates of some groups of goods in 
the import tax chart. 
  The promulgation of a regulation on procedures for resolving 
economic court cases will create a legal basis for economic 
courts to resolve promptly various economic court cases in order 
to protect the state's interest and the legitimate interest of 
juristic persons. 
  The regulation on supplementary taxes for those households 
using agricultural land exceeding the allocated quota is 
designed to implement the agricultural tax policy promptly and 
uniformly to ensure the fair and reasonable character between 
the rights and the tax debt of those households using 
agricultural land. 
  The resolution on revising the tax rates of certain groups 
of 
goods in the import tax chart is designed to overcome gradually 
those irrationalities which have arisen in the process of 
economic management in order to protect and develop local 
production, protect consumer interest, increase the sources of 
revenue for the state, and suit the export-import situation in 
our country. 
  3. After giving its views on the draft of a regulation on 
providing favorable treatment to those having meritorious deeds 
with the nation and on the draft of a regulation revising 
certain articles of the regulation on home and land tax, the 
National Assembly Standing Committee asked relevant drafting 
organs to cooperate with the National Assembly's Social Affairs 
Committee and Economic and Budget Committee in studying ways to 
refine these two draft regulations in order to submit them to 
the National Assembly Standing Committee for approval in a later 
meeting. 
  4. The National Assembly commented on plans to ensure 
compliance with the statute governing the enactment of laws and 
regulations that was promulgated by the Council of State and the 
Eighth National Assembly in August 1988. This plan is designed 
to condense past experience and renovate the legislative work. 
On this basis, there have been necessary supplementary 
corrections on procedures and sequences in this work. 
  5. The National Assembly Standing Committee discussed and 
passed a resolution to promulgate a statute governing the 
cooperation between state organs in providing leadership for and 
organizing the implementation of a National Assembly resolution 
on practicing thrift and fighting wasteful spending, corruption, 
and smuggling in order to carry out effectively the National 
Assembly resolution on this matter. 
  6. The National Assembly Standing Committee decided to send 
out various teams of the National Assembly Standing Committee to 
review the situation regarding law enforcement, state budget 
distribution and spending, and the resolution of letters of 
complaints and denunciation in a number of sectors and 
localities. 
  7. The National Assembly Standing Committee heard a report 
on the results of the 21 February-1 March 1994 official 
friendship visit to the People's Republic of China by a 
Vietnamese National Assembly delegation led by National Assembly 
Chairman Nong Duc Manh. The National Assembly Standing Committee 
warmly welcomed and highly valued the fine results of this 
visit, saying that this marked a new development in the 
friendly, neighborly, and cooperative relations between the 
people and National Assemblies of Vietnam and China, thus 
contributing to the cause of socialist consolidation and 
construction in each country for the sake of peace, stability, 
cooperation, and development in the region and the rest of the 
world. 
  Also at this meeting, the National Assembly Standing 
Committee heard a report on the results of the 3-5 February 1994 
visit to Vietnam of a parliamentary delegation from the Kingdom 
of Thailand led by His Excellency Marut Bunag, chairman of the 
Thai Lower House, and the 2-5 March 1994 visit to Vietnam of a 
National Assembly delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia led by 
Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the National Assembly and acting 
head of state of Cambodia. The National Assembly Standing 
Committee warmly welcomed the results of these two significant 
visits, noting that they helped consolidate and strengthen the 
friendly, neighborly and cooperative relations between the 
people and the National Assembly of Vietnam on one side, and the 
peoples and National Assemblies of the Kingdoms of Thailand and 
Cambodia on the other for the sake of peace, stability, 
cooperation, and development in Southeast Asia and the rest of 
the world. 
  8. The National Assembly Standing Committee heard a report 
on the situation regarding the activities of various National 
Assembly delegations in deploying various resolutions of the 
recent Ninth National Assembly's Fourth Session. It also gave 
its views on a planned agenda and timing for the Ninth National 
Assembly's Fifth Session. 
  9. The National Assembly Standing Committee ratified a 
decision of the Chief Justice of Supreme People's Organ of 
Control on the establishment of a control body for 
implementation of court verdicts under the Supreme People's 
Organ of Control.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa instructed cabinet ministers Tuesday "to keep up with 
developments for seven to 10 days" over the suspected nuclear 
arms development by North Korea, government officials said. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) adopted a 
resolution Monday to refer Pyongyang's refusal of full 
inspections of its nuclear facilities to the United Nations 
Security Council. 
  Hosokawa said he was gravely concerned over the situation 
and 
was keeping it under close observation, the officials said. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said in a 
separate 
press meeting that government ministries and agencies have 
started considering possible punitive measures against North 
Korea in preparation for the possibility of the United Nations 
Security Council adopting sanctions. Takemura also said it is 
important to exchange information with the United States and 
South Korea over the issue. 
  As for the large-scale transfer of goods and funds to North 
Korea by pro-Pyongyang Korean residents in Japan, government 
sources said it would be difficult to suspend such remittances 
even if sanctions were imposed. The sources said, however, that 
the government would consider the remittance issue. 
  The sources also said that Japan will have to take a harder 
stand toward North Korea since it is likely Pyongyang would 
target Japan if it develops nuclear bombs.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- Government officials met 
unofficially Tuesday [22 March] to start discussing possible 
measures to halt the flow of Japanese money to North Korea, 
which allegedly funds a suspected nuclear arms development 
program. 
  The officials are considering banning cash remittances, 
grounding North Korea-bound sea vessels and aircraft, conducting 
export checks at Niigata on the Sea of Japan and refusing to 
issue reentry permits to travelers going to the isolated 
socialist state, government sources said. 
  North Korea denies that it is trying to build an atomic bomb 
but continues to deny international inspectors access to its 
more suspicious facilities. On Monday, the UN nuclear monitor 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) urged Pyongyang to 
comply with its safeguard measures and referred the issue to the 
UN Security Council, which could impose sanctions. 
  Analysts have suggested that the sanctions would have little 
effect on the already impoverished nation, which receives 
backing from China and an estimated 60 billion yen annually from 
pro-Pyongyang Korean residents in Japan. 
  Attempts to halt the money flow are likely to be thwarted by 
a confusing array of routes the money takes through banks, in 
cash, in trade transactions and through third nations on its 
journey from Japan to North Korea. Some is sent to relatives of 
Korean residents living in Japan but the U.S. insists the money 
is being used to fund the alleged arms program. 
  If sanctions are imposed, the government intends to do what 
it can within the limits of the law but worries about 
remittances making their way to Pyongyang through third nations, 
informed sources said. 
  Government sources suggested the Security Council will 
likely 
seek a way for the inspectors to complete the inspections in 
North Korea and is not immediately discussing a resolution on 
sanctions. 
  The sources said Japan intends to keep close contacts with 
the U.S., China and South Korea in an attempt to reach a 
peaceful resolution to the nuclear problem through dialogue.

<F P=106> ["News analysis" by Miu Oikawa Dieter: "Hosokawa Fails To </F>
Score Big on Diplomatic Front"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to China offered him a brief moment of 
relief away from domestic woes, but apparently failed to serve 
as a catalyst to boost his political strength. Facing a series 
of political setbacks at home such as failures to introduce a 
new tax and to carry out a cabinet reshuffle, as well as being 
linked to a money scandal, Hosokawa would have liked to score 
big on the diplomatic front to revamp his plunging public image. 
  Since his three-day China trip came at a highly sensitive 
time on the international front regarding North Korea's 
suspected development of nuclear arms and U.S.-China relations 
over human rights, Hosokawa did speak out on these matters, 
going a step further than he had before. 
  He criticized North Korea in unusually harsh terms for 
refusing to let inspectors from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) conduct full checks on its nuclear facilities and 
stressed the urgency of the situation. He also broached the 
delicate issue of China's human rights. 
  Hosokawa told reporters aboard a government plane back to 
Tokyo on Monday [21 March] at the end of his three-day trip that 
he was able to engage in "substantial and meaningful" 
discussions with Chinese Premier Li Peng and President Jiang 
Zemin. But he apparently fell short of gaining anything new 
from the Chinese leadership. 
  In addition, Hosokawa's bluntness rather exposed differences 
of positions between Japan and China. 
  When Hosokawa said the international community's patience in 
coping with the problems of North Korea is "nearing its limit" 
and cited the possibility of the matter being brought up at the 
United Nations Security Council, the Chinese leaders only 
reiterated their previous position that the matter should be 
resolved through "patient negotiations." China's Foreign 
Ministry said China disapproves of the matter being taken up by 
the Security Council and that the issue should be settled 
through dialogue by "parties concerned," namely, China, North 
and South Korea, the United States and the IAEA. 
  Japan was not included in the list of "parties concerned." 
  Hosokawa, pressed by U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, also urged China to improve its human rights 
record. But he did so in a low-key way by pointing out that 
human rights are a "universal value" recognized by the 
international community and by referring to a declaration 
adopted at an international conference on human rights last June 
in Vienna. He refused to comment on specific cases involving 
the detention of pro-democracy activists. 
  Hosokawa, who has been trying to stress that his 
administration represents a change from those of his 
predecessors, also failed to go beyond earlier expressions of 
regret for Japan's wartime responsibilities, despite indications 
by government sources that he might cite specific cases -- such 
as the Nanjing massacre and germ warfare experiments -- when 
offering an apology. 
  In talks with the Chinese leaders, Hosokawa merely repeated 
the line in a policy speech last August in which he expressed 
"deep remorse and apologies for the fact that past Japanese 
actions, including aggression and colonial rule, caused 
unbearable suffering and sorrow for so many people." 
  The only time he said anything new was when he visited 
Shanghai's Pudong economic development zone. 
  When Shanghai officials called for Japanese companies to set 
up operations in the area, Hosokawa, using his experience as 
governor of the southern Japan prefecture of Kumamoto, gave them 
detailed advice on how to attract Japanese firms, such as making 
promotional videos. His comments were welcomed by Shanghai 
officials with vigorous nods.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- An Anglo-Japanese 
consortium has signed a contract to conduct a feasibility study 
for oil development in the Tarim Basin in far western China, a 
Japanese partner reported Tuesday [22 March]. 
  Nippon Oil Co., Japan's leading distributor of oil products, 
said the agreement was signed in Beijing Tuesday with China's 
state-run National Petroleum and Natural Gas Corp. The group 
consists of BP Exploration Operating Co., an oil development arm 
of British Petroleum, and four Japanese oil and trading firms, 
including an affiliate of Nippon Oil. 
  Under the three-year contract, the group will engage in a 
feasibility study on the development of oil deposits in the 
southeastern region of the basin, the company said. 
  The company said the group has an option to negotiate with 
the Chinese corporation for oil production in the area. It said 
the study will begin in April.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- Permanent tax cuts and 
other macroeconomic measures will not feature in Japan's 
market-opening package to be unveiled this month, Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii suggested Tuesday [22 March]. "I don't 
think such measures were spelled out," he said of the 
government's decision on February 25 to compile the package of 
measures to address the Japan-U.S. trade disputes. 
  Fujii was speaking at a regular press conference after a 
morning cabinet meeting. 
  "The centerpiece will be the four key measures and the 
actions in three priority areas" of the stalled trade framework 
talks with the United States, Fujii said. 
  His comments in effect ruled out recent remarks by Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura calling for inclusion of 
tax and other macroeconomic measures in the forthcoming package. 
  The four key measures cited are deregulation, boosting 
imports, facilitating competition through stronger enforcement 
of the antimonopoly law, and expanding government procurement. 
  The three "framework" priority areas are insurance, 
automobile and auto parts, and government procurement of 
telecommunications and medical equipment. 
  Fujii has repeatedly told the U.S. side that Japan would 
conduct a "full-fledged" tax reform, including permanent tax 
cuts, as the ruling coalition has vowed to do so by the end of 
the year. 
  He has also repeatedly said that the latest 15.25 trillion 
yen stimulus package would put the economy on the path of 
full-scale recovery in the coming fiscal year. 
  Fujii said he and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen 
agreed to tackle bilateral trade talks in a "cooperative mood as 
we did at the APEC meeting." The finance minister and Bentsen 
held talks on Friday in Hawaii ahead of a two-day meeting there 
of finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) forum. 
  Fujii stressed, "the greatest importance for the government 
is to clearly show its voluntary measures this month." 
  U.S. officials have indicated that the U.S. would assess the 
possibility of resuming the stalled framework talks after 
reviewing the market-opening package Japan promised to compile 
by the end of this month. 
  On increasing international tension involving North Korea's 
nuclear issue, Fujii said his ministry will follow the 
government's decision in line with any United Nations 
resolution. He was referring to possible suspension of bank 
remittances from Japan to North Korea if the UN decides on trade 
sanctions against Pyongyang.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- Transport Minister Shigeru 
Ito criticized the Trade Ministry Tuesday [22 March] for taking 
a different approach on the import procedures of automobiles 
that are often criticized by other countries as a nontariff 
trade barrier. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is simply 
making "noise" and trying to "lighten its load," Ito said at a 
regular press meeting. He was reacting to recent moves by the 
Trade Ministry calling for relaxation of automotive import 
procedures. 
  Japan sets detailed and stringent standards on car 
mechanisms, especially concerning emissions and safety, and 
requires inspection of every unit. Approvals called "type 
certificates" are issued for volume imports of individual models. 
  The Transport Ministry, which is responsible for enforcing 
the procedures, assumes the attitude that accusations by Japan's 
trade partners that the system constitutes a trade barrier 
derive from a lack of information. 
  As part of an effort to ease such criticism, the ministry 
sent officials to Detroit earlier this month to explain their 
position and provide information. 
  The Trade Ministry, however, has criticized the system 
itself 
as having problems, such as a long time required to get through 
the entire import process.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- The supply of rice is 
steady and the fuss over the shortage of Japanese rice which at 
one time sent people queueing at shops seems to have calmed 
down, Farm Minister Eijiro Hata said Tuesday [22 March]. 
  "About 200,000 tons of rice will be further imported this 
month, and the supply is being steadily boosted," Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries Minister Hata told a meeting of cabinet 
ministers. He said there are fewer calls about rice from the 
public on the emergency telephone lines set up within the 
ministry and nationwide at the Food Agency's branch offices. 
"At one time, all the lines were full, but we got only 29 calls 
on Monday," Hata said. 
  Hata admitted to reporters after the cabinet meeting that 
his 
ministry's response to the rice shortage was inadequate. "We 
should have told the public at an earlier stage about the 
prospects of supply in the upcoming month," he said. 
  He also conceded that there were problems with the way the 
ministry ordered the much-criticized blending of domestic rice 
and imported rice. "We ought to respond with more flexibility 
since changes in the economy and the trend among consumers are 
proceeding at a rapid pace," he said. 
  Later in the day, the farm minister apologized to an 
agricultural committee at the house of representatives for 
having gone on with reducing rice production last year when the 
harvest was hit by the bad weather. 
  He indicated, however, that the government will go on 
cutting 
down on the amount of land devoted to rice production in the 
years ahead. "If we discontinue with rice reductions, there 
will be an oversupply that would have an effect on rice prices 
and on the incomes of farms," the minister said. 
  Asked about the issue of revising the food control law, Hata 
said that its structure will be maintained, but that the 
government will actively adopt the principle of competition.

  [Text] Niigata, March 22 KYODO -- A Russian-registered 
oceanographic survey ship left here Tuesday [22 March] on a 
mission to monitor the effects on the Sea of Japan of 
radioactive waste dumping by a vessel of the Russian Pacific 
Fleet last year, Japanese Government officials said. 
  The dispatch of the 4,162-ton Okean by Japan, Russia and 
South Korea was called for by a conference of scientists held in 
the Russian far east city of Vladivostok last month. The Okean 
carries nine Japanese Government officials and 27 scientists 
from South Korea, Russia and the Vienna-based International 
Atomic Energy Agency. 
  The voyage is the first joint research effort by the three 
countries to study whether the sea is contaminated by 
radioactivity. Seawater and seabed sediment samples will be 
collected by the Okean at seven points and measured for 
radioactivity, the officials said. 
  The Russian Navy on October 16 and 17 last year dumped 900 
tons of liquid nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan. A planned 
second dumping was canceled following protests from Japan and 
South Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- A Vietnamese commerce 
representative voiced hope Tuesday [22 March] for increased 
Japanese investment as Japan ranks sixth among nations investing 
in the communist country. 
  Though Japan had invested a historical total of 400 million 
dollars in Vietnam as of the end 1993, Doan Duy Thanh, president 
of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vietnam, said in an 
interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE that Japanese investment 
should "dramatically increase." 
  Thanh cited construction materials, cement and food 
processing as promising areas for Japanese corporations 
considering investment in Vietnam. 
  Thanh said Washington's February 3 lifting of its 19-year 
trade embargo against Vietnam may increase the number of rivals 
for Japanese companies. 
  "But Japanese firms, well versed in Vietnamese business 
practices through years of dealing with the country, have an 
edge over companies from other countries," Thanh said. 
"Japanese companies have the capability to make products 
well-tailored to the needs of Vietnamese people." 
  Thanh said he would like to see Japan boost investment 
particularly in central Vietnam. 
  The infrastructure of the area is still "poor" compared with 
Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, and this problem could hinder quick 
recovery of investment in the area, Thanh said. But due to a 
vast amount of untapped natural resources, investment in the 
region should prove "highly lucrative" to foreign companies in 
the long run, Thanh said. 
  Thanh said Vietnam hopes to introduce a rice-breeding 
technique from Japan with an eye toward rice exports in future. 
He said Vietnam's infrastructure is insufficient, calling that 
the main factor in discouraging foreign investment in the 
country. 
  Thanh said Vietnam is doing its utmost to improve the 
situation, using Official Development Assistance (ODA) funds. 
  Vietnam is also upgrading its legal and administrative 
framework to smooth international business deals while striving 
to infuse a market mechanism through economic restructuring, he 
added. 
  On overall economic development, Thanh said Vietnam needs to 
raise between 45 billion and 50 billion dollars within this 
decade, including 15 to 20 billion dollars in foreign investment 
and aid. 
  Japan's cumulative investment in Vietnam was the sixth 
largest as of the end of 1993 after Taiwan, Hong Kong, South 
Korea, Australia and France. When figures so far this year were 
taken into account, Japan might have surpassed Australia and 
France on a cumulative basis, becoming the fourth biggest 
investor in Vietnam, Thanh said. 
  He welcomed the U.S. decision to lift its trade embargo but 
said relations between the two countries could still be 
improved. Vietnam hopes the U.S. will soon grant 
most-favored-nation trade status, he said. 
  Thanh said that in the first one month and a half since the 
removal of the U.S. embargo, the number of U.S. businessmen who 
came to Vietnam reached 25 percent of the total number for the 
whole of 1993. He said that Hanoi is now formulating an 
investment guideline on the U.S. and other countries with 
particular emphasis on foreign interest in such sectors as heavy 
industry, machinery, food processing, forestry, mineral 
development, light industry and tourism. 
  Thanh came to Japan for a business conference sponsored by 
the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren). The 
three-day meeting of top businessmen from 12 countries in Asia 
ended Monday.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- Japan's economy contracted 
in the last quarter of 1993 but unexpected firmness in personal 
consumption curbed the decline, the Economic Planning Agency 
said Tuesday [22 March]. The long-slumping economy is still 
expected to start recovering in the fiscal year starting next 
month, but the timing remains uncertain, said Tsutomu Tanaka, 
the agency's vice minister. 
  Real gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 0.6 percent in the 
October-December period from the previous quarter, or an annual 
rate of 2.2 percent, the agency said in a quarterly report. 
  That performance beat an average 4.2 percent contraction 
predicted by economists at 25 institutions in a recent KYODO 
NEWS SERVICE survey that found forecasts of shrinkage ranging 
from 1.0 to 5.9 percent. 
  Japan's real GDP, the value of all goods and services 
produced in the country, grew 0.1 percent in calendar 1993, the 
agency said. Gross national product, which also includes net 
income from abroad, expanded 0.1 percent in 1993. 
  To meet the government's estimate of 0.2 percent real GDP 
growth for fiscal 1993 ending this month, Tanaka said real GDP 
must grow 1.26 percent in the current quarter, or at an annual 
rate of 5.1 percent. He said such growth was "not impossible." 
  But despite such growing bright spots as personal 
consumption, which was up 0.7 percent for the quarter, he said 
it is too early to confirm whether the economy has hit bottom. 
Data for the current quarter could confirm a low point, he 
added. 
  "The economy remains broadly sluggish," Tanaka said of the 
report, which adjusts the GDP figures for inflation. But he 
noted "partial brightness," especially within the personal 
consumption category. 
  "As for judging if that was the bottom, we cannot make that 
determination yet," Tanaka said. 
  For the economy to break even for fiscal 1993, GDP must grow 
a real 0.65 percent this quarter, he said. Such a pickup in the 
January-March quarter could be helped by typical fiscal year-end 
factors as companies prepare to close their books. 
  Housing investment rose 1.8 percent after the previous 
quarter's impressive 9.0 percent growth. Personal consumption 
added 0.4 point to GDP, with strength in such housing-related 
areas as large appliances and other durable goods, as well as 
spending on travel, Tanaka said. 
  But overall, domestic demand was flat, he said, with the 
report showing no boosting or retarding effect by domestic 
demand on the economy. 
  Corporate capital spending continued to slump in the 
quarter, 
and the net export of goods and services -- hurt by the strong 
yen -- was a 0.6 percentage point drag on GDP, the report said. 
  With capital spending expected to remain on the decline, 
Japan will be able to muster only the gentlest of recoveries 
late in fiscal 1994, said Nobuyuki Saji, chief economist at 
Nikko Research Center. 
  Fiscal year-end factors may boost the economy this quarter, 
but their absence will probably pull GDP back into minus 
territory in the following three months, he said. "It's one 
step forward and one step back," Saji said. 
  The fiscal second half, which starts in October, will 
probably witness 1.5 percent growth from the same period a year 
earlier, he said. But Tuesday's reported healthy gain in 
personal spending, which comprises the bulk of domestic demand, 
indicates that the "risk of another decline has largely 
subsided," Saji said. 
  The personal consumption gain, boosted by home appliance 
sales, was a bit more than expected, said chief economist Masaru 
Takagi at Fuji Research Institute. 
  But the continued slump in spending on plants and equipment 
was a prime drag that kept the economy from expanding in the 
quarter, he said. A shrinkage of exports due to the high yen 
will probably continue to weigh on the economy, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- A plunge by Japan's 
economy similar to the relapse that occurred last year is "hard 
to imagine," economic planning chief Manae Kubota said Tuesday 
[22 March]. 
  This year has seen no comparable surge in the yen's value, 
which hit the apparently stabilizing economy last spring and 
contributed greatly to its subsequent declines, the head of the 
Economic Planning Agency told a regular press conference after a 
morning cabinet meeting. 
  Kubota declined direct comment on the October-December gross 
domestic product report that her agency is to issue Tuesday 
afternoon. But she noted that among the negative factors, such 
as weak corporate balance sheets amid the ongoing write-offs of 
bad debt, there is the emergence of such bright spots as 
apparent progress on stock adjustment, industrial production 
gains, improved sales of durable goods and pickups in tourism, 
machinery orders and in some segments of the auto industry. 
  Kubota also cited the apparent halt to declines in corporate 
sentiment reported in the Bank of Japan's "Tankan" survey taken 
in February. 
  Asked about the afternoon's quarterly economic report, she 
noted the mix of the bad with the good and said, "it's a barrier 
we must pass through step by step" before the economy can 
recover. 
  She acknowledged that the currency markets retain a "high 
yen 
tone," but said there have been "no big changes" in the yen's 
rate similar to the sharp rise starting February 1993 that saw 
it surge from around 120 yen to the dollar to the postwar record 
100.40 yen to the dollar in August. The yen "seems to be in a 
stable condition," she added. 
  Such gains by the Japanese currency pummel the 
export-reliant 
economy by pushing up export prices in terms of other currencies.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- Japan's economy shrank an 
inflation-adjusted 0.6 percent in the October-December period 
from the preceding quarter, or at an annual pace of 2.2 percent, 
the Economic Planning Agency said in a preliminary report 
Tuesday. 
  Domestic demand contributed to pushing up the gross domestic 
product (GDP) by 0.0 percentage point and external demand to 
depressing it by 0.6 percentage point, the agency said. 
Consumer spending, one of the prime engines of domestic demand, 
rose 0.7 percent from the previous quarter, while another 
pillar, corporate capital spending, declined 3.5 percent. 
  Meanwhile, Japan's real or inflation-adjusted gross national 
product (GNP) during the quarter shrank 0.4 percent from the 
quarter before, or an annualized 1.6 percent. 
  GDP and GNP represent the total output of goods and 
services, 
with the GDP excluding net income from abroad. Starting with 
the previous quarter, the agency switched its emphasis from GNP 
to GDP to assess the nation's economic performance more 
accurately in line with international trends.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- The No. 1 opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) ended part of its Diet boycott 
Tuesday [22 March], agreeing to enact a set of 16 bills and a 
fiscal 1994 stopgap budget by the end of this month, officials 
said. Parliamentary strategists from the coalition and 
opposition camps reached the accord in a meeting. 
  The 16 bills are mostly budget-related ones. The provisional 
budget, which is expected to total around 11 trillion yen, 
covers government spending in the initial 50 days of fiscal 1994 
starting April 1. 
  However, the LDP refused to comply with a coalition request 
to launch deliberations on the 73.08 trillion yen full budget 
for fiscal 1994 by the House of Representatives Budget 
Committee, the officials said. The prospect for the opening of 
the key parliamentary committee session has remained uncertain, 
they said. 
  During the day's meeting of parliamentary strategists, the 
coalition asked the LDP to accept their proposal to allow the 
cabinet to explain the new state budget before the committee, 
they said. Sadatoshi Ozato, chairman of the LDP Diet Affairs 
Committee rejected the request, renewing an LDP demand that 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa provide more information about 
his 100 million yen loan from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin 
trucking group. 
  Meanwhile, Hosokawa again turned down the opposition demand 
to submit documents that would corroborate his claims that he 
repaid the 100 million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin Co. Hosokawa 
told reporters at his official residence, "there is nothing I 
can do" to comply with the LDP's demand to see the financial 
documents on the Sagawa loan to help revive parliamentary 
discussion on the fiscal 1994 budget bill. 
  Neither would Hosokawa bend on his earlier refusal to 
arrange 
for his former financial secretary, Masatoshi Miyama, to appear 
before the Diet committee to testify concerning LDP allegations 
that Hosokawa accepted the money as an unreported political 
donation. 
  Sagawa Kyubin was at the center of a 1992-1993 money-and-mob 
scandal which involved now retired LDP power broker Shin 
Kanemaru and former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- No officials from the 
Construction Ministry who have retired so far this year have 
taken jobs with major construction companies implicated in a 
series of bribery scandals, the ministry said Tuesday [22 
March]. It said no senior ministry officials who have retired 
since January went to any of the 59 major construction companies 
affiliated with the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors 
or smaller companies outside the federation. 
  Figures released by Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi 
after 
a cabinet meeting showed that the 20 retired lower-ranking who 
did find jobs in the industry went to smaller firms. The figure 
compared with the 163 former ministry employees who found 
employment in the construction industry after retirement in the 
whole of 1992. 
  None of the 20 had seniority higher than section chief, 
compared with four above that rank for the same period in 1993. 
  Since most staff retire from the ministry in April, ministry 
sources say the number of staff announcing their intended 
retirement by then differs little from the total for the year. 
  In August 1993, the then Construction Minister, Kishiro 
Nakamura, officially discouraged the practice whereby its 
employees found postretirement positions in companies with which 
they had had close dealings while serving in the bureaucracy. 
The practice was criticized as a cause of corruption. 
  Nakamura was arrested March 11 in a bribery case. Meanwhile, 
the Tokyo district court extended for 10 days the period of 
detention of former Construction Minister Nakamura, who was 
arrested on suspicion of bribe taking. 
  The court approved the prosecutors' request for Nakamura's 
detention for an additional period from Wednesday to April 1, 
court officials said. 
  Nakamura, 44, is suspected of receiving a 10 million yen 
bribe from leading contractor Kajima Corp. as a reward for 
helping quash the filing of a criminal charge by the Fair Trade 
Commission in connection with a bid-rigging affair in Saitama 
Prefecture in 1992. Since his arrest on March 11, Nakamura has 
refused to answer questions from prosecutors, investigative 
sources said.

  [Text] Yokohama, March 20 KYODO -- Two new faces Sunday 
[20 March] filed as candidates to challenge the incumbent in the 
April 3 mayoral election in Yokohama, Japan's second most 
populous city. 
  The three men who filed candidacy papers were incumbent 
mayor 
Hidenobu Takahide, 64, and challengers Toshihiko Izu, 67, and 
Takashi Nomura, 40. 
  All three are independents. 
  Takahide, who is seeking a second four-year term of office, 
has gained the backing of the Liberal Democratic Party, the 
Social Democratic Party, Komeito, Shinseito (Japan Renewal 
Party) and the Democratic Socialist Party. 
  Izu, a professor emeritus at Yokohama City University, is 
backed by the Japanese Communist Party, while Nomura, a former 
Home Affairs Ministry bureaucrat, has garnered support from new 
party Sakigake and the United Social Democratic Party. 
  Yokohama, the largest international port city in Japan, has 
a 
population of 3.3 million, ranking second after Tokyo which has 
a population of more than eight million. 
  The challengers have accused Takahide of having received a 
huge amount of election campaign funds from general contractors. 
Takahide denies the allegation.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 19 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Saturday [19 March] that Japan should take the 
initiative in leading world disarmament in a videotaped message 
to this year's alumni of the Defense Academy. 
  Hosokawa delivered the message by videotape since he cannot 
attend the Defense Academy graduation ceremony on Sunday due to 
his visit to China which started Saturday. 
  "We must lead disarmament...in the world," Hosokawa said. 
  It is unusual for a prime minister to stress disarmament in 
a 
message to graduates of the Defense Academy, defense sources 
said. 
  Hosokawa, pointing out drastic changes in the international 
situation following the end of the Cold War, also called for 
fresh ideas regarding the nation's defense program. 
  It is the first time that a prime minister will not attend a 
Defense Academy graduation since 1978, when then prime Minister 
Takeo Fukuda failed to attend because of illness.

  [Text] Yokosuka, Kanagawa Pref. [prefecture], March 20 
KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura on Sunday 
[20 March] told the graduating class of the National Defense 
Academy that Japan should reconsider its defense policies in the 
post-cold war world. 
  "Considering the changes in the international situation 
since 
the end of the cold war and the remarkable progress in science 
and technology, it is important, with regard to the way the 
defensive strength of our nation should be, that the government 
indicate a new fundamental thinking," Takemura said. 
  Takemura spoke on behalf of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, 
who has been in China for a three-day official visit since 
Saturday. 
  Defense Agency [DA] chief Kazuo Aichi also said Japan must 
have a more divergent way of thinking than in the past on the 
defense of the nation in the post-cold war era. 
  "The role of the Self-Defense Forces which positively 
contributes to the peace and stability of the world through the 
United Nations will continue to grow larger," said Aichi, 
indicating a future increase in Japan's participation in U.N. 
peacekeeping operations.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- A team of researchers at 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) said Tuesday [22 
March] it has developed a new thin film for possible use in a 
magnetic disk with the memory capacity nearly 100 times that of 
conventional ones. The researchers made the breakthrough by 
discovering a magnet with a diameter of 8 nanometers 
(one-billionth of a meter), contained in a cobalt-chrome alloy 
crystal, they said. 
  Conventional magnetic films are made up from an alloy 
crystal 
60 nanometers in diameter, according to the researchers. 
  The discovery of the new alloy film is expected to pave the 
way for the production of the increased capacity magnetic disk, 
the primary storage medium for computers, which they said will 
be put into practical use in a few years. 
  The current magnetic disk with a diameter of 2.5 inches has 
a 
memory capacity the equivalent to 10-day's volume of a major 
Japanese-language morning newspaper.

<F P=106> [Article by former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser: "Global </F>
Import of U.S. Disdain"] 
  [Text] The American approach to the solution of its trade 
problems with Japan could destroy all the potential benefits of 
the Uruguay Round. The American approach calls into question 
United States commitment to multilateral trade negotiations and 
emphasises its reliance on bilateral approaches in which its own 
overwhelming power and influence can be exercised to the full. 
  In part almost unnoticed, but in the first month after the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was signed, the US cut 
Australia's meat quotas into its domestic market and increased 
subsidies on exported grain in a manner damaging to Australia's 
export markets. 
  There have been enormous claims made for the benefits to 
Australia and other countries as a result of the conclusion of 
the Uruguay Round. I readily concede that the Australian 
Government's efforts were as good as they could have been and 
the initiative in establishing the Cairns Group was a worthy 
one. The claims, however, for Australia's future benefit are 
likely to be significantly overrated, for two reasons. 
  First, nearly every country in Europe and the US and most of 
the successful Asian countries adopt aggressive industry 
policies designed to maximise the competitive strength of their 
own industries and to assist in the development of new 
industries. Asian countries use specific tax breaks, together 
with import protection and administrative devices to protect 
their industries. 
  Such measures are not isolated. Throughout Asia, those 
countries with recently established car industries provide very 
significant protection, ranging up to 200 per cent. At the 
other end of the industrial scale, food processing industries 
are heavily protected so that they can develop free of threats 
from imports. 
  The European and the American car markets are far more 
heavily protected than is the Australian. The US has voluntary 
export agreements with European and Japanese car manufacturers 
which limit market share of imported cars to around 15 per cent 
of the American market. In Europe, 8 per cent of the market can 
be filled by exports from other countries. In Australia, where 
governments have not worked to develop active industry policies, 
the import penetration of motor vehicles is about 40 per cent. 
Since 1988, the motor vehicle trade deficit has almost doubled 
from a little over $3 billion to well over $6 billion. 
  There are widespread fears that Australia's current account 
deficit will blow out significantly as the recovery moves 
forward. The longer term trends are already ominous. A year ago 
the trend monthly current account deficit stood at S1.141 
billion. Now, with the recovery only just gathering pace, it 
has already expanded to $1.422 billion. 
  These factors provide substantial arguments in favour of an 
industry policy whose objective would be to strengthen 
Australia's industrial base and to expand Australian jobs, 
rather than foreign jobs. 
  We should note in particular the specific methods and 
techniques the US is now threatening to use to force Japan to 
buy more products made in the US. In certain specific industry 
areas, the US wants Japan to specify quantitative targets for 
purchases of particular products from the US. 
  Such a technique is of course, totally contrary to GATT. It 
is absolutely outlawed under any civilised code of international 
behaviour. It is sanctioned by America's own Omnibus Trade 
Legislation, which provides the American legislature and 
executive with every conceivable arbitrary and punitive power 
against other countries. 
  If a country such as Australia passed equivalent 
legislation, 
it would be laughed at around the world. The US can pass such 
legislation and place the demands that it has recently placed 
upon Japan, simply because it is the most powerful country in 
the world. 
  One should not be surprised, therefore, that the US is now 
getting very close to using its arbitrary powers against Japan. 
If it does, I suggest the entire benefit of the Uruguay Round 
will soon disintegrate. The European Union may be more subtle 
than America, but will not be far behind in using equivalent 
measures against Japan. 
  The second reason is that both the US and Europe would then 
be likely to target other successful countries in Asia. All of 
Asia is watching the trade disputes between the US and Japan, 
fearful of the outcome. The American approach, if continued, 
will have disastrous consequences for relationships between 
nations. 
  We often forget that the last World War in the Pacific was, 
in part at least, caused because Japan had been chucked out of 
market after market around the world. 
  Japan's continuing trade surplus does create problems. Some 
part of that surplus is now currency driven because of the 
appreciation of the yen. My understanding is that a number of 
Japanese manufacturing companies are in fact under extreme 
pressure as a result of the present value of the yen and there 
is the possibility of a major collapse in some sections of 
Japanese manufacturing industry as a result of that currency 
appreciation. 
  The US actions run the risk of aborting whatever results 
have 
flowed from the Uruguay Round and reversing those constructive 
elements. The US should take their case against Japan to GATT 
and argue it through in international forums. That might give a 
clearer understanding of the Japanese position than many people 
now have. It should not be forgotten that many companies, 
including many American companies, trade in Japan with a great 
deal of success. 
  The GATT settlement procedure could lead to a result 
acceptable both to Japan and the US. GATT could have power to 
intervene in the dispute and to demand that it be settled within 
GATT procedures. That it, in effect, does not have such power 
demonstrates quite clearly that the great and powerful can 
ignore international institutions when they believe it suits 
their purpose.

  [Text] Australia has expressed its concern over the 
apparent stalling by the American Congress in implementing 
legislation necessary to complete the much-delayed Uruguay Round 
of world trade negotiations. The Australian treasurer, Ralph 
Willis, says he raised the matter during a meeting in Honolulu 
with the American treasury secretary, Mr. Lloyd Bentsen. He 
said he received an assurance that the legislation would 
definitely be passed by July next year. The two men were in 
Honolulu for the inaugural meeting of finance ministers of the 
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. Mr. Willis also said 
that during the meeting some countries made it clear they were 
not going to be pushed into too rapid liberalization of their 
capital markets. 
  [Begin Willis recording] The Malaysians, for instance, have 
made it clear that they believe they had already opened their 
capital markets considerably and that they were concerned that 
if they simply abandoned all control in the banking industry, 
for instance, they could (?simply) be (?flooded) by foreign 
capital. So, there is no arguing about the direction of change; 
it was rather concerns being expressed by some of the developing 
countries about the points at which they could cope with the 
current liberalization of their economy. [end recording]

  [Text] The Cook Islands prime minister, Sir Geoffrey 
Henry, has been urged to take a firmer stand over allegations 
that Cook Islands is using its tax haven to defraud other 
nations. 
  The call has come from the Cook Islands high commissioner to 
Australia, Vincent Ingram, who has warned the allegations could 
severly affect the country. 
  Mr. Ingram has returned to Rarotonga to advise Sir Geoffrey 
on the issue. He said he has told the prime minister to take a 
more interventionist approach to the matter. 
  The allegations were made earlier this week by the New 
Zealand parliamentarian, Winston Peters. Mr. Peters told the 
New Zealand parliament that Cook Islands Government was 
operating financial scams worth millions of dollars. He tabled 
documents he said supported his claims. 
  Reports from Rarotonga say that today, Sir Geoffrey has said 
he will not look at the documents and he has denied any 
wrongdoing.

  [Text] Suva, March 21 (AFP) -- Fiji will seek to resume 
full diplomatic relations with India and rejoin the 
Commonwealth, President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara said when opening 
parliament here Monday. 
  The Fijian government broke off diplomatic relations with 
India in 1989 after it accused Indian diplomatic staff of 
becoming involved in Fijian politics. 
  "The government will seek to resume full diplomatic 
relations 
with India, and will invite the government of India to re-open 
its embassy in Fiji as soon as is practicable," Ratu Mara said. 
  The president also announced that the government of Prime 
Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, returned to power in general elections 
last month, would seek to regain Fiji's seat in the Commonwealth. 
  "Fiji sincerely hopes that this can be achieved in the not 
too distant future," Ratu Mara said. 
  Fiji's membership of the Commonwealth lapsed in 1987 after 
brigadier Rabuka, now prime minister, led two military coups 
against an ethnic Indian-dominated government and declared Fiji 
a republic. 
  The Indian government has said it would block a Fijian 
application for membership unless the country changed its 
constitution, which favours ethnic Fijians. 
  Under the 1990 constitution, ethnic Indians are restricted 
to 
27 seats in the 70-seat House of Representatives and are barred 
from holding the prime ministership. 
  Ratu Mara said the government considered a review of the 
constitution to be a priority. 
  "Government will move quickly to reconvene the expanded 
cabinet subcommittee on the constitution so as to resume 
consultations on the next phase in the review process," he told 
parliament. 
  The review would seek agreement on the composition and 
membership of an independent commission to undertake a review. 
The constitution provided for a review within seven years. 
  "History has created for us a society from which we cannot 
run away, but it is our responsibility as leaders to build upon 
this inheritance and create a viable and vibrant nation of which 
we can all be proud," Ratu Mara said. 
  A Ministry of Information spokesman said diplomatic ties 
with 
India were originally broken off because "they were seen to be 
meddling in our political affairs and were told to go, but they 
are now welcome to come back.

  [Text] Wellington, March 21 (AFP) -- New Zealand should 
stop trying to revive its military alliance with the United 
States and instead equip itself to work with multinational 
defence forces in the United Nations, Disarmament and Arms 
Control Minister Doug Graham said in a speech Monday. 
  Since 1985 New Zealand has been excluded from the Anzus 
(Australia, New Zealand and US) defence pact because of its 
anti-nuclear policies. Although the current government is 
committed to retaining the anti-nuclear laws, it has also said 
it wants to renew defence ties with the US. 
  Graham said it was now unlikely the Anzus alliance could be 
restored and he pointed out that traditional alliances carried 
risks of dragging unwilling partners into conflicts anyway. 
  "The issue we should be considering in 1994 is whether the 
world has moved on to such an extent that alliances of one sort 
or the other do more harm than good," he said. 
  Conflicts like that in Yugoslavia and the Gulf could more or 
less be contained and were unlikely to erupt into global war. 
But traditional multilateral alliances could force unwilling 
partners into the conflict. 
  New Zealand could not afford to defend itself alone against 
sophisticated modern weaponry. 
  "I believe it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify 
diverting money from hospitals to hardware for defence forces 
designed to provide some self-sufficiency," Graham said. 
  But it should look to the UN rather than traditional 
alliances. 
  The decreasing threat of all-out nuclear conflict and the 
rise of the UN had made traditional alliances less appropriate. 
  New Zealand faced three choices. 
  It could try to equip its forces as best it could and hope 
that any conflict it was involved in was small and sophisticated 
weapons were not deployed, or it could throw its lot in with a 
country with sophisticated weaponry like the United States. 
  "A third option is to recognise the futility in trying to 
keep up with technology and to rely more and more on the United 
Nations to protect our interests should they ever be 
threatened," he said. 
  The UN, despite funding and bureaucratic problems was still 
the best global answer to conflict. 
  "The UN, in its role as the world's police force, may find 
that its time has come at long last," he said.

  [Text] President Ramos directed the three government peace 
panels yesterday to speed up negotiations with the military 
rebels, the communist insurgents, and the Muslim secessionists, 
and finally forge peace agreements without compromising the 
country's national sovereignty and interest. Stressing that 
acts of violence must now come to an end, the president issued 
the directive during a three-hour meeting with the members of 
the three peace panels headed by Professor Alfredo Tadiar and 
former Ambassadors Howard Dee and Manuel Yan. 
  Based on their reports, the chief executive noted that the 
panels are too cautious about possible legal implications that 
may arise from the their actions thus slowing their conduct of 
the peace process. Let me make it very clear that the objective 
of the peace talks is to stop the violence and the bloodshed, 
while maintaining our traditional and permanent position of not 
compromising Philippine sovereignty, the president reminded the 
group. To achieve that objective I think we should not be too 
legalistic at this point in time, the important thing is to 
accomplish the first step which is to stop the violence, he said. 
  Some of the panel members expressed concern that the 
Congress 
might question in the future, the legality or the 
constitutionality of their decisions. However, Ramos gave them 
the authority to pursue whatever they think will expedite the 
conduct of the peace process, saying that whatever legal 
questions might arise could probably be resolved later on. 
  The president also assessed that the government's efforts to 
stop [words indistinct] long and lasting peace have borne 
significant results. I think we are achieving the result that 
we want which is the reduction of violence but we should not 
lose sight of the fact that although violence has been reduced, 
it is a fact that there are still people dying out there in the 
field, he pointed out. 
  The chief executive called on every local government 
official 
to fully support the initiatives of the peace panels. He 
specifically asked the local officials in Mindanao to coordinate 
their actions with the group of former Ambassador Yan. He 
received reports that certain governors and other local 
officials are making moves without consulting the Yan panel. 
There are still possible clash points and if we are not 
careful, they might undermine the peace process he said. 
  During the meeting the president was briefed by the panels 
on 
the progress of their respective peace talks. Tadiar said that 
his group will have an informal meeting with the RAM-SFP-YOU 
[Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabayan; Nationalist 
Revolutionary Alliance-Soldiers of the Filipino People-Young 
Officers Union] which is tentatively scheduled tomorrow, 23 
March. He said the meeting will be the first after the talks 
stalled last December. 
  Yan reported that his panel and the MNLF [Moro National 
Liberation Front] mixed-committee are scheduled to resume their 
meeting tentatively on 4 to 6 April. He said the venues are 
still being worked out. 
  Dee said that the National Democratic Front [NDF] has 
backtracked from the planned Vietnam exploratory talks because 
of their demand for the withdrawal of Executive Order 125. 
Executive Order 125 signed by the president on 13 September of 
last year defined the approach and administrative structures for 
the government's comprehensive peace efforts. They also 
demanded that preliminary talks be conducted in Europe prior to 
the Vietnam meet last 16 March. The Dee panel sent a letter to 
the NDF pressing for the meeting and informing the leadership of 
a possible amnesty proclamation. They have yet to respond to 
our letter, Dee said.

  [Text] The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabayan 
[Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance -- RAM] will not surrender 
light anti-tank weapons and other high powered fire arms in its 
possession despite a declaration by the government of a general 
amnesty, its leader Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan said yesterday. 
  In an interview with the Manila Standard, Honasan reiterated 
the RAM's stand against an amnesty proclamation by the 
government for all rebels, opting instead for a "comprehensive 
peace settlement" so that substantive issues addressed by the 
RAM during the peace negotiations can be fully resolved. 
  "Even with an amnesty proclamation, we will not surrender 
any 
of our weapons. We will only turn over once a peace settlement 
is reached," Honasan said. Earlier, the RAM claimed it still 
possesses more than 30 light anti-tank weapons and several 
high-powered arms, stressing that the movement is far from being 
a spent force as the government alleged. 
  Honasan said that aside from the RAM's considerable 
firepower, its influence over the armed forces remains and 
continues to pervade down the line even over new graduates of 
the Philippine Military Academy. 
  He said the "civilian component" of RAM has increased and 
even exceeded its military component. 
  Despite claims it still has the strength and the manpower, 
Honasan said the RAM does not rely on any outside funding from 
abroad, but on its "support within the AFP [Armed Forces of the 
Philippines]." 
  The RAM has indefinitely suspended peace talks with the 
government since December last year, after Honasan raised issues 
which he said should be resolved first before the negotiations 
can continue. 
  The issues being questioned by the RAM include the arrest 
and 
continued detention of six RAM members by the military, 
apprehended for illegal possession of ammunitions while the 
peace negotiations were ongoing. The RAM also asked the 
government for a reorganization in the armed forces and to allow 
members of the RAM panel to the peace talks to carry firearms 
for their security. 
  The movement has addressed several talking points in its 
peace talks with the government: political reforms, economic 
reforms, electoral reforms, a campaign to weed out graft and 
corruption in the government and the implementation of a "true" 
land reform program. 
  Before the suspension of the talks, the RAM and government 
peace panels concentrated discussions on the implementation of 
electoral reforms, in preparation for the forthcoming 1995 
elections. The RAM wanted the government to "rotate" officials 
in Comelec [Commission on Elections] nationwide as an initial 
step to eliminating irregularities and fraud in the coming polls. 
  In pushing for a negotiated peace settlement instead of an 
amnesty proclamation, Honasan said a declaration of a general 
amnesty will only preempt the issues being addressed by the RAM 
and government peace panels during the talks. 
  "If you declare an amnesty, that's it. But what we are 
pushing for is the implementation of the reforms that we want. 
People will tend to forget that there are still issues to be 
resolved once an amnesty proclamation is announced," Honasan 
said. 
  Meanwhile, President Ramos said yesterday a presidential 
panel has not yet completed the draft of the second amnesty 
proclamation covering members of all insurgent forces. 
  The president told his weekly press conference that the 
proposal draft is still being refined by the panel composed of 
officials of the Department of Interior and Local Government, 
Department of National Defense and Office of the Presidential 
Adviser on the Peace Process. 
  The draft of the amnesty proclamation was supposed to be 
submitted to the president last 11 March. But apparently 
several thorny issues have not yet been resolved by the 
president and his advisers. 
  Among the unresolved issues are whether the amnesty should 
be 
unconditional or conditional, what common crimes can be absorbed 
by the crime of rebellion, and the implications of declaring a 
second round of amnesty on the ongoing peace negotiations with 
the various rebel groups.

  [Text] The AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] Civil 
Relations Service (CRS) yesterday revealed the propaganda war 
between two rival factions in the underground movement. 
  The CRS said the word war is raging between the Stalinist 
and 
the breakaway revisionist blocs. The Stalinist group is 
reportedly controlled by Jose Ma. Sison, self-exiled Communist 
Party of the Philippines (CPP) chairman. 
  The CRS said based on seized CPP documents, the Stalinist 
bloc has intensified a re-education and indoctrination campaign 
to counter the headway by the other faction. 
  Sison's followers accused members of the rival faction of 
involving themselves with "the bourgeoisie proletariat" instead 
of aligning with peasant workers and masses in the countryside. 
  They assailed the tendency of the revisionists to sympathize 
with the economic policies of President Ramos as "tantamount to 
the alliance with the government." 
  In the Southern Tagalog Region, the tug-of-war shows the 
extent of the schism in the communist movement, the CRS added.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "International Terrorism"] </F>
  [Text] The accident involving a motorcycle fortunately 
prevented terrorists from carrying out a bomb attack with their 
truck. The Israeli Embassy was probably the target of the bomb 
attack. The accident forced the terrorists to desert their 
truck, which was eventually moved to Lumpini Police Station. 
  Inestimable damage and tragedy would have resulted if the 
terrorists were able to carry out their mission. What prevented 
the tragedy was the accident, not the ability of the officials 
concerned. 
  Police and security officials and questioning of witnesses 
indicate initially that the bombing attempt was the work of 
international terrorists, possibly Arabs who seek to avenge the 
Hebron massacre. 
  Among the observations concerning the bombing attempt are: 
How did immigration officials allow these terrorists to enter 
the country? Is the intelligence network sound and is its 
coordination with foreign intelligence agencies efficient? 
  True, because Thailand is a democratic country and tourism 
is 
a major revenue earner, its check on arriving foreign tourists 
is rather loose. But this should not mean that entries are 
permitted without checks or for selfish reasons. 
  Another observation is: Why did officials of the Lumpini 
Police Station leave the explosive-laden truck unchecked for six 
days? This delay deprived others of any chance of a timely 
arrest of suspects. Was there a written record of the accident? 
Was there a neglect of duty? 
  Although the cold war has ended, disputes among nations have 
continued more vigorously in some places, such as in the former 
Soviet Union, the former Yugoslavia, and in the Middle East. 
International terrorism has not ceased. The countries who have 
lax security will fall prey first.

  [Text] Soldiers will always dwell on the possibility of a 
coup d'etat and it is impossible to stop them, according to 
Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut yesterday. 
  Gen. Chawalit, a former Army commander-in-chief, made the 
comment while talking with reporters about the conflict between 
the military-dominated Senate, the House of Representatives and 
the Government over the constitutional amendment issue. 
  "Civil servants (military) are valuable. They are 
responsible 
for the country. 
  "Whenever they feel the country is about to come crashing 
down, they will be the first to act. We can't blame them," he 
said. 
  Gen. Chawalit said it was good for senators from the 
military 
wing to band together and express their opposition to the 
amendments. 
  They are helping to create unity in the thinking and 
understanding of the Upper House. 
  The minister, asked if the move could lead to a coup, said: 
  "Some people still look at it that way because they still 
have bad dreams." 
  He insisted there was no conflict hetween the two Houses 
over 
the amendment issue. 
  "They are just speaking differently," he sald. 
  Both MPs and senators are responsible and adult and know 
what 
they should do when the time comes, he said' 
  Gen. Chawalit said people were confused about the amendments 
but this did not mean there would be any problems. 
  The political situation at the moment is "strange," he said, 
because never before have senators united to oppose the 
Government. 
  "This time some 200 of them are united. But that's not bad." 
  The Interior Minister said the situation in Parliament 
contained an element of conflict and this made people feel 
uncomfortable.

  [Excerpt] Army chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit yesterday lashed 
out at Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut, saying the former 
army chief is "afraid of his own shadow" and people should 
ignore him. 
  Gen Wimon was apparently upset about Gen Chawalit's remark 
on 
Friday that another military coup d'etat cannot be ruled out. 
  Asked about conflicts between the Senate and the Lower House 
of Parliament over proposed charter amendments, Gen Chawalit 
said that soldiers would be first to come out if they felt the 
country is threatened. 
  However, he denied having said this the next day. 
  Speaking at Don Muang Airport on his return from India, Gen 
Wimon said that people should not take any notice of what Gen 
Chawalit says. 
  He said Gen Chawalit is afraid of his own shadow and tends 
to 
have nightmares. 
  Deputy House Speaker Thawin Phraison said he is optimistic 
that Thai soldiers will not stage another coup, because if they 
did the country would greatly suffer. 
  Mr Thawin, who is a Phalang Tham Party (PDP) executive, said 
he was "stunned" by Gen Chawalit's remark, which was also 
heavily attacked yesterday by a meeting of about 200 
Confederation for Democracy (CFD) members from across the 
country in Bangkok. 
  Key CFD members said Gen Chawalit should make more 
constructive comments. 
  Somsak Kosaisuk, a CFD leader, said Gen Chawalit should not 
have made such an ambiguous remark. 
  "I don't think soldiers will (stage another coup), because 
they are patriotic. 
  "They would not do something that would damage the country, 
and even if they did, they would be opposed by all 
democracy-loving organisations," he claimed. 
  Dr San Hatthirat said there should be no more coups because 
military leaders have shown a clear commitment to democracy. 
  The best way of preventing a coup is government 
decentralisation, he added. 
  Dr Weng Tochirakan said that although Gen Chawalit has the 
right to make such remarks, he should be more helpful. 
  "I think that no matter how bad a problem is, it should be 
solved through democratic means. Nobody should talk about a 
coup carelessly. 
  "If there is another coup, people all over the country would 
oppose it. Thailand's past coups have done enough damage to the 
country. There should be no more," he said. 
  Gen Chawalit was army chief prior to joining the Chatchai 
Chunhawan government briefly as deputy prime minister. [passage

  [Text] Talking to SIAM POST on 19 March, Army spokesman 
Colonel Phalangkun Klahan confirmed that there will be no coup 
as Interior Minister General Chawalit Yongchaiyut has warned. 
  The spokesman said that Army Commander General Wimon 
Wongwanit has stated a clear policy that the Army does not 
interfere in politics and everyone is trying his best to perform 
his own duty. The Army wants to see affection, unity, and 
understanding among various sectors. The Army chief has urged 
everyone to regard the interests of the people and the country 
as major goals. 
  "We never want to have conflicts with others," said the Army 
spokesman. Asked if Gen. Chawalit, as a former Army commander 
and Armed Forces supreme commander, may have received some 
information about it, Col. Phalangkun declined to comment. 
  As for opinions of military officers on this issue, an Army 
officer commanding military forces, said that Chawalit's remark 
was meant to divert public attention from the problem of the 
deteriorating image of politicians, although he knows very well 
that at present there is no way the military can successfully 
stage a coup. Today, the military does not even think about a 
coup and Gen. Chawalit should know this well. 
  "Chawalit can carry out his political activities, but he 
should think about peace for the country and the people and also 
his younger brothers in the Army. At present, we are all right. 
We would be angry if another had said this, but the speaker is 
Chawalit, a military man and former leader of the Army. But we 
do not feel well at all about what he has said," the 
high-ranking military officer noted. 
  He emphasized that everybody knows that a coup will be 
impossible in the near future, but afterward it is not certain 
because it depends on the situation. 
  Meanwhile, during an interview with reporters in Nonthaburi 
Province, when asked about a coup, Gen. Chawalit only replied: 
"Who said?" and said nothing more.

<F P=106> [Article by Vichet Siritha: "Once Again US Informality </F>
Charms Away APEC Doubts"] 
  [Text] Judging by comments from some ASEAN members, there 
was considerable suspicion prior to the Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) meeting on Saturday over the motives of 
larger members. 
  The suspicions were directed at the United States and 
despite 
Washington's denials, the US was perceived as preparing to 
exploit the occasion to exert pressure on various countries, 
including Thailand, to open their financial services markets. 
  ASEAN delegates therefore resisted anything that might be 
construed as commitments. APEC finance ministers' meetings 
should not be "institutionalised" and the document issued at the 
end of Saturday's meeting should be a "chairman's statement", 
not a "joint declaration". 
  In the end, no binding commitments emerged but even 
Malaysia's finance minister and deputy prime minister Anwar 
Ibrahim was reported as saying the meeting was a success. 
  In several respects, the Honolulu finance ministers' meeting 
was a repeat of last November's informal APEC summit in Seattle 
when US President Bill Clinton (with the help of a media circles 
totalling 2,000) charmed away all the doubts of ASEAN and other 
Asian countries. 
  This time it was US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's turn. 
Mr Clinton, in checked shirt and leather jacket, had brought 
bright sunshine to a traditionally rainy Seattle autumn. 
Similarly in Hawaii, Mr Bentsen, in his red-mauve shirt and 
deep yellow slacks, succeeded in calming a 40 mph tempest so 
that the finance ministers could play golf and speak to the 
Press standing casually on a lawn with coconut trees and the 
ocean as a backdrop. 
  Even reporters were instructed to dress casually, and their 
press cards were printed in a seablue with pictures of the 
Hawaiian islands and bright green coconut trees. 
  The result was just what the United States wanted. All APEC 
ministers turned up as invited -- even the Malaysians -- and the 
informality and total absence of any of the feared pressure 
turned the event into a highly successful confidence-building 
exercise. Mr Bentsen carefully avoided contentious issues. 
  As Thai finance permanent secretary Aran Thammano put it the 
United States has plenty of other forums where it can be 
aggressive such as meetings of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade and the World Bank. 
  Now, however, after only one meeting of APEC finance 
ministers, the group faces a problem: Where can it go from here? 
It cannot continue to hold casual get-togethers at this level 
showing no concrete results, without reinforcing accusations 
that it is a waste of time. 
  But if concrete results are the objective, then controversy 
may be difficult to avoid. At the same time, the coordination 
of macroeconomic policy might not be a realistic objective for 
so diverse a membership. 
  This time, the US was not alone in agreeing that the meeting 
took place at all was in itself a concrete result. Mr Aran said 
he found it beneficial to meet his counterparts and other 
ministers from APEC countries to establish a personal 
relationship as a foundation for future negotiations. 
  "Institutionalization" turned out to be the most 
controversial word at the meeting. ASEAN was at the centre of 
the discussion and even within ASEAN the cracks were scarcely 
covered up. 
  Indonesia and Malaysia were most strongly against 
"institutionalisation", which mainly meant committing APEC's 
finance ministers to regular annual meetings, and generally 
tightening a loose relationship. 
  Thailand's position was more relaxed. Finance Minister 
Tharin Nimmanhemin said that institutionalisation might be 
possible since the economies of APEC represent one of the most 
important economic centres of the world. 
  He had no objection to the idea of closer cooperation on 
macroeconomic policy and added that by his definition, the mere 
fact that they were meeting was already a step towards 
institutionalisation. 
  ASEAN members quickly closed ranks, fearing that if it 
remained divided it would weaken its position as a major group 
representing six of APEC's 17 countries. 
  The ASEAN position was informally defined at a dinner hosted 
by Mr Tharin, representing Thailand's current chairmanship of 
ASEAN. For reasons of protocol, he stressed that the gathering 
was simply a "chat" and not a meeting. 
  Also emerging from the ASEAN dinner was the group's 
opposition to a joint declaration and preference for a 
non-binding chairman's statement -- again with Indonesia and 
Malaysia assuming the strongest positions. 
  According to Thai sources, this made ASEAN appear 
intransigent and unwilling to cooperate, particularly in the 
eyes of Australian Treasurer Ralph Willis, who sought an 
unscheduled meeting with Mr Tharin. 
  The result was a linguistic compromise that satisfied 
ASEAN's 
doubters even if most nondiplomats would have difficulty in 
working out the difference -- the final document was neither a 
joint declaration nor a chairman's statement but a "joint 
statement". 
  ASEAN's linguists also succeeded in changing a reference to 
"integrating" economies into "interlinking" economies. 
  ASEAN's concerns are not difficult to understand. When 
joining a body with such large partners, smaller members are 
naturally suspicious of being dominated, particularly at a time 
when trade issues are becoming more contentious. 
  For many in Asia, the feeling remains that APEC should 
remain 
a consultative forum. The smaller countries believe that 
anything beyond that would leave them vulnerable to pressure 
from larger members. 
  The United States understood this and tried its best to 
avoid 
pressuring fellow-members. It has achieved another step in its 
objective to draw closer to what it sees as an Asia Pacific 
community. Washington estimates that by the year 2000, even 
excluding Japan, seven million Asian households will have an 
income comparable to middle-income Americans. 
  For the future, the question remains for APEC finance 
ministers whether their meetings can achieve more substantive 
results. More importantly is the question of whether APEC and 
ASEAN organisations can remain unified.

  [Text] A source at the Foreign Ministry told PRACHACHAT 
THURAKIT that the ministry is studying the establishment of a 
new mechanism to promote trade and economic cooperation between 
Thailand and the United States since the existing one, the Joint 
Committee on Trade set up under the 1990 agreement, does not 
work. No meeting has been held over the past three years and 
this can be attributed to the failure of this joint committee. 
  According to the source, the idea to set up a new apparatus 
to promote U.S.-Thai economic and trade cooperation was based on 
a discussion between Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and President 
Bill Clinton when they were attending the APEC [Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation] meeting in Seattle in November last year. 
At that time, the Thai prime minister proposed the 
establishment of an apparatus to coordinate cooperation between 
the Thai and U.S. private sector. President Clinton expressed 
interest in the idea and promised to study the Thai prime 
minister's proposal. 
  The source says: "Shortly after that, David Lambertson, the 
U.S. ambassador to Thailand, and John Finney, chief of the 
Thai-Burmese section of the U.S. State Department, had a meeting 
with Sarasin Wiraphon, director general of the America and South 
Pacific Department. Sarasin was informed that the United States 
agreed with the Thai prime minister's proposal on the 
establishment of an apparatus for cooperation between the Thai 
and U.S. private sector. The United States also proposed 
meetings of officials from both countries to work out the 
structure of the new apparatus. Both sides also agreed to hold 
a meeting in March to discuss this project." 
  The Foreign Ministry has two options to propose concerning 
the establishment of a mechanism to promote Thai-U.S. economic 
and trade cooperation. First is the establishment of the 
mechanism to coordinate Thai-U.S. cooperation. Second, based on 
a proposal by Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, is 
the establishment of a forum for discussion with the 
participation of agencies from both countries such as the 
foreign ministries, commerce ministries, and the USTR [U.S. 
Trade Representative]. This will ensure the forum has a power 
for decision making and implementing measures. 
  The source says: "The Foreign Ministry is speeding up work 
on the format and structure of a mechanism to promote Thai-U.S. 
economic and trade cooperation based on the two guidelines. 
Moreover, it also is taking into consideration the existing 
apparatus under bilateral agreements, such as the Joint 
Commercial Commission, American Chamber of Commerce, 
Thai-American Chamber of Commerce, U.S.-Thai Leadership Council, 
and even the U.S.-ASEAN Council for Business and Technology. 
The ministry wants to find the most appropriate proposal to 
present at a meeting with U.S. officials in March." 
  At the seminar on U.S.-Thai Business Workshops held in New 
York in October last year, Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan 
proposed the establishment of a council for economic cooperation 
between the Thai and U.S. Government and business sectors. No 
progress, however, has been made.

  [Text] During his official visit to the Republic of Poland 
between 15 to 17 March, Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai 
Phanitchaphak held talks with Polish leaders to discuss ways of 
promoting economic, trade, investment, scientific, and 
technological cooperation as well as strengthening bilateral 
relations in all fields. During the talks, Poland tried to find 
ways of increasing its exports, particularly capital goods, to 
Thailand to help reduce its trade deficit with Thailand. The 
Thai side informed Poland that Thailand needs capital goods to 
develop its infrastructure. However, Poland still lacks 
experience in penetrating the Thai market and does not have good 
access to market information on the private sector. The Thai 
side is willing to help Poland in this. 
  The two sides agreed to increase their bilateral trade 
volume 
by setting up information centers. The two sides also discussed 
the possibility of bartering capital goods. The Thai side 
stressed that barter trade may be carried out for some products 
on a reciprocal basis. Both sides agreed to hold a meeting of 
the joint trade commission this year. 
  The Thai side also explained to Poland about the reduction 
of 
its defense budget and its need for military hardware. In this 
regard, Poland might be able to sell its products to Thailand 
for military training and agricultural purposes. 
  The two sides agreed to enter joint ventures to produce 
goods 
for export to third countries. In particular, there are 
possibilities for setting up an aircraft factory in Thailand for 
exports to Asian countries and for joint fishing and marine 
product processing ventures. In addition, Poland may 
participate in projects to build a communications network 
linking Indochinese countries, the quadrangle economic 
development project, and the south growth triangle project. 
Thailand is willing to support Poland's participation in 
economic and infrastructure development projects in the country 
because Thailand still needs more new roads and an airport.

  [Text] Thailand and China have agreed on cooperation with 
civil lawsuits and arbitration between the two countries. 
Minister of Justice Sawai Phatthano says he had reached the 
agreement with his Chinese counterpart during his recent visit 
to China. Minister Sawai says according to the agreement, Thai 
nationals in China will be under the justice authority 
designated under the same category and at the same level as the 
Chinese authority. In addition, Thai nationals in China will 
now have the right to fight a lawsuit against individuals in 
China. 
  He says Thailand is the 18th country to sign such an 
agreement with China. Earlier Thailand and China have signed an 
extradition agreement. The minister says he and his Chinese 
counterpart have agreed to promote arbitration as a means to 
settle disputes over marine trade and transportation between the 
countries. The minister of justice says that for the 19 years 
of Thai-Chinese diplomatic relations, their cooperation in laws 
should be made to support other ties.

  [Text] Vietnam -- The Bank of Thailand aims at a more 
important role in helping improve Vietnamese bank operations, 
its first step to help develop the communist country's economy. 
Vietnam's state bank governor welcomed the idea during Wichit's 
visit to the country last week. 
  Wichit Suphinit, central bank governor, said Vietnam banks 
are specialized in industries and lack financial expertise to 
cope with international investors flooding into the country. 
  Its specialist banks are involved with foreign trade, 
industrial development, construction and agriculture. 
  The Thai central bank must first help Vietnam convert its 
banks into commercial facilities through the four-year training 
programmes it is offering the country's financial sector, said 
Wichit. Upcoming commercial banks will then be able to institute 
local and foreign loans to help bolster the country's economy, 
he added. 
  Under the programmes, Thailand will receive Vietnamese 
banking officials for training in finance and stock market 
development. 
  Vietnamese banks will be assisted in drafting banking 
regulations for loans, cheque clearing, promissory note 
issuance, bond issuance, loan repayments and share certificate 
transactions, said Wichit. 
  The programmes will also address bankruptcy law, he added. 
  Wichit does not foresee Vietnamese banks as a threat to 
Thailand's finance sector once they acquire commercial exposure. 
  "Thai banks still have to accomplish many things for further 
development. For example, our form filings have to be upgraded 
to meet the European standards." 
  Although Vietnam's banks will not pose competition for Thai 
banks, they will encourage our institutions to develop further, 
stressed Dr Som Chatusiphithak president of Thai Bankers 
Association. 
  Vietnam, a promising investment area due to its abundant 
resources and low wage labour, recently launched several schemes 
to develop its financial sector. Aside from bank development, 
the country is planning a stock exchange for next year. 
  Vietnam alone may not be able to set up an exchange due to 
high investment required for the entity. Formation of the 
bourse, however, would help large companies raise cheap funds, 
said Wichit. 
  Prior to the bourse's establishment, Vietnam should upgrade 
its private and public organizations to meet listing 
qualifications. The country is currently drafting stock exchange 
regulations. 
  A developed banking industry will support exchange 
procedures 
through loans to companies. As a result, companies will improve 
performance and qualify for listing. 
  The central banker earlier said Vietnamese firms will be 
given listings on the Stock Exchange of Thailand if they meet 
requirements of the Thai bourse and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. However, Wichit does not expect the Vietnamese 
exchange will encourage fund shifts from Thailand to Vietnam. 
  Vietnam has applied for a seat in the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Wichit dismissed the 
possibility that Asean's economic growth will drop once the 
country is admitted. 
  Once Vietnam is an Asean member, Thailand will have an edge 
over other Asean members due to the cultural and geographical 
proximity.

  [Text] Hungary has urged Thai commercial banks to open 
their representative offices or invest in setting up commercial 
banks in that country. 
  According to the Department of Information, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, to invest in setting up a bank in Hungary 
requires a capital of at least U.S. $10 million. Hungary agreed 
to consider easing various constraints to pave the way for the 
setting up of branch offices in Hungary by Thai commercial 
banks. The country also wants to sell several industrial 
products to Thailand, such as railway tracks, crop godowns, and 
cooling system cables. Thailand asked Hungary to buy more Thai 
products in return. 
  During the recent visit to Hungary by Deputy Prime Minister 
Suphachai Phanitchaphak, Thailand proposed that Hungary use 
tapioca as an ingredient for animal feed production. Hungary 
asked Thailand's advice for the use of tapioca in animal feed 
production. The country also agreed to serve as an agent to 
bring frozen pork from Thailand for further distribution to the 
commonwealth independent state.

  [Text] BANGKOK -- The Army is providing support to families 
of Khmer Rouge soldiers who cross the border into Thailand 
fleeing attacks from the Cambodian government, Defense Minister 
Gen Wichit Sukmak said yesterday. 
  However, that support is strictly for humanitarian purposes 
only, he said. 
  Thailand will repatriate them at the appropriate time," Gen 
Wichit told reporters gathered at Government House. 
  The defense chief said the government is depending on 
soldiers to do their jobs responsibly in order to maintain 
security along the Thai-Cambodia border under the current round 
of heavy fighting. 
  "The news reports describing the current situation are still 
confusing," he said. "It is not certain whether the government 
has captured the Khmer Rouge headquarters in Pailin as reported. 
I think the Khmer Rouge will have to resort to guerrilla 
warfare tactics or face being overrun by the Cambodian 
government troops." 
  The fighting between Khmer Rouge troops and the Cambodian 
forces intensified Saturday, resulting in the apparent 
government capture of Pailin, a former Khmer Rouge stronghold 
and a major source of gems and timber which the rebel forces 
sold to underwrite their operations. 
  Situated in the northwestern part of Cambodia, Pailin 
borders 
Thailand at Chanthaburi province. When there is heavy fighting, 
Khmer Rouge families -- mostly women, children and elderly 
people -- flood Thailand's eastern soils at Ban Phakkat of Pong 
Nam Ron district in Chanthaburi. 
  Both groups are still engaged in heavy battle. The 
government dispatched soldiers to try and wipe out the Khmer 
Rouge forces, and the rebels have returned to the guerrilla 
warfare tactics which have served them well in the past. The 
sound of gunfire can be heard at the border from time to time, 
and many Thai businessmen who run gem operations in Pailin have 
returned home. 
  Supreme Command spokesman Anuson Kritsanaserani said in a 
press conference that he received reliable information that the 
Cambodian government has indeed captured Pailin. Approximately 
25,000 Khmer Rouge family members have poured across the border 
into Thailand. 
  "We sent Thai soldiers to help these refugees for 
humanitarian reasons," he said. "We treat refugees the same as 
we have always treated them. If the situation quiets down and 
returns to normal, we will send them all back home.

  [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed says he will attend 
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC, informal summit in 
Jakarta in November, and again stressed the need for the forum 
not to be institutionalized. 
  The prime minister, who skipped the first meeting in Seattle 
last year and caused dissatisfaction among some APEC members, 
said he would be attending the summit since it was decided by 
APEC. The inaugural summmit held in Seattle was initiated by 
United States President Bill Clinton. 
  Speaking at the press conference after delivering a keynote 
address at the 10th International General Meeting of the Pacific 
Economic Cooperation Council in Kuala Lumpur, Datuk Sri Dr. 
Mahathir reiterated that APEC should conduct informal meetings. 
The prime minister said APEC should continue to exist as an 
informal meeting and should not institutionalized its meetings 
and have regular programs for a smooth [word indistinct]. But 
the forum should not bind its members and that these objectives 
should seek for members to know each other and understand their 
constructive point of views. 
  To a question, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said the 
Malaysian-initiated East Asia Economic Caucus, EAEC, is not 
institutionalized and that it is a forum to discuss common 
problems among countries in the region.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Dr. 
Mahathir Mohamed hopes North Korea will allow United Nations 
officials to inspect its nuclear sites, currently a subject of 
tension between the two Koreas. 
  The prime minister, however, suggested that an appropriate 
approach should be adopted to facilitate the inspection. The 
approach must be one where they (North Koreans) must not feel 
they are being ordered to do this and that, he [words 
indistinct] comment on the current stand-off between North and 
South Korea on the nuclear issue. 
  South Korea Monday said it would resume preparations for war 
games with the United States in the face of a renewed threat 
from the North's to withdraw from a global pact limiting the 
spread of nuclear arms. 
  Speaking to reporters at the 10th International General 
Meeting of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council here, Dr. 
Mahathir said he did not think North Korea wanted to have a 
nuclear war. 
  I don't think they want to have a war at all, he said.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 02 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Prime 
Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said Tuesday Malaysia would 
consider reviewing its exclusion of British firms for new 
government contracts if the British media ceased reporting lies 
about the country. 
  If you stop telling lies, then we might retrieve the die, he 
replied to a question on his letter to the FINANCIAL TIMES of 
London in which he stated that the die is cast on the issue. 
  He also made clear that the ban only covered future 
government contracts and did not apply to the private sector or 
other economic activities. 
  Speaking to reporters at the 10th International General 
Meeting of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council here, Dr. 
Mahathir said taking legal action against the British newspapars 
concerned would not get us anywhere. 
  It will only result in the British papers having a field day 
reporting all kinds of mud which they are very good at, he added. 
  The Malaysian Government decided to stop awarding new 
contracts to British firms following a barrage of wild 
allegations by the British media implying that its leaders were 
corrupt.

  [Text] The deputy governor of Siem Reap, Kang Heang, 
reported yesterday that a group of fifty Khmer Rouge troops on 
16 March raided a wood factory near the province and killed one 
policeman. The factory is located about 15 km from Angkor Wat 
and the owner was not present when the factory was raided. The 
Khmer Rouge took all valuables at the factory and continued 
robbing other people in the vicinity. The bandits spent about 
45 minutes looting until government troops arrived and exchanged 
fire with them. A Khmer Rouge soldier was wounded and two 
houses were destroyed. The bandits fled southward heading for 
Tonle Sap and robbed people along the way. 
  Relief officials in Siem Reap are worried about their 
security because it is possible that the group will return as 
government soldiers are preparing operations to flush out the 
Khmer Rouge from Angkor Wat because their presence affects 
tourism. There was also a report from Phnom Penh that 
government troops are preparing to take the Khmer Rouge 
headquarters in Pailin. 
  Major General Por Vannak, a high-level military officer of 
the Cambodian Army, said in Ratanakmondol, a government 
stronghold about 40 km east of the Khmer Rouge command post, 
that government forces were only two km away from the Khmer 
Rouge stronghold. Maj. Gen. Por Vannak said the Khmer Rouge 
stronghold had been encircled. A private of the government 
Army, Mei Tit, said many houses in Pailin raised white flags 
yesterday when the government forces were about to launch 
attacks on the first day of the operation to take Pailin. 
  The Cambodian Government issued a warning several months in 
advance that it would launch an operation to take Pailin because 
the Khmer Rouge refused to negotiate in order to end the 
decade-long civil war.

  [Text] Vienna, March 21 (YONHAP) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] board of governors overwhelmingly 
adopted a resolution Monday referring the North Korean nuclear 
dispute to the United Nations Security Council. 
  The vote on the resolution, sponsored by 17 board members 
including the United States, Britain, Germany and Russia, was 25 
for, one against and five abstentions. 
  China, whose position on the issue had attracted the most 
interest, abstained along with India, Indonesia, Brazil and 
Lebanon. 
  The only opposing vote was cast by Libya. Cuba and Syria did 
not take part in the voting. 
  The resolution contained wording that said the IAEA will 
notify the UN Security Council of the matter. 
  However, it is believed the resolution is more than an act 
of 
notification as it indirectly urges the Security Council to 
implement countermeasures, observers said. 
  The resolution expresses the most serious concern ever by 
the 
IAEA board of governors over the possibility that North Korea 
has diverted nuclear material for other than stated purposes. 
  It asks IAEA Director-General Hans Blix to report the 
resolution not only to all IAEA members but also the United 
Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. 
  The resolution specifically mentions that the IAEA could not 
prove that North Korea had not used nuclear material for nuclear 
weapons or nuclear explosive devices. The observers deemed it 
significant that the IAEA has used the terms "nuclear weapons" 
and "nuclear explosive devices" for the first time in its 
resolution on the North Korean issue. 
  The resolution, consisting of seven items, expresses regret 
that the IAEA was unable to fulfill the Security Council's 
request to resolve the dispute because of North Korea's 
uncooperative attitude. 
  It recalls that the Security Council instructed Blix last 
May 
to report back to the council on how the issue was progressing, 
thus indirectly requesting that the Security Council eventually 
deliberate countermeasures. 
  At the same time, the resolution urged North Korea once 
again 
to allow unfettered IAEA inspections, implement the nuclear 
safeguards agreement and fulfill its obligations as a signatory 
to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  The IAEA said the North Korean problem will remain a major 
pending issue and warned that, if Pyongyang does not fulfill its 
obligations under the nuclear safeguards agreement, it will take 
follow-up steps in accordance with its charter including 
disqualification and suspension of technology cooperation. 
  In his opening report to the board meeting, Blix said 
inspection of the radiochemical laboratory was a must and North 
Korea had already agreed to allow it. 
  Despite its earlier agreement, North Korea refused to let 
IAEA inspectors check the laboratory, making it impossible to 
determine whether the Stalinist state had diverted nuclear 
material for non- peaceful purposes since the last inspection in 
February. 
  Blix warned that the IAEA would no longer remain silent on 
the issue. 
  The IAEA is ready to send experts again to check facilities 
they could not inspect last time. In order to do so, North 
Korea must offer the UN watchdog a clear commitment that it 
would allow all inspections. 
  The North Korean representative denounced the resolution, 
charging that the IAEA had reached a hasty and irrational 
conclusion and was putting unjust pressure on Pyongyang.

  [Text] With the North Korean nuclear issue approaching a 
confrontational phase, the UN Security Council has convened a 
closed-door meeting to tackle the North Korean nuclear issue 
right after the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] ended 
a special meeting of its Board of Governors. It has been 
learned that during the meeting, the UN Security Council will 
discuss ways to draw up prudent countermeasures, including 
sanctions, against North Korea. 
  Correspondent Nam Son-yon reports from UN Headquarters: 
  [Begin Nam recording] Assessing North Korea's nuclear issue 
as having reached a critical point in which the peace and 
security of not only the Korean peninsula but the world is 
threatened, the UN Security Council is drawing up prudent and 
versatile countermeasures, a well-informed source said. 
  The source said that after convening at 0530 AM [2030 GMT] 
Korean time to discuss the Bosnian crisis, the UN Security 
Council took up the U.S. request right after winding up 
discussions on the Bosnian matter. 
  The source added that the permanent members of the Security 
Council are expected to show a firm stance toward drawing up 
steps since the special meeting of IAEA Board of Governors 
adopted a resolution by an overwhelming majority and North Korea 
continues to make war-provocative outbursts while neglecting to 
show a sincere attitude toward nuclear inspections. 
  The United States, taking China's stance into account, is 
also expected to persuade other permanent members to adopt a 
resolution warning of sanctions within this week. 
  The permanent members, however, will adhere to its basic 
stance that the nuclear issue should be resolved peacefully 
since the IAEA wants additional inspections and the United 
States has not closed the door for dialogue with North Korea, 
and will deliberate fully on settlement of the matter. [end

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 (YONHAP) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa instructed the cabinet on Tuesday to prepare 
for an emergency as the United Nations Security Council ponders 
economic sanctions against North Korea. 
  Hosokawa told the cabinet that he is closely watching 
international efforts to deal with the North Korean nuclear 
dispute. He said, "President Kim Yong-sam is going to visit 
Japan from March 24, and we should keep an eye on the situation 
for seven to 10 days. We must make every preparation for an 
emergency." 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a press 
conference in the morning that Japan should exchange information 
with South Korea and Japan and act prudently. He acknowledged 
that working-level officials are studying ways to restrict 
remittance by ethnic Koreans in Japan to North Korea and 
prohibit North Korean ships from calling at Japanese ports. 
"But now is not yet the stage for the government to officially 
confirm that," he said. 
  On the military front, Defense Minister Kazuo Aichi 
instructed the Self-Defense Forces to reinforce security as 
tension rises in Northeast Asia. 
  Aichi told the press after the cabinet meeting that Japan is 
strengthening acquisition of information related to the North 
Korean nuclear dispute. 
  Tokyo is also preparing for a trade embargo in anticipation 
of a U.N. decision against the North Koreans. A senior 
government official said that in order to implement a 
full-fledged trade embargo against North Korea, the government 
will need to revise the enforcement regulations of trade-related 
and other laws. The Japanese Government is working on such 
revision, he said. 
  It would be difficult to prohibit remittance to North Korea, 
he said, but "the government should take every possible step. 
We will try to decide on prohibition (of remittance) as soon as 
possible." 
  He emphasized that Tokyo should conduct itself in a cool 
manner because if North Korea has succeeded in making nuclear 
weapons, it is highly likely they will be targeted at Japan. 
  Meanwhile, Japanese police checked all areas where President 
Kim Yong-sam is scheduled to pass by or stay on his visit to 
Japan this Thursday [24 March]. The Japanese police plan to 
establish a special comprehensive security headquarters, and 
about 16,000 policemen will be deployed to beef up security 
around Haneda airport, the Diet and the guest house.

  [Text] Australia has reiterated its backing for 
international efforts over North Korea's refusal to allow full 
international inspections of its nuclear sites. 
  Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans says Australia 
supports 
any action the United Nations Security Council may consider 
necessary in the matter. Senator Evans told the Australian 
Parliament that this week's decision by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency to refer the matter to the Security Council is a 
measure of how seriously the internatioanal community is 
treating the issue. 
  Sen. Evans also revealed Australia had expressed its 
concerns 
directly to North Korea. 
  [Begin Evans recording] We sent a message to North Korea 
ourselves last Friday (?with the idea) to allow IAEA inspections 
to be completed as a means of restarting the dialogue process. 
Regretably, the DPRK has not so far seen its interest as 
apparently being best served by proceeding in this fashion, but 
we hope, as it has on previous occasions when the situation, the 
pressure that is being mounted and the attitude of (?IAEA) and 
the attitude of the international community is clear, that North 
Korea will consider its position. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "No Thai Stops on Terror's Highway"] </F>
  [Text] We can all be thankful that the terrorist driving a 
bomb truck through Bangkok last week was not a very good driver. 
Had he not collided his deadly vehicle with a motorcycle he 
would have killed many more people than the one innocent truck 
driver. The explosives on his truck, set to go off at the flick 
of a battery switch, would have levelled an entire building or 
more, and killed and wounded people in a wide area. The bomb 
was assembled mostly from easily obtained common items. It was 
similar to the bombs that exploded last year at New York's World 
Trade Centre and before that at the Israeli Embassy in Argentina. 
  In short the bomb was practically a signature for 
international terrorists using Mideast grievances as their 
flimsy excuse for killing. Our security officials have rightly 
taken a cautious role and avoided assigning a motive for last 
week's abortive bomb attack. This will not stop the man in the 
street from speculation, nor should it prevent those same 
officials keeping a close watch on suspects. The means and 
methods of this unsuccessful attack clearly point to 
professional terrorists with international backing. 
Identification of the driver of the truck as of Mideast 
appearance provides at least some clue in the search for the 
criminals. 
  There must be a forthright, unyielding investigation of this 
truck bomb. In the first place, one Thai citizen has already 
been murdered. Although the attack itself was stopped thanks to 
the bungling of the driver coupled with the unwitting tenacity 
of a motorcycle taxi driver, the terrorist was clearly planning 
massive killing and destruction. Whether the target of this 
foreigner's attack was other foreigners, as seems likely, is not 
the point. The blast would have killed and injured more 
innocent Thai citizens as well as the foreign officials our 
authorities are pledged to protect. The worldwide publicity 
after a successful blast would have also done untold harm to the 
country's image. Despite its good relations with all sides in 
the Middle Eastern disputes, Thailand as a country would have 
thus become an innocent victim of international terrorism as 
much as have the unfortunate passengers on hijacked or bombed 
airliners. 
  International terror has seldom visited Bangkok. But when it 
has the results have been deadly. A Black September attack on 
the Israeli Embassy in 1972 ended peacefully after several days 
of tense negotiations. But since then, hijackings and attacks 
have cost several dozen innocent lives. Authorities pledged 
after the deadly 1988 Kuwait Air hijacking from Bangkok that 
anti-terrorism procedures would be tightened. During the Gulf 
War, when suspected terrorists were poised to make attacks in 
Bangkok, they were intercepted and sent packing. 
  Of course, there is no way that every act of terror can be 
detected and stopped. New York's blast and the recent attacks 
on London's Heathrow airport show that even the most 
security-conscious governments are helpless against the 
determined terrorist. But it is clearly imperative that police 
and other security officials continue to do their utmost to 
prevent such heinous acts. Few doubt that last week's giant 
bomb could not have been assembled without help from people 
other than the lone, and possibly suicidal, truck driver. 
Whether these helpers were foreign diplomats or private Thai or 
foreign citizens should not influence the strength of efforts to 
root out dangerous threats to our country. Diplomats involved 
in terrorism can and should be expelled. Those who hold no such 
special status, Thai or foreign, can be investigated and dealt 
with under the law. 
  There is a general belief -- whether true or not -- that on 
occasion our law-enforcement officers go easy on disputes 
between foreigners. At the personal level this may at times be 
the wisest course. But acts of great violence like that which 
would have been triggered by the truck bomb deserve full 
investigation and, if possible, direct action. Indeed, it is 
exactly Thailand and its citizens who have been wronged even 
during the spineless lead-up to last week's non-bombing. 
  There may be no fingerprints to identify positively the 
driver of the bomb truck or the murderer of an innocent Thai. 
But the fingerprints of international terror lie over this 
entire case. The real culprits should be sought by aggressive 
police work. Even if they escape there still remains the 
responsibility to determine who brought terror into our capital. 
If suspected, such persons should be rigorously investigated. 
Any diplomats found guilty should be immediately expelled and 
other suspects charged in court. Terrorism must not be 
tolerated anywhere within Thailand. Our security officials must 
take tough action and must also be seen to be taking such 
action. Bangkok is not Beirut or the occupied territories. 
Those who would use the uncivilised violence of terrorism in our 
country must be identified and dealt with unflinching firmness.

  [Text] Tadahiro Sekimoto, chairman of the Electronic 
Industries Association of Japan, commented at a news conference 
on 18 March on the U.S. electronic industry's report which 
forecast the share of foreign-made semiconductors in the 
Japanese market will reach 25-28 percent by 1996. 
  He stressed: "I am strongly concerned about the possibility 
that such a figure may get beyond our control." 
  The 1993 market share calculated by the U.S. method did not 
reach the "annual average of 20 percent" demanded by the U.S. 
Government when the Japan-U.S. semiconductor accord was 
concluded. 
  Therefore, Sekimoto's remark is meant to preempt the 
possibility that the figures in the U.S. report become the new 
"numerical target."

  [Text] Because the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) 
refusal to submit to nuclear inspections is again being referred 
to the UN Security Council [UNSC], the government is now 
considering concrete measures to take in this situation. As for 
the diplomatic aspect, the basic policy is for Japan, the United 
States, and South Korea to apply stronger pressure on North 
Korea to push it to change its mind through close coordination 
with ROK President Kim Yong-sam, who will visit Japan starting 
on 24 March. However, depending on what the United States, 
which is very much irritated by its negotiations with the DPRK, 
does from now on, the possibility remains that a [UNSC] 
resolution calling for economic sanctions -- which would be "a 
very serious matter for Japan" -- may come to pass. 
  Under the circumstances, Japan must make intensive domestic 
coordination efforts in preparation for possible economic 
sanctions, and at this point, measures such as stopping 
remittances to the DPRK, an export-import embargo, and 
restrictions on shipping services are being considered. 
However, there are also such difficult problems as how to 
ensure the effectiveness of the sanctions. 
  As for the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) 
decision to "refer the issue again to the UNSC," a Foreign 
Ministry source said that "this was an expected outcome." He 
admitted that from the point that the IAEA started to draft its 
resolution, Japan had believed that submitting the DPRK issue to 
the UNSC was inevitable. This source also predicted that "the 
UNSC will first adopt a resolution calling only for the 
unconditional acceptance of nuclear inspections to see North 
Korea's reaction." He expects that there is still some time 
before actual economic sanctions come to pass. 
  Nevertheless, the United States and the ROK are taking 
urgent 
steps to deal with the DPRK, such as agreeing to resume the Team 
Spirit joint military exercises, and to deploy Patriot 
antimissile missiles in South Korea. The government's 
assessment of the situation is that: 1) Japan, whose security 
is seriously affected, needs to coordinate its actions with the 
United States and the ROK. 2) Through the discussions with key 
leaders during Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to 
China, and the visit of Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister, to Russia, it is apparent that China and 
Russia's sense of crisis is inadequate. During President Kim 
Yong-sam's visit to Japan, the two countries will declare to the 
world that Japan and the ROK share very serious concerns and 
that they will abide by the UNSC's decisions. 
  If the UNSC does adopt a resolution on economic sanctions, 
Japan will be forced to take a tough stand. After the 1983 
Rangoon incident and the bombing of the Korean Airlines plane in 
1987, Japan has imposed certain sanctions, but these are limited 
to banning contacts between diplomats and banning the entry of 
North Korean chartered planes and DPRK civil servants. 
  Within the government, an import-export embargo, stopping 
remittances to the DPRK, and restricting shipping services are 
being considered as possible sanctions. Some officials believe 
that because there is inadequate information on remittances to 
North Korea--which are said to reach 60 billion yen to 100 
billion yen a year--"remittances cannot be stopped if they go 
through China or another third country" (according to a Foreign 
Ministry source). The problem will be how to ensure the 
effectiveness of the ban. Moreover, restricting personal travel 
is an issue that affects travelers' human rights. Japan will be 
forced to make very difficult decisions. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa has stated that Japan "will take 
responsible measures within the limits of the Constitution." 
Some believe that "support for naval activities by the U.S. 
forces in relation to the economic sanctions" may become 
inevitable. The Maritime Self-Defense Force's logistical 
support to the U.S. 7th Fleet "is still a question that needs to 
be considered in terms of a legal basis and a legal 
interpretation" (according to a senior Foreign Ministry 
official). Japan still has to coordinate the final details.

  [Text] A government source said on the morning of 22 March 
that if the UN Security Council decides to slap economic 
sanctions on North Korea in connection with its suspected 
nuclear weapons development, "it would be difficult" for the 
Japanese Government to ban the remittance of money by ethnic 
Koreans in Japan to North Korea. But he stressed that the 
"Japanese Government should make every possible effort to stop 
the ethnic Koreans from remitting money to North Korea if the UN 
Security Council imposes the economic sanctions on North Korea."

  [Text] Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic 
Organizations] will invest in Saudi Arabian small-to-medium size 
companies not belonging to the oil industry in an effort to help 
Saudi Arabia diversify its industries. As the first step to 
respond to Saudi Arabia's request, Keidanren is studying a plan 
to invest several billion yen in food, pharmaceutical, and other 
companies. Keidanren plans to coordinate the final details when 
its officials visit there in late April. 
  Through the financial cooperation of 112 major Japanese 
companies and Overseas Cooperation Fund, Keidanren established 
an investment company called "Japan International Cooperation 
Organization" [JICO] aimed at developing industries of 
developing countries in 1989. The present investment program to 
help Saudi Arabian companies will also be implemented through 
JICO. 
  Pharmaceutical and food companies, such as noodle-making 
companies, are most likely to be offered the investment. 
Originally, Saudi Arabia requested investment in auto makers. 
However, Keidanren thinks it will be difficult to meet its 
request because the amount of investment would become enormous. 
A Keidanren Secretariat official said that "if possible," 
Keidanren "wants to sign contracts" when its mission visits 
Saudi Arabia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi by </F>
Nobuaki Hanaoka, chief of SANKEI SHIMBUN political department; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] Details of an interview with Keigo Ouchi, chairman 
of the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and health and welfare 
minister are as follows. 
  [Hanaoka] Do you feel any aftereffects from the aborted 
cabinet reshuffle? 
  [Ouchi] If a decision had been made to reshuffle the 
cabinet, it would have been split into a bloc led by the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and the DSP, and a group 
composed of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito. The 
coalition's centripetal force would have been weakened too. The 
prime minister's decision to give it up was the right one. 
  [Hanaoka] What do you think of moves by Shinseito and the 
Japan New Party [JNP] to form a joint parliamentary group? 
  [Ouchi] Shinseito is probably trying to make rapid advances 
on the JNP with the argument that it is better that they 
cooperate with the JNP and create a fresh image than form a bloc 
with Komeito. I have a feeling that the prime minister is 
willing to cooperate with Sinseito. 
  [Hanaoka] What is the SDPJ going to do about that? 
  [Ouchi] There will be a freshness and the necessary 
organizational backup if the JNP, Sakigake [Harbinger], and the 
DSP form a core group. I think this is the best way as far as 
the people are concerned. However, I am not certain if we will 
move in that direction following the possible breaking of a 
pledge the JNP made to Sakigake and the differences in opinion 
within the JNP. It is not an issue for our party alone. The 
important thing is to deepen discussions. 
  [Hanaoka] Would you accept an offer to join Shinseito and 
the JNP if they ask you to? 
  [Ouchi] I never thought about it. The issue of forming a 
joint parliamentary group is linked to reorganization of the 
political world. It is not a simple matter of having everybody 
join the group. We would like to make a decision after making 
it sure what other parties' intentions are. 
  [Hanaoka] Are you going to meet Shinseito leader Tsutomu 
Hata and representative secretary Ichiro Ozawa? 
  [Ouchi] It is possible, of course. I, as a chairman of the 
DSP, have to make a decision at the final stage. 
  [Hanaoka] The phrase -- union of "liberal SDPJ and DSP" -- 
sounds good. However, I think there are considerable 
ideological differences between the two parties. 
  [Ouchi] The SDPJ has to renew itself, change its fundamental 
policies, and get rid of the leftist line if it wants to play a 
central role in reorganization of the political world. The top 
leaders of the SDPJ know that the party will be isolated unless 
they change. The party has a potential to change. 
  [Hanaoka] Do you think a joint parliamentary group or a new 
new party [shin shinto] will be formed? 
  [Ouchi] It is certain we will have an upper house election 
next year, but I think a there will be a lower house election 
before that. As upper house election candidates start 
campaigning up to one year before the elections, we will be 
forced to make a decision this summer on the formation of any 
new organization. We have to appeal to voters to find out what 
sort of political forces candidates will have as their support 
bases. We have to find the direction of our political 
reorganization before the summer. The standard tactic is to 
form a party and clarify party policies rather than trying to 
get eight coalition parties cooperate in elections through the 
nomination of joint candidates. However, it is not a matter of 
our party alone. The next best way is to cooperate with each 
other to put up joint candidates. 
  [Hanaoka] Differences in tactics will be fatal to a grand 
union [daido danketsu]. 
  [Ouchi] It will be a dictatorship if such a union allowed 
one 
particular person to freely steer the government in the way he 
or she wanted. Mr. Ozawa has explained to each coalition party 
that he will not allow that to happen. We need to talk about 
this point very carefully. 
  [Hanaoka] Some people think Mr. Ozawa's power is necessary 
to 
settle pending issues. 
  [Ouchi] I do not think so. I think we were able to create 
the centripetal force needed to maintain the Hosokawa 
administration because the SDPJ has compromised by accepting 
things that they never had previously, and also because the 
eight coalition parties exercised self-restraint. 
  [Hanaoka] What do you think of the current Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP]? 
  [Ouchi] Reorganization of the political world is an issue 
that faces all political forces, including the LDP. I think the 
LDP will split if there is a major change. The DSP is primarily 
a democratic party. It is close to the LDP, therefore, and 
there is a foundation from which we can promote dialogue between 
ourselves. On the other hand, we are far from the SDPJ. We are 
not returning to the LDP's side, even if support for the 
Hosokawa administration drops. The LDP has lost 
self-confidence. I think the LDP is trying to somehow outgrow 
its former self. 
  [Hanaoka] It seems that the LDP tactically trying to take 
the budget hostage. 
  [Ouchi] President Yohei Kono's Diet question was a de facto 
declaration of his intention to recapture power. The LDP will, 
in all probability, take a tough line and try to prevent us from 
holding budget committee meetings. This tactic will have a 
major impact on the future organization of the political world. 
The scene for the political realignment will change completely 
if the Hosokawa administration makes mistakes. The LDP is, in 
particular, pursuing the issue of the prime minister's 100 
million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin. There is no knowing what 
they will do. 
  [Hanaoka] What do you think will happen in next year's Tokyo 
gubernatorial election? Do you think Governor Suzuki will win a 
fifth term? 
  [Ouchi] We should not allow that to happen, though I cannot 
predict how the election will turn out.

  [Text] The Japan New Party [JNP] is in growing turmoil 
over the recent agreement between the JNP and Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] to form a joint parliamentary grouping. Many JNP 
members still maintain that a parliamentary grouping with 
Shinseito--which is associated with shady Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] factional politics--as a partner will only undermine 
the JNP's public image, while others are concerned that this may 
lead to the breaking off of fraternal relations dating to the 
start of the Hosokawa administration with Sakigake [Harbinger], 
with which the JNP has agreed to enter into a merger in the 
future. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa merely told Toshio 
Yamaguchi, former minister of labor, who visited him at his 
official residence on 17 March, that "I will watch future 
developments closely." This circumspection is believed to be in 
consideration of the agitation in his own home camp. 
  There has been a rush of expressions of discontent or 
concern, particularly among young JNP Diet members, over the 
emerging plan for the JNP and Shinseito to form a joint 
parliamentary group. Some say: "Even if the Diet members 
agree, what will the party members say?" Others claim: "If 
there should be a heated debate in the party, the prime 
minister's leadership will again be called into question. In 
the first place, it is anomalous that the other party leaders 
have not been informed." 
  As JNP's relationship with Sakigake falls into disarray, JNP 
Diet members say: "When we go home to our constituencies, our 
supporters cheer us up and tell us 'carry on with your 
cooperation with Sakigake'." Within the party itself, the 
prevailing opinion is that the new group should at least consist 
of Shinseito, JNP, and Sakigake. 
  A heated debate took place at the meeting of JNP Diet 
members 
on 17 March. One Dietman said, "Since we are a political party, 
decisions should be made by the proper organs. The decision to 
create a new-new party [shin shinto] with Sakigake was a policy 
adopted by the proper authorities." Another stated: "If this 
policy is to be changed, there will be a struggle between two 
lines." 
  About 10 young JNP lower house members led by Yuichi Takami 
also met in Tokyo on the evening of 17 March into the early 
hours of 18 March to discuss how to deal with the realignment of 
political parties. This shows how seriously the JNP is 
distressed by the issue of forming a bigger parliamentary group. 
  Regarding the proposed joint parliamentary group, the new 
JNP 
leadership also claims that, "It is not the prime minister's 
strategy to ally only with Shinseito. Such a claim is 
groundless." "What we have decided so far is to create a policy 
study group across party boundaries." The JNP leadership headed 
by Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka made it a point to explain 
at the joint standing committee meeting with Sakigake on 17 
March that "[The proposal] came from Shinseito; we are not 
involved in this." 
  However, Shinseito's Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa had met 
with all JNP members of both houses of the Diet as of 16 March. 
[During these meetings] Ozawa criticized Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura implicitly, saying "It is 
ridiculous that someone who does not have a clear concept of the 
state should advocate a so-called theory of the state." He 
argued that "the ruling coalition parties should join hands and 
work in unity under the leadership of Mr. Hosokawa." 
  Nevertheless, some JNP members have a favorable impression 
of 
Ozawa. They say, "Mr. Ozawa's conviction that Japan should be 
changed came across quite saliently." 
  On the other hand, there are also objections to Ozawa's 
remark at a meeting with JNP Diet members on the evening of 16 
March that "(Shinseito) will be capable of nominating candidates 
for all 300 single-seat constituencies (on its own)." JNP 
members commented that "this is like being threatened with a 
dagger pointed at your throat." 
  JNP members are beginning to feel that "perhaps the top 
leaders of the two parties are planning to form an alliance 
immediately" (according to a senior JNP official). Since the 
prime minister is the only viable symbol of the party, party 
officials admit that "the party will move in the direction the 
prime minister wishes." However, other party members also 
predict that "if there is no persuasive explanation on our 
relationship with Sakigake, some Diet members may purposely opt 
for the difficult way out."

  [Text] "Restraint should be exercised over discussions on 
political realignment until the fiscal year 1994 draft budget 
has been passed." This summarizes a number of comments 
successively made by some cabinet ministers at their informal 
gathering following a regular cabinet meeting on 22 March, in 
their apparent efforts to put a check on discussions of 
political realignment issues. Recently, stepped up discussions 
have been noted among ruling coalition parties over such issues, 
including a plan by the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the 
Japan New Party [JNP] to form a parliamentary group. 
  Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato (of the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ]) was the first to begin making the 
comments. He first expressed concern about the fact that the 
Diet has remained idle for nearly two weeks, as it remains 
uncertain as to when the lower house Budget Committee would 
begin deliberations on the draft budget. He then asserted: "The 
government and the ruling coalition parties have been carried 
away with discussing political realignment issues day after day, 
neglecting the budget. This is one of the reasons the cabinet 
support rating has dropped." "In light of the current situation 
regarding deliberations on the draft budget, we should all look 
forward to the passage of the draft budget and the `higire' 
bills [bills with a time limit] and refrain from commenting on 
the political realignment issues," he added. 
  Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi (of the SDPJ) joined 
Sato 
and said: "This is a very important matter. Considering the 
trends in the public opinion poll, we should all strive to 
strengthen the (cabinet's) centripetal force." 
  Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi (of the Komeito) followed 
suit and said: "It is important to have the people understand 
that the cabinet is united."

<F P=106> [Article by Kenichi Ohmae, director of McKinsey &amp; Company </F>
Inc.: "The Inventory of a Zero Fighter-Like Nation -- Japan"] 
  [Text] "No amount of negotiations will reach a favorable 
conclusion when we are forced to deal with Japanese bureaucrats. 
They will never abandon their vested rights unless they are hit 
by an atomic bomb," an American trade negotiator said angrily 
when I met with him recently. 
  I do not totally agree with him. However, the truth is that 
what Japanese bureaucrats are doing now is similar to what their 
predecessors, including the military authorities, were doing 
toward the end of World War II when Japan's defeat was already 
evident. 
  What did the military authorities do at that time? Until the 
curtain came down, they did not admit that Japan had lost its 
power. As a result, Japan continuously fought a bitter retreat, 
and let itself in for the Imphal action. The Japanese 
authorities were finally made aware of their defeat only after 
the nation was hit by two atomic bombs. Moreover, they had the 
audacity to use the expression "the end of the war" instead 
"defeat in war." 
  Meanwhile, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United 
States conducted what is referred to as operations research: It 
conducted scientific research on warfare, using statistics and 
the law of probability. The United States placed greater 
emphasis on aircraft carriers, while the large guns of the 
battleship remained the key weapon of the Japanese. In other 
words, the United States learned many things while waging war. 
  Once again, Japanese bureaucrats have fallen into the same 
logic as used during World War II. The current war between 
Japan and the United States differs from the previous one only 
in means. The two countries now use economic might instead of 
armed force. Meanwhile, Japanese bureaucrats continue to take 
exactly the same attitude their predecessors did 50 years ago. 
Although the outcome of the war is already evident, they do not 
want to admit it. The public also shows a similar attitude as 
it did 50 years ago; people continue to watch the development of 
events in silence. Major newspapers play up the information 
released by the government, as they used to do with the official 
announcements made by the Imperial Headquarters 50 years ago. 
  In December 1993, NEWSWEEK did a cover story on the end of 
the Japanese system. It explained the collapse of Japan by 
using the present perfect tense. It clearly said: "The system 
has crashed." In November 1993, before the NEWSWEEK cover story 
appeared, I also mentioned in my book The Ohmae 
Report--Toward a Fundamental Restructuring of Japan 
(published by Kodansha Ltd.) that the Japanese economic system 
had crashed. 
  What are the factors that brought about the end of the 
Japanese centralist system? One of the main factors is the 
strong departmentalism of Japanese administrative agencies. 
  The defect of departmentalism is the nonexistence of a 
responsible person capable of studying a question in its broader 
aspects. For instance, the Ministry of Finance is composed of 
several divisions such as the Budget Bureau, the Tax Bureau, the 
Banking Bureau, the Securities Bureau, and the Financial Bureau. 
Top-ranking officials feel the entire situation automatically 
comes out correctly if every bureau works well. That is the 
same mentality the General Staff had during the Greater East 
Asia War. At that time, the General Staff could not help 
adopting an optimistic view regarding the outcome of the war, 
since every general reported the war was going in his favor on 
his battle front. 
  The industrial world has the same problem: the nonexistence 
of a business leader capable of looking at the main points. 
  For instance, let us study the auto industry. After years of 
complicated negotiations, Japan and the United States agreed to 
raise Japan's self-imposed export quota from 1.68 million to 2.3 
million vehicles. In order to sell more cars, Japanese 
automakers had to establish their manufacturing plants in the 
United States, and now their U.S. subsidiaries are obliged to 
procure 50 percent or more of a vehicle's parts in the United 
States because, under U.S. local-content legislation, a locally 
made car cannot be considered American if 50 percent of its 
value does not come from parts and labor originating in the 
United States. 
  A total of 125 manufacturers, including auto parts 
manufacturers, have moved to the United States to produce 2 
million vehicles. 
  Japanese manufacturers want to export 2.3 million cars from 
Japan and manufacture 2 million more vehicles in the United 
States. If that is the case, the U.S. market would be flooded 
with 4.3 million Japanese cars. Since the U.S. market is 
estimated at 10 million cars, it would mean more than 40 percent 
of the market would be dominated by Japanese cars. "Politically 
speaking, is such a situation acceptable?" Unfortunately, no 
one considers the matter. When I asked this question to the top 
executive of each auto manufacturer, each replied in the same 
way. "I do not know what the other companies are doing, but 
there is no problem with us because we are planning to sell only 
1 million cars." Their attitude proves that in the auto 
industry, no one can see the problem in perspective. 
  Japan Is Just Like a Zero Fighter ("Flying Fuel Tank") 
  In the first chapter of my book Borderless World 
(published in English by Harper &amp; Row, and published in 
Japanese 
by President Inc.), I had already raised the question in 
anticipation of the current situation. I said the glut of 
Japanese cars in the U.S. market would become serious in the 
near future. The United States feels Japan has two choices: 
export 2.3 million cars from Japan, or produce 2 million cars in 
the United States. It is not a question of exporting 2.3 
million cars from Japan and producing 2 million more in the 
United States simultaneously. Therefore, in my book I explained 
that once Japanese plants begin to produce 2 million cars in the 
United States, the U.S. Government might ban exports of those 
2.3 million cars from Japan. I added that what is certain at 
the very least is the U.S. Government will never accept over 4 
million Japanese cars in the U.S. market. 
  U.S. automakers can now buy Japanese-made high-quality auto 
parts at a low price; consequently, Japanese manufacturers have 
lost their competitive superiority. Cars manufactured by U.S. 
automakers in Detroit are cheaper than those made by Japanese 
manufacturers. Detroit is now completely restored to its former 
state, and is able to produce a car 30 percent cheaper than a 
Japanese car of similar quality. Under the pressure of 
necessity, Japanese automakers have abandoned the mass market to 
place greater emphasis on luxury cars. The U.S. automobile 
industry, which had been suffering severely in the recession as 
if it had continuously been exposed to heavy rain, now enjoys 
fine weather. Recently, Chrysler Corporation and Ford Motor 
Company recorded their highest sales and profits. 
  The change in the situation reminds me of the Pacific war. 
It may safely be said the Japan of today is the exact image of 
a Zero fighter. 
  At the sacrifice of safety, the Zero fighter was designed to 
be faster and more maneuverable and to carry more bombs. Thus, 
when it was attacked by the enemy, its fuselage could be easily 
pierced by bullets, proving fatal to the crew members. Japanese 
cars of today are the exact incarnation of Zero fighters. 
  The Zero fighter was nicknamed the "Flying Fuel Tank" 
because 
of its thin armor plating. Not only the auto industry but all 
of Japanese society can be symbolized as such. 
  Japan made many sacrifices to reach its ultimate goal of 
building a national economy based on exports. Such being the 
case, Japanese companies were able to defeat their competitors. 
However, their victory was superficial and ephemeral, for it 
was not long before they saw their infrastructure being 
destroyed because of its fragility. Now they are confronted 
with a disastrous situation. This is exactly what happened to 
the Zero fighter during World War II. 
  Five years ago people frequently spoke about the collapse of 
the U.S. manufacturing industry. At that time, U.S. 
manufacturers were actually in the midst of restructuring. Five 
years ago, the weakness of the U.S. manufacturing industry was 
conspicuous, with many companies declaring bankruptcy or having 
to lay off workers and close down. Thanks to fundamental 
restructuring, once-strong companies have made a comeback, 
becoming more powerful than ever. They have reduced their 
working staffs by half thanks to reengineering (a total 
rethinking of business processes and practices) and to a 
substantial rationalization of indirect labor, which was 
supported by the introduction of information technology systems. 
The United States owes what it is today to these drastic 
measures aimed at changing the management system. 
  Far from holding a 40-percent share in the auto U.S. market, 
Japanese automakers are not even able to maintain a 25-percent 
market share under the present state of affairs. They cannot 
sell more than 2.3 million vehicles in total, inclusive of those 
imported from Japan and manufactured locally. This sales volume 
is equivalent to the self-imposed export quota (Japanese auto 
exports to the United States have currently decreased to 1.65 
million vehicles). Therefore, they want to shut down their U.S. 
plants, which have a total capacity of 2 million vehicles. 
However, they cannot take such a measure since their U.S. 
plants went into operation only recently. Moreover, politically 
speaking, the closing down of plants would considerably affect 
the Japan-U.S. relationship. Japan-bashers would certainly 
criticize Japan, saying: "Once again Japanese companies created 
employment destabilization in the United States by shutting down 
their plants." 
  The only solution left to them is to reduce their exports 
from Japan. Unfortunately, no corporate executives are ready to 
give up exports and tackle the employment issue at home. They 
have a glib tongue; all they can do is stress the need for 
originality and ingenuity, while their companies continue to 
lose strength. Japanese companies are now heading toward a dead 
end. Moment by moment, things are becoming serious, approaching 
the day when Japan will be hit by another atomic bomb. 
  What has the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
been doing until now? All it has done is back up Japan's 
overseas production. In other words, MITI did nothing other 
than participate along with the United States in hastening the 
death of Japanese companies by encouraging them to establish 
their plants in the United States. 
  Another problem is that Japanese products are driven out of 
the market because of foreign-made "Japanese products." 
  The parts manufacturing industry is equipment-intensive. 
Therefore, without mass production, a parts manufacturer cannot 
pay its way. Domestically, Japanese parts manufacturers have 
been suffering from sluggish sales due to a prolonged recession. 
They must export their products to Southeast Asia at low prices. 
In the case of office automation and audiovisual products, both 
of which are the forte of Japanese companies, the result was it 
became possible to reduce costs by 30 percent by assembling 
these products in Southeast Asia. Singapore, for instance, is 
flooded with all kinds of Japanese-made parts. Some of them are 
exported to the United States from there. 
  Domestically, Japanese manufacturers do not feel the need to 
reduce prices. They continue to impose their expensive office 
automation products, as well as their expensive audiovisual 
products, on Japanese users. Under the circumstances, it is 
quite normal that "Japanese-made Japanese products" cannot 
compete with "Asian-made Japanese products" in the U.S. market. 
Moreover, some of these "Asian-made Japanese products" are 
reimported to Japan. There is no help for Japanese 
manufacturers. What one has sown, one will have to reap. 
Japanese companies have rapidly lost their competitive power in 
this manner. 
  The transfer to Southeast Asia was not limited to the parts 
manufacturing industry. Other manufacturers completely switched 
to overseas production by establishing their production hub in 
Southeast Asia or China, causing the so-called 
deindustrialization of Japan. As a temporary measure to cope 
with the situation, hard-hit companies are content to ask the 
government for "employment adjustment subsidies" to retrain and 
relocate their excess workers. In Japan, large companies cannot 
easily dismiss their employees because, if they create 
unemployment, they will be summoned by the Ministry of Labor and 
be chastised for engaging in such an inadmissible act. This is 
why an excellent company like Hitachi Ltd. applies for subsidies 
when it finds itself with a large number of excess workers. In 
1993, the total amount of such subsidies exceeded 100 billion 
yen. 
  Steel products, automobiles, audiovisual products, and 
semiconductors--all these industries were doing fine until five 
years ago. Now most of them are unable to make profits in the 
export market. With the current dollar-yen exchange rate at the 
level of 110 yen to the dollar, no Japanese companies are able 
to bring their export business out of the red. They will 
probably not reach the break-even point as long as the dollar 
remains below the 130 yen level. 
  The long and short of it is that Japanese companies are 
merely pushing themselves into a tight corner. The logic is 
simple, but unfortunately business leaders are unaware of it. 
Or they might be conscious of it, but think they have gone too 
far to retreat. None of them wants to announce a curtailment of 
output because none of them is sure if other companies will 
follow their example, so everyone says: "Our company will 
continue to produce this much for the present term." In any 
case, Japan is now at death's door, just as it was towards the 
end of World War II. 
<H5>  The Economic Stimulus Package Will Have No Impact </H5>
  "What in the world is the government doing? What it must do 
is urgently adopt a new economic stimulus package." Japanese 
business executives repeat this sentence unceasingly. The 
adoption of pump-priming measures will be charged to the 
national treasury. That is to say, the government will have to 
spend tax money collected from the public. This means that, by 
demanding implementation of a new economic stimulus package, 
Japanese business leaders are trying to saddle taxpayers with 
their debts which are the result of their over-optimistic way of 
doing business. As corporate managers, they should have many 
other things to do before complaining to the government. 
However, the fact is they are unable to wrestle with adverse 
circumstances because everything went so smoothly for them for 
many years. During the period when Reaganomics and Thatcherism 
were in full swing, no U.S. or British corporate executives 
asked their government for help. Rather, they did their best to 
carry out restructuring for the survival of their companies. In 
the United States and Great Britain, a timid executive would be 
immediately ousted from the board meeting. 
  As for Japanese labor unions, they have neither the 
competency nor moral energy to go on strike. Most have not gone 
on strike during the past 35 years. They just continue to 
accumulate union dues. It is not unusual for a Japanese labor 
union to organize a one-day trip for all its members for a 
karaoke party at a bath resort. However, no one goes on strike 
to call management's responsibility into question. Rengo 
[National Confederation of Trade Unions] is pleased it has come 
into power [a parliamentary group composed of Rengo-affiliated 
councilors is currently a coalition member]. However, the 
coalition government did nothing but raise public utility 
charges such as postal rates, the transaction tax on gas, oil, 
subway fares, and tuition fees for public universities. Is this 
in line with the doctrine advocated by Rengo that sovereignty 
resides in the consumers? 
  Moreover, the ordinary postage of domestic mail is now 80 
yen; it is cheaper to send a letter by air to Japan from the 
United States or Australia. What is going on in Japan? With a 
labor union in power, I expected a less objectionable situation. 
  As for management, it continues to marshal all sorts of 
flowery words without taking any action. "No one will be 
dismissed so long as I hold power." Corporate executives hold 
such feelings because they have always set great value on 
labor-capital harmonization. While Japanese corporate executives 
remain idle, Japan's international competitiveness continues to 
fade away. 
  To begin with, it is overly optimistic to think the 
implementation of a new pump-priming package will somehow help 
improve the economic situation. An economic stimulus package, 
no matter how large, cannot pull the national economy out of 
recession. 
<H5>  The Wage Level Will Stabilize in the United States and China </H5>
  Let us suppose the national economy recovered, or the dollar 
again reached the 130 yen level. Even under such circumstances, 
Japan will be unable to beat the United States, the reason being 
the U.S. manufacturing industry has regained its competitive 
power in the true sense of the term. Its recuperative power is 
sustained by labor costs. 
  The average salary of an American worker has not increased 
for 13 years, since the Reagan era. In fact, in the case of 
white-collar workers, who account for 25 percent of the working 
class, their wages have increased by 28 percent. As for the 25 
percent at the bottom of the working class, their wages have 
decreased by 10 percent. On average, the wage level has 
remained almost unchanged for many years in the United States. 
  For instance, in Japan the average salary of a 
Rengo-affiliated worker is about 7.2 million yen; meanwhile, in 
the United States the average salary of a comparable worker is 
about 4 million yen. This is a little less than 60 percent of 
the Japanese worker's salary. The recovery of the U.S. industry 
is supported by such competitive labor costs. 
  Moreover, in addition to labor costs, the impact of the 
North 
American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] should be also taken into 
consideration. 
  NAFTA aims at transforming North America into one huge, 
single market by 1999. In Canada, where the population totals 
25 million, the salary of a white-collar worker is about 30 
percent lower than that of a U.S. worker. Meanwhile, in Mexico, 
where the population totals 80 million, the salary of a 
blue-collar worker is one-eighth that of a U.S. worker's. What 
does this mean for U.S. industry? It means U.S. companies might 
move to Canada or Mexico for low-wage labor if U.S. workers 
request higher wages. 
  In other words, U.S. business executives have obtained a new 
option which is extremely favorable for them. NAFTA has this 
important significance. In the United States, wage levels will 
probably not increase over the next 10 years as they did during 
the past 10. 
  Let us now turn our eyes to Japan. We see China is just 
behind Japan. China has completely changed since March 1992. 
Many say China is a nation with two systems. In my own 
opinion, China completely follows the capitalist line, or the 
mammonist line. 
  In China, the average salary of a blue-collar worker is no 
more than 60,000 yen a year. Even for a work leader or a 
foreman or a white-collar worker, the annual salary is about 
90,000 yen. A Chinese worker at the Baoshan Iron &amp; Steel 
Complex or Maanshan Iron and Steel Corporation makes no more 
than 90,000 yen, while a Japanese worker employed by Nippon 
Steel Corporation earns more than 10 million yen annually. 
Although both workers make the same product--crude steel--the 
labor cost is 100 times higher in Japan. 
  To me, the advent of a reborn China is the same as if 28 new 
nations like Singapore were formed simultaneously. For 
instance, when we look at Dalian or Tianjin, we realize there 
are already many factories assembling such products as the main 
memory unit for laptop computers, or factories manufacturing 
cylinder heads for video recorders. In the past, even North 
America could barely produce cylinder heads. In other words, 
apart from a few high-tech products such as liquid crystal 
displays, and apart from some capital- intensive industries, 
almost everything can be manufactured in China, where it 
requires only 1 percent of the Japanese labor cost. Moreover, 
with a population of 1.2 billion, China has an unlimited supply 
of labor. 
  The most important point is that, like in the United States, 
wage levels will remain unchanged in China. 
  In South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore the labor market is 
quite homogeneous. When the economy takes a favorable turn, the 
labor market tightens rapidly, bringing about an increase in 
wages. However, in China the labor market is very diversified. 
For instance, if the wage is $12,000 in Hong Kong, it might be 
$6,000 in the adjacent area of Shenzhen; in Guangzhou it might 
be one-third of that in Shenzhen, while in Yunnan it might be 
one-third of the amount in Guangzhou. More and more people work 
for lower wages the farther you go inland. China has an 
"unlimited storage reservoir of labor." 
  In other words, the colonialization of the inland areas by 
the coastal areas is expected to continue, so the wages of 
Chinese workers in labor-intensive industries will not increase 
over the next 10 years. 
  Unfortunately, Japanese corporate managers are not 
threatened 
by the fact that wage levels will remain unchanged both in the 
United States and China. Moreover, there is no risk of their 
losing their position, unlike in the United States where there 
was a time when corporate executives were toppled one after 
another. 
  At the beginning of the year, when I attended New Year's 
parties organized by major economic organizations in Tokyo and 
Osaka, I got the impression that Japanese corporate executives 
were still enjoying a period of peace and tranquillity; their 
only concern was who will be the next chairman of Keidanren 
[Japan Federation of Economic Organizations]? They quarreled 
over this question. At a different gathering held to wish one 
another a happy New Year, corporate executives all joined in 
chanting against the government: "That's enough with political 
reform! Hurry with the economic stimulus package!" 
  In this article I am trying to present several problems that 
affect the basic competitive strength of Japanese industry. 
These are not the kind of problems that can be settled easily 
by initiating a new pump-priming program. 
  Let us suppose the national economy recovers due to the 
effects of an economic stimulus package. If such were the case, 
U.S. and Chinese products would immediately invade the Japanese 
market. Japanese manufacturers, who have been deceiving Japanese 
consumers by imposing expensive products on them, would suffer 
from a sharp decrease in prices. Therefore, even if the economy 
picks up, there is no possibility of them doubling their 
business. The government is at its wit's end. It has already 
implemented every imaginable macroeconomic measure: emergency 
public investment worth 30 trillion yen, an all-time low 
interest rate, and a continuous increase in the money supply. 
Unfortunately, these measures have not induced people to spend 
more money. Companies have received no new orders. 
  To stimulate the economy, Japanese business leaders are 
calling for income tax reductions and fiscal investment. They 
are merely trying to resort to an old method that worked 10 
years ago. This method was correct when Japan's major 
industries were improving their competitive power. Moreover, at 
that time the United States had no intention of seriously 
quarreling with Japan due to the Cold War. This was why the 
United States did not launch an offensive to induce a sharp 
appreciation of the yen against the dollar as it is doing now. 
However, in the United States today there is a theory that when 
the dollar is quoted at 100 yen, it will have the same effect as 
dropping another atomic bomb on Japan. Quite a few people 
seriously think continued appreciation of the yen against the 
dollar would serve the best interests of Japan in the long run. 
  With respect to the yen-dollar exchange rate, I have already 
written several times in this magazine that both the United 
States and Japan are adopting a wrong view of the matter. 
Trying to correct the trade imbalance by manipulating the 
exchange rate is a gross error. It is clear the real intention 
of the United States is to debilitate Japanese companies, and 
particularly to weaken the competitive strength of Japan's 
export-intensive industries. 
  Japanese bureaucrats are tolerating the high appreciation of 
the yen against the dollar, saying it will help rectify the 
trade imbalance, because they cannot grasp the main point. What 
they have been doing in concert with the business world is 
nothing less than wrecking Japan's export industry, the only 
means for Japan to accumulate wealth. In the United States, a 
certain Dr. Jack Kevorkian recently invented a suicide machine. 
It is as if the Japanese Government had prepared a similar 
device on its own initiative, and is now experimenting on 
Japanese industry with it. 
  No Japanese industry can survive in a world where the dollar 
is quoted at 100 yen. However, even if the dollar returns to 
the 130 yen level, the problem will not be settled. Rather, the 
competitive power of the United States would become more 
conspicuous. It is no exaggeration to say the United States has 
regained its competitiveness to that extent. 
<H5>  The United States Is the Sole Winner of the Intelligence War </H5>
  The other problem is that the large guns of the 
battleship--namely automobiles and household electric 
appliances--no longer serve as key weapons in the current war. 
In the long run, the production of such products will be 
completely transferred to low wage-labor areas such as Asia and 
Mexico. 
  The 21st century will see the outbreak of an intelligence 
war. In this war, white-collar workers in tertiary industries 
will be the main soldiers. From now on, the wealth of a nation 
will be built by these people. Lucrative fields or products 
with brilliant prospects are multimedia, the information 
superhighway advocated by Vice President Al Gore, Microsoft's 
operating system, IBM's operating system, Novell's network 
integration system, Oracle's network integration system, power 
PC', and microprocessors developed by Intel Corporation. 
  Unfortunately, in Japan no company is capable of competing 
with the United States in these fields, nor are there any 
competitors in Europe. The United States stands unchallenged in 
these fields. Moreover, although it is an industry worth tens of 
trillions of yen, it does not appear on trade statistics because 
of its specificity: it makes its profit by transmitting 
information data, even though the protection of intellectual 
property was included in the Uruguay Round agreements recently 
signed by the GATT nations, including Japan. The area in which 
the United States is planning to make money in the 21st century 
was definitely secured by GATT. Meanwhile, Japan made a huge 
mistake by considering the agricultural issue as the most 
important area of the multilateral trade negotiations. Japan 
cannot rid itself of the mental attitudes of the 19th century. 
What Japan did regarding the Uruguay Round is beyond criticism. 
  Why is it impossible for Japan to beat the United States 
in this area? It is because the Ministry of Education still 
maintains the same education system it had a few decades ago. 
Japanese children are still educated and trained to become the 
type of "corporate warrior" that has existed for many years. 
  The Japanese education system is aimed at training people so 
they can mass-produce products under strict quality control. 
This is why Japanese children are forced to memorize what their 
teachers say and act accordingly to what they have stored in 
their memories. This educational method was once successful. 
However, people educated in this manner are not suited to be 
warriors in the intelligence war. 
  The United States has produced many successful businessmen 
such as Bill Gates of Microsoft Corporation, Mitch Kapor and Jim 
Manzi of Lotus Development Corporation, and Steven P. Jobs of 
Next Computer Corporation (the founder of Apple Computer Inc.). 
If these people were born in Japan, they would have constantly 
flunked the Japanese education system. Even a man like Ross 
Perot falls into this category. Such network integrators as 
Electronic Data System Corporation (EDS) and Perot System 
Corporation were founded by him. We will soon live in an age 
when only people like these will be able to amass vast fortunes. 
Unfortunately, such people do not exist in Japan or Europe. 
  There are many other areas in which the United States can 
make money in the 21st century. For instance, there is the 
credit card. American Express, Visa, and Mastercard are all 
American. The fields of hospital management, rental-car 
services, cable TV networks, and hotel-chain management are 
mostly dominated by Americans. For instance, such U.S. 
companies as Tele-Communications Inc. and Viacom Inc. have the 
edge in the field of cable TV. With plenty of money on hand, 
Japan and Germany have bought several U.S. companies in these 
fields. Nevertheless, the United States continues to take full 
control of its knowledge. Concerning the application of 
artificial intelligence on Wall Street, many expert analysts, 
the so-called "rocket scientists," have participated in the 
development project. The long and short of it is that the 
United States stands unchallenged in these fields of the 21st 
century, fields that require creativity and originality. 
<H5>  In One Sense, Japan Is Quite a Museum Piece </H5>
  Both the U.S. and Japanese Governments resort to trade 
statistics when they hold negotiations on reducing Japan's trade 
surplus. The problem is that statistical figures only indicate 
the past. As a management consultant, I am thinking about the 
future competitive power of Japan and the United States. In my 
view, the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States no 
longer exists. It is now Japan's turn to supplicate the U.S. 
Government for help, saying, "Please do us a favor, because U.S. 
companies are now too powerful." 
  Based on the realities of five years ago, both governments 
are still negotiating on how to reduce the $100 billion trade 
surplus. The day trade negotiations are concluded, Japan will 
probably have to immediately open another round of negotiations 
to ask the United States for assistance. Japan will beg on its 
knees, saying, "We are now powerless against U.S. companies, so 
please give us odds." Twenty years ago, Japan negotiated with 
the United States over the textile trade; no more than a year 
after the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. textile agreement, the 
U.S. textile industry lost its ability to export to Japan, being 
threatened by Taiwanese as well as Korean imports. After all, 
that is how governmental negotiations are, and we cannot expect 
more from them. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton 
should bear these facts in mind when they meet in Washington on 
11 February. However, when I checked the contents of the 
economic framework talks now under way at the working level, I 
realized both governments are totally ignorant of the new 
tendency of the times. 
  I would like to make a proposition to the Japanese 
Government. "Please face up to the reality that the United 
States already stands unchallenged. It is not too late, so take 
stock of the situation immediately." 
  If we make a thorough investigation, we will immediately 
notice that one-half of the $100 billion trade surplus was 
yielded by no more than 20 companies, and more precisely by only 
two industries--the auto and electronics industries (machine 
tools were once a major export item, but not anymore). Thus, 
when these 20 companies are ruined, it will be the end of Japan. 
As a matter of fact, all these companies are done for now. 
  Moreover, what is worse is only 13 percent of the Japanese 
working population, which totals 67 million people, is employed 
by these two industries and their allied industries. The 
remaining 87 percent are employed by other secondary industries 
such as woodworking, food processing, nonferrous metal 
manufacturing, and construction; by primary industries such as 
farming and fishing; and by tertiary industries such as 
merchandising, including wholesale and retail businesses. 
  Let us now look into these low-productivity industries that 
employ 87 percent of the working population. We can see their 
competitive power is almost nothing, or at best it is less than 
half of that of the united States. For instance, in the case of 
the food processing industry, its competitive strength is 
one-third of the U.S. industry's. As regards the retail 
business, it is no more than one-quarter. 
  I am really impressed that Japan has survived until now 
despite 87 percent of its working population being 
"inefficient." Japan has survived because the "efficient" 
population who represent no more than 13 percent of the working 
total have shouldered a heavier tax burden and have tolerated 
increased costs of living in the form of invisible taxes in 
order to recover the loss caused by these "inefficient" people. 
The low-productivity industries, which employ 87 percent of the 
working population, used to exert strong pressure on the 
government. They merely had to present petitions to receive 
huge subsidies. Therefore, they had no need to improve their 
productivity. For 20 years, starting with the Kakuei Tanaka 
cabinet, the government has adopted a policy based on the 
principle of distributing wealth rather than creating wealth. 
  "Inefficient" people employed by low-productivity industries 
were suddenly fear-stricken with losing their employment. 
Following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round they realized 
they were suddenly exposed to international competition. 
Imagine nine people hanging off a single-seat airplane. 
Despite this, the flight proceeded smoothly until now. 
However, one day the pilot was suddenly struck with fear and 
lost control of his plane. The result was no one escaped from 
the crash. This is exactly what happened to those working in 
the low-productivity industries. 
  There is no doubt the central bureaucracy is the main cause 
of this catastrophic situation. By taking advantage of their 
departmentalism, every administrative agency has been 
maintaining close contacts with a specific industry. 
"Inefficient" people have been protected thanks to the 
so-called "iron triangle"--the cozy relationship between 
politicians, bureaucrats, and business leaders which is seen as 
the breeder of graft. In the past, silk-raising farmers, 
food-processing companies specializing in konnyaku [paste made 
from starch of the devil's tongue], and many other businesses 
have been protected. For each category of business, it is 
possible to cite the name of a politician acting as its 
protector. 
  The government has long cherished these old-fashioned 
industries of the 19th century, so they remain unchanged. In 
this sense, Japan is a museum piece. There is no other modern 
nation like it. Even in France, industries other than 
agriculture have been eliminated. This is because European 
industries went through such an ordeal on the occasion of the 
creation of a single European market. 
  To tell the truth, the high appreciation of the yen against 
the dollar and the conclusion of the Uruguay Round are 
respectively like the two atomic bombs that destroyed Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki. However, many have still not awakened to the 
situation. They have the same mentality as those who urged a 
decisive battle on the Japanese homeland at the end of World War 
II. 
  Once again, Japan has been hit by two atomic bombs. Sooner 
or 
later Japan will face a serious employment crisis. The 
unemployment rate recently reached 2.7 percent, and people are 
making a fuss about it. However, the actual condition is much 
more serious. I spoke about the advent of massive unemployment 
a few years ago while appearing on "Point of View/Point at 
Issue," a TV program televised by NHK. During the program, I 
used a chart to explain that an unemployment ratio of nearly 14 
percent, which had already become a reality in Europe, is within 
the bounds of possibility in Japan. I added that unemployment 
would increase as follows: an increase of 1 percent caused by 
the lifting of the rice ban; another increase of 3 percent 
caused by the promotion of market liberalization; another 
increase of 6 percent caused by liberalization of the 
distribution system; and another increase of 1 percent caused by 
the restructuring of medium enterprises and large businesses. 
  Meanwhile, the government continues to provide "employment 
adjustment subsidies" to hard-hit companies so they can continue 
to employ excess workers. In other words, the government 
continues to spend precious money collected from taxpayers in 
order to preserve uncompetitive companies. Such subsidies are 
like narcotics. The government has already spent 100 billion 
yen in a short period of time. If it does not change its 
policy, the final expense will total trillions of yen. 
<H5>  "The Aoyama Trading Phenomenon" </H5>
  Consumers have been cheated under a system based on the 
so-called "iron triangle." The only lucky circumstance is the 
"Aoyama Trading phenomenon" which presented itself over the past 
few years. The "Aoyama Trading phenomenon" is a revolt by 
companies in the service industry in collusion with consumers. 
  Aoyama Trading Company and Aoki International Company are 
two 
famous chain-store operators specializing in men's clothing. 
They are typical discount retailers. In the United States, 
such companies are called category-killers. What kind of 
strategy does a category-killer have? It specializes in a very 
specific item. This item belongs to a category of consumer's 
durable goods which are purchased infrequently. For instance, 
with a price ranging from 30,000 to 50,000 yen or more, 
ready-made men's suits are a category-killer item. Once the 
item is fixed, the category-killer tries to force out retailers 
that deal in similar items. Some of the major Japanese 
category-killers are: Victoria, well-known for selling ski 
equipment at low prices; Yodobashi Camera, well-known for 
selling camera equipment at low prices; and Kawachiya, known for 
selling cosmetics and liquor at low prices. MK Taxi, which 
became the first taxi company to reduce fares following the 
government announcement allowing operators to freely set taxi 
fares, also falls into this category. In the United States, 
this strategy has become the central idea of the distribution 
revolution. 
  A category-killer like Aoyama Trading needs no more than 
three years to achieve victory over other companies which are 
still trying to somehow impose expensive products on consumers 
by resorting to the "iron triangle." Japanese category-killers 
are gradually boring holes through the existing system. In the 
near future, the entire distribution industry will follow the 
example of Aoyama Trading. In the long run, even the housing 
industry will be affected by the "Aoyama Trading phenomenon." 
For instance, some companies might begin importing tract homes 
from Australia to sell at the reasonable price of 100,000 yen 
per tsubo [3.954 sq yds]. 
  After World War II, there was a period when many great 
challengers appeared one after another: Konosuke Matsushita 
(founder of Matsushita Group); Soichiro Honda (founder of Honda 
Motor Company); Toshio Iue (founder of Sanyo Electric Company); 
Masaru Ibuka (chief founder of Sony Corporation); and Genichi 
Kawakami (founder of Yamaha Corporation). Category-killers are 
similar to them. They made their own opportunities for new 
businesses because the establishment had become too conservative 
to devote itself to the defense of its stronghold. 
  Seen from the consumer viewpoint, the spread of the "Aoyama 
Trading phenomenon" should be welcomed. However, in terms of 
employment it is contestable. In the United States, most of the 
mom-and-pop toy stores folded following the invasion by Toys `R' 
Us, a famous toy store chain. This is why many Americans 
criticized the company as follows: "It is not right to treat 
Chairman Charles Lazarus of Toys `R' Us like a hero because he 
created employment destabilization." There is some truth in 
that. 
  However, when we consider the problem, we come to the 
conclusion that category-killers would not have appeared on the 
scene if those who had been engaged in tedious business had 
restructured or rationalized. In any case, even if the 
industrial world does not change its stance to create a more 
consumer-oriented economy, or even if it continues to put 
pressure on the government for the implementation of economic 
stimulus measures as well as measures to protect domestic 
industries, the restructuring of old-fashioned sectors cannot be 
avoided. Moreover, companies unable to restructure themselves 
will not survive in the future. Restructuring is the only way 
left for Japan. 
<H5>  The Deregulation of Controls on 94 Items Is a Childish Trick </H5>
  The only problem is whether the current government has the 
courage to carry out a fundamental restructuring of Japan. 
Prime Minister Hosokawa recently announced the deregulation of 
controls on 94 items. However, when we look at the deregulation 
carried out by Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan, Hosokawa's 
plan seems quite out of the question. In a country like Japan 
where 10,900 items are already subject to government control, 
and where 500 new items are added to the control list every 
year, there is little point in easing controls on 94 items. 
Moreover, when we look at the deregulation list presented by 
the government, we realize all these deregulatory measures are 
harmless and inoffensive. Hosokawa's plan is quite puerile; 
this is not deregulation at all. 
  True deregulation has a strong negative effect. Both U.S. 
and British economies which suffered from deregulation in the 
1980's are now recovering; it is the turn of other countries to 
feel the pain. Countries such as Japan, South Korea, Germany, 
and Switzerland, which were blessed by high economic growth in 
the 1980's and which have steered clear of deregulation, will 
suffer from here on. 
  Deregulation means a change in the existing rules of 
competition. As a result, the actual winner will become the 
loser, while the actual loser and newcomer will become the 
winner. 
  It is certain the "Aoyama Trading phenomenon" will spread 
across the nation, though the government is pretending not to 
notice. It is no longer possible to stop the movement because 
Japanese consumers have been cheated and overcharged for too 
long. According to OECD and the World Bank, the purchasing 
power parity of the dollar to the yen is 1:190. When we take 
this figure into consideration, we can see how high commodity 
prices are in Japan. 
  Purchasing power parity represents the mean value of the 
cost 
of living. It means Japanese consumers are cheated of 80 yen by 
the government since the dollar is now quoted at around 110 yen. 
  So what we need is a politician who can make desperate 
efforts to reduce the disparity as much as possible. We need a 
government capable of increasing the dollar from the 110 yen to 
the 140 yen level, while simultaneously making purchasing power 
parity fall from the 190 yen to the 140 yen level. Once these 
two goals are achieved, the Japanese market society will become 
open and lucid. It will also be possible for Japan to play fair 
without facing hesitation from the international community 
within the framework of the Uruguay Round. 
  As I said previously, the spread of the "Aoyama Trading 
phenomenon" will create unemployment. Meanwhile, the reduction 
of differences between the exchange rate and purchasing power 
parity will probably cause employment destabilization as well. 
It might even lead to a dreadful consequence: an unemployment 
rate of 10 percent. 
  However, if things work out that way, it will be possible to 
build homes at a reasonable price, and land prices will also 
decrease. This will create new demands for various products. 
  For instance, if you buy a new home located 45 minutes 
from your office by train, and if the home is two or three times 
as spacious as the apartment you currently have, and if the 
price is only five times as much as your annual income, you will 
inevitably need more utensils because you will have a bigger 
kitchen. You will also spend more money on furniture, and will 
probably need two cars. 
  As a matter of course, some industrial sectors will be 
eliminated during this process. If unemployment does not 
increase to a certain degree, industrial structural reform 
cannot be achieved. Conversely, when the economy is in a virtual 
state of full employment, the transfer of people from 
inefficient to highly competitive sectors is not possible 
because people prefer to stay in the same company instead of 
moving around. In this sense, it may safely be said that the 
modernization of the Japanese economy has been impeded by the 
Japanese policy of securing full employment. 
  The government's duty is not to enable hard-hit companies to 
preserve excess workers by providing subsidies. Nor is it to 
spend taxes collected from workers in competitive industries for 
the sake of inefficient industries. Instead, the government 
should provide vocational training so unemployed workers can 
acquire new skills and have an opportunity to move to newly 
created competitive industries. 
  What the government must do is not adopt a new economic 
stimulus package or implement claptrap measures, namely the 
reduction of income taxes. In Japan, personal financial assets 
total 600 trillion yen. This is twice as much as the GNP. What 
the government must do is mobilize these huge financial 
resources. This will certainly stimulate the economy. 
  Although our financial assets total 600 trillion yen, unlike 
in other countries we cannot buy what we wish in Japan because 
of the high prices. Articles sold at low price are generally 
items we do not want. As we generally live in small houses, our 
closets are already filled to the breaking point with various 
things. Once the huge financial resources are mobilized, the 
economy will recover without fail. We should create a situation 
under which people will be able to buy what they want at a price 
seen as reasonable from an international viewpoint. In other 
words, a recovery of the market mechanism will be sufficient to 
help revive the economy, a market so devised that sellers can 
always deal with buyers. 
<H3>  I Beg Off Fighting a Decisive Battle With the United States 
on the Japanese Homeland </H3>
  The government pays lip service to implementing a package of 
measures designed to pull the economy out of its recession. In 
fact, the government is bent on halting the decrease in land 
prices and maintaining share prices at the current level in 
order to relieve the industrial world. During World War II, the 
Imperial Headquarters used this same tactic. By the irony of 
fate, the government's trick has helped weaken the people's will 
to buy; in other words, it has aggravated the recession. The 
purchase of stocks, land, and other immovables will 
spontaneously become brisk once prices decrease to a reasonable 
level and once there is an abundant supply. In the 1980's, the 
government used to set forth the shortage of labor, or the 
shortage of land, as a premise. It should no longer do this; 
instead it should face up to the reality--that is, the existence 
of surplus labor and surplus land. It should revise the 
taxation system, which is strangely punitive, and abolish the 
complicated procedures needed for approbation and licensing. The 
government has as its primary object the improvement of social 
infrastructure in consumer-oriented areas. Therefore, it should 
channel more public funds into investment aimed at achieving 
this object once the mobilization of private funds is realized. 
If there is a sharp decline in land prices, the construction 
costs of public facilities will be reduced as well. This will 
considerably lighten the taxpayers' burden. 
  In general, people become frugal when they have a smaller 
income. In the case of the Japanese Government, the strange 
thing is that, although a revenue shortfall of 10 trillion yen 
is predicted for this fiscal year, no one proposes curtailing 
spending by 10 trillion yen. The bureaucracy has no intention 
to reduce it, while the business world is crying loudly for 
income tax reductions and a further issuance of government bonds 
to finance construction projects. The government thinks it 
should meet these two requests in some form. 
  This is the weakness of a coalition government. Every year 
each ministry struggles to secure a larger piece of the 
budgetary pie. The ruling coalition, which is a scratch team of 
seven parties and one parliamentary group, has no authority over 
the bureaucracy, so the government cannot but accept a 
bureaucracy-driven draft budget. Here again there is no one who 
can see the situation in perspective and decide to undertake a 
drastic retrenchment in the budget. 
  As long as the Japanese have 600 trillion yen in personal 
financial assets, and as long as they desire a better standard 
of living, hope is not yet dead that Japan will succeed. The 
desire for a better standard of living and a more comfortable 
life leads to the creation of new products. On the contrary, 
the more the government tries to carry out its New Deal--the 
economic stimulus package--by arbitrarily taking money out of 
taxpayers' purse, the more the situation will worsen. 
  In the 1980's, Japan used to be qualified as follows: 
"Economic strength of the first order; administrative ability 
and diplomatic skill of the second order; political technique of 
the third order." Now it seems Japan has become a third-rate 
country in all aspects. The degeneration was mainly caused by 
third-rate politicians who are too intent on political reform to 
think of anything else. 
  I do not want Japan to take the same course the Imperial 
Headquarters followed at the end of World War II. The Imperial 
Headquarters tried to fight a decisive battle on the Japanese 
homeland without seeing the situation in perspective, without 
devising any strategy, and without facing up to the reality that 
Japan's defeat was already evident. I do not want the current 
government to do the same--that is, to try to implement a series 
of pump-priming measures that will only help maintain the cozy 
relationship between politicians, bureaucrats, and business 
leaders.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 22 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The central 
newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs that the State Great Hural spring 
session finished consideration of the draft law on currency. 
The draft law was adopted by the majority of votes and it was 
decided to call it as the law on regulation of currency. The 
law will come into force from 1 May. At the same time adopted 
was the resolution of the State Great Hural on measures on 
realization of this law. At the yesterday's sitting of the 
State Great Hural, consideration of the issue about making 
amendments and additions in the law on elections began. This 
issue has been submitted to the parliament by the President of 
Mongolia P. Ochirbat. The newspaper informs that the Mongolian 
delegation headed by the vice-chairman of the State Great Hural, 
deputy chairman of the Mongolian parliamentary group J. Gombojab 
has left Ulaanbaatar for Paris to attend the regular conference 
of the Interparliamentary Union. The newspaper informs also 
that the Vice-Premier of Mongolia L. Enebish left on a visit to 
Hungary, Czechia and Belgium. L. Enebish is planning to get 
acquainted with the experience of the above-mentioned countries 
in the sphere of state governing and market relations. 
  The newspaper carries an interview of its correspondent with 
the deputy chairman of the standing emergency commission 
Major-General G. Damdinsuren about the situation in 
animal-husbandry. G. Damdinsuren points out to difficult 
weather conditions in Tub Aymag, where there was a heavy 
snow-fall. As G. Damdinsuren notes there will be great 
difficulties in breeding cattle this spring. 
  The newspaper publishes an article by the State Great Hural 
member T. Turmandah apropos of the statements made by the 
representatives of the opposition parties in the parliament, 
concerning involvement of some members of the state leadership 
in corruption. T. Turmandah considers these accusations as 
groundless. 
  The newspaper "HUMUUN BICHIG," which is issued by the 
MONTSAME agency in the old Mongolian script informs about the 
sitting of the state commission on preparation for introduction 
of the traditional Mongolian script in official clerical work. 
In the information it is noted that the Mongolian script will 
be used in clerical work and official correspondence from 1995. 
  The newspaper acquaints the readers with reacclimatization 
of 
wild horses-tahi in the primordial places of their inhabitance. 
Wild horse-tahi is at present only in zoological gardens of 
foreign countries. These countries have sent to Mongolia about 
20 wild horses, which are being acclimatized in the Gobi regions 
of the country. 
  The newspaper continues publishing the exercises for those 
learning the old Mongolian script, texts for reading.

<F P=106> [By Katsuhiro Kuroda] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, 18 Mar -- Some 200 people were killed during 
massive explosions at a missile plant in the DPRK (North Korea) 
in November 1991, a defector from North Korea told SANKEI 
SHIMBUN on 18 March. The explosion occurred in Kanggye in 
Chagang Province where military plants are concentrated. In 
addition to the loss of life, the accident destroyed several 
buildings in the city. The "Kanggye No. 26 General Plant" was 
North Korea's largest underground facility built in mountain 
tunnels with a total of 20,000 people employed there; missile 
assembly sites and other functions were reportedly removed 
following the accident. 
  SANKEI SHIMBUN obtained these comments from Ko Chong-song, 
32, who lived in Kanggye and defected to the Republic of Korea 
via China last June. During a three-year period beginning in 
1984, Ko daily went to the plant as a boxer with membership in 
the plant's "sports team." Moreover, his two brothers were 
serving as the accounting department chief and an engineer; he 
also had many friends working there. Therefore, he was familiar 
with the internal affairs of the plant. 
  According to Ko, the first explosion occurred around 2130 
[1230 GMT] on 30 November. His apartment was approximately 2 
kilometers from the plant and was blocked by a hill, but he 
reported that the terrible noise and vibrations emanating from 
the explosion were like those of an earthquake. The night sky 
turned red with fire, and explosions continued until 1030 [0130 
GMT] the next morning. The blasts shattered the windows of his 
apartment, and many houses in the city were destroyed or burned. 
  The accident occurred at an outdoor materials dump near no. 
11 missile assembly site. Mishandling of explosives set off a 
fire which touched off a series of blasts among missiles and 
artillery ordinance. The official death toll was put at 127, 
but it was rumored among citizens that the toll should be about 
200, including civilian casualties. 
  Immediately after the incident, a "suicide squad" was 
organized to seal off the entrance to the tunnel to prevent 
explosions from spreading inside the underground complex; some 
20 volunteers were killed during the attempt. Five were later 
awarded the title "Heroes of the Republic." 
  Following the incident, many party and government leaders-- 
including then-Premier Yon Hyong-mok, Korean Workers' Party 
[KWP] Secretary (in charge of military supplies) Kim Chang-ho, 
and KWP Second Economic Commission Chairman Kim 
Man-song--inspected the plant. Kanggye was sealed off for 20 
days following the accident, and a strict news blackout was 
imposed on the area. 
  In addition to missiles, the plant was producing various 
munitions, including rocket bombs, depth charges, torpedoes, and 
mines. Surface-to-air, surface-to-surface, and air-to-surface 
missiles were respectively codenamed "Hwasong [Mars] 1, 2, and 
3"; they possessed a range of up to 200 kilometers. Ko noted 
the plant is presently producing a new missile with a range of 
over 550 kilometers. 
  All products of the plant were originally designed in the 
former Soviet Union. They are exported mainly to Iran and other 
Middle East countries. Plant personnel used to say: "The 
Iran-Iraq War was a field experiment for our weapons." 
  The plant is built at the foot of a rocky mountain and is 2 
kilometers in width. Production sections and assembly sites are 
located inside the tunnels, and non-production sections such as 
material dumps and management offices are located outside. 
  Chagang Province is a mountainous region in North Korea 
adjoining the Chinese border. North Korea's military industries 
are concentrated in the region, and civilian traffic is strictly 
controlled. Under such circumstances, the accident has been 
kept secret until now.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Thailand/Italy: Confindustria </F>
Forges Accord"] 
  [Text] Bangkok, 21 Mar (ANSA) -- In the course of a visit 
here, the head of a CONFINDUSTRIA [General Confederation of 
Italian Industry] delegation (of Italian industrialists), 
Rosolino Orlando signed an accord for economic, industrial and 
technological cooperation with the Federation of Thai Industries. 
  Orlando said over the weekend that he envisaged immediate 
forms of cooperation in the fields of food, machine tools, 
metalworking and woodworking. Thai industrialists will be 
taking part in Italian trade fairs and will make use of Italy's 
experience in professional training at intermediate levels. 
  During his visit, Orlando met with Thai business leaders and 
with the deputy ministers for foreign trade and for industry. 
The CONFINDUSTRIA delegation included bankers as well as 
industrialists. 
  Italian exports to Thailand markedly increased in 1993, 
reaching the sum of 1.4 trillion lire (833 million dollars). 
Furthermore, the direct presence of Italian industry in the 
fields of steel, energy, installations and construction has 
deepened. 
  In fact, Thailand is ever more strongly seen as a focal 
point 
of growing importance in terms of Italian economic activities 
towards Indochina.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 23 KYODO -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu, originally scheduled to accompany 
President Kim Yong-sam on his visit to Tokyo on Thursday, will 
not make the trip, the Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. No 
reason was offered for Han's last-minute withdrawal from the 
traveling party, but ministry sources noted that it is likely 
related to the increasingly tense situation on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Han's meeting with his Japanese counterpart Tsutomu Hata, 
also scheduled for Thursday, was also canceled, the ministry 
said. 
  Kim will be in Tokyo for a three-day visit beginning 
Thursday 
to meet with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and then will 
travel to China for meetings with Beijing leaders. Talks with 
Hosokawa and Chinese leaders are expected to focus on resolving 
North Korea's refusal to permit adequate inspections of its 
nuclear facilities.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 23 KYODO -- Sino-Japanese civil 
aviation talks aimed at increasing regular flights between the 
two countries have broken down over China's insistence on the 
principle of reciprocity, Transport Ministry officials said 
Wednesday [23 March]. The officials said China rejected Japan's 
request for an increase in the number of flights to Beijing, 
insisting Japan accept the same number of Chinese flights to 
Tokyo's international airport at Narita. 
  Japan told China it is physically impossible to accept the 
Chinese demand because Narita airport is equipped with only one 
runway, they said. 
  Currently, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways operate 
twice-weekly regular flights to Beijing while Japan Air System 
hopes to join them. 
  Two Chinese airlines, which now fly into Narita, Osaka and 
Fukuoka, want to increase their flights on the lucrative Narita 
route, the officials said. No resumption of negotiations is 
possible as long as China insists on increasing flights to 
Narita, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 23 KYODO -- The government's new 
economic package designed to provide greater access to the 
Japanese market for foreign products will include plans for 
continuous income tax cuts and greater expenditures for public 
works projects, government sources said Wednesday [23 March]. 
  The sources said the government of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa plans to complete the package by the end of March to 
pave the way for resumption of stalled negotiations with the 
United States on a new framework for bilateral trade. 
Washington strongly demanded income tax cuts on a continuous 
basis as part of macroeconomic measures to promote Japanese 
imports and slash the country's swollen trade surplus. 
  The sources said the package will also include a further 
increase in outlays for public works projects over the 430 
trillion yen called for under the present program. The size of 
the increment will be decided by the end of June when the 
government will prepare another round of market-opening 
measures, the sources said. 
  They said the government hopes the new package, to be worked 
out by the end of this month, will satisfy the U.S. and pave the 
way for resumption of trade negotiations between the two 
countries. The program will include measures for areas of 
principal U.S. interest, such as participation in government 
procurement, imports of automobile and auto parts and 
deregulation of the insurance industry, the sources said. 
  Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister in charge of 
economic affairs, told a news conference earlier Wednesday that 
measures for deregulation in the three priority areas are now 
being scrutinized in response to Hosokawa's instruction. 
  Hayashi warned Japan will take retaliatory action under 
rules 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if Washington 
imposes sanctions on the country on grounds of unfair trade 
practices.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 23 KYODO -- Gaishi Hiraiwa, one of 
Japan's key business moguls, on Wednesday [23 March] defended 
the tight-fisted stance of management in this spring's wage 
negotiations, which will likely result in the poorest-ever wage 
hikes. 
  Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations 
(Keidanren), told a news conference that the results of this 
year's spring labor offensive should be judged from a more 
overall perspective. "I doubt the wisdom of picking up only 
wages and comparing the sizes of their hikes," he said. 
  Wage negotiations in such key industries as steel and 
electric machinery makers have entered the final stage, with 
substantially low wage increases agreed or cited thus far. 
  Asked about the state of the economy, Hiraiwa said its 
recovery will come late this year or early next year. 
  Although some bright signs have started to appear, including 
the pickup in industrial production, housing starts and personal 
consumption, there still remain some worrisome factors, such as 
the slump in the real estate sector and the yen's appreciation, 
he said. "Transactions in commercial properties remain 
sluggish, while the worries over a possible spurt of the yen 
linger. Corporations are still in the middle of cutting labor 
and facilities," he said. 
  Warning against premature optimism, Hiraiwa also noted the 
possibility of a downturn of the economy in the spring. "Last 
year, many people predicted the economy bottomed out in March, 
but the yen's subsequent rise pulled it down in the April-June 
period. We cannot deny the possibility this year, too," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 23 KYODO -- More evidence emerged 
Wednesday [23 March] that Japanese business sentiment is halting 
its decline, with a Finance Ministry survey showing improvements 
in long-slumping confidence. The ministry's quarterly index of 
current business sentiment at major firms improved to minus 13.1 
in the survey conducted in February from minus 22.1 in the 
previous survey taken in November. 
  The earlier figure was the worst recorded in the current 
economic downturn. 
  The survey for the first quarter, like the Bank of Japan's 
most recent "tankan" survey also taken in February, "seems to 
show a halt to the declines" in business sentiment, a ministry 
official said. "From these numbers alone it would seem that the 
economy has hit bottom, but we must see if the trend continues" 
in subsequent data, he said. 
  The minus readings, which show the difference between the 
percentages of respondents seeing improvement and those seeing 
decline, also declined in the medium and small business sectors, 
according to the survey of 9,310 companies, of which 85 percent 
responded. 
  Overall, sentiment is improving, the official said, citing 
corporate restructuring and downsizing efforts. But he 
acknowledged a similar improvement in the survey figures a year 
ago. 
  At that time, signs of a turnaround were dashed by such 
factors as a surge in the yen's value, unseasonably bad summer 
weather and a series of construction scandals. The official 
said some of the February figures were collected before and some 
after a failed Japan-U.S. summit that saw trade tensions prompt 
another yen surge. 
  Major firms predicted the sentiment index will improve to 
minus 4.6 next quarter and to a plus 5.3 in the July-September 
period. 
  Sentiment at large manufacturers improved to minus 15.5 in 
the first quarter from minus 27.3, with predictions of 
improvement to minus 5.5 in the quarter starting next month and 
to plus 5.7 in the subsequent period. 
  Large nonmanufacturers reported an improvement to minus 10.8 
in the current quarter from minus 17.8 and predicted 
improvements to minus 3.9 and plus 4.9. 
  Nonmanufacturers, especially the service sector, led the way 
in improving sales and profits, the ministry survey found. 
  All respondents, which also included medium-sized and 
smaller 
firms, expect pretax profits to fall 13.9 percent in the fiscal 
year ending this month, with sales slipping 2.8 percent. But 
they see profits rising 12.5 percent in the first half of the 
coming fiscal year and sales edging up 0.3 percent. 
  Manufacturers predicted fiscal 1993 pretax profit falls of 
25.2 percent with sales dropping 4.4 percent and a first-half 
profit pickup of 10.1 percent with sales curbing their declines 
to 1.2 percent. 
  Among all nonmanufacturers, profits are expected to decline 
in this fiscal year, with sales slipping 2.2 percent, but climb 
13.7 percent in the first half of fiscal 1994, with sales rising 
0.9 percent. 
  Service companies see pretax profits rising 0.2 percent this 
fiscal year, with sales up 1.6 percent, and jumping 22.2 percent 
in the first half of fiscal 1994 as sales rise 2.4 percent. 
  Labor conditions, however, continued to worsen, according to 
the survey index that gauges the difference between the 
percentage of companies reporting a labor surplus and those 
seeing a shortage. 
  At major firms, the index weakened to minus 21.3, the worst 
since the ministry began conducting the survey in 1983, from 
19.6 in the November survey. It was almost flat at medium-size 
companies, inching up to minus 13.6 from minus 13.7, and dipped 
to plus 0.5 at smaller firms from plus 1.5. 
  "The sense of surplus increased slightly," the official 
said, 
but he added that labor conditions are a lagging indicator of 
the state of the economy. All groups in the survey forecast 
improved labor conditions in the coming two quarters.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 23 KYODO -- Japan's production of 
cars, trucks and buses in February dropped 14.1 percent from a 
year before to 896,097 units for the 17th straight year-to-year 
fall, an industry association reported Wednesday [23 March]. 
The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said February 
marked the sixth straight month of double-digit yearly falls, a 
postwar record. 
  The association said exports dropped an estimated 24.0 
percent from the year before level. 
  It said the February figure brought to 9,795,219 vehicles 
the 
total vehicle production for the first 11 months of fiscal 1993, 
down 12.3 percent from the like period of the preceding year. 
The association said the February output included 677,993 
passenger cars, down 14.5 percent from a year earlier, extending 
the yearly decline to 11 straight months. 
  Production of trucks declined for the 31st month in a row, 
decreasing 13.0 percent from a year earlier to 213,973 units, 
the association said. Output of buses accounted for 4,131 
units, down 9.2 percent, it said. 
  The association said domestic sales in February declined 6.2 
percent from a year earlier to 519,253 units, with passenger 
cars accounting for 345,772, down 6.8 percent. 
  Sales of trucks totaled 172,240 units, down 4.9 percent, and 
those of buses were down 14.7 percent at 1,241, the association 
said. 
  The association said production of Toyota Motor Corp., 
leader 
of the industry, dropped 12.3 percent to 279,522 vehicles, while 
Nissan Motor Co.'s production totaled 142,965, down 13.4 
percent. The association said all other major automakers 
reported a double-digit fall in production in February. 
  The association said motorcycle output in the month was down 
17.2 percent from a year before at 232,004 units, posting the 
11th straight month of year-to-year falls. 
  Cumulative production for the 11 months from April last year 
totaled 2,621,912 units, down 10.2 percent, the association said. 
  It said domestic shipments declined 3.5 percent while 
exports 
plunged an estimated 15 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 23 KYODO -- Michio Watanabe, former 
foreign minister and a heavyweight in the main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), urges political forces favoring 
the "public interest" to unite in a book to go on sale next 
month. The outspoken politician predicts in his book "The New 
Conservative Revolution" that the country's political forces 
will divide into two in the future -- one that places priority 
on the public interest and one that is at the mercy of public 
opinion. 
  Demanding that the coalition of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa be dissolved, Watanabe urges "public interest" 
political forces to unite against others which he claims merely 
go along with the current of the times. 
  Watanabe criticizes the Hosokawa coalition of seven parties 
ranging from conservatives to reformists, saying, "parties with 
different basic ideas cannot do anything." He proposes 
realigning the LDP and four coalition parties -- Shinseito, 
Komeito, the Japan New Party (JNP) of Hosokawa, and the new 
party Sakigake -- into two conservative groups. 
  Watanabe, who was both deputy premier and foreign minister 
under the government of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa from 1991 
to 1993, also sanctioned dissolving the LDP to help create "the 
two conservative forces." 
  Shinseito and Sakigake are mainly made up of LDP defectors. 
  Shinseito and the Buddhist-backed Komeito are also seeking 
to 
establish a two-party system of the LDP and a new rival party to 
be made up of non-LDP forces, including Shinseito and Komeito. 
  Hosokawa, whose coalition was inaugurated last August when 
the LDP lost its 38-year grip on power, is reportedly tilting in 
favor of ties with the Shinseito-Komeito camp, shifting from 
close relations with Sakigake which is in favor of a multiparty 
system, though fewer than the current number. 
  The three other coalition parties are the Social Democratic 
Party (SDP), the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and the minor 
United Social Democratic Party (USDP). The SDP and the DSP are 
in line with Sakigake on political realignment. 
  Ichiro Ozawa, the alliance's chief strategist and 
Shinseito's 
secretary general, and Masayoshi Takemura, Sakigake's leader, 
have also published books discussing the future of politics in 
Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 23 KYODO -- A senior Foreign Ministry 
official said Wednesday Japan will work out a market-opening 
package by the end of this month to prepare for early resumption 
of framework trade talks with the United States. 
  Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister in charge of 
economic affairs, told a news conference that measures for 
deregulation in priority areas such as government procurement, 
automobile and auto parts imports and insurance now are being 
scrutinized at the order of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
Hayashi added, however, that it would be difficult to complete 
a comprehensive package comprising all priority areas as well as 
policies for free competition. 
  Referring to a U.S. threat to take retaliatory action 
against 
Japan under the controversial Super 301 clause, Hayashi said it 
is natural for Japan to seek judgment from the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) if such a step is invoked. Hayashi 
added Japan is allowed to take countermeasures against such 
moves under GATT rules.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 23 KYODO -- Gas industry leaders said 
Wednesday [23 March] the industry will promote competition in 
line with recommendations shown in a recent government panel 
report. Top officials of the Japan Gas Association made the 
pledge during a breakfast meeting with Hiroshi Kumagai, 
international trade and industry minister. 
  Association chief Hiroshi Watanabe said the industry will 
make efforts to serve the interest both of customers and regions 
while enhancing competition under deregulation of government 
controls. The government panel unveiled a report in late 
January, calling for flexible price setting for large-lot gas 
users and new entries into the gas business. 
  The industry will redouble efforts to reinforce its earnings 
base in order to secure a stable gas supply, said Watanabe, also 
chairman of Tokyo Gas Co. 
  Referring to a recent spell of explosions and other 
accidents, MITI chief Kumagai asked the leaders to make the 
industry safer. The industry will take adequate steps based on 
the January recommendations, Watanabe said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's cabinet decided Friday [18 March] on a bill that 
would require employers to set the retirement age for employees 
at 60, starting in fiscal 1998. 
  The bill, to be sent soon to the Diet for approval, 
stipulates the retirement age should "not be below 60" but 
exempts jobs which are considered difficult for older workers. 
  It also gives the labor minister the authority to recommend 
that employers secure jobs for employees until 65. 
  The bill, which would revise a law on job security for older 
workers, also contains a relaxation of restrictions on the kinds 
of jobs temporary workers are permitted to perform. 
  Under existing law, temporary staff are allowed for only 16 
kinds of jobs, such as translators and secretaries, but the bill 
would expand the scope for older workers to include all jobs 
except cargo handling at ports, construction and security.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- Iceland's Prime Minister 
David Oddsson said Tuesday [22 March] his country plans to 
resume commercial whaling in the "near future" but has not 
decided when. "The problem is the possibility of selling whale 
meat," Oddsson told a news conference, alluding to an 
international ban on trade in whale products. 
  "We could never eat all the whales we would like to hunt," 
said Oddsson, who is in Japan for an informal visit to accompany 
the national soccer team for friendship matches with Japan's 
J-league. Iceland has a population of 260,000. 
  As a "very small economy" the fishing nation also must take 
into account possible reactions of antiwhaling groups, he said. 
"For organizations like Greenpeace it is very easy to hit a 
country like us," he said. 
  In 1989 Iceland halted whaling after environmentalists 
called 
for an international boycott of Icelandic products. Frustrated 
over a moratorium on commercial whaling decreed by the 
International Whaling Commission (IWC) in 1985, Iceland withdrew 
from the organization in 1991. 
  Iceland will consider rejoining the IWC if it "will change 
its methods," he said charging that the commission has been 
taken over by antiwhaling interests and "terrorist groups like 
Greenpeace." The IWC must "realize" that it is possible to 
catch whales without risking overhunting, Oddsson said. 
  The 40-member IWC at its annual meeting in Kyoto in May 
rejected a set of rules devised to allow controlled harvesting 
of nonthreatened whale species, known as revised management 
procedure, dashing pro-whaling nations' hopes for a lifting of 
the whaling ban. 
  If the ban remains in place, the increasing number of whales 
will threaten the stock of other fish vital for Iceland's 
economy, the premier said. But he said "things are changing," 
noting increasing support for the idea of controlled culling of 
whales during the past two years. 
  That the United States, while ardently protesting against 
IWC-member Norway's resumption of small-scale commercial whaling 
in June 1993, did not act on its threats indicated that 
Washington is shifting from its antiwhaling position, he said. 
  However, Oddsson said he does not plan to discuss the 
whaling 
issue in talks with Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
scheduled for later Tuesday and declined to comment on Japan's 
whaling policy. At last year's IWC meeting Iceland called on 
Japan and Norway to quit the commission. 
  Japan has abided by the ban on commercial whaling but 
catches 
a limited number of whales in Antarctic waters each year for 
what it says is for scientific reasons. Japan's whaling fleet 
is currently carrying out its annual research mission to the 
Antarctic to hunt its permitted quota of some 330 minke whales 
while monitoring blue whales.

  [Text] Honolulu Sat.-- Malaysia has urged developed nations 
to give developing Asian nations a break with regard to human 
rights issues. 
  Deputy Prime Minister [PM] Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim conveyed 
this message to U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen today. 
  "Give us a break. Fair enough we want to establish 
democracies and believe in the principle of human rights, 
although the perception may differ slightly. 
  "But have a better understanding, listen a bit more 
establish 
an effective channel of communication and rapport among 
countries and cultures," Anwar said he told Bentsen. 
  Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said this in reply to a 
question from the foreign Press about Malaysia's views on human 
rights and U.S. moves to set human rights standards for the 
Chinese. 
  Anwar, however, made it clear that he was not making a 
particular reference to the Chinese but that he generally felt 
there was a need to show a great deal more tolerance. 
  Asked what would happen if this was not done, Anwar replied: 
"Then you come out with very crude tough pronouncements or 
policies. 
  "And worse still if you use trade and aid issues to force 
down the throats of leaders and countries so that they see your 
point of view. I think what we need is dialogue and persuasion." 
  Anwar told a packed conference room that there were some 
serious problems of complexities in some countries. 
  He added that this was not an exaggeration and neither was 
it 
an issue meant to condone the excesses of other countries. 
  But there was a need to understand the concerns and views of 
others. 
  "There is nothing stopping us in democratic societies with a 
free Press to highlight issues. But of course we differ if 
these are taken as judgment or conclusion that will influence 
policies of the powerful world against the developing world in 
particular." 
  Anwar said Malaysia did not condone any sort of oppression 
or 
depression but added that to assume that some countries "have 
the sole monopoly and understanding of what constitutes 
democracy and human rights is certainly a very false arrogance." 
  "In this multi cultural and pluralistic world, we have to 
appreciate predicaments, problems and complexities of various 
countries and cultures." 
  Asked whether Bentsen tried to persuade him to take a more 
positive view of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), 
Anwar replied that Malaysia had always had a positive view of 
APEC. 
  "However, we do not believe that it should be 
institutionalised." he added. 
  Asked about the liberalisation of financial markets and 
possible moves by the U.S. to seek greater opening of these 
sectors in Asian countries, Anwar said Malaysia would not move 
backwards but move forward adding that it was the manner and the 
speed that was the issue. 
  "As a principle I think developing countries must be given 
some lead time to start their infrastructure and gather enough 
experience before we can move further ahead". 
  Anwar had explained to Bensten at the World Bank IMF meeting 
that most foreign banks had operations in Malaysia and to a 
large extent continued to do so. 
  "But to further liberalise means that they will not have 
free 
competition at all because we will have to give some leeway to 
allow for locals to have some experience before they can 
continue to compete. 
  "What we are asking is for some breathing space. 
  "It is not an issue whether to open or not. The question is 
whether to continue to further liberalise, it's already quite 
liberal." 
  "Even now 16 of the 36 banks in Malaysia are foreign and 
some 
30 percent of total deposits in Malaysia are with the foreign 
banks. 
  "To say that countries in the region are not giving access 
to 
their financial markets is not true. It is a question of access 
to what extent that is given at that particular time". 
  In terms of capital flows and the resultant impact on the 
economy, Anwar said there was speculation in the stock market 
and the ringgit [Malaysian currency]. 
  "These are normal problems of success. If people believe in 
the ringgit and speculate in the ringgit then what do we do? 
"But I think getting more information and to see and learn from 
their experiences will be a great help in managing our economy," 
he said.

  [Text] Honolulu, Sun.-- Every country has the right to 
determine its own destiny and should have the freedom to choose 
appropriate development and social strategies Deputy Prime 
Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said today. 
  He said each country had to set its own priorities when 
confronted with a multitude of challenges and opportunities. 
  Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said that as the 
economy 
was becoming increasingly globalised and confronted with the 
reality of multiculturalism, its growth was inextricably linked 
to factors beyond economics. 
  Anwar told this to Finance Ministers of the Asia Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) which met here yesterday. He was 
speaking on Malaysia's economic growth strategies. 
  Anwar, however, told the meeting: "Trade must not infringe 
on the rights of peoples and nations towards their own values 
and cultures. If we want the pursuit of growth to be a vehicle 
to spread out prosperity, rather than becoming an agent for 
domination, it has to be conducted with the full cognizance of 
the diversity of our world. 
  "The quest for stability is not an excuse for suppression 
and 
injustices." 
  Anwar said the implementation and the continuity of 
pro-growth policies and market-friendly institutional reforms 
were only possible within a stable political environment. 
  He pointed out that diligence, discipline, and a hardworking 
labour force -- qualities which had contributed to East Asia's 
prosperity and improved living standards -- had earned the 
contempt of some in the West, especially among labour unions. 
  "Some have gone as far as to conjure the absurd nightmare of 
Western civilisation being threatened by low wage economies. I 
must say that no Government with a modicum of sense and 
responsibility would like to see its own people languishing in 
sweatshops," Anwar said. 
  He added that for a country with full employment like 
Malaysia, no measures to suppress wages would be successful. 
The challenge was to remain competitive and to ensure that wage 
increases did not outstrip gains in productivity. 
  "For us in Asia, growth through productivity and 
competitiveness is the only path to achieve prosperity. It has 
liberated millions from the scourge of poverty and destitution. 
It will liberate millions more in future," he added. 
  In Malaysia's case, the high growth had resulted in the 
incidence of poverty declining from nearly 50 percent in 1970 to 
14 percent today and per capita incomes increased significantly 
from a mere U.S.$250 in 1957 to more than U.S.$3,000 by 1993. 
  He told the other 17 Finance Ministers that economic growth 
had enabled the people in East Asia to enjoy freedom and decent 
living conditions -- an indigenously-generated vision of 
opportunity and betterment that compared favourably with the 
promised idylls of the divergent package deals offered by 
various political persuasions. 
  Malaysia's view, Anwar said, was that growth could not and 
must not be separated from the overall societal objectives. 
"However widely crafted and market-friendly these policies may 
be, consideration of the issues of distributive justice and 
fairness will, eventually, play their part in contributing to 
growth." 
  Malaysia's success in economic development, with six 
consecutive years of growth exceeding eight percent, underscored 
the importance of political stability, sound macro-economic 
management and an open, market-based economy that was largely 
private sector driven. 
  Anwar explained that the Government's multi-year structural 
adjustment programme in the 1980s down-sized the role of the 
public sector and promoted private initiative as the main engine 
of growth. 
  On Malaysia's economic performance in 1994, he said 
indications were that the economy would strengthen further with 
growth exceeding eight percent "making this the most buoyant and 
longest economic expansion in Malaysia's history." 
  Both the Government's financial and balance of payments 
position were looking very healthy. Inflation was low and price 
stability was expected to continue, he said. 
  Prospects for the medium term were equally good and the 
growth target of eight percent for the Sixth Malaysia Plan 
(1991-1995) would most probably be surpassed. Nevertheless, 
there was a need to continuously focus on relieving 
infrastructural bottlenecks and shortage of skilled labour to 
enhance competitiveness. 
  Even though East Asia had been insulated from the recession 
in the industrialised countries, it was not oblivious to the 
fact that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) countries were and would remain a major 
contributor to the global economy. 
  Developing countries would benefit from a "rejuvenation of 
growth in older industralised economies. 
  "If we can free ourselves of protectionism and reverse the 
movement towards the formation of new trading blocs, we can 
develop a new partnership, one which can operate to disperse 
growth and prosperity around the globe. 
  "There is no miracle agent or quick-fix for growth, it is 
the 
outcome of hard work and diligence, continuous investment in 
human and physical capital and policies that promote 
entrepreneurship." 
  Anwar said this had been Malaysia's experience and that 
there 
was a need to be "wary of the residual mentality of the Cold War 
era and outlook that seeks to exaggerate security issues and 
provoke tensions, thus once again diverting our energies from 
development." 
  He told the Ministers that ASEAN's experience had taught 
that 
regional stability and productive relations must be earned 
through good neighbourliness and mutual trust.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 23 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- A senior 
Malaysian minister is hopeful the Malaysia-initiated East Asia 
Economic Caucus (EAEC), initiated by Malaysia and which is 
currently on a membership drive, will take off before the end of 
next year. 
  Rafidah Aziz, who is trade and industry minister, said the 
grouping would comprise the ASEAN members in the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation, and Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the new 
market economies in Indochina. 
  She hoped that the grouping would be launched before the 
18th 
PECC [Pacific Economic Cooperation Council] general meeting 
which will be held in 18 months' time. 
  The decision to form this loose informal grouping was born 
out of the necessity to maximise the potential in the East Asian 
region and opposing perceptions to the EAEC are coloured by 
non-economic factors, she said here. 
  The ASEAN Secretriat is in the midst of talks with the 
potential launch members towards determining the objectives of 
the grouping. 
  The reasons behind the formation of the EAEC are basic and 
sane, she reiterated while assuaging fears that the grouping 
would evolve into a trade bloc. 
  Speaking from the perspective of East Asia and open 
regionalism, she pointed out the trade and investment 
inter-dependence in East Asia was equally significant when 
compared with the region's trade with the rest of the world. 
  We are all export-led economies, she said to underscore the 
fact that the proposed grouping would remain a loose 
consultative forum and consistent with the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  On APEC, she said that group had strayed from its original 
objective into a new format, heightened by the informal leaders 
summit in Seattle.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 23 KYODO -- A Japanese partner 
in Malaysia's second national car project pledged Wednesday [23 
March] to impart its technology faster than in the first project 
that involves another Japanese automaker. 
  The assurance by a senior Daihatsu Motor Co. official 
followed Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed's complaint Monday that 
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. has been slow in transferring its engine 
and transmission technology to its Malaysian partners in Proton. 
  Daihatsu is scheduled to begin producing 660cc minicars 
modeled on the Mira in July, initially procuring about 50 
percent of parts locally for the "Perodua Kancil" model. 
  Perodua derives from the second national car maker's Malay 
name while kancil (mouse deer) is the car's pet name. 
  "We hope to achieve the 75 percent local content target in 
the Perodua Kancil earlier than the 1997 schedule," Daihatsu 
general manager Kentaro Shimizu was quoted as saying by the 
national BERNAMA NEWS AGENCY. 
  "We will increase the transfer of technology from the 
production of engines, machinery, parts and transmission systems 
gradually to plant construction and the sales area," he said.

<F P=106> [By Warren Fernande and Brendan Pereira] </F>
  [Text] Defence lawyer Michael Khoo yesterday rejected a 
suggestion by the prosecution that his client had admitted 
communicating secret information to a BUSINESS TIMES [BT] 
reporter. 
  Such a suggestion was based on a selective reading of 
statements by Crosby Securities analyst, Manu Bhaskaran, to the 
Internal Security Department, he said on day 37 of the Official 
Secrets Act trial. 
  He was referring to the prosecution's written submissions 
which had mentioned Bhaskaran's "admission of a direct 
communication of the flash estimate" to BT journalist Kenneth 
James. 
  Mr. Khoo described this as a "phantom admission", saying it 
did not exist in his client's statements. 
  Bhaskaran, he noted, had told James that he came arross the 
4.6 percent figure inadvertently and did not know it was the 
official flash estimate. 
  He had doubts about it because he thought the figure was too 
low. 
  This did not amount to an admission that he had communicated 
official data, Mr. Khoo argued. 
  Attorney-General Chan Sek Beong countered that the lawyer 
had 
taken his submission out of context. 
  The prosecution's argument was that whatever Bhaskaran now 
said, he had sighted the 4.6 percent figure, which turned out to 
be the official flash estimate. 
  Mr. Khoo replied: "It may well be that the 4.6 figure was 
the 
flash estimate. But my client is not charged with having made a 
good guess of what it was, but with communicating it. The fact 
that it turned out to be the flash estimate is irrelevant." 
  Bhaskaran faces one charge of receiving the official flash 
estimate and two of communicating it. 
  Continuing his submission yesterday, Mr. Khoo said there 
were 
other instances in which the prosecution had relied on parts of 
his client's statements, while ignoring others. This was wholly 
untenable, he said, urging the court to read the statements in 
in context. 
  He also maintained that the prosecution had failed to 
produce 
evidence to prove that Bhaskaran was BT's source of the data. 
  The information was widely known among BT staffers and could 
have come from elsewhere, he said. 
  James could have been mistaken when he told a colleague that 
Bhaskaran was his source. He had told Bhaskaran that he woke up 
one night with the thought that the analyst "was not the one", 
the lawyer noted. 
  Besides, noted Mr. Khoo, Bhaskaran is alleged to have told 
James about the flash estimate for the overall economy only. 
  But, after speaking with one of its reporters, chief 
statistician Paul Cheung had concluded that BT knew about the 
growth figures for various sectors of the economy as well. 
  It was possible some other source, and not Bhaskaran, had 
leaked both the sectoral figures and the official flash estimate 
to BT, he said. 
  BT correspondent Anna Teo had also told Mr. Lai Seck Khui, 
the deputy secretary of the Ministry of Trade and Industry, that 
BT had obtained the information from government sources, he 
added. 
  The prosecution is expected to respond to his submissions 
later this week.

  [Text] Brigadier General Nhean Manou, Khmer Royal Armed 
Forces [KRAF] General Staff spokesman, said on the afternoon of 
22 March that the KRAF is able to attack effectively and occupy 
Khmer Rouge-controlled areas to end their secession. 
  Commenting on a BANGKOK POST report saying that the 
government forces had used chemical weapons in the Pailin 
onslaught, the KRAF spokesman said the royal government has 
never purchased any chemical weapons and that no chemical 
weapons have ever been supplied by another country during the 
war. He pointed out that in the Anlung Veng and Pailin areas as 
well as in (?Kompong Thom Province), more than 10 KRAF 
combatants have died after drinking water from streams and ponds 
poisoned by the Khmer Rouge. 
  Regarding the Khmer Rouge strategy, the general said after 
the attacks on Anlung Veng and Pailin, their biggest 
strongholds, the Khmer Rouge have regrouped at Malai in order to 
plan their last- ditch strategy to further their destructive war 
against the nation as they have done in the past.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "In the Boxing Ring With the Khmer </F>
Rouge"] 
  [Text] With a spirit of national reconciliation and unity, 
the royal government has repeatedly called on the opinionated 
Khmer Rouge to stop the war and return to the national 
community. The group, however, continues to refuse and ignore 
the offers. Moreover, it has also accused First Prime Minister 
Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh of causing the failure of 
talks in the past. Now the group is nearing an irreversible 
point where it will inevitably face a danger, since the Khmer 
Royal Armed Forces have pledged to preserve the unity of the 
country. 
  The Khmer Rouge should correct their mistakes and proceed 
along the right path by being content with national 
reconciliation. With promised aid worth nearly $1,800 million, 
it would be wise for the Khmer Rouge to join the national 
community to serve the country and rebuild it toward glory. It 
is certain that difficulties still remain. However, if the 
former warring parties, such as the FUNCINPEC [National United 
Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative 
Cambodia] Party, the Cambodian People's Party, and the Buddhist 
Liberal Democratic Party, can forget past differences and unite 
for the interests of the nation and people, the Khmer Rouge 
should follow their fine model and join them. This will 
certainly allow all of them to live in prosperity.

  [Text] At 0600 on 22 March, the people and National Army 
of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] jointly attacked and totally 
routed the forces of the Vietnamese communist puppets and 
two-headed government at Bavel district seat [Battambang 
Province] and totally liberated Bavel District. 
  These forces of the Vietnamese communist puppets and 
two-headed government are from the right-wing frontline 
headquarters located along the bank of the Mongkol Borei river 
[words indistinct] Sala Krau within the framework of the 
offensive to seize Pailin. The people and NADK, however, having 
grasped the plan of the Vietnamese communist puppets and 
two-headed government, smashed this important headquarters of 
them. We killed 12 enemy soldiers, wounded 19, and captured 12 
others; destroyed 36 assorted weapons; and seized a T-54 tank, 
two (?37-mm guns), a 85-mm cannon, two 12.7-mm guns, 17 AK 
rifles, five B-40's, 12 Ar-15's, and a quantity of ammunition.

<F P=106> ["Statement by National Army of Democratic Kampuchea </F>
spokesman rejecting the communique of the Vietnamese puppets and 
two-headed government on their seizure of Pailin"; dated 22 
March -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] I. The Vietnamese communist puppets and the 
two-headed government clamorously announced in Phnom Penh, 
Battambang, and Treng that they have seized Pailin. Meanwhile, 
some foreign news agencies and newspapers have echoed this 
announcement of the Vietnamese communist puppets and the 
two-headed government in an evil intention to deceive the 
national and international public opinion just as they did 
concerning the Anlung Veng battlefield. 
  II. Many observers and journalists stressed, however, that 
they had been waiting several days for permission to go to 
Pailin, but the Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed 
government did not allow them to go. They waited in Battambang 
and Treng for several days, but they did not reach Pailin. 
Therefore, they assumed that the Vietnamese puppets had not yet 
seized Pailin as they claimed. The Vietnamese communist puppets 
and the two-headed government lied. They also reported that on 
the Route 10-Pailin battlefield, many attacking troops of the 
Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government were 
killed and wounded. The routed troops who retreated from the 
battlefield said that hundreds of their colleagues were killed 
and wounded. Several hundred other wounded troops were 
hospitalized. The attacking troops died in battle and also due 
to a shortage of water and food, while hundreds deserted their 
ranks. Those deserters also said that the Vietnamese communist 
puppets and the two-headed government lied to them that their 
troops were fighting on the front line; but, in fact, they were 
very far from Pailin. 
  III. The spokesman of the National Army of Democratic 
Kampuchea [NADK] would like to stress to the national and 
international audience that: 
  A. Not a single soldier of the Vietnamese communist puppets 
and the two-headed government was able to enter Pailin city. 
Presently, Pailin remains under the control of Democratic 
Kampuchea in an orderly manner. 
  B. We would like to inform the national and international 
audience that the Vietnamese communist puppets, two-headed 
government, and their masters who have continued to kindle war 
and oppose national reconciliation, peace, constitution, and the 
king have made an all-out effort to smash the national forces 
and people in order to enable Vietnam to swallow Cambodia and 
enable their allies to seize and incorporate Cambodia into their 
arena. This is why they have given money to the Vietnamese 
communist puppets and two-headed government for continuing to 
fuel the war. They ordered the attack on Anlung Veng and 
claimed to have won victory and to have seized this area. In 
fact, they suffered heavy and shameful defeats. The journalists 
and national and international public opinion have been informed 
about this big defeat at Anlung Veng -- they met a crushing 
defeat and swore not to fight again for the rest of their lives. 
  While launching this new offensive, they shamelessly claimed 
to have seized Pailin in such a way in an attempt, on the one 
hand, to whitewash their big defeat at Anlung Veng and, on the 
other, to beg for more money and to put pressure on FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia]. They also went so far as to flex 
their muscles for the king when puppets Hun Sen and Chea Sim 
visited Beijing. 
  IV. We would like to stress that on 17 and 18 March, the 
attacking forces of the Vietnamese communist puppets and 
two-headed government were severely smashed by the NADK forces, 
inflicting heavy losses on them in terms of manpower, tanks, and 
artillery. Many of their forces were forced to retreat and flee 
in disarray. On 19 March, puppet Hun Sen and the Political 
Bureau of the Cambodian People's Party of the Vietnamese 
communists ordered their forces to make an adventurous assault. 
On 19 March, the attacking forces then began their onslaught, 
using tanks and artillery as the principle means. They moved up 
to Sala Krau, but were intercepted and attacked from the rear 
and the front by the NADK forces. They were cut to pieces and 
four of their 20 tanks were destroyed. The remaining 16 tanks 
moved up to Sala Krau on the night of 19 March. The people and 
NADK surrounded them from all directions, cutting the attacking 
forces into many parts in the area from Kon Damrei to (Phum Don 
Ta). 
  On the afternoon of 21 March, we destroyed two tanks and 
damaged three others. In addition to the nine tanks we 
destroyed between 8 and 18 March, we destroyed 14 other tanks. 
The remaining tanks are short of fuel and the enemy soldiers 
are suffering shortages of food, ammunition, and spare parts to 
repair the damaged tanks. They are encircled in a four to five 
kilometer area at Sala Krau where the people's forces and the 
NADK are continuing to attack and capture as many of them as 
possible. 
  The attacking forces' supply is inoperable. This is, on the 
one hand, caused by heavy rains as their vehicles get bogged 
down and cannot move forward. On the other hand, they often hit 
land mines and are targets of attack from the people and NADK. 
Many of them are thus destroyed, damaged, and stalled in the 
fields. 
  The doomsday of the Vietnamese communist puppets and the 
two- 
headed government is drawing near. They will soon suffer a 
similar big defeat, just as they did at Anlung Veng because 
their forces -- including tanks, infantrymen, and so forth -- 
that have hazardously moved forward are already being 
intercepted by the people and NADK. 
  [Signed] NADK spokesman 
  [Dated] 22 March 1994

  [Text] Phnom Penh, March 23 (AFP) -- The political editor 
of the bi-weekly MORNING NEWS newspaper, Nguon Non, was arrested 
Wednesday at the paper's offices on defamation charges, family 
and police sources said. 
  Police arrested Nguon Non -- also a member of co-premier 
Prince Norodom Ranariddh's cabinet -- mid-morning at the MORNING 
NEWS offices, his son Norin Lakshmi, the newspaper's publication 
director told AFP. 
  A high-ranking police officer, requesting anonymity, 
confirmed the arrest, which he said was due to a defamation case. 
  "Mr. Nguon Non was summoned twice before a tribunal and he 
did not respond," he said. 
  The government would make no comment on the arrest, except 
to 
say it was studying the incident. 
  The MORNING NEWS was founded at the beginning of the month, 
and has a reported circulation of 30,000. 
  According to Norin Lakhsmi, who called the arrest an "abuse 
of rights," the arrest of his father was linked to recent 
articles denouncing official corruption in Cambodia. 
  Nguon Non's arrest followed the publication last month of 
assurances by King Norodom Sihanouk that press rights in 
Cambodia would be respected.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: "Future Development of the </F>
Situation Will Entirely Depend on the United States"] 
  [Text] The United States again adhered to the policy of 
pressuring and crushing our republic. 
  As already reported, the DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman 
issued a statement manifesting the position of our republic 
regarding the undisguised attempt of the United States to crush 
[apsal] our republic with strong measures [kangkwon] and 
pressure by reversing the agreement of the 25 February DPRK-U.S. 
New York contact. 
  In the statement, the spokesman revealed the good intentions 
[sonui] implemented by our republic and the traitorous act 
[paesin haengwi] taken by the United States in the course of 
carrying out the four-point simultaneous action steps agreed to 
at the 25 February DPRK-U.S. New York contact. The spokesman 
said that the United States showed its intention to resume the 
1994 Team Spirit joint military exercise at last and to impose 
sanctions on us at the UN Security Council on the pretext of the 
issue of inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] and of the exchange of North-South special envoys. 
Concerning this situation, the spokesman clearly stated that we 
cannot unilaterally fulfill obligations put forward in the 
four-point simultaneous action steps, nor can we ensure the 
continuity of safeguards of the IAEA. 
  This is just exercising the sovereignty of our republic. As 
was known, our republic made sincere efforts to fairly resolve 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula after the agreement 
reached at the DPRK-U.S. New York contact last month. 
  We explicitly ensured all conditions so that the inspection 
activities would be carried out to a sufficient extent for the 
continuity of safeguards for seven declared facilities. 
Moreover, we expressed magnanimity toward accepting all demands 
put forward by the inspection team members concerning the issues 
that went far beyond the scope of ensuring the continuity of 
safeguards. 
  We put forward concrete measures and a reasonable method for 
realizing at an early date the exchange of special envoys of the 
North and the South, which the United States raised as a 
precondition. 
  Nevertheless, going counter to this, the United States has 
never carried out the portion that it should have fulfilled 
[chagi halparul chonhyo ihaeing haji anta], and by continually 
presenting unreasonable pretexts, the United States has laid a 
barrier to implementing the four-point simultaneous action steps. 
  Even after suspending the 1994 Team Spirit joint military 
exercise and announcing the date of the third round of DPRK-U.S. 
talks, the United States persistently put forward the 
unreasonable preconditions that only after the IAEA inspection 
is carried out satisfactorily and the exchange of special envoys 
is realized, can these problems be resolved. Now claiming that 
the IAEA inspection is not satisfactory, the United States 
insisted that the inspection must be conducted again. The 
United States also asserted that if the exchange of North-South 
special envoys is not realized, it will not hold a third round 
of DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  What is more grave is that the United States claimed that it 
will refer our so-called nuclear issue to the UN Security 
Council. This is an act that can be carried out only by the 
Americans, who have not freed themselves from the concept of the 
cold war. 
  As for inspection of our nuclear facilities, of which the 
United States is making an issue, the fact that nuclear 
materials in our nuclear facilities were not diverted for other 
purposes could be sufficiently verified by the recent inspection 
activities and the continuity of safeguards could be firmly 
ensured. 
  From the outset, the IAEA Secretariat, violating the 15 
February Vienna agreement by pursuing other purposes, demanded 
the inspection equivalent to regular and nonregular inspections 
based on the nuclear safeguards accord, instead of inspection 
for ensuring the continuity of safeguards. 
  This illustrates that the United States and the IAEA, from 
the beginning, attempted to internationally isolate and crush us 
on the pretext of the nuclear problem. 
  As for the issue of exchanging North-South special envoys, 
the agreement of the 25 February DPRK-U.S. New York contact only 
points out the resumption of working-level contact for the 
exchange of North-South special envoys. However, the United 
States stubbornly put forward the issue of realizing the 
exchange of North-South special envoys. This means violation of 
the agreement of the DPRK- U.S. New York contact. 
  As mentioned earlier, the United States is busily going 
round 
in an attempt to refer our nuclear issue to the UN Security 
Council. Timed to coincide with this, the IAEA held a meeting of 
its Board of Governors and waged a campaign of adopting a 
resolution against us. 
  To cope with such an unreasonable act [pudanghan haengdong] 
by the United States and the IAEA, our republic manifested the 
position of not dispatching its delegation to a third round of 
DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The rupture [kyollyol] of DPRK-U.S. talks is entirely 
attributed to the unjust position and attitude of the United 
States. Therefore, the situation on the Korean peninsula is 
again entering a dangerous phase. 
  The United States showed the move to resume the Team Spirit 
joint military exercise. Foreign reports noted that a U.S. 
naval fleet composed of 30 ships is approaching the water zone 
of the Korean peninsula. The world expressed deep concern over 
such a dangerous act by the United States. 
  As long as the United States is attempting to crush our 
republic by all means using the nuclear issue and DPRK-U.S. 
talks, it is just for our republic to take self-defensive steps. 
As we have repeatedly declared, we are prepared for dialogue 
and for war. 
  The United States should ponder the grave situation 
[omjunghan chongse] prevailing on the Korean peninsula. The 
future development of the situation will totally depend on the 
United States. 
  We will watch the United States act.

  [Text] According to the Voice of America on 22 March, the 
U.S. Department of Defense said that a U.S. Patriot missile 
battalion would move to South Korea from the U.S. state of 
Texas. It was reported that the Patriot missile battalion is 
made up of approximately 40 missile launchers and is composed of 
800 troops. 
  After breaking up the DPRK-U.S. talks, U.S. President 
Clinton 
has ordered the deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea. 
He is also leading the tension on the Korean peninsula to the 
situation of war by babbling that the missiles, which will be 
deployed to South Korea, contribute to the interest of the 
United States and South Korea.

  [Text] According to reports, Japan's NHK Television 
reported on 22 March that U.S. President Clinton had ordered the 
deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea. 
  This is a provocative step to lead the situation to extremes 
by further aggravating tensions on the Korean peninsula. Under 
its intentional scheme to create the situation of confrontation 
with us, the United States has broken up the DPRK-U.S. talks by 
fully overturning the 25 February agreement made at the 
DPRK-U.S. contact in New York and has more openly strengthened a 
military threat and has pressured us by announcing that it will 
resume the Team Spirit 1994 joint military exercise. 
  The order by Clinton to deploy Patriot missiles to South 
Korea is a grave threat to us. This clearly shows that the 
United States is leading the Korean peninsula to the situation 
of war.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton reportedly ordered the deployment of Patriot missiles in 
South Korea, saying the missiles would serve the interests of 
the United States and South Korea. 
  This is a provocative step to drive the situation into 
extremes by screwing up the tensions on the Korean peninsula. 
  Out of an intentional scheme to create an atmosphere of 
confrontation against the DPRK, the United States totally 
reversed the agreed conclusions reached between the DPRK and the 
U.S. at the New York contact on February 25 and broke off the 
DPRK-U.S. talks and now has become all the more undisguised in 
its military threats and pressure against the DPRK, saying the 
"Team Spirit" joint military exercises would be resumed. 
  Clinton's order of the deployment of Patriot missiles in 
South Korea is a grave threat to the DPRK, and it clearly shows 
that the United States is pushing the situation of the Korean 
peninsula to the brink of war.

<F P=106> ["Confrontation Row of Those Digging Their Own Grave" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam of South Korea Monday called a "meeting of 
security-related ministers" at "Chongwadae" [ROK's presidential 
office] to "examine the policy toward the North and the defense 
posture" as regards "the nuclear issue of the North." 
  Shortly before the meeting, U.S. President Bill Clinton sent 
a "personal letter" to Kim Yong-sam the puppet, "reaffirming the 
United States' commitment to defending South Korea" and its 
determination "to strengthen the joint U.S.-South Korean defense 
posture." 
  NODONG SINMUN today brands the puppets' fuss at "Chongwadae" 
as a reckless act to deliberately bring the situation to the 
phase of war after breaking up the working-level contact for the 
exchange of presidential envoys between the North and South. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique declared they would resume the Team 
Spirit joint military maneuvers against the fellow countrymen in 
the North and introduce Patriot missiles in a short time. This 
clearly shows they are a group of despicable traitors who seek a 
way out in harming fellow countrymen in collusion with outside 
forces. 
  As we have declared time and again, we are fully prepared to 
answer dialogue with dialogue and war with war. 
  We are not afraid even if the South Korean puppets resume 
the 
Team Spirit joint military maneuvers and deploy in a short time 
Patriot missiles and anything more sophisticated. 
  We do not like an empty talk. 
  Our people and People's Army will severely punish the 
traitors attempting to stifle fellow countrymen in conspiracy 
with outside forces, and will resolutely defend our socialist 
motherland and the security of the nation. 
  The United States had better know that there is nothing to 
gain and nothing good for it even if it instigates and gives a 
shot in the arm to such a fool as Kim Yong-sam who is 
floundering in the mud as a target of overthrow, forsaken by the 
nation.

Authorities" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 (KNS-KCNA) - The Central Standing 
Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) released a statement Tuesday denouncing the 
U.S. arrogant acts to isolate and stifle the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea at any cost and accusing Japan and the South 
Korean authorities of following it. 
  The United States has all along departed from its agreement 
with the DPRK, reversed even the February 25 agreed conclusions 
on four steps of simultaneous action for a package solution to 
the nuclear issue -- the suspension of the "Team Spirit" joint 
military exercises, the resumption of the working contact for 
the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the 
South of Korea, inspection by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency for the continuity of safeguards and the opening of the 
third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks -- and brought the peaceful 
solution of the nuclear issue to an impasse again, the statement 
said, and went on: 
  The perfidious acts of the U.S. are very dangerous moves 
which may entail confrontation and war again on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  It is not fortuitous that the South Korean authority brought 
to a rupture the working contact for the exchange of 
presidential envoys between the North and the South. This is a 
logical result of his acts seeking confrontation and division, 
not reconciliation and reunification, while consistently 
following the United States, with no will and no capacity to 
resolve the nuclear issue on the peninsula. 
  He, who had blared in chorus with the U.S. that "the 
exchange 
of special envoys is a precondition of the third round of the 
DPRK-U.S. talks," decided on "a tough reaction" and cried for 
the introduction of Patriot missiles and the restarting of the 
"Team Spirit" at "a high-level strategic meeting" held while the 
working contact was under way. 
  Kim Yong-sam is going to visit Japan to discuss 
"international sanctions" against the DPRK. This is nothing but 
an anti-national act to antagonize the fellow countrymen in the 
North with the backing of foreign forces. 
  It must not go unnoticed that the United States has fostered 
pressure on the DPRK, openly revealing its intention to take 
"sanctions" against it through the United Nations Security 
Council, while the Japanese authorities are zealously responding 
to it. 
  Recently, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa charged the DPRK 
with "the breach of the agreement," while closing his eyes to 
the U.S. failure to implement the agreement. This is a 
preposterous misrepresentation of the reality. 
  If the United States, Japan and the South Korean authorities 
continue acting against the demand of the Korean people and the 
world peaceloving people and the trend of the time, they will 
face a stern judgement by history.

  [Text] North Korea has warned that unless the United States 
stops its pressure tactic, it will mean war on the Korean 
peninsula. The warning by North Korea's ambassador to China, Chu 
Chang-chun, is the latest threat in the stand off over North 
Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program. Mr. Chu says the 
deployment of American Patriot missiles in South Korea will only 
accelerate the speed towards war on the Korean peninsula. The 
ambassador also says if international sanctions are imposed on 
North Korea, Pyongyang would, what he called, make the necessary 
response. From Beijing Ali Moore reports. 
  [Moore] North Korea's ambassador Chu Chang-chun says America 
should not forget the Korean war of the 1950's and should use 
the experience as a lesson. As well, he accused the United 
States of organizing international pressure against North Korea 
and said all the moves will only accelerate the speed towards 
war. If there is another war he said the United States and 
South Korea will be fully responsible. North Korea has a large 
diplomatic presence in China, its most important ally and 
trading partner. Chinese leaders say they oppose using pressure 
to resolve the nuclear dispute. Ali Moore, Beijing.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam reportedly told "a meeting of security-related 
officials" on March 21 that "a perfect military security 
posture" should be established. And, on March 22, he issued even 
a belligerent "order" to the puppet Army units to be "on the 
alert". 
  Accordingly, the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff proclaimed "an 
order of special alert" covering the period from March 23 to 30, 
putting the puppet ground, Navy and Air Forces on "a war 
footing". 
  Thus, the South Korean trigger-happy elements are madly 
pushing the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of 
war. 
  As is known to all, the Kim Yong-sam group, after 
unilaterally breaking up the working-level contact for the 
exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the South, 
openly declared that it would resume the "Team Spirit" joint 
military exercises with the United States, its master, and is 
driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme 
pitch of strain by introducing even Patriot missiles into South 
Korea of the United States. 
  The "order" of an "alert posture" which was issued on the 
extension line of such unpardonable dangerous military 
provocations against the North well shows to what extremes the 
traitor Kim Yong-sam has gone in his belligerent attempt to 
overpower the North by force of arms at any cost with the help 
of outside forces. 
  The North is prepared for both dialogue and war. This is its 
unshakable stand and will. 
  If the South Korean puppet clique venture a reckless war 
gamble, remaining deaf to the DPRK's repeated warnings, the 
North would take a decisive self-defensive measure against it.

<F P=106> ["Dangerous Anti-DPRK Smear Campaign of Japanese </F>
Reactionaries" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- The Japanese 
reactionaries are now openly blaring that if the United Nations 
Security Council "decided to take economic sanctions" against 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Japan would "join 
it," according to a report from Tokyo. 
  Against this background, Japanese Government officials 
reportedly began closed-door discussions of "economic sanctions" 
against the DPRK on March 22. 
  The non-existent "nuclear issue" of the DPRK is not a matter 
to be discussed by the United Nations Security Council. The 
attempt to take such "sanctions" through the United Nations 
against the DPRK on the charge of its refusal to accept an 
unwarrantable "nuclear inspection" is unjustifiable and 
unreasonable from the legal point of view and is a gross 
violation of the UN charter. 
  This is nothing but an offspring of such perfidious act of 
the United States as wholly reversing the agreed conclusions 
reached between the DPRK and the United States at the New York 
contact and its trite hostile policy toward Korea. 
  Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries, obtrusively 
enough, 
are showing extra zeal in "economic sanctions" against the DPRK, 
while adding fuel to the U.S. criminal scheme to take this step 
through the United Nations. This is an intolerable, grave 
challenge to the DPRK. 
  It is only too clear that they are seeking to isolate and 
stifle the DPRK at any cost by setting the "international 
cooperation system" in motion and, at the same time, add wings 
to their ambitious scheme to become a nuclear power, charging 
the DPRK with the "nuclear issue." 
  While keeping mum about their criminal design to turn Japan 
into a nuclear power any time, they are trying to take even 
unjustifiable "economic sanctions" against the DPRK, labelling 
this peaceloving nation as a "nuclear offender." This is a 
criminal act which may entail a perilous situation. 
  We have already declared that if seditious forces dare put 
unreasonable pressure upon us in the form of "sanctions," we 
would regard it as something equivalent to "a declaration of 
war." 
  In that case, there will be nothing good for Japan, either. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must properly judge the serious 
developments and promptly stop their reckless scheme of 
"economic sanctions" against the DPRK.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "You Should Not Object to the People's </F>
Will" from the "Program for Officers and Men of the South Korean 
Armed Forces"] 
  [Text] Soldiers of the South Korean Armed Forces: Since a 
long time ago, our people have had an old saying that the 
people's will is the will of heaven, and if one objects to the 
people's will, one will be punished by heaven. 
  The will of heaven and punishment by heaven mean the 
intention of heaven and divine retribution. 
  This proverb contains a historic lesson that the people's 
will is just and if one objects to the people's demand, one 
cannot avoid punishment by heaven. 
  The disgraceful destiny of successive South Korean ruling 
groups clearly illustrates the consequences that were brought to 
one who objected to the will of the popular masses. 
  The successive South Korean ruling groups frantically ran 
amok with maneuvers of a northward war of aggression by carrying 
outside forces on its back and implemented a cruel fascist rule. 
  The act of the South Korean ruling groups went against the 
demand of the people who were aspiring to independence, 
democracy and reunification. The South Korean ruling groups 
reigned over the popular masses and ran wild with oppression. 
What was their destiny? We think that you, the soldiers of the 
South Korean Army, are well aware of it. 
  The successive South Korean ruling groups were overthrown 
because they only committed traitorous acts, going against the 
people's will and the nation's aspirations. 
  The civilian-veiled traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique is 
objecting to the will of the popular masses and the nation's 
demand more viciously than successive South Korean ruling 
bunches. 
  The most urgent demand of our people and nation at present 
is 
achievement of the peaceful reunification of the country. Our 
people, who suffered pains of division for nearly half a 
century, cannot live being separated from each other any longer 
and are looking forward to national reunification even in dreams. 
  To achieve the nation's peaceful reunification -- our 
people's long-cherished desire -- war exercises must be 
suspended on the Korean peninsula. 
  However, the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique is waging 
exercises of a northward war of aggression every day by carrying 
outside forces on its back by challenging the people's desire 
for reunification, and is driving you, the soldiers of the South 
Korean Army, into these exercises. 
  You, the soldiers of the South Korean Army, should not 
traverse the road of objecting the people's will by following 
the order of the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique. 
  History is the course of achieving the demand of the popular 
masses. No strength can block our people's desire for national 
reunification. The traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique, which 
challenged our people's desire for national reunification, will 
be judged by history and will not be able to avoid the collapse. 
  You, the soldiers of the South Korean Army, who are the 
young 
men of Korea, should not spoil your destiny by traversing the 
road of objecting the people's intention on the side of 
traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique. 
  You, the soldiers in the 3d Battalion, 51st Regiment, 12th 
Division of the puppet Army, who are barely keeping up your 
bodies being driven into various exercises and hard work, and 
you, the soldiers in the 1st Battalion, 63d Regiment, 11th 
Division of the puppet Army, who witnessed the death of 
colleagues caused by accidents during training some time ago, 
should deeply examine yourselves who have fallen into disaster 
and misfortune. 
  If you want to get rid of the miserable situation, you 
should 
travel the road of patriotism on which you can share the 
intention of the people. This is the very hope of your parents 
and brothers, and is the nation's demand. 
  You, the soldiers of the South Korean Army, should rise on 
the road of patriotism to share the intention of the people and 
should seek a genuine life.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- Political and public 
circles of different countries strongly demanded the release of 
South Korean long-term prisoners who refused to be converted. 
  Rolf Hagel, chairman of the Workers' Party-Communists of 
Sweden, in a statement March 10 said the South Korean 
authorities keep An Hak-sop, an old man, behind bars for more 
than 40 years on the charge of being a "spy" of North Korea 
merely because he refused to recant his belief in communism. 
They take to prison and put to torture not only communists but 
many figures who call for a peaceful reunification of Korea and 
democratization of society, by invoking the "National Security 
Law", he noted. 
  He demanded that the South Korean authorities abolish the 
"National Security Law" immediately, release unconditionally all 
the unconverted long-term prisoners including An Hak-sop now 
suffering in prison and repatriate Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan. 
  Nzemba Yangana, chief of the Zairean youth group for the 
study of the chuche idea, in a statement March 11 said that the 
struggle of An Hak-sop, who is an old man, for the reunification 
of the country cannot be a "crime" but a proud patriotic deed of 
a righteous son of the nation. 
  He demanded that the South Korean authorities release An 
Hak-sop at once, scrap immediately the "National Security Law", 
an obstacle to reunification, and unconditionally release all 
the unconverted long-term prisoners who have devoted their all 
to the reunification of the country. 
  The Burundi-Korea Friendship Association in a letter to the 
South Korean authority on March 9 strongly urged the 
unconditional and immediate release of An Hak-sop and the prompt 
abolition of the "National Security Law".

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- Shigeru Yoshimatsu, 
representative of Japan's National Council of Societies to save 
Japan-born Korean political prisoners in South Korea, recently 
issued a statement demanding that Kim Yong-sam release all the 
Japan-born Korean political prisoners in South Korea before 
visiting Japan. 
  The statement said that when the Kim Yong-sam "government" 
emerged as a "civilian government" the council expected that all 
of the political prisoners would be released, but none of the 
Japan-born Korean political prisoners has been set free. 
  Although the abolition of the "National Security Law", an 
evil law making people political prisoners, has been demanded 
strongly, it still remains, said the statement. 
  The South Korean authorities must scrap at an early date the 
"National Security Law," a leftover of the cold war era, that 
defines fellow countrymen as the enemy and suppresses the 
pro-reunification movement, urged the statement, expressing 
opposition to Kim Yong-sam's visit to Japan.

<F P=106> ["S. Korean Workers' Struggle for Right to Existence </F>
Supported" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- The spring action of 
workers for a wage hike in South Korea is a just struggle for 
the elementary right to existence, says MINJU CHOSON in a 
commentary today. 
  Noting that workers employed by comprador businesses in 
Seoul, Pusan and other areas are waging a struggle, shouting 
such slogans as "The Authorities' Wage-Curbing Policy Is a 
Policy Killing Workers" and "Increase Wages", the news analyst 
says: 
  Their demand for a higher wage is a demand for a reward for 
their labour and for the right and conditions for a life 
befitting humanity. 
  Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam clique is trying to pacify 
the 
workers in their just struggle to be paid for their labour, 
urging them to "share hardships" and "restrain their demand," 
while insulting their struggle as "collective egoism" and an 
"illegal act" and, furthermore, blackmailing them by invoking 
the fascist "emergency arbitration power", which had not been 
used even in the "Fifth and Sixth Republics", threatening "a 
tough countermeasure". 
  But no suppression can block the workers' struggle. 
  The South Korean workers have no more room to step backward 
from the present life of barest subsistence.

<F P=106> ["Kim Yong-sam Regime's `Reform,' a Solo Play" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- The deceptive nature 
of the "reform" advertised by the traitor Kim Yong-sam is being 
laid bare in South Korea. 
  Tan Pyong-ho, chairman of the National Council of Trade 
Unions, criticized the Kim Yong-sam regime's "reform" as an 
exceptionally anti-popular mode of rule. 
  The Social Justice Study and Practice Society and other 
organisations at a symposium on Kim Yong-sam's "reform" stressed 
that though the "civilian government" hung out the flowery 
signboard of "reform" it has in actuality employed the 
anti-popular ruling method of the military fascist dictatorial 
regimes and has reformed nothing in political, economic, 
educational and all other domains. 
  The HANGYORE SINMUN newspaper charged that though the 
"civilian government" cried for "liquidation of corruption" and 
"change and reform" it keeps Kim Chong-pil, a chief culprit of 
the "May 16 coup d'etat", in power and defends him. The 
newspaper defined the present regime's "reform" as "a solo play 
for a rule minus politics." 
  The opposition Democratic Party opened to the public the ten 
major crimes committed by the Kim Yong-sam puppet government 
over the last year since its emergence, saying that the 
deceptive nature of the "reform" is proved by the soaring prices 
caused by the anti-popular policy, treacherous opening of the 
agro-market, suspension of North-South dialogue resulting from 
the anti-reunification policy, serious pollution of the 
environment and never-ceasing disasters.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- The worker-peasant 
department of the Central Committee of the South Korean National 
Democratic Front (Hanminjon) issued a message of indignation 
March 17 denouncing the traitor Kim Yong-sam's criminal opening 
of the rice market, the Seoul-based Radio Voice of National 
Salvation reported. 
  The message said: 
  The nightmarish opening of the rice market in South Korea is 
a never-to-be-condoned crime which results from the flunkeyist 
treachery of Kim Yong-sam who flatteringly yielded to the 
brigandish pressure from U.S. imperialism. It is intolerable 
that he claims "there will be more things gained than lost" in 
rice market opening. 
  Due to the Kim Yong-sam traitorous group, the six million 
farmers of South Korea are deprived of fields and means of 
livelihood. 
  The only way for us to get rid of the miserable lot today is 
to cut the colonial noose of the United States through the 
anti-U.S. struggle for independence and decisively overthrow Kim 
Yong-sam, a pro-U.S. flunkeyist and rare traitor. 
  The message called on the South Korean farmers to rise up in 
struggle and resolutely check the rice market opening ruinous to 
the nation, overthrow the Kim Yong-sam "government" and drive 
out the United States.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- A contact between Yu 
Mi-yong, chairperson of the Central Guidance Committee of the 
Korean Chondoist Association, and An Ho-sang, leader of the 
Tangun Taejonggyo in South Korea, was held in Beijing on March 
12 and 14. 
  At the contact, they openheartedly discussed matters of 
common concern, including the tasks facing the Chondoists and 
Tangun Taejonggyo believers in the North and South of Korea in 
achieving the independent and peaceful reunification of the 
country through the great unity of the whole nation. 
  An agreement was adopted at the contact, which says: 
  "Considering that the great unity of the whole nation fully 
accords with the Chondoist idea of concord and the Tangun 
Taejonggyo's spirit of promoting human interests, the Chondoists 
and Tangun Taejonggyo believers in the North and South will make 
joint efforts to achieve great national unity on the principle 
of subordinating everything to national reunification, the 
common cherished desire of the nation, as Paedal (Korean) 
nationals, transcending the differences in ideology and social 
system, and to achieve the country's reunification, the supreme 
task of the nation, on the three principles of independence, 
peaceful reunification and great national unity. 
  "The Chondoists and Tangun Taejonggyo believers in the North 
and South will make joint efforts to accomplish the cause of 
national reunification in the 1990s without fail through mutual 
contact and dialogue. 
  "The recent disinterment and scientific study of the Tomb of 
Tangun in Pyongyang was a historic event which confirmed that 
the Korean nation is a homogeneous nation that has developed a 
long history of five thousand years and brilliant culture, with 
Tangun, a real person, as its father. 
  "The chairperson of the Central Guidance Committee of the 
Korean Chondoist Association invited delegates of Tangun 
Taejonggyo in South Korea to visit Pyongyang and participate in 
the ceremony for the completion of the Tomb of Tangun after its 
reconstruction, and the leader of Tangun Taejonggyo invited 
delegates of Chondoists in the Northern half to visit Seoul. On 
that basis, the sides confirmed each other's willingness to 
dispatch their delegates to Pyongyang and Seoul in the 
convenient time. 
  "The Central Guidance Committee of the Korean Chondoist 
Association will deeply study the proposals of the South Korean 
religious leader -- the North and the South should jointly 
observe the national foundation day and other traditional 
functions as proposed by the religious leader of South Korea, 
define and restore holy places of Tangun in North and South and 
hold an academic seminar of scholars in North, South and 
overseas on Tangun in an appropriate time and the Northern 
headquarters of Tangun Taejonggyo be set up -- and then inform 
the competent organ of the result. 
  "The sides promised to make active efforts to carry the 
agreed points into practice."

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 14 March "special article": "Our Party Is an </F>
Impregnable Fortress"] 
  [Text] Today our party is vigorously continuing to traverse 
the road of glorious struggle holding aloft the banner of 
socialism. Our party is leading the socialist cause down an 
ever-victorious road without the slightest degree of faltering 
despite all kinds of difficulties and barriers. In the course 
of this struggle our party is demonstrating its pride as a party 
of impregnable fortress. The party of impregnable fortress! 
This is the symbol of our party's greatness and invincibility. 
Our party is a mighty party, the ideology of which is great and 
the faith and will of which are incomparably strong and which is 
single-heartedly united. There is no such great party in the 
world. 
  Today our people are filled with the great dignity and honor 
of having the party of impregnable fortress led by the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. They are burning with the firm 
faith and determination to fight more staunchly along the banner 
of the party. 
<H5>  1. Our Party Is a Party With Great Ideology </H5>
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: The 
chuche, which is our party's world view, is a guiding ideology 
of our times that elucidates the most correct way for the 
realization of the independence of the popular masses. 
  The working class party is the general staff of the 
revolution and the guiding organization of socialist, communist 
construction. For the party to become the strong and mighty 
party that leads the socialist cause to victory, its ideology 
should be great. The party's guiding ideology is the fundamental 
idea [kibon inyom] that elucidates the purpose of the party's 
struggle and the principles and methods for its realization. The 
guiding ideology determines the party's character and regulates 
the basic direction of party building and party activities. 
  The party of the working class cannot only implant faith in 
the correctness and victory of its cause among party members and 
the people, but also achieve its ideological and volitional 
unity and cohesion and lead to victory the revolution and 
construction with correct strategies and tactics only when it 
has the great guiding ideology. For the party of the working 
class to have a correct guiding ideology is a serious problem 
that is closely related to the destiny of the party, that is, 
the destiny of socialism. The socialist ruling party collapsed 
in some countries in recent years. This was because they did not 
have a correct guiding ideology. 
  When one fails to carry out activities independently with 
one's own guiding ideology and fails to develop creatively one's 
own guiding ideology in conformity with the aspirations of the 
times and people, one will inevitably encounter bitter failure 
and vicissitudes in party building, which will eventually result 
in creating a grave consequence of making a mess of the party 
itself. 
  Historic lessons have shown that when the party of the 
working class lacks a great ideology it is destined to become an 
enervated party like a club and cannot defend socialism from the 
maneuvers by the imperialists and the betrayers of the 
revolution. 
  Today our party has become a party of impregnable fortress 
because it has the great revolutionary ideology. Our party's 
only guiding ideology is the immortal chuche idea, that is, the 
ideology that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has developed 
and completed. 
  The correctness and vitality of the revolutionary ideology 
lie in how correctly the ideology reflects the independent 
demands and interests of the popular masses and how 
scientifically it has elucidated the way for their realization. 
  The dear comrade leader has developed and completed the 
chuche idea based on his scientific, deep insight into the 
demands of our times and the aspirations of the people. Our 
party's ideology and theory are the ever-victorious banner that 
leads the struggle for the popular masses' independence to 
victory and are also the revolutionary strategies and tactics 
that make it possible to defeat imperialism and to consummate 
the socialist cause, the cause of mankind's independence. 
  Our party has become the great and invincible revolutionary 
party that has not been shaken under any difficult circumstances 
because it has the great ideology and theory that are grouped 
with the respected name of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  The might of our party that has the great ideology is 
boundless. That our party has been able to pioneer a most 
correct road in building the revolutionary party of the era of 
independence and to defend the banner of the revolution without 
the slightest trepidation, even when others were encountering 
difficulties and vicissitudes, is precisely because it carries 
out party building and party activities, taking the great 
ideology and theory as its guiding principle. 
  When we carry out party building and activities with the 
great ideology, we can be constantly strengthened and develop 
the party into an invincible, revolutionary party and can 
brilliantly implement the socialist cause. This is a valuable 
truth proven by our revolutionary practices. 
  Our party is, above all, thoroughly adhering to its 
revolutionary character as a chuche-type party because it has 
the great ideology. How the party adheres to its revolutionary 
character is an important question that is related to its 
prospects. 
  Missions, strategies, tactics, and the fighting way of the 
party can change in the course of progress of the revolution, 
but its revolutionary character cannot change. Changes in the 
party's character cause a loss of the party's face [tangui 
myonmoui sangsil] and result in a tragedy of its degeneration 
into a strange party. 
  The strength of the party is demonstrated in the way of 
thoroughly adhering to its revolutionary character. The party's 
guiding ideology is essential in adhering to its revolutionary 
character. If its guiding ideology is great, the party will not 
flutter no matter how the imperialists and reactionaries 
maneuver to degenerate the party and can be constantly 
consolidated and developed along its own way. Today, our party 
can thoroughly adhere to its chuche-oriented character under any 
circumstances just because of its great ideology. 
  No matter how environments and conditions for the revolution 
change, the party's revolutionary character created by the 
leader [suryong] should thoroughly be adhered to. This is a 
firm position that the dear comrade leader sticks to in the 
party building. Based on this position, the dear comrade leader 
presented the party building program on modelling the entire 
party after the chuche idea and has wisely led the struggle to 
realize it. 
  In those days, the dear comrade leader generally systemized 
and completed the ideology and theory on the chuche-oriented 
party building and accumulated immortal achievements and 
valuable experience in party building. His achievements 
comprehend all theoretical and practical problems in building 
the revolutionary party -- including the question on party 
building and its activities with the chuche idea as a guiding 
principle, the policies of building the party as a party for the 
working popular masses, of firmly guaranteeing the unitary 
ideology and leadership in the party, of considering the party's 
unity a primary task in party building, and of preparing the 
party based on the ideology, as well as the question on imbuing 
the society with a single ideology and firmly realizing the 
political leadership for the entire society. 
  Thanks to the ideology for chuche-oriented party building 
elucidated by the dear comrade leader, our party is proceeding 
with the party building and its activities without the slightest 
deviation or vicissitude and is firmly adhering to its 
revolutionary character. 
  Our party is arming party cadres and members with the chuche 
idea and preparing them to become chuche-type communist 
revolutionaries who actively struggle to realize the chuche 
idea. At the same time, our party is firmly adhering to the 
purity of the chuche idea and is uncompromisingly fighting 
against all old ideologies that contradict it, such as bourgeois 
and revisionist ideologies, so that it can prevent any strange 
ideology from penetrating our party. 
  Because it has the great ideology, our party has hardened 
its 
organizational and ideological basis and has consolidated and 
strengthened the single-hearted unity of the entire party. 
  No matter how far the revolution advances, and no matter how 
vicious the imperialists and reactionaries maneuver, our party 
will continue its blood line unblemished and will shine forever 
as a chuche-type revolutionary party. 
  With the great ideology as a guiding principle, our party is 
also brilliantly developing the future of socialism, overcoming 
any trial and obstacle. The road toward socialism is an 
untrodden road to be developed totally anew as well as a road of 
severe struggle, along which we should advance in an acute 
confrontation with the imperialists. Therefore, it is matter of 
course that there are obstacles and trials in the course of 
advance toward socialism and that unexpected incidents may occur. 
  In order to stoutly push ahead with the struggle to complete 
socialism without the slightest vicissitude, the party must have 
scientific ideology and correct strategies and tactics. The 
party with the great ideology never pulls down the socialist 
banner until it accomplishes its historic mission and advances 
even more stoutly, filled with faith and optimism. 
  Our party has the great socialist, communist building 
ideology and theory that enable it to victoriously lead the 
revolution and construction according to the demand of reality. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il presaged the 
inevitability [happopchiksong] of socialist construction and the 
people's desire with his extraordinary wisdom and scientific 
insight a long time ago, and has brilliantly completed the 
ideology and theory for chuche-oriented socialist, communist 
construction. 
  Our party's ideology and theory are a great communist theory 
on occupying the ideological and material fortresses of 
socialism by remolding the nature, the society, and human beings 
in accordance with the chuche demand, under the banner of 
modelling the entire society after the chuche idea. It is also 
an encyclopedic theory, with which we can brilliantly solve all 
problems arising in the course of the revolution and 
construction. Because it is leading the revolution and 
construction with this great ideology and theory as its guiding 
principle, our party is brilliantly developing the future of 
socialism without the slightest deviation or vicissitude. 
  Without fluttering even when others were loudly talking that 
they would reform and reorganize socialism [namduri sahoejuuirul 
kaehyokhago kaepyonhandago ttodurodael ttaeedo], our party has 
been able to further strengthen its leadership and advance 
toward socialism with confidence, adhering to the Taean work 
system and the rural theses, just because it considers the great 
ideology and theory its guiding principle. This is the basic 
factor that has enabled our party to protect and defend 
socialism of our own style and to accelerate the revolution and 
construction. 
  The wise leadership of our party, which is pioneering the 
course of socialism with the great ideology, was clearly 
demonstrated when the grave incident of frustration of socialism 
occurred in some countries. When imperialists and reactionaries 
talked as if socialism had come to an end and when people who 
desire socialism lost their faith, our party scientifically 
elucidated the way to correctly explain the substance of the 
incident and to rebuild the socialist movement. This is a great 
historic contribution that can be made only by a party with its 
own great guiding ideology. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's works -- such as 
"Historic Lessons of Socialist Construction and Our Party's 
General Line," "On Fundamental Questions on Revolutionary Party 
Building," and "Disturbance of Socialism Cannot Be Allowed" -- 
vigorously demonstrate the greatness and justness of our party's 
ideology and theory that advance the socialist cause 
victoriously. 
  Not only our people but also the revolutionary people of the 
world firmly believe that, when they adhere to the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il's ideology and theory, they can sternly 
smash all antisocialist maneuvers by imperialists and 
reactionaries and can achieve the ultimate victory of the 
socialist cause. 
  Since it has the great ideology, our party is displaying its 
high esteem and honor as a great guide [hyangdoja] that pioneers 
the socialist cause at the forefront through severe trials in 
history. 
<H3>  2. Our Party Is a Party With Peerlessly Strong Faith and 
Will </H3>
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il noted: Our party has 
never given in its faith and will under any offensive by the 
enemy. It has advanced through severe trials with such faith 
and will. 
  The party cause is a difficult and complicated struggle 
through manifold trials and hardships. In order for the party 
to fulfill its sublime mission, it must have not only the great 
ideology but also faith and will with which to realize it to the 
end. The invincible faith that would rather break than bend! 
The invincible will with which the party never recedes from the 
road of revolution even if the world overturns tens of hundreds 
of times! The principle that the party never pulls down the 
revolutionary banner until it achieves the ultimate victory of 
the revolution! These are uncommon traits of the party that are 
carrying out the revolution. When the entire party is filled 
with such invincible faith and will, the party can demonstrate 
itself as an impregnable party. 
  A party with firm faith and will that is unswayable in any 
trend of the time will never be destroyed or degenerated by any 
offensive by the enemy. Just like the people's revolutionary 
spirit is determined by the depth of their faith, the party's 
might and solidity are guaranteed by the resoluteness of its 
revolutionary faith. Faith and determination that the party 
keeps in leading the revolution are decisive factors that 
influence the destinies of the country and the nation. 
  The long history of the communist movement has many actual 
examples showing that the revolution was frustrated and people 
fell into misery because of unstable determination. The faith 
of the working class party and its leader [yongdoja], which are 
responsible for the destinies of the country and the nation, did 
not become unstable. 
  Inconsistent faith and weak will can never be allowed on the 
arduous road of struggle, on which even a single misstep may 
cause one to fall into subordination, servitude, frustration, 
and failure. The party's faith is the destiny and future of the 
revolution. Only a party with stout faith and will can overcome 
severe difficulties in the revolution and can lead the people to 
the heroic struggle and feats. Because it has iron-firm faith 
and will, our party wins honor as an impregnable party and as an 
ever-victorious party that never loses. 
  All our party's activities and struggle are run through with 
the firm determination to advance along the single chuche road 
pioneered by the great leader [suryong] and with the perfect 
faith and will to lead the people to consummate the socialist 
cause. 
  This determination and will have their roots in the Paektu 
revolutionary spirit created in an early stage of pioneering the 
revolution, and they have been firmly hardened through the 
severe class struggle and the huge struggle for creation and 
construction. 
  Therefore, our party's faith and will are not shaken even in 
the fierce political, military, and ideological confrontation 
with the enemy, and have become stouter as generations are 
shifted and as the revolution advances further. Herein is the 
reason the people of the world call the Worker's Party of Korea 
[WPK] an iron party. 
  As it has invincible faith and will, our party has become 
the 
great party that changes an adverse situation into a favorable 
one by bravely smashing any antisocialist maneuver by the 
imperialists. 
  The confrontation with the enemy is the confrontation of 
strength and of faith and will. Only with faith and courage to 
free oneself from being afraid of any threat, blackmail, and 
powerful enemy, one can win a victory without fail. This is why 
we call the victory of the revolution the victory of faith and 
will. 
  Today, imperialists are taking an unprecedented offensive in 
all areas -- political, military, and economic -- to isolate and 
ruin [malsal] our Republic, the fortress of socialism. Today, 
when socialism has been frustrated in some countries, the world 
reactionaries' antisocialist maneuvers aim at us. 
  Although our party is leading the revolution in this acute 
political and military confrontation, it has never fumbled or 
fluttered under the enemy's antirevolutionary offensive. The 
more the imperialists highhandedly put pressure on it, our party 
copes with it with the spirit of untiring patience and smashes 
an antirevolutionary offensive with a revolutionary offensive. 
This is the stout trait of the WPK under the leadership of 
General Kim Chong-il, an iron-willed, sagacious general. 
  Any threat with nuclear weapons or slandering agitation can 
never work with our party and people. It is no accident that 
the conscientious people of the world, who can look straight at 
the reality, warn imperialists to be well aware what rival 
[sangdae] they are facing. 
  Since it has invincible, firm faith, and will, our party is 
always strong and stern in the confrontation with the 
imperialists. When the enemy created a dangerous situation on 
the brink of war, our party responded to it with the great 
decision by announcing the semi-war state in the entire country, 
all the people, and the entire Army. When the enemy maneuvered 
to demolish [wahae] us with crafty pacification strategy, our 
party smashed it with bold and clever tactics, taking the 
initiative. 
  Today, our people are accelerating the socialist 
construction 
with the fighting spirit to annihilate the aggressors, who try 
to harm our socialism, while singing the song of faith that one 
can win victory when one keeps socialism, and one will die when 
one abandons it. This is because they have the same invincible 
faith and offensive spirit [konggyok chongsin] as that of our 
party. 
  As long as our people's struggle is under the leadership of 
our party, which has the stoutest faith and will, its history 
will shine as an ever-victorious history of struggle of changing 
an adverse situation into a favorable one and of turning 
misfortune into a blessing. 
  Because of its firm revolutionary faith and will, our party 
is demonstrating its mighty appearance as a most revolutionary 
party that never retreats even a step from the principle of the 
revolution. The process in which socialism is victorious is the 
process in which the principle of the revolution is defended and 
embodied. In the revolutionary struggle, the principle of the 
revolution is always precious as life--yesterday, today, and in 
the future, too. In the struggle to determine socialism or 
capitalism standing back from the principle of the revolution 
itself is synonymous with surrender. 
  How to deal with the principle of the revolution and how to 
defend it is precisely an important touchstone which shows the 
firmness of the faith of the working class party and its combat 
capability and might. The character of our party's resolute 
revolutionary principle has already been known to the world. 
Even in the early period when modern revisionism emerged, our 
party repelled any pressure from big countries and firmly 
defended its chuche-oriented revolutionary line. Even in the 
period when the trend of modern socialist democracy emerged, our 
party never stood back from the principle of the revolution. 
  The principle is victorious without fail, and even though 
the 
circumstances and conditions of the revolutionary struggle may 
vary, the basic ideal and demands of socialism can never change. 
This is precisely the revolutionary position to which our party 
has firmly adhered. 
  It is easy to speak about faithfulness to the principle of 
the revolution, but it is not easy to put it into practice. This 
is more true today, at a time when the wind of antisocialism is 
sweeping. However, our party has firmly and invariably adhered 
to the basic principles of socialism, including the principle of 
realizing the party's unitary leadership in the revolution and 
construction, cherishing firm will. To be faithful to the 
principles of socialism, it is imperative to have firm faith, 
and to render this firm faith absolutely and invariably. This is 
precisely the noble truth that has been proven by the struggle 
history of our party. 
  Because of its firm faith and will our party has also become 
an invincible revolutionary party that is capable of fulfilling 
without fail any vast tasks arising in socialist construction. 
  The might of the working class party lies in the power of 
the 
practice of changing the socialist ideal into a great reality. 
The party that fails to carry out the struggle task once it has 
promised the people, cannot enjoy support from the people or 
maintain dignity. 
  The history of our party's struggle is a history of 
stubbornness and a history of heroic exploits, as -- upon 
setting a bold attacking target -- it has occupied that target 
and has been constantly occupying a new attacking position in 
succession. The power of will that our party displayed on these 
days was beyond our imagination. Once our party decides to carry 
out a task, it fulfills it without fail. This is our party's 
disposition. Once our party has started to carry out a task it 
pushes ahead with it until it is finished. This is our party's 
(?habit). 
  Smashing the maneuvers of the enemies of the revolution with 
rock-firm will if they provoke and breaking through the 
mountains with indomitable spirit of attack if they block is 
precisely the inherent struggle spirit of our party. The huge 
locomotive of the Korean revolution that is dashing toward the 
terminal of communism has been running to today's plane on the 
strength of this faith and will of our party. 
  Our party is faced with the heavy but honorable task to 
cultivate political and economic strength capable of living 
independently under any difficult circumstances and to fully 
enhance the superiority of socialism of our own style. Each of 
the struggle tasks that our party carried out in the past were 
not easy. However, today's revolutionary tasks of our party are 
more vast and difficult. Despite such a situation, our party's 
determination and will to turn our Republic into a firm fortress 
of socialism by thoroughly embodying the revolutionary economic 
strategy and by firmly deepening the country's national defense 
capability are firm and invariable. 
  Our party's matchless courage and its strong power of 
decision and rock-firm will have constantly bestowed faith and 
courage in the victory of the revolution upon our people. 
Whenever our party made a courageous decision and a strong 
measure that shook the social circles of the world our people's 
hearts were seething with the dignity and pride that our party 
is the first and our Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il is 
the first. 
  In the dark period of national suffering our people waged an 
indomitable struggle, looking ahead to the future of national 
liberation. Likewise, our people are struggling with firm faith, 
looking ahead to the bright future of socialism of our own style 
from the might of the Workers' Party of Korea. This is today's 
proud appearance of our people. For our people who have the 
party of impregnable fortress there is nothing to fear and there 
is no task that cannot be carried out. 
  With the resolute faith and will embraced by the party, our 
people will all the more vigorously accelerate the general march 
of socialism of our own style, and will wholly demonstrate the 
indomitable spirit of the heroic people who do not know defeat 
or retreat in that road. 
<H5>  3. Our Party Is a Party of Single-Hearted Unity </H5>
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: We can 
say today with confidence that our party achieved cohesion and 
unity that is most solid and has the greatest vitality in which 
it cannot be frustrated in whatever way and which can overcome 
any kind of trial. 
  Unity is the party's might and the source of invincibility. 
The party itself cannot exist and strengthen apart from the 
revolutionary unity. Therefore, we are saying that one of the 
most important signs of the revolutionary party--the party of 
impregnable fortress--that does not waver in any kind of 
hardship of history, lies in the revolutionary unity. 
  When looking back at history, there were no parties that did 
not uphold the banner of unity among the working class parties 
that exist up till the present. Then what is the reason for the 
collapse of parties that have magnificent tradition and a long 
history? This is because the parties did not carry out the 
struggle to achieve a true revolutionary unity. 
  The most solid and mighty unity among unity is the 
single-hearted unity. The single-hearted unity is consisted of 
only one ideology and one center. It is also based on one 
bloodline being succeeded generation after generation. 
  If we achieve single-hearted unity, then we can smash 
[chitbusida] any powerful enemy and acquire the universe. In 
the historical communist movement, the WPK was the first party 
to achieve this great single-hearted unity. Therefore, it is 
becoming a party of impregnable fortress in which the whole 
world is admiring. 
  Our party's single-hearted unity has currently risen to the 
most lofty height under the leadership of the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il. In our party, we have already completed 
the historical cause that builds the party's organizational and 
ideological basis. 
  Therefore, our party is becoming an iron-willed rank in 
which 
the whole party is firmly uniting around the great leader 
[yongdoja], who is succeeding the revolutionary cause, through 
ideological will, morality, and sense of duty. Also, our party 
is becoming an invincible party in which whatever element cannot 
weaken the party's political and ideological integrity and unity. 
  The might of our party's single-hearted unity is most of all 
being manifested by the fact that the whole party is overflowing 
with the absolute admiration of endlessly cherishing and 
following its leader [yongdoja]. In essence, the work to 
realize the party's cohesion and unity is the work to strengthen 
the blood-tied relationship between the leader [yongdoja] 
leading the party and the party members who comprehend the party. 
  Only when the leader [yongdoja] is great and when all the 
party members united around the leader [yongdoja] have a 
thorough faith and sense of duty, can this kind of unity become 
an invincible cohesion and unity that overcomes any kind of 
trials and difficulties. 
  Unity based on practical unity and obligation cannot last 
long and cannot manifest the invincible might. In our party, we 
are highly upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the 
center of unity and center of leadership. Therefore, the 
blood-tied relationship, which cannot be severed even if we 
wanted to, between the leader [yongdoja] and fighters was firmly 
formed. 
  This resolute relationship is based on absolute admiration 
of 
their leader [yongdoja], which is deeply rooted in the hearts of 
our party members through the long experiences of practical 
life. Thus, this has eternal vitality. 
  Our party members are singing the song by Comrade Yi In-mo, 
"We win if you are with us," and are carrying on their party 
life bearing his dedicated poem deep in their hearts, for in 
this poem and song is reflected the firm, invariable outlook on 
the leader of the revolutionary fighter. The absolute mind of 
reverence the WPK members have--this is the fascination toward 
the dear comrade leader, the great iron-willed man and the 
incarnation of the great faith and will; the invariable 
conviction that our fatherland and socialism exist because he is 
with us; and the noble revolutionary conscience with which they 
are firmly determined to adhere to the revolutionary fidelity to 
the leader [yongdoja] who has brought them up. Because they 
have this ideology and spirit, our party members are waging a 
vigorous struggle with a resolve to become a gun and a bomb to 
protect and defend the party as they did during the last 
semi-war state period. Whenever they are assigned a difficult 
revolutionary task, they highly display unmatched devotion as a 
standard-bearer of the ranks. 
  Flawlessly pure and warm is our party members' mind to 
entrust the great leader [widaehan yongdoja] with all their 
destiny and follow him to the end of the world. Seeing the 
noble traits of our party members who adore the dear comrade 
leader day and night and send him many a letter of faith and 
loyalty, the people of the world cannot help admiring our 
party's might in which the leader and the fighter are 
wholeheartedly united. Because the millions of party members 
with indomitable conviction are upholding the great leader 
[widaehan yongdoja], our party's unity and cohesion cannot be 
destroyed by anything, and the WPK displays its might to the 
entire world. 
  Our party's might of wholehearted unity is also demonstrated 
in the strong organization and discipline with which the entire 
party membership functions consistently according to the 
leader's ideology and volition. The revolutionary organization 
and discipline are the lifeline of the party, and it is an 
important yardstick showing its might of wholehearted unity. 
Only such a party that has succeeded in realizing wholehearted 
unity can function consistently according to the leader's 
ideology and volition, and can organize and mobilize the entire 
party membership vigorously toward the realization of a single 
objective. The party's might is the might of organization and 
discipline. 
  Our party has realized wholehearted unity without its 
parallel in history and has become a militant party with strong 
organization and discipline. In our party, a revolutionary 
leadership system has been firmly established, and all the party 
work and party activities are conducted thoroughly according to 
the dear comrade leader's ideology and volition. All the party 
organizations and party members always develop all work 
according to the party policy and implement the party's 
decisions and directives through fire and water to the end. 
This is the proud feature of our party. 
  In our party, the resolve of the leader [yongdoja] is the 
resolve of the party members. All the party members talk the 
same thing and walk at the same pace. Apart from this might of 
our party, which has firmly established firm order and 
discipline, we cannot mention the proud reality of our 
revolution in which the unitary nature of ideology and 
leadership is firmly ensured, nor can we think of the might of 
our country with which all the country, all the people, and the 
entire Army function consistently. Because of its strong 
organization and discipline which nothing can destroy, our party 
becomes a great party which invariably deals the revolution's 
enemy a powerful blow and which gives the people confidence and 
optimism. 
  Our party is neither a feeble party that is utterly 
disunited 
faced with the trial of the revolution, nor a dispirited party 
that is crumbled in the revisionist inclination advocating 
liberalization and democracy. Our party's organization and 
discipline are unshakable today, and they will remain as strong 
as iron in the future as well. No counterrevolutionary 
maneuvers of the enemy of the revolution will be able to destroy 
our party's strong organization and discipline. 
  Our party's might, which is solidified like an impregnable 
fortress, consists in its taking root deep in the broad popular 
masses and commanding their absolute support. The popular 
masses are the foundation and root based on the working class 
party. The party which has departed from the popular masses, 
the party which cannot command the support of the masses is like 
a house of cards. As the strength of the popular masses is 
inexhaustible, so the party which is in firm unity with the 
people is ever-victorious. 
  Today, our party has not only achieved single-hearted unity 
in the party ranks, but struck its roots deep among the broad 
strata of the popular masses and won absolute support from them. 
  Our people have boundless pride in their party and cherish 
deep in their hearts the notion that they cannot live even for a 
moment without the party. 
  The belief of our heroic working class is that our party is 
the best because it has built a working class-oriented society, 
and the will of our farmers is that they would defend and 
maintain the socialist rural economic system to the end under 
the party's leadership. Our intellectuals have a great honor to 
be the party's eternal companions, sincere supporters, and 
excellent advisers, and the young people of the new generation 
are filled with the pride of being the young vanguards of the 
WPK. This is a testament to the fact that the WPK is an 
invincible party that has blood ties with people from all walks 
of life and leads the revolution with their absolute support and 
trust. 
  In particular, our party and the People's Army are one in 
flesh and spirit. This is great pride incomparable to anything 
else. A revolutionary army is the defender of the party's 
cause, the socialist cause. A party that wins no support or 
trust from a revolutionary army and fails to take deep roots in 
the army cannot defend socialism against the imperialists' 
aggression maneuvers or lead the revolution to victory. 
  The military discipline of the People's Army, which is 
boundlessly loyal to the party and the leader [suryong] and 
moves like one under the party's leadership, is very excellent. 
Our People's Army officers and men are filled with a firm 
resolve to entrust their entire destinies to General Kim 
Chong-il, our supreme commander, and be the first to resolutely 
defend the party and the leader [suryong] by becoming guns and 
bombs. 
  Our party is powerful, and the security of our fatherland is 
firmly guaranteed because there is the People's Army, which has 
grown into an invincible powerful Army under the comrade supreme 
commander's leadership. 
  The invincible might of our party, which has struck its 
roots 
deep among the workers, farmers, soldiers, intellectuals, and 
popular masses from all other walks of life, is fully 
demonstrated in revolution and construction. We crush any 
challenge by the imperialists, resolutely defend and maintain 
socialism of our own style, and score great upsurges in 
revolution and construction because we have this might of 
single-hearted unity. 
  The invincibility of socialism of our own style and its 
bright prospects lie in blood unity among the party, people, and 
Army that are strongly united around the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. 
  Truly, our party is a party that achieved the most solid and 
vital unity and cohesion never before seen in history and an 
invincible party that has blood ties with the popular masses. 
No power in the world can match this steel-like party. 
  Having an impregnable party is our people's greatest 
happiness and honor. Because there is our party led by General 
Kim Chong-il, our supreme commander, our country takes pride in 
being a powerful socialist country no one dares to provoke; our 
people take pride in being heroic people with combatant 
disposition who are always in the habit of winning; and our 
People's Army takes pride in being an invincible revolutionary 
Army that makes it its conviction to win every war. 
  Because the party is mighty, socialism of our own style wins 
victory after victory without shaking. Our party today takes 
pride in being an impregnable party, entirely because it upholds 
the iron-willed general and great leader of the revolution 
[kangchorui yongjang hyongmyongui widaehan yongdoja]. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great leader 
[widaehan yongdoja] who strengthens and develops our party into 
an invincible revolutionary party under the banner of modeling 
the entire party after the chuche idea. Our party's great ideas 
are Comrade Kim Chong-il's ideas and theories, our party's 
belief and will is General Kim Chong-il's incomparable boldness 
and will, and our party's single-hearted unity is single-hearted 
unity around Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  That our party casts its ray as an impregnable party because 
it upholds the great leader [yongdoja] is our party's proud 
reality today. Our party's might is boundless, and the party's 
prospects are boundlessly bright. Under this invincible party's 
leadership, we will win a victory in the cause of socialism of 
our own style and accomplish the historic cause of the 
fatherland's reunification after overcoming any wind or storm, 
defeat the imperialists, and hasten the cause of achieving 
independence throughout the world. 
  The revolutionary banner which our impregnable party hoists 
aloft will eternally fly with the strong belief that "Let the 
cowardice go his way, and but we will defend the red flag!" 
  The revolutionary cause of our people who, filled with 
confidence and optimism, are fighting under the banner of the 
great party, is ever-victorious!

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- The coal industry is 
developing in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  The coal production grew 1.4 times during the period of the 
third seven-year plan (1987-1993). 
  The state has systematically increased investment in the 
coal 
industrial sector, attaching primary importance to its 
development. Big coal mines have been rebuilt on an expansion 
basis in Anju, Sunchon, northern and other coal-rich districts 
and many new promising ones built. 
  Scores of coal mines including the large-scale Soho and 
December 16 coal mines went into operation over the past 10 
years. The Yipsok, Yongrim, Taehyang and other coal mines were 
built at the Anju district coal mining complex whose annual coal 
production capacity has now reached 15 million tons. 
  Projects for replacing mining equipment with large-sized, 
modern and high-speed ones have been completed at coal mines to 
increase the coal production capacity. 
  Coal production was 1.5 million tons in 1946, the year 
following the liberation of the country, and it increased to 
27.5 million tons in 1970 and 85 million tons at the end of the 
1980s. 
  The coal industrial domain now is concentrating big efforts 
on arranging new coal fields by giving precedence to prospecting 
while increasing the ongoing production. According to survey 
data, the nation's coal deposits amount to tens of billions of 
tons. Several billion tons of coal deposits have been 
discovered in Saeppyol county of North Hamgyong Province, Paekam 
county of Yanggang Province and other places in recent years.

  [Text] The planned construction of the Gunung Muria 
Nuclear Power Plant in Central Java will continue despite strong 
public reaction, particularly those from environmentalists. 
Jali Ahimsa, director general of the National Atomic Energy 
Agency [BATAN], said this to reporters after opening a meeting 
of a working group of Asia-Pacific atomic experts in Kuta, Bali. 
According to the BATAN director general, a lack of funds is the 
main obstacle in the construction of the Gunung Muria Nuclear 
Power Plant. However, he attached great importance to the use 
of nuclear power because Indonesia will need huge electricity 
supplies, particularly in Java and Bali, in the future.

<F P=106> [By Paul Jacob Jakarta] </F>
  [Text] Jakarta -- President Suharto encouraged the 
Indonesian and Singapore Armed Forces yesterday to continue 
working together, saying it was important for the two sides to 
cooperate closely and have a good working relationship. He made 
the comments to visiting Singapore Defence Minister Yeo Ning 
Hong, who paid a courtesy call on the Indonesian leader at the 
Istana Merdeka [Presidential Palace] in central Jakarta. 
  Dr. Yeo, accompanied by the Indonesian Defence and Security 
Minister, retired General Edi Sudrajat, told reporters after the 
half-hour meeting that the discussions centred on general 
defence cooperation matters. 
  While he did not go into the details he said Mr. Suharto 
gave 
his views on the importance of close cooperation between ASEAN 
member-countries. 
  This included defence ties between Singapore and Indonesia, 
which involve regular joint exercises between the air forces and 
navies of the two countries currently, as well as cooperation in 
search and rescue and anti-piracy patrols. 
  Naval and air force exercises have been held since 1974 and 
1980 respectively, but the two armies began exercises only in 
1989 when Indonesian troops were sent to Singapore. This is now 
a regular feature of bilateral cooperation with each country 
hosting the exercises alternately. 
  A 1989 agreement paved the way for such annual army 
exercises 
with benefits for both sides. Among other things, Singapore has 
access to various sites for land training exercises while 
Indonesia gains access to military technology, such as the use 
of training simulators and computer wargaming. 
  Dr. Yeo arrived here in the morning for talks with Gen. 
Sudrajat and to call on President Suharto. A Singapore Defence 
Ministry statement said the visit reflected the warm and close 
ties between Singapore and Indonesia. 
  He left this morning for the Riau provincial capital of 
Pekanbaru in northern Sumatera, where he and Gen. Sudrajat will 
witness the commissioning of an Air Combat Manoeuvring Range 
(ACMR). 
  The range, an air combat training site developed jointly by 
the Indonesian and Singapore armed forces, will be opened by 
Indonesian armed forces chief, General Feisal Tanjung, and 
Singapore Chief of Defence Forces, Major-General Ng Jui Ping. 
  Dr. Yeo, who in August 1991 attended the signing of a 
memorandum of understanding on the development of the range, 
pointed to it as one of a number of joint projects undertaken by 
the two sides over the years. 
  The air combat range augments the Siabu air weapons range, 
opened in 1989 in central Sumatera, which allows the air forces 
of the two countries to conduct air-to-ground training. 
  Dr. Yeo, who is scheduled to return to Singapore this 
afternoon, is accompanied on the Jakarta leg of his visit by the 
Permanent Secretary (Defence), Mr. Lim Siong Guan; the Chief of 
Air Force, Brigadier General Bey Soo Khiang; the Chief of Navy, 
Commodore Kwek Siew Jin; and senior ministry and SAF [Singapore 
Air Force] officers.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Can't the Blockade on Cuba Be Abrogated If </F>
the Embargo on Vietnam Can Be Lifted?"] 
  [Text] The visit by Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
was an eventful one. Apart from signing a cooperation agreement 
on economy and trade with Indonesia, Foreign Minister Robaina 
also briefed Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas on his 
country's problems. 
  It can be said that the Republic of Cuba is one of the five 
communist regimes left in the world. Situated in close proximity 
to the United States, the regime under Fidel Castro's 
leadership, has been under the U.S. economic blockade for almost 
three decades. The Republic of Cuba has withstood the stringent 
economic blockade all this while. Undeniably, Cuba was able to 
weather the blockade due to the Soviet Union's huge subsidies. 
  Apparently, subsidies to Cuba terminated with the collapse 
of 
the Soviet Union. Cuba's economic situation was unquestionably 
threatened due to the termination of the subsidies. Moreover, 
observers believe that Fidel Castro's days are numbered due to 
this reality. 
  That is the reason for Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's 
visit to several Asian nations -- Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia, 
Myanmar [Burma], India, Malaysia, and Vietnam. 
  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's diplomatic tour is aimed 
entirely at mustering sympathy and clarifying Cuba's economic 
situation. Cuba considers the U.S. economic blockade as totally 
unjust. 
  Indonesia, which has close relations with Cuba, is currently 
interested in further upgrading its economic and trade relations 
with Cuba, apart from further improving bilateral political ties. 
  As another developing country in the Nonaligned Movement, 
Indonesia is showing its concern for Cuba. Foreign Minister Ali 
Alatas stated strongly that Indonesia will never accept the 
imposition of the philosophy or ideology of one country on 
another. 
  He said: "We have never accepted the blockade against Cuba. 
Every country has the right to determine its own political 
system." The foreign minister also stated that Indonesia's basic 
foreign policy provides for the right of one country to 
determine its own destiny. That is why Indonesia will never 
accept the United States' economic blockade against Cuba. 
  The blockade against Cuba should give rise to several 
questions, considering the fact that the United States itself 
experienced great resentment over Vietnam. In fact, the United 
States lifted its economic embargo on Vietnam last month. 
  Why does the United states still want to carry on with such 
a 
practise -- the residual heritage of the Cold War, which lasted 
for 34 years? 
  Looking at the historical perspective, the U.S.-Cuban 
conflict reached its climax when the issue of Soviet SS-4 and 
SS-5 missiles was brought to the fore. The United States then 
announced its economic blockade against Cuba in 1962. 
Presently, there are no more missiles in Cuba and the Soviet 
Union has ceased to exist. Therefore, animosity should not exist 
between the two countries anymore. 
  But according to a statement reported by Carlos Batista of 
the INTERNATIONAL PRESS SERVICE, even though Cuba is not 
considered as an offensive "enemy," there are no indications 
that Washington will not change its attitude toward this island 
nation in the Carribean. Besides, John Shalikashvili, commander 
of the U.S. Armed Forces, reiterated that the "rival regime" 
still exists in Havana -- the reason why the U.S. military will 
always remain constantly on alert. 
  We are in no position to study the United States rationale 
in 
detail. Besides, it is our fervent hope that with the present 
changes taking place, the United States will reconsider its 
decision on the economic blockade against Cuba. 
  As a result of the conflict, the United States has to bear 
the responsibility of accepting the flow of emigrants from 
Havana. But Cuba considers the embargo as an "incurable and 
invisible disease which brings along destruction anywhere it 
settles." 
  According to analysts, the embargo has caused Cuba to suffer 
an economic loss of about U.S. $40 billion -- more than five 
times the amount of loans which Cuba has taken from the West. 
The amount is also 20 times more than the total amount of 
Cuba's imports. 
  Certainly, Cuba has blamed the United States for the 
embargo, 
which has caused its people to suffer. There are others who 
share such an opinion, particularly after former U.S. President 
George Bush intensified the blockade through what he termed the 
Torricelli Laws. 
  It is possible that the U.S. decision to prolong the 
blockade 
against Cuba is probably due to the opposition by the 
Miami-based Hispanic and conservative communities. In other 
words, domestic politics have a role in the question of imposing 
the economic blockade. 
  The United States will definitely stress -- as it has 
clarified to the other developing nations -- that the decision 
to lift the embargo will solely depend on Cuban leader Fidel 
Castro's willingness to embark on reforms in his country. 
  But whatever the case may be, Indonesia will definitely 
extend its support to Cuba. It is hoped that similar support 
will be extended by the other Asian countries visited by Foreign 
Minister Robaina.

  [Text] The AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] Civil 
Relations Service (CRS) said yesterday the capture of the 
Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) leader in the Visayas 
and other top local insurgent leaders "may have saved them from 
being liquidated by their own comrades." 
  Citing an intelligence report, the CRS, led by Brig. Gen. 
Rene S. Dado, said a rebel strike force was assigned to kill 
communist leaders led by Arturo Tabara, CPP chief in the Visayas. 
  The liquidation plot was reportedly hatched after Tabara and 
his men defected to the "Revisionist" faction. 
  The plot was detected by military intelligence agents in the 
region. 
  On the other hand, the military is looking into a report 
that 
leaders of the "Stalinist" bloc have sent reinforcements to 
their comrades on Negros Island. 
  "The move was intended to strengthen the remaining Stalinist 
elements on Negros Island and prevent the underground movement 
from falling completely under the control of the rival bloc," 
the CRS added.

  [Text] Top leaders of the National Democratic Front (NDF) 
now living in exile in the Netherlands have expressed their 
willingness to resume anew peace negotiations with government 
representatives based on the joint declaration agreed upon by 
the government and communist leaders in The Hague last year. 
  Tarlac Rep. Jose Yap who is a member of the government 
panel, 
said in a television talk show late Thursday night that NDF 
leader Luis Jalandoni told him over the phone from the 
Netherlands last Sunday that they are willing to proceed with 
the peace talks. 
  Yap said that after their exploratory talks with Jalandoni 
and Jose Ma. Sison, founder of the Communist Party of the 
Philippines (CPP) who is also seeking political asylum in the 
Netherlands, the peace initiative will now deal with the 
establishment of committee level talks in preparation for the 
holding of formal negotiations. 
  The peace negotiations with top leaders of the CPP, the New 
People's Army (NPA), and the NDF have remained suspended 
following a deadlock on the issue of venue. 
  While the government has adopted a "shifting venue" concept 
as part of the confidence-building process, Hague-based NDF 
leaders led by Sison have not made any decision on their choice 
for the next meeting place with government representatives. 
  The initial choice of the NDF was in Hanoi, Vietnam, but 
Sison later rejected the venue for still undetermined reasons. 
  On the other hand, former communist leader Saturnino Ocampo 
said that the impending amnesty declaration of President Ramos 
should not provoke the NDF into changing its position of 
including the rebels who have not availed of the government's 
amnesty package. 
  Ocampo also opposed the imposition of a deadline on the 
peace 
negotiations once the presidential amnesty for rebels, may it be 
conditional or unconditional, has been declared by the Chief 
Executive. 
  Col. Rufo de Veyra, spokesman of the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines (AFP), declined to issue any comment on the possible 
effects of President Ramos' amnesty package, adding that any 
statement on the issue will only be speculative. 
  However, any decision made by the president with regard to 
the amnesty issue will be fully supported by the military, he 
said. 
<H5>  Joint Meeting </H5>
  President Ramos has called the chairmen and members of the 
three government peace panels to a joint meeting in Malacanang 
[presidential office] on Monday, 21 March, to review the 
progress of the peace process with all the rebel groups in the 
country. 
  In a handwritten memorandum, the president instructed 
Executive Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr. to also invite 
advisers from the Cabinet, Senate, and House of Representatives 
to attend the conference. 
  During the meeting, the Office of the Presidential Adviser 
on 
the Peace Process (OPAPP) will brief those attending the meeting 
on the status of the peace negotiations with the Moro National 
Liberation Front (MNLF), the National Democratic Front-New 
People's Army- Communist Party of the Philippines, and the 
military rebels. 
<H5>  Internal Reforms </H5>
  Camp Capinpin, Tanay, Rizal -- Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, 
Philippine Army commander, said yesterday that with peace within 
"arm's reach," his command has embarked on a program of 
sustaining internal reforms and upgrading equipment and 
resources as part of its general shift from counter-insurgency 
to external defense of the nation. 
  Speaking at the 18th anniversary celebration of the Army's 
Second Infantry (Jungle Fighters) Division, Enrile said that the 
military has already dismantled the political-military structure 
of the New People's Army (NPA) in most parts of the country, 
particularly in the Southern Luzon and Bicol countrysides. 
  He said that the communist rebels have now been pushed 
deeper 
into mountain enclaves where they are isolated and deprived of 
the popular support essential in the conduct of the insurgency 
war. 
  Enrile praised the officers and men of the Army division 
under Brig Gen. Regino Lacson for having done much toward the 
achievement of peace in Southern Luzon and Bicol. 
  Enrile also cited the Army division's "Galloping Clouds" 
campaign that maximize the opportunities to reach out to the 
masses and "give an entirely new and larger meaning to the 
traditional concept as a civil military operation."

  [Text] President Fidel V. Ramos on Tuesday directed 
Executive Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr. to formally withdraw 
from the Commission on Appointment the nomination of Tomas Gomez 
III as consul-general to Los Angeles (L.A.), California. The 
president issued the instruction after Gomez, former press 
secretary of ex-President Corazon C. Aquino, asked him to 
withdraw his nomination during a 30-minute meeting with the 
president. Gomez said in a letter he gave to President Ramos, 
and I [broadcaster] quote, the Commission on Appointments 
developments concerning my going to Los Angeles have become 
untenable and it appears that I may have become a liability to 
you when the least I could do is not to add to the burden that 
the president already has. It was evident that the foreign 
affairs community is not at all bothered that its very own 
constitutional process has been knowingly mocked and abused by a 
witness who lied under solemn affirmation, unquote, or Gomez, at 
the second statement, was referring to Dr. Carlos Manlapaz who 
accused Gomez of making anti-Ilocano statements. The former 
press secretary stressed he has not asked to be posted to Los 
Angeles. It was Secretary Roberto Romulo's suggestion, the 
foreign affairs secretary, that he accepted his posting which he 
[Romulo] recommended to the president.

  [Text] Australia and the Philippines have agreed to 
cooperate closely on energy to help boost trade and investments 
between the two countries, Australian Trade Minister Robert 
McMullan said. 
  He said an Australian energy mission will visit Manila in 
May 
to coincide with the first meeting of the proposed joint working 
group on energy. 
  "We expect it (mission) to find a lot of trade opportunities 
for Australia... and provide opportunities for the Philippines 
to take initiatives to resolve its energy situation," McMullan 
told reporters at the airport before leaving Manila on Saturday 
[19 March]. 
  The trade official arrived on Thursday as part of a tour of 
member-countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
and is to visit Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. 
  Australia had been helping the Philippines in the oil 
exploration field. 
  Only recently, the Australian Government financed the survey 
work on several prospective oil-bearing structures in the 
Philippines . 
  The first report on the results of the survey was released 
last month and pointed to the areas where oil reserves could 
have accumulated over the years. 
  The drilling season is set to start next month and several 
local and foreign oil exploration companies will be searching 
for oil in offshore Palawan, Mindoro, and the Sulu Sea. 
  The Philippines depends on imported crude. Recent oil 
discoveries have helped cut these imports. One of the country's 
biggest oil strikes, the Linapacan oil field off Palawan, 
initially produced at least 15,000 barrels a day until water 
started to seep into the pipe. 
  Two foreign firms -- Shell Exploration and Occidental 
Petroleum -- are working on the development of a much bigger oil 
structure called the Malampaya field. This structure contains a 
sizable amount of natural gas and crude oil.

  [Text] The Australian Government has welcomed the new 
constitutional framework for Bosnia agreed to in Washington. 
The country's Muslims and Croats have signed a pact creating a 
new federation within the former Yugoslav Republic. The Bosnian 
Serbs, who control 70 percent of Bosnia, refused to be in on the 
deal. Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans says 
peace cannot be fully restored without the active participation 
of the Serbs. Senator Evans said Australia hoped the Serbs 
would join the Croats and Muslims in concluding a comprehensive 
agreement to settle the conflict in Bosnia.

  [Text] Australians serving long sentences in Thai prisons 
may soon be transferred to Australian jails. A prisoner 
exchange agreement is one of several issues raised during talks 
in Canberra between the foreign minister, Gareth Evans, and his 
visiting Thai counterpart, Prasong Sunsiri. Graeme Dobell 
reports if the agreement goes ahead, it will be Australia's 
first prisoner exchange treaty: 
  [Begin Dobell recording] There are more than 20 Australian 
prisoners in Thai jails, most serving long sentences for drug 
convictions. After the talks between the two foreign ministers, 
officials said both sides were keen on the prisoner exchange 
idea and there was an in-principle agreement. Senator Evans 
said the federal government needed to sort out administrative 
problems with the Australian states -- which have control of 
prisons -- so an agreement with Thailand could be settled in the 
next few months. [end recording]

  [Text] A group of 75 US congressmen, led by John Spratt, 
Head of the Congressional Textile Caucus, has urged US Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor to take retaliatory measures 
against nine major textile exporters, including Thailand, 
charging them with failing to satisfactorily open their markets 
for access of US textile exports by a February 15 deadline. 
  According to a report from the Thai Commercial Counsellor in 
Washington to the Commerce Permanent Secretary, the nine textile 
and garment exporters targetted for US action are Indonesia, 
Egypt, Pakistan, India, Thailand, Korea, Hong Kong, Turkey and 
the Philippines. 
  The report maintained that the US textile group cast doubt 
on 
whether the US government could achieve success in its 
market-opening talks with other countries under the Uruguay 
Round negotiations, which is scheduled to be endorsed on April 
15. 
  The group was disappointed as the US could not negotiate to 
prolong the textile agreement. It demanded the government do 
what it had promised: open foreign markets for US products like 
the US market is opened for foreign imports. 
  The group has proposed the US government impose retaliatory 
measures against countries failing to satisfactorily open their 
markets for US products. 
  The measures proposed include: 
  -- Increasing customs duties on major textile products. 
  -- Opposing membership applications to the World Trade 
Organisation. 
  -- Cancelling the generalised system of preference 
privileges.

<F P=106> [By Walailak Kiratiphiphatphong] </F>
  [Text] Businessmen who were part of Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai's delegation to Vietnam last week say they are confident 
that the agreement signed by the governments of Thailand and 
Vietnam will build better bilateral economic and investment ties. 
  The businessmen appreciate the Bank of Thailand's policy of 
allowing qualified Vietnamese companies and Thai-Vietnamese 
joint ventures to be listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in 
the future. 
  They say the move will be an incentive for local firms to 
invest more outside Thailand. 
  Dr Som Chatusiphithak, chairman of the Thai Bankers' 
Association, and Wichian Techaphaibun, vice-president of the 
Board of Trade of Thailand have backed the central bank's 
decision to expand loans through the Bangkok International 
Banking Facilities (BIBF) scheme. 
  They say both moves will boost Thailand's push to become a 
regional financial centre. 
  The two share the view that it is time the Thai Government 
offered investment perks for local businessmen to expand their 
investments abroad, not just providing such privileges for local 
investment as at present. 
  Difficulties over monetary regulations include the allowable 
limit of funds to be taken out for investment abroad, says Mr 
Wichian, who is also the president of Bangkok Metropolitan Bank. 
  Thanin Chiarawanon, chairman of the Charoen Phokphan Group, 
says that even where the two countries have something in common, 
such as in agricultural goods, Thailand should not consider 
Vietnam as a rival in exporting. However, the government should 
promote and support local businessmen to invest here to make 
Vietnam partially a production base. 
  Wikrom Kromadit, president of Bangpakong Industrial Park 2 
Co, echoes this view. He says the Board of Investment should 
act as an agency to encourage investment abroad, like the Japan 
External Trade Organisation. 
  He sees better prospects for bilateral ties after the Chuan 
visit, but he thinks real action or real investment from 
Thailand is much needed. 
  Mr Wikrom says his Long Binh Industrial Estate project, for 
which the contract was signed during the Chuan visit to Vietnam, 
will, if completed, become the hub of Thai investment in Vietnam. 
  He aims to provide several services including seeking 
Vietnamese partners and investment consultancy over rules and 
regulations here. 
  Many Thai products, for example canned pineapple, canned 
tuna 
and other canned seafood products, have a good reputation in 
foreign markets, and it is thus possible to shift the 
manufacturing base to Vietnam while using the same Thai brand 
names. 
  During the visit, there were two agreements on tourism 
cooperation an agreement between the Federation of Thai 
Industries and Vietnam's State Committee for Cooperation and 
Investment; and four joint investment contracts between Thai 
firms and Vietnamese government agencies. Mr Chuan witnessed 
the signing of the contracts.

  [Text] Heavy fighting was reported close to the Thai border 
between Khmer Rouge soldiers and troops of the Cambodian 
Government. There was an influx of refugees as well as shells 
landing in Thailand, opposite Khok Sabaeng Village in Tambon 
Thakham, Aranyaprathet District, Sa Kaeo Province. The fighting 
lasted over two hours. Twelve mortar rounds landed at Wat Khok 
Sabaeng; a house was damaged. There was no report on death or 
injuries. 
  According to information from the Cambodians who fled the 
fighting to the Thai border, two Cambodian border patrol police 
officials and three Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed. Thai 
soldiers and border patrol police have been put on alert to 
prevent infiltration and violation of national sovereignty. 
There were sounds of gunfire from the fighting between the 
Cambodian factions. 
  Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak said that about 
35,000 
Cambodian civilians fled to the Thai border, and Thailand is 
giving them help for humanitarian reasons. He said the UNHCR 
[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] had been 
informed to provide assistance to the refugees. He, however, 
confirmed that Thailand will not reopen refugee centers and will 
push all those people over the border once the fighting is over. 
  Concerning a report saying the Cambodian Government is using 
chemical weapons in operations against the Khmer Rouge, Gen. 
Wichit said he had no information about that, but believed the 
world would object to such a plan.

  [Text] Chokchai Aksoranan, chairman of the Thai Federation 
of Industries, received a trade delegation from China's Jiangsu 
Province led by Hong Zhenxin. Chokchai said there are bright 
prospects for Thai investment in China in areas such as factory 
development, infrastructure construction, and retailing. Thai 
investors can also export construction materials for projects in 
China. Simultaneously, there are good opportunities for Chinese 
entrepreneurs to invest in Thailand to produce goods for export 
to Indochina. This will help save transportation costs. 
  Moreover, China's cooperation with ASEAN countries and the 
quadrangle economic development project invovling China, 
Thailand, Laos, and Burma will enable this region to become an 
important area of greater economic prosperity. Now, some Thai 
products such as motorcycles, kitchen ware, consumer products, 
and construction materials have penetrated the Indochinese 
market. However, countries in each region have set up regional 
trade groups. This has prompted Thailand to enhance its 
competitiveness in the market by improving development analyses 
or relocating production bases to other countries with cheaper 
labor costs. Labor cost in Thailand is much higher than in 
neighboring countries. 
  The Chinese chief delegate said Wuxi city has registered the 
rapid economic growth rate of 25 percent, the highest in Jiangsu 
Province. There are over 140,000 factories in the city. There 
are also some 3,669 foreign-owned factories with a combined 
investment of U.S. $2,900 million. Chinese entrepreneurs are 
interested in investing in metallurgical and rubber industries 
in Thailand.

  [Text] Six incidents involving explosive devices have been 
recorded this month and all, with the exception of the foiled 
attack supposedly on the Israeli Embassy last week, were 
intended to undermine government stability, Interior Minister 
Chawalit Yongchaiyut said yesterday. 
  "The incidents that took place can be divided into two 
categories. The first involves people wanting to put political 
pressure on the government, while those responsible for the 
second category are terrorists," Chawalit said at a press 
conference after a 90-minute meeting with senior police officers. 
  Chawalit said the March 3 grenade assault on Social Action 
leader Montri Phongphanit's home, the March 8 bomb attack on a 
train in Songkhla's Chana district, the March 9 grenade attack 
on Deputy Permanent Secretary for Interior Sawai Phramani, the 
March 13 grenade attack on the Nakhon Phanom governor's 
residence and the March 20 blast in downtown Hat Ya in Songkhla 
province fell into the first category. 
  The truckload of explosive materials which was believed to 
be 
aimed at the Israeli Embassy last Thursday was the work of 
international terrorists the interior minister said. 
  "I call on the public to remain calm and analyze the 
situation carefully to arrive at a rational conclusion. I have 
told you before that I will take responsibility for everything 
that happens," he said. But he claimed the attacks carried out 
by disaffected political elements with the aim of destabilizing 
the government were not of national significance. 
  "For example, the grenade attack in Nakhon Phanom (at the 
provincial governor's home) may be a mistake on the part of the 
assailants," he said. 
  "Acts of terrorism usually intensify and eventually lead to 
armed struggle, which is exactly what happened in our country in 
the past," he said. 
  Chawalit said his meeting with senior police officers, led 
by 
Police Director General Pratin Santipraphop, was to review the 
political implications of the incidents and to find ways to 
effectively deal with them. 
  He said he was satisfied with police investigations into the 
incidents. But he could not set a deadline for the cases, which 
he described as difficult to be solved because those involved 
are not "common criminals". 
  "Bringing the perpetrators to justice is not beyond the arm 
of the law," the minister said. 
  Chawalit said he was summoned by Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai 
yesterday morning for a briefing on the latest developments in 
the investigation into the cases. 
  Police sources said the interior minister imposed a code of 
silence on all senior police officers except Pol Gen Pratin. 
  Pratin, asked to comment on criticism that police always 
failed to catch people committing terrorist acts, said: "I 
think we will fail to arrest any of them again this time." 
  Khachatphai Burutphat, deputy secretary general of the 
National Security Council, said he briefed the prime minister on 
the terrorist attacks during a two-hour meeting yesterday. 
  "Thailand should not be made a target of terrorist attacks. 
We denounce all acts of international terrorism that affect our 
internal security," Khachatphai said. 
  Deputy Chat Thai leader Sano Tianthong said Chawalit should 
show responsibility for the violence by stepping down because 
the Police Department under his ministry had failed to solve 
serious crimes, particularly acts of terrorism. 
  "It is interesting to note that there have been many bomb 
attacks since Chawalit took office as interior minister. The 
interior minister is not supposed to shirk his responsibility 
now," Sano said. 
  The deputy Chat Thai leader said he believed the violence 
could be attributed to local disaffected political groups as 
well as international terrorists.

  [Text] According to a source at the Police Department, on 
the night of 21 March, there was an urgent message from the U.S. 
intelligence service to U.S. officials working with Thai police 
investigating a plot that involved a one-ton truck-load of 
explosives found on 17 March. The message said that the 
fugitive terrorists had not left the country but were still 
hiding in Thailand. It has also been found that the group has 
shifted their objective from the targeted embassy to 
assasination attempts against high-level officials of that same 
embassy. "Major targets are high-level officials of the U.S. 
and Israeli Embassies, as well as those at the Pakistani and 
some other embassies," the source said. 
  The source also revealed that U.S. and Thai intelligence 
authorities found that, on the day the terrorist abandoned the 
truck, he left a black James Bond briefcase on the truck. It is 
believed the briefcase contained some important documents. But 
the case disappeared during the time the truck was parked near 
the Lumphini police station. The Police Department and the 
Metropolitan Police Division have already set up a committee to 
investigate how the briefcase disappeared. 
  However, police officials at the Metropolitan Police Office 
declined to discuss this with reporters. They said they were 
not authorized to give information to newsmen, and that 
reporters should ask the police director or the metropolitan 
police commissioner if they want information. 
  Meanwhile, Police Colonel Suraphon Thongprasoet of the 
Special Branch Police called an urgent meeting of Special Branch 
police officials in charge of security for important persons, 
especially those from diplomatic missions. The non-stop meeting 
on 21 March began at 0900 and ended at 1430. A police inspector 
reported that there was an instruction at the meeting that 
security be stepped up for 24-hour protection of officials and 
important persons at foreign embassies. There will be an 
increase in the number of security officials guarding residences 
of ambassadors as well as embassies, especially the Israeli and 
U.S. Embassies. The Thai police will maintain around-the-clock 
coordination with the U.S. intelligence service. 
  An officer of the Metropolitan Police in charge of security 
protection for important persons told newsmen that police 
officials had been assigned to guard important premises and 
residences of important persons, particularly foreign embassies. 
The Metropolitan Police will guard the outside areas of the 
compound whereas the Special Branch Police will provide security 
at the residences of ambassadors and foreign embassies.

  [Text] Yala -- Helicopters from the Pattani-based 
Civilian-Police-Military [CPM] Command 43 yesterday began 
air-strikes against a camp of separatist bandits under Ma Sungai 
Batu of the Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) on Kudong Mountain 
in Yaha District. 
  Col Phongsak Ekbannasing, deputy commander of CPM-43, said 
the air attacks were launched on intelligence confirmed by 
aerial reconnaissance that about 30 separatists were at the camp. 
  Three helicopters from Sirinthorn Camp in Pattani's Yarang 
District attacked the camp twice yesterday with machineguns. 
  At the same time, troops were deployed at the foot of the 
mountain to intercept the bandits fleeing the air attacks which 
would continue for five days, he said. 
  Seven government soldiers were wounded last week when a 
government force activated two landmines on Kudong Mountain 
while patrolling the area. 
  Two of the wounded lost their left leg in the mine 
explosion.

  [Text] The Danish-US consortium led by Maersk Olie Og Gas 
A/S is enjoying outstanding success in its quest for 
hydrocarbons in the central Gulf of Thailand. 
  The group has struck what appear to be promising crude, gas 
and condensate accumulations at three of the five wells drilled 
in block B8/32. 
  That may represent the most successful rate among those 
obtained by foreign groups awarded concession rights in the last 
round of petroleum licencing called in July 1990. 
  The results strengthen beliefs that more oil and gas 
deposits 
could still be found in other areas of the Gulf, other than 
those currently under production and development. 
  According to Maersk Oil (Thailand) resident manager Niels 
Haun, well Tantawan-1 tested at 6,250 barrels per day (b/d) of 
crude oil and 25.7 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd) of gas, 
while the second well Tantawan-2 flowed at 1,760 b/d of 
condensate and 70.5 MMcfd of gas. 
  The last discovery well completed recently, Tantawan-3, 
encountered several hydrocarbon-bearing zones and subsequently 
five zones were tested with a combined flow rate of 40 MMcfd of 
gas and 8,862 b/d of crude oil and condensate. 
  Tantawan-3, the fifth well drilled in the tract, was bored 
to 
10,526 feet. The well was drilled from a surface location some 
three kilometres north of the Tantawan-1 well, the first 
discovery well. 
  While the other two wells are dry holes, Mr Haun told 
Business Post the results of the $30-million exploration work 
carried out so far had been very encouraging. 
  Consequently, the consortium decided to proceed with the 
drilling of two additional exploratory wells in the block which 
are expected to cost $6-7 million. 
  Drilling of these wells will be carried out by a Sedco 601 
semi- submersible, the same rig used to drill the first five 
wells, starting in mid-1994. 
  Mr Haun said it is too early to say if the petroleum finds 
were sizable enough for commercial production. "We need to 
continue with evaluation and analysis and look into the results 
of the two additional wells before we can draw some conclusions. 
"With the exploration work already undertaken, the consortium 
has exceeded the obligations spelt out in the concession 
agreement awarded in August 1991, Mr Haun said. The consortium 
was obliged to spend a minimum of $13.5 million in exploration 
work over the 10,664-square- kilometre block during the first 
three-year obligation period. The work obligations included 
4,000 km of seismic lines and drilling of three wells. 
  Maersk Oil of Denmark operates the tract on behalf of the 
joint venture comprising Thaipo Ltd (31.67 percent), Thai Ramo 
Ltd (31.67 percent) and the Sophonpanich Co (5 percent). Maersk 
has a 31.67 percent interest in the tract. 
  "We have been doing what we are supposed to do, then we 
leave 
it to somebody to evaluate whether it is successful or not. The 
only thing I can say is we are satisfied with the results we 
have obtained so far," Mr Haun said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 23 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said Wednesday the government would keep open a dialogue channel 
with Pyongyang, while increasing cooperation with the United 
States, Japan, China, Russia and other countries in dealing with 
the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  Kim made the remarks at a breakfast he hosted for Prime 
Minister Yi Hoe-chang, other cabinet members and his senior 
secretaries at Chongwadae [presidential offices] prior to 
departing for Japan and China on state visits Thursday. 
  "North Korea is secretly developing nuclear arms despite its 
promise of denuclearization and is increasing propaganda 
broadcasts against the South to instigate people to topple the 
government," he said. "What we can and must do now is win this 
fight without a war." 
  Kim said he would use his meetings with Japanese Premier 
Morihiro Hosokawa and Chinese President Jiang Zemin as an 
opportunity to ask for their cooperation in settling the North 
Korean nuclear row. 
  "North Korea has been insincere and perfidious in the 
dialogue with us and I thus expected the dialogue to break down. 
But the situation that developed last Saturday was far beyond 
my imagination. I cannot help regarding the harsh language used 
by the chief North Korean delegate while reading from a prepared 
text, not as that spoken by the delegate himself but as words 
uttered by the supreme authority of Pyongyang." 
  The government should tell the people the truth to help 
develop its own national power, he stressed. 
  The government should not create a sense of crisis among the 
people, as its predecessors did in exaggerating the threat posed 
by a North Korean water attack, solely to establish its position 
more firmly. 
  The chief executive noted that irresponsible remarks are 
being made in certain quarters despite the fact that the people 
are aware of North Korea's intention since they have access to 
North Korean broadcasting through TV. He said the government 
should inform all citizens of any developments pertaining to 
their safety. 
  On the Patriot deployment, he said the anti-missile missiles 
are an improved version of those used in the Gulf war and will 
thus play an important part in the nation's defense. 
  Kim said he expects the UN Security Council will start with 
a 
mild resolution on North Korea, with the approach gradually 
escalating depending on Pyongyang's response. "The government 
will cooperate closely with the U.S. Government if developments 
in the dispute at the UN Security Council warrant such 
cooperation." 
  He said he had taken steps to ensure that he can receive 
reports from the government 24 hours a day during his seven-day 
tour of Japan and China.

  [Text] Seoul, March 22 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul government 
grabbed "the stick" and considered using it Tuesday as the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] sent the North Korean 
nuclear issue back to the United Nations Security Council. 
  The government's North Korea policy was finally pushed into 
a 
hard-line corner by the aggressive and crude remarks made by the 
chief North Korean delegate to an inter-Korean working-level 
contact last Saturday, when he threatened war against the South. 
  Realizing the futility of efforts to persuade Pyongyang to 
accept full IAEA inspections and help resolve the nuclear issue 
through dialogue, officials at Chongwadae [presidential office] 
and national security-related ministries huddled to discuss 
countermeasures against further North Korean provocation. 
  President Kim Yong-sam said Tuesday his government has asked 
the United States to deploy Patriot anti-missile missiles across 
the country as soon as possible. 
  South Korea and the United States have also agreed in 
principle to resume their joint military exercise "Team Spirit" 
this year. President Kim said a final decision on the war games 
will be made after he visits Japan and China. 
  Kim disclosed these plans at a meeting of senior Democratic 
Liberal Party officials including Chairman Kim Chong-pil and 
four party postholders. 
  Almost at the same time, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and 
Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae met with U.S. Ambassador to Seoul 
James Laney and the commander of U.S. Forces in Korea, Gen. Gary 
Luck, to discuss the deployment of Patriot missiles here and the 
Team Spirit exercise. 
  Senior Presidential Secretary for Foreign and National 
Security Affairs Chong Chong-uk noted, "There has been nearly no 
change in North Korea's attitude since it announced its 
intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
last March. 
  "North Korea obviously wants to pursue its policy of 
improving relations with the United States while delaying 
inter-Korean dialogue with the eventual aim of eliminating 
Seoul's links with the United States," Chong said. 
  North Korea's use of "such a nuclear card," however, will no 
longer be effective, Chong declared. 
  At the hour-long breakfast meeting with ruling party 
leaders, 
President Kim expressed confidence that the South would repel 
any kind of provocation from North Korea. 
  After recalling all instances in which Pyongyang 
unilaterally 
frustrated Seoul's sincere attempts at dialogue and 
reconciliation, Kim said, "I did not expect the North to bring 
up talk of war last Saturday." 
  The matter was especially appalling because the North Korean 
chief delegate did not speak spontaneously but was reading a 
statement prepared earlier in Pyongyang, Kim said. 
  "Since we do not want the North isolated from the world 
community, we will leave the door open for dialogue," Kim said. 
  "But war should never break out on the Korean peninsula 
again 
under any circumstances. Preventing war is possible only when 
we are strong," Kim said, explaining his reason for ordering the 
deployment of Patriot missiles and considering resumption of 
Team Spirit this year. 
  The main opposition Democratic Party [DP], meanwhile, 
counselled the government Tuesday to refrain from "physical 
sanctions" against North Korea in favor of dialogue. 
  "If the government has determined that there is no immediate 
danger of war, it should be cautious in deciding on the 
deployment of the Patriot missiles and resumption of Team 
Spirit," said the party following a meeting of its policy-making 
Supreme Council. 
  "No one should be allowed to heighten tension on the Korean 
peninsula," the party said in a statement. "Resolution of the 
North Korean nuclear issue has to be made through a package 
deal." 
  The proposed exchange of special envoys between Seoul and 
Pyongyang will also have to be undertaken not as a precondition 
to resolve the issue but at the same time, the party said. 
  The DP then urged North Korea to accept IAEA inspection of 
its nuclear facilities to guarantee transparency of nuclear 
safeguards and apologize for the chief delegate's statement that 
"Seoul will turn into a sea of fire if war breaks out." 
  In addition, the opposition party pointed out that the Seoul 
government should have a consistent North Korea policy. 
  Kim Tae-chung, former chairman of the Democratic Party, said 
he "could not help being aghast at the sea-of-fire statement by 
the North Korean delegate," according to his spokesman, Chong 
Tong-chae. 
  Kim Tae-chung was extremely shocked after reading the 
remark, 
since the North Korean regime has been saying it was for "the 
people of Korea" whenever there was a chance. 
  Kim, however, advised South Korea to avoid being taken in by 
such an irrational provocation, Chong said.

<F P=106> [From the "Reporter's Memorandum" column by Chong Chong-sik, </F>
director of the European News Headquarters in Vienna: 
"International Atomic Energy Agency's `Limitations'"] 
  [Text] It took a mere two hours and 15 minutes for the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to refer the North 
Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. 
  All delegates to the IAEA Board of Governors looked 
relieved. 
  The IAEA dropped the North Korean nuclear issue as the 
United 
States and other powerful countries thought it would. They had 
chosen this approach among many possibilities because the IAEA 
governors would easily accept this formula without opposition. 
  It has been proven that this approach had been correctly 
chosen. Hours before the meeting began, it had been speculated 
that the meeting would conclude the discussion in a few hours. 
The IAEA spokesman frequently came out of the meeting room and 
smiled, as if to say that the meeting was progressing well. 
  When we analyze the entire scene, we realize that the IAEA 
does not want to do its duty regarding the North Korean nuclear 
issue. The IAEA should be involved in and resolve any nuclear 
issue worldwide. This time, however, the IAEA referred the 
North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, where 
"power" is applied to resolve issues. This, in a sense, is an 
act of shirking its duty, which the French delegate severely 
criticized. 
  When the governors cast votes on the IAEA resolution, they 
did so after examining if it would be correct for them to refer 
the North Korean nuclear issue to the `power' of international 
politics, not if North Korea had really rejected nuclear 
inspections. 
  The UN Security Council will decide on the North Korean 
nuclear issue based on the interests of various member nations 
and the power structure of international politics. Each country 
involved, however, expressed its view on this issue at the IAEA 
Board of Governors meeting. A majority of governors voted for 
the resolution because they agreed they should deal with the 
North Korean nuclear issue by mustering the "will of the world" 
at the United Nations. Some of the governors abstained after 
examining their own interests and nonnuclear concerns. 
  Five among the 35 governors abstained. This means 
one-seventh expressed semiopposition on this issue. 
  The IAEA stressed that it would absolve North Korea anytime 
it receives nuclear inspections. The prevailing opinion, 
however, was that no IAEA governor expected that North Korea 
would do so.

  [Text] Seoul, March 23 (YONHAP) -- The National Assembly's 
Foreign Affairs and National Unification and National Defense 
Committees met Wednesday to hear reports from the Kim 
administration on the escalating tension on the peninsula 
triggered by the North Korean nuclear dispute. 
  The committees also looked into the security situation as 
North Korea threatened war after rupturing the inter-Korean 
contact last Saturday, and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) referred the nuclear issue to the United Nations 
Security Council for possible sanctions. 
  "In case North Korea changes its posture in order to avoid 
U.N. sanctions, the Kim administration will map out active 
measures to take the initiative on inter-Korean problems," 
Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok told the Foreign Affairs and 
National Unification Committee. 
  Yi, also minister of the National Unification Board, said he 
will monitor North Korea's reaction to discussions at the U.N. 
Security Council. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said the key to resolving the 
nuclear question lies in either U.N. sanctions or securing 
China's cooperation. 
  The government is expected to make a strong push for Chinese 
cooperation when President Kim visits Beijing next week, Han 
said. 
  "If North Korea determines that there is no possibility of 
improving its relations with the United States, it may take 
drastic action," Han said. "It is necessary to maintain a 
channel of dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang." 
  But as long as North Korea fails to honor its promises, 
there 
will be no third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks, 
Han said. 
  Neither South Korea nor the United States intends to 
compromise on the basic issues with North Korea, Han said. 
  The foreign minister also said the world community should 
refrain from adopting an emotional hard-line stance against 
Pyongyang that could backfire. 
  U.N. Security Council sanctions should be applied in stages, 
Han added. 
  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae told the National Defense 
Committee that South Korea and the United States are currently 
negotiating the timing of the joint military exercise Team 
Spirit. Dates in late April, mid-May or sometime after June 
were mentioned, according to Yi. 
  "Since North Korea could not satisfy the two conditions for 
the suspension of Team Spirit, the resumption of the exercise 
this year is unavoidable," Yi said. 
  Practical military maneuvers such as river crossings and 
emergency landings will be added to the annual Team Spirit to 
realize the participation of the fewest troops for maximum 
effect, Yi said. 
  The Patriot anti-missile missiles, soon to be deployed by 
the 
U.S. Forces in Korea, will also be used in the exercise, he said. 
  One Patriot missile battalion is capable of taking on 55 
incoming enemy aircraft, Yi said, adding that "its ability to 
destroy Scud missiles in the air is an additional function." 
  Yi said Seoul and Washington will determine the dates for 
Team Spirit with maximum training and demonstrative effects in 
mind. He said the military also hopes to avoid busy farming 
periods. 
  Once the two countries announce the resumption of the war 
games, it would be difficult to turn back, he said. 
  The defense minister said, "there are no signs that North 
Korea will launch a provocation within a short period of time." 
  "But we cannot rule out the possibility if the U.N. Security 
Council starts deliberating sanctions," he added. 
  In order to prepare for all eventualities, the government is 
working out measures in two stages -- one before and the other 
after the U.N. Security Council decides on sanctions, Yi said. 
  In the first stage, the Armed Forces will strengthen 
surveillance, hold regular meetings of the South Korean-U.S. 
Military Committee, report on strategy to the commander of the 
allied forces and request that part of a rapid reaction force be 
deployed, he said. 
  Moreover, Yi said he will urge the government to request the 
United Nations to build up its deterrent potential, he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Chong-tu: "There Is No Special Sign of </F>
Provocation From the North Korean Military"] 
  [Text] At the 19 March South-North working-level contact, 
North Korea made the remark: "Seoul will become a sea of fire." 
Since then, military authorities have been assiduously analyzing 
the true intention of such a remark and have been very sensitive 
to the conduct of the North Korean military. An analysis of 
their behavior since 22 March by military authorities reveals 
that such a remark stems from a high-powered strategy and tactic 
to occupy favorable ground in the negotiations with the South 
and the United States. No signs of aggression can be detected 
in the conduct of the North Korean military. According to 
military intelligence sources, the North Korean military is 
currently carrying out winter season training exercises. North 
Korea is carrying out large-scale military training exercises. 
It designates December to March as the winter season training 
period and July to August as the summer season training period. 
The winter season training period exercises, including joint 
infantry, tank, and artillery mobile exercises, are more intense 
than during the summer season training period. Regardless of 
the remark by the North Korean delegate, the recent conduct of 
the North Korean military shows that it is carrying out normal 
training. The only difference is that the intensity is enhanced 
and the number of training exercises has increased. This is a 
common method used when South-North dialogue and DPRK-U.S. talks 
are not progressing well. 
  Even though there is no clear sign of provocation attracting 
our interest, the Defense Ministry is not breaking its vigilant 
position because the North Korean military is increasing the 
number of training exercises, which is worthy of close 
attention. Including the armistice line region, North Korea 
deployed to the front line 65 percent of its ground forces; 60 
percent of its vessels; and 40 percent of its fighter planes 
along the region south of Pyongyang and Wonsan. Therefore, 
North Korea, which has been propagandizing 1995 as the "year for 
reunification," completed a military deployment strong enough 
for a full large-scale invasion of the South. North Korea has 
also sharply increased exercises that were reduced in 1980. 
Moreover, the frontline corps of the North Korean Army 
increased exercises by 40 percent, the Navy 15 percent, and the 
Air Force 30 percent, compared with last year. These actions 
are making the military authorities tense. The military is 
closely observing the moves by the North Korean military based 
on a list of approximately 100 signs indicating moves for a 
southward invasion. Not even 10 percent of the signs from the 
list have been observed in the current conduct of the North 
Korean military. Nevertheless, the military authorities are 
frequently holding contacts with U.S. forces stationed in the 
ROK to discuss the conduct of the North Korean military. 
  On 22 March, the Defense Ministry examined prolonging the 
"time- limited readiness," which has been carried out since 1 
November 1993, until the crisis on the Korean peninsula is 
improved to some degree. Also, before and after President Kim 
Yong-sam's visit to Japan and China, a special alert was ordered 
for the whole Army. This is a measure that will allow an 
immediate reaction to a possible provocation from North Korea.

<F P=106> [By Son Chae-kyu] </F>
  [Text] Washington, March 22 (YONHAP) -- Talk of war on the 
Korean peninsula is flaring up again as the UN Security Council 
prepares a resolution on North Korea next week, but the 
prevalent feeling here is that it is just that -- talk. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton has already confirmed that 
Patriot missiles will be deployed in South Korea, and press 
reports here say the Pentagon is seriously considering 
additional measures such as strengthening American forces in 
South Korea, placing aircraft carriers near the peninsula and 
preparing for chemical warfare. 
  Secretary of State Warren Christopher added to the hysteria 
Tuesday, saying the effectiveness of U.S. diplomatic efforts is 
in doubt. 
  But working-level officials believe otherwise. 
  The WASHINGTON POST reported on the additional military 
measures on the Korean peninsula, while emphasizing that 
Washington has yet to set a definitive policy direction. 
  The Department of Defense has drawn up multiple contingency 
plans in case war breaks out anywhere in the world, and planning 
on the Korean peninsula remains within this framework, it said. 
  State Department officials said no military action has been 
decided except the Patriot deployment. Department Spokesman 
Mike McCurry made a point of repeating that the Patriot missiles 
and the South Korean-U.S. military drill Team Spirit are both 
purely defensive in nature. 
  Nevertheless, there are ominous signs. Defense officials 
last week confirmed reports that U.S. aircraft carriers, 
including the Independence and Abraham Lincoln, and warships are 
conducting operations near the peninsula. 
  The operations, taking place just a couple of thousand miles 
from the East Sea, are the first such maneuvers in months and 
are tied to the possibility of holding Team Spirit. 
  The official explanation is that the operations were planned 
in advance and are unrelated to the current tension in Korea. A 
fleet of that size requires considerable time to dispatch, 
meaning the carriers and warships were on their way before the 
North Korean situation flared up. 
  Defense officials refused to confirm the report about a 
strengthening of U.S. Forces in South Korea, reminding that 
American military strategy remains secret until a firm decision 
has been made. 
  The seeming difference of opinion in Washington is probably 
a 
two-pronged approach carefully planned by U.S. officials. 
  The Clinton administration is in search of a new impetus 
that 
can put the ball in a different court without the present 
tension. 
  While high-level officials talk of a military threat, 
mid-level officials speak differently. This is probably 
Washington's way of waving both the stick and the carrot.

  [Text] The North Korean ambassador to China warned today 
that if the United States does not suspend pressuring North 
Korea, the Korean peninsula will be submerged in war once again. 
  North Korean Ambassador Chu Chang-chun made this remark at a 
news conference on 23 March and threatened that the United 
States should not forget their lesson learned from the Korea war 
on 25 June. He denounced the U.S. Clinton administration for 
attempting to create international pressure against North Korea. 
  Ambassador Chu said that such an act by the United States 
will contribute to only hastening the war and stressed that if 
the United States does not immediately give up its attempt, 
there will be only a war. 
  The Korean Central News Agency monitored in Tokyo reported 
that North Korea is fully prepared to answer dialogue with 
dialogue and war with war. Prior to this report, Pyongyang 
radio monitored in Tokyo warned that North Korea is 
simultaneously preparing for both dialogue and war. It also 
denounced the United States for continuing to stifle North Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, March 23 (YONHAP) -- An official from the 
Chinese Communist Party stressed Wednesday that South and North 
Korea should continue dialogue to solve the nuclear issue 
despite the rupture in their bilateral working-level talks last 
week. 
  The deputy head of the International Liaison Department of 
the Chinese Communist Party, Zhu Shanqing, told YONHAP in an 
interview: "China abstained from voting when the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) passed a resolution on North Korea 
and this is China's latest position. But the North Korean 
nuclear problem should be resolved by continuous dialogue 
between South and North Korea, and between the IAEA and North 
Korea." 
  Zhu, who arrived here on March 16 at the invitation of the 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party, appeared to be hinting that he 
opposes sanctions against Pyongyang. 
  Asked whether Chinese President Jiang Zemin will come to 
Seoul, he said, "Jiang will certainly visit Seoul. Since this 
is an important matter, Jiang and President Kim Yong-sam will 
consult on it when they meet in Beijing next week." 
  President Kim's visit to China will help strengthen 
bilateral 
ties remarkably, Zhu said, adding that the planned trip by DLP 
Secretary-General Mun Chong-su to Beijing will help improve 
relations and mutual understanding between the DLP and the 
Chinese Communist Party. 
  "This visit to Seoul was very helpful and I found many 
common 
aspects in politics, economics and culture between the two 
countries," he said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 23 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
was reported in Tokyo and Beijing Wednesday as having said that 
he hopes to hold in-depth discussions on the North Korean 
nuclear problem with the leaders of Japan and China during his 
official visits to the two countries. 
  Kim also said South Korea would support any decision reached 
by the United Nations Security Council on North Korea. 
  Kim made the remarks at a press conference Tuesday for 
Japanese and Chinese correspondents stationed in Seoul as he 
prepared for the visits beginning Thursday. 
  The president noted that the North Korean nuclear issue is 
important to Japan, and that China supported denuclearization of 
the Korean peninsula. 
  Kim stressed that the opinions of the three countries are 
basically identical, both Japanese and Chinese press reported 
Wednesday. 
  China's XINHUA news agency quoted Kim as saying he hoped 
that 
his visits to the two countries would serve as a turning point 
in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and in realizing 
peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and unification of 
Korea. 
  Turning to threats by the chief North Korean delegate to the 
inter-Korean contact last Saturday that Seoul will turn into a 
sea of fire if war breaks out, Kim said any North Korean 
provocation would be headed off as South Korea is strong and the 
Seoul-Washington security system is flawless. 
  The president pointed out that North Korea first proposed an 
exchange of special envoys. However, it may not happen any time 
soon as Pyongyang has set various conditions, Kim said. 
  When the North Koreans walked out of the inter-Korean 
working-level contact last Saturday, the rupture was intentional 
since their chief delegate read a statement from a prepared 
text, Kim told interviewers. 
  Aside from the nuclear issue, Kim said economic cooperation 
and development of trade ties between Seoul and Tokyo and Seoul 
and Beijing will top the agenda during his visits. 
  In particular, Kim said he hoped economic relations with 
China will develop further as a result of his Beijing visit, 
noting that the two countries are already conducting exchanges 
in every field. 
  The president said he is convinced that Seoul-Beijing 
cooperation will contribute greatly to the peace and stability 
of the Northeast Asian region. 
  With regard to Japanese Emperor Akihito coming to Seoul, Kim 
said this would occur when mutual understanding deepened and the 
Korean and Japanese people accepted it. Kim thus hinted that 
Akihito could visit Seoul during his term in office.

  [Text] Seoul, March 23 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
embarks on state visits to Japan and China Thursday [24 March] 
to hold summits on bilateral and regional issues and seek 
cooperation in resolving the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  He will be in Tokyo from Thursday to Saturday, meeting 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for private and 
expanded summits. He stops in Shanghai on Saturday and arrives 
in Beijing on Sunday. His schedule there includes talks with 
President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng. 
  Building economic links was to top the agenda until last 
week, when North Korea's nuclear program created an 
unanticipated crisis. 
  The U.N. Security Council is poised to adopt a resolution on 
Pyongyang early next week, and securing Beijing's tacit approval 
is a must before the international community can take unified 
action. 
  Kim and his wife will call on Japanese Emperor Akihito on 
the 
afternoon of his arrival and then have a private summit with 
Hosokawa. 
  The two leaders will look at ways to build forward-looking 
relations after agreeing last summer to close the book on a past 
stained by Japanese colonial rule over Korea from 1910-45. 
  The South Korean president addresses the Japanese Diet on 
Friday and is to receive an honorary doctorate from Waseda 
University. 
  He meets Hosokawa again on Saturday before leaving for 
Shanghai, this time accompanied by his cabinet ministers. 
  In Shanghai, Kim will tour the complex that used to house 
the 
Korean Government-in-exile during the Japanese colonial years. 
  He starts his Beijing itinerary Monday morning in a summit 
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, where he will likely ask 
Beijing to intervene in the North Korean nuclear standoff. 
  Kim will also address bilateral trade issues at the summit. 
  He plans to speak at Beijing University on new Seoul-Beijing 
relations and tour South Korea's exclusive industrial complex in 
Tianjin before returning home on March 30.

  [Text] Seoul, March 23 (YONHAP) -- Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae said Wednesday that the South Korean and U.S. 
Governments are discussing when to resume the Team Spirit 
military exercise, which will include Patriot missiles. 
  Yi told the National Assembly's National Defense Committee 
that the exercise may begin in late April, mid-May or sometime 
after that. 
  He said, "as North Korea failed to fulfill the two 
preconditions for suspension of Team Spirit, resumption of the 
exercise has become inevitable. The maximum number of U.S. 
Forces possible will take part in the exercise for maximum 
effect." 
  He explained that Team Spirit will include command post 
exercises and such practical maneuvers as river crossings and 
emergency landings. 
  North Korea walked out of the latest inter-Korean 
working-level contact on Saturday, rupturing the dialogue on 
exchanging special envoys, and warned Monday that it would 
withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) if Team 
Spirit was resumed this year. 
  In response to threats by Pyongyang, South Korea and the 
United States plan to deploy Patriot missiles near Seoul soon in 
preparation for an emergency. 
  The Patriots are expected to arrive here next month in time 
for Team Spirit. 
  Yi said, "Patriot anti-missile missiles will also be part of 
the exercise. One Patriot battalion can fight 55 incoming 
aircraft simultaneously and has the incidental capability of 
intercepting Scud missiles." 
  The government will decide the date for resumption of Team 
Spirit after considering the effect on farmers and likely 
outcome of the joint exercise. 
  "Once the government officially announces the resumption of 
Team Spirit, it will be difficult to suspend the exercise 
again," he said. 
  He did not rule out the possibility of North Korean 
provocation after the United Nations discusses possible economic 
sanctions. 
  "The government is working out countermeasures of two kinds 
-- one before the U.N. Security Council decides on sanctions 
against North Korea and the other after the decision," he said. 
  Yi said Seoul and Washington will hold consultations after 
the Security Council makes a decision on sanctions. 
  If sanctions are imposed, he said North Korea may try to 
endure the pressure but would eventually be compelled to accede 
to the council's demands. 
  "But if Pyongyang judges the United Nations' deterrent power 
is not enough to defeat it, you cannot rule out that possibility 
and it may choose military provocation," he said.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles in Seoul vernacular newspapers published on 23 March 
reacting to the U.S. and ROK decision to deploy Patriots 
missiles to the ROK. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 3 carries a 900-word 
article by Washington-based correspondent Yi Chong-yon entitled: 
"The Background Behind the U.S. Decision To Deploy Patriots." 
The article notes that in the wake of the rupture of 
North-South contacts, the U.S. policy toward North Korea has 
shifted from "diplomatic negotiations" to "exercising pressure" 
and reports "the deployment of Patriots has brought up 
speculation that the United States will impose gradual pressure 
on North Korea by demonstrating its power." The article notes: 
"The deployment of Patriots is apparently aimed at grasping the 
initiative on the nuclear issue, rather than giving up dialogue 
with North Korea." 
  While noting that the United States is assuming a 
two-pronged 
stance toward North Korea -- demonstrating power while taking a 
cautious approach on North Korea -- the article reports the 
diplomatic goal of the United States is "not isolating North 
Korea from the international community, but inducing it to join 
in the international nuclear order." The article notes that 
the United States is not giving up its efforts for dialogue 
since it estimates that a UN resolution will have little effect 
on North Korea and that it is not in the interest of the United 
States to heighten the tension on the Korean peninsula. The 
article predicts "chances are high that the North Korean nuclear 
issue will be back on the negotiating table after a cooling-off 
period." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO on page 3 carries a 900-word 
article 
by Washington-based correspondent Yi Sang-sok entitled: "The 
United States is Taking a Cautious Approach on North Korea." 
The article writes: "It is ironic that the U.S. decision on 
the Patriots has a diplomatic meaning rather than a military 
one." Reporting that the Patriots will take more than a month 
to reach the ROK, the article notes "that leaves plenty of time 
for the U.S. Government to try diplomatic persuasion to pry open 
North Korea's nuclear facilities for international inspection. 
This shows that the United States wants to go the extra mile 
with diplomacy before considering military steps on the North." 
  Recalling that the U.S. Government announced its plan on the 
deployment earlier than expected, the article interprets this 
move as "U.S. efforts to maximize its firm stance on the North 
Korean nuclear issue by coordinating the timing with the UN 
Security Council's discussions on the issue." The article 
concludes: "The United States will not give up its efforts to 
peacefully resolve the nuclear issue." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN on page 2 carries a 
700-word 
article by O Tae-kyu from the "Fluoroscope" column. The article 
recalls the past commitments made by high-level ROK Government 
officials that they will not bring in the Patriots and then 
expresses regret that "with the North Korean chief delegate's 
remark on turning Seoul into a fireball, the deployment of 
Patriots has become a resolute issue inside the government." 
The article points out the deployment is "a by-product of a 
shrewd trick of U.S. arms dealers who are making the most of the 
current tense situation." Noting that the issue on deploying the 
Patriots was not included in the North Korean-U.S. agreement 
reached in New York, the article writes: "The U.S. and ROK 
Governments, however, decided to deploy the Patriots missiles as 
soon as the North-South contact ruptured, giving an impression 
that they were hoping for it," and maintains that an "immediate 
decision on the deployment, which was made under the pretext of 
the rupture of North-South contact, is a jump of logic." The 
article urges the government to clearly manifest the background 
behind such a decision to allay the people's suspicion on the 
deployment.

  [Text] A new government building in which to hold 
South-North talks will be built in Ilsan, Kyonggi Province in 
preparation for full-fledged South-North negotiations. 
  In addition, large-scale construction of public projects -- 
such as a new airport based in the southwestern area of the 
country, an international exhibition hall in Taegu Airport, a 
direct Kyongju-Chonju railway, a new port in Yongil Straits of 
Pohang, and new state bypasses -- will begin on a full scale 
next year. At the same time, Kimpo Airport will be enlarged. 
  The International Vaccine Institute of the Seoul National 
University and a management organization for practicing 
employment insurance system will also be established next year. 
  The Economic Planning Board's report "Status of Major New 
and Ongoing Projects for 1995," reports that government offices 
are planning the above projects for next year. 
  According to this report, the National Unification Board 
plans to build a large government building in which to hold 
South-North dialogue in Ilsan with a total fund of 80.2 billion 
won in preparation for future activated South-North dialogue 
because the existing South-North dialogue office located in 
Samchong-tong, Seoul is too small and on lease. 
  The Ministry of Transportation will survey the propriety of 
building a new airport in the southwestern area with the people 
of Muan, South Cholla Province, where it will likely be built. 
Next year it will also begin full-scale construction of various 
public projects, including state bypasses, which will be 
completed by 2000 and for which a total fund of 6,509 billion 
won will be invested.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials from Seoul vernacular press published on 22 March on 
the rupture of North-South working-level contacts for the 
exchange of special envoys and remarks made by senior North 
Korean delegate at the 19 March contact. 
  The conservative daily CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 
1,200-word editorial entitled: "How Can They Threaten `War'?" 
Describing the "venomous remarks" made by the North Korean 
delegate during the eighth working-level contact that "Seoul is 
not far from here. If a war breaks out, Seoul will become a sea 
of fire and you cannot survive," as "shuddering," the editorial 
reports his remarks disclosed the "true color" of North Korea. 
The editorial expresses doubts that North Korea can hardly 
become a "dialogue partner" in peacefully resolving the nation's 
problems and that "no nation" in the international community 
"supports" the North Korean position. Stressing that the 
international community cannot have "perseverance" if North 
Korea persists in an "unreasonable policy" regarding North-South 
relations and the nuclear issue, the editorial notes that our 
side is "well aware" of North Korean capabilities and will take 
"resolute countermeasures" when North Korea commits an act of 
"disturbing" the peace of the world. The editorial urges the 
North to ponder "coolly" the consequences of its radical 
hard-line steps and to act with discretion. Otherwise, the 
"collapse" of the Kim Il-song system and "North Korean-style 
socialism" will be "expedited." 
  CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,300-word editorial 
entitled: "We Reprove the Government." Defining the incumbent 
government's policies on diplomacy, security, reunification, and 
North Korea as a "comprehensive failure," the editorial calls on 
the Kim Yong-sam government to keenly realize the current "very 
serious situation," and reports that the North side's 
"intentional mockery and threat" including the "Seoul in a sea 
of fire" remarks made by the North delegate at "official talks" 
are the result of the government's "easy-going" policy on North 
Korea, which has been implemented for the past one year. 
Stressing that the security issue is the greatest national 
issue, which will go into "bankruptcy" even by "one error," the 
paper urges the government to have "a sense of shame" for the 
recent "blow" dealt by North Korea. Describing the current 
events as a "grave situation," the editorial criticizes the Kim 
Yong-sam government's appointment of "gentlemen," who lack the 
sense of reality and "practical experience," to the posts of 
handling the North Korean issues and of dealing with North 
Korea's strategy of "hiding a bayonet behind a smile." 
Assessing the "security-related ministers' conference" as a 
meeting of those who failed in working out proper measures 
against North Korea by using up all their "cards," the paper 
strongly urges that the government should present "appropriate 
measures" instead of "prescriptions" made out after the patient 
has died. 
  The moderate daily HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 a 
1,300-word editorial entitled: "Full-Scale Preparations Should 
Be Made for Provocation." Noting that the people are worried 
about North Korea's provocative remarks on war, the editorial 
stresses that high-level officials in charge of diplomatic and 
security affairs should "closely examine" the reason the 
situation has "worsened." Pointing out that the "attitude" of 
the government's diplomatic, unification, and security teams 
toward the North made the people "worry," the editorial 
criticizes "the nation-first policy," "national welfare theory" 
and "incoherent" diplomacy against North Korea, which invariably 
seeks "communization" of the South. The editorial reports that 
"opposition" to deployment of Patriot missiles to U.S. Forces in 
the ROK, which was expressed by the government claiming that 
this would "incite" North Korea, and the policy of separating 
the North Korean nuclear issue from "economic cooperation," were 
the result of the government's "inconsistent" policy. Stressing 
that North Korean military power, sought even amid severe 
economic difficulties, is still "enormous," the paper introduces 
that "three mechanized corps and tanks corps and two artillery 
corps" have been deployed within 80 km from the Military 
Demarcation Line. 
  Noting it is important for the government to further 
strengthen its "security and defense posture" and for the people 
to heighten "vigilance" against North Korea, the paper urges the 
government not to assume a "wavering" attitude toward the North 
so the people will "trust" and "follow" the government. 
  The independent moderate daily MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN 
publishes 
on page 3 a 1,100-word editorial entitled: "Where is North 
Korea Heading?" Expressing concern with the North Korean side's 
"radical remarks" on "willingness for war" made during the 
working-level contact, the editorial points out that one cannot 
understand such remarks with "common sense" and that the North 
Korean authorities are likely attempting to "gain time" for 
nuclear development. Stressing that "strong countermeasures" are 
the only solution to the problem, the paper calls on the 
government to strengthen diplomatic efforts to maintain an 
"international cooperative system" in the course of dealing with 
the North Korean nuclear issue and to prevent the situation from 
advancing to an "extreme phase." The editorial maintains that a 
"tight defensive system" should be established to cope with the 
"reckless challenge" by North Korea. 
  The pro-government daily SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 
2,300-word editorial, under the headline, "We Should Resolutely 
Respond to the Threat on `Sea of Fire'." Saying that an 
"extremely serious situation" has developed following the North 
Korean delegate's remarks at the North-South contact, the 
editorial urges a reexamination of our own "internal posture" to 
cope with this situation. Assessing the purpose of North 
Korea's expression of a willingness for war as part of its 
"negotiation strategy" to strengthen its own system of rule, to 
provoke our "sense of anxiety" and create confusion within our 
society, and to "alienate" the ROK, Japan, and the United States 
in the "international arena," the paper observes that the 
North's actions might have been prompted by our own "weak 
points" such as the slackening of security since the 
inauguration of the civilian government. Urging the government 
to reexamine the nation's overall security posture, the 
editorial particularly urges leading figures in society to 
encourage the people to "establish" a new outlook on the 
nation's security. Stressing that war can be prevented only by 
"advance preparations," the paper calls for strengthening 
internal unity to cope against any provocation. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 
1,200-word editorial entitled, "We Are Concerned With the 
Nation's Security." Noting that, regardless of North or South, 
all will be reduced to ashes if a war breaks out on the Korean 
peninsula, the editorial expresses "shock" at the North Korean 
delegate's remarks on Seoul becoming "a sea of fire," and points 
out that North Korea cannot evade the international community's 
"spearhead of attack." The paper, however, asks whether we are 
"willing and capable" of coping with such "unpredictable acts" 
of North Korea and whether we have enough arms to do so. The 
paper criticizes our diplomatic team as "too weak" to dissipate 
the uneasiness of the people, and as being "naive" and lacking 
in clear, firm principles. 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 
1,300-word editorial under the headline, "Catastrophe in 
North-South Dialogue Should Be Avoided." Noting that hasty and 
narrow-minded people are worried about the possibility of war, 
the editorial writes that the South's "acute reaction" to the 
North's "bombshell declaration" on a readiness to answer 
dialogue for dialogue and war with war was responsible for the 
rupture in North-South talks. The paper then points out that 
the nation's "future" was now more likely to be a target of 
"bargaining" between big powers. 
  Opposing an "extreme attitude" against North Korea as 
ineffective due to the likelihood of North Korea's further 
aggravating military tension in order to appease a public 
sentiment that will arise following economic sanctions. The 
paper implores the North and the South to agree to a 
working-level contact over the telephone as soon as possible and 
to resolve this problem through dialogue and discussion, as they 
would a "matrimonial quarrel."

  [Text] According to the Ministry of National Defense [MND] 
and the field army on 22 March, North Korean loudspeaker 
announcements heard on the South's east and midwest frontlines 
near the DMZ have begun calling Kim Chong-il "president 
[chusok]" since early March instead of the usual "beloved and 
respected leader" or "supreme commander of the army." Noting 
that the change coincided with the resumption of dialogue, 
including the working-level contacts between the South and the 
North, relevant authorities including the MND are speculating 
that this may mean a change in system, including the complete 
transfer of North Korea's supreme power to Kim Chong-il, or a 
change in policy toward South Korea.

  [Text] The eighth working-level contact for the exchange 
of special envoys held at Panmunjom on 19 March may go down in 
records as talks that substantially regressed North-South 
relations. 
  "Are you declaring a war?" 
  "You declared a war first. Seoul is not far from here. If a 
war breaks out, Seoul will also be a sea of fire. Mr. Song, you 
will not be safe, either." 
  Dialogue held between Song Yong-tae, chief South Korean 
delegate and vice minister of the National Unification Board 
[NUB] and Pak Yong-su, chief North Korean delegate and deputy 
director of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the 
Fatherland, was aired nationwide that day on the nine-o'clock 
[12:00 GMT] evening news, and North-South relations now face a 
situation which is dominated not by issues of dialogue and 
negotiations, but by issues of confrontation and security that 
call for the deployment of Patriot missiles and warnings of 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. 
  Even though the image was blurred, the North Korean 
delegate's "extreme remarks" were conveyed vividly like a live 
broadcast, and can be viewed as a threat to the South. 
Attention is now focusing on why the contents, which might 
amplify people's fears, were allowed to be broadcast without any 
filtering. 
  Scenes of none of the seven contacts to date were reported. 
Only the greeting sessions prior to talks were open to 
reporters and photographers. While North Korea's remarks at the 
last contact were far more serious than its previous "threats," 
the government's release of footage of the talks to broadcasting 
stations was also exceptional, especially when considering that 
the talks were, as before, held in "closed session." 
  Heads of relevant departments, including the Vice Premier 
and 
NUB Minister and the Senior Presidential Secretary for foreign 
affairs and security, were able to watch the development of the 
talks even though the North-South contacts at Panmunjom were 
held in closed sessions, to allow for quick evaluation of 
developments in the talks, quick countermeasures, and provision 
of new guidelines in answer to the other side's position. 
  While only audio is available when talks are held at the 
North side's Tongilgak, both audio and video are available 
through closed-circuit television [CCTV] when talks are held in 
the South side's Peace House. Furthermore, it has been learned 
that CCTVs are installed at Chongwadae [presidential office], 
the Secretariat for North-South talks, and the Agency for 
National Security Planning, so policymakers monitoring the talks 
on the CCTVs, clearly heard the North Korean delegate Pak 
Yong-su's remarks of "Seoul sea of fire," as the eighth contact 
happened to take place at the Peace House. 
  Details of how the government came to the decision to 
release 
the contents on video tapes to broadcast stations are unknown. 
It did not take the government very long, however, to decide to 
"vividly" convey the remarks in question to the people. Around 
2 PM [05:00 GMT] that day, less than three hours after the talks 
had ended, the NUB asked broadcast station reporters who were 
covering the day's talks if there were any technical problems in 
airing footage recorded from the CCTV and when their deadlines 
were. In answer to the question of whether this would violate 
the agreement between the South and the North to keep the talks 
closed, the NUB explained that North Korea had also made the 
contents of the talks public. This later turned out to be a 
poor excuse. It was 9:00 PM [12:00 GMT] in the evening the next 
day [20 March] when North Korea reported the eighth contact in 
detail through its CENTRAL BROADCAST. 
  Concerning this, an NUB official said: "The video tape was 
released to convey the fact to the people matter-of-factly that 
North Korea made such intimidating remarks." 
  After viewing the two-minute-and-forty-second tape, a 
broadcast station executive asked related departments, including 
the Chongwadae, for confirmation that the contents were allowed 
to be aired. The answer from the Chongwadae was: "We are aware 
of the fact." The announcement of the decision to deploy 
Patriot missiles, whose deployment was the subject of much 
controversy, was subsequently made during the security-related 
ministers' meeting on 21 March.

<F P=106> [Report by Ku Pon-yong] </F>
  [Text] North Korea is exerting all its efforts to increase 
the production of clothes for export in order to earn foreign 
currency, which it lacks, to solve its economic difficulties. 
  After the mid-1980's, North Korea began to build export 
clothes plants independent of plants for domestic consumption to 
earn foreign currency. There are an estimated 40 such plants, 
20 of which are joint ventures or jointly managed, mainly with 
companies owned by the General Association of Korean Residents 
in Japan, Chongnyon. 
  The export clothes companies import basic materials and 
export the finished products to Japan and Western countries. 
Those with outstanding export records are Moranbong 
joint-venture company, Nakwon Songhwa clothes company, and 
Chindallae joint-venture company (women's clothes). Moranbong 
joint-venture company, North Korea's largest export clothes 
company, exported approximately 280,000 men's suits and jackets 
in 1990. 
  There are reports, however, that North Korea's ambitious 
plans to expand clothes exports are partly snagged. Chongnyon 
businessmen are refraining from investing in North Korea due to 
the North Korean regime's excessive control and closed policy, 
which run counter to the changes in the international political 
situation. 
  It has been learned that since the beginning of the 
nineties, 
consecutive Chongnyon companies have gone bankrupt or stopped 
operations due to the North Korean authority's opportunistic and 
stubborn attitude and now only 20 plants are in operation. 
  As a result, the North Korean authorities are actively 
seeking joint-venture businesses with Western countries in the 
clothes processing sector. In the meantime, it is also expected 
that North Korea will show increased interest in expanding 
processing trade with the ROK, despite the blocked North-South 
relations. 
  However, ROK's processing trade is not expected to be 
activated until the North Korean nuclear issue reaches a stage 
of resolution.

  [Text] Local importers who have been distributing American 
sausage with illegally extended expiration dates by freezing 
them have been ordered to retrieve the products from 
distribution outlets and destroy them. 
  The Health-Social Affairs's stern action, however is feared 
to trigger trade friction with the United States which sent a 
senior official of the U.S. Trade Representative's Office to 
file a protest. 
  Peter Collins, assistant deputy U.S. Trade Representative, 
arrived here March 11 to lodge a formal protest with the 
ministry over its reluctance to allow the American products to 
go through customs in Pusan. 
  At the same time, the incident has all the appearance of 
turning into the discovery of major irregularities committed by 
government officials who are under investigation for possibly 
taking bribes from the importers. 
  At least 20 former and incumbent officials of the Pusan 
customs and quarantine office, and the National Institute of 
Health are facing a special audit by the ministry. 
  According to ministry officials, 24 importers of American 
sausage, mostly chicken and turkey franks, have been taking in 
shipments of frozen products since 1990 even though they should 
have been refrigerated instead. 
  Among the 24 companies are Kotco Co., Yongmi Trading Co., 
Sejung Industrial Co., Oksan International, Ambrose Deli House, 
E.A.C. Korea, Jinyong Food Co., Yonbang International and 
Myongjin I.C.I. 
  Under the Food Sanitation Law, frozen sausage has an 
expiration date of 90 days from the day of production whereas 
refrigerated products must be sold within 30 days, an official 
of the ministry's sanitation Safety Section said. 
  Realizing that it would be impossible to market the products 
here since the time required for shipment and customs clearance 
runs up to almost 30 days, the importers apparently resorted to 
freezing the products to buy more time. 
  "However, freezing the products for shipment then defrosting 
them in the process of distributing and getting them to 
consumers through department stores and supermarkets, can only 
result in the breeding of microorganisms, thus making them 
obviously hazardous to health," he explained. 
  The official admitted that the legal period for distribution 
varies from state to state with some providing longer periods, 
at least more than 30 days, it is a rule of thumb that the 
importing country's standards must be observed. 
  "We understand that while there are some frozen sausages in 
the United States, most of them are refrigerated since heat is 
applied on the products during processing," he noted. 
  Under related regulations, the heat-treated sausages are 
recommended to be refrigerated at between 0-10 degree centigrade 
depending on the ingredient and the processing methods. 
  The import of heat-treated sausages began in 1990 and an 
estimated 4,800 tons, estimated to be worth 19 billion won 
(approximately 25 million U.S. dollars), were shipped here, 
almost exclusively from the United States.

  [Text] Seoul, March 22 (YONHAP) -- The Mexican Government 
simplified procedures and paperwork for South Korean tourists 
and businessmen entering the country as of March 10, the Foreign 
Ministry said Tuesday. 
  As agreed at joint economic cooperation talks held last 
month, Mexico now requires that tourists submit a traveler's 
card available at tourism bureaus, airports and on planes 
instead of papers that previously had to be purchased at the 
Mexican mission in Seoul. 
  Businessmen who stay 90 days or less can enter Mexico 
without 
visas. 
  The measure is part of bilateral efforts to boost people 
exchanges and corporate activities, especially on Seoul's part, 
to build better relations with the member of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

  [Text] Seoul, March 23 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry has 
instructed the Navy to select a tactical command and fire 
control system for the next-generation Korean Destroyer (KDX), 
the Ministry announced on Wednesday. 
  The action is the first taken under the force improvement 
plan codenamed Yulgok, and it will set a precedent for other 
weapons system development programs under the scheme, Ministry 
officials said. 
  At a Yulgok Committee meeting last June, the Ministry 
tentatively decided to use the Cosys-200k1 system developed by 
Germany's Atlas Electronik Co. for the KDX. The decision was 
opposed by some, however, who maintained that a British system 
was better than the German one in terms of reliability and 
performance. 
  The German and British suppliers then offered to cut their 
prices, causing the Ministry to put off a final decision. 
  In view of the system's features, the KDX building process 
and to ensure the success of the KDX program, the Ministry 
recently decided to leave the decision up to the Navy, which 
will operate the system to meet its tactical requirements, an 
official said. 
  The Navy will select a system next month so that the KDX 
program can be completed by 1998 as scheduled, he added. 
  Under the KDX program, a state-of-the-art tactical command 
and fire control system will be developed at a cost of 151 
billion won (188 million U.S. dollars) for use in the KDX, the 
Navy's main warship in the 21st century.

Riddled With `Irrationalities' -- Officials Fixed How Much to

Hurried Planning"] 
  [Text] The Farm-Relief Special Tax implementation plans, 
released simultaneously on 21 January by the Ministry of Finance 
[MOF] and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries [MAF], show 
a striking contrast. 
  In a nutshell, the MOF release answers the question of "who 
should pay the new tax" in great details while the MAF 
announcement dealing with "what it will be spent on and how" is 
full of "abstracts and ambiguities." 
  This is not to say that the MOF has done a good job or that 
the MAF has made a blunder but that the plans clearly unveiled 
the procedural problems involved. In other words, even before 
arriving at a firm decision on future uses of the money from the 
taxation in the light of the fundamental purpose of the new tax, 
officials came up with numbers on the amount of collection, 
e.g., "15 trillion won [W] over 10 years." 
  Because of the "original sin" inherent in the tax, the 
principle of "measuring the need first, then tailoring the levy 
to it"--stated in the first chapter of the textbook on public 
finance--was ignored from the very beginning. 
  The MOF, which originally opposed the levying of the farm 
relief tax, an earmarked tax, evidently took great pains to find 
the revenue sources for it, which are not many to begin with, 
while the MAF, which gained an annual W500 billion revenue 
source as a result of the upheaval over the rice issue last 
year, apparently prepared "in haste" the list of uses for the 
money for honor's sake. 
  There is no denying that the rice issue was a big political 
burden--so big that it drew the president's apology [following 
the Uruguay Round settlement]. However, at a time when a water 
pollution incident would easily lead to discussion of an 
environmental protection tax, it is undoubtedly the taxpayer's 
position that the process of establishing the new earmarked tax 
and priorities involved should be put to a review before any 
further steps on it are taken. 
  In this connection, the MAF explains that it is just 
"prudent 
with options." 
  It maintains that it needs to find a consensus of farmers 
and 
fishermen and their interest groups on how they want the money 
to be spent, and that it will finalize its plan before the 
collection begins in July. 
  The explanations, however, cannot convince the public of how 
it came up with such a number as W1.5 trillion and why it is 
needed. 
  The government should not handle tax business in a "surprise 
show" style as it did when issuing the decree outlawing 
financial transactions using aliases or borrowed names. 
  A glance at the MOF-released "Plan for the Farm-Relief 
Special Tax" clearly indicates how difficult it is to collect 
W1.5 trillion in additional tax a year. The plan, covering six 
large branches, shows traces of a hard struggle to find revenue 
from the already limited sources. 
  It is known that the original MOF plan focused on sectors 
profiting from the marked opening under the Uruguay Round 
settlement and on absorbing the profits as tax to finance the 
relief program, but that it was turned down in the course of 
interministry consultations. 
  Specifically, it was pointed out that profits from farm 
imports at cheaper prices are already absorbed into the Farm 
Prices Stability Fund and used to finance support programs for 
farm and fishing communities, and that therefore, renaming the 
levy and collecting them as tax would only be tantamount to 
"moving the money from the husband's wallet to the wife's." 
  So, the MOF was compelled to look for revenue sources 
elsewhere. The result was "irrationalities" as seen everywhere 
in the announced plan. For example, the earlier tax cuts for 
technology development, plant and equipment investment and for 
savings incentive will be rescinded; the corporate tax will be 
increased at the risk of weakening competitiveness; the 
acquisition tax will be increased on houses and cars, even 
though it could mean contradicting the existing long-term tax 
reform plan designed to gradually reduce the net worth tax. 
  The unanimous hopes of the public for relief to the farm and 
fishing communities must not be reduced to a daydream. The 
important thing for the government to do right now is to try to 
come up with a blueprint both specific and future-oriented and 
showing how much money it intends to spend and on what, as soon 
as possible.

  The tax money thus collected will, according to the MAF 
plan, 
be used for: 
  --improving competitiveness in the rice markets, by 
readjusting farm land partitions to promote agricultural 
mechanization; providing large-type farm machines including 
tractors, sowers; setting up combined rice processing plants in 
areas where land readjustments have been carried out; giving 
financial support to management innovation efforts. 
  --improving competitiveness of basic farm produce, by 
creating high-tech complexes such as those of glass greenhouses, 
complexes exclusively for exports, and complexes exclusively for 
the processing of farm produce. 
  --training technical workers, by developing capabilities to 
utilize advanced technology and information; building special 
colleges of technology (a school in each province). 
  --developing advanced technologies, including direct sowing 
by aircraft, new breeding, cloning of Korean cattle, and 
low-pollution farming materials. 
  --developing farm and fishing villages, by creating tourist 
villages in mountains and fishing villages and marine products 
processing complexes; expanding and/or paving 50,000 kilometers 
of roads. 
  --promoting rural regional developments, by expanding 
agricultural-industrial complexes, public health and medical 
facilities; building public halls in towns and townships. 
  Meanwhile, the projected Farm-Relief Special Tax will, 
according to the MOF plan, be paid by: 
  --beneficiaries of the various tax cuts, who will be 
required 
to pay 20 percent of the cuts. But the levy will not be on every 
earlier tax cut but only on the cuts in the income and corporate 
taxes under the Regulation Law on Tax Reduction and Exemption 
[RLTRE], in tariffs under the RLTRE and the Customs Tariff Law, 
and in the acquisition, registration, property, and integrated 
land taxes under the RLTRE and the Local Tax Law. 
  Cuts in the income and corporate taxes under the RLTRE mean 
the special investment tax exemption for plant and equipment 
investments by businesses; the deduction allowed of the income 
from a capital increase when an enterprise has increased the 
capital to improve its financial structure, and the cut in the 
capital gain tax applied to cases of land expropriation by the 
state. Percent cuts in tariffs under the RLTRE and the Customs 
Tariff Law mean those applied to imports of ship and aircraft 
parts and automation equipment. 
  Local tax cuts under the Local Tax Law and RLTRE include tax 
exemption benefits for real estate acquired and retained by 
nonprofit organizations. 
  Excluded from the foregoing cuts under the RLTRE are those 
for state and local autonomous bodies, and for farmers and 
fishermen (such as the transfer tax benefits on farmer-owned 
land and the exemption granted farming cooperatives); tax 
benefits authorized by international conventions (such as 
exemptions for diplomats and tourists by international usage). 
  In the case of the transfer tax exemption under the 
one-family-one-house program or the deduction allowed in the 
earned income tax withholding from the monthly salaries, it is 
not under the RLTRE but the Income Tax Law;, therefore, it is 
excluded in principle from the new taxation. The exemption for 
houses below the "national house" in size is indeed under the 
RLTRE, but it involves neither an income tax nor a corporate tax 
but a value-added tax and, therefore, is also excluded. 
  --earners of interests on tax-free or tax-cut savings 
deposits. Currently, 18 types of savings deposits are either 
free of the interest income tax, which is 20 percent of the 
income (or 21.5 percent with the residential tax included) or 
subjected to a 5 percent tax rate. Under the plan, all these 
savings deposits are among the objects of the new tax. 
  The rate will be 2 percent on currently tax-free deposits 
(such as the Worker Long-Term Savings Deposit), while 
small-amount, family-type savings deposits, currently subject to 
a 5 percent tax rate, will be assessed an additional 1.5 
percent. Therefore, the current tax burden of 20 percent (or 
21.5 percent with the residential tax included), 5 percent and 0 
percent will respectively be changed to 21.5 percent, 6.5 
percent and 2 percent. However, the long-term savings deposits 
to prepare for the purchase of a house and the individual 
annuities--to which the government had decided to give tax 
benefits to induce long-term savings deposits--will not be taxed 
under the plan. 
  --others: 
  --sellers of securities, currently paying 0.2 percent of the 
proceeds from the sales in the securities transaction tax. They 
will be required to pay a separate 0.1 percent in the new tax. 
Therefore, the tax burden at the time of transaction will 
increase from 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent. 
  --corporate tax payers, currently paying 18 percent for the 
taxable amount less than 100 million won and 32 percent for that 
in excess of 100 million won, will be required to pay an 
additional 2 percent for the amount in excess of 100 million won 
in the new tax for two years, a time-limit measure. 
  --acquisitors of houses or cars, currently paying 2 percent 
of the acquisition cost in the acquisition tax, will be required 
to pay 10 percent of that payment (0.2 percent of the 
acquisition cost) in the Farm-Relief Special Tax. Houses smaller 
than the "national house" in size will be exempted from the new 
taxation, however. 
  --those who buy parimutuel tickets, currency paying 10 
percent of the ticket price in parimutuel tax and 2 percent in 
education tax, will under the plan be required to pay another 2 
percent in the new tax, and the total tax burden will be 14 
percent.

  [Text] Seoul, March 23 (YONHAP) -- The Communications 
Ministry announced Wednesday a comprehensive plan to build an 
ultra-high-speed information network, aimed at placing the 
multi-media information industry in the second-tier group after 
the United States and Japan by the year 2015. 
  The Ministry will form a pan-governmental promotion 
committee, a working-level committee and a planning and 
management team to implement the scheme. 
  The prime minister will be appointed as chairman of the 
pan-governmental promotion committee and the Economic Planning 
Board minister as vice chairman. 
  Another 23 figures from the presidential secretariat, prime 
minister's office and private companies are to participate in 
the committee. 
  The vice communications minister will be named chairman of 
the working-level committee and 24 director-general-level 
officials from other ministries will join the panel. 
  The new planning and management team will be set up within 
the Communications Ministry as a separate organ and in order to 
secure enough funds, an independent management foundation is to 
be formed. 
  The plan is due to be approved by the cabinet late this 
month 
or in early April. 
  It will be carried out in three stages at a cost of 44.77 
trillion won (55.47 U.S. billion dollars).

<F P=106> [By Siti Rahil] </F>
  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 23 KYODO -- A high-powered 
nongovernmental Asia-Pacific economic group has voiced concern 
about some countries linking trade and investment to human 
rights and democracy in a statement to be issued at the end of a 
three-day conference here on Thursday [24 March]. 
  A copy of the finalized draft statement of the Pacific 
Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) obtained by KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE on Wednesday said no region should be stopped from 
forming its own economic group as long as it is not 
protectionist. 
  "PECC expresses concern about the tendencies of some member 
economies to condition trade and investment on achievement of 
political or ideological objectives," said the statement, to be 
officially released at the end of PECC's 10th assembly. 
Delegates said this is an implicit reference to the tendency of 
some Western powers, such as the United States, to pressure 
Asian nations into adopting Western standards of human rights 
and democracy by threatening trade sanctions. 
  Called the "Kuala Lumpur Concord on Open Regionalism," the 
statement, which will be signed by representatives of each of 
the 21 member economies of the PECC, also stressed "the rights 
of all regions to organize in nondiscriminatory groupings, 
whether this be in the northern, southern, eastern or western 
Pacific." Delegates said this phrase apparently alludes to 
Western opposition toward the East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC), 
which is being planned by the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN). 
  The PECC statement was pushed by Malaysia, which wants to 
use 
the opportunity as host country of the current meeting to rap 
the United States for trying to institutionalize Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) when it hosted the first APEC 
informal leaders' meeting in Seattle last November. The meeting 
was boycotted by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, who 
strongly opposes the institutionalization of APEC. 
  "The danger to a Pacific community, to the Pacific age, to 
our common future, can come from many directions," the statement 
warned. 
  While "the end of the Cold War has clearly contributed to 
the 
making of a wider Pacific community...excessive domestic 
preoccupation can put a brake on the Pacific movement," it said. 
"A diversion of commitment to narrow regional interests and 
pursuits can be a serious detour from a path to which some might 
never return." 
  It pledged to establish measures to study and monitor the 
development of protectionism and liberalization in the Pacific 
and elsewhere and "ensure that any subregional grouping 
contributes to open regionalism and to lowering the barriers to 
nonmember economies." 
  PECC, whose members include ASEAN, the United States, Japan 
and some Latin American countries, is a nongovernmental 
organization that allows eminent thinkers, business leaders and 
government officials to meet every 18 months for spontaneous 
discussions on ways to promote economic cooperation in the 
region. 
  Started in 1980, the PECC paved the way for the formation of 
the governmental APEC forum in 1989 and advises governments in 
the region on matters of economic cooperation.

  [Text] The LAO DONG newspaper reports that the Government 
Office issued an official correspondence on 15 March dealing 
with the illegal import of cars in Dong Nai, Song Be, and Tay 
Ninh Provinces. 
  In the correspondence, the prime minister requests the 
people's committee chairmen of these provinces to solemnly 
review the low tax rates and the imposition of light fines for 
the large quantity of cars illegally imported through their 
local land borders. At the same time, they must clearly define 
the causes and responsibility of involved organs and individuals 
before taking disciplinary actions against the offenders. The 
chairmen must directly report their findings to the prime 
minister. 
  The prime minister also reminds the people's committee 
chairmen of provinces and cities directly subordinate to the 
central government -- except the three aforementioned provinces 
-- to conduct checks in their localities for similar cases and 
to report them to him with suggestions on how to deal with the 
cases. He also clearly requests that all provinces must 
complete their report in March 1994. 
  The same newspaper reports that in 1992-93, the provinces of 
Tay Ninh, Song Be, and Dong Nai legalized 789 illegally imported 
cars, which caused an influx of cars from Cambodia through the 
southwest border. This created confusion for border control and 
car registration authorities, causing a loss of 50.627 billion 
dong for the national budget. 
  It is noteworthy that before the issuance of the Directive 
No. 01 TTG, these three provinces registered to legalize 328 
illegally imported cars. After the introduction of the 
directive, they did not seize those cars as directed by the 
government instruction but continued to legalize an even larger 
quantity, 631, of illegally imported cars.

  [Text] Recently, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet held a working 
session with the Central Steering Committee for Debt Solvency 
[CSCDS]. After listening to reports on the second stage of the 
debt solvency and opinions from the Finance Ministry, the 
Vietnam State Bank, the State Planning Commission, the Interior 
Ministry, the Supreme People's Organ of Control, the State 
Economic Arbitrators, and the State Finance and Monetary 
Council, the prime minister concluded as follows: 
  The second stage of the debt solvency is a burdensome and 
very complicated issue. If it is not satisfactorily settled and 
quickly accomplished, its bad effects will be multiple. 
Therefore, the second stage of the debt solvency must be 
urgently conducted, solved, and basically concluded in 1994. 
  In executing the second stage of the debt solvency, the 
government has mobilized a moderately large force of cadres. 
However, after more than one year, the task has still not been 
concluded. This is partly due to the complicated and difficult 
characteristics of the second stage. But on the other side, it 
is also due to the lack of regular checks, encouragement, and 
guidance from different organs from the central to local levels, 
including the Standing Central Steering Committee for Debt 
Solvency. They still wait for the government to solve the bad 
debts. This is a great shortcoming of leaders of all echelons 
and levels. Therefore, it is necessary to solemnly review this 
responsibility. 
  In executing the second stage, the Standing Central Steering 
Committee for Debt Solvency must coordinate with related 
ministries and sectors to compile the necessary legal documents 
before presentation to the government for issuance to create a 
basis for the debt solvency committees at all levels to carry on 
their work. These documents must cover thoroughly all 
requirements and working principles. 
  All objective and subjective causes of bad debts must be 
considered carefully in line with the related structure and 
policies in effect when the debts were raised. At the same 
time, we must be very strict in cases where violations have been 
intentionally committed or committed due to irresponsibility. 
  We must classify each debt group for suitable measures. 
Debts among active state-run enterprises must be solved 
quickly, with proper attention paid to index adjustment and loan 
interests. We can provide some capital to create conditions for 
the debt settlement. Loans between active state-run enterprises 
with inactive or dissolved state-run enterprises, other 
organizations, and individuals must be separately listed before 
applying resolute and final measures with clear instructions to 
reclaim the money or settle the debts with assets, capital, 
land, or goods. In these cases, we must establish the 
responsibility of each sector, level, and individual, including 
administrative measures and legal proceedings against incumbent 
officials. 
  After that, debts will continue to be collected. The rest of 
the debt which is unable to be collected will be considered for 
subsidy from the government. While doing this, the 
responsibility of every sector and echelon must be clearly 
established to restore order and discipline in the state 
mechanism and purify the contingent of cadres, especially the 
cadres who manage the state finance and assets. 
  In dealing with debt solvency, the responsibilities of both 
sides must be established. Causes for prolonged debt must be 
defined by the debtors and favorable conditions must be actively 
created so that the debtors can repay their debts. Reasons from 
both sides, debtors and creditors, must be established for 
better dealing. 
  In the implementation process, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
stressed the organization management of the debt solvency 
committees at all levels. If necessary, their power must be 
increased so that they can work better with other sectors and 
echelons. The number of specialized cadres sent to the standing 
debt solvency groups must be reviewed. A necessary number of 
cadres must be retained to carry on the work. After receiving 
instructions from the cabinet, the CSCDS will hold meetings with 
10 provinces with acute problems in their debt solvency and with 
some key ministries and departments to execute the second stage 
of the debt solvency.

<F P=106> [Interview with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor by </F>
unidentified NHK reporter at his office in Washington on 21 
March; from "NHK News" Program; Kantor's comments are in English 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] In an interview with an NHK reporter on 21 March, 
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor stressed that the 
resumption of Japan-U.S. framework talks would be possible 
depending on the package of measures the Japanese Government 
planned to map out in late March to open its markets. 
  [Begin Kantor recording] We hope that it is aggressive and 
bold, in that there will be a good enough package to restart 
talks under the framework. What I want to talk about is Japan's 
having a bold package of market-opening items that will help us 
reengage this process. [end recording] 
  In this way, Mr. Kantor stressed that the resumption of 
Japan-U.S. framework talks is possible depending on the package 
of measures the Japanese Government plans to map out in late 
March to open its markets. 
  [Begin Kantor recording] I think it should not escape our 
attention that the Japanese market is the most closed market of 
any developed country in the world. [end recording] 
  Mr. Kantor's remarks emphasized that the United States will 
continue to use sanctions as a weapon to press Japan to open its 
market. The U.S. Trade Representative plans to release an 
annual report on foreign trade barriers in late March which 
could be used as evidence in the decision to invoke the Super 
301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act against Japan's 
foreign trade barriers. 
  Commenting on the release of the report, Mr. Kantor said the 
United States wants to speedily resolve procurement by the 
Japanese Government and the automobile sector. In the interview 
he suggested that the two sectors might be singled out in the 
report as examples of closed Japanese markets in the report.

  [Excerpts] Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, chairman of the Work 
Committee for Development of Border Regions and National Races 
and secretary-1 of the State Law and Order Restoration Council 
[SLORC], ministers and their entourage who had been visiting 
Mandalay left in a military plane on 21 March afternoon and 
arrived in Myitkyina, Kachin State, at 1420. Lt. Gen. Khin 
Nyunt and his entourage were accompanied by Major General Aye 
Kyaw, chairman of Northern Shan State Law and Order Restoration 
Council and commander. [passage omitted] 
  Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt and his entourage then proceeded to the 
Northern Military Command Headquarters where he met with KIO 
[Kachin Independence Organization] leaders U Lumung Tu Jai, U 
Gawri Zau Saing, Dr. La Ja, U Zau Phan, and U Hkun Maw. They 
discussed regional development projects in Kachin State. 
[passage omitted] 
  Speaking at the meeting, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt recalled that 
when he made the peace overture, he explained that as long as 
there is armed conflict within the state, development would fall 
behind. But, when armed conflict ended and peace prevailed, the 
government would work hand in hand with local people to 
accelerate development in Kachin State. Responding to this 
overture, the KIO, which understood the goodwill of the 
government, returned to the legal fold and the whole of Kachin 
State has now become peaceful. He said we therefore have to 
strive for more development projects in the state. 
  He said not only people in Kachin State, but everyone in 
Myanmar [Burma] is happy to have peace there. He said the 
general public have praised and acknowledged the cooperation 
between the government and the KIO based on mutual 
understanding. He said if the remaining armed organizations in 
the jungles make similar efforts, the people can expect and wish 
for peace and development for the entire Union. He said these 
expectations and wishes should be recognized. 
  Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that SLORC has prioritized 
development projects in the states depending on the annual state 
budget. He said it has been learned that the commander and the 
KIO had made preliminary coordination on the implementation of 
development projects in Kachin State. He said he and the 
ministers and departmental authorities had come here in order to 
provide the necessary assistance to implement these priority 
projects. He said good roads and communications, education, and 
health, and economic development are crucial to a region's 
development. He explained that agriculture and livestock 
breeding and dam and irrigation projects are crucial for 
economic development. 
  He added that Kachin State has many beautiful scenary. He 
cited the Myitson [confluence of Mae Hka and Mali Kha Rivers and 
the source of the Irrawaddy River] area and Indawgyi, which 
could be turned into international tourist spots to contribute 
to regional development. He said efforts should be made to 
develop small-scale private industries and that the government 
and the people are already cooperating in developing 
hydroelectric power projects to provide energy for these 
industries. He then called for discussions on the 
implementation of priority projects to enable the accelerated 
development of Kachin State and the people to enjoy the fruits 
of peace as quickly as possible. 
  Next, Kachin national leader, U Lumung Tu Jai spoke on the 
construction of new roads and bridges, the renovation of old 
roads and bridges, the location and development of sources of 
hydroelectric power, the expanded cultivation of sugarcane, the 
construction of dams, the development of new land, and the 
organization and education of local people to promote public 
participation. 
  Next, Commander Maj. Gen. Saw Lwin spoke on the construction 
and the renovation of Myitkyina-Shwe Road, Bhamo-Myitkyina Road, 
Putao-Myitkyina Road, Myitkyina-Tanai-Lido Road, 
Mogaung-Kamaing-Hpakan Road, Hopong-Mong Tawng Road, the 
construction and renovation of bridges, the resettlement of 
destroyed villagers, education, health, the expansion of 
hydroelectric power plants, and the provision of sugarcane for 
the Namti sugar mill. Next, the ministers, chairman of the 
Northern Shan State Law and Order Restoration Council, and 
departmental officials gave an explanation on development 
projects for border regions and national races in Kachin State. 
This included health; education; transport; the construction of 
a television relay station; the construction, renovation, and 
the expansion of roads and bridges; post, telegraph and 
telephone; agriculture and irrigation; and livestock breeding 
projects. 
  Next, in response to the discussion at the meeting, Lt. Gen. 
Khin Nyunt noted that ministers and departmental officials had 
explained the assistance programs based on the submissions of 
the national leaders for development of Kachin State. [passage 
omitted] He said based on the discussions today, efforts will 
be made for accelerated development of roads and communications, 
education, health, hydroelectric power, transportation, 
agriclture, and livestock breeding. He then urged the local 
people to join in helping the efforts of departmental 
authorities and the KIO. [passage omitted] 
  The secretary-1 and his entourage returned to Yangon 
[Rangoon] from Myitkyina this evening.

  [Text] Singapore, March 23 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The ASEAN 
Regional Forum (ARF) inaugural meeting should emphasize common 
areas instead of bringing in contentious issues, Malaysian 
Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi said Tuesday. 
  Highlighting the issues right from the start might not be 
good as it could relate to the position of a particular country, 
he added. 
  The country may ask why should it attend the meeting if it 
were to be the subject of criticism ... Then it might lose 
interest, he told a press conference at the end of a two-day 
official visit to Singapore. 
  The 18-member ARF created during the ASEAN ministerial 
meeting (AMM) here last year is scheduled to hold its first 
session in Bangkok in July. 
  It is made up of ASEAN, its dialogue partners, and regional 
powers. 
  I think the first forum should give opportunities for 
general 
discussion on the subject of confidence-building measures, said 
Abdullah who was here at the invitation of his Singapore 
counterpart, Prof. S. Jayakumar. 
  But, certainly, we wouldn't want to stop anybody from 
raising 
questions which may be sensitive, he added, saying he did not 
rule out the probability. 
  He said he did not think there would be difficulty in 
handling such issues because this is not going to be a meeting 
of strangers. 
  Abdullah said the ARF was an important forum and, naturally, 
Malaysia wanted it to succeed.

  [Text] Phnom Veng, Cambodia, March 22 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge 
fighters launched a lightning attack against government forces 
in northwest Cambodia Tuesday only two days after losing their 
last bastion, sources said. 
  In a dawn assault, about 150 members of the notorious ultra- 
nationalist faction attacked government positions in the Bavel 
district of Battambang Province, northeast of the former Khmer 
Rouge stronghold of Pailin, local police said. 
  The guerrillas attacked around 5:30 a.m., injuring two 
police 
officers, two local militia and six soldiers, one of them 
seriously, an officer said. 
  The Khmer Rouge also targeted a weapons warehouse and burned 
it down, he said, adding that two guerrillas were killed before 
government forces repelled the assault four hours. 
  "Because we destroyed their nest in Pailin, they have lost 
their temper and they just go everywhere in the area to try and 
disturb us, rob the villagers and burn peoples' homes," the 
police officer said. 
  In Thmar Kol, about halfway between Battambang and Sisophon, 
soldiers opened fire with heavy machine guns and artillery at 
what they said was an advancing force of Khmer Rouge. 
  More guerrilla attacks were expected late Tuesday night, and 
aid agencies were put on a security alert and warned not go to 
Bavel district. 
  Cambodian government forces say they seized Pailin, once a 
bustling gem-mining and logging centre, this weekend. 
  Trucks, heavy guns and multiple-rocket launchers were rushed 
to reinforce the town on Tuesday, but got bogged down in thick 
mud and heavy rain on Highway 10, a strategic route that has 
also yet to be cleared of suspected landmines, an AFP reporter 
saw. 
  Tuesday's attack came only a day after a senior government 
general said that the Khmer Rouge's estimated 1,500 fighters in 
the area had probably broken up into small groups. 
  Around 25,000 Cambodians have fled into eastern Thailand to 
escape the fighting, an armed forces spokesman in Bangkok said 
Monday.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the spokesman of the Committee for the </F>
Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in Pyongyang on 22 
March] 
  [Text] The spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful 
Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] issued the following 
statement denouncing the South Korean authorities for moving 
toward confrontation and war, totally blocking the exchange of 
top-level special envoys and dialogue between the North and the 
South. 
  Statement by the spokesman of the CPRF: 
  Currently, the South Korean authorities are moving toward 
the 
road of confrontation and war by totally blocking the exchange 
of top-level special envoys and dialogue between the North and 
the South. 
  As is already known, at the threshold the eighth 
working-level delegates contact for the exchange of special 
envoys held on 19 March, at a high-level strategic meeting, the 
South Korean authorities talked about some kind of strong 
measure and babbled about the resumption of the Team Spirit 
nuclear war exercise, bringing in Patriot missiles, and taking 
part in international sanctions. Such provocative action by the 
South Korean authorities already predicted the destiny of the 
exchange of special envoys and the harassment of peace. Today's 
situation has taken that course. 
  At the 19 March working-level delegates contact, the South 
side took a position of virtually declaring separation from us, 
thus bringing the working-level delegates contact itself to a 
rupture, and it is now driving the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to an acute phase of war. 
  The provocative steps taken at the so-called meeting of 
security-related ministers on 21 March was a sort of a 
declaration of total confrontation and a declaration of war 
against us. 
  Right after this reckless provocative declaration by the 
puppet rulers, the puppet forces entered into an emergency alert 
in South Korea and there are signs of moves to bring in new 
military equipment, including Patriot missiles from the United 
States. 
  The CPRF resolutely denounces in the name of the entire 
Korean people the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique for unilaterally 
breaking up the dialogue with fellow countrymen and pushing the 
country's situation to a very dangerous brink of war by 
following outside forces. 
  All of today's situation clearly shows that, from the very 
beginning, the South Korean rulers did not want peace and 
peaceful reunification of the country, not to speak of the 
exchange of special envoys, but used the North-South dialogue 
for their insidious aim of putting the brakes on the DPRK-U.S. 
talks. 
  The reality in which the country's situation is rushing to a 
new phase of war urges the whole nation to see with high 
consciousness what a grave situation has been caused by the 
criminal acts of the Kim Yong-sam ring in abandoning the 
North-South dialogue and obstructing the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  Facts show that the North and the South may fall victim to 
outside forces, failing to achieve reconciliation and 
reunification, while such flunkeyist nation-sellers and national 
traitors as the Kim Yong-sam ring are left alone in the country, 
the traitors who set greater store by the interests of outside 
forces than by the nation's security and interests and think 
more of their personal comfort and distinction than of the 
nation's destiny. 
  Now, the Kim Yong-sam ring has become unable to conceal the 
fact that it is an antinational group that blocks dialogue 
between the fellow countrymen and seeks to inflict the scourge 
of war upon the nation, keeping outside forces within the 
country. The national traitors must be removed and liquidated 
within the nation as early as possible. 
  As long as the South Korean people already judged that there 
is nothing more to expect from the Kim Yong-sam fascist 
nation-selling regime, we will carry out a resolute struggle to 
eliminate the nation-sellers in the hope of promoting 
reconciliation and unity between the North and the South and 
open the road for the country's peace and peaceful reunification.

  [Text] The saying, "A blackhearted person insists he does 
not have one," applies to South Korea's traitor Kim Yong-sam. 
  He, dining with stooges of a unit of the puppet Army on 19 
March, raved that only power can preserve peace, that they 
should not slacken their vigilance even for a minute, and so 
forth. This can only be called an absurd trick of a civilian 
warmonger. 
  The entire world knows that the puppets, under the sign 
board 
of peace, last year brought the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to the brink of war by running amok in war exercises 
and military buildup aimed at a Northward invasion. 
  Not long ago, puppet Kim Yong-sam has wandered South Korean 
military academies with the military chieftains, and enumerated 
bellicose outbursts, such as stressing the need to boost the 
combat capacity of the puppet Army to the greatest extent and on 
the ultra-modern weapons. Therefore, the peace the puppets are 
raving about is in fact a war. In this perspective, the rascal's 
trick that peace can only be preserved when there is peace is an 
open incitement of confrontation and agitation of war fever. 
  The fact that the puppets deliberately ruptured the 
working-level contacts for the exchange of high-level special 
envoys speaks well of their bellicose nature. From the 
beginning, they refused to accept our proposal on exchanging 
special envoys. What is more, they, after having reluctantly 
come out to the working-level delegates contact due to the 
public sentiment at home and abroad, created an artificial 
barrier to dialogues and hindered them with every means possible. 
  During the meeting they opposed our constructive and 
reasonable proposals without any reason and, behind the scene of 
dialogue, staged war exercises in the sky, on the ground, and on 
the sea almost every day. In doing so, they threw a cold 
blanket over the North-South talks and further aggravated 
North-South relations. 
  In particular, the puppets held a so-called strategic 
meeting 
of high-level ministers concerned and decided to toughen its 
stand against us. They even made severe outbursts that they 
would resume Team Spirit war exercise, bring in Patriot 
missiles, and join in sanctions against us. It goes without 
saying that this is a declaration of refusal of the exchange of 
special envoys, a declaration of an all-out confrontation and 
war with us. 
  The puppets are talking about peace, reunification, and so 
forth. However, in effect, they do not want either of them. The 
only intention they have is unleashing a new war by stepping up 
war preparations for a Northward invasion. If that is not the 
case, why would the Kim Yong-sam clique keep pushing for the 
military buildup and expedite the development of nuclear weapons 
by going against the world trend of arms reduction? In 
addition, why would they, in collaboration with the outside 
forces, take the road of war by shaking off the fellow 
countrymen's hands, and brutally suppress patriotic students who 
oppose war and strive for peace and reunification? 
  Confrontation and peace cannot go together. Confrontation 
will eventually lead to a collision and a collision will 
escalate to a war. No matter how many times the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet ring makes a peace gibberish, it would not be able to 
hide the ugly color of civilian warmonger who heightened the 
tension on the Korean peninsula and cast a somber cloud of war. 
As long as the Kim Yong- sam clique remains intact, our nation 
will not be able to evade suffering from the ravages of war. 
  The Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique, which is confronting the 
fellow countrymen's desire for peace and reunification and 
running amok in the North-South confrontation and maneuvers to 
unleash a war, would not be able to avoid the stern judgment of 
the history and the people.

<F P=106> [By Carlito Pablo] </F>
  [Text] Dissident cadres within the communist movement have 
warned that their ideological fray with rival groups could break 
out into a bloody confrontation. 
  A leader of the third faction that emerged from the 
splintering of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) 
charged that pro-Sison stalwarts have fielded a special armed 
unit in Metro Manila. 
  "We are appealing to former comrades at the top hierarchy to 
stick to friendly competition," said the third-bloc leader, who 
insisted on anonymity at the moment. 
  "But they should be forewarned that we have the capability 
to 
hit back if attacked first," he said. 
  The third faction, composed mostly of former members of the 
CPP National United Front Commission (NUFC), made known its 
breakaway from the 25-year-old Maoist party on Saturday [19 
March]. 
  Claiming to have its own fighting force and peasant-worker 
mass base, the group vowed to pursue a debate with rival 
factions to resolve festering questions of strategy and tactics. 
  The mainstream CPP is reportedly headed by Armando Liwanag, 
believed to be an assumed name of party founder Jose Maria 
Sison. It has retained strong control over the New People's Army. 
  Another group of party dissidents based in Metro Manila and 
parts of Rizal declared "autonomy" from the central leadership 
in July last year. Headed by Carlos Forte, the group controls 
an armed wing, the Alex Boncayao Brigade. 
  The party's splintering came after a plenum held by the CPP 
Central Committee in 1992 reaffirmed the Maoist strategy of 
encircling the cities from the countryside through an extensive 
guerrilla warfare . 
  The plenum repudiated the line of quick victory through 
urban 
uprisings and premature formation of regular guerrilla 
formations espoused by anti-Sison leaders. 
  A spokesman from the CPP's "caretaker NUFC" denied prospects 
that the bitter squabble over party politics would lead to an 
armed encounter. 
  "We are very confident that ringleaders of these two (Forte 
and third-bloc) factions will soon fade into irrelevance as 
their followers are slowly realizing that they have been 
misled," the spokesman said. 
  "Their political bankruptcy will push them into isolation 
and 
the party would have become stronger even without lifting a 
finger against them," he added. 
  The third-bloc cadre said a platoon-size unit has been 
"operationalized" by the CPP Central Committee after its members 
completed commando training recently in Batangas. 
  Tagged Edgar Jopson Brigade after a former student leader 
who 
was slain by soldiers in 1982 in Davao, the unit is allegedly 
composed of selected communist gunmen from Central Luzon, 
Southern Tagalog, Bicol, Samar and Mindanao. 
  Meanwhile, a leader of the National Confederation of Labor 
(NCL) yesterday clarified that his group's formation has nothing 
to do with the ongoing rift within the CPP. 
  Ibarra Malonzo, NCL secretary general, told the INQUIRER 
that 
majority of the federation's union affiliates have never been 
part of the CPP or its sympathizers. 
  Although they used to be affiliated with the militant 
Kilusang Mayo Uno [May First Movement], Malonzo said "we never 
considered we were part of the CPP or the national democratic 
forces." 
  The INQUIRER reported the other day that the third communist 
faction was believed to have been instrumental in the setting up 
of NCL and another political alliance, the Siglaya. 
  Siglaya and NCL leaders said their groups are "two totally 
different organizations from different initiatives."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 23 KYODO -- Japan would be unable to 
evacuate its nationals from the Korean peninsula using 
government aircraft or ships in the event of an outbreak of 
hostilities there, a senior Foreign Ministry official said 
Wednesday [23 March]. 
  "Neither government planes nor SDF ships could be used for 
the evacuation of Japanese nationals since the Self-Defense 
Forces (SDF) Law has yet to undergo revision," said the 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He noted that 
there are an estimated 10,000 Japanese nationals now residing in 
South Korea. 
  "If an unanticipated situation were to arise, private planes 
and boats would all come to a halt and it will become difficult 
to protect our nationals," the official said. 
  The official doubted that the United Nations Security 
Council 
will immediately slap economic sanctions on North Korea for 
failing to allow unimpeded international inspections of its 
controversial nuclear facilities.

  [Text] CANBERRA, March 23 (AFP) -- Sixteen Australian 
Federal Police officers leave here Thursday for six months' 
peacekeeping duty in Mozambique, a police spokesman said 
Wednesday. They will be the first Australians to participate 
actively in the United Nations' Mozambique peacekeeping mission, 
which is preparing the way for national elections later this 
year. 
  Mozambique suffered a protracted and devastating civil war 
which ended in 1992 when the government signed a peace agreement 
with right-wing rebels. 
  The spokesman said some of the 16 policemen bound for 
Mozambique had gained experience of peacekeeping police work 
with the police contingent to Cambodia in 1992-93. He said the 
Australians would be monitoring the ceasefire and supplementing 
local police in the lead up to the election.

  [Text] Private sector groups in the US have asked the US 
Trade Representative (USTR) to keep Thailand on the Priority 
Watch List (PWL) of countries monitored for their protection of 
intellectual property rights [IPR], because the amendment of the 
Thai draft Copyright Bill is still pending. 
  The Thai Commercial Counsellor in Washington, Nupthong 
Thongyai, said the US International Intellectual Property 
Alliance (IIPA) recently submitted a request to the USTR that 
Thailand be kept on the list until the Copyright Law is amended. 
  The IIPA also suggested placing China on the list of 
Priority 
Foreign Countries (PFC) which may face trade retaliation from 
the US because they do not have sufficient protection for US 
copyright works. It said copyright violations in China were 
hurting US manufacturers. China is on the PWL after being 
removed from the PFC list in 1991. 
  The US will announce this April whether it will remove 
Thailand from the PWL, but such a move is not expected until the 
draft amendment of the Copyright Law passes its third reading in 
Parliament. 
  A source in the Thai music industry said China was copying 
foreign compact discs. Some of the copies were being shipped to 
Thailand for sale locally and resale aboard. 
  Mr. Nupthong said the US still wanted Thailand to lower its 
tariffs on exposed film from the current rate of 10 baht per 
metre to five baht, but the case was not serious as the 
countries had agreed they should negotiate on this issue under 
General Agreement on Tariff and Trade talks.

  [Text] United Nations, March 22 (YONHAP) -- The five 
permanent members of the UN Security Council met Tuesday to put 
the finishing touches to a resolution due next week demanding 
that North Korea accept complete nuclear inspections. 
  Representatives from China, Russia, the United States, 
France 
and Britain held unofficial consultations in the afternoon. 
Council President Jean Bernard Merrimer, French ambassador to 
the United Nations, said after the meeting that they had begun 
to deal with the North Korean nuclear problem but that the 
resolution under discussion contained no sanctions. 
  In essence, the U.S.-prepared resolution calls on North 
Korea 
to immediately invite International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
experts to fulfill inspection requirements. 
  It says the council has decided to consider additional steps 
if necessary, hinting at sanctions in veiled language to win the 
approval of North Korea's longstanding ally, China. 
  The council adopted a resolution last May after Pyongyang 
announced in March that it was bolting the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty (NPT) to retaliate for IAEA inspection 
demands. 
  The draft of the second resolution emerged this week after 
the IAEA, following two weeks in North Korea, ruled it was not 
permitted to conduct a full inspection by Pyongyang and was thus 
unable to verify that North Korea had not diverted nuclear 
material for non-peaceful uses. 
  The resolution is expected to be adopted by consensus early 
next week after IAEA Director-General Hans Blix reports Thursday 
on where the situation now stands. 
  Five articles under the resolution ask the IAEA 
director-general to negotiate re-entry of the IAEA monitoring 
team into North Korea and to report the results to the council 
as soon as possible. 
  It urges South and North Korea to discuss implementing their 
agreement to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and asks all 
involved nations to help solve the problem. 
  The draft highlights the role of inter-Korean dialogue, 
saying the council reaffirms the importance of the agreement on 
denuclearization. 
  The resolution does not include harsh expressions such as 
"warn" or "sanctions," apparently in deference to China, which 
advocates diplomatic means and opposes sanctions. 
  But it leaves room for future action by suggesting the 
council's readiness to take additional steps. 
  Officials here said China did not express any specific 
opinions during the session.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 22 KYODO -- Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa urged the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum Tuesday [22 March] to have closer links 
with a nongovernmental Pacific economic council to promote 
economic cooperation in the region. 
  In a message addressed to the 10th assembly of the Pacific 
Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), Hosokawa said APEC and PECC 
"should complement each other by identifying complementary 
activities for the promotion of regional economic cooperation." 
This is because "PECC and APEC share common objectives and an 
equal recognition of the importance of facilitating and 
promoting Asia-Pacific economic cooperation," he said. 
  PECC, a nongovernmental organization formed in 1980, 
provides 
a forum for the region's best thinkers, business leaders and 
government officials to meet and exchange views every 18 months 
on ways to boost economic cooperation in the world's fastest 
growing region. 
  Hosokawa noted the importance of dialogue in boosting 
cooperation among countries in the region. Japan, he said, "is 
ready to make efforts to continue playing a positive role in 
promoting such cooperation." Hosokawa's message was read to the 
audience of 500 delegates. 
  He also expressed hope that trade blocs in the Asia-Pacific 
region such as the ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA] and the North 
American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] will not become economic 
fortresses. "I hope to see AFTA and NAFTA, while keeping up 
their coordination with GATT, continue to contribute to 
maintaining and strengthening the open and multilateral trading 
system," he said. 
  "Open, multilateral free trade under the auspices of GATT is 
of paramount importance for the development of not only the 
Asia-Pacific area but the entire world," he said.

  [Text] Security and defense officials of countries on the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have shelved a 
Philippine proposal to monitor conventional arms buildup and 
military expenditures in the region. They opted to determine 
first how a United Nations-sponsored arms register would fare 
out. 
  Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino, who 
attended 
the recent special ASEAN senior officials meeting in Bangkok, 
reported that ASEAN member-states have taken a cautious stand on 
the Philippine proposal since it was wider in scope than the 
existing UN arms monitoring mechanisms. 
  "More or less we felt that the UN arms register should be 
allowed to see how it works first," Severino said. 
  The UN arms register is limited to monitoring exports and 
imports of major weapons system such as missiles, tanks, and 
combat aircraft. The Philippine proposal includes the exchange 
of information among ASEAN member-states on the indigenous 
production of conventional arms systems and military 
expenditures.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur -- Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. 
Mahathir Mohamed yesterday declared that he would do everything 
possible to preserve the unity of the six-member ASEAN grouping. 
  He said that ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, 
the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, was central to the 
future of the region. 
  "Indeed, I confess, without any sense of guilt, that I will 
fight every impulse, contain every force, and confront any 
danger that will damage or destroy the ASEAN family," he said. 
  "For this, I make no apology. I express no reservation." 
  His unequivocal endorsement of ASEAN came in his opening 
address to the 10th Pacific Economic Co-operation Council (PECC) 
meeting in which he tried to place the grouping in the context 
of other regional associations. 
  Diplomats here said that his remarks underlined Malaysia's 
concern that the future development of the Asia Pacific Economic 
Co-operation forum (APEC) might drive a wedge through ASEAN. 
  Of all ASEAN members, Malaysia has the greatest reservation 
over APEC, arguing strongly that it should not be 
institutionalised. 
  In his speech, Dr. Mahathir urged the ASEAN community to 
open 
itself further so that its members could all become stronger, 
more competitive, and prosperous. 
  At a press conference later, he expressed optimism that the 
ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) could become a reality sooner than 
the 15-year deadline set at its first summit in Singapore. 
  "I am confident that the AFTA will not only lower the 
internal barriers but also the barriers to outside economies," 
he said. 
  Dr. Mahathir also called for the establishment of an 
egalitarian Pacific community in his keynote address. 
  "We cannot accept a Pax Sinica; we cannot accept a Pax 
Nipponica; we cannot accept a Pax Americana," he said. 
  "Instead, we believe in the establishment of a Pax Pacifica, 
a pax without an imperium, without a protector, and without an 
overlord." 
  But he also said that the Pacific community should be 
committed to open regionalism, adding that the best option was 
global free trade. 
  "Can we not all agree that global free trade, like democracy 
-- with all its inherent imperfections -- is by far the best 
option, ensuring the greatest good for the greatest number?" he 
asked. 
  "Given that trade blocs are not going to go away and may 
even 
proliferate, it surely requires statesmanship of the highest 
calibre to ensure they will be as open as possible to 
non-members and that they will contribute positively to global 
liberalism rather than global protectionism," he added.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur -- Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. 
Mahathir Mohamed yesterday said that there was no need for 
special security or economic arrangements to check the dominance 
of big powers in the region. 
  The prime minister also said that he did not see a need to 
maintain the military presence of the United States as a 
protector in the region, describing it as "a sheer waste of 
money". "I cannot speak for specific countries, but for the 
whole region I do not think we need the U.S. fleet patrolling 
the seas in this area. So much money is wasted," he told 
reporters after opening the 10th meeting of the Pacific Economic 
Co-operation Council (PECC). 
  "We do not believe in security agreements or security 
set-ups 
like the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ..." 
  Responding to questions about the possibility of Japan and 
China dominating the region, Dr. Mahathir said that they would 
"cancel each other, as there is mutual distrust". 
  "This is good, as one will balance the other. So there is no 
necessity for any special security arrangement or any 
arrangement to prevent the dominance of any economy over the 
rest of the region," he added. 
  Dr. Mahathir said that countries in East Asia could get 
along 
with each other and had no fear of Japan or China. 
  On the possibility that the two giants might be competing 
with each other by seeking allies, he said that the ASEAN 
countries rejected any such moves. 
  The regional grouping was also against getting involved in 
any such alliances. 
  Referring to the United States, he said that it could 
provide 
the "check and balance", without a need for its Seventh Fleet to 
patrol this area. 
  "The United States should stay in the United States, as much 
as Japan in Japan and China in China. We know they are strong 
... We do not want to disturb them and they should not want to 
disturb each other." 
  He added that the era of conquest and colonisation was over 
and countries should and would not go around conquering others 
any more. 
  Asked whether he was suggesting a total withdrawal of the 
U.S. military presence from the region, Dr. Mahathir said: "I 
would not be too upset if they withdraw. But some of the 
neighbours who feel unhappy about their neighbours may feel 
insecure and I cannot determine for them."

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 23 (ANTARA) -- Indonesia, which 
will host the informal summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum next November, has identified four 
areas of cooperation which may be intensively discussed during 
the conference, a senior minister has said. 
  Coordinating Minister of Industry and Trade Hartarto listed 
the potential areas of cooperation in a speech here Tuesday in a 
dinner party given to some 600 participants from 20 countries 
attending the three-day 10th meeting of the Pacific Economic 
Cooperation Council (PECC). 
  The PECC meeting began Tuesday. 
  The minister said that the four areas relate to the 
development of human resources, infrastructures, small and 
medium scale industries and the private sector's participation 
in economic cooperation. 
  Cooperation in the four areas, he said, will be concentrated 
on investment and regional trade, which will be implemented in 
conformity with the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs 
(GATT). 
  "We believe that assistance and support from the governments 
of member countries will make APEC activities this year useful," 
he added. 
  According to Hartarto, the decisions to be reached in the 
forthcoming summit will have a profound global impact as APEC 
will bring together the East and West countries as well as the 
North and South nations. 
  APEC, set up in 1989, now groups 17 countries comprising 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei Darussalam, the 
Philippines, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, People's China, South Korea, Japan, Mexico 
and Papua New Guinea. 
  The minister further said that the North-South dialogue and 
economic cooperation will take on a global scale once the 
dialogue and economic cooperation in Asia and the Pacific become 
successful. 
  On the first day of the PECC meeting, Hartarto talked about 
APEC problems, free trade areas and open regionalism. 
  He said that regional trade alliances is now a permanent 
part 
of a global trade system and that open regionalism is currently 
based on regional expansion and global trade. 
  Although designed to support local industries, regional 
trade 
alliance is by no means meant to discriminate against 
corporations from outside the region concerned, he added.

North, Southeast, and West Pacific, are also pledged to fulfill 
their commitments to meet the challenges of open regionalism. 
  The chairman of the meeting, Datuk Dr. Nordin Sopiee, 
announced that five points were underlined by the council in 
order to meet the challenges. This includes to review its 
priority in allocating resources to champion open regionalism in 
the pursuit of regional economic cooperation. He said the 
council will also establish processes aand instruments for 
studying and monitoring the development of protection and

<F P=106> [Interview with Administrative Vice Foreign Minister </F>
Kunihiko Saito by unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Japan's foreign policy has so 
far been based on the axis of Japanese-U.S. relations. How 
about the possibility of Japan altering its foreign policy 
following the end of the cold war? 
  [Saito] Japan should continue to seek the axis of 
coordinates 
[zahyojiku] of its foreign policy in relations with the United 
States. The United States is among the nations that share 
Japan's values and systems, and it has the most powerful 
influence among them. Japan has relied on the Japan-U.S. 
Security Treaty for its security. Now that the relatively 
simple structure of the East-West confrontation has changed and 
a new complicated structure has emerged in the world, elements 
that Japan must take into account are growing in number. The 
role to be played by Japan in resolving global problems such as 
overpopulation and the environment is increasing, and Japan will 
have to make more contributions to maintaining world peace. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] As for Japan's international 
contributions, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], has put forward a plan to turn Japan into 
a "normal nation" that can make even military contributions. 
  [Saito] It is clear that there are constitutional 
constraints 
on what Japan can do. Bureaucrats should not debate amending 
the Constitution. Nonetheless, there still are things that 
Japan can do within the framework of the current Constitution. 
The International Peace Cooperation Law has just been enacted, 
and it is necessary to proceed cautiously in interpreting the 
law. It cannot be said that Japan has made contributions to the 
international community to the very limits of its constitutional 
constraints. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The February Japan-U.S. summit talks 
broke off. Would you comment on these? 
  [Saito] I think that this was very regrettable. It was a 
matter of course for Japan to reject the U.S. demand to set 
numerical targets as long as the United States stuck to this 
demand. If the Japanese Government committed itself to trade 
matters that are beyond its authority, this would force Japanese 
enterprises to engage in managed trade. Managed trade runs 
counter to what the Hosokawa cabinet intends to do. 
  If Japan went along with the United States on the demand to 
set numerical targets, it would have only deferred the solution 
of trade issues between the two countries. Although 
Japanese-U.S. relations would have improved temporarily, it is 
clear that Japan one or two years later would have been unable 
to meet the numerical targets. If the United States were to 
criticize Japan one or two years later for failing to live up to 
its promises, Japanese-U.S. relations would be worse than they 
are now. Japan cannot do such an irresponsible thing. 
  The breaking off of the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks dealt 
a blow to Japanese-U.S. relations, and Japan has to make efforts 
to patch up relations with the United States. Trade issues 
between Japan and the United States stem from Japan's huge trade 
surplus with the United States. The United States has contended 
that it can no longer tolerate the trade imbalance, and we are 
well aware of the U.S. position. Japan should understand the 
U.S. position on the trade imbalance and should make its utmost 
efforts to correct the trade imbalance. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What should Japan itself be thinking 
about? 
  [Saito] If there is anything that Japan must reflect upon, 
it 
is Japan's failure to get its message across to the United 
States that Japan seriously intends to spur its economy and that 
it is resolved to cut taxes deeply to that end. Japan should 
have articulated its plans to the United States. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The Foreign Ministry is losing its 
influence at home. What do you think about this? 
  [Saito] You are right. It would be good if it had more 
influence at home, but.... 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Have Japanese-U.S. relations 
matured into an "adult relationship"? 
  [Saito] I think that Japanese-U.S. relations have already 
matured into an adult relationship. Japan has said no to the 
United Sates. Japan has asserted what it has had to do and it 
has conceded what it has had to concede. I do not think that 
the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks began a completely new age in 
postwar Japanese-U.S. relations. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Is there not a fear that the Japanese 
have become more or less nationalistic? 
  [Saito] I have not received such an impression. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The United States has been 
criticizing 
Japan's bureaucrats. Would you comment on this? 
  [Saito] I believe that this criticism is based on a 
misunderstanding. In some ways, Japanese bureaucrats must 
review their practices; Japanese bureaucrats have stuck to their 
past practices. In the eyes of Americans, Japanese bureaucrats 
are conservatives. Americans appear to have the impression that 
"Japanese bureaucrats are bad guys who cause politicians to drag 
their feet," but most of their impression is based on a 
misunderstanding. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Who is deciding Japan's foreign 
policy? Politicians or bureaucrats? 
  [Saito] What the bureaucrats must do is plan and draft 
Japan's foreign policy, and then the politicians must make a 
final decision on Japan's foreign policy. The role of 
bureaucrats is to use their experiences to compile their 
recommendations in an objective way and to present these to the 
politicians. Depending on the circumstances, bureaucrats should 
make recommendations and submit these to the politicians. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you think that the consistency of 
Japan's foreign policy should be maintained despite a change of 
government? 
  [Saito] As far as the present coalition government is 
concerned, it announced shortly after it came to power that it 
will continue Japan's established foreign and security policies. 
My opinion is that, if a political party with completely 
different foreign and security policies comes to power, the 
Foreign Ministry has the responsibility to present vigorously 
its recommendations to the ruling party to keep Japan's foreign 
policy as consistent as possible. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Mr. Ozawa has proposed introducing a 
"senior vice minister system" [fukudaijinsei] with the aim of 
reflecting politicians' ideas in policies. What do you think of 
this? 
  [Saito] Introducing the senior vice minister system is a 
great idea. If senior vice ministers assume the responsibility 
of answering questions in the Diet, this would leave ministers 
free to visit other nations and meet with key foreign officials. 
Foreign policy should be planned and drafted calmly and 
objectively on the basis of experiences without any specific 
position being taken into account. There is no way but for 
bureaucrats to do that work. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The issue of North Korea's suspected 
nuclear development program is heightening tensions. 
  [Saito] If the United Nations adopts a resolution on the 
matter, it is a matter of course that Japan will take full 
measures to implement the resolution, within the framework of 
the Constitution. Japan's role in implementing the resolution 
will be great. The nations that will face a threat from North 
Korea are Japan and South Korea. If Japan deals with the 
resolution indifferently or reluctantly, it will lose the trust 
of the international community and greatly harm Japanese-U.S. 
relations.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Requests to the Government Regarding Auto </F>
Trade Frictions"] 
  [Text] To improve trade ties between Japan and the United 
States, Japanese automakers are soon to disclose their voluntary 
action plans to increase procurement of auto parts from U.S. 
manufacturers. Concerning this, Yutaka Kume, chairman of the 
Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, said: "These are 
voluntary plans to be carried out by the private sector. It is 
improper for the government to comment on them." He then 
demanded that automakers' plans not be included in a package of 
government market-opening measures to be disclosed at the end of 
March. 
  We support Kume's opinion. The Japanese Government should be 
discreet in word and deed, or automakers' voluntary plans might 
be considered to be an agreement between the two governments. 
  The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other U.S. 
Government offices in charge of trade with Japan have asserted 
that the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] gave auto manufacturers guidance in compiling their 
voluntary plans. They said that because the plans were 
formulated under the government's guidance, it was necessary for 
the Japanese Government to guarantee them. 
  To refute such U.S. assertions, MITI should refrain from 
giving automakers administrative guidance whereby it pokes its 
nose into their business behind the scenes. It is not good if 
what the government has asserted in talks with Washington is 
inconsistent with what it has done to domestic companies. 
  In the framework trade talks, Washington has demanded that 
Japanese automakers procure more auto parts from U.S. 
manufacturers and that Japan take measures to help the U.S. Big 
Three increase their sales in the Japanese market. It has also 
demanded that the Japanese Government guarantee that these goals 
be achieved. 
  Tokyo has rejected these demands by saying that the 
government cannot control private sector business activities. 
However, because Japan's exports of autos and auto parts to the 
United States exceed its imports from the United States and 
because the framework trade talks remain stalled, the government 
has called on the auto industry to compile and disclose 
voluntary plans to expand parts procurement and to help U.S. 
automakers increase sales in Japan. 
  Automakers are worried that their voluntary plans might be 
included in the government's market-opening measures. If they 
are included, it will be considered that the Japanese Government 
is responsible for carrying out the voluntary plans. 
  When former U.S. President George Bush visited Japan two 
years ago, the government forced automakers to work out plans to 
increase their imports and procurement of U.S.-made autos and 
auto parts and included them in the action plan issued at the 
end of the Japan-U.S. summit talks. After that, it pressed them 
to carry out their plans, and automakers tried to achieve their 
goals at an immense cost. 
  This has set a bad precedent. Washington has now demanded 
plans to expand Japan's imports and procurement of U.S.-made 
autos and auto parts, as well as a guarantee from the Japanese 
Government to carry out the plans. However, from the viewpoint 
of deregulation and free trade, the government should quit 
poking its nose into voluntary efforts by automakers. 
  The government forced semiconductor makers to carry out the 
Japan-U.S. semiconductor accord and automakers to carry out 
their action plans compiled two years ago by justifying its 
demands as means to improve ties between Japan and the United 
States. The companies still are affected by these demands. The 
government should not make the same mistake.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 24 March Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] In connection with the U.S. Government's demand for 
compensation from Japanese construction companies for alleged 
"dango" [bid-rigging] on construction work at the U.S. Atsugi 
Naval Station, a majority of the general contractors and civil 
engineering firms involved have decided to reject the demand, 
claiming: "This issue has been resolved; we do not intend to 
meet the demand" (according to Nishimatsu Construction Company, 
Ltd.). These companies will send a letter to the law firm 
representing the U.S. Government before 25 March, the deadline 
set by the United States for a reply, and inform it of their 
rejection. Since the Japanese parties have come out clearly 
with the intention of contesting the claim, there is now a 
strong possibility that the U.S. Government will file a lawsuit. 
  Nishimatsu, a second-tier general contractor, denied there 
was any inflation of contract fees through bid-rigging as 
claimed by the United States. It stated with confidence: "The 
profit (from the Atsugi Base construction work) was a few 
percent. We are still undecided about whether or not to respond 
to the lawsuit [sosho ni ojiru ka do ka], but if we compile the 
available data at that time to argue our case, we will surely 
win." Penta-Ocean Construction Company, Ltd., also said: "We 
will just state in a brief letter that we say `no.'" Maeda 
Corporation, which currently holds chairmanship of the Japan 
Federation of Construction Contractors, says "we cannot meet the 
demand." It will send out the letter of rejection on 24 March.

<F P=106> [Panel discussion by Shunji Yanai, director general of the </F>
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Foreign Policy Bureau; Maki Okada, 
chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs European and Oceanic 
Affairs Bureau, East Europe Division; and Teruaki Nagasaki, 
chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs International 
Cooperation Department, Refugees Assistance Office, on 20 
January; place not given: "What Can Japan Do for the Former 
Yugoslavia?"] 
  [Text] Details of the Survey on Yugoslavia, and the 
Actual Situation in Respective Areas 
  [GAIKO FORUM] A "survey team on the former Yugoslavia" 
consisting mainly of Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] staff 
members was sent to the area in January this year. Today, I 
want to ask you about the situation there and the purpose of 
sending the survey team. 
  [Yanai] Although Japan used to have relations with the 
former Yugoslavia, frankly, unlike the European countries, we 
were not necessarily familiar with the detailed situation in 
that country. Therefore, to study what policies we should set 
up and what contributions we should make in dealing with the 
problems of peace and humanity existing in the former Yugoslavia 
that are creating world-wide concern, it was decided the MOFA as 
a body would make an on-the-spot study -- without confining its 
activities to collecting data through embassies in foreign 
countries -- to grasp the actual situation. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] When peace was being sought in Cambodia, 
opposition and doubts about participation were raised among the 
Japanese people. Fortunately, however, peace has been restored. 
Notwithstanding, we notice opinions in the newspapers about the 
situation in Yugoslavia being very complicated. Under such 
circumstances, you have dared to start a study on Yugoslavia. 
What kind of survey did you carry out? 
  [Yanai] First, let me introduce the outline. It is true 
there is the opinion that, while it is understandable for Japan 
to be involved in Cambodia which is located in Asia, why should 
it go as far as Europe? However, the significance of the 
problem of peace and humanity should not be determined by the 
distance. Since such a serious problem is going to have global 
influence, our country should not remain indifferent on the 
grounds it is a problem in Europe. 
  In the case of Cambodia, Japan was also seriously concerned 
about the situation. International cooperation, with the 
European countries, and Central and South American countries 
rushing to the spot, was realized in the process of restoring 
peace in Cambodia, in the peacekeeping operations [PKO], and in 
carrying out humanistic assistance activities, thus making it 
possible to attain the objectives. We have learned from this 
how important it is for the world to concentrate its strength to 
solve such a serious problem. 
  The first step of our survey was to grasp the Yugoslav 
situation. We visited all the countries which constitute the 
former Yugoslavia except Montenegro -- Croatia, Slovenia, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Serbia. Some of the 
countries have attained independence and been recognized by our 
country, and some of them are not yet independent. We met with 
key figures of the respective countries, and studied their 
actual situations. 
  In addition, UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force], the 
UNHCR [UN Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees], and 
other international organs are located within the area, and we 
talked with people associated with the various organizations. We 
had an opportunity to observe the situation of the respective 
countries and international activities taking place there. 
  Even today, when we hear the name Yugoslavia, we tend to 
imagine a united area. However, the various areas of Yugoslavia 
are quite different. I do not think it correct to try to 
understand the respective areas indiscriminately. 
  Let me briefly describe the situation of each area. Slovenia 
has become completely independent, and presently there is no 
military dispute at all. 
  In Croatia, there are two big problems. One is its relations 
with the Serbian people living in Croatia. This is a very 
serious confrontation which developed into a clash of military 
powers. Another problem is the conflict between the Croatian 
people and other races living in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina, there is a confrontation 
among three groups--the Croatian, Serbian, and Islamic people 
(hereinafter referred to as Muslims). Unfortunately, the 
confrontation among these three groups has now developed into a 
military conflict. 
  Macedonia has attained independence peacefully, and there 
has 
been no military conflict at all. The country remains quiet. 
Potentially, however, there is the problem of the minority race 
of Albanian people in Macedonia. Also, there is the danger that 
the problem involving Albanians living in the autonomous state 
of Kosovo, Serbia, north of Macedonia, might involve the country. 
  As for Serbia -- with Montenegro we call it "the Union of 
New Yugoslavia" -- affected by the war, the country is broken 
economically and is also subject to economic sanctions. Its 
currency system has totally collapsed, and it is suffering an 
inflation rate of astronomical figures. However, there is no 
military conflict within Serbia. Besides, the Serbian people 
are united very firmly under the leadership of President 
Milosevic. 
  As we have seen, a considerable difference exists between 
each area and, accordingly, the United Nations is carrying out 
different PKO in respective areas. In Croatia, the UN 
Peacekeeping Forces are stationed in the Serbian residential 
areas to control the reoccurrence of conflict. In 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the PKO's [peacekeeping operations] main 
task is to secure the safety of personnel engaged in 
humanitarian aid. Developing preventive activities is the PKO's 
task in Macedonia. Moreover, UNHCR-sponsored humanitarian 
activities are being developed in various districts of the 
former Yugoslavia. 
<H5>  The Muslims Have No Intention of Seeking Peace </H5>
  [Okada] Let me explain how we were dealing with the Yugoslav 
situation prior to our recent survey. Besides grasping the 
situation as a whole, we participated in discussions at various 
international levels; in particular, we participated in those 
sponsored by the United Nations and, further, offered 
humanitarian aid mainly through the UNHCR. 
  In the process of our participating in such international 
activities, there is one thing I noticed: The Yugoslav problem 
is viewed as serious in the United States and Russia, as well as 
Europe. On the other hand, though there are fragmentary reports 
in newspapers, Yugoslavia is very remote from Japan in terms of 
geography and culture, and many Japanese people, including those 
who are in comparatively responsible positions, tend to respond: 
"Yugoslavia? -- That problem is too difficult for me to 
understand." 
  It may be true that, seen from a comparatively narrow 
viewpoint based on our historical, social, and economic 
relations with the country, Yugoslavia's problems are not likely 
to deeply affect our national interests. However, Japan 
declares itself to be a country that shares global values with 
other democratic countries. If, for instance, the Japanese 
people really believe in the significance of democracy, human 
rights, and humanism, they may as well express their opinions 
based on their beliefs -- even though the problem may be 
complicated in nature and difficult to understand, as is the 
case of Yugoslavia. 
  When visiting the area, I was particularly impressed to 
discover two new facts: First, I found out that, at present, 
the Muslim side is not willing to obtain peace. I had to renew 
my recognition of this. The Serbian side, having already 
obtained what it wanted in Bosnia-Herzegovina and being accused 
internationally, is willing to make an appropriate compromise to 
achieve peace. Croatia, presently being attacked by the Muslims, 
wants to achieve a cease-fire one way or another; and, to attain 
this purpose, seems to be making various concessions concerning 
conditions for peace. I realized that only fragmentary reports 
about these situations were available to the outside world. 
  Then, talking with European and U.S. diplomats and other 
officials in the area, I was strongly convinced that they have a 
serious aversion to Milosevic as a symbol of great Serbianism, 
and as a Stalinist. In short, everything is being dealt with in 
the recognition that Serbia is to blame and that, compared to 
Serbia, the other countries are acceptable. They intend to 
achieve peace by suppressing Serbia. However, since Serbia has 
strength, it must be controlled by military force. But, the 
European countries and the United States seem to be somewhat 
hesitant about taking such action as it is likely to result in a 
serious sacrifice for them. Seemingly, they are distressed with 
this dilemma as what they believe in is not supported by their 
ability to realize it. However, even concerning recognition of 
the facts on which their belief is based, I question whether it 
is really justifiable for them to one-sidedly make a judgment to 
that extent. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] If the Muslims do not want peace, what do 
they intend to do? 
  [Okada] The Muslim experienced a very serious defeat in the 
initial stage of the conflict. Most of the weapons of the 
former Yugoslav allied forces were transferred to Serbia, which 
was the main part of the allied forces. As a result, Serbia, 
although its strength was inferior in terms of the number of 
soldiers, was able to win victories one after another in its 
military actions. 
  Then, the Muslim group, which had been in a continuously 
inferior position throughout the period, changed to the 
offensive around the autumn of last year. Though the Muslim 
group does not seem to have greatly expanded its territories 
through military actions against Serbia, the group had won 
victories one after another in its territorial competition 
against Croatia, thus placing several cities under its control. 
Therefore, the group may be feeling confident that, if they try 
harder in the future, they might be able to recover what they 
lost during the military conflicts. That is why they do not want 
to compromise for peace. 
  Also, we can point out the fact that the opinion of the 
international community is on the side of the Muslims. For 
example, while it is the actual situation in Sarajevo that the 
attacks are mostly made by the Muslim side and no attack is 
being made by Serbia, it has been reported in most cases that 
Serbia is making the attacks, thus bringing about casualties. 
We may say that the newspapers or the mass media are being 
skillfully controlled from behind the scenes. 
<H5>  A Unique Case of Assisting Refugees </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] Mr. Nagasaki, what is your opinion as one in 
charge of assisting the refugees? 
  [Nagasaki] It is our duty to assist refugees not only in 
Yugoslavia, but throughout the world. Basically, there are 
various organizations such as the UNHCR, WFP [World Food 
Program], the International Migration Organization, and the 
International Red Cross Council. According to the "White Paper 
on Refugees" the UNHCR issued last year, the number of refugees 
throughout the world was reported to be approximately 19 
million. The number of refugees from Yugoslavia -- in the case 
of Yugoslavia, in addition to the "refugees," there are 
so-called "domestic refugees" who are taking refuge within the 
country -- shows a very large figure of 4.25 million. In the 
past, the problem of refugees used to be understood as a problem 
which tends to take place in developing countries. The problem 
of refugees of Yugoslavia can be considered a unique refugee 
problem taking place in an advanced area. 
  Besides, though we talk about the former Yugoslavia, it 
consists of totally different areas. In particular, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is a troubled area where the battle fronts 
are being built up with all the military forces jumbled 
together. In a normal situation, a battle takes place first, 
and then an international organ helps the refugees who have 
escaped from the front lines. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, however, 
the international organ goes to the spot where a conflict is 
taking place and develops its action to offer humanitarian aid. 
Moreover, in the recent conflict, particularly in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the three groups were, after all, competing 
with each other to secure their positions. In such a situation, 
though each group is supposed to welcome humanitarian aid under 
a normal situation, we had to face various political 
disturbances. I realized that the case of Yugoslavia is a very 
unique one in which the humanitarian aid is being offered under 
a very difficult situation where the conflicts and the problem 
of refugees are taking place concurrently. 
  In Yugoslavia, we had the opportunity of listening to the 
opinions of personnel who are offering humanitarian aid under 
the UNHCR and the WFP; in Croatia, we visited the refugee camps 
operated by the Red Cross of Denmark; and in Serbia, we visited 
the refugee camps operated by the Serbian Government authorities 
in the locality. We realized that every facility is in a 
serious condition. 
  One thing I want to say is that the form, or should I say 
the 
difficulty, of humanitarian aid differs depending on the place. 
Typically different is the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina where it 
is difficult to secure access even if we want to transport goods 
for humanitarian aid. In the case of Serbia and new Yugoslavia, 
the refugees and the weak are presently in a very tough 
situation because of the economic sanctions in addition to the 
chronically aggravated economic conditions. 
<H3>  What Are the Opinions of Other Countries About Japan's 
Concern? </H3>
  [GAIKO FORUM] The actual situation seems quite different 
from 
Japanese press reports. 
  Nevertheless, while speculations by neighboring countries, 
and speculations by Italy, the United States, and all the other 
European countries are being entangled with one another in 
addition to the UN activities, the activity of the Japanese 
people, such as Yasushi Akashi and Sadako Ogata and others, is 
being highlighted, though it may be accidental. It is likely 
that they might feel anxious about Japan's being concerned with 
the problems of former Yugoslavia. What is the reaction of the 
neighboring countries? 
  [Yanai] As you mentioned, since days gone by, countries such 
as Austria, Turkey, Italy, France, Germany, and also Russia and 
other countries were very much concerned about the former 
Yugoslavia, or about the Balkan Peninsula if we take a broader 
area. In the past, there was a struggle among the great powers 
to expand their sphere of influence over the area. All the 
countries located on the Balkan Peninsula, including the former 
Yugoslavia, also once competed with one another for hegemony in 
their respective areas. However, the situation has changed today 
and, within the framework of the United Nations, all the 
countries are cooperating with each other to restore peace and 
to offer humanitarian aid. Although their interests are not 
completely identical as each country has its own national 
interests, at present there is fortunately no struggle among the 
great powers as was seen in the past. 
  Japanese people have appeared on the stage under such 
circumstances. I think Japanese people are rather welcome to 
the arena, and there will be no negative feeling toward Japan as 
long as Japan also lends its hand to restore peace and to offer 
humanitarian aid. 
  Additionally, regardless of districts, the people of the 
former Yugoslavia are very friendly to Japan. One reason may be 
that, historically, our country has never interfered in the area 
with any ambitions. Also, their feeling toward Japan is very 
friendly because there was a very favorable relationship between 
the two countries when Yugoslavia was the Socialist Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia. In view of such relations, it is 
considered very natural for us to help the area one way or 
another. 
  Also, by chance, Japanese citizens were appointed heads of 
the UN organizations having ties with the area. Ogata is the 
high commissioner for refugees, and Akashi is special envoy of 
the secretary general of the United Nations in charge of 
Yugoslav problems. Also, there is another Japanese, Secretary 
General Hiroshi Nakajima of WHO. As WHO is also offering 
humanitarian aid with medical supplies and more, it turns out 
that the three organizations are coincidentally headed by 
Japanese. Although not because of this fact, we tend to feel 
like cooperating with these leaders. 
<H5>  Yugoslavia in East Europe </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] By the way, in a sense the Cold War seems to 
have functioned as a kind of stabilizing factor for the Balkan 
situation, including the former Yugoslavia. However, it seems 
that this time the ethnic problem has erupted now that the 
stabilizing factor has been totally removed. How should we 
understand the future Yugoslav situation within the total 
framework of East Europe? 
  [Okada] In East Europe, there is no other place where the 
ethnic problem is as complicated as in Yugoslavia. However, 
besides Yugoslavia, there are certain countries which are more 
or less involved in racial problems. As you know, as of 1 
January 1993 Czechoslovakia was divided peacefully into the 
Czech Republic and Slovakia. Also, there may have been other 
places where national consciousness was once sharply exalted 
when the stabilizing factor in the form of the Cold War was 
removed. However, they may have become rather prudent in their 
own way because of the miserable situation taking place in 
Yugoslavia. 
  A potentially most serious problem besides that of 
Yugoslavia 
is that of the Hungarian people who are in foreign countries. In 
particular, about 600,000 Hungarians are included in the 5.3 
million population of the new Slovakia, and nearly 2 million 
Hungarians are living in Romania's Transylvania. In addition, 
Hungarians are also living in the autonomous state of Vojvodina 
(in Serbia), north of Yugoslavia. Therefore, some people fear 
that, if the various problems taking place in Serbia lead to 
oppression of the minority race of Hungarians living in 
Yugoslavia, the oppression might stimulate the national 
consciousness of people of Hungarian descent, which might come 
to involve other areas. 
  Another problem, which is considered a little more 
realistic threat, is the problem of the people of Albanian 
descent. About 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, Serbia, 
is Albanian, and, in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
[FYROM], south of Serbia, about 20 percent of its population is 
Albanian according to official statistics -- although Albanians 
claim the ratio should be over 40 percent. 
  When we talk about FYROM, it should be understood that the 
Macedonian nation was first recognized by the late President 
Tito. Bulgarian people still think they are West Bulgarians, and 
the nationalistic Serbian people call them South Serbians. 
Greece also thinks FYROM was originally part of Greece. Such 
being the situation, there were two Balkan wars involving the 
area prior to World War I. In that sense, though the conflict 
is presently taking the form of a civil war within the former 
Yugoslavia, should relations between the Albanians and the 
Macedonians worsen, creating a conflict around the area, it is 
feared that an international conflict might take place involving 
Bulgaria and Greece in addition to Serbia and Albania. 
<H5>  Comparison of the Situation With the Cambodian Peace </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] In the case of the Cambodian peace, we noticed 
the interesting phenomenon that all the people were somehow 
united under a symbolic person called Prince Sihanouk (the 
present king). In Yugoslavia, is there any person who can be a 
key person to bring about a peaceful solution of the conflicts? 
  [Yanai] It is a very interesting idea to compare the 
Yugoslav situation with that of Cambodia. Certainly, in the 
case of Cambodia there is a charismatic figure called Sihanouk 
whom even the Pol Pot faction respects, thus making it possible 
to set up a framework for peace under him. To our regret, there 
is no such person in Yugoslavia. Though, in the past, there 
used to be a person called Tito, there is presently no one to 
replace him. 
  Another difference is that, in the case of Cambodia, the 
Paris Peace Conference was held, and a very comprehensive 
agreement called the Paris peace accord was signed. The accord 
was not merely an agreement for a cease-fire, but it provided 
for the peace process as a whole. There is a framework formed 
by the countries concerned, including our country, to support 
this agreement, and PKO was carried out based on this framework. 
In the case of Yugoslavia, however, there is no such total 
framework for peace, thus creating a very difficult situation 
with peace talks being held on one hand, and the PKO and 
humanitarian activities being carried out on the other. 
  [Yanai] Then, do you mean that the way for peace has not yet 
been paved [in former Yugoslavia] as in the case of Cambodia? 
  [Yanai] I am afraid I should admit that. 
<H5>  What Can Japan Do? -- The Form of Cooperation and Assistance </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] By the way, I want to ask what Japan can 
really do. What form of cooperation and assistance can Japan 
offer? Public opinion in Japan has also changed since the 
Cambodian peace was achieved. The opinions in the past 
supporting the one-nation pacifism have disappeared, and now the 
Japanese people think Japan should not offer economic assistance 
alone, but should make international contributions. However, 
there seems to be anxiety about the possibility of Japan's 
making an over-commitment as a political superpower. Taking 
such public opinion into consideration, what kind of 
contributions do you think possible for Japan? 
  [Yanai] In the first place, various requests were presented 
by the local side during the process of our survey. Those 
requests may be roughly divided into three categories - requests 
by the countries constituting the former Yugoslavia, requests by 
the UNPROFOR headed by Akashi, and requests from the standpoint 
of offering humanitarian aid. 
  First, of the countries which constituted former Yugoslavia, 
Croatia, Slovenia, and FYROM, which have been recognized by our 
country, expressed both the government's and the private 
sectors' earnest desire to deepen their relationship [with 
Japan]. As a necessary step, they wanted to have Japanese 
embassies established in their countries. 
  Particularly in the case of FYROM, because its economy is 
the 
most inferior of the former Yugoslav countries and, moreover, 
because the country has been separated due to the economic 
sanctions from Serbia and other countries which used to be 
traditional markets for FYROM, the country earnestly wants Japan 
to offer its economic cooperation, and to introduce Japanese 
private enterprises to the country. Also, for the time being, 
they earnestly want Japan to help them in dealing with the 
accumulated debts and more. 
  Second, concerning the UNPROFOR headed by Akashi, it was 
earnestly requested that Japan send an administrative official 
to assist Akashi, and to meet the request it has been decided 
that Assistant Division Chief Tomiko Ichikawa of the UN 
Administrative Division, International Cooperation Department, 
Foreign Policy Bureau, is to be sent to the area as an 
administrative official. 
  Also, in view of the successful experience in Cambodia, they 
requested that a venue for a conference with major countries be 
set up. The purpose of setting up the conference is that they 
want to perform their peace-seeking duties in Zagreb, capital of 
Croatia, where the UNPROFOR is headquartered, so they can hold 
discussions on various problems with ambassadors and other 
officials from the respective major countries and, therefore, 
they want Japan to be prepared to join the conference at the 
earliest stage possible. 
  Also, as a general idea, we talked about the possibility of 
Japan sending staff members to the UNPROFOR or other unit of the 
PKO. Though it was not an official request by the United 
Nations, a PKO commanding officer in FYROM said in general terms 
that the PKO, which was developing the security operations, was 
in need of military monitors -- they are unarmed monitors -- 
and, therefore, it would be welcome if Japan could send such 
staff members. Also, it was reported that transportation and 
other equipment were in short supply. 
  Third, three requests were presented with respect to the 
humanitarian aid. It was reported that, although refugees were 
being taken care of at present either by the refugee camps or by 
general households, there were in any case not enough facilities 
to receive all the refugees. And Japan was asked for aid in 
this respect. In the case of the former Yugoslavia -- different 
from Cambodia -- solidly built houses are necessary as the 
refugees are in cold areas. 
  Second, with regard to humanitarian aid which is being 
offered by international organizations other than the UNHCR, 
such as WHO, UNICEF, and the International Red Cross, it was 
expressed in a general form that, while Japan had already been 
largely cooperating with these organizations, they expect Japan 
to continue its aid in the future. 
  The third point was with regard to medical problems. They 
said that, in the former Yugoslavia, they have doctors, nurses, 
and hospital buildings. However, there is a serious shortage of 
medical equipment and medicines. 
  [Okada] Different from the case of Cambodia, I do not think 
Japan is going to be deeply involved in the problem of peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. So far, the EC has been taking 
the initiative [in dealing with the problem of peace in 
Yugoslavia], with the United Nations helping the EC in matters 
which it cannot deal with. The peace talks in Yugoslavia have 
been chaired jointly, literally, by Owen, representing the EC 
(EU), and Stoltenberg, representing the United Nations. Behind 
the peace talks are NATO and the military power of the United 
States trying to find a way toward peace. I do not think there 
is any chance for us to enter the scene and to play an actual 
role in forming a framework for peace. 
  What Mr. Akashi actually does will not be to take part in 
the 
peace-seeking process. Anyway, we are going to continuously 
observe the situation with interest, and we may be asked to play 
a role within our capacity. What we have been doing is to 
participate in sanctions, to put political pressure on the 
parties concerned, and to participate in talks. I do not think 
there is any role different in quality from these to be played 
by us in the future. 
  There are also other fields Japan should do something about. 
For instance, it seems important to build up relations with 
those countries which have attained independence. In the case 
of FYROM, for example, new conflicts might take place should the 
living conditions of the people be aggravated. To prevent such 
a situation from taking place, Japan is expected to cooperate in 
elevating the economic level of the society. I think that, from 
now on Japan should offer its help in these fields to the extent 
possible. 
  The national administrative structure of Japan is very 
rigid, and it is not possible to promptly set up an embassy even 
if a new nation is formed. Only two or three embassies have 
recently been established even in the former USSR. Therefore, 
it is important to deal with the situation, making the most of 
the already existing systems. The problem is, for instance, how 
to deal with a country like FYROM. No ambassador has been 
assigned to our embassy in Belgrade as the situation does not 
allow us to do so, and it is also not possible to take a plane 
from the area because it has been subjected to sanctions. We 
must drive for hours to get there. Telephone connections are 
also terrible. We should first take such local conditions into 
account when we try to do something in the area. 
  Another problem is how to maintain Japan's presence in these 
areas. For instance, I was very impressed to see a bonkei [a 
tray landscape] at a hotel where we stayed in FYROM. It was 
gorgeous. While there are only a few Japanese married to local 
citizens, there is an association called the Macedonia 
[FYROM]-Japan Association with one thousand and several hundred 
members, and everyone is studying about Japan very hard. From a 
broader point of view, we want to study in what area and in what 
form we can offer our assistance to such areas. 
  [Nagasaki] Though it is not well known, Japan has offered 
aid to the former Yugoslavia through international organizations 
in the considerably large amount of $82 million. As far as the 
former Yugoslavia is concerned, the total sum of our aid as of 
the end of November 1993 ranked the third in the world, next to 
EC and the United States. We intend to exert ourselves to 
effectively meet the needs of the locality, and to offer aid in 
such a form that Japan's cooperation is really appreciated by 
the beneficiaries. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 24 March Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of Keidanren [Japan 
Federation of Economic Organizations], talked about economic 
prospects at a news conference on 23 March. He indicated: 
"While there are encouraging signs, my feeling is that economic 
recovery will probably come by the end of this year or in 
January 1995." 
  He also said: "There are still factors obstructing the 
recovery." He cited the following factors: 1) Land 
transactions remain stagnant, and the value of collateral 
remains low; 2) as long as Japan has a huge trade surplus, 
appreciation of the yen will continue; 3) corporate 
restructuring, for instance, in terms of capital investment and 
employment, has not been completed. 
  Hiraiwa further indicated a cautious view about talks on a 
further economic plunge. He said: "In March last year, it was 
said the recession had bottomed out, but there was a further dip 
in the April-June period. I think the situation has improved 
from last year, but we cannot yet say for sure the same thing 
will not happen this year." 
  [In a related 450-character report carried in its 24 March 
morning edition received via Nikkei Telecom Database, MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN also reports: "Hiraiwa commented on the International 
Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) nuclear inspections in North Korea 
at the same 23 March news conference. He said: `There should 
be several stages before imposing economic sanctions. As much 
as possible, it is necessary not to carry out sanctions and 
isolate North Korea.' He indicated that Japan should exert 
efforts in that direction. 
  "Hiraiwa further stated: `The DPRK's isolation will 
constitute a factor of uncertainty in world stability and peace. 
Through its traditional contacts, Japan should work to help 
North Korea adapt to the international community. At the same 
time, North Korea should also exert efforts to adapt to the 
international community.' 
  "Regarding economic sanctions, Hiraiwa said: `If that 
becomes necessary, it would be advisable to cooperate with other 
countries through the United Nations.'"]

  [Text] While the possibility of sanctions against the DPRK 
(North Korea) is becoming the focal point of the UN policy 
concerning that nation's alleged nuclear development program, 
the coalition parties are demonstrating discord over Japan's 
North Korea policy. The disparity in the parties' North Korean 
policies is likely to become a sensitive issue for the coalition 
government. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is calling for following 
the 
international community if the UN Security Council [UNSC] 
decides on sanctions against North Korea. But some quarters in 
the coalition government are demonstrating a negative attitude 
toward "sanctions." In addition to the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan [SDPJ], which has long taken a pro-DPRK stand, some 
conservative coalition leaders such as Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura and hajime Ishii of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], chairman of the lower house Special Committee on 
Political Reform, are prudent on this issue because they have 
been leading efforts to normalize Japan-DPRK relations. 
  In a 22 March news conference, SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama expressed a prudent attitude toward a hardline policy 
against North Korea in stressing the need for a settlement of 
the nuclear issue through peaceful talks. He said: "The issue 
must be settled between the United States and North Korea, for 
as long as this is a possibility. I think we should do 
everything we can to reach a settlement through consultations, 
rather than through immediate sanctions." 
  In contrast, Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa said 
on 
22 March: "In line with the concept of the Constitution, Japan 
must secure its own peace, security, and presence under the 
global peace realized by the UN centrism. If we do not take 
actions according to this principle, the international community 
will not trust Japan." Thus, Ozawa noted his policy of 
following the UN decision even if it is an embargo. 
  Senior Shinseito officials are expressing concern about the 
internal discord in the coalition, saying, "We are not sure if 
the coalition can reach an accord when economic sanctions 
against North Korea become inevitable." However, a senior 
Komeito official is optimistic about this and says that the 
coalition parties will eventually get together on this issue. He 
noted, "Some SDPJ members will actually oppose sanctions against 
North Korea, but the party cannot withdraw from the coalition 
over this particular issue." 
  The coalition parties, however, have not had thorough 
internal discussions on their courses of action on the policy 
toward the DPRK. They will face difficult choices when 
"sanctions" become a reality.

  [Text] The contents of the draft import- and 
investment-promotion measures which will make up the core of the 
general foreign economic measures to be finalized by the end of 
this month have been revealed. A feature of the measures is 
that an "import expansion action plan" (provisional name) needs 
to be prepared every year and that the 1994 plan will call for 
assisting foreign companies wanting to sell to Japan, improving 
import facilities, and promoting imports of particular products 
such as prefabricated housing and automobiles, the imports of 
which can grow large. The government wants to make its 
announcement of voluntary actions to expand imports not only a 
step toward reducing the trade surplus but also an opportunity 
to resume Japanese-U.S. economic consultations. 
  The general foreign economic measures are composed of four 
categories of projects -- macroeconomic policies including tax 
cuts, and deregulation that would lead to market liberalization; 
the promotion of imports and foreign investment; the 
strengthening of competition; and the improved transparency of 
government procurement -- and the three priority areas of the 
economic framework talks, i.e., government procurement of 
medical equipment and telecommunications, automobiles and auto 
parts, and insurance. These measures will be announced next week. 
  The promotion of imports and foreign investment, along with 
the macroeconomic measures and deregulation, will become the 
selling point of the measures. At a trade conference (chaired 
by Prime Minister Hosokawa) meeting held last October, the 
government decided on a basic policy of promoting imports. As 
such, the import expansion action plans to be prepared from 1994 
will become detailed plans to implement this policy. 
  The main points of the action plan to be prepared for 1994 
are to be: 1) the deregulation of imports and foreign 
investment; 2) assistance for sales to Japan by foreign 
companies; 3) the expansion of consumer demand for imports; 4) 
the improvement of import facilities; and 5) the promotion of 
imports of specific products.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 24 March Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Sadayuki Hayashi, newly named deputy vice minister 
of foreign affairs (in charge of economic issues), granted an 
interview to a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter on 23 March. In 
the interview, Hayashi touched on a package of external economic 
measures to be compiled by the government by the end of this 
month, and said: "It is difficult to come up with macro 
economic measures because there are various limitations in this 
field. I do not think surprising measures will be included in 
the package." Thus he indicated that, this time, the government 
would not spell out drastic measures such as a plan to continue 
tax cuts from 1995 onward. Regarding the resumption of 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, Hayashi said: "It seems to 
be difficult."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Politicians Should Open Their Eyes To View the </F>
World -- Thinking About Japan-U.S. Relations"] 
  [Text] During his recent visit to Japan, U.S. State 
Secretary Warren Christopher used the words, "political risk," a 
number of times. He used the words in a context in which he 
stressed how U.S. President Bill Clinton has successfully 
achieved important tasks, such as the enactment of NAFTA, 
despite great political obstacles. Apparently, Christopher has 
tacitly called on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to similarly 
take "political risk" in exercising leadership. 
  One of the greatest reasons for the breakdown in the 
Japan-U.S. summit talks held last month is said to be that the 
United States was disappointed that Japan would implement income 
tax cuts -- aimed at boosting its domestic demand -- strictly 
for one year only. 
  In some quarters of the ruling coalition parties, voices can 
now be heard saying that "the prime minister should have said 
income tax cuts would be carried out not for only one year, but 
for three years." If he had an accurate grasp of the situation, 
the prime minister, as the highest-ranking official in charge of 
Japanese politics, certainly should have been able to express 
his "determination" to carry this out. This, then, must be what 
it means to take "political risk." 
  Regarding political reform, Prime Minister Hosokawa said 
immediately after his inauguration that he would "take political 
responsibility if it cannot be carried out by the year-end." In 
this regard, there seems to be a considerable gap in his 
political stance then and the stance he is currently taking. 
  However, it is also true that should the prime minister have 
made such a remark, there would again have been great turmoil 
within the ruling coalition government. This is because 
regarding the consumption tax issue in particular, the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which is the largest among the 
ruling coalition parties, would persist in expressing 
"opposition" to it, considering it wholly as a domestic issue -- 
and as a rather short-sighted election campaign slogan, at that. 
  Even now, there are "opposition" headquarters against the 
consumption tax set up at the SDPJ headquarters and its local 
chapters. Regarding consultations among the ruling coalition 
parties on tax system reforms, circumstances are such that in 
some quarters of the SDPJ, there have emerged voices expressing 
pessimism about implementation of tax system reforms by the end 
of the year. The party thus fails to see such matters in 
relation to Japan-U.S. ties. 
  Recently, the official party organ of the SDPJ carried a 
statement by Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic 
Planning Agency, who said: "During the days when the SDPJ was an 
opposition party, it would suffice, in many aspects, for the 
party to chant the line, `Japan-U.S. relations are the most 
important among bilateral relations.' Now, that is not enough." 
  However, the SDPJ never even chanted such a "line" when it 
was an opposition party. What it has historically advocated was 
a "pro-Soviet, anti-U.S." policy. Even now, the party still has 
not formally withdrawn its opposition to the Japan-U.S. Security 
Treaty. It remains indifferent to such concerns as that 
deteriorated economic relations could eventually affect security 
ties. 
  At a time when the post-Cold War situation continues to 
drift, political parties -- regardless of whether they be ruling 
or opposition parties -- bear the responsibility to decide on 
policies and determine the course of their political action, not 
looking only at domestic affairs, but also opening their eyes to 
view the rest of the world. 
  The Diet, which, under normal conditions, should be 
conducting serious deliberations toward restoring strained 
relations with the United States, has been unable to hold budget 
committee meetings. This situation is nearly tantamount to 
political parties' failing to fulfill their responsibilities. 
  In view of the upcoming July Naples summit, the government 
is 
currently hastening compilation of a package of measures to 
appease the United States. However, voices have emerged 
pointing out that Prime Minister Hosokawa seems to have little 
part in the process. It is believed the prime minister should 
come forward and fulfill the responsibilities which accompany 
his saying "no" at the Japan-U.S. summit meeting.

  [Text] As can be seen in the Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] proposal to merge parliamentary groups with the Japan New 
Party [JNP], some coalition parties are moving positively toward 
the second stage of political party realignment. Komeito, which 
has led the moves together with Shinseito, has recently been 
quiet on the issue. Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa is 
gradually shifting his emphasis to partnership with the JNP, 
while maintaining friendly ties with Komeito. Other coalition 
parties are keeping their distance from Komeito. As a result 
Komeito members are becoming anxious about their party's 
isolation in the coalition government. 
  Executives of Shinseito, JNP, and the Democratic Socialist 
Party [DSP] met on the evening of 17 March and reconfirmed their 
accord to form a "new party." Komeito, however, did not join 
the meeting. This looked somewhat odd because Komeito had been 
the most enthusiastic about "new party" proposal. 
  After the dispute over Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
introduction of a public welfare tax, the Soka Gakkai, a 
Buddhist group which serves as Komeito's primary sponsor, 
reportedly expressed concern that an alliance between Ozawa and 
Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa gave the public a 
strong impression of collusion on the issue. Komeito members 
also complained that the "Shinseito-Komeito" initiative was an 
attempt to reshuffle the cabinet. 
  It seems Ichikawa is doing his best not to advertise his 
links with Ozawa for the time being. Komeito will probably 
watch merger talks between Shinseito and the JNP, and decide on 
its response depending on how the issue develops. 
  Toshio Yamaguchi, an independent lower house member who left 
the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], recently met Ichikawa to 
urge that he have positive exchanges with other parties. 
  Ichikawa reportedly replied: "If I take action right now, 
people will again criticize the Ozawa-Ichikawa link."

<F P=106> [Interview with Sakigake Secretary General Hiroyuki Sonoda </F>
by TOKYO SHIMBUN correspndents Koichi Obata and Uichiro Oshima; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] [TOKYO SHIMBUN] How do you view the rapid approach 
to each other by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Japan New 
Party [JNP], which are aiming to form a major parliamentary 
group and a new political party? 
  [Sonoda] Their rapid approach is related to a realignment of 
political parties. It is a move to defeat the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in the next election. The LDP 
remains a powerful political force. Our party understands and 
agrees with their intentions to defeat the LDP in the next 
election. If the two parties are to form a major parliamentary 
group only for the purpose of cooperating with each other in the 
next election and in running the Diet, our party cannot go along 
with them. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Then, are you against forming a new 
political 
party? 
  [Sonoda] If attempts are made to realign political parties 
to 
create a new party to counter the LDP with differing political 
beliefs, policies, and political tactics being left 
uncoordinated, this would merely be done to attain a majority. 
The plan for a major parliamentary group smacks of a new 
political party. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Your party has maintained an engagement-type 
relationship with the Japan New Party. How will your party 
proceed with its dialogue with that party? 
  [Sonoda] If the two parties are to form a major 
parliamentary 
group to cooperate with each other in the next election and in 
running the Diet after merging themselves into one party, our 
party is willing to discuss various matters with the JNP. 
However, the formation of a major parliamentary group is 
different from the creation of a party. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Will the engagement between your party and 
the JNP be broken off? 
  [Sonoda] Prime Minister Hosokawa and the JNP have said that 
the engagement will not be broken off. It is true that the 
prime minister is wary of the JNP. Both Sakigake [Harbinger] 
and the JNP have agreed to merge into one party to contest the 
next election and to practice politics to enact reforms. My 
understanding is that the time has come for the two parties to 
merge into one party. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] The prime minister, however, shows no 
intention of calling for a shift from an "engagement" to a 
"marriage." 
  [Sonoda] I do not know about that. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] The relationship between the prime minister 
and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura has worsened. Would you 
comment on this? 
  [Sonoda] Although you may not believe me, their relationship 
is nearly back to normal. While the prime minister is a 
single-minded man, Mr. Takemura is an obedient man who does his 
best if asked to by the prime minister. It once was the case 
that they rarely met at the Prime Minister's Official Residence 
for discussions, but I assume that such a situation no longer is 
the case. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Shinseito appears to want to forge an 
alliance with Sakigake or the LDP. What do you think? 
  [Sonoda] If Shinseito is suspected of making contacts as a 
party with the LDP, this is incorrect and a misunderstanding. 
There have been only personal contacts. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] A prerequisite for a realignment of the 
political parties is that not only the ruling coalition parties 
but also the LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] 
must change themselves. 
  [Sonoda] If there is no such prerequisite, it would be 
impossible to realign the political parties. It is also 
impossible to form a genuinely new political group only months 
after the LDP-SDPJ system, which existed for a long time, has 
been torn down. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Would you explain Sakigake's strategy for a 
realignment of the political parties? 
  [Sonoda] Power games within the ruling coalition parties are 
inevitable. There are some people in the LDP and the SDPJ who 
can move toward realigning the political parties. Under present 
circumstances, however, they cannot make such moves. Although 
it is desirable to realign the political parties, the ruling 
coalition parties have to implement policies every day and to 
attach more importance to holding their coalition together than 
to realigning the political parties. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Will a realignment of the political parties 
definitely take place? 
  [Sonoda] Now that a single-seat constituency system has been 
adopted for the House of Representatives, in the end, the 
current political parties will be merged into two political 
forces. Therefore, our party is conscious of the realignment, 
but it believes that now is not the time for a realignment.

<F P=106> [Interview with JNP Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka by </F>
TOKYO SHIMBUN correspondents Koichi Obata and Uichiro Oshima; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Does the Japan New Party [JNP] 
intend to form a parliamentary group with Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] by late April, as planned? 
  [Matsuoka] In a way, I cannot say exactly when that might 
happen until the draft budget for the next fiscal year has been 
finalized, but we must not delay this matter. Even if the upper 
and lower house elections are not held simultaneously, we feel 
that we must be prepared to contest next summer's upper house 
election and the next lower house general election as a single 
set of elections. We do not have very much time. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] It was Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa who 
originally proposed the formation of a large parliamentary group 
composed of all the ruling coalition parties. How do you feel 
about this? 
  [Matsuoka] The prime minister has clearly indicated that the 
plan is geared toward the next election. The Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] still fares strongly in local districts. The battle 
between the coalition alliance and the LDP is a battle between 
reformists and the forces of the old system. Therefore, 
reformist-minded political parties (of the coalition alliance) 
must unite to carry on this battle. Because this is just about 
to happen, there is no time to argue about (regrouping parties 
into) a bipolar or tripolar structure. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Under the circumstances in which the Diet is 
remaining idle and deliberations on the budget cannot begin, 
complaints have been raised even by some members of the ruling 
coalition parties against stepping up moves toward a political 
realignment. How do you feel about this? 
  [Matsuoka] We have not thrown the "ball." Neither has the 
prime minister. The proposed formation of a parliamentary group 
is... well, a "ball" thrown at us by Shinseito. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What kind of new party do you envision after 
the formation of a large parliamentary group? 
  [Matsuoka] It can be expected to take various forms, because 
there will be a complex integration of beliefs about democracy, 
the Constitution, and other matters. However, I doubt whether 
we should rush to form a new party. What is necessary is to 
first completely destroy the old system. In addition, it is 
necessary for the time being to improve ways to steer the Diet, 
rather than to try to form a large parliamentary group. Should 
the JNP, Sakigake [Harbinger], and Shinseito unite, they would 
turn into a powerful force of about 120 members. We are now 
faced with difficult tasks, including a reform of the tax 
system. Unless the government has centripetal force -- just as 
in the days when the Tanaka faction, which consisted of over a 
hundred-odd members, was formed under the LDP -- the Diet cannot 
function properly. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] The JNP and Sakigake have already formed a 
parliamentary group. What will happen to your party's ties with 
Sakigake? 
  [Matsuoka] Prime Minister Hosokawa has suffered very much 
(in 
connection with the national welfare tax and cabinet reshuffle 
issues) as a result of the "ball" thrown by Sakigake's Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura (head of Sakigake). If 
relations between Hosokawa and Takemura are referred to as an 
"engagement," Takemura should devote himself to playing the role 
of a housewife and unite his heart with that of the prime 
minister at their "household," which is the Prime Minister's 
Official Residence. Takemura, however, failed at this. 
Sakigake is more to blame for the changed situation (the 
deterioration in relations) as it exists now. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is it no longer possible to restore the 
damaged relations with Sakigake? 
  [Matsuoka] Sakigake used to be a group of LDP members who 
were dedicated to carrying out political reform. They also 
share a common political ideology with members of the JNP. 
However, what is wrong with them is that they tend to seek a 
joining of hands with the LDP. The JNP will absolutely never 
ally itself with the LDP. In this respect, Shinseito and the JNP 
are in agreement. However, Shinseito continues to drag on the 
employment of the old system's political style. The JNP can 
still continue to act as a mediator between Sakigake and 
Shinseito. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is it possible to conceive of forming a 
parliamentary group consisting of these three new political 
parties? 
  [Matsuoka] That depends on how members of Sakigake perceive 
this new political era. We would like them to look back and 
think calmly. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Do you have any concern about the 
possibility 
of the JNP becoming a cut field of grass [kusakari-ba -- 
recruiting ground] for other parties of the ruling coalition? 
  [Matsuoka] The term "cut field of grass" itself is 
old-fashioned and is reminiscent of the old system. The JNP 
just has to further strengthen its own identity and continue 
associating with other parties.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 23 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs that the State Great Hural 
session discussed the issue about making amendments and 
additions in the law on elections. This issue has been 
submitted to the Parliament session by the President of Mongolia 
P. Ochirbat. The session decided to discuss the issue about 
making amendments in the law on elections in autumn and set up a 
working group with participation of the representatives of all 
political parties in the Parliament for elaboration of the draft 
law. The Parliament spring session considered the draft 
resolution on guarantee of propaganda of activity of the State 
Great Hural through the state mass media. The session 
recognized that different parties and forces are able to 
propagandize their activity in the central press, that is why it 
is not necessary to adopt a special resolution. The newspaper 
informs that the State Great Hural session set to consideration 
of the rules of the research center attached to the Parliament. 
  As the newspaper informs, held [words indistinct] the second 
session of the Congress of the Mongolian Social Democratic 
Party. The session has discussed the country's political 
situation and issued the statement on this issue. The session 
has released from the duties of the chairman of the Social 
Democratic Party B. Batwayar at his own request, and expressed 
thanks to him for the work done. 
  R. Gonchigdorj was elected the chairman of the Mongolian 
Social Democratic Party, N. Altanhuyag and L. Byambajargal were 
elected the vice chairmen. Approved was the composition of the 
political council of the party consisting of 21 members. 
  In an interview with the newspaper correspondent the new 
chairman of the Social Democratic Party, the State Great Hural 
member R. Gonchigdorj notes that as a party, having seats in the 
Parliament, the Social Democrats in cooperation with the 
representatives of the Mongolian National Democratic Party will 
actively work for perfection of the Parliament activity in 
accordance with the ideas and principles of the constitution. 
As R. Gonchigdorj notes, the representatives of the opposition 
parties in the Parliament are intending to exercise control over 
fulfillment by the Parliament and the government of their 
engagements undertaken in the pre-election programme of the 
Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, which have got the 
majority of votes of electors. R. Gonchigdorj expresses a 
negative opinion about the government activity. 
  The government newspaper "DZASGIYN GADZRYN MEUEE", 
commenting 
the work of the State Great Hural spring session, points out to 
importance of adoption by the session of the law on regulation 
of currency. In the newspaper's view, the new law is of great 
importance for regulation of mutual relations of banks and 
economic units, realization of the currency policy and the state 
control in this sphere. 
  One of the ardent points, to which a common attention should 
be directed, as the newspaper considers, is preparation and 
successful carrying out of the spring sowing works. The 
newspaper points out to the delay of these works because of the 
lack of financial means, expresses anxiety apropos of constant 
drop in the last years of growing of foeder crois [preceding two 
words as received], which will drop again also in the current 
year. The newspaper points out to necessity of effective use of 
credits granted by the Asian Development Bank. 
  The newspaper informs that in Mongolia in the current year 
for the fourth time the Moslem spring holiday "Nauryz" is being 
celebrated. This holiday is especially widely celebrated by the 
Khazakh population of Mongolia. 
  As the newspaper informs, last week the holiday festivities 
on the occasion of "Nauryz" have been organized at the National 
Institute of Culture and Recreation. 
  The newspaper publishes the government resolution on 
measures 
on preparation for transition of dwelling to market relations. 
In the supplement to the resolution published is the working 
programme on transition of dwelling to market relations in the 
period 1994-[year indistinct]. The newspaper publishes also the 
government resolution on measures on realization of the law on 
foreign investments.

monthly of credits interests of commercial banks directed to 
development of the sector of small and medium enterprises 
constitute for the present 8-15 percent, which is by almost 10 
percent lower than in the last year. 15 commercial banks of 
Mongolia by the beginning of March have granted to economic 
units credits worth 39 billion tugriks, which is by 2.4 percent 
higher than in February. The credits to economic units and 
enterprises of the state sector constituted 15 billion tugriks, 
or by 12 percent lower then in the last months. The credits to 
the private sector have increased and constituted 23 billion 
tugriks.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of remarks by ROK Ambassador to Japan Kong </F>
No-myong from an interview with ASAHI SHIMBUN editorial writer 
Oki Odakawa; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Cultural Exchanges 
  Nearly a year has passed since I was assigned here. I have 
toured many places in Japan, and I have been able to see for 
myself where ROK-Japan relations are close and where they remain 
not close. 
  There have been two big events of misfortune in relations 
between the countries -- the war of 1592-97 and the 36 years of 
colonial rule [1909-45]. It is regrettable that these 
unfortunate historical events are still having their effects. 
Historical events do not disappear completely but, given deep 
mutual understanding, they can in fact beget strong relations of 
friendship and cooperation. 
  Last year, about 2.6 million people visited each other's 
country, and cultural exchanges are extensive. In the past, the 
ROK Government put restraints on such things as Japanese 
entertainment films and pop songs because it was thought that 
these would adversely affect Korean society. The new government 
has so far taken the position of opening up such types of 
popular culture step by step, in view of the past events 
concerning Japan. The question -- as it always has been -- is 
that of when [to open up completely]. 
  Next year it will be 50 years since the ROK became 
independent, and 30 years since ROK-Japanese relations were 
normalized. Maybe the time has come to think specifically about 
the timing of lifting the bans, to enable the new governments of 
the two nations to solidify their friendly, cooperative 
relations. There are plans for the ROK-Japanese production of 
movies, and there are also plans to show Korean movies in Japan. 
Starting slow and then moving more quickly -- that is the way 
we should do it. It is important that in the meantime the 
people of both nations resolve, one by one, the issues that are 
impeding their cultural exchanges. 
<H5>  Economic Relations </H5>
  The removal of the trade imbalance is a major pending issue. 
South Korea had a $8.4 billion trade deficit with Japan last 
year, and its accumulated deficit with Japan increased to $82.6 
billion. 
  As a way of remedying the problem, Korea called on Japan to 
implement "political considerations," for instance by removing 
tariff and nontariff barriers on Korean products and by making 
more technologies available to Korea. But such remedies lacked 
practicality and thus only helped to complicate the two 
countries' relations. 
  Consequently, the new government is trying to review this 
problem from the viewpoint of "economic logic." There is also a 
desire to create an atmosphere which can attract Japanese 
companies possessing technology to invest in the country. What 
we want to do is to improve on the system so that the 
technologies of South Korea and Japan can be combined in 
promoting industries. 
  Technical training carried out for small and medium 
enterprises based on the action plans that came out of the 1992 
ROK-Japanese summit has been effective. 
  But Japan needs to create conditions that will enable the 
Japanese market to import more Korean goods. Japan's tariffs on 
Korean products are very low. Thus, it can be said that the 
outer walls have been taken down but that the problem now lies 
with the inner walls. 
  For instance, even if a Korean company wants to sell 
Korean-made vehicles to Japan, the former government officials 
who now lead Japanese industry would not accept them. The 
Japanese Government itself is making efforts to deal with the 
situation by implementing a complaint arbitration system, but 
the system is not working well. We will do some soul-searching 
on our part and will make efforts to increase our exports to 
Japan, but unless Japan takes action to take down the inner 
walls by easing controls on foreign products, the problem really 
cannot be solved. 
<H5>  War Reparations </H5>
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remark specifically and 
clearly admitting an "act of aggression" [Japan's invasion of 
other countries in World War II] is considered refreshing and 
has been highly appreciated [in South Korea]. 
  As for the issue of Army comfort women, President Kim 
Yong-sam takes the position of "not seeking financial 
compensation from Japan," and the [Korean] government is 
providing payments to aid the lives of these people. The ROK 
Government will not make any further requests with respect to 
this issue, but neither is Japan coming up with any specific 
measures to deal with the matter. 
  Where the question of postwar reparations is concerned, 
there are many other pending issues, such as assistance to South 
Koreans left in Sakhalin and suits filed against the Japanese 
Government by South Korean residents in Japan who were wounded 
while serving in the Japanese Army. To resolve these, there is 
no other way but for the two countries to come together and 
tackle the issues sincerely and steadily within the framework of 
the ROK-Japanese treaty. 
  It is important to learn from history if we do not want to 
repeat the mistakes of the past. It would be desirable to 
entrust private-sector specialists from the two countries with 
the work of preparing schools' history textbooks which are not 
biased and to encourage them to cooperate in studies otherwise. 
  In an Independence Day speech, President Kim said something 
different from what past presidents had said. The president 
said, "We must not cling to the emotions of past days. The 
country must have confidence and pride in itself, and must 
cooperate and compete with Japan in an open and frank manner." 
  What is demanded is a perspective on how Japan and South 
Korea, which have common values with respect to a free democracy 
and a market economy, should cooperate in contributing to the 
coexistence and coprosperity of East Asia and the world in the 
future. 
  Japan is about to reach a big turning point in foreign 
relations, by wanting to become a permanent member of the UN 
Security Council, for example. In doing so, Japan must first of 
all make its connections with its nearest neighbor, South Korea, 
sturdier. Otherwise, Japan's dealings with the other nations of 
Asia will not go smoothly, either. Japan is asked to think 
clearly about the roles appropriate for it as a great nation. 
That will better enable Japan's neighbors to formulate a policy 
toward it. 
<H5>  North Korean Nuclear Issue </H5>
  We are disappointed by the actions of North Korea (DPRK) on 
the nuclear issue. 
  It is beneficial for that country itself and desirable for 
the peace and stability of East Asia for North Korea to clear up 
the nuclear issue and to behave as a responsible member of the 
international community. I think that the North -- which has so 
many issues on its plate, such as the problems of maintaining 
its political system and of reconstructing its economy -- is 
using the nuclear issue as a trump card. There is the question 
of how much longer the international community can put up with 
all of this. The situation is getting precarious. As far as 
South Korea is concerned, it has no other choice but to act 
according to strict principles. 
  President Kim Yong-sam called for a South-North summit, in 
hoping to find a solution to the nuclear issue. If the summit 
becomes a reality, and if agreements made at the summit are 
implemented, mutual trust will grow, and this can develop into 
South-North exchanges and economic cooperation. 
  For that to happen, it is important that the North actively 
tackle the task of fulfilling the matters that have been agreed 
on at the meetings of U.S.-DPRK senior officials. The North 
should recognize fully that if it plays games with the United 
States for too long, the latter's patience will wear out.

  [Text] Members of the armed organizations in the jungle 
have been laying mines on railway lines, roads, and sidewalks 
with the intent to destroy them and to kill and maim the people 
who want to live peacefully. They are also hindering and 
disturbing smooth and secure transportation as well as local 
tranquility. 
  At about 1600 on 2 March, Maung Tar Htay, the 19-year-old 
son 
of U Aye Myint Lwin of the village of Kyaukpya, Kyaikto 
Township, stepped on an antipersonnel mine laid by members of 
the Karen armed organization in the jungle while he was 
returning to Kyaukpya from the fields. He lost his toes in the 
accident. The responsible personnel took him to Kyaikto 
Hospital for treatment.

  [Text] Damascus, 23 Mar (SANA)--Pak Di-chun [name as 
received], ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea to Damascus, has said his country has decided not to send 
its delegation to the third round of Korean-U.S. negotiations. 
Nor will it continue to consider itself bound by its 
obligations to the International Atomic Energy Authority [IAEA]. 
  In a statement to a SANA correspondent, the ambassador said 
this follows the distortion by the United States and the IAEA of 
the results of the recent inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
This was used as a pretext to pressure the DPRK. 
  He said his government took this measure based on the 
principles contained in the Korean-U.S. agreement reached in New 
York on 25 February 1994 which stipulate a simultaneous move on 
both sides to secure the full implementation of this agreement. 
  He said it is his government's firm and continuous position 
not to abide by its pledges to the United States as long as the 
latter is breaking its pledges. 
  The Korean ambassador noted that the United States resorted 
to distorting and fabricating the issue dealing with the IAEA's 
inspection. It used it as an excuse to resume joint military 
maneuvers with South Korea and to threaten the use of force to 
exert pressure against the Korean Government. Moreover, it 
reveals a U.S. intention to have the UN Security Council impose 
sanctions on his country. He said the United States should make 
an accurate and responsible assessment of the current situation. 
  The ambassador expressed his deep appreciation of the 
Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for supporting his 
government's just and reasonable stand toward the nuclear issue.

  [Text] According to reports, the United States is 
deliberately driving the situation of the Korean peninsula to a 
war phase [kyehoekchoguro chosonbandoui chongserul chonjaeng 
kungmyonero moragago issumnida] after rupturing the DPRK-U.S. 
talks. 
  As has been learned, the United States completely turned 
over 
[chonmyon twijibo opko] the agreement reached at the New York 
DPRK-U.S. contact and broke up [patansikigo] the third round of 
the DPRK-U.S. talks. Nevertheless, the United States poses open 
[nogolhwa] military threats and pressure against us under unjust 
pretexts, shifting the responsibility for the rupture of the 
talks to us. 
  U.S. President Clinton made a very provocative order [maeu 
tobalchogin myongnyong] to deploy 192 Patriot missiles in South 
Korea as soon as the DPRK-U.S. talks came to a rupture, as 
though he had been waiting for it. 
  The U.S. Department of Defense said that a Patriot missile 
battalion with some 40 missile launching ramps and 850 soldiers 
was going to move from Texas, the United States, to South Korea, 
according to the order. The U.S. measure of deploying Patriot 
missiles in South Korea is threatening and extremely agitating 
[simhi chaguk]. It is a kind of declaration of overall 
confrontation with us [urie taehan ilchongui chonmyon taegyol 
sonon], a declaration of war. 
  According to the U.S. newspaper WASHINGTON POST dated 22 
March, the U.S. Administration is plotting a scheme to take 
next-stage military steps against us [urirul pandaehanun taum 
tangyeui kunsajok chochidurul chwiharyogo hoekchukhago 
issumnida]. 
  Following the decision to deploy Patriot missiles, the U.S. 
Administration is trying to dispatch additional U.S. military 
forces to South Korea, to move and deploy U.S. aircraft carriers 
along the coastline of the Korean peninsula, and to arm the U.S. 
Forces in South Korea and the South Korean puppet Army with new 
military equipment. 
  The British newspaper EVENING STANDARD reported that a U.S. 
naval fleet with 30 naval vessels was approaching an area where 
it can reach our country's coast in 24 hours. This fleet has 
two mobile aircraft carrier units and landing operations forces, 
including the Marine Corps, aboard. 
  According to Japan's MAINICHI SHIMBUN dated 19 March, the 
U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Carl Vinson lately 
departed from Japan's Yokosuka Port with six escort ships and is 
maintaining a mobile posture heading toward the Korean peninsula. 
  Prior to this, the U.S. aircraft carrier Independence led by 
the Mobile Bay, an Aegis missile cruiser; (?Bainbridge), a 
guided missile cruiser; and two frigates had called at Port 
Yokosuka. They are also preparing against a possible case by 
standing by within the reach of the Korean peninsula. 
  Meanwhile, the U.S. warmongers are openly disclosing its 
plot 
to resume the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise, and the 
bellicose remarks on the Team Spirit continue to resound from 
the Congress. 
  The Democratic whip leader in the House of Representatives 
and the Republican whip leader in the Senate, in an interview 
with NBC Television, raved that the United States should resume 
the Team Spirit joint military exercise so as to impose pressure 
on North Korea by actually carrying it out. 
  We cannot but say such ill-boding military moves, containing 
the danger of a war provocation, will only bring out vigilance 
[undanghan kyonggaesim].

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- High-placed 
politicians of the United States are now getting frenzied in the 
kickup for pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea, according to a report from Washington. 
  Democratic leader of whip in the House of Representatives 
Richard Gephardt said the United States must deploy Patriot 
missiles in South Korea, resume the "Team Spirit" nuclear war 
exercises and additionally dispatch U.S. troops to South Korea. 
Republican leader of whip in the Senate Robert Dole also made 
such remarks, crying for "a deliberation of economic sanctions 
against North Korea." 
  Meanwhile, U.S. State Secretary Christopher, in his 
interview 
with CBS, openly revealed the intention to put pressure on the 
DPRK by abusing "a resolution of the United Nations" and thus 
bring the situation of the Korean peninsula to a hopeless phase. 
  All this clearly indicates that the U.S. hardline 
conservatives are invariably pursuing the reckless policy of 
isolating and stifling the DPRK. 
  Any pressure and sanctions, however, can never work with the 
DPRK. The Korean people value peace. But, they will not 
tolerate anyone who dares infringe upon the nation's sovereignty 
and dignity. 
  The U.S. war-thirsty elements would be well advised to stop 
running rashly, clearly knowing of the DPRK where the leader, 
the party and the popular masses are united in one mind.

<F P=106> ["MINJU CHOSON Slams Nuclear Threat of U.S. Military"--KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- The U.S. military 
recently discussed the "possibility of the use of nuclear 
weapons" allegedly to "check" the chemical and biological weapon 
"attack" from non-nuclear states. 
  Branding this as an unpardonable crime, a MINJU CHOSON 
analyst today says: 
  The open argument for the "possibility of the use of nuclear 
weapons" by the U.S. military contradicts the principle of the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  The NPT itself is an inequitable treaty favorable only for 
the nuclear-weapon states. Moreover, the United States, a 
nuclear power, is presenting nuclear threat to non-nuclear 
states, frequently violating the NPT, which it signed. 
  Its nuclear threat still remains and is getting more 
undisguised today after the end of the Cold War, not to speak of 
the Cold War era. 
  The United States is intensifying nuclear threat to the 
DPRK, 
a non-nuclear and peaceful state. Although the United States in 
its joint statement with the DPRK in June last year committed 
itself not to use force of arms including nuclear weapons or 
pose a threat, it has never ceased nuclear blackmail to the DPRK 
with nuclear war exercises targeted against it. 
  The U.S. is increasing its nuclear threat to the DPRK by 
manipulating even the International Atomic Energy Agency. It 
has reversed the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. 
contact in New York and is going to stage the Team Spirit 94 
joint military maneuvers, a nuclear war game against the DPRK. 
  The United States is a nuclear war criminal who has already 
imposed nuclear disaster on humanity. 
  The United States must clearly see the demand of the times 
and the desire of the world people and act with discretion.

<F P=106> ["Hanminjon Central Committee Issues Detailed Report on War </F>
Provocation Moves of U.S. Imperialists and S. Korean 
authorities" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee 
of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) 
recently published a "Detailed Report on the War Crisis on the 
Korean Peninsula" concerning the ever more open war provocation 
moves of the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam group 
against the North, according to the Seoul-based Radio Voice of 
National Salvation. 
  Recalling that the U.S. imperialists have already worked out 
a war scenario to cope with a "case of emergency" on the Korean 
peninsula under the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear issue" 
and abruptly turned toward the provocation of an adventurous war 
against the North, the detailed report says: 
  WASHINGTON POST December 2, 1993 reported that in case a 
military conflict broke out on the Korean peninsula, the U.S. 
Forces would dispatch 500,000-strong reinforcements including 
six aircraft carriers, eleven army brigades equipped with heavy 
arms, thirty-four combat flying corps and four flying corps of 
bombers, which are nearly equivalent to a half of the U.S. 
combat units. This is the kernel of the war scenario written by 
the U.S. Defence Department to cope with a "case of emergency". 
The U.S. imperialists have designed even a U.S.-South 
Korea-Japan military command system, not to speak of a 
U.S.-South Korea operational command system to perform the above 
war scenario. 
  On September 27, 1993, former U.S. Defence Secretary Aspin, 
at his talks with the director-general of the Japan Defence 
Agency, decided on the involvement of the Japanese "Self-Defense 
Forces" in a war against the north of Korea and its share in it. 
On the basis of the "new military strategy", the United States 
is reorganising and reinforcing its huge aggression forces in 
and around the Korean peninsula. 
  The 95,000-strong U.S. Army, Naval fleets and Marine Corps 
stationed in South Korea and Japan are waiting for an order of 
action, while twelve of the thirteen U.S. aircraft carriers in 
the pacific are alerted as an "emergency relief force". The 
bellicose Kim Yong-sam group has completed the wartime system, 
while brutally cracking down on the struggle of the people for 
independence and democracy, peace and reunification with 
"civilian" fascist tyrany. 
  It formed a mobile army corps of the "ROK Army" allegedly 
for 
a "case of emergency" and revised the "system of examination for 
conscription" so it could draft any civilian into the army any 
time. And it has supplied to 3,800 officers of the "reserve 
forces" the same combat uniforms as those for the officers in 
active service, doubled the combat police force and modernised 
the combat equipment to be hurled into a war any time. 
  The U.S. imperialists plan of war against the North is near 
the danger line for going over to a real war. 
  If the reckless war provocation moves of the U.S. 
imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique against the 
North are not frustrated quickly, our fellow countrymen will 
suffer a disaster, the detailed report says, and stresses: 
  Anyone who opposes war and wishes to live in peace must rise 
up to shatter the war provocation moves against the North and 
expel the U.S. imperialist aggressors and overthrow the 
traitorous Kim Yong-sam group.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- Some 400 Japan-based 
U.S. fighters and fighter-bombers, assault planes, observation 
planes and reconnaissance planes of the U.S. Airforce present in 
South Korea and the South Korean puppet airforce staged 
provocative joint air war exercises in the sky above Chunchon, 
Pyongchang, Yongwol and Kongju of South Korea on March 21 and 
22, according to military sources. 
  Meanwhile, the South Korean puppet army on the same days 
fired more than 50 shells with tank guns at the area near the 
demilitarized zone from Paju county, and on the 22d fired some 
2,000 bullets with large-calibre machine-guns and automation 
rifles, advancing towards the Military Demarcation Line from 
Paju County and Yonchon County. 
  They launched exercises for surprise strike at the targets 
and disturbance in the rear, repeatedly dropping "commandoes" in 
Paju county on March 21 and 22. 
  The tension on the Korean peninsula is being screwed up by 
the war provocative moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South 
Korean puppets at a time when the schemes for "sanctions" 
against the DPRK are being hatched up in the arena of the United

  [Text] According to reports from Seoul, on 22 March, 
traitor Kim Yong-sam, who is madly engaged in war provocation 
maneuvers against the North [pukchim chonjaeng tobal chaektonge 
michyo nalttwigoinun], ordered the entire puppet armed forces to 
be put on alert [chonche kwoeroegun muryogi kyonggye taese-e 
turogalgosul chiryonghaessumnida]. The traitor called together 
the puppet defense minister, the chairman of the puppet Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, and the chiefs of the General Staff of the 
puppet Army, Navy, and Air Force in the presidential office to 
hold secret talks that day. He gave the above order while 
asking them to completely prepare for a northward invasion under 
the so-called cooperation system with the United States. 
  Prior to this, on 21 March, the traitor called a 
security-related ministers meeting at the presidential office to 
discuss a secrete scheme to invite outside forces to apply 
sanctions against the North [taebuk cheje-e oeserul kkuroduril 
kkung-kkung-irul kkumyossumnida]. 
  Meanwhile, the Joint Chiefs of Staff Headquarters ordered 
the 
entire puppet military forces to be on special alert on 23 
March. Accordingly, all puppet military officers and men are 
confined to their barracks, and all military officers have 
assumed a stand-by posture. 
  On 23 March, the U.S. ambassador to Seoul, the commander of 
the U.S. occupation forces in South Korea, the puppet defense 
minister, and the puppet foreign minister held a meeting in 
Seoul to plot a war conspiracy for northward invasion [pukchim 
chonjaeng moui]. According to reports, they intensively 
discussed the issue of introducing Patriot missiles in South 
Korea and resuming the Team Spirit joint military exercise, 
schemed about double-checking the South Korea-based U.S. 
occupation forces and the puppet armed forces readiness in war 
preparations [chongjaeng chunbi taeseul chaejomgom]. 
  The rascals' insane [mumohan] maneuvers are driving the 
situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war 
[chosonbandoui chongsenun chonjaeng chopkyongero chidaggo 
issumnida].

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam group 
called "a security-related ministers meeting" on March 21 to 
deliberate on "the policy toward the North" and adopt "a 
decision" to restart the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises 
and deploy Patriot missiles in a short time in South Korea after 
"consultation" with the United States. 
  Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today says this is 
virtually 
a declaration of total confrontation and a declaration of war 
against the North. 
  Noting that the situation of the Korean peninsula has been 
brought to a very dangerous phase by this reckless act of the 
puppets, the analyst says: 
  The projected resumption of the "Team Spirit," a test 
nuclear 
war for "a forestalling attack" on the North, and an early 
deployment of Patriots in South Korea are aimed at intentionally 
throwing a snag in the way of the solution to the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula, pushing ahead with war preparations in 
real earnest and, further, unleashing another war against the 
North. 
  In actuality, the puppet army forces were put on "emergency 
alert" shortly after the puppet rulers made the reckless 
provocative declaration. We cannot but take a very serious view 
of this. No matter how desperately such fools as Kim Yong-sam 
may try to overpower our people with something like the "Team 
Spirit" and Patriots, they can never frighten our people. 
  We will decisively cope with the South Korean puppets' moves 
of confrontation and war and resolutely defend the security of 
our socialist homeland and nation. 
  The United States had better look squarely at the reality, 
clearly mindful that it has nothing to get and beneficial, 
though it gives a shot in the arm to such fools as Kim Yong-sam. 
  It must act with discretion, knowing well of our people whom 
it is dealing with.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 23 March commentary: "Confrontation </F>
Commotions by Those Who Dig Their Own Graves"] 
  [Text] Traitor Kim Yong-sam of South Korea called a 
security-related ministers meeting at the presidential office on 
21 March to examine the policy toward the North and the security 
posture regarding the so-called nuclear issue of the North. 
  At the meeting the puppet traitor babbled that the nuclear 
issue of the North had reached an important point and gave an 
instruction to assume a complete military security posture 
against someone else's provocation 
  Shortly before the presidential office meeting, U.S. 
President Clinton sent a personal letter to puppet traitor Kim 
Yong-sam through the U.S. ambassador. The letter reportedly 
noted that the United States reaffirmed its security commitment 
to South Korea and stated that it would strengthen the South 
Korea-U.S. joint defense posture. 
  The puppets hastily convened a security-related ministers 
meeting and made a fuss as if they made a decision on an 
important issue. However, there is nothing new. They merely 
reiterated the resumption of the Team Spirit joint military 
exercise and the early deployment of Patriot missiles in 
consultation with the United States, their master. 
  The puppets' fuss at the presidential office is a reckless 
act to deliberately bring the situation to the phase of war 
after breaking up [kyollyol] the contact of working-level 
delegates for the exchange of top-level special envoys between 
the North and South. 
  The puppets themselves broke up the contact of working-level 
delegates for the exchange of special envoys, hastily convened 
what is called a security-related ministers meeting as inspired 
by the United States, and made some decisions for confrontation 
with us. We cannot overlook the fact that these maneuvers by the 
puppets can destroy [pagoe] peace on the Korean peninsula and 
inflict a nuclear catastrophe on the nation. 
  In consultation with the United States, the Kim Yong-sam 
ring 
declared they would resume the Team Spirit joint military 
exercise against us, its fellow countrymen, and deploy Patriot 
missiles in a short time. This clearly shows the rascals 
[nomdul] are dirty national traitors who seek a way out in 
harming their fellow countrymen in collusion with outside 
forces. The puppets' act shows their antinational colors as 
those who break up North-South dialogue, harm their fellow 
countrymen in collusion with outside forces, play a role in 
destroying the DPRK-U.S. talks [chomihoedamui pagoe chagyongul 
hago], and bring North-South relations to an unpredictable phase 
of confrontation. 
  The reality again shows that if the Kim Yong-sam ring is 
left 
untouched, no dialogue or peace on the Korean peninsula can be 
achieved, but only confrontation and a catastrophe of nuclear 
war will result. 
  As we have declared time and again, we are fully prepared to 
answer dialogue with dialogue and war with war. 
  We are not afraid [gomnalgussi opta] even if the South 
Korean 
puppets resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise and 
deploy Patriot missiles and anything more sophisticated 
[paetriotu misailbbunanira kuharaebirul] in a short time. 
  We do not like empty talk. 
  Our people and People's Army will severely punish the 
traitors who attempt to harm and stifle [mohae apsal] their 
fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces and will 
resolutely defend our socialist fatherland and the security of 
the nation. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring must know that its futile traitorous 
attempt to enter into confrontation with its fellow countrymen 
will bring its own destruction. The United States had better 
know that there is nothing to gain and nothing good for it even 
if it instigates and gives a shot in the arm [jumurugo ipkimul 
purononun] to such a fool as Kim Yong-sam, who is writhing 
because he was forsaken by the nation and became a target for 
overthrow.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Pro-Japanese Flunkeyist Treachery of </F>
Traitor Kim Yong-sam"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- One of the heaviest 
crimes committed by the traitor Kim Yong-sam in a little more 
than one year since he took office is that he placed outside 
forces above the nation and harmed and sold away the interests 
of the nation for the benefit of outside forces, says NODONG 
SINMUN in a by-lined article today. 
  Citing concrete facts proving that Kim Yong-sam the traitor 
fully laid bare his true color as a pro-Japanese traitor in the 
relations with Japan, the article says: 
  Last year, he often met Japanese reactionaries and made a 
clean sheet of the Japanese imperialists' history of aggression 
on Korea and crossed off the thrice-cursed crimes committed by 
them against the Korean people in the past including the 
drafting of "comfort women for the army" and flung the door open 
for their reinvasion, saying that the relations between South 
Korea and Japan must developed into "new ones". 
  Worse still, he entreated the Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa to suspend the DPRK-Japan talks for 
normalising diplomatic relations till the "nuclear and missile 
issues" of the North were completely settled and to take a joint 
action with South Korea and cried that "the axis of South Korean 
diplomacy is predominant relations with Japan and the United 
States." 
  Kim Yong-sam is throwing himself deeper into the military 
and 
economic spheres of Japan in an attempt to keep his power with 
the backing of Japan. He further broadened economic opening to 
the Japanese reactionaries than his predecessors and is moving 
toward legalising the infiltration of the reactionary culture of 
Japan. 
  It is only too natural that the traitor Kim Yong-sam who 
pays 
no heed to the dignity and interests of the nation and commits 
treacheries to gratify his greed for power has become a target 
of overthrow by the people. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam will face a stern judgement by 
history for his treacherous crimes.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Chong-pil, "chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP]" of 
South Korea, told "an enlarged caucus meeting" on March 21 that 
though many people contend that dialogue should be held with the 
North because it is the same nation, "the government must show a 
cold and strong reaction" to it. 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says his remarks 
were 
an anti-compatriot declaration for cutting off even the bonds 
between the North and the South as the same nation, and a 
declaration of confrontation and war. 
  The analyst says: 
  Rejecting fellow countrymen and pursuing confrontation and 
war is inconceivable for a Korean. 
  The traitor Kim Chong-pil is a pro-Japanese, pro-American 
stooge and an anti-communist fascist who served the defunct 
dictator Pak Chong-hui as his right-hand man and prolonged his 
dirty life by depending on outside forces, estranged from the 
fellow countrymen. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst says such a traitor as Kim Chong-pil, 
who is fostering antagonism and confrontation within the nation 
and bringing the situation to an all the more grave phase must 
be removed with the traitor Kim Yong-sam.

<F P=106> ["White Paper of C.C., GFTUK on Wages Conditions of South </F>
Korean Workers" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee 
[C.C.] of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea 
[GFTUK] on March 22 published a white paper on the wage 
conditions of the South Korean workers. 
  Noting that the South Korean workers now are subsisting on 
unprecedented-in-scale starvation wages due to the Kim Yong-sam 
group's anti-popular labor policy and wage-curbing steps, the 
white paper cites concrete facts proving this. 
  According to the white paper, the wages conditions of South 
Korean workers can be seen graphically in the size of their 
nominal wages per hour which are a meagre one-eighth or 
one-ninth of those in Western countries and far below those of 
the workers in Asian capitalist countries. 
  The wages gap between workers in South Korea is very wide, 
depending on their schooling and sex. 
  A South Korean university professor said the difference 
between uneducated workers and university graduates in terms of 
income was in a ratio of 1 to 37 in case of men and 1 to 54 in 
case of women. 
  Wages of South Korean female workers account for only 42.6 
percent of male workers. 
  The proportion of women among the young workers aged between 
13 and 29 in South Korea is 58 percent. Mainly engaging 
themselves in the fibre, shoemaking, toymaking and electronic 
industries, women are forced to slave labor of 12 to 16 hours a 
day on low monthly wages of 300,000 or 400,000 won. 
  Worse still, South Korean workers have to do extra-hour work 
for three or five days a week, yet not a few workers are paid 
less than the "minimum wages" fixed by the puppets in the "Labor 
Law". 
  Their wages are far below the minimum living cost and, to 
make matters worse, they have to pay most of the meagre wages in 
taxes, instead of using them to keep the pot boiling. 
  At present, more than 200 kinds of taxes are levied upon the 
workers in South Korea. Even according to data released by the 
puppet authorities, the rate of tax burdens in South Korea rose 
to 20.2 percent in 1994 from 16.5 percent of 1986, and the 
amount of tax burdens per head of the population increased to 
1,316,000 won in 1994 from 1,125,000 won of 1993. In case of a 
family of five they have to pay 6.58 million won per annum in 
taxes. 
  The workers' wages in South Korea are too insignificant 
compared with the annually rising commodity prices. A South 
Korean newspaper reported that the rate of the jump of consumer 
prices in the 1983-93 period was not 68.7 percent published by 
the authorities but five times higher than that. 
  House purchasing prices in South Korea are five to six times 
those in the United States and Japan which are believed highest 
in the world. 
  If a wage-earner with a monthly pay of 400,000 won is to buy 
a flat of 20 phyong (one phyong equals six feet square), he has 
to save his wages for more than 50 years, neither eating nor 
spending. 
  South Korean primary school children must pay more than 
820,000 won, middle school pupils 970,000 won and high school 
students 1,230,000 won annually. Besides, there are 
miscellaneous fees of various names they have to pay monthly, 
which run into hundreds of thousands of won. Most of the 
workers who want their children to go to high school or 
university have to make them do their own cooking. In this 
case, monthly charges for a boarding room alone amount to 
310,000 to 370,000 won. 
  The South Korean workers today are suffering from chronic 
occupational diseases and all kinds of illness as they are 
forced into high-intensity labor for long hours under coarse 
work conditions. 
  In South Korea a medical examination costs 5,000 won, and a 
medical checkup for antigen, electrocardiogram and the stomach 
consumes respectively 8,000, 8,500 and 13,000 won. Charges for 
an operation on the stomach are 300,000 won, an operation on 
appendicitis 100,000 won, and a cornea transplanting operation 
180,000 won. When hopitalized, a patient must pay more than 
10,000 won a day, excepting the cost of medicines. 
  When all this is taken into consideration, the South Korean 
workers' wages account for less than one fourth of the actual 
cost of living. 
  This notwithstanding, the comprador businesses under the 
patronage of the ruling quarters frequently go without paying 
the small amount of wages of the workers for several months. 
According to doctored figures published by the competent 
authorities of South Korea, the unpaid wages of workers in South 
Korea in recent years added up to 298.1 billion won. 
  The practice of "keeping wages in arrears" is getting all 
the 
more serious since the traitor Kim Yong-sam came to power. 
According to data, 241 businesses in South Korea were keeping in 
arrears wages to the tune of 58.1 billion won early this year. 
This is five times the figure in the corresponding period of 
1992. (South Korean newspaper TONGA ILBO, Feb. 4, 1994). The 
South Korean newspaper HANGYORE SHINMUN predicted that the 
"wages in arrears" would grow further due to the new regime's 
"tough wage-curbing policy". 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is trying to enforce wage-curbing 
measures like the "no work, no pay" system and the "total wages" 
system, distorting the reality by arguing that the economic 
crisis of South Korea resulted from the workers' struggle for a 
higher pay. It is trying to justify its low wages policy with 
the rhetoric of "economic rejuvination." 
  When labor-management disputes over the wages problem broke 
out, the traitor Kim Yong-sam revealed his true class color, 
contrary to his calls for "hardship sharing" and "common 
destiny", by siding with the management and brandishing the 
sword at the workers. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique vowed to make this year the 
"first year" free of "labor-management disputes", openly 
betraying its scheme to crack down brutally on the workers' 
struggle for the right to live. This is an outspoken 
declaration of war of the "civilian" fascist dictator against 
the labor movement. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam has squandered money earned with 
the 
sweat and blood of workers in arms buildup. According to the 
content of the 1994 "budgetary expenditures" finalized and 
published by the South Korean "economic planning agency", 
military spendings go far beyond 10,000 billion won, or up 9.6 
percent from last year in scale. By contrast, the fund 
earmarked for the "welfare of the working people" accounts for 
less than one 300th of the military expenditures. 
  All this shows that the traitor Kim Yong-sam is a fascist 
dictator, kingpin of plunder and war fanatic stepping up war 
preparations by bleeding the laboring masses white with the 
strong arm. 
  If the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique continues to suppress this 
year the workers' struggle for their elementary right to live, 
including their demand for a higher pay, at the point of the 
bayonet, laying the blame for the economic bankruptcy of South 
Korea at the door of the workers, it would result in 
precipitating its own destruction.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- The Central People's 
Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea recently 
awarded the title of Hero of the Republic to Kim Chol-chin (23), 
a non-commissioned officer of the Korean People's Security 
Forces (KPSF), and the "Kim Il-song Youth Honor Prize" to Kim 
Kyong-chol (20), a KPSF soldier, who have come back home in 
triumph by fighting it out with a rock-firm faith and principles 
as People's Army soldiers, not yielding to the enemy when they 
were taken [word indistinct] South Korea under unavoidable 
circumstances. 
  At the end of January, they were arrested by the South 
Korean 
authorities in distress in the West Sea while on military duty. 
  The enemy employed all conceivable moves to convert the two 
soldiers. 
  The enemy put them each in a solitary cell, allured them 
with 
money and goods, sent in turncoats to win them over and 
threatened them, showing them bloody torture rooms. 
  The enemy, however, could not break the revolutionary 
constancy and will of the KPSF soldiers who have had iron faith. 
  Although they were detained by the enemy, they resolutely 
fought the enemy with a dignified attitude as soldiers of 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, the supreme commander, believing him only 
and sent tremor through the enemy, before coming back to the 
bosom of the socialist homeland, the bosom of General Kim 
Chong-il.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang mass 
meeting took place today in welcome of a non-commissioned 
officer Kim Chol-chin and a soldier Kim Kyong-chol of the Korean 
People's Security Forces. 
  They had been taken away by the enemy in late January after 
falling unconscious in a storm on the sea. But they steadfastly 
defended the authority of the great leader President Kim Il-song 
and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and bravely fought as 
soldiers of comrade supreme commander, undaunted by the enemy's 
relentless threat, appeasement and deception, and returned in 
triumph. 
  When they drifted on the sea, General Kim Chong-il, supreme 
commander, took all the measures necessary for saving them. 
Upon hearing about their heroic deeds, he placed great 
political confidence in them, granting them the honor of being 
members of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and the title of 
the Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the 
"Kim Il-song Youth Honor Prize." 
  Addressing the meeting, Chairman of the Central Committee of 
the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea Choe Yong-hae 
said the heroic deeds displayed by them in a showdown with the 
enemy clearly showed that if anyone bravely fought the enemy 
with the revolutionary faith and indomitable will of trusting 
and following only comrade supreme commander, he could surely 
win in any adversity and return to the socialist homeland. 
  He called on all the working people to keep themselves in 
full combat readiness to cope with the new war provocation moves 
of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique, 
and rise up like a mountain and defend the honor of chuche Korea 
by becoming a fortress and shield, rifles and bombs, when 
comrade supreme commander issued an order. 
  Kim Chol-chin said that they could return to the bosom of 
the 
great general after showing the prowess of young soldiers to the 
enemy, because they were encouraged by the deep trust and 
paternal affection of comrade supreme commander and they had the 
rock-firm faith that they would win, guided by the general. 
  Representatives of factory and office workers, youth and 
students vowed to defend the socialist homeland like an 
impregnable fortress and dynamically accelerate socialist 
construction with a rifle in one hand and a hammer or a pen in 
the other, keeping in their mind the rock-firm faith that they 
will surely win in any circumstances as General Kim Chong-il 
leads them. 
  Present at the meeting was Kim Chung-rin, secretary of the 
Central Committee of the WPK.

<F P=106> ["Indiscreet Preach of Aggression" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- Kazuo Aichi, general 
director of the Defence Agency of Japan, at the commencement of 
the "Defence Academy" a few days ago said "international 
contribution" is an important duty of the "self-defence forces" 
(SDF) and that the role of the "SDF" is increasing in the 
"contribution" through the United Nations. He also talked about 
the "responsibility" of the "SDF." 
  This revealed the sinister intention of the Japanese 
reactionaries to drive the "SDF" into overseas aggression, 
declares NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The "international contribution" of the "SDF" claimed by the 
Japanese reactionary ruling quarters is an excuse to justify 
troop dispatch overseas and the use of arms. 
  By "increasing role" of the "SDF" through the United 
Nations, 
aichi meant to step up its military advance and operations 
overseas by abusing the name of the United Nations. 
  The Japanese reactionaries are these days preaching the 
inevitability of the use of weapons and battles of the "SDF" 
units dispatched overseas and calling for malrevision of the 
"law on cooperation in UN peacekeeping operations," which 
confines their activities to non-military spheres, and for the 
"constitutionality" of "military activities under UN command" 
and "exercise of the right to collective self-defence." Under 
the cloak of "exercise of the right to collective self-defence" 
they intend to start military aggression in real earnest on 
wider areas, major zones of resources and strategic points of 
the world. 
  Japan today is the world's number two in military spendings. 
  What must not go unnoticed is that the Japanese reactionary 
ruling quarters are actively promoting Japan's nuclear armament. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must discard the anachronistic 
militarist mode of thinking and act with discretion.

  [Editorial Report] Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting 
Network in Korean at 2100 GMT on 23 March carries three 
consecutive reports citing Japanese newspaper items on U.S. and 
Japanese military moves aimed at the DPRK. 
  The first of three reports states that "The United States is 
maneuvering to conduct a war exercise on the East Sea of Korea 
[Sea of Japan]. According to a report, the Japanese newspaper 
TOKYO SHIMBUN dated 23 March reported that the U.S. Government 
is considering an independent war exercise on the East Sea of 
Korea. The paper reported that the United States is employing a 
hardline policy against our country, such as the deployment of 
Patriot missiles in South Korea and setting up specific plans to 
resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise. The paper added 
that the U.S. Government is pushing ahead step by step with 
plans to implement a specific hardline policy." 
  The second item begins: "According to a report, the Japanese 
newspaper YOMIURI SHIMBUN dated 23 March reported that Hajime 
Izumi, assistant professor of Sizuoka University, a Korean 
affairs expert, urged Japan to take measures to support the U.S. 
forces in Japan in case of emergency on the Korean peninsula." 
The report notes Izumi's call for an enactment of necessary 
laws for Japan "to effectively cope with a military conflict on 
the Korean peninsula." The report concludes, "This shows that if 
the United States provokes a new war on the Korean peninsula, 
Japan is scheming to actively cooperate and participate in it." 
  The third item reports: "According to a report, the Japanese 
newspaper TOKYO SHIMBUN dated 23 March disclosed that the 
Japanese Self-Defense Air Force openly conducted a field 
maneuver of Patriot missiles on (Shariki) base in Aomori 
Prefecture on 22 March. The paper said that the missile launch 
pads are aimed at the northern sky. The missile field maneuver 
by the Self-Defense Air Force, which is conducted at a time when 
the United States is intensifying the military threat against 
our Republic, saying that it will deploy Patriot missiles to 
South Korea, shows that Japan is dancing to the tune of U.S. 
military pressure."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 (KNS-KCNA) -- The Japanese people 
are protesting Kim Yong-sam's tour of their country. 
  Genzu Watanabe, secretary of the Japan-South Korea Council 
of 
People's Solidarity, made a report and public figures speeches 
at a meeting held in Tokyo on March 17. 
  They pointed out that the criminal purpose of the tour of 
Japan by the traitor Kim Yong-sam is to strengthen the 
Japanese-South Korean joint step against the DPRK, promote 
political conspiracy regarding the past Japan's aggression on 
Korea and colonial rule and build new relations between Japan 
and South Korea. 
  They called upon the Japanese people to obtain a clear 
understanding of the essence of Kim Yong-sam's tour of Japan, 
strengthen solidarity with the South Korean people struggling 
for independence, democracy and peaceful reunification and wage 
a vigorous struggle in demand of a fundamental switchover of the 
Japan government's policy towards Korea.

Tense" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng told Chinese and foreign reporters on March 22 that it has 
been China's consistent position to stand for negotiations and 
dialogues rather than pressure on the issue of nuclear 
inspection in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, XINHUA 
reported. 
  Answering a question by a reporter on China's stand if the 
issue is submitted to the Security Council of the United 
Nations, the premier said that if the method of pressure is 
used, it will only make things more complicated, and make the 
situation on the Korean peninsula tense, and that will not be 
good for the peace and stability of the region.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- Political parties and 
organizations of Guyana and Brazil denounced the U.S. insincere 
attitude toward the talks between the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea and the United States. 
  Fourteen political parties and organizations of Guyana 
including the People's Democratic Movement, the Amerindian 
Action Movement, the Agricultural and General Workers Union and 
the Guyana-Korea Friendship Association released a statement on 
March 7 saying that no problem could be solved in such a manner 
as putting pressure on one side or setting unreasonable 
preconditions. It stressed that the United States must come out 
to the talks without any precondition and fully discharge its 
responsibility and obligation in the solution to the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  The October 8 Revolutionary Movement of Brazil issued a 
statement on March 11 strongly urging the United States to 
immediately rescind the unreasonable preconditions and 
satisfactorily implement all the steps of simultaneous action 
according to the DPRK-U.S. agreed conclusions. 
  It also demanded that Japan and the South Korean authorities 
stop balking the DPRK-U.S. talks and promptly give up their 
nuclear arms development jeopardizing peace not only on the 
Korean peninsula but in Asia and the rest of the world.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- Figures of Mozambique 
and Zimbabwe praised the advantages of the Korean-style 
socialism. 
  The general secretary of the Mozambican Parliament said on 
March 11: 
  Socialism of Korea is the most advantageous one in the 
world. 
  It is a socialism that enables all the people to be well off 
evenly. 
  In Korea all people become true masters of the country and 
are firmly united behind the party and the leader. 
  The Korean-style socialism under the guidance of the great 
President Kim Il-song and dear Comrade Kim Chong-il is a model 
and centre of world socialism. 
  Joseph Macheka, a member of Parliament of the Republic of 
Zimbabwe, in a statement March 6 said now the Korean people, 
united in one mind around the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, are successfully

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and South Korean President Kim Yong-sam shared concerns 
on Thursday over North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program 
and agreed that cooperation among Japan, South Korea and the 
United States is important in solving the problem, Foreign 
Ministry officials said. 
  Hosokawa and Kim also agreed in a meeting at the Akasaka 
state guesthouse on the importance of building future-oriented 
bilateral relations based on the history of the past, the 
officials said. 
  Talks between the two leaders, held amid mounting tension on 
the Korean peninsula, focused on issues concerning North Korea's 
suspected nuclear arms development, according to the officials. 
  Hosokawa and Kim, who arrived earlier in the day for a 
three-day stay in Japan, agreed that the international community 
should take a firm stance against North Korea while leaving the 
door open for dialogue and handling the situation step by step, 
they said. 
  Kim described the situation as "very serious," citing 
Pyongyang's refusal to allow full inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its recent 
aggressive postures, such as threatening to destroy Seoul "in 
flames," they said. 
  Although South Korea will always hold the door open to 
dialogue with the North, there are limits to its patience if 
Pyongyang remains obstinate and tries to procrastinate, the 
officials quoted Kim as saying. 
  Kim told Hosokawa that South Korea has a good security 
system, taking into account the possibility of various 
"accidental" situations occurring, and that it will do its 
utmost to maintain stability on the Korean peninsula, the 
officials said. 
  He explained the decision to deploy Patriot missiles 
following talks with the U.S., and also said Seoul and 
Washington plan to resume the joint Team Spirit military 
exercise unless North Korea changes its attitude, they said. 
  The president said he will decide on the specifics of the 
Team Spirit exercise after he returns home from Beijing, where 
he will fly on Saturday. He did not specify when the Patriot 
missiles would be deployed, the officials said. 
  Hosokawa said Japan will take a "responsible" measure within 
the spirit of the Constitution if the problem of North Korea's 
suspected nuclear weapons is brought to the United Nations 
Security Council, according to the officials. 
  Hosokawa, who returned on Monday from a three-day visit to 
China, briefed Kim about his trip and said he conveyed Japan's 
strict view of the situation and the importance of China's role 
in solving the problem, they said. 
  In connection with the nuclear problem, Hosokawa touched on 
some allegations that Japan intends to build its own nuclear 
weapons, saying it would be impossible for Japan to do so 
because of its three-point nonnuclear policy and because it is 
the only nation to have suffered atomic bombing, the officials 
said. 
  He also said Japan supports the peaceful unification of the 
Korean peninsula in the future. 
  In their meeting, which lasted over 90 minutes, Hosokawa and 
Kim, who met last November in Kyongju, South Korea, also agreed 
on the importance of building a future-oriented relationship by 
looking correctly at history, the officials said. 
  The reference was to the 1910-45 Japanese colonization of 
the 
Korean peninsula. 
  Kim was quoted as saying such future-oriented bilateral 
relations would have great meaning for Asia nations as well as 
the rest of the world. 
  Hosokawa and Kim also agreed that Japan, South Korea and 
Russia should make efforts to effect as soon as possible 
measures to solve such problems as the return of Koreans left 
behind on the Russian Far East island of Sakhalin to their 
homeland, the officials said. 
  Japan forcibly took tens of thousands of Koreans as laborers 
to Sakhalin, whose southern half it ruled from 1905 until the 
end of World War II, but left them behind when the island came 
under Soviet rule. 
  About 43,000 ethnic Koreans are currently living on 
Sakhalin, 
according to Sakhalin government statistics. Hosokawa said his 
heart aches to think of the hardships the people left on 
Sakhalin suffered. 
  Also during their talks, Hosokawa and Kim exchanged views 
about their respective political and economic reform efforts, 
the officials said. 
  Kim and Hosokawa are scheduled to hold a second round of 
talks on Saturday to discuss mainly economic matters. They also 
agreed to discuss the North Korean problem again if necessary, 
the officials said. 
  Later Thursday evening, Kim attended a dinner hosted by 
Emperor Akihito. 
  On Friday, he will deliver speeches in the Diet and at 
Waseda 
University.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and South Korean President Kim Yong-sam agreed in talks 
on Thursday to cooperate with the United States on the issue of 
North Korea's potential nuclear weapons capability, Foreign 
Ministry officials said. 
  Officials said Hosokawa and Kim, who arrived in Japan 
earlier 
in the day for a three-day official visit, expressed concern 
over the issue in which North Korea has refused to allow 
unimpeded inspections of its controversial nuclear facilities by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The two leaders also agreed that Japan and South Korea 
should 
construct a future-oriented bilateral relationship, while 
keeping in mind the dark episodes in their past history. The 
reference was to the Japanese colonization of the Korean 
peninsula from 1910-45. 
  Hosokawa and Kim discussed their respective experiences in 
implementing political reforms in their countries, the officials 
said. 
  Kim reportedly said if North Korea tries to buy time on the 
nuclear issue, there will be a limit to South Korean patience 
and it will be unavoidable for the international community to 
take a tough stance. 
  South Korea has prepared thorough security measures and will 
start this year's joint military exercises with the United 
States, code-named "Team Spirit," if Pyongyang does not change 
its stance, Kim said. He said he will make a concrete decision 
after his visit to China, which he leaves for from Japan on 
Saturday. 
  Hosokawa said it is imperative to leave open an avenue for 
dialogue with North Korea and to respond step by step.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam on Thursday [24 March] officially invited Emperor 
Akihito and Empress Michiko to visit South Korea to forge a new 
future-oriented relationship, the Imperial Household Agency 
said. "I would like to promote relations between South Korea 
and Japan from a forward-looking, future-oriented view," a 
senior Imperial Palace official quoted Kim as saying. 
  Bilateral relations are still overshadowed by Japan's 
colonial rule of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, and 
anti-Japanese sentiment continues to run high. 
  Kim and his wife, Son Myong-sun, had a 25-minute audience 
with the imperial couple in an "overall pleasant atmosphere," 
Kiyoshi Sumiya, grand master of ceremonies, said. 
  "I think it would benefit our friendly neighborly relations 
if we could welcome the emperor and the empress in South Korea. 
I would like to seize this good opportunity to offer an 
invitation," Kim told the imperial couple. 
  The emperor replied it is the Japanese Government's decision 
on whether he goes abroad. 
  In an interview ahead of the visit, Kim, who was elected 
last 
year to a single five-year term, said he believes he will be 
able to receive the emperor in Seoul during his term in office. 
  The emperor told Kim it is important that both nations 
deepen 
their exchange while reflecting on history and respecting each 
other's cultures. 
  During colonization, Koreans were forbidden from speaking 
Korean in public and had to adopt Japanese names. In addition, 
Japan's forced recruitment of tens of thousands of Korean women 
for wartime military brothels has refueled bitter memories.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- The following is the full 
text of Emperor Akihito's speech at the state banquet in honor 
of South Korean President Kim Yong-sam on Thursday [24 March]. 
  I wish to offer my hearty welcome to your excellency the 
president of the Republic of Korea, now paying a visit to this 
country as a state guest with Mrs. Kim Yong-sam. It gives me 
utmost pleasure to be able to have the company of your 
excellency, Mrs. Kim Yong-sam and the members of their suite at 
this banquet. 
  Your country is the nearest neighbor to us. Exchanges 
between our people date back to ancient times preceding the 
descriptions in history books. A variety of arts and sciences 
were introduced to Japan by your people and our ancestors 
learned many things from your people. 
  In the course of long and close exchanges between our two 
countries, there was a period during which my country inflicted 
great many sufferings on the people of the Korean peninsula. As 
I expressed my deep sorrow over this some years ago, I always 
have the same feeling. Since the end of the war, our people, on 
the basis of the lesson of the past history, have endeavored to 
build up unshaken trust and friendship with your people. 
  I am gratified that friendship and cooperative relations 
between our two countries have recently been advanced in many 
different fields thanks to the continuous enthusiasm and efforts 
of their people and that the ties binding the nations have been 
strengthened, as seen in the "Korean cultural envoy" events 
including the Kaya cultural exhibition two years ago, and the 
international exhibition held in Taejon city last year. I 
earnestly hope that their mutual understanding will deepen on 
all possible occasions. 
  Today, the world is encountering waves of dramatic changes. 
In this situation, our two countries, as your excellency the 
president has repeatedly stated, should further solidify their 
friendly and cooperative ties and blaze hand-in-hand the path to 
the future. Your excellency has been promoting "the creation of 
a new Republic of Korea" and making serious efforts to 
strengthen the relationship between Japan and the Republic of 
Korea. I am confident that your excellency's present visit to 
this country will prove to be an extremely significant occasion 
for the future relations of our two countries. 
  Although your excellency's stay is short, it is my ardent 
hope that you will enjoy the spring of our country, meet a broad 
range of people in various circles, personally observe our 
country's actual condition, and find your visit fruitful. 
  With best wishes for the further development of friendship 
between our two countries, may I now propose a toast to the good 
health and happiness of your excellency the President and Mrs. 
Kim Yong-sam, and the prosperity of the people of the Republic 
of Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- The following is the full 
text of South Korean President Kim Yong-sam at the state banquet 
hosted by Emperor Akihito on Thursday [24 March]. 
  Your majesties, your royal highnesses, your excellencies 
Prime Minister and Mrs. Hosokawa, distinguished guests, 
  I am grateful for the warm hospitality that has been 
extended 
to my wife, myself and my delegation and also for this splendid 
dinner. 
  Your majesty has just made some very kind and friendly 
comments about the Korean people. I am certain that your 
remarks will serve as an invaluable catalyst for developing our 
bilateral relationship. 
  I am visiting your country in the belief that our two 
countries must endeavor to build truly neighborly ties of 
cooperation looking ahead into the future. 
  As close neighbors, our two countries have interacted with 
each other in the cultural and other fields for many centuries. 
We must continue to be such close and good neighbors for 
millennia to come. 
  At the turn of the century, it is true, Korean-Japanese 
relations were put to a severe test by the thunderstorms and 
turbulent currents of history. But we must not let our past 
fetter our progress into the future any longer. My conviction 
is that a new era of strong neighborly ties will surely arrive 
once we squarely face the past just as it was and have earnestly 
learned its lessons. Only if our two peoples continue to expand 
exchanges in all fields will a new good-neighborly relationship 
surely begin to develop. Our two countries should benefit from 
the shared advantages of a long history of interaction as well 
as geographical proximity. 
  Your majesty, 
  The fast-approaching century will almost certainly be an 
Asia-Pacific century. I believe that both our nations face a 
mandate of history to work together as partners to usher in this 
new era. This mandate must be fulfilled without fail. The firm 
resolve of both our peoples bolstered by their shared past 
experiences will greatly help power the march of mankind toward 
a new Asia, a new Pacific and a new world. 
  Your majesty, 
  Our two countries are jointly pursuing the universal ideals 
of freedom, democracy and market economics. Both our countries 
are striving for sweeping reforms and greater openness. With a 
shared sense of mission, both the Republic of Korea and Japan 
are now more determined and enthusiastic than ever about 
building a diverse bilateral relationship on the strength of a 
broad pubic consensus in both lands. 
  We must establish a rock-solid bilateral relationship before 
the present century is out. By building an ROK-Japan 
partnership in answer to the call of the times, we should 
together lead the long march into the 21st century of peace and 
prosperity. 
  Let us pool our wisdom and strength so that we will be able 
to proudly pass on to posterity the heirloom of a good 
neighborly relationship marked by a spirit of mutual help and 
interdependence. 
  Distinguished guests, 
  Please join me in toasting the good health and longevity of 
their majesties, the boundless prosperity of the Japanese people 
and the evolution of neighborly ties of cooperation between the 
Republic of Korea and Japan. 
  Thank you.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- Japan and South Korea 
agreed Thursday [24 March] to work together to formulate an 
industrial program to foster South Korea's parts industries. 
The accord was reached during a meeting between Japanese 
International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai and 
his South Korean counterpart Kim Chol-su, who is accompanying 
President Kim Yong-sam on his three-day visit to Japan from 
Thursday. 
  The joint program will feature acceptance by Japanese 
companies of South Korean trainees and dispatch of technological 
experts from Japan to South Korea. This is regarded as an 
effort to nurture small-sized South Korean companies, 
particularly "supporting" industries such as components makers, 
an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) told a news conference. 
  Under the accord, to be endorsed at Saturday's meeting 
between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Kim, Seoul will 
provide business incentives to South Korean parts makers through 
tax reforms and financial systems, the MITI briefer said. He 
said the program will be formulated so that it can be officially 
announced on May 26 when Kumagai and his South Korean 
counterpart meet again. 
  During Thursday's meeting between Kumagai and Kim, Tokyo and 
Seoul also agreed to cooperate on standards and certificates of 
industrial products and in insurance fields, the MITI official 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- South Korea's construction 
minister urged Japan Thursday [24 March] to allow South Korean 
contractors to participate in open biddings Japan plans to 
introduce from April for large-scale public works projects, 
government officials said. Kim U-sok, who is accompanying 
President Kim Yong-sam on a three-day visit to Tokyo from 
Thursday, made the request in a meeting with Kozo Igarashi, 
Japan's construction minister. 
  Igarashi said that Seoul has to join in a government 
procurements agreement under the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT) and open its market before being allowed to 
make bids for Japanese public works. "If South Korea joins the 
GATT treaty and liberalizes its market, it will be treated like 
others," Igarashi said. 
  At the GATT-sponsored Uruguay Round of multilateral trade 
talks, completed in December last year, South Korea expressed 
its willingness to sign the government procurements pact, to 
come into force in January 1996. To do so, however, requires 
the country to liberalize its market first. The country has so 
far banned foreign contractors from making bids for its projects 
on their own.
