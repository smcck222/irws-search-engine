  [Text] In his report to the nation yesterday, President 
Ramos talked about five priorities which the government will 
focus on in order to accelerate national economic progress. 
  Foremost among the five priorities is the stability of free 
industries and the protection of Filipino workers abroad. Also 
included in the priorites is the implementation of strict 
discipline in governmental financial management through 
effective rules and regulations, and efficient coordination in 
the execution of economic programs. Likewise, the government 
must attend to the on-going peace talks with the rebels in order 
to end the armed rebellion. 
  The President also promises to make alterations in programs 
in order to administer justice, decrease criminality, and 
increase trust in the government, programs targeted primarily at 
the uniformed scalawags and anomalous government officials. 
  In this connection, the House of Representatives will extend 
all the support needed by the Ramos administration in order for 
it to be successful in 1994, and to proceed with national 
improvement plans through the year 2000. 
  This was the statement made by Speaker Jose de Venecia, Jr., 
in response to the report to the nation presented by President 
Ramos yesterday at Malacanang regarding the Ramos 
Administration's accomplishments in 1993, and its plans for this 
year and the years to come. 
  According to De Venecia, almost all of the legislative 
proposals and the support asked for or set forth by President 
Ramos have been approved by the House, such as the Foreign Bank 
Liberalization Act, Build, Operate and Transfer Act, and other 
bills relating to business progress, tax collection, and 
attracting foreign investors. 
  De Venecia also stated that it is up to the Senate to act 
now 
because the bills approved by the lower House have been pending 
in the upper House.

  [Text] The Senate strongly affirmed that there will be no 
new taxes this year, 1994, except that it hopes to widen the 
scope of the value added tax (VAT). 
  Senator Ernesto Herrera, chairman of the Senate Ways and 
Means Committee, said that this year, the committee will not 
discuss the five tax measures endorsed by Malacanang and the 20 
percent excise tax on non-essential commodities, the stocks 
transaction tax, the re-imposition of dividends tax, and the tax 
increase on beer and soft drinks. The five bills are expected 
to yield an annual net increase of 4.4 billion pesos in tax 
revenues to the government. 
  Herrera stated that many senators disagree with the idea of 
creating new taxes because they believe that what must be done 
is for the government to revamp its system of collecting taxes, 
and change them so as to improve tax collection methods. 
  Herrera pointed to the inefficient performance of the Bureau 
of Internal Revenue, and of the Bureau of Customs, in 1993, 
despite the passage of legislation designed to improve tax 
collection efficiency. In the study of the work done by the 
Philippine Institute For Development Studies, it was revealed 
that the government had failed to bring in 29.1 million pesos, 
or 14 per cent of the national tax revenues due in 1992. At 
present, the Senate is still studying the bill designed to widen 
the scope of the VAT. 
  In the bill are recommendations relating to the additional 
collection of 2 billion pesos in government revenues annually, 
by means of the passage of the VAT bill, including taxes on 
hotels, restaurants, and highly paid professionals, like 
athletes and movie stars.

  [Text] Malacanang announced the signing by President Ramos 
of the 330.2 billion peso 1994 National Government Budget, which 
is 31.8 billion less than the 362 billion peso allocation bill 
submitted by Malacanang. However, the Chief Executive pointed 
out that itme number seven in the Republic Act No. 4663, more 
popularly known as the 1994 General Appropirations Acts, 
includes the 31.5 billion peso cut in debt servicing on national 
debt payments. 
  Yesterday, the President also rejected: 
  -- provisions designating departmental savings as the new 
funding source for the payment of fringe benefits or pensions; 
  --the outlay or disbursement of budget increases in some 
government offices as a result of the budgetary realignments of 
Congress; 
  --budgetary augmentation through using income, and the 
creation, operation, and maintenance of revolving funds; and 
  --tightening in the outlay or expenditure of some 
appropriations. 
  In a single ceremony at Malacanang, the President stated 
that 
"The speedy consolidation and passing of the 1994 GAA shows the 
common wish of the executive and legistative branches to create 
a national fund that will help in the development goals of the 
nation."

  [Text] The announcement a few days ago by a World Bank 
representative to the Philippines that "the Philippine 
Government has progressed tremendously in its reforms of the 
financial system" is good for the financial stability of the 
government this year. 
  The second and last portion of the Financial Sector 
Adjustment Loan of $520 million, as managed by the World Bank, 
can help in the cash operations of the Philippine Government. 
It is also beautiful proof of frugal financial management by 
the Philippine Government. In addition, it paves the way for 
the restructuring of the Philippine debt of more than $3 billion. 
  One of the conditions set forth by the World Bank is the 
reorganization of the old Central Bank. Various financial means 
of freeing the new Central Bank of the Philippines from the 
problems of the past have been realized. Now it can begin its 
operations, which will have positive net worth or equity. This 
has resulted in the release of the remainder of the loan. 
  The added cash will no doubt facilitate the daily operations 
of the government. More importantly, it is a testimony to the 
belief in reforming the system and to the credibility of the 
Philippine government. It also strengthens the stability of the 
security notes issued by financial institutions in the 
Philippines, and furthermore, it attests to lighter foreign 
debts, and to the procurement and securing of capital. 
  We should be happy about these new indicators of recovery, 
and the anticipation of the positive effects of the additional 
funds on possible job creation this year.

  [Text] Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong says the policy of 
isolating Myanmar [Burma] has not worked. He said the 
international community should instead engage in constructive 
dialogues with Yangon [Rangoon] if it wants to seek change in 
the country. Speaking at the end of his three-day official 
visit to Myanmar, Mr. Goh said that after many years of 
self-isolation, the country now wants to open up its economy. 
He said ASEAN's policy of constructive engagement is the right 
one. The prime minister also encouraged businessmen and leaders 
from Western countries to visit Myanmar to assess the situation. 
More importantly, such visits will give them the opportunity to 
put forward their viewpoints to the country's leadership. 
  Myanmar's minister for national planning and economic 
development, Brigadier General David Abel, said Mr. Goh's visit 
has built a lot of confidence in the business community. He 
added he now expects better rapport between businessmen in the 
two countries.

  [Text] Mr. Goh Chok Tong, prime minister of the Republic 
of Singapore, who is currently on a goodwill visit to Myanmar 
[Burma], held a news conference with local and foreign 
journalists at 1115 today at Seinle Kantha Guest House. The 
news conference was attended by responsible officials; local and 
foreign journalists; journalists from REUTER TV, NHK TV, KYODO, 
and NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN; and freelance journalist Dominique 
Faulder. 
  Singapore Prime Minister Mr. Goh Chok Tong said his trip to 
Myanmar is part of current efforts to assess economic 
opportunities for Singapore companies. He explained that 
Singapore is encouraging entrepreneurs and investors to invest 
in neighboring countries and that he had also visited the 
People's Republic of China, Vietnam, India, Thailand, and 
Indonesia in order to assess for himself the economic 
opportunities in those countries. He said he was also able to 
familiarize himself with political developments in those 
countries and that he came to Burma with similar objectives. 
  Mr. Goh explained that the objective is to cooperate with 
the 
Government of the Union of Myanmar for investment in Myanmar and 
to study how to persuade Singapore investors. He said economics 
and politics are inseparable, and investors would like to know 
about developments in Myanmar before building hotels, offices, 
and factories. This is why he came -- to enable investors to 
discover for themselves, and for himself to assess developments 
in Myanmar. 
  The Singapore prime minister said he did not discuss the 
issue of Myanmar's entry into ASEAN during his visit and he 
believes it is still premature to discuss the issue. He said 
Thailand, as host of the ASEAN meeting in July, can invite 
Myanmar if it wishes and there is an identity of views on this 
matter among the ASEAN nations. 
  He said Myanmar has some delicate problems regarding 
economic 
and political affairs. He said that economically Myanmar 
authorities want to practice a market economy and attract more 
tourists and foreign investment. He said the Government of 
Myanmar fully understands the need for foreign investment and is 
aware of the impact of economic development on politics. He 
said that politically the Myanmar Government is striving to 
obtain unity with ethnic organizations. He cited the holding of 
the National Convention as a government undertaking. He said he 
discussed this matter at considerable length. In his view, the 
Myanmar Government has considerable problems in this regard. He 
said he learned that efforts are being made to improve the 
situation, and he expressed the hope that efforts appropriate to 
the time will be undertaken. 
  Mr. Goh explained that he did not discuss human rights, but 
he discussed Myanmar's political situation extensively with 
Senior General Than Shwe and Secretary-1 Lieutenant General Khin 
Nyunt. He said the discussions included matters relating to Daw 
Aung San Suu Kyi. However, as the discussions were private, he 
could not elaborate. 
  He said Singapore follows the International Declaration on 
Human Rights and violations of human rights have an effect on 
the foreign policy of a country. However, he recognizes that 
human rights situations vary from country to country. He said 
he believes trade will benefit the people of Myanmar as 
international trade involves contact with people of other 
countries and will enable them to understand the procedures 
involved in international business. 
  Continuing, Mr. Goh said that trade and investment are on 
the 
rise in Myanmar and this in turn will greatly benefit Myanmar 
society. He said he believes trade will benefit Myanmar society 
in the long term, but he did not discuss the matter of using 
Singapore as a model for developing Myanmar. The Myanmar 
Government is increasingly welcoming investment from Singapore. 
Singapore is interested in some sectors in Myanmar and he 
believes that the two countries will be able to cooperate for 
mutual benefit. 
  He said the outstanding success of Singapore can be 
attributed to factors on all fronts. He said it is necessary to 
create a correct situation and that in order to create such a 
situation, an effective government is necessary, and such a 
government should be capable of organizing the people to obtain 
a common view. Furthermore, he said Singapore is located in a 
region which is experiencing accelerated development. He said 
Singapore is competitive internationally because it is able to 
organize the strength of the people, although it does not have 
any natural resources. He said, therefore, that it is necessary 
to combine organizational skills, national leadership, and the 
people's strength in order to create positive situations. 
  Mr. Goh recalled that he visited Myanmar for the first time 
in 1980 and again in 1986. This is his third trip and he noted 
many changes in the country. He said Yangon [Rangoon] is now 
cleaner and the roads are wider with new buildings and renovated 
old buildings. He said these are signs of genuine economic 
improvement in the city of Yangon. He added that Myanmar 
desires foreign investment and has become more open. He said he 
believes prospects for progress in Myanmar are good, but he does 
not want to compare Myanmar to other countries. He said the 
ratio of the population to natural resources in Myanmar is very 
favorable and Myanmar can be described as having the best 
prospects in the region next to Malaysia. 
  He said Myanmar has many mineral, forest, marine, and 
natural 
resources and fallow and virgin lands. He said he views Myanmar 
as a country very rich in natural resources and the exploitation 
of these natural resources is still very low. This is why he 
thinks Myanmar has very good potential. However, he said, it is 
necessary to create positive conditions for foreign investors. 
  He said Myanmar has remained in self-isolation for many 
years 
and the present pressing economic problem is to link its economy 
to that of the free international market. He said the process 
will take time. He said there has been no foreign investment 
because foreign investors are still assessing the situation in 
Myanmar. 
  Mr. Goh said the Myanmar side has given a practical response 
to foreign investors' concerns about the foreign exchange rate. 
He said the Myanmar Government said that entrepreneurs already 
know how to deal with the issue. He said the Myanmar side 
recognizes the high value of the kyat and the fact that the 
Foreign Exchange Certificate rate is based on the free market 
rate, although it cannot be described as a blackmarket rate. He 
said there is an official rate as well a free market rate. He 
said the entrepreneurs know how to operate with these rates. 
  Mr. Goh said that although Myanmar has not officially joined 
regional circles, it needs to show more openness if it wishes to 
participate in regional affairs. He said he has encouraged and 
urged the Myanmar leaders on this matter. He said economics and 
politics are related and that there can be no economic relations 
with Myanmar without good political relations. He said the 
Singapore delegation came to Myanmar as a friend and it is 
necessary to have mutual benefits in a market economy. He said 
there should not be a one-sided situation wherein Singapore 
enjoys 80 percent of the profits while Myanmar only enjoys 20 
percent. 
  On the political front he urged Myanmar to return to the 
international community as he mentioned in his speech. He said 
at present Myanmar is isolated internationally and he believes 
Myanmar should make efforts to return to the international 
community. 
  He said Singapore wishes to assist Myanmar in developing the 
tourist industry. In the next five years the number of tourists 
visiting Myanmar will increase from the current 100,000 to 
200,000 or 300,000. He said that as the tourist industry 
develops, there will be more hotels, shops, and economic 
enterprises. He said Myanmar is a very rich agricultural 
country and he hopes it can meet domestic demand as well as 
enter the international market. He said agriculture could 
constitute a major export sector and expressed his hope that 
Myanmar's economic undertakings will be successful. 
  Continuing, the Singapore prime minister said he believes 
the 
constructive engagement policy of ASEAN is correct. Myanmar 
remained in self-isolation for many years, but it is now opening 
itself economically to the world. He said the international 
community can help Myanmar by holding constructive discussions. 
He said because Myanmar has remained isolated for a long 
period, the policy of isolation will not be successful. He said 
efforts to make Myanmar more isolated will be in vain. He said 
because of these factors, he decided to visit and hold talks 
with the Myanmar leaders. 
  He said discussions on some matters were delicate and he 
could not disclose details. He said Singapore was able to 
present its views to the Myanmar side and encouraged Myanmar to 
undertake certain measures. He said the main purpose of his 
visit to Myanmar this time is to find markets for investment by 
Singapore entrepreneurs. He said Singapore is well aware of the 
economic potential of Myanmar, but at the same time Singapore is 
aware of the delicate political situation. 
  He said he came to Myanmar because he believes that his 
constructive discussions with the Myanmar leaders will help 
normalize the situation and that the time is ripe for a visit to 
Myanmar. He said he did not know whether the actions taken by 
Western countries match their words. However, countries pay 
great attention to economic relations. He said he urged Western 
leaders and entrepreneurs to visit Myanmar themselves because 
only then can they assess the situation in the country for 
themselves. Furthermore, what is more important is that they 
will be able to present their views to the Myanmar leaders. As 
more leaders and entrepreneurs visit, they will have more 
opportunities to present their views to the Myanmar leadership 
and Myanmar will benefit further. 
  He said he discussed the political situation in Myanmar for 
a 
considerable time with Sr. Gen. Than Shwe and Lt. Gen. Khin 
Nyunt. However, he said, his discussions were an expression of 
his views on what should be done in the future and they do not 
amount to giving advice. He said the discussions were private. 
  He said there was no pressure from the U.S. for improving 
relations between Myanmar and Singapore. He said even if the 
U.S. applies pressure it will not bring any results. He said 
Singapore is an independent nation which practices an 
independent foreign policy. 
  The news conference ended at 1140.

  [Text] Dear listeners: The National Coalition Government 
of the Union of Burma [NCGUB] issued a statement today saying it 
has received news that U Myint Maung, a NCGUB minister who has 
been reported missing since 25 March, is in the hands of the 
SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council]. 
  The statement says U Myint Maung, NCGUB minister of 
agriculture and forests, disappeared on 25 March while en route 
from Chiang Mai to Bangkok. When the NCGUB began investigating 
the disappearance, it received news he had fallen into SLORC 
hands. U Myint Maung was elected as a representative from Einme 
Township constituency 2, Irrawaddy Division in the 1990 
elections. 
  Similarly, two NCGUB ministers -- Minister U Win Ko and 
Minister U Hla Pe -- were assassinated while traveling in 1993. 
The NCGUB is highly suspicious of the SLORC's role in the two 
murders and the recent disappearance of Minister U Myint Maung.

  [Text] Knin, 26 Feb (TANJUG) -- The republic of Serb 
Krajina and the Republic of Croatia today signed a document 
extending the cease-fire agreement until 31 March. Apart from 
the extension of the cease-fire, the warring sides agreed to 
continue talks on reaching a general cease-fire. 
  This is the third time the cease-fire agreement between 
Krajina and Croatia -- originally signed on 17 December 1993 -- 
has been extended. The cease-fire has been holding, apart from 
sporadic provocations on the part of the Croatian Army, 
especially in northern Dalmatia and Lika. 
  In the presence of Colonel Wood and UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] Commander Jean Cot the [extension] document was signed 
by Colonel Kosta Novakovic, assistant commander of the Serb 
Krajina army, in agreement with the civilian and military 
authorities of Krajina.

  [Text] Mate Granic, vice president and minister for foreign 
affairs, has addressed the annual session of the UN Human Rights 
Commission in Geneva. Jadranka Kosor spoke to Granic over the 
phone following his address: 
  [Kosor] Croatia has sharply condemned every kind of 
violation 
of human rights, Mate Granic said in his address. 
  [Begin Granic recording] In addition to this, I spoke 
clearly 
in my address about ways envisaged by the Republic of Croatia to 
resolve the current crisis, both with regard to the negotiations 
on Bosnia-Herzegovina and to relations with the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia, i.e. the normalization of these relations, which 
crucially depend on developments in the UN Protected Areas, that 
is the reintegration of these areas into the constitutional and 
legal system of the Republic of Croatia. 
  I also stressed that--regardless of Mr. Mazowiecki's report, 
the U.S. State Department's report, and those of some other 
important nongovernmental organizations in which they reflect on 
some violations of human rights in Croatia--Croatia has, 
nevertheless, welcomed all international institutions. They 
conduct their activities in the former Yugoslavia from their 
bases in Croatia. [end recording] 
  [Kosor] Croatia proposed to the Human Rights Commission a 
special resolution in which the problem of missing persons would 
be treated as separate from other humanitarian problems. 
Representatives of associations of families of missing persons 
and POW's are also in Geneva, Granic said. They were received 
by the president of the Human Rights Commission today. The 
Croatian foreign affairs minister has left Geneva for London.

  [Text] Knin, 25 Feb (TANJUG) -- Due to the full blockade of 
western Slavonia, which is still in progress, protest meetings 
were held in the republic of Serb Krajina today where citizens 
and young people expressed displeasure and indignation over 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] behavior. 
  Several thousand citizens of Knin spontaneously rallied in 
the square in front of the railway station in the Krajina 
capital this morning. The rally was addressed by members of the 
Citizens' Protest committee and representatives of other 
citizens' and youth organizations. 
  "Our freedom is being threatened, world powers wish to 
transform us into a camp," this is only one of the messages that 
were voiced at this rally. 
  The attitude of the citizens of Krajina is best reflected in 
placards carried by young citizens of Knin: "We cannot give up 
western Slavonia," "Protection yes, occupation no," "UNPROFOR, 
go to the Croatian border." 
  Similar messages were voiced at other rallies in Krajina, in 
Vojnic, Benkovac, and other towns where strong support was 
voiced for Milan Martic, the president of the republic of Serb 
Krajina, to defend Krajina's sovereignty in talks with UN 
special envoy Yasushi Akashi today.

  [Text] Croatian Deputy Foreign Minister Ivo Sanader today 
delivered a protest note to Andrej Zlebnik, charge d'affaires at 
the Slovene Embassy in Zagreb, in the absence of Slovene 
Ambassador Malesic. The note refers to frequent incidents 
involving Slovene police in Croatian territorial waters in Piran 
Bay. 
  The note says that such incidents preempt a final solution 
of 
the border problem in Piran Bay, which is being addressed by a 
joint Croatian-Slovene diplomatic border commission. 
  Deputy Minister Sanader says that Croatia is interested in 
maintaining good neighborly relations with Slovenia and solving 
all open issues by mutual agreement.

  [Text] Knin, 26 Feb (TANJUG) -- Bnanko Vojnica, speaker of 
the assembly of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], has sent, 
via the diplomatic and consular offices in Belgrade, a letter to 
representatives of all parliaments in the world calling on them 
to establish working contacts with Krajina's parliament. 
  Since your government does not recognize the RSK government 
and does not want to exchange information and engage in 
arguments with it, I suggest that our two parliaments establish 
working contacts and thus contribute to ending the war and the 
suffering of innocent people and to solving all disputes in the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia by peaceful means, the letter 
says. 
  Vojnica informs the parliaments about the history of the 
Serb 
people in the territory of former Croatia and stresses that the 
Serbs do not want to live in the same state with Croats. 
  The letter also quotes the results of the multiparty 
elections held in the RSK last December, and says that through 
the elections the people of the RSK confirmed their right to 
self-determination.

<F P=106> [Mate Piskor commentary: "Peace Without the 6th Fleet?"] </F>
  [Text] "When will the 6th Fleet arrive?" many wondered at 
the beginning of the aggression on Croatia. What is the United 
States waiting for, why do they allow the destruction of the 
Yalta system, others wondered, marveling at messages totally 
different from what they hoped for, primarily from Baker, 
Zimmermann, Eagleberger, and other officials of the Bush 
administration. A third group thought that the United States 
only needed time to wake up and that it would intervene in favor 
of the just cause sooner or later. 
  Much water has passed under the bridge since then, as it was 
three years ago, but those who claimed the United States needed 
time to realize, or better yet, find its interest in the matter 
seem to have been right. Our country did not get help from the 
6th Fleet, but something else -- with far-reaching consequences 
for Croatia -- has begun to happen, both regarding the 
involvement of the United States in solving the Balkan crisis, 
understanding the real situation, and making moves that could 
produce results. 
  Mr. Charles Redman, President Clinton's special envoy, who 
has visited Zagreb twice in the last week, has made it clear 
that the Clinton administration is very seriously involved in 
trying to find the solution for reaching an agreement on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and has pointed out that "the present 
involvement could lay the foundations for the future of both 
Bosnia and Croatia, a future in which the two countries would be 
closely connected with the mainstream of Europe." 
  What is Redman trying to say? What does the United States 
want from Croatia and what is it offering in return, pointing 
out that Croatia could play a pivotal role in helping (the 
United States) to reach a peaceful solution in Bosnia? First of 
all, they want Croatia to cooperate and attempt to find a 
peaceful solution, and they want the Bosnian Croats to do the 
same, in addition to being prepared to make compromises. 
  The United States is simply insisting on the immediate 
cessation of hostilities between the Croats and the Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and on a new alliance of the two former 
allies, currently bitter enemies; they want a clear situation so 
as to be able to put more pressure on the Serbs. What are they 
trying to accomplish by that? Their primary concern is to give 
a positive reply to the pressure coming from the Islamic 
countries, which want the United States to protect the Bosnian 
Muslims. Moreover, by insisting on connecting the Croatian and 
Muslim parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina and resting that against the 
Republic of Croatia, they want to enable that state creation to 
survive and have firm ties with Europe. Therefore, Redman 
promised Croatia, and also a Bosnia-Herzegovina connected to 
Croatia, integration with the West, the European Union, and the 
United States. 
  The Frankfurt rapprochement of Granic's and Silajdzic's 
negotiating positions is an important indicator of the success 
and efficiency of the new U.S. approach. And so is the 
unilateral cease-fire of the Croatian Defense Council, and the 
clear promise of the West to protect besieged Croatian areas. 
  The world wants to use the favorable climate created by the 
NATO ultimatum and the withdrawal of the Serbs -- and the United 
States has now taken the leading role -- to begin the process of 
normalization on the territory of former Yugoslavia. If the 
Muslims relinquish their maximalist goals, they will be offered 
survival and a state fit for existence; the Bosnian Croats are 
being offered and guaranteed equality in Bosnia-Herzegovina as 
well as safety in the currently besieged enclaves, and Croatia, 
apart from having the silent economic embargo lifted, is offered 
inclusion in European and other international integration 
processes. Furthermore, the United States has made it clear to 
Croatia that, in addition to solving the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, it will take determined action to establish 
full sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia within its 
internationally recognized borders. 
  Post-ultimatum peace initiatives should be taken as 
seriously 
as the Serbs are serious in their response to the ultimatum; 
especially if those initiatives are taken and backed by the 
United States, which is also pointing out that it is acting in 
full concordance with the European Union. This initiative -- 
realistically speaking -- could finally bring peace to 
southeastern Europe, even without the direct involvement of the 
6th Fleet, although one must never forget that it is close at 
hand.

<F P=106> [Z. Skerlev report: "Concern About Greece's Embargo"] </F>
  [Text] Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov yesterday 
received Hans van den Broek, EU commissioner for foreign 
affairs, who stayed in Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] on his arrival from Athens. According to 
the information released by the cabinet of the President, Mr. 
van den Broek transmitted the Greek answer to the written 
message conveyed by President Gligorov to Greek Prime Minister 
Papandreou. The meeting, aimed at searching for solutions to 
problems in Macedonian-Greek relations, and which started two 
days ago, was continued with the participation of Foreign 
Minister Branko Crvenkovski. 
  Before his departure for Brussels, EU Commissioner Van den 
Broek gave a statement to journalists at the Skopje Airport. 
"There is good reason to hope we will find mechanisms for 
restarting the dialogue between Greece and this Republic; 
however, there are still important problems to be solved," he 
said. "I do not underestimate the problem with the measures 
taken by Greece against this Republic, which have burdened the 
possibilities for deblocking the situation. In any case, we 
would once again like to make a serious review of the situation, 
and in Brussels we shall submit a report to the ministers and 
then see what can be done further on. 
  "I am grateful for the cooperation we had here, as well as 
for the willingness to continue our common search for a 
solution." 
  Asked when the embargo of Greece against Macedonia would be 
lifted, van den Broek stated: 
  "One thing is sure: We shall have to look deeper into the 
arguments presented by the Greek Government. As far as the 
European Commission is concerned, we shall review them as soon 
as we get the message from Prime Minister Papandreou, and then 
we shall also try to see the possible consequences. 
  "I must repeat that we are very much concerned about the 
possible negative effect of these measures on the country and 
the stability in the region, and apparently we shall have to 
follow the situation very closely. 
  "It is also clear that the problem standing behind them 
should keep our attention," van den Broek said. "I repeat, if 
the question about the measures can be solved, then I shall be a 
greater optimist and I shall have greater hopes that there will 
be clear perspectives for ending this dispute, this struggle, 
which is a bad thing for both countries, as well as for the 
security and stability in the region." 
  The Greek journalists wanted to know whether the European 
Union would sign a commercial agreement with Macedonia. Van den 
Broek replied he certainly hoped it could be possible, because 
the Union has signed agreements with other countries, too. "We 
need a consensus for this," he said, "but my experience is that 
a commercial cooperation with this country is important for the 
future and we shall urge the things as much as possible. 
Nevertheless, I also have the feeling that significant progress 
in the solution of the bilateral problems must be achieved, and 
I am convinced that we shall undounbtedly receive cooperation 
for that from this government." 
  Despite the fact that van den Broek did not answer the 
question whether and when he would visit Skopje and Athens 
again, as we have found out, that possibility remains open and 
real. 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  It Is Difficult To Talk Under Embargo </H5>
  Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski escorted Mr. 
van den Broek to Skopje Airport and gave a short statement. 
  Asked about the results after the visit of van den Broek, 
Crvenkovski answered that long discussions were held with the 
European Commissioner and that he was very well acquainted with 
our stances expressed at the meeting of yesterday and the one of 
two days ago. "On our side," Crvenkovski said, "we explicitly 
stated we were ready to cooperate with him in solving all these 
problems. Nonetheless, we were also explicit that we find 
ourselves in an almost impossible situation to continue normally 
any discussions under the pressure of the embargo." 
  Concerning the possible positive elements in 
Macedonian-Greek 
relations, Crvenkovski assessed that there are positive elements 
in the very fact that van den Broek was engaged in the 
discussions and in the fact that the European Union was engaged 
in searching for an outcome of the whole situation. "Moreover," 
Crvenkovski said, "Mr. van den Broek is in constant contact with 
Mr. Cyrus Vance in New York, who is the main mediator in the 
dispute, and it certainly is a positive element. At this 
moment, I am really not able to say anything more."

<F P=106> [Report by Nevenka Jovicic] </F>
  [Text] Judging by everything, it appears that Moscow is 
taking the initiative in resolving the strained relations 
between Athens and Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM], which will, if it proves as successful as 
in the recent Russian action that stopped NATO bombing in 
Bosnia, confirm the authority and power of the new Russian 
foreign policy. 
  The announcement of Russian mediation in a dispute in the 
south of Balkans will not please the West and NATO in the least. 
They are, according to what the weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS 
writes today, already rather alarmed by Russia's rapid and 
unexpected diplomatic offensive. 
  Although Greece's official reply to Moscow's proposal to 
mediate in resolving the dispute with Skopje has not been made 
public here, TO VIMA announces the beginning of a new action by 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who is already supposed 
to visit FYROM next week. 
  This latest move by Moscow in an area of the Balkans in 
which 
Washington and NATO have shown such an open interest will cause 
new worries for the West, political circles here assess. It is 
also being pointed out that the worries of the West will be even 
greater as this latest Russian diplomatic action confirms the 
increasingly closer links between Russia and Greece, which are 
drawn together by friendship between peoples, the same religion, 
and historic roots. 
  The West's fears of Russia's growing role have already 
resulted in the so-called Partnership for Peace agreement 
starting to take the shape of an association of countries based 
on exclusively anti-Russian orientation, TO VIMA comments. 
  Greece itself announces a much more active and aggressive 
policy in the Balkans to protect its national interest. 
According to Khristos Saliberis, chief of the Greek General 
Staff, carried by today's TO VIMA, Greek policy is moving from 
the defensive to the offensive, which basically means the 
neutralization of aggressive neighbors like Turkey and 
protection of Greeks from Epirus to Cyprus.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Greek punitive blockade 
is not only causing serious economic damage in Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], a country that 
has been strangled by Yugoslavia's disintegration, the wars in 
Croatia and Bosnia, and the UN embargo against Serbia. The 
economic situation is desperate and the political consequences 
are unpredictable, says Petrus Stefanov, economics minister in 
Skopje. 
  [Begin Stefanov recording, in Macedonian with superimposed 
translation into German] The blockade is seriously endangering 
our economy, but it also affects the overall political 
situation. It is a direct attack on the stability of the whole 
region. [end recording] 
  The nationalist opposition in Macedonia sees all its fears 
confirmed. Ljupco Georgijevksi from the Internal Macedonian 
Revolutionary Organization says: 
  [Begin Georgijevski recording, in Macedonian with 
superimposed translation into German] The decision of the Greek 
Government has not surprised me very much. It is the logical 
consequence of the Greek policies of the past three years. I 
would not be surprised either if Athens were to resort to 
military means. This is a cold war against Macedonia, a cold 
war which is aggravating the conflicts in the whole of the 
Balkans and also has consequences for Europe. Accordingly, we 
deplore that the European Community is not doing enough. [end

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, Feb 27 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Foreign 
Minister Vladislav Jovanovic expressed fear on Sunday that no 
peaceful motives stood behind the pressures on the Bosnian 
Moslems and Croats to renew their alliance. In a statement to 
the Kragujevac radio, Jovanovic warned that a strategy of 
forming an alliance between the two Bosnian peoples against the 
third (Bosnian Serbs) would lead to further escalation of the 
crisis and the continuation of war. 
  The Yugoslav foreign minister lent support to any effort 
towards narrowing differences between any of two peoples in the 
former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, except those 
motived by the formation of alliance against a third people. 
  Jovanovic said he was confident that on the Croat side those 
forces interested in peace are stronger than those which would 
like to seek their chance in some new war adventure. 
  At the initiative of Washington, the talks between Croatia, 
the Bosnian Croats and Moslems on a common Bosnian Croat-Moslem 
state opened on Saturday. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, February 27 (TANJUG) -- Radmilo 
Bogdanovic, the president of the Serbian Assembly Committee for 
Relations with Serbs outside Serbia, said on Saturday that the 
model of a Moslem-Croat alliance which was being negotiated in 
Washington was not in the spirit of a peaceful solution for the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  That is why such a plan is not encouraging, he said. If it 
is realized, the position of Serbs will become unfavourable, 
Bogdanovic told the local radio station in Jagodina, central 
Serbia. 
  "Taking into consideration the United States support, 
Moslems 
might get even greater appetites for new territorial 
concessions, and Croatia might try to realize through war that 
which the West has allegedly promised it -- a quick solution to 
the problem of the Croatian territory under Serb control," he 
warned. 
  "This would lead to a new aggravation of the conflict, which 
we are absolutely against," Bogdanovic underscored. The people 
and the leaderships of the Bosnian Serb Republic and the 
Republic of Serb Krajina "certainly cannot accept that," 
Bogdanovic said. 
  The Republic of Serb Krajina was proclaimed by Serbs in 1991 
in parts of the territory of Croatia where they are the majority 
population in answer to Croatia's forcible secession from the 
former Yugoslav Federation. In early 1992, Krajina was 
proclaimed a United Nations Protected Area. 
  "It is our stand that weapons should be laid down wherever 
there is bloodshed, and that a solution which is just and equal 
for all and not detrimental to any of the warring sides should 
be embraced," Bogdanovic said. 
  Tri-partite talks between Croatia, Bosnian Croats and 
Bosnian 
Moslems, with the mediation of the United States, on a joint 
Croat-Moslem state in Bosnia-Herzegovina began in Washington on 
Saturday. Under the Washington plan, Moslems and Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina would form a joint state entity. Such a 
community would then enter into a confederation with 
neighbouring Croatia, to which Croatian President Franjo Tudjman 
already agreed in principle on Thursday.

<F P=106> [Report by Shefqet Rexhepj on news conference given by </F>
Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova, in 
Prishtina on 25 February: "We Do Not Want the Logic of Yalta To 
Be Repeated"] 
  [Text] Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of 
Kosova, began yesterday's news conference in Prishtina by 
welcoming U.S. President Clinton's statement, which included the 
question of Kosova and its settlement, as well as the issue of 
repression in Kosova, as part of the package on the Bosni 
ultimatum. This is very important, Ibrahim Rugova said, because 
it means that Kosova is not being forgotten and will not be left 
to one side in the context of the overall settlements that will 
be achieved. He then returned to everyday life in Kosova, which 
is extremely difficult and fraught with severe repressions, as 
we see in the draconian sentences meted out to dozens of 
Albanians, totalling hundreds of years, as in the trial the day 
before yesterday in Prishtina. 
<H5>  The Academy Exists for Us and the World </H5>
  Unfortunately, the now familiar process of political show 
trials, that has left behind such scars and trauma, is still 
continuing in Kosova. Everything is being done in order to 
discredit our peaceful movement of nonviolent resistance and to 
erode the sympathy we enjoy in the world, a sympathy that will 
contribute to a peaceful solution of the problem of Kosova. We 
repeat these things in order to make clear the true aim of this 
smear campaign, which will not have any success. Ibrahim Rugova 
went on to mention the closure of the premises of the Kosova 
Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Serbian police's 
confiscation of its assets. We have nevertheless decided that 
the academy will continue its work. For us and for the world, 
the Kosova Academy still exists, and is linked with many world 
academic institutions and universities. 
  Raids on Kosova villages are continuing as ever, such as in 
the communes of Istog, Kline, Ferizaj [Urosevac], Shtime, 
Lipjan, Fuse Kosove [Kosovo Polje], Malisheve, Peje [Pec], 
Skenderaj [Srvica], Vushtrri [Vucitrn], and Kacanik. This 
repression has been continuing particularly in the communes of 
Kline, Podujeve, and Mitrovice, and its purpose is both to shake 
the Albanians' out of their convictions and to harm them 
economically. Repression is continuing against political 
activists and especially against schools and teachers. All this 
is raising political tensions in Kosova, and we appeal, 
President Rugova said, for preventive measures against 
repression in Kosova. 
  Talking about the recent initiatives for a settlement to the 
problems of the former Yugoslavia, Ibrahim Rugova said that 
Yeltsin's initiative should not supplant a comprehensive 
settlement, or replace a conference for the overall solution of 
these problems which all sides would attend. We do not want the 
logic of Yalta to repeat itself and prevail again in the 
Balkans, especially in the former Yugoslavia. We do not want 
the reappearance of various spheres of interest, which would 
hamper tendencies both toward fragmentation and integration, or, 
we would rather say, the process of reorganizing the Balkans. I 
think that the Russian role in the Balkans should not be biased, 
but should be on the basis of the international standards and 
principles of the United Nations and European institutions. 
Ibrahim Rugova went on to welcome Sali Berisha's visit to 
Brussels and his signature of the Partnership for Peace 
agreement, which is a very important step for Albania's 
integration in Europe and the protection of her security. I 
also appreciate highly and welcome the report of UN special 
envoy Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who devoted an entire chapter to the 
general situation and the discrimination in Kosova. 
<H5>  The Political Parties Are Not Closed to Any Class </H5>
  Ibrahim Rugova went on to reply to various questions from 
journalists. Asked what he thought of Albania's participation 
in NATO's peacekeeping work, Ibrahim Rugova replied that this 
would be a positive development, because Albania is a 
geopolitically interesting country, not only for the Balkans and 
the Mediterranean, but for Europe. Besides having a positive 
effect on the Albanians, this would also help to balance forces 
in the Balkans. Asked what he thought of the proposal to create 
a Muslim-Croatian confederation in Bosnia and how this would 
affect Kosova, Ibrahim Rugova said that Christopher had proposed 
this, although it was present as a suggestion even before, when 
unavailing efforts were being made to create a Croatian-Muslim 
coalition. If Bosnia is divided on ethnic lines, then 
confederations of various kinds will be possible. Meanwhile, 
drawing parallels with Kosova, he said that the Albanian 
political parties possess documents about the three well-known 
options on the status of Kosova. Of course, confederations of 
various kinds would be open to the Albanians too. 
  Asked about the role of the Coordinating Council of 
Albanian Political Parties and his own personal role in 
surmounting various kinds of polarization in Kosova, President 
Rugova said that the Coordinating Council agreed about overall 
issues in Kosova and the Albanian territories. There also 
exists a council of the parties from all the Albanian 
territories of the former Yugoslavia. Important decisions have 
been made about the status of Kosova and the Albanians in other 
areas. I myself have been involved in this council. Of course, 
it should be more active. We have done a great deal of work on 
issues in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM]. Both the council and I myself wanted a common 
congress to be held in order to overcome divisions, but the 
congress took place with various fractions. We must not 
overdramatize this, because such things are possible in 
political life. Political parties must be in the swim of 
political events, rather than being self-involved. There must 
be greater understanding. A common language must be found over 
the most essential issues, on the basis of democratic 
principles. I say democratic principles, even though this has 
become a little stale, but I want to say on the basis of human 
decency. Work should be done on the basis of agreement, because 
there can be no political life without agreement. Meanwhile, 
talking about some of the Albanians' political organizations, he 
said that the Albanians are in favor of political organization. 
I have repeated several times that we have set out to be a 
political nation in the positive sense of the word, not a 
politicized people, but a political people, which means that we 
have an organized and guided political life. Of course, there 
will be minor upheavals, but we must work on all issues on a 
basis of understanding. 
  Asked what he thought of the return of former Kosova 
politicians to the Kosova political scene, President Rugova said 
that the former Kosova politicians had been present, and they 
can make their contribution if they wish. They can involve 
themselves in politics, because the political parties of Kosova 
are not closed to any section of Kosova society. Meanwhile, in 
reply to a question about what he thought of the recent trial, 
at which the personalities of the Kosova leadership were 
mentioned, Rugova said that it is not true that a defense 
ministry exists, as was claimed, or any other ministry. Anton 
Kola and even myself were mentioned at these political show 
trials, but facts demonstrate that these are shams whose purpose 
is to discredit the personalities of the Kosova Democratic 
Alliance and the other Albanian political parties. 
<H5>  Kosova Will Be Open </H5>
  Asked whether talks with the Serbian side are expected soon, 
Rugova said that there are no signs of talks. We have 
attempted, he said, within the framework of the Geneva 
Conference, to talk about various specific issues concerning 
people's lives in Kosova, such as education and health, but we 
achieved no success. Meanwhile, our standpoints are well known, 
and of course Serbia too has its own views. Our stand is for an 
independent and neutral Kosova. 
  This [passage illegible] I often mentioned, Ibrahim Rugova 
went on to emphasize, that Kosova will be open to both Serbia 
and Albania, and we must inevitably reconcile ourselves to this 
fact. This would be the compromise of the Albanian side. We are 
all burdened with the past, with Berlin Walls here in the 
Balkans. I often say that Kosova will remain here and will not 
go to the moon. It will be close to Serbia, to the Serbs, to 
Albania, FYROM, ETC. Meanwhile, concerning the question of a 
parallel according to ethnic lines in Bosnia and Kosova, Ibrahim 
Rugova said that ethnic lines are valid for other people too in 
the former Yugoslavia and the Balkans; asked whether these lines 
would stretch to certain communes in southern Serbia, Rugova 
made no comment.

  [Text] [Announcer] Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, president of the 
republic of Kosova, gave a news conference in Prishtina today. 
Let us go to a report by Leke Musolli: 
  [Musolli] In today's news conference Ibrahim Rugova, 
president of the republic of Kosova, first welcomed the attitude 
of U.S. President Bill Clinton for not leaving the question of 
Kosova out of the ultimatum addressed to Serbs. With this, it 
is seen that Kosova and the Albanian question will take their 
rightful place in the final solution to the crisis in former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Rugova then briefed reporters on the present reality in 
Kosova, characterized as it is by Serbian police violence and 
terror. Recently, the Serbian courts convicted dozens of 
Albanians to more than 100 years of imprisonment on trumped-up 
charges. President Rugova said that this violence by the 
Serbian police aims to imprison Albanians and compromise their 
peaceful policy for resolving the question of Kosova. 
  Rugova illustrated the intensity of the police violence with 
the closure of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of the republic 
of Kosova. However, in spite of this, the Academy of Sciences 
and Arts of the Republic of Kosova will continue to exist and 
will continue to work and cooperate with all the foreign 
academies, as it has been doing for many years. This shameful 
act and the recent police repression have increased the tension 
in Kosova. That is why president Rugova invited the public and 
international diplomats to take steps to prevent any possible 
conflict in Kosova. 
  Speaking about the recent initiatives on solutions to the 
problems in former Yugoslavia, Dr. Rugova concentrated on that 
of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Rugova said that we would 
not like this to replace the initiative for a global solution of 
the problems in former Yugoslavia and that we do not want 
another Yalta in the Balkans. Mr. Rugova said that we would not 
like the role of the Russian factor in this region to be 
one-sided. President Rugova said that the Balkans should not be 
considered as a region of spheres of interest. On the contrary, 
it should be seen as a sphere of integrating processes. 
  At today's news conference, President Rugova welcomed the 
visit of Albanian President Dr. Sali Berisha to Brussels and 
added that signing the Partnership for Peace agreement will be 
important not only for Albanians but for the whole region. He 
also greeted the report by the special envoy of the UN secretary 
general, Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, which objectively described the 
violation of human rights and freedoms in Kosova. 
  At the news conference, Mr. Rugova answered many reporters' 
questions.

  [Excerpts] Slovak Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik gave a 
news conference late this morning, probably his last as foreign 
minister. Journalists' questions concentrated mostly on the link 
between the internal political situation in Slovakia and 
Slovakia's international standing. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Moravcik recording] Foreign countries have been 
monitoring the situation in our country very carefully. They 
have drawn one conclusion from our internal situation: that 
there is a trend here to implement certain elements of an 
authoritarian regime. This is one negative factor. 
  The second factor is the fact that statements by some 
politicians--above all, by the prime minister--are frequently 
ambiguous. This makes our internal politics rather 
incomprehensible, and this, of course, influences the 
conclusions drawn by foreign countries as regards their attitude 
toward our country. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The government aircraft carrying Slovak Prime 
Minister Vladimir Meciar and his entourage made two stopovers on 
the way back from China so that our leaders could have more 
political talks. 
  During the stopover at the airport in Karachi in southern 
Pakistan, Vladimir Meciar was received by a minister authorized 
by Prime Minister Bhutto, who was on a foreign trip at the time. 
Apart from political and economic issues, they discussed 
cooperation in tourism. In this respect, the Pakistani side was 
interested in the conditions for foreign capital entry into our 
market. A government delegation and a group of businessmen will 
come to Slovakia and examine the potential and forms of possible 
capital investments in our country. 
  The government aircraft landed in Ankara after a four-hour 
flight from Karachi. Vladimir Meciar met Turkish Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin there. Their conversation, which lasted 
approximately 30 minutes, focused, apart from political issues, 
on the problems of forming a Slovak-Turkish intergovernmental 
commission for economic cooperation. One of the other topics 
they discussed was a joint armaments program and the drafting of 
a plan on cooperation in the sphere of building oil and gas 
pipelines. The two sides also agreed that it was necessary to 
prepare a new cultural agreement. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar has described the 
mutual granting of most-favored-nation status as the greatest 
success of his official visit to the People's Republic of China. 
He said this at a news conference at Bratislava airport, 
immediately after the return of the Slovak delegation. The 
prifme minister considers Thailand to be an important trade and 
economic partner, too. According to Meciar, Slovakia has 
achieved a certain opening with regard to relations with Turkey, 
and Pakistani officials are also showing an interest in visiting 
Slovakia. 
  At the news conference, the prime minister refused to 
comment 
on the resignations of Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac and 
Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik. He said that so far he has not 
heard President's Kovac's stand and that he has not yet gathered 
enough information about the matter. He also failed to comment 
on the alleged statements by Jan Slota, the newly elected 
chairman of the Slovak National Party [SNS], who is said to have 
expressed admiration of Russian ultranationalist Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy. The prime minister stressed that the SNS 
continues to be the coalition partner of the HZDS [Movement for 
a Democratic Slovakia]. 
  A trend toward implementing elements of an authoritarian 
regime is what is emerging when the internal political situation 
in Slovakia is assessed abroad. This was said by Foreign 
Minister Jozef Moravcik at a news conference in Bratislava. He 
said that, if this proves to be true, Slovakia's position 
abroad, with regard to its integration into Europe, would 
suffer. Jozef Moravcik expressed the view that Slovakia's 
foreign policy orientation will be preserved because Slovakia 
has already taken important international legal steps in that 
direction, such as signing the association agreement with the 
European Union and the umbrella agreement on participating in 
the Partnership for Peace program.

  [Text] Our colleague Bernard Hornak is on the line from an 
extraordinary news conference given by Deputy Prime Minister 
Roman Kovac, who has resigned from his post. 
  [Hornak] At the opening of his news conference, Roman Kovac 
confirmed that at 0900 today he handed his resignation letter to 
President Michal Kovac. He repeated the reasons for his 
resignation. The main reason he gave was that he did not wish 
to be the cause of increased tension in our society. Neither 
did he want to see yet another wave of confrontation between the 
Cabinet and the president. 
  Answering a question as to what in his view is the future of 
the Alternative of Political Realism, Roman Kovac said that the 
Alternative was formed within the HZDS [Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia]. It has proposed a certain solution to the 
political crisis and has called for a return to democratic 
principles. At present, those deputies who have subscribed to 
the ideas of the Alternative are not changing their view. 
  Speaking about his future political line, Roman Kovac said 
that Slovakia needs a consensus and that, at present, on the 
basis of that consensus, he has held talks with the 
representatives of the National-Democratic Club [of the Slovak 
National Party], the Alliance of Democrats, and some 
nonparliamentary parties. 
  This is all for the time being from the presidium of the 
government.

  [Text] At a news conference in Bratislava today, Slovak 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Moravcik reaffirmed his 
intention not to leave Slovak politics. Together with the group 
that, as a part of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, 
supported the Alternative of Political Realism, he intends to 
form a strong bloc oriented at the center of the political 
spectrum. This group counts on Cernak's [National Democratic] 
wing of the Slovak National Party and on the Alliance of 
Democrats of the Slovak Republic. But talks with other parties 
are also in progress. 
  Asked how he sees frequent changes in the post of Slovak 
foreign minister, inasmuch as in other countries foreign 
ministers retain their posts regardless of changes in the 
composition of elected coalitions, Jozef Moravcik said: A 
mechanism allowing this practice to be implemented should be 
created in Slovakia. Slovak foreign policy does not benefit 
from frequent changes.

  [Excerpts] Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac gave a 
news conference today in connection with his decision to resign. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Peter 
Tomecek, 
another member of the Alternative of Political Realism has left 
your group. How do you see the future of this Alternative? 
  [Kovac] [passage omitted] I think that all of us who formed 
the Alternative know that there is a need to clean up this 
society, and I think they will maintain their position [on this 
issue]. We will be short one person, but that does not matter. 
  [Correspondent] You said that you were preparing a new 
political party. You have been having talks with various 
parliamentary parties. There has been some information from the 
lobbies that your views are close to that of Mr. Cernak [leader 
of the National Democratic Faction in the Slovak National 
Party]. Can you tell us more about the orientation of this new 
political entity, or, in other words, with whom would you be 
willing to cooperate? 
  [Kovac] The main reason for considering the creation of a 
new 
political party is the existence of a large group of citizens in 
Slovakia who are dissatisfied with all of the existing political 
parties. According to our analysis of public opinion, the main 
reason for this dissatisfaction is the inability of political 
forces to reach a sensible agreement. The political party we 
have in mind is a party that should be a new beginning, or a 
guarantee that a sensible political agreement is reached between 
Slovak political forces. That is what Slovakia needs more than 
anything at the present time. 
  [Correspondent] When will we hear more about it? 
  [Kovac] Maybe by the end of next week. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report on a telephone interview with Jozef Stank, Slovak </F>
charge d'affaires in Prague, by Marian Ondas on 25 February] 
  [Excerpt] [Ondas] Slovak Ambassador Ivan Mjartan had talks 
at the Slovak Embassy in Prague today with Czech Minister Igor 
Nemec about topical issues concerning the concept of the Czech 
Government's policy on minorities policy and its relationship 
with minorities on the current Czech political scene. I have 
had a telephone conversation with Jozef Stank, the Slovak charge 
d'affaires, about some areas that were discussed today. 
  [Begin recording] [Stank] During the meeting with Minister 
Nemec, who is, among other things, in charge of the council for 
minorities as well as the council for scientific and 
technological development, we discussed above all the document 
whose concept had been approved recently by the Czech Government 
and that deals with the problem of national minorities. What is 
interesting for us in this document is, above all, the premise 
stating that a member of any national minority is above all a 
citizen of the Czech Republic [CR], and he is perceived as such 
from this civic principle. The best protection of the rights of 
members of national minorities is a democratic and legal system 
that guarantees the protection of the rights of all citizens. 
  [Ondas] I would like to ask: Did you find a common language 
in the key questions with your Czech partners? 
  [Stank] Let us say it frankly. This civic principle used in 
relation to national minorities is to a certain extent very 
interesting for us, and I think it could provide a certain 
alternative or certain understanding, certain approach also for 
us in this area. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] The central council of the Slovak National Party 
[SNS], which was holding its meeting in Ruzomberok today, was 
setting up a new organizational structure of the party. (Eva 
Slavkovska) has been elected first deputy chairwoman, (Juraj 
Molnar) has been elected second chairman of the SNS, and (Zuzana 
Tvrda) was made central secretary. 
  Jozef Prokes, honorary chairman of the party, said that, 
after the extraordinary congress [19-20 February] in Zilina, 
approximately 10 percent of the over-6,000-strong party left the 
SNS with Ludovit Cernak [former SNS chairman]. 
  The immediate objective of the party is to revive the 
party's 
activity, to start off the work of the new executive, which has 
shrunk from 19 to nine members, and to get ready for the setting 
up of a preelection coalition. In this respect, Jozef Prokes 
said that the SNS would not enter into coalition with the Party 
of the Democratic Left, the Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement, and Coexistence. He was not able to say yet who would 
be the election partner of the SNS. Jozef Prokes went on to say 
that parliamentary elections were the fastest and most stable 
solution to the current situation. As to the future orientation 
of the SNS on the political scene, Jozef Prokes said that the 
party wanted to clearly declare its views. He said the party 
would be more straightforward than up until now because the past 
policy of Ludovit Cernak was not clear, and it could not answer 
the question of whether the SNS was in coalition or in 
opposition.

<F P=106> [Interview with Egyutteles Chairman Miklos Duray by Anna </F>
Vargova; place and date not given: "A Power and Financial 
Struggle"] 
  [Text] [Vargova] Mr. Chairman, J. Carnogursky said in an 
interview for SLOVENSKY DENNIK last week that it would be no 
problem to recall the government. The main problem would be to 
form a government that was not dependent on the votes of the 
Hungarian deputies. It seems that, at the moment, you and the 
opposition cannot find common ground.... 
  [Duray] Your observation is correct from both the political 
and the tactical points of view. If the participation in the 
government of a specific political structure is not being given 
consideration, there is not sufficient reason for talking about 
support for a government in which it will not be represented. A 
vote of no confidence in V. Meciar is not connected with support 
for another government. This issue is associated with the 
political legitimacy of the parties in parliament, of which 
none, apart from the Slovak National Party, had an independent 
state in its program. 
  The fact that the government of the current prime minister 
has abused its power is something else. It wants to place 
economically loyal people around itself--loyal on account of 
their share in privatization. This is in fact causing cracks in 
the opposition, which is also interested in a share of 
privatization so that it can reward its supporters with "gifts" 
from it. This is partially a power and partially a financial 
struggle. 
  [Vargova] Mr. Duka-Zolyomi has emphasized that, if a grand 
coalition was discussed at the opposition's talks last year, it 
was a grand coalition in the broadest sense of the word. Does 
this mean that you were given specific promises? 
  [Duray] No one discussed a grand coalition with us. We 
declared our readiness to take part in such a government, but we 
received no offer. If I remember correctly, a grand coalition 
has been on the agenda since the beginning of last December, 
and, since that time, it has been clear that no consideration is 
being given to our participation in it. 
  [Vargova] If the situation were to change, which department 
would you be interested in? 
  [Duray] We are prepared for certain posts, including 
ministerial ones, in health care, the economy, education, and 
culture. We have experts capable of filling such posts, and I 
am convinced that they will do better than the current 
government.

<F P=106> [Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 3d Corps report from Zenica] </F>
  [Excerpt] Much more is needed for peace than just 
signatures on a piece of paper, most of all it requires the 
goodwill of the commanders of military units on the ground. We 
do not want to believe that one thing is agreed at the 
negotiating table while another thing is told the military 
commanders, those who implement the cease-fire. However, how 
else can we explain the bombing of the Novi Travnik Bratstvo 
[Brotherhood] factory from aircraft of the Croatian Army, as 
happened this morning at 0648 [0548 GMT]? Is there any 
justification for daily overflights of helicopters of the

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 28 (AFP) -- Four Serbian Galeb 
aircraft were shot down by U.S. fighters near the northwestern 
town of town of Banja Luka early Monday [28 February], a NATO 
military spokesman confirmed here. 
  Earlier Admiral Chistos Liberis, the chief of staff of the 
Greek armed forces, announced in Athens that the four Serbian 
aircraft were downed 55 miles (90 kilometers) west of Banja Luka 
between 0430 GMT and 0500 GMT. 
  The NATO spokesman said the Serbian aircraft had ignored 
orders to land relayed to them by NATO aircraft enforcing a 
no-flight ban over Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of operation Deny 
Flight. 
  In Athens, Admiral Liberis made the announcement to 
journalists who were awaiting the end of talks between Defense 
Minister Gerassimos Arsenis and visiting British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd. 
  In Sarajevo, UN sources said a Serbian aircraft was shot 
down 
by NATO aircraft over the central town of Zenica early Monday 
morning. The Serbian plane had taken off from Banja Luka, they 
added. 
  A spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees said the humanitarian airlift into Sarajevo and all 
movements to Serb-controlled areas were being suspended.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 28 (AFP) -- The six Bosnian Serb planes 
intercepted Monday by NATO warplanes which shot down four of 
them had taken off from the northwestern Serb-held airport of 
Banja Luka, a French military source said. 
  The six Super Galeb aircraft were in the air a short period 
when they were spotted by an AWACS radar plane which relayed 
their location to two US F-16 fighter jets, the source said. He 
added that the order to shoot down the planes was given by the 
NATO headquarters in Italy after the Bosnian Serb planes ignored 
orders to land. 
  Earlier, the [French] Defense Ministry here said the Galeb 
aircraft were in the process of bombing a Moslem-operated 
weapons factory near the central town of Vitez when four of them 
were shot down. 
  Speaking in Mostar in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, UN 
special 
representative for the former Yugoslavia Yasuchi Akashi said he 
"understood that (the) two other planes landed in Banja Luka 
airport." 
  Akashi added that he had contacted Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic and the two had agreed "on the importance of 
not overdramatising this particular incident." 
  The Bosnian Serbs have often been accused of using the Banja 
Luka airport for helicopter flights which were in violation of a 
UN no-flight ban over Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Although the flights were detected by AWACS radar planes, 
NATO jets could not intervene as the helicopters were flying low 
and in moutainous regions.

  [Text] Belgrade, 28 Feb (EFE) -- The Srpska armed forces 
today stated that the four planes which were downed by U.S. 
fighters at 0545 GMT today near Banja Luka, the largest Serbian 
city in Bosnia, were not Serbian. 
  Neboysa Radmanovic, press chief of Banja Luka, a city 232 km 
north of Sarajevo, told the journalists that no Serbian military 
planes took off today. 
  The press office of the Bosnian (Muslim) Third Army Corps 
confirmed that Croatian planes today bombed the Brastvo factory 
in Travnik, central Bosnia, and observers do not rule out the 
possibility that these were the planes that were later downed. 
  Most observers seem to agree that the downed planes belonged 
to the Bosnian Serbs, but they do not rule out the possibility 
that they may be part of the small number of Croatian planes. 
Serbian and Croatian pilots have been trained at the same 
schools and use the same type of planes in the now extinct 
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  The U.S. fighter planes carried out their operation against 
the Yugoslav-made Galeb (swallows) training planes, in keeping 
with Resolution 816 of the UN Security Council dated 1 March 
1993. 
  This resolution, which received 14 votes in favor while only 
the PRC abstained, allows the Security Council to begin the 
so-called "Closed Sky" operation against Bosnian-Serb planes. 
  Since the Croats and the Muslims virtually have no planes, 
the some 45 Serb planes and helicopters which usually use the 
Banja Luka airport in northern Sarajevo, own the sky. 
  The United Nations has thus authorized NATO to continuously 
overfly Bosnian territory with permission from President Alia 
Izetbegovic, the only person the United Nations recognizes as a 
representative of divided Bosnia.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 28 (TANJUG) -- Hours have elapsed 
since the downing of four aircraft over the Banja Luka region in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on Monday morning, but it has not been 
established yet whose the aircraft were. 
  NATO has so far given only the basic elements about the 
operation carried out on Monday morning by U.S. Phantoms. The 
official NATO statement said that the operation took place at 
around 07:00 hours local time, and that two F-16s fighters shot 
down four aircraft near Banja Luka. 
  No other facts are known for the time being. It is not known 
precisely which type of planes were downed, to whom they had 
belonged, and from where they had taken off. 
  World media have neverthless been alleging since early 
morning that the planes belonged to the Bosnian Serb republic 
(R.S.), that they were Galebs, and had violated the U.N.-imposed 
no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Two categorical denials have so far come from the R.S. that 
the downed planes were not Bosnian Serb. The denials have not, 
however, stopped foreign media from alleging that they belonged 
to the Serb Republic. 
  TANJUG was told in Bosnian Serb army (VRS) circles that the 
VRS had only one airfield, near Banja Luka, and that U.N. 
military observers had been stationed there for quite some time. 
The same sources underscored that U.N. military observers would 
have no doubt seen if any VRS planes had taken off from the 
airfield on Monday morning. 
  The VRS sources denied that any VRS aircraft had been 
downed, 
which they said could be confirmed by U.N. military observers. 
  Moslem-controlled Radio Sarajevo early on Monday morning 
said 
that Croat forces bombed the towns of Vitez and Novi Travnik, 
and that afterwards, at 06:15 hours local time to be exact, Serb 
planes raided the town of Bugojno. 
  The same source said that Croat planes attacked the 
ammunition factory in Novi Travnik at 5:58 GMT, i.e. ten minutes 
after the downing of the allegedly Serb planes. Unidentified 
French military sources, which have been quoted by some foreign 
news agencies, have created additional confusion by alleging 
that the ammunition factory was bombed by Serb plames. 
  Naturally, it is hard to believe that the missing elements 
concerning the four downed planes will not be filled in. 
However, things are repeating themselves. The Bosnian Serbs 
are again being blamed in advance, before the necessary facts 
have been established. The same was true in the case of the 
massacres in Sarajevo's Vase Miskina Street and again recently 
at Sarajevo's Markale open air market. 
  The downing of the four planes on Monday morning was NATO's 
first combat operation since the military alliance was founded 
in 1949. Although the two U.N. Security Council resolutions 
relating to the no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina are invoked 
to justify the operation, it is a clear indication that NATO was 
not at all happy at not having had the opportunity militarily to 
act after the expiry of the NATO ultimatum set to the Bosnian 
Serbs. It has been conceded even in western political circles 
that the thwarting of NATO air strikes was Russia's diplomatic 
victory. 
  The question which presents itself in that context is 
whether 
the Monday morning operation was an attempt to get even with 
Russia.

  [Excerpts] Brussels, Feb 28 (AFP) -- U.S. F-16 fighters 
shot down four Serbian aircraft early Monday near the 
northwestern Bosnian town of Banja Luka for violating a NATO 
no-flight ban over Bosnia-Herzegovina, NATO said here. 
  The French Defense Ministry said a total of six Serbian 
Galeb 
jets were in the process of shelling a weapons factory near the 
central Bosnian town of Vitez when NATO warplanes intervened and 
downed four of the aircraft. 
  A NATO spokesman here said the six Serbian aircraft had 
ignored orders to land and four of them were shot down at 0548 
GMT by the two U.S. F-16 Flying Falcons which fired six missiles 
and then safely returned to their base in Aviano, Italy. 
  "The NATO pilots issued, in accordance with their rules of 
engagement, two `land or be engaged' orders to the aircraft, 
which ignored them," a NATO communique issued in Italy said. 
"The NATO Flying Falcons engaged the planes, shooting down four 
of them." [passage omitted] 
  In Sarajevo, UN sources said one of the Galeb aircraft was 
shot down over the central town of Zenica after taking off from 
Banja Luka. 
  A Serb military official in Banja Luka said, "we cannot 
either confirm or deny for the time being" that any Serb jets 
had been shot down, and he asserted that Serb planes had abided 
by operation Deny Flight. 
  NATO aircraft have been flying daily sorties over Bosnia 
since April 1993 to enforce UN resolution 816 banning all 
unauthorized flights over the war-torn former Yugoslav republic. 
The UN ban has however been repeatedly been violated by Serb 
aircraft. The NATO spokesman said Resolution 816 authorized 
"all necessary measures" to ensure respect of the no-flight ban. 
  In Athens, Liberis told journalists that he regretted the 
shooting down of the Serb planes and said the incident 
"justifies our decision not to be involved in any military 
operations in Bosnia." He recalled that Greek crews had been 
pulled out of allied AWACS radar planes after Athens dissociated 
itself from a NATO ultimatum threatening air strikes against all 
heavy weapons not withdrawn from around Sarajevo or placed under 
UN control by February 21. 
  Pressured by this ultimatum, Bosnian Serb forces besieging 
Sarajevo and mainly Moslem Bosnian army declared a ceasefire on 
February 9, the same day the NATO deadline was issued. 
  A spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees said in Sarajevo that the humanitarian airlift into the 
Bosnian capital and all movements to Serb-controlled areas were 
being suspended in the wake of the downing of the four Serbian 
aircraft.

<F P=106> [Interview with Presidency member Ejup Ganic by Ratka </F>
Tenjovic in Sarajevo on 28 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Tenjovic] Professor Ganic, how did the Presidency 
assess this morning's downing of four enemy planes? 
  [Ganic] This has restored credibility to the United Nations. 
To put it briefly, this [word indistinct] is beginning to act 
more efficiently. This is not only good news for our state but 
also for other, even smaller states in the world, which have 
always seen the United Nations as a savior and have expected the 
organization's collective protection. Of course, this is a 
positive operation and proof that the United Nations -- once it 
decides to do something -- has the technology to implement (?its 
decisions). 
  [Tenjovic] One of the two UN resolutions was implemented 
this morning. It was said yesterday that from now on, UN 
convoys would be setting out without previous notice and would 
be travelling with an armed escort throughout the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Can we expect that in the future, the 
United Nations will have a more active attitude toward its own 
documents on Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Ganic] Yes, we can because the UN's credibility and 
historical responsibility was extremely threatened. Moreover, 
the carnage is immense and, therefore, the [UN] course has 
changed. The Serbian regime in Bosnia is actually using weapons 
that are killing civilians -- women and children -- destroying 
private houses, yet it does not possess a technology that could 
be a challenge to NATO planes or other NATO equipment. 
Therefore, the only real, effective force on Bosnia-Herzegovina 
territory -- in terms of intervention from the air and on the 
ground -- is the UN force, since we are observing the 
cease-fire. I expect that the Serbian regime, following an old 
recipe, will try to proclaim this to be another of its 
victories, and perhaps (?more significant breakthroughs) will 
occur. Perhaps these planes will be shot down not only over 
Banja Luka but also in places where they are maintained and 
where they prepare for their sorties. 
  [Tenjovic] The message for the aggressor is clear. There 
can be no more joking with the United Nations. What would be 
the message for the Bosnia-Herzegovina citizens? 
  [Ganic] Better times are coming -- Tuzla airport will soon 
be opened and convoys will come more often to (?encircled) 
territories. We cannot relax, however, because the aggressor 
will try [changes thought], you know that crimes against the 
civilian population are (?still going on) in all areas, the 
[Bosnia-Herzegovina] Army must be alert, it must defend its 
positions at all times, it must do everything to help things 
function on the ground, iron out problems between communes, in 
traffic.... However, we must also fight back with our 
efficiency in the sense [words indistinct] of the United 
Nations. Therefore, the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its 
borders are again on the international (?map), and the world 
realizes that partitioning a state, handing over a state to the 
aggressor whose objective is expansionism, simply leads to 
instability not only in these regions but to chaos in 
international diplomacy. Owing primarily to our Army's [word 
indistinct] on the ground, and partly owing to our political 
activity, we have succeeded in channeling many things. [sentence 
as heard] Things will now be somewhat easier, but you must know 
that we cannot afford to relax, [words indistinct].

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmed Begicevic from Novi Travnik] </F>
  [Text] Early this morning the citizens of Novi Travnik and 
Travnik were awoken by a series of powerful explosions. 
According to the information that we have received from the 
Operative Group Bosanska Krajina, this morning at 0645 [0545 
GMT] a group of six Galeb fighter planes bearing the insignia of 
the former Yugoslav People's Army entered the air space of our 
country despite the UN no-fly resolution. Four planes bombed 
the Bratstvo Factory in Novi Travnik, causing considerable 
material damage. 
  Just after this air raid NATO planes appeared in the sky, 
and 
the attackers dispersed and tried to escape in various 
directions. Early morning eye-witnesses in Travnik have 
confirmed that an armed clash took place in the sky, and the 
attackers were attacked by missiles from the NATO planes, which 
were much faster. According to unofficial information [words 
indistinct] two U.S. F-16 fighters.

  [Text] Brussels, 28 February (TANJUG) -- Four Galeb-type 
aircraft were shot down about 50 km west of Banja Luka, an 
official NATO representative confirmed today in Brussels. The 
aircraft that were shot down, according to him, refused prior to 
this to heed a warning and make a forced landing. 
  The official NATO representative stated that U.S. F-16 
fighter aircraft participated as part of NATO forces in the 
shooting down of the planes. He also said the U.S. planes flew 
from one of the bases in Italy. 
  The official NATO representative said first that the planes 
that were shot down either belonged to the "Bosnian Serbs" or to 
Serbia. He later corrected himself, saying that they flew from 
territory controlled by Bosnian Serbs. 
  He also recalled that the NATO planes were authorized to 
take 
action on the basis of the Security Council resolution banning 
flights over Bosnia. This ban, according to him, was infringed 
by a total of six Galeb-type planes, but two planes from this 
group succeeded in avoiding being shot down. 
  The same representative failed to reply to a question as to 
whether this was an isolated incident or an action with more 
serious consequences. He also refused to comment in any other 
way on this incident, of which he said only that it took place 
early this morning.

  [Text] This morning at 0650 [0550 GMT] the chetnik air 
force again bombed residential areas in Bugojno. The air raid 
was carried out in three sweeps, causing great material damage. 
After dropping their load, the chetnik bombers flew off in the 
direction of Donji Vakuf. 
  Since 1745 last night the chetnik artillery has been 
pounding 
the residential areas of Bugojno, and this was repeated early 
this morning during the chetnik air raid. 
  All the defense lines of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 
fighters 
from Operative Group West are firm and alert. 
  As for the Gornji Vakuf front, the cease-fire is largely 
holding, at least as far as the artillery is concerned. Snipers 
are still active, and something should be done about these 
criminals, as that is in the interest of both sides.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Feb 28 (AFP) -- A total of 16 
artillery shells landed in and around the airport in Tuzla in 
northern Bosnia on Monday [28 February] morning, a UN spokesman 
said here. 
  UN Dutch Major Rob Annink said one shell hit an empty 
building and another fell on the runway. 
  He said the shelling came after U.S. jets in central Bosnia 
shot down at 0548 GMT four Serb warplanes who were defying the 
NATO no-flight zone over the former Yugoslav republic. He did 
not specify the time of the shelling in Tuzla. 
  Annink said he could not say if there was a link between the 
two incidents or if the shelling of Tuzla was by Serb forces. 
  Tuzla airport is, however, surrounded by Serb forces who 
have 
said they oppose a UN plan to open the airport in March to 
receive humanitarian aid flights. 
  A French UN officer separately told AFP that a mortar shell 
fell on Sunday near Sarajevo airport, which is held by UN troops. 
  He said the shell fell at 10:00 p.m. (2100 GMT) Sunday, 500 
metres (yards) north of the airport, in what would be a clear 
violation of the NATO ban on heavy weapons in the Sarajevo area. 
[passage omitted] 
  The officer, who asked not to be named, said he could not 
identify where the mortar shell came from. 
  He said three Serb tanks were seen from the airport moving 
northwest at about midnight (2300 GMT Sunday), in what would be 
another violation of the NATO ban.

sporadic Muslim sniper provocations. The army of the Srpska 
republic and UN Protection Forces are contributing toward the 
establishment of peace in this part of former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, high military circles of the Srpska republic 
emphasize. Thanks to Blue Helmet interventions, the Muslims 
have somewhat reduced their engineering works in Sarajevo. 
  As Serbian military circles emphasize, the 2d Corps of the 
so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Army offered cooperation to the 
111th Brigade of the Croatian Defense Council Tuzla, which has 
been increasingly escaping the control of Alija's [Izetbegovic] 
army. The same sources claim that Muslim-Croat clashes continue 
in central Bosnia and in Herzegovina. The second successive 
attempt to form a Croatian-Muslim alliance is only producing 
results in the Sava Basin. Concurrent with the activities of 
the regular Croatian Army from the region of (Rajevo Selo) in 
the Serbian Sava Basin, which directly threaten the corridor, 
the Muslims have been pounding Brcko and its surroundings with 
artillery. 
  Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the Peoples' Assembly of the 
Srpska republic, commented on the efforts to open Dubrave 
airport near Tuzla at all costs as follows: 
  [Begin Krajisnik recording] We have never been opposed to 
the opening of airports and delivery of humanitarian aid. We 
would not be opposed to the opening of Tuzla airport either. Of 
course, we would demand the opening of Banja Luka and other 
airports as well as various other venues of communication, and 
therefore, unhindered traffic. However, we suspect, that is to 
say, we have fairly reliable information on plans to abuse Tuzla 
airport in the same way Sarajevo airport has been abused, by 
using the lines and routes for humanitarian aid distribution to 
arm the Muslims. This is also the objective for Tuzla airport. 
If we can protect our people from the plan that some Western 
forces have concocted and prevent the armament of the Muslims, 
we will have nothing against the opening of Tuzla airport. If 
the superpowers nevertheless wish to open Tuzla airport we will 
insist on certain preconditions to eliminate this danger. They 
can definitely open Tuzla airport by force, which would be 
nothing unusual at this moment, as neither law nor justice are 
being observed. However, the Serbs will oppose by all means, 
the opening of Tuzla airport without our side's consent. [end

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 28 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces have 
driven some six tanks out of the exclusion zone around Sarajevo 
in violation of the NATO ban on heavy weapons, a UN spokesman 
said here Monday [28 February]. 
  "Several tanks were withdrawn out of the northern part of 
the 
(NATO-declared) 20 kilometres (12-mile) exclusion zone," UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Canadian Lieutenant-Colonel Bill 
Aikman told reporters. 
  He said the tanks were spotted moving at about the 10 
kilometres (six-mile) portion of the zone by UN military 
observers. 
  The observers "did not have the capability to stop the 
tanks," Aikman said. 
  But he said the movement of the 6 or 7 tanks was a clear 
violation of the NATO ultimatum that expired a week ago for all 
heavy artillery to be withdrawn from Sarajevo, where Serbs 
besiege a mainly Moslem population. 
  As of the expiration date, all heavy guns, including tanks, 
were to be withdrawn or placed under UNPROFOR control. If not, 
NATO warplanes were to strike the weapons. 
  Aikman said the Serb tanks "appear to have been hidden 
somewhere and then moved out." 
  They went through a point north of Vogosca, in hills north 
of 
Sarajevo. 
  Aikman said UNPROFOR would be "increasing patrols in the 
area 
to determine if there are any more" heavy weapons there. 
  UNPROFOR has admitted the Serbs have not handed over all 
their weapons and the Bosnian Government charges that the Serbs 
have kept up to 70 percent of the weapons they had targeted on 
Sarajevo in the exclusion zone.

  [Text] Zvornik, Feb 28 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb Chief of 
Staff General Manojlo Milovanovic says that the Serb side 
resents the unilateral and rash decisions of the U.N. 
peacekeepers' commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Michael 
Rose, to change the regimen of the movement of humanitarian 
convoys and reopen a bridge in Sarajevo. 
  Commenting on Gen. Rose's decision that humanitarian convoys 
as of Monday move through that war-shattered former Yugoslav 
republic with armed escort and without the prior consent of the 
warring parties, Gen. Milovanovic said that nothing had changed 
as far as the Serbs are concerned and that aid and other convoys 
would in the future continue to need Serb consent to pass 
through Bosnian Serb territory. "Otherwise, we shall prevent 
their movement, at arms if necessary," Milovanovic told TANJUG 
late on Sunday. 
  Bosnian Serbs will not permit humanitarian convoys to move 
through their territory without their permission and control, 
because the Bosnian Serb army had on several occasions found the 
U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to be smuggling arms and 
ammunition for the Moslems. 
  Milovanovic said also that, if necessary, the Serb side 
would 
use force to prevent the reopening of Sarajevo's bridge, 
announced for noon on Monday. He explained that the bridge 
could be reopened only in consultations between the Serbs and 
Moslems with the mediation of U.N. special envoy to former 
Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi. 
  Milovanovic said that all convoys, especially aid convoys, 
had always been safe only in Serb territory. 
  By contrast, those travelling through Moslem and Croat 
territories have frequently been attacked, with dozens of relief 
aid workers killed and wounded. 
  Incidents of this kind have never been recorded in Serb 
territory. 
  However, the announced change in the regimen of the movement 
of humanitarian convoys puts an equation mark between the Serbs 
and the other two warring nations. 
  The attitude of the Moslem and Croat sides to humanitarian 
convoys is evident from countless incidents, such as the downing 
of an Italian transporter over Jablanica, the murder of a Danish 
driver at Travnik, the murder of a British aid worker and the 
wounding of two others at Zenica, etc. 
  More recently, an UNPROFOR inquiry has showed that Moslem 
forces wounded five Swedish peacekeepers near Kakanj on Tuesday, 
an incident that was originally blamed on the Serbs, in the 
absence of all proof, with the former UNPROFOR Chief of Staff in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina General Angus Ramsay going so far as to call 
for NATO air strikes against the Serbs. 
  A day later, British U.N. troops said they had bombed out 
two 
Croat bunkers at Gornji Vakuf, which had been used to attack two 
U.N. aid convoys.

  The commander of UN forces in Bosnia said he had "an

  [Text] The situation in the free territories of Tesanj, 
Maglaj, Doboj, and Teslic is extremely serious. In fact, it is 
dramatic. Decisive battles are being waged. The enemy is 
pounding civilians and residential areas with unprecedented 
savagery. The 133-km long defense line of the Seven South 
Operative Group is in flames. The Serb aggressor has engaged 
almost 50 percent of their military might in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
including heavy artillery withdrawn from the Sarajevo 
battlefield. This all-out attack, which the army of occupation 
calls Borders '94, is coordinated personally by war criminals 
generals Mladic and Talic. The aim is to establish the southern 
border of the phantom Serb state in the area of the Vranduk 
tunnel. The free territories of Tesanj, Maglaj, Doboj, and 
Teslic are -- believe it or not -- being hit by more than 200 
heavy shells every hour. These barbaric attacks aiming at 
systematic destruction of civilians and their homes have outdone 
everything seen so far on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  As I am reporting, tank and howitzer shells are raining down 
onto the town of Tesanj, as was the case throughout last night. 
However, the situation is the most serious in Maglaj where most 
civilians are dying. Specifically, the army of occupation is 
doing its best to capture Maglaj and drive out its remaining 
surviving residents. We are reminding the international 
community once again, for the umpteenth time, that Maglaj and 
Tesanj have been encircled by the aggressor and completely 
sealed off for nine months. This is the only area in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina where the aggressor is stopping all convoys 
with food and other goods for civilians. 
  However, our soldiers have not given in. In hand to hand 
fighting, the joint units of the Seven South Operative Group and 
the 2d Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army have halted the 
aggressor, and everyone is determined to die rather than allow 
the army of occupation to enter Tesanj and Maglaj. All defense 
lines are unchanged, and the aggressor is suffering heavy, truly 
heavy, losses in manpower. Our soldiers keep on fighting. 
Hajrudin Rezovic reported from the information center of the 
Seven South Operative Group.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Feb 26 (AFP) -- Residents of the 
besieged Moslem-held town of Maglaj pleaded Saturday for UN 
forces to protect the 35,000 civilians there, in reports 
received from ham radio operators inside the town. 
  The operators, speaking on Radio Sarajevo, said "defense 
lines are burning. It's the the final hell." They said two 
ground-to-ground missiles had hit Maglaj Saturday. Serbs and 
Croats are attacking the northern Bosnia town. 
  The appeals of the isolated Moslem pocket against an 
offensive by better-armed Serbs recalled those of ham radio 
operators last year from the eastern pockets of Gorazde and 
Srebrenica. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, 10 mortar rounds hit the southern city of Mostar 
Saturday but UN officials said the Moslem-Croat ceasefire was 
generally holding. Ham radio operators speaking on Radio 
Sarajevo said Croats were also firing anti-aircraft weapons. 
The operators said UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi would be 
visiting Mostar over the next few days. 
  Akashi's office in Sarajevo said the UN envoy was planning 
to 
visit the war-ravaged southern city of Mostar on Monday, but 
that the trip had not received final confirmation. [passage 
omitted] 
  The radio Saturday reported tank and mortar fire on the 
northern and southern parts of the city. 
  UN humanitarian aid to Maglaj has been restricted by the 
fighting. UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman 
Kris Janowski said this week that Maglaj was "the most desperate 
place in Bosnia food-wise and in every other way." [passage 
omitted] 
  The ham radio operators said Serb helicopters were flying 
over the town in defiance of the NATO-enforced no-fly zone over 
Bosnia. They said no NATO planes were in the skies. 
  A UN spokesman meanwhile reported heavy shelling Monday in 
the northern Bosnian town of Maglaj, in the first western 
confirmation of intense fighting there. 
  UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Canadian 
Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman said he could not provide more 
details since the closest UN observers were three kilometres 
(two miles) from the town. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 27 (AFP) -- UN humanitarian convoys 
will move through central Bosnia as of Monday [28 February] 
without detours, without negotiating passage in advance and 
routinely with armored escort, a UN spokesman said here Sunday. 
  UN Bosnian commander General Michael Rose's approach is "to 
give notice and then run convoys," UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Kris Janowski said. 
  He said convoys in the past had negotiated their passage 
with 
the warring parties who often blocked humanitarian aid at their 
checkpoints. The convoys did not always have armored escorts. 
But now the convoys would have an armored UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) escort which would give notice of their passage but 
not negotiate in advance about whether they could move through 
certain territory. 
  Janowski said this did not mean the UNPROFOR would force its 
way although UNPROFOR policy is to return fire if fired upon. 
  Convoys have also been blocked, however, by civilian 
demonstrations, often by women. Janowski stressed that the 
armored escort would not be forcing its way through such 
demonstrations. 
  He said that on Monday a Danish convoy would be traveling 
from Metkovic, in Croatia on the Adriatic Coast, to Sarajevo 
directly through Mostar instead of detouring through Gornji 
Vakuf. 
  The 300,000 residents of Sarajevo are cut of by a Serb siege 
and completely dependent on humanitarian aid to survive. The 
same is true for Moslems in Tuzla and other cities. The detour 
has been necessary due to Moslem-Croat fighting over the past 10 
months, in Mostar in the south but also in the approach through 
central Bosnia to Sarajevo. Moslems and Croats began a 
ceasefire Friday that appeared to be holding despite some 
violations. 
  Janowski said a convoy would be leaving Zenica in central 
Bosnia on Wednesday for Maglaj in the north. Maglaj has not 
received a convoy since October as the Moslems there are under 
attack from Serb and Croat forces. People there are said to be 
on the verge of starvation. 
  "This will be a test of the ceasefire to allow the free 
passage of convoys," Janowski said about getting through to 
Maglaj.

Security Council. The letter says: 
  A ferocious offensive on Maglaj has been going on for days 
now. The situation is deteriorating by the hour due to the 
employment of the heavy artillery the Serb aggressor withdrew 
from around Sarajevo. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has done and 
is doing everything it possibly can to rescue the town and its 
residents. Our defenses are flagging due to the enemy's 
technical superiority. Thousands of civilians -- mostly women 
and children -- are facing a fresh massacre. We are demanding 
urgent action on the part of the United Nations to forestall 
genocide, President Izetbegovic's letter says.

  [Text] Following the announcement of the arrival in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina of a new contingent of Russian troops, Alija 
Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina, today sent a 
letter to Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special 
envoy. The letter reads: 
  Esteemed Mr. Akashi, the behavior of Russian soldiers on 
their arrival in Sarajevo caused dissatisfaction among the 
citizens, and -- I believe -- damaged the reputation of the UN 
mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On their arrival they 
demonstrated support for the aggressor and behaved in a way 
which reminded us of some earlier ugly periods. Our people took 
all this as a provocation which could have turned into an 
incident. 
  Bearing this in mind, it is my duty to inform you that we do 
not agree to the arrival of more Russian troops in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We believe that decisions to this effect 
should be postponed. We ask you to inform the competent UN 
officials about our position on this issue, Alija Izetbegovic 
says in his letter.

President Yasir 'Arafat in connection with the massacre of 
Palestinians in the town of Hebron. 
  The letter reads: I am shocked by the news of the horrific 
massacre of Palestinians in Hebron. The seriousness of the 
incident is aggravated by the fact that it took place during the 
holy month of Ramadan, in God's shrine, during the holy act of 
morning prayer. The latest crime in Hebron, like the recent 
massacre at the market in Sarajevo, is the kind of crime that 
leaves one speechless. We consider the innocent victims at the 
mosque in Hebron to be our own. We pray God to bestow 
everlasting blessings upon the dead and give patience to their 
families, the letter says.

  [Text] Novi Sad, Feb 26 (TANJUG) -- Commander of the 
Bosnian Serb Army General Staff, Gen. Ratko Mladic, has said one 
should not worry over the Serb defence positions around Sarajevo 
after the withdrawal of heavy weapons, because the U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was really making an effort to 
maintain ceasefire. 
  If, however, the Moslems launch an offensive (in the 
Sarajevo 
area) the (Bosnian) Serbs will fiercely respond with all 
available means, Gen. Mladic warned in an interview to the Novi 
Sad daily DNEVNIK on Saturday. 
  I would not recommend to Moslems to take up arms. It is 
better (for them) to try to achieve their goals peacefully -- 
through negotiations, in which they can achieve much, because 
they can lose everything by opting for war, he said. 
  In connection with the insistence by some western countries, 
especially france to threaten the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes 
unless they allow the opening of the airfield in Tuzla, Gen. 
Mladic said he was confident that the airfield in that Moslem 
enclave would be least used for humanitarian aid supply. 
  We have reliable information that weapons and ammunition, as 
well as Mujaheddin from Islamic countries would be brought in by 
planes, he said. 
  Stressing that the Serb side will discuss with UNPROFOR the 
possibilities for the opening of the airfield, and that it is 
ready to negotiate this directly with the Moslems, Gen. Mladic 
warned that it should, nevertheless, be clear to everybody that 
Bosnian Serbs would not allow the case of the Sarajevo airport 
to be repeated. 
  "We held the Sarajevo airport, and then turned it over to 
UNPROFOR, and the Moslems dug a tunnel under the airport and use 
it unhindered (for military purposes), despite our warnings to 
the peace-keeping command and U.N. Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali," said Gen. Mladic. 
  In connection with the talks on forming a common Bosnian 
Moslem- Croat state, Gen. Mladic said it was possible that a 
Moslem-Croat coalition backed primarily by Croatia, as well as 
many other countries, again take up arms and come against the 
Serbs. 
  As long as the international factors do not want peace in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina, there will be no peace, Gen. Mladic 
concluded.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Feb 27 (AFP) -- A confederation 
between Bosnian Croats and Moslems could help resolve internal 
problems for both sides and give them a chance to concentrate on 
a common enemy -- the Serbs, officials here said. 
  Such an accord would give the mainly Moslem Bosnian 
government "the chance to finally deal with only one enemy, the 
Serbs," Vice President Ejup Ganic told reporters. 
  Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic was in Washington 
Sunday for the second day of talks with Croatian Foreign 
Minister Mate Granic on the creation of a Moslem-Croat 
federation in Croatia's war-torn neighbor, Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
[passage omitted] 
  Ganic said Croatia, however, had yet to win the withdrawal 
of 
Serb troops from both Bosnia and Serbia, which have occupied a 
third of its country since the war there ended shortly before 
the Bosnian conflict began. 
  Pushing the Bosnian Croats to reach an agreement with the 
Moslems would give Croatia "a chance to deal with the Krajina 
(Serb-occupied Croatia) without any distractions," Ganic said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Ganic said: ``When the Croats and Moslems have a federal 
state with part occupied by the Serbs, then we can deal with 
that. But the federal state comes first. 
  "Then as one country we will deal with the Serbs, one on 
one." 
  He said that since there had been greater U.S. involvement 
in 
Bosnia on the Moslems side, the Serbs had turned to Moscow. The 
Serbs, Ganic said, "are reveling in everything Russian. They 
can have the Russians." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Excerpt" from an interview with Nikola Koljevic, vice </F>
president of the Srpska republic, by an unidentified 
correspondent on 26 February; from the "Sa Lica Mesta" program 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Koljevic] In short, we believe that the Russian 
initiative is very good, that superpowers and big nations should 
participate, and that their authority -- political and any other 
-- will grow further. Therefore, in principle the Russian plan 
involves greater authority and thus also a quicker solution. We 
shall see who is pleased with this initiative and who is not. 
For the time being the replies from the West have been a bit 
reserved and ambiguous. However, we support such an initiative 
in any case. Regarding the U.S. plan, if we demand 
self-determination for ourselves and know that the Serbian side 
would not agree to any sort of political dependence or 
subordination to other sides, we have no democratic right, and 
we must allow the negotiations between the Muslims and the 
Croats, especially in the political sphere, as long as they are 
not to our detriment. These talks have to do with an internal 
matter, a question of their domestic relations, so to speak; 
naturally, this is all based on the fundamental assumption that 
this will not be a military alliance, as it was at the beginning 
of the war, but a political integration that suits them. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Given the circumstances, how 
should one understand the position of the Serbs and define the 
Serbian interest? 
  [Koljevic] Well, I believe that this was already defined a 
few days ago -- in THE WASHINGTON POST yesterday or the day 
before -- namely, that the Serbs will be absolutely free to 
choose their form of constitution, that they will be able to set 
themselves up independently in the Srpska republic or unify with 
Serbia, which is actually the wish of the people and in our 
natural historic interest. This is already being mentioned 
publicly as a viable option in the United States if this thing 
between the Muslims and the Croats proves to be viable.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Rose, British commander of the UN </F>
Blue Helmets in Bosnia, by Renaud Girard in Sarajevo; date not 
given: "New Tensions on all Fronts in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- 
General Rose: `No NATO Bomb Will Be Dropped Without My Order'"] 
  [Text] Born in 1940 in Quetta, in the region of 
British India which was to become Pakistan, General Michael Rose 
is considered as one to Her Majesty's most brilliant soldiers. A 
paratrooper, he is also an Oxford graduate. In 1982, during the 
Falkland war, he was in command of the 22d SAS Regiment (Special 
Air Service, the British Army's elite commando corps). After 
becoming army chief of staff, Lieutenant-General Rose took 
command on 5 January of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
<H5>  New Air Strike Doctrine </H5>
  In an interview with LE FIGARO, he explains the new doctrine 
on the use of air power as part of a UN peacekeeping operation. 
Indeed, this is the first time UN ground soldiers on a 
peacekeeping mission are given air support -- here from NATO 
aircraft. 
  [Girard] Before the weekend there still were a few Serbian 
gun batteries -- for instance at Osijek -- which were not under 
UNPROFOR control, despite NATO's ultimatum. How do you explain 
this? What are you going to do about it? 
  [Rose] The UNPROFOR has not yet succeeded in getting all 
heavy weapons on all sites under control. First of all because 
of the weather. Collecting all weapons was very difficult. 
Second, the Serbs did not manage to carry out such a task as 
efficiently as they thought they would: Their army is rather 
poorly structured, it is only a loose collection of militias. 
Third, they consider they never agreed to disarm, only to place 
their weapons under UN control. There has been some confusion 
at lower echelons. 
  [Girard] And yet NATO's ultimatum was very clear... 
  [Rose] Indeed, and we could have taken a much tougher stand. 
We chose to be understanding to avoid negative repercussions on 
our action as a whole. The goodwill of the Bosnian Serbs is 
real, as we can see from our daily meetings with (their 
"President") Radovan Karadzic. Serbian officials say: "We are 
having difficulties, but we want to disarm and we are doing it. 
Stop hassling us!" Basically, Serbian militia men are totally 
confused, and this is the reason why we do not push as hard as 
we could. However, I can certify that they cannot resume 
artillery fire without first having to fight us. We removed 
essential parts from their weapons, which means that, 
technically, these guns are under our control, even if their 
being scattered all over the place is an inconvenience. And the 
situation is getting better every day. 
  [Girard] The Bosnian presidency stated that at least five 
Serbian batteries remained out of UN control... 
  [Rose] We act every time reconnaissance aircraft identify 
new heavy weapons. Often, the Serbs will have forgotten they 
had placed guns here or there. These are abandoned guns which 
they had not used in a long time. Nevertheless, I will not let 
myself be diverted from my main goal: the peace process. This 
is more than a mere cease-fire. We want to turn Sarajevo into a 
European city again, an open city with a normal life. LE FIGARO 
mentioned the risk of the siege becoming institutionalized, as 
in Nicosia. I repeat, we do not want that. We have already 
achieved a lot. 
<H5>  `Totally in Phase With NATO' </H5>
  [Girard] There are still incidents, light weapon fire. Are 
you not afraid of the Serbs slowly chipping away at the 
cease-fire? 
  [Rose] This is a real danger. The Serbs charged the 
Bosnians with trying to advance their front-line positions at 
four different places. If this is true, it is unacceptable. I 
am going to visit those places: If trenches have indeed been 
moved, I will demand that the Bosnian Army return to the 
positions it held when the cease-fire took effect. 
  [Girard] Everyone could see over the last three weeks that 
there was a substantial discrepancy between NATO's discourse, 
which has been rather "hawkish," and that of the United Nations, 
more on the "dovey" side. How do you overcome the contradiction? 
  [Rose] I can only comment from a tactical viewpoint, my own. 
(...) But I can tell you that since 9 February, the day when I 
laid the foundation of a peace agreement with the Serbs and the 
Muslims, I have been totally in phase with NATO. You may have 
noted that some terms of the Brussels' communique (NATO's 
ultimatum issued on the night of 9 February) seem to have been 
directly taken from the agreement signed by the Serbs and the 
Bosnians. The ultimatum reinforced our peace plan. 
  [Girard] Were you absolutely certain that NATO Southern Area 
Commander Admiral Boorda would only send out his planes on your 
request? 
  [Rose] Absolutely. There must be no doubt about it: NATO 
is here only as a support force. And it is a first: A regional 
defense organization coming to support a UN peacekeeping force. 
I am positive: Not a single NATO bomb will be dropped without 
my order. With the exception of a plane acting in self-defense, 
of course. 
  [Girard] Was your tactical approach -- enforcing the cease- 
fire and sending Blue Helmets to guard Serb batteries -- not 
inconsistent with a strategic decision to perform even a 
symbolic strike in order to convince the Serbs of Western 
determination? 
  [Girard] I am very clear on the matter. Our first priority 
is to make sure humanitarian aid comes through. This is a 
matter of survival for 2,700,000 people in Bosnia. Our second 
priority is to facilitate the creation of safe havens, one of 
them being Sarajevo. We will be able to carry out such missions 
as long as we remain noncombatants. As soon as we become 
combatants -- see what happened in Somalia -- we become helpless. 
<H5>  `Our Planes Would Blow It to Smithereens' </H5>
  There is one question left: How do we reconcile air strikes 
and continued noncombatant status? Simple: The use of air 
power must remain proportional and strictly connected to this or 
that violation of the ultimatum. It must be a way to strike 
back, not to change the military balance or the political 
landscape. I developed a number of principles: 
  -- Any strike must be directed at the guilty party. 
  -- It must be proportionate: You are not going to destroy a 
whole army because someone fired at you once. 
  -- It is necessary to determine in the field whether the 
target is a legitimate one. 
  [Girard] Meaning... ? 
  [Rose] Let us take an example. Very recently, a U.S. plane 
told us about hostile fire, speculating that it might have been 
a 20-mm three-tube cannon (a weapon banned by the ultimatum). 
We sent a military monitor to check it out and it turned out 
that it had been only a young man wasting his 12.7-mm machine 
gun's ammunition for the hell of it. This cretin was not worth 
an air strike. However, should an artillery regiment -- on 
whatever side -- attempt to reassemble and to fire on or from 
Sarajevo, then our planes would blow it to smithereens. 
  [Girard] Then weapons will now surely remain silent in 
Sarajevo? 
  [Rose] Both armies have now gotten as far as was possible 
for them. Without their artillery, the Serbs cannot conquer any 
more land, supposing they want to. (...) The Bosnians know 
that they cannot substantially alter the military situation with 
ground soldiers only. They have been paying attention to 
Western pressure. In Sarajevo, we have reached a kind of climax 
as far as military operations are concerned, which will make it 
possible for the peace plan to be implemented.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 17 (TANJUG) -- Paul Beaver, a 
prominent British military expert said Thursday that Bosnian 
Serbs possessed a series of anti-aircraft systems to respond to 
NATO air strikes in case they are launched against the Serbs' 
positions around Sarajevo. 
  The analyst of the British Jane's defence military magazine 
in an interview to the VOA monitored in Belgrade, said that the 
Bosnian Serbs not only possessed missiles with a 40-km range and 
a number of anti-aircraft and shoulder rocket launchers, but 
also a completely new Russian system called SA-16. NATO says 
the system is difficult to counter. 
  Beaver said Bosnian Serbs possessed a large number of 
anti-aircraft cannon and added that most of the aircraft in the 
Gulf war as well as in the Falklands war 12 years ago, were 
known to be shot down by the infantry fire from the ground. 
  The analyst thus warned that the West should not be led into 
believing that the war planes would be able to launch attacks on 
the Sarajevo surroundings without being exposed to danger. 
  He said that on top of that NATO did not have the best 
trained pilots in the world. Last Wednesday NATO threatened the 
Bosnian Serbs and Moslems they would be bombed unless they 
withdrew their heavy artillery in and around Sarajevo or place 
it under U.N. control. 
  Although the NATO ultimatum concerns all three sides to the 
Bosnian conflict, many Western politicians and media regard the 
ultimatum as directed to the Bosnian Serbs alone.

the demarcation line in Mostar town center at around 1100 today. 
They used infantry weapons and also fired 27 bazooka and 
recoilless gun shells. [passage omitted] 
  Since the cease-fire came into force, the Muslims have 
attempted more infantry breakthroughs than in the 20 days 
preceding the agreement, Bosnian Croat Defense Council Spokesman 
Veso Vegar said.

  [Text] Medjugorje, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Feb 27 (AFP) -- 
Shelling on the Moslem-held part of Mostar, in southern Bosnia, 
has broken a truce agreed between Bosnian army and Croat 
officials for two days running, a UN spokesman said here Sunday. 
  Eleven shells fell on the eastern part of the city late 
Saturday and two explosions were heard early Sunday in the same 
area, Colonel Antonio Castro of the UN Protection Force's 
(UNPROFOR) Spanish battalion said. 
  "It's the first time the ceasefire has really been 
violated," 
the spokesman said. The truce went into effect on Friday [25 
February] at 1200 GMT. 
  Castro said an investigation would have to be held to 
determine who is responsible for the shelling. The Spanish 
battalion has its headquarters in Medjugorje, around 20 
kilometres (12 miles) from Mostar. 
  The city is divided between the Croat troops who hold the 
western part and have besieged for the past six month the 
Moslem-held eastern part where some 50,000 people are trapped. 
  During the two weeks preceeding the ceasefire agreement, an 
average of the 10 shells fell daily on the eastern part.

Jean Cot, UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] commander for the area 
of the former Yugoslavia, and General Michael Rose, UN peace 
force commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina, following cease-fire 
violations by the Bosnia-Herzegovina army. In his letter General 
Roso states that Muslim forces launched a heavy attack today on 
the free territory of Zepce, using mortars and howitzers. One 
HVO soldier was killed and three wounded in these attacks. 
  In his letter General Roso says that Muslim forces organized 
and staged an HVO attack on their positions on the eastern side 
of Mostar. They had in advance positioned TV cameramen who were 
supposed to film this artillery action, thus gaining a certain 
political as well as military advantage. General Roso demands 
that UNPROFOR take measures on the ground in order to thwart 
similar action.

  [Text] All the fronts in the operative zone of the 
Operational Group Doboj are being exposed to a fierce Muslim 
offensive, in which the forces of the 2d and 3d Corps of the 
Muslim army are involved. The heaviest attacks against the army 
of the Srpska republic are under way on the fronts very close to 
Doboj, so the general alarm is in force in the town. 
  In an offensive that has apparently been prepared in detail, 
the Muslims are attempting to break through from several 
directions: from Zenica toward Zavidovici and Maglaj, from 
(Vracanica) toward Doboj, and from Tesanj and the Usora River 
valley toward Teslic and Doboj. 
  At the same time, and despite the signed cease-fire, the 
Muslim fanatics are attacking Croatian forces in Zepce. The 
Muslims are obviously trying to expand their territories by 
force before the peace talks. General Ratko Mladic and General 
Momir Talic are directing the defense operations of the Srpska 
republic army in the region.

  [Text] Zvornik, February 26 (TANJUG) -- Fighting continued 
on Saturday between Bosnian Croats and Moslems despite the 
agreed ceasefire which became effective at noon on Friday, 
Bosnian Serb military sources said. 
  In the area of Mostar in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
former allies are engaged in artillery duels while Moslem 
artillery units are firing at Croats in central 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in the region of Novi Travnik, Kiseljak and 
Fojnica. 
  Croats are shelling Moslems in the valley of the Lasva, and 
the shelling is particularly heavy near Gornji Vakuf and 
Bugojno, also in central Bosnia. 
  Regular troops from the Republic of Croatia are also still 
fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina, despite U.N. Security Council 
decisions that they must withdraw. 
  The Croatian Army launched a strong artillery attack from 
Croatian territory against Serb areas in Posavina, a region in 
northern Bosnia along the border with Croatia. The attack 
directly threatened the Bijeljina-Banja Luka road which links 
eastern and western parts of the Bosnian Serb republic. 
  Bosnian Serb military circles interpreted this attack as 
resulting from the latest Croat-Moslem ceasefire agreement and 
underscored that Bosnian Serb forces did not return fire after 
Croat artillery launched attacks from the left bank of the Sava. 
  Provocative and offensive actions by Moslem units against 
the 
Serb side also continued in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and were 
even stepped up in some areas, TANJUG learned from Bosnian Serb 
military circles. 
  The heaviest Moslem mortar and artillery attacks took place 
in eastern Bosnia from the regions of Kalesija and Olovo, where 
the Moslem infantry was also active. 
  Meanwhile, Moslem units are regrouping and moving their 
weapons on the Kladanj-Zivinica direction. 
  In northwestern Bosnia, Moslem artillery-infantry attacks on 
Serb territory, which began several days ago, continued from the 
region of Bihac.

  [Text] Belgrade, 26 Feb (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic [RS], this evening warned the 
UN Secretary General's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, that 
Muslim forces are abusing the Sarajevo cease-fire in order to 
gain a military advantage. 
  In a letter to Akashi, a copy of which has been sent to 
TANJUG, Karadzic points out that since the first day of the 
cease-fire Muslim forces have been moving their trench lines 
towards Serb positions. 
  "These engineering works have been going on constantly,

up to today," Karadzic alleges, assessing that this is "an 
attempt to improve their military position under cover of the 
cease-fire." 
  The RS president points out that these Muslim cease-fire 
violations are being carried out in many places -- in Mojmilo 
(three or four places), in the Jewish cemetery, in the 
Dobrinja-Vojkovici area (two places), Rajlovac (three places), 
on Zuc (two places), in Brijesce and in the Butmir-Ilidza area. 
  "We strongly protest against these Muslim military 
activities, which are a clear and flagrant violation of the 
Serb-Muslim agreement reached on 9 February," Karadzic writes, 
assessing that "this cease-fire which was realized with such 
difficulty is now under serious threat." 
  "Furthermore, the whole peace process is now in danger. 
Unless the newly dug Muslim trenches are abandoned and 
destroyed, the already begun measures to build confidence will 
suffer huge damage," Karadzic assesses, adding that "if 
something is not done quickly," the Serb side will not be able 
to continue its cooperation in the efforts to achieve peace in 
the Sarajevo region.

<F P=106> [Report by Jozo Curic] </F>
  [Text] Washington--The Croatian-U.S. meeting ended late 
this afternoon, Central European time. Foreign Minister Mate 
Granic, President Zubak [of the presidential council of 
Herceg-Bosna], and Minister Akmadzic talked to Clinton's special 
envoy Redman, Warren Christopher's assistant Oxman, and 
Ambassadors Galbraith and Jakovich. Then the Bosnian side met 
the Americans. They talked about the models of organizing a new 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in future confederal links between Croatia 
and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Following consultations with President Tudjman, the Croatian 
side presented its hosts with new proposals. As we have learned 
from sources close to the State Department, at the meeting the 
Croatian representatives insisted on full protection for the 
rights of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This, the 
Croatians believe, is the most essential element of the 
agreement. 
  Two models are being studied behind closed doors in the 
State 
Department. According to one, the two republics would be linked 
up in a federal state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, while the other 
envisages the creation of cantons some of which would be 
predominantly Croat while the others would be predominantly 
Bosnian. Every canton would have its inherent [izvorni] 
sovereignty and authority. This authority would then be vested 
in the federal state of Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
  Observers stress that these cantons would be organized in 
two 
unions, a union of Croat cantons and a union of Bosnian cantons. 
There are reports that Croat cantons might include 
municipalities with a majority Muslim population while Muslim 
cantons might include municipalities with a majority Croat 
population. Mechanisms of mutual protection for members of the 
Croat and the Muslim people in these municipalities, each of 
which would be linked to its own union of cantons, were also 
discussed. According to some reports, there is a possibility of 
dividing powers between federal bodies -- that is, president, 
bicameral parliament, government, and constitutional court -- 
and intercantonal bodies. 
  Minister Granic told reporters outside the State Department 
that the talks will continue and that further details will be 
known late this evening, Central European time, or even later. 
The two delegations and their hosts agreed that no details 
about the talks should be disclosed. Asked about the atmosphere 
at the meeting and whether any side had ruled out the 
possibility of reaching agreement, Granic told Croatian 
television: There is a working atmosphere at the meeting. No 
one has ruled out agreement although there still remain open 
issues. 
  Observers in Washington have learned that the confederal 
model between Croatia and a new Bosnia-Herzegovina was discussed 
for the first time today. For the time being any details are 
regarded as secret. The United States intends to draw up its 
own text on the basis of the Croatian and Muslim proposal. Also 
mentioned were a monetary and customs union and an economic and 
defense agreement between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Central Bosnia was also discussed as well as protective 
mechanisms for the Croats there. There are also a number of 
options and models of involving the Serbs. 
  As we file this report intensive consultations are still in 
progress. The hosts are sticking to the principle of talking 
separately to the Croatian and Bosnian representatives.

<F P=106> [Article by D. Vujicic: "God -- The Only Controller"] </F>
  [Text] One of the dailies published the news that "a close 
encounter between General Ratko Mladic, commander of the Srpska 
republic army, who was flying in his helicopter and two U.S. 
F-16 fighters has recently taken place in the skies above the 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina." According to this story, the U.S. 
fighters descended to the height at which general's helicopter 
was flying, waved to him with their wings and flew their own way. 
  The air force of the Srpska republic army is not familiar 
with this event, however, in Bosnia -- a land of miracles, 
anything is possible. 
  They say that on a clear night one can count more aircraft 
and helicopters in the sky above the former Bosnia-Herzegovina 
than there are stars. There is noone who has not been flying -- 
the command of Srpska republic army air force says -- especially 
since "the no-fly" directive. 
  Since NATO aircraft began patrolling over this republic, the 
North Atlantic air force has carried out more than 12,000 
flights above Bosnia, of which more than 7,000 were combat 
flights. As our source explains, NATO classifies as noncombat 
flights those that carry humanitarian aid and transport 
organization officials. The UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], 
too, have carried out thousands of flights by airplanes and 
helicopters, and the air force of the Republic of Croatia does 
not pay much attention to the no-fly directive either. 
  The Croats have actually never stopped flying over the 
former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and in the latest Croatian Army and Croatian 
Defense Council operations in central Bosnia they have been 
using helicopters daily. 
  According to foreign sources, the Muslim army has 14 Hind 
helicopters and four ultralight airplanes, which are also 
carrying our combat flights. 
  Since they have been on this mission, NATO aircraft have not 
downed a single aircraft of either side. Our sources claim that 
the opportunity to do this presents itself some 10 to 20 
occasions daily, which is how many Muslim and Croatian flights 
Serbian radars register over Bosnia on average. To illustrate 
this information, our source says that, for example, Serbian 
radars the day before yesterday registered 117 flights over this 
republic, 10 of which were carried out by the Croats and Muslims. 
  God alone controls and coordinates these flights above 
Bosnia. NATO plans its routes and controls them from Vicenza 
[Italy] by means of AWACS aircraft in the Adriatic Sea. The 
Croats do this via Zagreb, and the Muslims most probably from 
Zenica, even though they surrendered control of the skies to the 
Croats in May 1992. UNPROFOR, although it cooperates with NATO, 
also uses its own systems for navigation of aircraft, most 
probably from Sarajevo. Must one should point out that there is 
no coordination between them. 
  Finally, our source, who is otherwise a senior military 
expert in the Serbian Republic Army, says that it is a real 
miracle that there have been no crashes and major tragedies 
above Bosnia so far. He warns that anything is possible in the 
skies over Bosnia-Herzegovina, bearing in mind the absence of 
flight controllers. Such aa situation could be used against the 
Serbian side, which really flies only when it has to, that is, 
when wounded need to be transported to hospitals. 
<H5>  [Box p 5] </H5>
<H5>  Blind Flights </H5>
  What distinguishes the flights of the Croats, the Muslims, 
and the Serbs over the former Bosnia-Herzegovina from NATO and 
UNPROFOR flights is that "home boys" try to avoid using radio 
during the flight in order to remain unnoticed. They are, 
therefore, flying blind as the local pilots know the terrain 
like their backyard. 
  According to military circles, NATO fighters have more or 
less given up chasing these aircraft as pilots manage to mislead 
them and land on time. On the other hand, there have been cases 
of "remote control aircraft" being sent over mountain peaks to 
taunt U.S. radars and aircraft.

  [Excerpt] President Clinton expects success in the talks 
between the delegations of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. Here 
is a report from Washington: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] It cannot exactly be said that 
the talks between the delegations of Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which began at the State Department 
yesterday, have achieved any particular progress. However, the 
fact that the timing of the talks, set by the Americans, has 
been observed promises that a positive conclusion of the 
Washington talks on internal organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
can be expected as early as tomorrow afternoon. 
  This morning the formulation of the republic's name was on 
the agenda, a name which should -- mapart from the geographic 
and historical name of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- also contain a 
constitutional solution, such as federation, confederation, 
union, and so forth. None of the solutions has been adopted so 
far. 
  Bosnian territories currently under the control of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina army, and the territories under HVO [Croat 
Defense Council] control, which -- we must not forget -- are 
also Bosnian territories, should during the negotiations be 
defined as parts of the overall territory which is currently not 
under occupation, populated by citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Bosniaks, Croats, Serbs, and others, with the right to have the 
occupied territories reintegrated into the state of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina when this is rendered possible. 
  Let me also emphasize that the future state, according to 
this agreement, looks increasingly similar to the original 
Vance-Owen plan. According to the plan Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
divided into 17 cantons. The unified Bosnian [word indistinct] 
is only the western and central territory; that is, the Bosnian 
territories populated by the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Bosniaks, Croats, and others. It would be the successor of the 
state sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina and would remain a 
recognized member of the United Nations. 
  The Americans particularly insist that in this phase the 
reintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be approached by 
first halting the Bosnian-Croat hostilities, then by restoring 
their alliance, and by articulating the territorial interests of 
the Bosnian people, who would thus preserve their own access to 
the sea, which they have had throughout their history, but which 
has been territorially reduced in repeated enemy agression.

  [Text] Warsaw, 25 Feb--Deputy Prime Minister Aleksander 
Luczak received today Pang Yong-toc, ambassador of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Views were exchanged on 
possibilities for intensifying contacts between both countries, 
the government press office reports. 
  The ambassador emphasized that his country pursued its own 
political path, but wanted to maintain good relations with all 
states that respected this choice. He underscored that he hoped 
new cooperation with Poland in the scientific and technological 
field is established soon. He pointed out that an enlivening of 
contacts between health services of both countries would be 
desirable, as well as the signing of an agreement on mutual 
recognition of medical degrees. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Luczak expressed the view that 
different political systems did not have to make good bilateral 
relations impossible. He acknowledged that an expansion of 
trade cooperation would be beneficial to both countries. 
  Both sides agreed to the need for the resumption of 
exchanges 
of students, which was stopped some years ago, the communique 
says.

<F P=106> [Article by PAD and K.G.R.: "Walesa Persuades in Gdansk; I </F>
Am Still A Man of Balance"] 
  [Text] The Constitution should be passed before the 
presidential elections. During the Friday [25 February] press 
conference in Gdansk Television, Lech Walesa was arguing that he 
is a supporter of passing the constitution quickly. He gave 
assurances that he is still "a man of balance." 
  "Because, really, something must be agreed on," he said when 
asked about the constitution. If the constitution is "so 
deformed" that it will not allow the president to be the prime 
minister of the government, Lech Walesa declares that "many 
people," including himself, will not agree to that. He argued 
that he does not want great power, but the possibility of making 
quick decisions. 
  According to Walesa, there is a possibility of building a 
coalition with the right-wing groupings. For the time being, 
Walesa is waiting "for someone to do this." He explains that he 
still wants to remain apolitical. If rightist leaders do not 
build such a coalition, he will organize it himself. He will 
then cease to be an apolitical president. He will take to 
"building a block which will allow us to do what should be 
done." Such a bloc will also help "win the next term of 
office," but it is a secondary task. 
  I am wondering whether such a romantic road that I am going 
on makes any sense in Poland at all, said Walesa. Perhaps the 
president should be linked to political configurations, have 
money, participate in making decisions concerning the granting 
of licenses, he wondered. 
  File-checking and decommunization must be carried out. 
Walesa does not say how this should be done. This should be 
discussed. 
  "It cannot be that the decisions made by the National 
Council 
of Radio and Television [KRRiT] are irrevocable. There are 
loopholes in the laws; if it should be necessary, some decisions 
of the council will have to be changed," stated Lech Walesa 
during the 25 February press conference. 
  In Gdansk the president once again complained about the work 
of KRRiT. He is wondering whether or not to recall its chairman 
before long. 
  Walesa believes that if "a few facts concerning the work of 
the council and the distribution of licenses" are revealed, the 
report of the council will be rejected by the Sejm. He did not 
rule out the possibility that the granting of licenses may be 
invalidated. 
  Discussing personnel issues, he said that he is convinced 
that if he has to build a pro-presidential bloc, "many of his 
closest aides will have to leave the Presidential Office." The 
president does not intend to cause a conflict by refusing to 
sign the appointment of a new finance minister. "If the prime 
minister approves of that person, I will sign the appointment 
because I support the prime minister," stated Walesa. According 
to the president, "Solidarity" and the people are right when 
they participate in demonstrations on the streets, because "it 
was supposed to be no longer that way." The president will 
persistently recall the pre-election declarations of the present 
government coalition so that "during the next elections the 
people will make the right 
choices." 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
<H5>  Is Drzycimski Leaving? </H5>
  Unofficial sources maintain that we can soon expect the 
recall of President Walesa's Press Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski. 
Asked about this by RZECZPOSPOLITA, Drzycimski answered that he 
neither confirms nor denies this. He added that "frequently the 
interested parties themselves are the last ones to hear 
decisions."

  [Text] For nearly one hour and a half Polish Television has 
transmitted a meeting between President Lech Walesa and 
journalists at the Gdansk television studios. At this televised 
news conference Walesa replied to many questions. Among other 
things he said the Constitution should be adopted before the 
presidential elections. We have for you but a few minutes from 
this long meeting. There are three questions, the first one 
about political options. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] You have 
recently called the right-wing leaders nincompoops. You said 
about the leader of the left that his idol was Stalin. About 
Solidarity you say it is no longer your Solidarity. So I wanted 
to ask what is your option. 
  [Walesa] I am carrying out precisely that which I have been 
asked to do by politicians, political parties, and the public. 
Recall, ladies and gentlemen, that during the period when I was 
forming the Belweder [presidential palace] set up, everyone 
thought that the president should be above parties, that he 
should not be linked to anyone, that he should be a mediator, 
that he should stand guard over, and so on. That is precisely 
what I have carried out. In connection with this today, I do 
not represent an option directly, although I have one. I hope I 
will not have to change this conception, which I also like. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Your choice, as far as the 
latest foreign visit was concerned, was Latvia. Latvia, as we 
all know, is probably the country most at conflict or at odds 
with the Russian Federation because of its Russian minority. At 
the same time the president voiced hard words--received, by me 
for instance, with satisfaction--addressed at Russia. Is the 
president playing out some sort of major issue here of, say, 
positioning with respect to a powerful neighbor? 
  [Walesa] Ladies and gentlemen: As far as my trips outside 
the country are concerned, this too is perceived in a variety of 
ways by the public. My trips are programmed by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. It is not my whim that I want to go somewhere. 
  Whereas as far as Latvia is concerned, it is indeed a big 
problem, and as far as Russia is concerned that is another 
problem. Ladies and gentlemen: Here there is--and yesterday, 
this sort of quarrel with you comes from us having enormously 
grand topics. [sentence as heard] For example, Russia and 
Latvia. Well, we have to speak about them. Is it just me who 
is supposed to speak about it? After all, we have stopped 
calling them to account for Katyn [burial site of murdered 
Polish officers in World War II], for the murders. The things 
that had been done, the things old Russia and the Soviet Union 
used to do, you just would not believe it; Hitler was a mere 
understudy. Don't you know that? 
  Now it is like this, we are now forgiving them, because it 
is 
no longer the same Russia, because there is no Soviet Union, we 
behave--we, we understand this. How does Russia reply to this? 
It wants to be a superpower! It wants us again in its embrace! 
  You have to--of course not like me just now, not so 
emotionally--you have to write about this, you have to tell the 
world: Listen, then it was our grandfathers and tomorrow it will 
be you, unless the whole of Europe defends itself against this, 
unless the whole of Europe says: Hang on a minute, is Poland 
free, Minister Kozyrev? Is it entitled to make independent 
decisions? What business is it of yours? 
  We do not threaten--we want a free Russia, we are going 
to--we are prepared to defend a free Russia. But say it the 
other way. Poland chooses its own partners. For as long as I am 
president no one is going to choose partners for me. I am going 
to do it in accordance with the will of the people. Will the 
Western partner withstand this? Well, here, as you can see, 
things vary. 
  During my term of office, I am going to want to bring about 
greater security in Europe, I am going to want greater 
prosperity. As I say, I am going to say what I think both to 
President Clinton and to President Yeltsin. I am not going to 
wear kid gloves. The truth will always be the truth and 
Poland's freedom will be Poland's freedom. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, regarding this 
question from the viewers, why are you overthrowing the 
government, why are you questioning the legality of the 
government, how do you intend to resolve your conflict with 
parliament? A whole series of questions, well, accusing you of 
badly arranging your relations with parliament and what are your 
answers... 
  [Walesa interrupting] Hang on a minute, hang on a minute, 
why 
is it that some people are always seeing me as the guilty one. 
I do not want to overthrow any government. I am just saying 
that the coalition said one thing and is doing another, that it 
proposed one program and is proposing another. That is one. I 
am not overthrowing any government. 
  Well, I think that the government should rule as long as 
possible but it should rule in accordance with the will of the 
people. But (?first)... 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I would like to pick up here, 
is 
that all right? 
  [Walesa] Hang on a minute, hang on a minute. So far, as you 
have noticed, between the government there have been no large 
conflicts. Of course there might have been some squabbles 
dragged into the daylight by journalists, but so far there has 
not been any conflict, let us make it clear, there is none from 
my side. 
  On the other hand with parliament, well, it arose not 
through 
me--there too there hadn't been a conflict, in spite of 
everything we walked about together without stepping on each 
other's toes. It was only when they rejected the first 
reading--and that was arrogance, that was spite--so I am not 
going to play spite. Ladies and gentlemen: I am, in spite of 
everything, the president. That is, even if I am merely 
submitting a draft, they should start discussion. I am not a 
little boy. In connection with this, it was not I who made this 
conflict, I would not have made it, I am a very accommodating 
man. But no one is going to walk all over me. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Relayed by TV Polonia Network; passages within quotation </F>
marks are recorded] 
  [Text] In President Lech Walesa's view, a constitution 
still ought to be adopted before the presidential elections next 
year. In the course of a meeting with journalists at Gdansk 
Television studios, Walesa stated that he had foreseen the 
conflicts against the background of the decision of the National 
Radio and Television Broadcasting Council on the matter of 
concessions for radio and television program broadcasting. The 
president announced that he will support various political 
forces so as to maintain equilibrium in the country. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] According to Walesa, the 
decisions contained in the new constitution ought to be intended 
to remove possible conflicts that could paralyze the executive 
power, and also widen the range of the president's prerogatives. 
  [Walesa] "I would wish that Poland be well steered. I would 
like -- the point is not, is not that I would like to have a lot 
of power, but an opportunity for quicker decisions, quite simply 
the undertaking of quicker decisions. Parliament ought to, 
really, concern itself above all with legal equipping [as 
heard], and not with ruling, not with the creation of 
coalitions, that is not the point." 
  [Correspondent] In Walesa's view, there is no other way out 
for Poland than a presidential system. The rejection by 
parliament of the presidential draft laws on the adoption of a 
Constitution was acknowledged by Walesa to be spitefulness on 
the part of the Sejm, and arrogance by the post-communists. The 
president does not acknowledge the withdrawal of his 
representative from the work of the [Sejm] Constitutional 
Commission to be the suspension of work on a constitution. 
  [Walesa] "I just say that the majority remain outside of 
parliament, and I will look on, and I am ready to, with this 
majority, to do something with this majority. On the subject of 
a constitution, I wanted, as the first approach, if the 
arrogance of parliament had not taken place, then I thought 
that, that what I propose will cause this majority to join in 
work on a constitution, together with this parliament. If it 
had not been rejected, then this draft had to succeed for me." 
  [Correspondent] Walesa said that he had envisaged that the 
decisions of the National Radio and Television Broadcasting 
Council would bring about a storm on the matter of concessions. 
In the president's view there does exist the possibility of the 
entire council's recall. 
  [Walesa] "If all these things turn out to be true, what was 
carried today in RZECZPOSPOLITA, and also a number of facts 
about which I in turn know, as the president, then this cannot 
end other than as I proposed. It is not true that I do not have 
any legal moves there. There are some. The law is none too 
precise. There are a number of moves that I can still make. I 
will strive, of course I told the lawyers to precisely check 
this, since I after all do not know the law so precisely. I 
would not wish that I be led into error. I really do not want 
to break any law." 
  [Correspondent] The president expressed himself in favor of 
an intelligently carried through decommunization and vetting 
procedure.

  [Text] A low-ranking official from the president's office 
will be taking part in the work of the parliamentary 
constitutional commission. This was announced by Lech Walesa 
today. 
  [Reporter] My representative, a lower-ranking one, is going 
to return to the commission for formal reasons, the president 
said before leaving Gdansk for Warsaw. It had seemed that the 
constitution should be created at the Sejm, but there is no good 
atmosphere for the president there, Lech Walesa said. He 
announced that in using a different political setup and other 
opportunities he will be preparing his own draft constitution 
and perhaps in the future, under favorable conditions, it might 
be possible to combine both. 
  Asked about reports in some newspapers to the effect that 
Piotr Kolodziejczyk is considering appointing a deputy national 
defense minister from among the present government coalition, 
President Walesa said: This appointment must not be made. 
Anyone who seriously thinks about the state knows that no 
divisions must be created. 
  He offered assistance to the heads of the presidential 
government departments. 
  Lech Walesa would not reply unambiguously to the question of 
whether his press spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski would be either 
resigning or dismissed in the immediate future. Are you feeling 
tired? he asked Drzycimski, and added: I don't think he looks 
all that bad yet.

<F P=106> [Article by Pawel Reszka: "Solidarity-Walesa; Short Tactical </F>
Flirt"] 
  [Text] "Solidarity" and the president, two political 
forces that have found themselves in opposition to the governing 
configuration, are at first glance sentenced to cooperation. 
However, there is not much hope for a lasting alliance between 
them. There are too many differences, too much distrust, and too 
few possible advantages--for one of the two parties at least. 
The president and his entourage are encouraging the trade union 
to cooperate; Solidarity may fear that the main beneficiary of 
the possible alliance would be Walesa. 
  In the last conflict with the parliament, the president 
resorted to anticommunist rhetoric. He started seeking allies 
that he could count on in this dispute, and in the long run--in 
the presidential elections: 
  "My dear Solidarity," he said at the last press conference. 
"I will never cut my links with 'Solidarity,'" he added. 
Andrzej Drzycimski has been recently persuading Marian 
Krzaklewski to meet with the president. 
<H5>  A Good Partner </H5>
  Solidarity is a good, possible partner for Walesa. It is 
beginning to regain strength and overcome the postelection 
crisis. It proved this during the 40,000-people demonstration 
which marched through the streets of Warsaw. The main slogan 
was "Down with Communists" and it was clear that the 
politically-diversified "Solidarity people" felt good in the old 
role, when they could jointly protest the return of the forces 
of the old configuration to power. The president is protesting 
against the same today; he even said that the people who protest 
are right, because "it was not supposed to be this way, but it 
is worse," even though he encouraged a fight on other platforms. 
  During the demonstration, Solidarity authorities saw to it 
that it did not reach the Belvedere; at the lead of the 
demonstration was the Gdansk Region, with a strong 
representation of the Gdansk Shipyard, which did not really feel 
like demonstrating against the president--there are more persons 
with similar views in the union. In an interview for 
RZECZPOSPOLITA, Solidarity Senate Speaker Stefan Jurczak did not 
rule out the possibility that the union may for the second time 
back up Walesa in the presidential elections. 
<H5>  Not Even A Step Further </H5>
  Solidarity and the president may soon start cooperation with 
each other. It seems, however, that this will not be a lasting 
cooperation. Members of the Solidarity authorities have several 
reasons why they should not go even a step further than it is 
necessary in an alliance with the president. 
  "It is Walesa who wants cooperation with Solidarity. Our 
question is what will we get out of that," says one member of 
the National Committee. The president may contribute to this 
marriage the authority of his office, the right to veto laws, 
the possibility of holding a referendum (the trade union wants, 
for example, a referendum on giving property to citizens), and 
the right to launch a legislative initiative. The problem is 
that the authority of the president is slightly eroded, which is 
shown by opinion polls, and the other rights may be difficult to 
take advantage of in a war with the parliament: The veto may be 
overridden, the Senate must approve the referendum, and the fate 
of the last legislative initiative of the president, which was 
rejected in the first reading, will discourage Lech Walesa from 
any new actions in this area. What the partners can do, then, 
is to take joint action in the opposition. This motivation may 
turn out to be sufficient only for a short time. All the more so 
because the relations between the president and Solidarity will 
become increasingly complex as 
<H5>  The Presidential Elections </H5>
  draw closer. Walesa will certainly want to lean on the trade 
union, where he still has numerous supporters. The present 
Solidarity leadership is rather skeptical about this idea. A 
similar situation developed last year, when the president wanted 
to come to the Solidarity congress and persuade the trade union 
to run in the parliamentary elections jointly with the Non-Party 
Bloc in Support of Reforms. The union leaders, who were 
determined to run separately, were indignant at the president 
and invited him only to the last day of the congress, when all 
the decisions had already been made. The president was offended 
because he was not given a chance to give it a try. 
  "I would not like to be in such a Solidarity, he said at 
that 
time. Now Walesa wants to give it a try once again. However, 
past animosities linger on--all the more so because after the 
congress conflict the influence of supporters and personal 
friends of the president within Solidarity considerably waned. 
We should also not forget about numerous Solidarity members who 
are firm opponents of Walesa, supporters of file-checking and 
cooperation with the right wing. Exceedingly close cooperation 
with Walesa would, then, have to cause greater or lesser 
quarrels within Solidarity. 
  Adding to all that are also personal ambitions of Marian 
Krzaklewski; some of his aides do not rule out the possibility 
that he is thinking about the presidency. He would be a 
candidate acceptable to the right wing--he is the chairman of 
the Constitutional Commission of the extra-parliamentary 
rightist groupings.

  [Text] The future "coalition" deputy minister of national 
defense will be responsible for contacts with the Sejm. The 
decision on establishing the post of "the parliamentary 
undersecretary of state" in the Ministry of National Defense 
[MON] was made during the talks with the participation of 
Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk. Jerzy Milewski, National Security 
Office head and secretary of state in MON, did not take part in 
the last stage of the negotiations. The first deputy of the 
national defense minister has been in the hospital for a week 
now. "The possibility cannot be ruled out that the personnel 
decisions will be made as early as next Monday [28 February)," 
Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki, MON spokesman, informed on 25 
February. Jerzy Szmajdzinski, general secretary of the Social 
Democracy of the Polish Republic, Sejm deputy of the Democratic 
Left Alliance, and chairman of the Sejm Defense Committee, 
confirmed on 25 February that the agreement on the filling of 
the post of the "political" deputy minister had been reached 
with the MON leadership. In line with the procedures, the 
candidate for the deputy minister should be proposed to the 
prime minister by the minister. "There already exists a list of 
candidates for the portfolio of the deputy minister," said 
Szmajdzinski; he firmly denied that his name is on that list. 
"The Government Press Office is not in the habit of acting 
before things actually happen. We issue information about 
recalls and appointments that have actually been made in the 
government," we heard on 25 February in the Office of the 
Council of Ministers.

<F P=106> [Statement by Polish Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy; place and </F>
date not given; from the "Caliber" Military Program--recorded] 
  [Text] Speaking in terms of strategic perspective, my view 
is that Poland is not safe, and everyone should become aware of 
that fact soon, and also implement the necessary measures in 
order to increase the feeling of safety. Second, there is the 
issue of financial means for the very urgent needs of the Army, 
in order to secure the Army's efficiency and 
effectiveness--there have been debates going on regarding that 
issue for some time now. The state budget presents an 
opportunity in that regard. I think that if additional revenues 
for the state budget emerge this year--there are people hoping 
that this will happen--then the Army's needs must definitely be 
taken into account. Third, I also think that there is no social 
awareness of the deteriorating security in the country and the 
resultant need to strengthen the Army's role so that the role 
can be played well in the future.

  [Text] Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec today 
returned from a two-day visit of Switzerland, where he had talks 
with his counterpart, Flavio Cotti, and with the president of 
the Swiss Confederation, Otto Stich. He had this to say, among 
other things, about the outcome of his trip: 
  [Begin Zieleniec recording] The character of the visit was 
primarily to put a seal on the present level of relations 
between our two countries. We have also signed mutual letters, 
in which we have confirmed the validity of obligations both 
countries have against each other in international law. 
Moreover, Switzerland is our important trade partner. Despite 
its being such a small country, it occupies 12th position in our 
trade relations with the outside world, which is very 
remarkable. It was therefore natural that we should have also 
discussed matters concerning the expansion of trade and economic 
cooperation. Swiss companies are participating with distinction 
in the process of the transformation of the economy. I have, 
however, also noted that the first swallows of our capital 
expansion, if I may say so, have appeared in Switzerland. Some 
of our companies have already set up mixed companies or branches 
directly in Switzerland. [end recording]

  [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, who is on a 
two-day official visit to Albania, after the talks with his host 
Albanian President Sali Berisha expressed support for the NATO 
air force action today against the Serb planes, which had been 
violating the UN resolution on the no-fly zone over 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He described it is a sign of resoluteness by the 
international community to oppose Serb aggression and Russian 
interference in the Balkans. We completely agree with 
international factors, the United States, the EU, and NATO 
showing greater resolve in suppressing aggression. We interpret 
this as a signal that the international community will continue 
to take resolute steps to end the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and create preconditions for peace, the Croatian president said. 
  In reply to Albanian journalists' questions, the Croatian 
president said NATO's latest move also demonstrated the 
resoluteness of the world's greatest super-power, the United 
States, to oppose Russian interference in the Balkans. As I 
have already said, I see this as a display of the resolve of the 
main European countries and the biggest world super-power, the 
United States, to oppose the Serb aggression, and, I would also 
say, Russian interference in the Balkans, Tudjman replied.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dusan Mitevic, "close associate" of </F>
President Slobodan Milosevic," by Albena Shkodrova, "especially 
for STANDART NEWS"; place and date not given: "If the Serbs 
Down U.S. Aircraft in Self-Defense, No One Will Be Able To Stop 
the War"] 
  [Text] People close to government circles in Belgrade say 
it is easier to get into Milosevic's office than to meet with 
Dusan Mitevic. The other thing that people say about this 
almost mythical figure is that if Mitevic had not existed, 
neither Milosevic nor Milan Panic would have appeared in Serbian 
politics. Mitevic is a close associate of Milosevic, and it is 
no secret that he will become prime minister if the Serbian 
president manages to win a majority in parliament. 
  Mitevic was a member of the Communist Party leadership in 
the 
former Yugoslavia as far back as in Tito's time and for many 
years, he was in charge of the state radio and television. "He 
had at least 5,000 people under him," people close to Mitevic 
claim. 
  At the moment, Mitevic is one of the leading economic 
figures 
in Belgrade. He is in charge of MP Holdings, which is actually 
"Milan Panic Holdings" -- a company registered in Los Angeles 
and owned by the former Yugoslav prime minister. In his spare 
time, Mitevic is the shadow ruler of the FRY. Albena Shkodrova 
interviewed him specially for STANDART NEWS. 
  [Shkodrova] Do you think NATO will fulfill its threat of 
launching air strikes against the Serbian positions in Bosnia? 
  [Mitevic] I believe that reason will prevail at the last 
moment. However, it is clear that the threat is perfectly 
serious. 
  I believe that all nations are good, but I do not believe in 
the abstract humanity of society. I am sure that the NATO 
countries are psychologically prepared to bomb us. Since they 
permitted bombardments in Somalia, Iraq, and other parts of the 
world, what will stop them allowing it here as well? 
  When I said that reason will prevail, I had in mind only 
that 
in the final analysis someone will calculate what the world will 
gain and what it will lose by undertaking this drastic military 
and political action. Only this logic will save the Serbs from 
bombardment. In this connection, I think it is of absolutely no 
importance whether they position this here or remove that from 
there. 
  Regarding the bombing issue, two big questions arise: 
  If NATO bombs the Serbs, it will be clear that the United 
Nations is no longer what it was, that the organization no 
longer acts as a world parliament, given that a military 
alliance (which NATO is) can calmly reject the view of the 
United Nations and walk over them. 
  In addition, it raises questions about international 
political order in general, about the laws governing the conduct 
of states and governments. I think that world public opinion 
should think carefully about what a precedent this creates for 
violating international order. 
  [Shkodrova] What is Russia's role in this? 
  [Mitevic] As a result of Gorbachev's policies, Russia is the 
United States' most important partner. If Washington disregards 
Russia, the forces in Russia that want it to conduct an 
independent policy will win the upper hand and put a question 
mark over the future of the Yeltsin administration. 
  As partners of the Russians, the Americans should carefully 
consider what they will gain and what they will lose from this 
operation. I can swear to you that they will gain nothing 
except negative consequences. 
  Bosnia is not Somalia. It is no desert. Here only the 
civilians will suffer, while nothing will happen to the 
military. The greatest danger is that in defending themselves, 
the Serbs may shoot down U.S. aircraft. Then no one will be 
able to stop the war -- the United States will have a reason to 
seek vengeance, and Russia will have to intervene as well. 
  If world public opinion is really interested in ending this 
war, why does it not simply apply pressure to the Muslims to 
make them sign the treaty proposed by the peace mediators. 
Under this treaty, the Muslims will get much more territory 
than they are entitled to, based on the size of their population. 
  [Shkodrova] What position do you expect Bulgaria to adopt in 
this situation? 
  [Mitevic] The position of nonintervention by the Balkan 
countries in the conflict that President Zhelev has been 
defending for a long time is in my view a very good one. 
Everyone should refrain from using weapons, because when two 
people are fighting, one should see who they are and separate 
them instead of everyone joining in the fight so that it is not 
clear who is hitting whom. 
  I hope the Bulgarians will realize this, because what is at 
issue is a historical conflict on a world scale. What is 
happening in Yugoslavia is merely a training exercise. It is 
part of the attempt to break up Russia. It is clear to the 
Western world that the Russian giant is dozing at the moment. 
Accordingly, they are trying to destroy him, to prevent him 
from ever rising to his feet again. 
  [Shkodrova] Do you consider that some EU countries are more 
guilty than others? 
  [Mitevic] Of course. In my opinion, everything that is 
happening in the former Yugoslavia is a result of Germany 
beginning to implement its policy in the Balkans. As far as 
they are concerned, the existence of our federation was always a 
barrier for them. 
  The present war is really a religious one. According to the 
Germans' plans, then want to separate off the Catholics -- the 
Croats and Slovenes, while Bosnia is supposed to become Muslim. 
This is a war against the Orthodox Christians. 
  [Shkodrova] When the war finally ends, do you think the 
Serbs will still face any charges of being the aggressor? 
  [Mitevic] So far the Serbs have been continuously condemned, 
including being blamed for things that have not been proved. 
For example, regarding the latest incident in Sarajevo not only 
is there no proof against the Serbs, but also there are many 
more signs pointing to the Muslims. Despite this, the Serbs 
were accused. 
  As far as guilt is concerned, the world is still arguing 
about who was responsible for World War I. 
  Everyone has made mistakes in this war. This is also true 
of the Western democratic states, which recognized Slovenia and 
Croatia -- and Bosnia as well -- much too early. This is 
precisely what provoked the conflict. The West interceded on 
the side of the Muslims, with whose policies neither the Serbs 
nor the Croats could agree. The strategy followed by [former 
German Foreign Minister] Genscher caused the conflict. 
  Long after the war has ended, the Serbs will have to prove 
what actually happened and it will take them many long years to 
remove the stain from their. Personally, I believe that in the 
end the truth will be understood. The question is how much it 
will cost. 
  [Shkodrova] Do you think any change may be expected in 
Serbia's foreign policy? 
  [Mitevic] No, the primary problem is to stop the war. After 
this, we will then think about paying more attention to our 
neighbors and to the security of the region. The Balkan nations 
will emerge from this war somewhat sobered up. The humanitarian 
aid that came to us through Bulgaria and Romania has drawn us 
closer to these countries. I think that our relations with them 
will become an important component of our foreign policy, 
because the events of last year have taught us something. If 
you recall, there was a play called "Australia Is Far Away"; our 
neighbors are most important for us. 
  I think that after the end of the war, the [former] Yugoslav 
peoples will once again draw closer together, and later all the 
Balkan countries will do the same thing. If we are together, 
this provides us with a great deal of power -- access to three 
seas and -- why not? -- a unified system of telecommunications, 
transportation, and so on.... Geographically speaking, our 
countries are destined to live side by side. 
  [Shkodrova] Do you think that Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] will no longer pose a problem in 
the Balkans? 
  [Mitevic] It is difficult to say because I am unable to 
foresee how the dispute between Greece and Macedonia will end. 
  However, Yugoslavia has an interest in this country 
[Macedonia] remaining as it is. What its name is does not 
bother us. 
  In actual fact, the dispute between Macedonia and Greece 
boils down to a linguistic dispute, and the pride and obstinacy 
of the two peoples have added fuel to the flames. I consider 
that both Serbia and Bulgaria should help Macedonia to develop 
in peace. The Macedonians have nothing to be afraid of. It was 
to some extent a hysterical reaction on Skopje's part to bring 
U.S. troops to Macedonia. 
  It seems to me that the problem of the Albanians is more 
important for the republic [of Macedonia], just as it is for us 
in Kosovo. 
  [Shkodrova] How likely is it that you will become prime 
minister of the FRY? 
  [Mitevic] To tell you honestly, I would not particularly 
want this to happen. I was a state servant for many years, but 
for the past two years, I have been in private business and have 
no desire at all to change my situation. A person who has had 
his tongue burned once always blows on his soup afterwards.

  [Text] The Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] 
republican assembly opened in Dunajska Streda this morning. It 
is attended by President Michal Kovac, who, in his greeting 
address, emphasized the importance of Hungarian political 
parties on our present political scene and said that 
difficulties arising in connection with minorities should be 
solved on the basis of civic principles. Equality of all 
citizens is the prime and basic cornerstone of democratic states 
and must not be questioned. 
  The speech by MKDH Chairman Vojtech Bugar analyzed the 
current political scene and emphasized that the MKDH considered 
that one of the most important tasks is to implement 
[Slovakia's] administrative and territorial division and to 
speed up putting self-administration in the sphere of education 
and culture on a legal basis.

  [Text] Rome, 28 February (TANJUG) -- It has been confirmed 
in the American Air Force base in Aviano in northeastern Italy 
that two American F-16 fighters from this base downed four 
planes this morning at 0530, 55 miles east of Banja Luka. U.S. 
fighter planes that returned to the base at around 0600 fired 
six "air-to-air" missiles at a group of six planes, sources in 
Aviano said. 
  The identity of the downed planes has not been officially 
confirmed yet, but it is presumed that they are Galeb planes 
belonging to the Serb republic air force.

  [Text] Dear viewers, we have just received a letter sent by 
President Alija Izetbegovic to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
  Dear Mr. Chancellor, I would like to thank you for your 
letter and for the efforts you are investing to help 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and our people. I am particularly grateful 
for the support Germany has lent us in the crucial moments 
before the withdrawal of the Serbian artillery from the hills 
surrounding Sarajevo. The residents of Sarajevo have lived to 
see the end of the two-year nightmare, during which one of every 
four citizens has been killed or wounded. 
  However, the city is still under blockade, and Serbian 
artillery withdrawn from around Sarajevo has obviously been 
redeployed on other battlefields, which has disturbed the 
balance of power on those battlefields. Maglaj and Bihac have 
come under heavy attacks, which could result in thousands of 
fresh victims and further ethnic cleansing. 
  I believe that the final elimination of Serbian artillery is 
a condition for any serious political negotiations. The current 
military imbalance to the advantage of the Serbian side has 
turned the peace negotiations into a diktat. 
  Our hopes for a speedy denouement to the Bosnian crisis are 
linked to resolving our misunderstandings with the Croatians. 
We signed a cease-fire agreement which is to come into effect 
on 25 February. I hope that this time the Croatians will honor 
the agreement and withdraw their forces which, according to the 
UN secretary general's report, consist of at least 5,000 
soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Croatia. The 
involvement on the part of Germany and the United States would 
probably help Bosnia and Croatia find a solution to this 
situation, and to re-establish cooperation in many areas. 
  Yours sincerely, 
  Alija Izetbegovic

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej Olechowski </F>
by correspondent Grazyna Bukowska in Warsaw on 27 February; from 
the "Wiadomosci" bulletin--live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Olechowski] Good evening. 
  [Bukowska] Does the fact that the leaders of the Moscow 
August [as heard] coup have been set free change in any way our 
relations with Russia? Can this be seen as a threat to the 
partnership and to our relations in general? 
  [Olechowski] It can constitute a threat to everyone because 
it seems the situation in Russia is once again becoming tense. 
Again there is conflict between the president and parliament. 
There is no way one can tell how things will develop, whether 
they will move toward some sort of national accord--although it 
is not known what the basis for such accord would be--or whether 
the situation will develop toward confrontation. I am afraid 
that news developments will keep us in suspense. 
  However, fundamental and neighbourly relations cannot be 
ruined of course. They will be influenced by the fact that we 
cannot afford to--how to put it--be completely open in this 
situation with regard to Russia, which we could be today in 
different circumstances; provided we were internally convinced 
and without any doubt that we have sorted out our own problems 
with regard to relations with the West, that we knew were we 
were going and what our place was. 
  [Bukowska] You talk about openness. Isn't it that Russia is 
constantly trying to exert pressure on us and on European policy 
in general. Isn't it the case that Russia wants a situation 
where nothing can happen without it. Is our concept of foreign 
policy toward Russia perhaps too soft? One reads these 
commentaries that you are simply too soft as far as Russia is 
concerned... 
  [Olechowski] No, it is not like this. As I said, we know 
where we want to be, that we want to be part of the European 
Community, NATO, and western European institutions. The fact 
that Russia does not like it, that Russia does not generally 
like these institutions is understandable. Russia is a great 
country and a superpower. It has a different perception of the 
world and, of course, would like to have an impact on 
everything. It is understandable. A great country thinks in a 
different way than a small country. This does not mean that we 
have to change our way of thinking because our big neighbour 
thinks this way. No, and that is why we have no hesitations 
here. We are not faltering here. We are walking toward the 
West firmly and at a steady pace each day, and we do not have to 
talk about this with Russia because we are not moving in the 
direction of Russia. 
  [Bukowska] Thank you very much for the interview.

<TEXT>
Article   Type:CSO 

  [Text]Translating material from the press of the Hungarian 
minorities in Romania, Slovakia, Serbia, and Ukraine presents 
several difficulties. In the original text, cities and other 
geographic areas are called by their traditional Hungarian 
names, which are usually different from the official names used 
in the majority language. In addition, parties and organizations 
are often designated by unexpanded acronyms, and it is not even 
always clear whether these are derived from the Hungarian or 
from the majority language. Moreover, some designations are 
politically sensitive due to territorial disputes or historical 
considerations. 
  FBIS has adopted the following guidelines for handling such 
material. The guidelines assume that the translator has access 
to the bilingual list of place names published in Budapest: 
(MAGYAR NEVE? Hatarokon tuli helysegnev-szotar; Arany Lapok, 
1990). Since the Ukrainian section of the book gives the Russian 
form and is therefore obsolete, a partial Hungarian/Ukrainian 
list of place names is included below (p.6). In addition, lists 
of party and organization acronyms are provided. 
<H5>  I. Use of Bilingual Place Names and Acronyms </H5>
  Translations should give the majority-language form of place 
names and organizations that is approved by the Board of 
Geographic Names (BGN) gazetteer, because this is the 
internationally recognized form found on maps. At the same time, 
the source's use of the Hungarian should be indicated because it 
reflects the original material and may have political 
implications. The following guidelines address both requirements: 
  1. In the headline and subslug, use the majority language 
version of the place or organization (in the latter case, 
usually an acronym). 
  2. In the text, use whatever place name or acronym is used 
in 
the original. If this is in Hungarian, cross-reference the 
majority-language version in a bracketed editorial note on its 
first appearance in the item. 
  3. As is indicated by the above, the English acronym is not 
used. 
  Example: 
  Marko Interviewed at UDMR Conference in Oradea 
  Bucharest ROMANIAI MAGYAR SZO in Hungarian 19 Jun 93 p 9 
  [Interview with Bela Marko, chairman of the Democratic Union 
of Hungarians in Romania, by Janos Szabo in Oradea; date not 
given: "Marko on Future Role of UDMR"] 
  [Text] Shortly after his arrival in Nagyvarad [Oradea], Bela 
Marko, president of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in 
Romania [RMDSZ--in Romanian, UDMR], gave an interview to our 
paper. 
  [Szabo] What do you expect the RMDSZ to achieve here in 
Nagyvarad? 
  [Marko] I hope that we can resolve some of the problems we 
encountered at last month's session in Kolozsvar [Cluj], where 
the Hungarian Smallholders Party of Romania [RMK--in Romanian, 
PMGMR].... 
<H5>  II. List of Acronyms </H5>
  The following lists are incomplete but include most of the 
acronyms used in the Hungarian minority press of these countries 
in 1993. When possible, both the Hungarian and majority-language 
acronyms are listed and cross-referenced because the minority 
press sometimes uses them interchangeably. NOTE: The 
translation of "szovetseg" and several similar words--translated 
variously as union, alliance, federation, and association--could 
not be standardized because of previously established variations 
in common usage.

Hungary until 1920, now northern Serbia and Croatia]. Do not 
translate. Use the original, putting the above in brackets after 
the first occurrence in the text. Avoid in headlines. 
  Dunantul = [Hungary west of the Danube river] Do not 
translate as Transdanubia, because it may not be clear whether 
the region east or west of the Danube is meant. Use the 
original, putting the above in brackets after the first 
occurrence in the text. Avoid in headlines. Note that the suffix 
"tul" (beyond) indicates west of the Danube but east of the the 
Tisza (see below). 
  Felvidek (or felvidek) = ["Upper country"--northern Hungary 
until 1920, now Slovakia] Do not translate. Use the original, 
putting the above in brackets after the first occurrence in the 
text. Avoid in headlines. 
  Karpatalja = The area of Ukraine on the Western side of the 
Carpathian mountains. In headlines and subslugs, translate as 
"Transcarpathia," which reflects the Ukrainian term for the 
region. However, in the text, translate as Subcarpathia 
(reflecting the Hungarian original). After the first occurrence 
of Subcarpathia in the text, put [Ukraine's Transcarpathian 
region] in brackets. NOTE: When rendering the official 
majority-language form of a place name, use the Ukrainian form 
(rather than the Russian as previously in Soviet times). A 
transliterated list of common place names is appended. 
  Kiralyhagomelleki Reformatus Egyhaz = Kiralyhagomelleki 
[Pasul Craiului (Oradea)] Reformed Church District. NOTE: 
Put Romanian term in brackets after the first occurrence 
only. 
  Magyar = Hungarian 
  Always translate--do not use "Magyars," etc. When the text 
requires distinguishing between citizens of Hungary and 
Hungarians living in other countries, qualify as appropriate 
with a term in brackets: [minority] Hungarians; [ethnic] 
Hungarians; [emigre] Hungarians. 
  Magyarsag (1) = all Hungarians everywhere. 
  Example: A magyarsag erti Istvan kiralynak a. 
  All Hungarians everywhere understand King Stephen's. 
  Magyarsag (2) = being Hungarian; Hungarian identity. 
  Example: Buszke a magyarsagara. 
  He is proud of being Hungarian. 
  Example: Amerikaban is megorizte a magyarsagat. 
  Even in America, he kept his Hungarian identity. 
  nemzet = nation; people 
  nemzetiseg = ethnic minority; ethnic group; nationality 
(citizenship) 
  nemzeti kisebbseg = national minority 
  nemzetalkoto elemek = constituent elements of the nation 
  tarsnemzet = co-nation 
  Szekely = Szekler 
  Szekler is the appropriate English translation, but it is 
obscure. Therefore, avoid in headlines, and put the following in 
brackets after the first occurrence in the text: [sub-group of 
the Hungarian minority in the Transylvanian region of Romania]. 
  Tiszantul = [the region of Hungary east of the Tisza river] 
Do not translate. Use the original, putting the above in 
brackets after the first occurrence in the text. Avoid in 
headlines.

<F P=106> [Article on a news conference by Vladimir Meciar, Slovak </F>
prime minister and chairman of the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS), Jan Slota, chairman of the Slovak National 
Party (SNS), and Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the 
Democratic Left (SDL), with unidentified correspondents in 
Bratislava on 28 February--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Top officials of the HZDS and the SNS met for 
regular coalition talks today. HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar 
and SNS Chairman Jan Slota briefed journalists on the results of 
the talks at an impromptu meeting: 
  [Meciar] Both parties agreed on fundamental talks [zasadne 
rozhovory] with the SDL on how to stabilize and assess the 
situation. As for the developments in the most immediate 
future, we have to take into consideration several new facts. 
  First, representatives of the Association of Towns and 
Villages strongly protest against the possibility that communal 
elections could coincide with the national elections. 
  Second, by 25 February, over 400,000 people said in a 
petition that they were in favor of a referendum as a means of 
solving the present political situation and of tackling all 
three questions. As far as I know, the petition committee later 
relaxed its activities because it obtained many more signatures 
than needed, and many more were still interested in signing. 
  Third, we cannot allow the parliamentary crisis to change 
into a permanent one. It would affect economic and social 
relations in such a way that the political climate would 
eventually result in the deterioration of the economy and of 
social welfare. It would be the people who would pay for it--in 
prices, pensions, etc. That is threatening the state. It is in 
the interest of the state--we both agreed on this--to hold 
elections as soon as possible. The date of 24-25 June 1994 
seems to us to be the most suitable. However, the HZDS and the 
SNS together do not have enough votes to be able to push these 
dates through in parliament. That is why we need to hold talks 
with other political parties. 
  [Correspondent] Which parties come under consideration? 
  [Meciar] The SDL. We have agreed that both parties would 
hold talks with the SDL. 
  [Slota] Clearly, June is the most suitable election time for 
the SNS. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Is there any realistic chance that the SDL 
and the HZDS would agree on the date of early elections, which 
should be, as the prime minister said today, the end of June 
1994? 
  [Weiss] There is no realistic chance for that. We have 
received no official offer for talks. I do not know on what 
grounds the prime minister gave you such information.

  [Excerpts] At the session in Vyhne on 27 February, the 
republican leadership of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
[HZDS] asked the movement's political board to discuss the 
possibility of stepping up cooperation in the future with other 
political entities. The HZDS is counting on its coalition 
partner, the Slovak National Party, in order to form an election 
bloc, and is also considering as its partners the Christian 
Social Union, the Farmers' Party of Slovakia, and the Party of 
the Greens in Slovakia. Preliminary talks have already been held 
with these parties. 
  We asked the representatives of potential partners of the 
ruling movement about the conditions under which they would be 
willing to accept an offer for coalition cooperation. 
  Speaking on behalf of the Christian Social Union [KSU] is 
Deputy Chairman Viliam Oberhauser: 
  [Begin Oberhauser recording] In a period when further 
fragmentation of political forces is taking place, the KSU is 
looking for possibilities to bring these forces together because 
it is precisely this solution that Slovakia needs in the present 
period. [passage omitted] 
  We have been engaged in talks with other partners--the 
Slovak 
National Party and the HZDS. We are open to everyone willing to 
form an association on national and Christian principles and on 
the principle of solving the social problems of the Slovak 
people. [passage omitted] [end recording] 
  The resolution adopted by the delegates to the Second 
Congress of the Farmers' Party of Slovakia, which took place in 
Martin on 26 February, spoke of the party's willingness to 
cooperate with the HZDS. Miroslav Makson, the party's deputy 
chairman, outlines his party's position on this issue. 
  [Begin Makson recording] We are and we wish to be a 
political 
party of the center. From this viewpoint, the HZDS is 
objectively the most suitable political partner. I think that, 
apart from this fact, it is precisely the HZDS that has the 
same--and on some points even identical--agrarian program as the 
Farmers' Party of Slovakia. 
  On the basis of this fact, the delegates to the congress 
arrived at the conclusion that the HZDS is the most suitable 
political partner for us. The delegates themselves confirmed, 
as it were, that the HZDS would do more for the farmers than 
they have managed to do so far if the current political 
situation were more stabilized. [passage omitted] 
  Just the attitude of the prime minister and HZDS Chairman 
Meciar toward farming provides a certain political guarantee 
that farming will gradually be developed. [passage omitted] 
[end recording] 
  Our colleague Peter Turcik telephoned Jozef Pokorny, 
chairman 
of the Party of the Greens in Slovakia, and asked him under what 
conditions the party would be willing to enter into a coalition 
with the HZDS. 
  [Begin recording] [Pokorny] [passage omitted] Our condition 
for a possible entry into a coalition or an election bloc--and 
by this I do not mean just the HZDS, but also other partners 
that have already approached us--is respect for environmental 
protection, a positive attitude toward environmental 
legislation, and the preservation of the state administration 
governing the environment, which has been under discussion for 
more than two years. [passage omitted] 
  [Turcik] Are you ready to enter into this coalition provided 
the HZDS offer is actually finalized? 
  [Pokorny] I do not link this intention to only one 
movement--in other words, the HZDS. We have received this offer 
from the HZDS, but it is up to the party's membership to decide 
on this issue. In no case do the Greens want to be 
swallowed--and I can guarantee that this is not going to 
happen--by another powerful party that talks about the 
environment only before the elections and forgets all about it 
after it has joined the parliament. We saw this happen in the 
past. [passage omitted] [end recording]

Serbia"] 
  [Text] Turija, 25 Feb -- Today's launching of regular 
production in the first phase of the "Turija North 1" oil field 
in the vicinity of Srbobran marks the 45th anniversary of the 
Serbian oil company "Naftagas." 
  The "Turija North 1" oil field is the largest of its kind 
discovered in Serbia over the past three decades. According to 
"Naftagas" manager Srboljub Stankovic, Turija and the eastern 
part of Srbobran literally stand on oil. The subterranean field, 
situated between two points at a depth of 2,000 meters is coated 
in a layer of oil 47 meters thick. 
  Some $60 million has so far been invested in the "Turija 
North 1" oil field. This year, another $32 million is needed 
for the second phase of construction, while the third phase -- 
the construction of transportation systems and oil and gas 
pipelines calls for another $11 million. 
  Around 86,000 metric tons of oil were produced in this area 
last year. This year, the production of 120,000 tons of oil is 
planned. 
  Vladimir Zivanovic, republican minister for energy, was 
among 
the many guests who attended today's celebrations.

  [Text] Reports from Prishtina confirm that the Serbian 
Army continues its movements throughout Kosova. Some 200 
Serbian soldiers, tanks, and other heavy artillery have been 
deployed in Kacanik city. Near Kacanik, at Hani i Elezit, a 
border point between Kosova and FYROM [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia], the Serbian army killed another Albanian 
today -- 60-year-old Selman Pajazit Daci. 
  The Kosova Information Center reports that Selman Daci was 
killed by the Serbian soldiers on the Prishtina-Skopje road. 
Other details have not been announced so far. 
  There are reports of concentrations of the Serbian forces at 
a place called Cuka e Komoranit, near Gllogovc. A total of 13 
tanks, dozens of military trucks, and other heavy artillery have 
been stationed there.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb. 28, IRNA -- Soldiers of the Serbian 
Army shot dead a 60 year old Albanian Muslim, according to the 
Kosovo information centre Monday. Selman Daci was killed on the 
Kosovo side of the high road, about one mile from the border 
with The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the centre said. 
  The centre also reports large-scale troop movements this 
weekend by the Serbian-Montenegrin army in this southern 
province of the former Yugoslavia. 
  In a statement sent to IRNA, the centre said that dozens of 
units of the Serbian Army, including about 10 tanks and several 
long-range guns walked into a village near the Kosovo capital of 
Pristina last Friday, provoking the inhabitants. The units, the 
statement said, were stationed in nearby hills. 
  The same day, heavy army units moved out of a barracks in 
Prizren, near the Albanian border, while heavy weapons which had 
been positioned nearby, were moved closer to the town. Other 
units with 30-40 tanks and armoured vehicles moved to a village 
near Podujevo, just north of Pristina, the same source said. 
  On Sunday afternoon, some 13 tanks, a dozen military trucks 
and a large number of soldiers and officers were stationed near 
the village of Komoran and there was much movement by the army 
in several other places in Kosovo. 
  Following the abolition of the province's autonomy four 
years 
ago, Serbia keeps a large military and police presence to 
maintain repression in Kosovo, where the population is 90 per 
cent Albanian Muslim.

<F P=106> [Interview with Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee </F>
Chairman Jiri Payne by Jaroslav Fiala; place and date not given: 
"There Are Plenty of Opportunities for Our Exports to the United 
States"] 
  [Text] We interviewed Deputy Payne on his recent visit to 
the United States. 
  [Fiala] Many people associate your visit to the United 
States with your remarks about the lists of State Security 
agents. What, in fact, was the aim of your visit to the United 
States? 
  [Payne] I was invited on behalf of U.S. President Clinton 
and his wife to a traditional prayer breakfast to which people 
who try to assert certain Christian values are invited. Some 
are politicians, others are involved in charity work, and so on. 
Within the framework of this invitation, I tried to use my 
visit to the United States to hold further meetings in the U.S. 
Congress and the [State] Department. This is, in essence, in 
compliance with the idea that we should try to provide more 
information about the Czech Republic abroad. Each contact of 
this kind creates a special platform for us. For example, one 
day it will be necessary to vote on certain issues of 
fundamental interest to the Czech Republic, so this creates a 
better setting for us. 
  [Fiala] Who did you meet in the United States? 
  [Payne] Within the program arranged for the extra days of my 
visit, I visited the Security Committee, where a debate was 
taking place on expanding NATO in the presence of the U.S. 
ambassador in NATO from Brussels; I met the chairman of the 
Congress Foreign Affairs Committee, Lee Hamilton; I met the 
distinguished Senator Lugar, who is known for being very well 
informed about Central Europe because he deals with this region; 
and I also met with other members of Congress. I would describe 
Partnership for Peace and our reaction to it as the main topic 
we discussed. It was the same at the State Department. 
  [Fiala] Did you discuss economic issues with anyone? 
  [Payne] I tried to make use of a few more days on the basis 
of urgent appeals from our honorary consul in Florida, Alan 
Becker, to visit this area and meet with business circles who 
are already doing business in the Czech Republic or are 
interested in doing business there. I have to say that these 
meetings were very useful and that, during my talks with our 
honorary consul and while going over certain data, we came 
across extensive areas where our business activity could be 
expanded. It is significant that hundreds of thousands of 
tonnes of Czech goods pass through the port of Miami, and so it 
seems that this is really a contact, a place, that is very 
important for us because of its trade links to Latin America, 
the United States, and Mexico, and, from this point of view, I 
think that we should look into the fact that we can single out 
new opportunities for our exports in this area. 
  [Fiala] What did you discuss at the meeting with 
compatriots? 
  [Payne] We briefed them on the situation in the Czech 
Republic. Minister Lux briefed them on agriculture, Mr. Kasal 
on the general work in parliament, and I gave them a rough 
outline of the basic priorities of our foreign policy, which was 
the main theme of that evening. Then, we answered a whole 
series of questions, which were asked quickly one after the 
other; the atmosphere here was very relaxed. 
  [Fiala] You mentioned that making contacts and holding talks 
abroad forms part of your specific idea about foreign policy. 
Could you be more explicit? 
  [Payne] I have discussed this with a number of colleagues, 
and we even view it as one of the priorities of the work of the 
Chamber of Deputies because at times the situation arises that 
members of other parliaments have insufficient information about 
the Czech Republic or they are given somewhat imprecise 
information. Therefore, we consider this activity to be very 
important. In this context, I would like to cite the following 
example: We worked for about a year on formulating the 
conditions for the approval of the European Agreement in the 
European Parliament. I had many meetings with European 
Parliament deputies within the framework of this activity, and 
the upshot was that the approval was given in just under three 
weeks, which is quite unique in European history. I have to 
emphasize that this was due especially to the endeavor of the 
rapporteur on the European Agreement, Mr. Sakallariou, and 
others. Apart from this, our Association or European Agreement 
was approved by such a percentage of votes that everyone voted 
in favor except, I think, three deputies who abstained and one 
who was against. In my opinion, this is the reward of such 
lobbying. Of course, if the economic, political, and other 
prerequisites had not been created, we would never have achieved 
such a result. On the other hand, if they have been created, it 
is necessary to make the maximum possible use of them.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Lamper and Jaroslav Spurny: "Through </F>
Tehran Into NATO, and Toward Full Employment"] 
  [Text] "Finally, we have clear rules of the game. 
However, this will not protect the Czech arms factories from 
being scandalized by foreign competitors, who have described the 
Czech Republic as a `dealer in death.'" This is how Jan Vlcek, 
director of the RDP arms consortium, commented on the government 
bill on the export of military technology. The press published 
this statement on 28 January 1994. By coincidence, the letter 
in which Engineer Vlcek, in the name of the RDP Group, asks 
Minister of Industry Dlouhy for help in obtaining arms export 
licenses to Iran bears the same date. 
<H5>  This Is Not Your Business </H5>
  As recently as mid-January, the RDP management vehemently 
denied any contacts between their company and the Iranian 
regime. "That is just rumor and gossip. We are sticking to the 
line of Czech foreign policy," Director Vlcek told RESPEKT at 
the time. Shortly after that, it became clear that the contrary 
was true. Documents confirming that Lubomir Soudek, Skoda 
director general and chairman of the RDP Presidium, had held 
talks on possible deliveries of surface-to-surface missiles and 
the modernization of T-72 tanks with Iranian Government 
officials in Teheran at the beginning of December of last year 
were published (see RESPEKT No. 3/94 for details). When this 
fact surfaced, the arms producers kept a cool head. "It is no 
one's business what negotiations we are conducting, and with 
whom. If someone wants to make an affair of it, then he should 
not be surprised if the unemployment rate goes up," Soudek told 
reporters. 
  The official reaction was unequivocal: The RDP Group's plan 
regarding Tehran is doomed to failure because it is impossible 
to acquire export licenses for military technology to Iran at 
this time. On 18 January, MLADA FRONTA DNES even quoted an 
"anonymous source from diplomatic circles," who said: "If Mr. 
Soudek behaves like this in Iran after the bill on arms exports 
is passed, his activity could be considered criminal." 
  Ten days after this statement, Jan Vlcek wrote his letter to 
the minister of industry, and, within the next 10 days, the said 
bill passed. Vladimir Dlouhy submitted the arms consortium's 
request to his three colleagues from the government (the 
interior minister, defense minister, and foreign minister). 
According to Engineer Fritzl of the Licensing Office of the 
Ministry of Industry and Trade, their opinion is awaited. 
Reportedly, the official rejective stance on military trade 
with Tehran has not changed. The RDP chiefs are equally 
committed, however. 
<H5>  An Untrustworthy Man </H5>
  According to military experts, the only thing the RDP Group 
can do is to persist. Their most ambitious program--to 
modernize the T-72 tank in cooperation with French partners--has 
oriented them, from the very beginning, toward very risky 
markets. There are about 8,000 [T-72 tanks] in the world that 
are of Soviet origin. Of these, about half are in the countries 
of the former Warsaw Pact, and the rest in countries such a 
Syria, China, Iran, and Iraq. Several pieces are also in NATO 
states--for instance, the United States has four, but these 
tanks are antiques to be put on display in museums, and the 
owners do not want to modernize them. 
  When Lubomir Soudek and Jan Vlcek established the arms group 
in the summer of last year, their plans were mainly based on the 
orders of the Czech Army. It was expected that the RDP Group 
would use the know-how of the French firm SOFMA while 
modernizing domestic machines. The Army, however, turned down 
the offer. According to the officials from the Defense 
Ministry, economic reasons played their role when the decision 
was made (the adaptation of one tank costs 45 million korunas 
[Kc] in RDP prices, which would swallow the whole 1994 Army 
budget if we wanted to modernize all of the 540 tanks of our 
Army), as well as personal reasons. "Mr. Vlcek is an 
untrustworthy man and his personality is unacceptable to us," 
Defense Ministry Spokesman Zdenek Borkovec says. Minister 
Baudys is of the same opinion: "The RDP Group director general 
is suggesting utilizing the capacity of our Army, without ever 
discussing this subject with the Army. In view of the 
questionable trading activities of the consortium, I consider 
the participation of the Czech Army in these projects as quite 
out of the question." 
<H5>  Partners in the Background </H5>
  Foreign markets are absolutely not interested in the arms 
the 
manufacturer is unable to sell even to the Army in his country. 
Countries whose reputations are such that no one can openly 
offer them anything are the only exception. Trade with them may 
be lucrative, but there is a catch. When they come to light, 
they mean a scandal for the exporting country. The perseverance 
with which the RDP Group is pushing for its Iranian contract 
shows that the management of the consortium decided to take 
risks. Reportedly, they have already invested Kc10 million in 
the T-72 modernization program without having moved a single 
step forward. The efforts to sell "repair lines" to Iran are 
seen by experts as logical. The experts, having applicable 
documentation, could, on Vlcek's call, make the first steps 
toward the conclusion of the main deal: Adjustment of the 
Iranian T-72's on the basis of French technology and know-how. 
  "The French partners to the RDP Group play a key role in 
the intended trade. Their profit would be adequate, but they 
would bear practically no risk," an official from the Ministry 
of Industry and Trade Licensing Department told RESPEKT 
reporters. If the deal fails, nothing will happen. SOFMA has 
offered its know-how not only to the Czech arms manufacturers. 
It has successfully sold it to Poland and Slovakia, and 
negotiations with the Bulgarians are reportedly under way. If 
Soudek's and Vlcek's RDP obtains the license, SOFMA will get on 
the Iranian market, something it cannot do for the time being. 
Only the Czech side bears the risk of the possible scandal. 
  According to available statements from responsible 
officials, 
it seems that the contract with Iran will not be authorized. 
"The fact is, however, that a very intensive lobby is being 
established here. They will try to push for their interests as 
much a possible," Engineer Samek, supreme director of the 
Licensing Administration, commented on the course of the "Iran 
case." Information provided to RESPEKT confirms his words 
indirectly. Apart from Iran, the RDP Group also offered to 
modernize Syria's "72's." This happened during Director Vlcek's 
trip to Damascus last summer. Syrian General Hussain Al Ali came 
to Prague to confirm the deal at the beginning of November. The 
RDP Group management refused to answer any questions on the 
matter.

  "I think," continued the minister, "that if we succeed in 
finding a common language between the representatives of our 
industry and the Turkish TAI group, which manufactures these 
aircraft under the license and management of Lockheed, this 
could be a very important and considerable boon for our air 
industry, which I personally very much admire. It would be a 
pity to miss out on this. Various options for buying were also 
discussed. Turkey is a major customer of our arms plant in 
Uhersky Brod. It purchases a considerable number of pistols and 
is also interested in some other products." The minister did not 
specify which ones, however, "because the market in military 
materials is known for its tough competition." He confirmed that 
the Tamara radar system was not discussed. 
  Deputy Defense Minister M. Kalousek said at a news 
conference 
this week that "no consideration is being given this year to 
purchasing modern military equipment for the Czech Army." He 
said that it is impossible to say how much money will be 
released up to the year 2005 for the modernization of the Air 
Force. "The project for a multipurpose aircraft from Aero 
Vodochody is a viable scheme," said Kalousek.

  [Text] Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus received Jozef Oleksy, 
speaker of the Polish Sejm, at the government office today. Our 
correspondent David Stahlavsky reports: 
  [Stahlavsky] The Polish guest regards the visit as a further 
step in the process of strengthening goodneighborly relations 
between our two countries. Jozef Oleksy visited Bratislava last 
week. 
  The agenda of his talks with the prime minister, the foreign 
minister, and President Vaclav Havel later in the afternoon 
included European issues and other issues important for both 
Poland and the Czech Republic. 
  At a joint news conference, the speaker of the Polish Sejm 
described his talks with Klaus as businesslike and interesting. 
They were talks that brought a pragmatic contribution to 
relations between Poland and the Czech Republic. He focused, in 
particular, on reforms in both states. Welcoming the outcome of 
the talks, Oleksy said: 
  [Begin Oleksy recording, in Polish with superimposed Czech 
translation] The prime minister's statement that relations with 
Poland are an absolute priority for the Czech Republic was of 
enormous importance for me. I fully share the prime minister's 
view that Western Europe has much to learn from our two 
countries. We said that Europe needed a broad and fresh 
dialogue and that no institutions could substitute for this 
dialogue. [end recording] 
  Speaking about the visit of the Polish Sejm speaker, Klaus 
said the following: 
  [Begin Klaus recording] I would like to say, in fact, that I 
am very glad that this visit is taking place because we need to 
overcome certain misunderstandings that exist with regard to 
Czech-Polish relations. For me, personally, it is not just a 
phrase to say that relations between the Czech Republic and 
Poland take a high priority in our policy. I am convinced that 
they must be perpetuated not only on government and parliament 
levels but on all other levels. [end recording] 
  [Stahlavsky] Klaus and Oleksy discussed the strengthening of 
economic relations, the increase of mutual investments, and the 
use of Polish debt to the former Czechoslovakia. After the 
division of the federation, the Czech Republic share of claims 
is $68 million. Klaus rejected the initial proposal that this 
balance should be offset by deliveries of Polish coal because 
the Czech Republic has a surplus of coal. 
  The speaker of the Polish Sejm recalled the current concept 
according to which the debt should be used to improve the 
infrastructure along the common border and on ecology-related 
projects.

  [Text] The Czech Parliament's Chamber of Deputies Foreign 
Committee delegation began a four-day visit to Germany today. 
Our Bonn correspondent, Jiri Halousek, has more information. 
  [Halousek] The Foreign Committee delegation is formed by 10 
deputies from our Chamber of Deputies. The delegation was 
received by Hans Stercken, chairman of the Bundestag Foreign 
Committee, this morning. He told me after the first round of 
talks that, besides a number of shared views and interests, 
there were also some issues that were left open in the 
Czech-German agreement. Although these issues cannot be 
resolved within two weeks, we have to have a plan on the basis 
of which we can resolve them. The deputies should take a more 
active part in setting up this plan. 
  Jiri Payne, chairman of the Czech Foreign Committee, summed 
up his first impressions with these words. 
  [Begin Payne recording] I must say that, surprisingly, we 
have assured each other that both sides were interested in new 
contacts. I think that this is a good start for our talks in the 
approaching days. [end recording] 
  [Halousek] This afternoon, our deputies delegation visited 
the Defense Ministry in Bonn. The deputies were received by 
Deputy Defense Minister Bernd Wilz, who said after the meeting: 
  [Begin Wilz recording in German, fading into Czech 
translation] I believe that the NATO Partnership for Peace 
proposal is at present the right thing to do in the interest of 
the two countries--the Czech Republic and Germany--and the whole 
NATO Alliance. Of course, our long-term goal is equal security 
to all in Europe. [end recording] 
  [Halousek] Bernd Wilz went on to say that the agreement on 
military cooperation between the two countries had already been 
signed, that Czech officers had been studying at military 
schools in Germany for four years now, and that good relations 
had developed between [military] units in the border area. It 
will be possible to launch joint military exercises, although 
their relevant legal basis still needs to be set up.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tomas Fejfar, deputy chairman of the </F>
parliamentary Defense and Security Committee, by Nada 
Adamickova; place and date not given: "Almost Nothing Has 
Changed in the Army Over the Past Three Years"] 
  [Text] [Adamickova] You have a reputation as an advocate 
of a thorough cleansing of the Army of, as you say, the old 
structures. With these views, you often fall out even with 
[Defense] Minister Baudys, whom you certainly do not suspect of 
an affiliation with these people.... 
  [Fejfar] This is a two-tier question. It is true that, on 
the one hand, I am known as a sharp critic of the situation in 
the Army; on the other hand, my colleagues tell me that I am 
father of the soldiers. On the one hand, I claim that we need a 
smaller, strong Army, with which we would be acceptable to NATO, 
and, on the other, I must say that almost nothing has changed in 
the Army over the past three years, and therefore it must be 
cleansed. Nonetheless, I am not so naive to imagine that such a 
cleansing can be done from one day to the next. It is a 
process, and, when I speak of cleansing, I certainly do not mean 
the former communists. They represented 90 percent of the Army. 
  [Adamickova] So, whom do you have in mind? 
  [Fejfar] If I am interested in anyone at all, they are two 
categories: There are the former members of military 
counterespionage, several hundred of whom have remained in the 
Army, which certainly is not right, and the other category is 
the political instructors, albeit not all of them, but, above 
all, the chief indoctrinators, the entire apparatus of the Main 
Political Administration. After all, these people are still 
hiding in the Army, where, I believe, they have no place. They 
are very experienced and able and have their own information 
channels, and that is extremely dangerous. 
  [Adamickova] It seems, however, that Minister Baudys does 
not share your concern when he says that, under his charge, the 
process in the Army started to move and that a lot has changed 
in the command ranks.... 
  [Fejfar] That is a very optimistic view. Of course, it 
happened partially, and there is a certain success in the 
extraordinary assessment of the professional soldiers. 
Nevertheless, some damage caused by this assessment, which 
unnecessarily disgusted normal soldiers, is greater than the 
resulting effect. I believe that it could have been done 
otherwise, but it is done. 
  [Adamickova] How otherwise? 
  [Fejfar] For example, the Army could have parted with these 
people in some way other than by screening. On the other hand, 
I must concede, in defense of the minister, that it is easy to 
talk when we do not bear any responsibility. We are only 
deputies and do not have any powers in this respect. 
  [Adamickova] You have repeatedly voiced a suspicion publicly 
that KGB agents operate within the Czech Army.... 
  [Fejfar] There are some facts, to which I have access, but 
of which I cannot speak. It is a combination of factual 
knowledge combined with a certain suspicion. 
  [Adamickova] It has not been long since Minister Ruml 
reached an agreement with Russian Intelligence Chief Primakov 
that the intelligence services would not work against each 
other. After all, a similar "gentlemen's agreement" was signed 
once by [then] Minister Langos. However, real life demonstrates 
that, in this sphere, it rather is just wishful thinking. What 
do you think? 
  [Fejfar] It would be naive to believe that foreign 
intelligence services, including the Russian one, do not operate 
here. The question is whether they work against us or only 
monitor the situation, whether their interest has shifted to the 
economic sphere. I believe that Russian intelligence 
understands that today we are not its sphere of influence, that 
it is not likely that 1968 will be repeated. Thus, its 
orientation certainly must be changing. In my opinion, certain 
cooperation links must exist, particularly in matters of 
organized crime. I would not object there. The more the 
intelligence services contact one another, the better relations 
will be. In summary: The intelligence services certainly 
operate here, but the question is whether their activities can 
be confined within certain limits. 
  [Adamickova] How would you assess, as a person involved 
primarily in the issues of defense and security policy, the work 
of the Interior Ministry? 
  [Fejfar] I believe that it is far from being as tragic as it 
seem at first sight. Frankly, to put in order such a pigsty as 
the Interior Ministry was, is a tremendously complex task. 
True, an occasional error turns up, but I am convinced that, in 
this situation, it is very understandable. Just remember the 
state of Minister Hradilek as he was leaving the Interior 
Ministry: He was a person on the verge of collapse. Minister 
Sokol approached it somewhat differently, with a smile and 
almost with a tennis racquet in his hand. He trivialized some 
problems and is very clever today and ready to advise what the 
present interior minister is to do. Minister Ruml, as I know 
him, is a truly honest person, and he wants to move things 
forward. I believe that the reason for the occasional scandal 
is the inexperience of some people at the Interior Ministry. If 
I am certain of anything, it is that the Ministry should have 
its peace. I do not mean either that no one is to control it or 
that the papers are not to write about a wrongdoing if it 
occurs. However, constant attacks against its leadership will 
not help the issue. 
  [Adamickova] The Interior Ministry is becoming the target 
of criticism, not only because of the scandals, but especially 
because of the security situation, the solution to which people 
consider the most pressing problem.... 
  [Fejfar] I believe that sometimes it is overdone. The 
hysteria present in society, the feeling that every citizen is 
in danger, is completely unnecessary. If you ask someone 
whether anything happened to him, he usually answers: Just read 
the horrors in the papers. Therefore, I believe that a little 
calming down would not harm. 
  [Adamickova] Of course, only a greater feeling of security 
would help to calm things down.... 
  [Fejfar] Certainly. The situation is being dealt with, as 
we speak. We are stricter even in the legislation. The 
pseudohumanistic period, when the inmates, for instance, lived 
better than other people, is long past. You are well aware of 
the much stricter regulations in several criminal laws. 
  [Adamickova] How do you feel about the expressed opinions 
that the Interior Ministry is controlled by a group of friends 
that has nothing professional about it? 
  [Fejfar] That is difficult. The same arguments can be 
applied to our intelligence service. General Lorenc would 
certainly make a very good chief of counterintelligence because 
what I know about him indicates that he was a perfect 
professional. A changeover took place here, however, new people 
started, and they are learning the job. If you get in such a 
situation, you have two possibilities--either you leave the old 
tested professionals at the Ministry, which is certainly not 
possible, or you depend on friends, whom you trust. If there are 
various scandals at the Interior Ministry, then, I believe it is 
because the new clashes there with the old. It is the same 
problem as in the Army, where, however, no problems are 
mentioned. 
  [Adamickova] Do you know of some? 
  [Fejfar] No, I do not, but I sense that they will begin as 
soon as a radical change takes place there. 
  [Adamickova] At the beginning of February, you took part in 
a meeting in Rome between your committee and its Italian 
Parliament counterpart. Have you considered the possibility of 
using some of their experience in our legal code? 
  [Fejfar] From my point of view, the most interesting part 
was the talks with the Defense Commission and the methods they 
use to monitor or are planning to monitor the Army budget. The 
computer networks of the Defense Ministry and the parliament are 
connected via satellites, and the monitoring is regular and 
topical. This should be our effort and objective. In addition, 
we brought back a lot of material that we will gradually utilize.

  [Text] At the large gathering in Kumanovo, on the occasion 
of the 50th anniversary of forming of the Third Macedonian 
Brigade, President Gligorov stated among other things: "We are 
very much interested in building friendly relations and 
cooperation with all our neighbors, based on neighborly 
cooperation and in the interest of the peace and stability in 
the region. That permanent determination of ours can not be 
threatened by various blockades, political and economic 
pressures, like the recent decision of the Greek Government to 
close its border and its Thessalonike port for our goods. Just 
like before, we firmly stand up to all pressures and will not 
allow any one to deny us the name we have had with centuries. 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
survives and will go on surviving. We have no territorial 
aspirations towards any of our neighbors, and therefore not 
towards our southern one, either. That is why we propose, with 
a clear conscience, to sit down and discuss all the differences 
between our two countries, on an equal basis."

<F P=106> [Interview with Kiro Gligorov, president of The Former </F>
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, by unidentified correspondent; 
place and date not given: "Who Is Worried About Macedonia?"] 
  [Text] In the memoirs of those who, several years ago, 
negotiated on behalf of Europe about the future of the former 
Yugoslavia, one can perceive that a general conviction was that 
Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov was the only reasonable and 
tolerant negotiator of all the former Yugoslav leaders. 
  Because of the stubborn resolve that Macedonia ought to 
observe the interests of other countries as well, Gligorov has 
often been accused by certain circles in Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] of subservience and of 
having an insufficiently patriotic policy. His Balkan neighbors 
also dislike many things about him. Several days ago Athens 
officially accused him of living outside reality, other 
neighbors claim that nothing has been definite and certain about 
Macedonia, certain areas of Macedonian territory are being more 
or less openly claimed, whereas certain scientific symposiums 
are being announced at which the Macedonian issue is supposed to 
be definitely solved. 
  Quite logically, our conversation started with President 
Gligorov commenting on U.S. recognition of Macedonia. 
  [Gligorov] This recognition is undoubtedly very important 
for us, because the United States is the only superpower in the 
world today, and the dominant member of the UN Security Council 
and other international organizations -- both civil and 
military. Until now, all recognitions by the European Union, 
the United Nations, and China were subject to speculation that 
they carry no real weight until the United States recognizes 
Macedonia, that is, that the events in the Balkans might 
possibly evolve in a different direction. This recognition is a 
precondition for us to take part in all future negotiations as a 
subject, given the international recognition of the Macedonian 
entity. You will understand what this means if you look back in 
history, starting from the Balkan wars to the two world wars, 
and see that in all those events the Macedonians were too 
impotent to influence negotiations about the status of 
Macedonia. Now that practice of others making decisions about 
our destiny has ceased. 
  [Correspondent] Does this mean that what follows is only a 
technical part of the recognition of the new position of 
Macedonia? 
  [Gligorov] Now, the admission of Macedonia into the CSCE is 
a very important step. There are no obstacles to this in terms 
of our meeting the conditions for membership. All the reports 
by the relevant bodies, including the CSCE itself, are quite 
positive that Macedonia fulfills all the conditions, and that it 
should be admitted as a full member. Albania opposed the 
proposal for a while, but now it is only Greece that opposes it. 
The essential meaning of admission into the CSCE is entry into 
the system of collective security, whose character is 
predominantly political. CSCE membership would create the 
possibility for us to join the the "Partnership for Peace" 
project. 
  [Correspondent] What does the presence of foreign troops in 
Macedonia mean, not only for Macedonia, but also for the entire 
region? For instance, Milovan Djilas [Serbian dissident] 
recently said in an interview that Macedonia has remained 
Macedonian thanks solely to the arrival of foreign troops. 
  [Gligorov] The history of this issue is as follows: First, 
the arrival of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force]in 
Macedonia was a result of our own initiative. We considered 
that it would be good, with regard to the entire situation in 
the southern Balkans, if preventive, rather than classical, 
peacekeeping forces were deployed in Macedonia. Until they came 
to Macedonia, peacekeeping troops had never prevented armed 
clashes, or contributed to the prevention of such clashes. 
Moreover, until then, the United States had not taken part in 
such actions at all. The UN secretary general became interested 
in that idea, and later on deployed a small contingent of 1,000 
soldiers, without U.S. troops. Troops from the Scandinavian 
countries came first, which we welcomed as a good choice. U.S. 
troops were only deployed later, which means that their presence 
here is not an arbitrary act on the part of the U.S. Government, 
but rather the result of the mandate that was given to them by 
the United Nations. Still, I have to repeat, the novelty is 
only that, until now, the United States has never taken part in 
peacekeeping actions in the region, nor put their troops under 
another command, as in the Macedonian case. In the U.S. Congress 
the issue was seriously discussed and there were many arguments, 
but eventually it was agreed that 300 soldiers in Macedonia 
should be put under the command of the officers appointed by the 
United Nations, serving within UNPROFOR. 
  [Gligorov] I am saying all this just because there are 
frequent remarks and claims that the U.S. forces in Macedonia 
are quite independent and have been deployed in compliance with 
a special agreement. The deeper and more profound reason for 
their presence here, even if it involves only a symbolic 300 
troops, is undoubtedly an expression of the U.S. desire to 
prevent the spreading of the Balkan conflict further south. 
From their point of view, the involvement of Macedonia in the 
conflict would mean a war on the borders of a NATO member 
country, namely Greece. 
  That would entail the danger of involving all Macedonia's 
neighbors in the conflict, that is, other NATO member countries. 
That would have far-reaching consequences for the United States, 
even for its strategic interests. It would be far more 
dangerous than the war in Bosnia, which is still a confined war, 
although it has shaken Europe and influenced many events in the 
world. At least for the time being, provided that the war does 
not spread south, the war in Bosnia has not yet brought about 
the consequences that a conflict on the southern wing of the 
NATO Alliance might cause. 
  The second reason for such a dedicated U.S. engagement lies, 
I think, in the fact that Macedonia shows by its own example 
that it is possible to solve inter-ethnic problems without arms. 
I am not idealizing anything, but we are living proof that 
inter-ethnic tolerance and cooperation is possible. To cut a 
long story short, I think that, although the number of troops 
stationed here is relatively small, their presence carries a 
clear message to anybody that it may concern should the conflict 
spread to Macedonia. It is much more a political than a 
military warning. 
  [Correspondent] At the beginning, the demilitarization of 
Macedonia was quite frequently considered. Why was it abandoned? 
  [Gligorov] Yes, this idea was present, but in the meantime 
we had to do what is necessary, that is, to place our army on 
the borders. After that, it was logical that we demanded 
assistance from the international community, particularly since 
at the time Macedonia was not internationally recognized to the 
extent that it is now. 
  [Correspondent] International observers have been deployed 
along Macedonia's northern and western borders. Recently you 
have stated that one should base one's judgment about Belgrade's 
intentions toward Macedonia on whether Macedonia is recognized 
or not. In that context, how do you view various scenarios for 
the future of Macedonia? 
  [Gligorov] The fact is that war is being waged to the north 
of Macedonia, and that the danger of it spreading exists. There 
is also the problem of Kosovo. Still, regardless of all that, I 
do not think that Macedonia is directly endangered by Serbia. 
However, as long as the war goes on, and as long as the problem 
of Kosovo is unsettled, potential danger will always exist. 
  Precisely because of all this, I am convinced that such 
dangers would be diminished, or removed, by the mutual 
recognition of the FRY and Macedonia. 
  [Correspondent] Has there been any initiative in that 
respect on your part? 
  [Gligorov] I encouraged that idea in an interview, and I 
particularly discussed it with President Milosevic during our 
meeting in Ohrid last year. I pointed out that mutual 
recognition is necessary for many reasons, and since there is no 
conflict between Macedonia and Serbia or any territorial claims 
on either side -- at least none has ever been officially stated 
-- there are no major obstacles for our two countries to 
recognize each other, while it is a completely different matter 
what ideas and forces exist. Finally, the fact is that the 
former Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] agreed to withdraw, and 
there were no incidents while it was withdrawing. 
  In view of all this, and in view of the general mood in 
Macedonia, and I believe in Serbia as well, I think that mutual 
recognition would be welcomed. I underlined even earlier that 
two things are very important for relations between Macedonia 
and Serbia: Serbia's recognition of Macedonia and the 
Macedonian people in 1944, and the agreed withdrawal of the JNA 
from Macedonia. Both imply mutual recognition as a logical 
consequence, and the beginning of the development of mutual 
relations in all fields. On the other hand, I think that 
recognizing Macedonia would be very advantageous for the FRY, 
because it would eliminate any suspicion that the conflict might 
spread to the south, that is, that the FRY has some hidden 
interests, which are now mentioned only in certain speculation 
about the future course of events in the Balkans. Then the 
problem of Kosovo would show itself in a completely different 
light, as a problem that is an affair of the FRY in the first 
place. Because, as long as there are fears that the war might 
spread to the south, speculations about some pan-Albanian 
settlement for the region will exist. In fact, that settlement 
sustains the forces in other former Yugoslav republics that 
support the establishment of greater nation states. In that 
respect, Macedonia has been an exception, because since the very 
beginning we have publicly maintained that the Macedonian state 
is possible only within its current borders. Everything else is 
an adventure and a disaster. 
  [Correspondent] The reaction of Greek Prime Minister 
Papandreou to the news of U.S. recognition of Macedonia was to 
accuse you of living out of reality, or rather, of being unable 
to comprehend all the possible consequences. How do you see 
your future relations with Greece? 
  [Gligorov] I view them only in terms of negotiations, 
regardless of whether those negotiations deal with our relations 
in general, or with what has been happening these days, while it 
is precisely such daily platforms that we have been witnessing 
that reveal where a different attitude on our part would lead. 
We have plenty of good will, we are ready to discuss any 
subject, and I think that the initial mistake was made precisely 
because we failed to follow this course. Our attitude will 
prove that many things that appear to be complex are, in fact, 
easy to solve. For instance, it is ridiculous to maintain that 
Macedonia has any pretensions to any Greek territory. The 
Greeks are constantly demanding guarantees from us on the 
unchangeability of the borders, while we are constantly 
repeating, parrot fashion, to them that the borders are 
definite. We have proposed a bilateral agreement on this, and 
if necessary we are even ready to sign it at any time, even with 
guarantees by the European Community [EC], or the United Nations. 
  The Greek path to Europe leads through Macedonia, while our 
path to the rest of the world leads through Greece, not to 
mention other mutual interests. Why should we disregard our 
mutual interests, and keep up the current conflicts that are in 
many ways imaginary, emotional, and encumbered with certain 
interpretations of the historical heritage on both sides? 
  In our approach I see the reality of Macedonian policy. 
Besides, I think that the character of that policy can also be 
seen in the fact that the Macedonian people have never 
instigated hatred toward any people. Since the very beginning 
we have emphasized that we want good relations with all our 
neighbors, and also an improvement rather than a breakup of 
those relations in all fields. As for Greece, just remember 
that it is not the Macedonians who introduced the embargo or 
closed the borders. 
  [Correspondent] Macedonia was an underdeveloped country, the 
least viable of all the former Yugoslav republics, but still you 
have paid off all your debts to the international creditors, 
which has opened the door to your full membership of the IMF and 
to new loans. What is the current policy here, and what is the 
strategic policy of Macedonia? 
  [Gligorov] I am convinced that Macedonia must base its 
position on a final orientation to the market economy. All 
small countries, of which we are one, as well as all the Balkan 
states, must opt for open national economies if they want to 
prosper. 
  It is difficult to stick to that course without foreign 
financial aid, and therefore all our forces have been 
concentrated on how to eliminate the obstacles that had resulted 
from the unsettled international status of Macedonia. We 
managed to bring missions from international financial 
institutions to Macedonia even before we settled our status in 
those institutions. Thanks to this, a whole series of 
preparatory measures were completed, while certain projects were 
not taken into full consideration for formal reasons. Finally, 
we were not able to pay off the debts that we inherited from 
former Yugoslavia, as the regular method of indemnification 
would have delayed some other economic steps that we were 
planning, so we asked the creditors for understanding, and we 
did meet with understanding in terms of how to pay off our $100 
million debt: The governments of certain countries first helped 
us, then the International Development Agency helped us with a 
loan under very favorable conditions, while the remaining $25 
million was indemnified by the Soros Foundation, which also gave 
us a short-term loan under favorable conditions. 
  [Correspondent] We presume that you held the same attitude 
even at the time of the talks between the six presidents of the 
republics of former Yugoslavia. What was the reason for your 
failure to bring the other participants to their senses? 
  [Gligorov] That depended also on the will of all the 
participants, and no solution could possibly have been imposed. 
I think that a very important opportunity was missed at that 
time, one that some people underestimated, while others saw it 
as a trap. I am referring to the offer by the EC that 
Yugoslavia would be admitted to the EC as an associate member, 
if a peaceful solution to the crisis was found. The offer also 
anticipated $4.5 billion for a positive answer. However, there 
was either no readiness to accept the offer, or there was a lack 
of trust in it, or the choice had already been made in favor of 
the solutions that later brought about clashes. I still believe 
that a great opportunity was missed, one that would have enabled 
all of us to avoid everything that followed thereafter in the 
region. 
  [Correspondent] A Russian political delegation and a U.S. 
military delegation were in Skopje yesterday. Do you feel that 
you have been under pressure by both sides? 
  [Gligorov] Neither of those visits was intended to exert 
pressure on me. We talked with President Yeltsin's envoy 
Churkin primarily about future diplomatic and other relations, 
and particularly about economic cooperation between our two 
countries, something in which we are very interested. Second, 
Moscow is very much involved in finding a solution to the 
Bosnian crisis, and that was an opportunity to brief us on 
everything that has to do with the direct Russian involvement. 
We also wanted to learn more about some broader elements of 
Russian policy, its main principles, and what we can expect from 
it. Which is to say, it was a meeting of the representatives of 
two friendly countries, and it was a good opportunity for both 
delegations to become better informed and to make agreements on 
more dynamic cooperation, particularly in the field of economics. 
  The arrival of the U.S. Army delegation had to do primarily 
with a visit to the U.S. contingent. There were absolutely no 
pressures or demands to increase the number of their soldiers 
here, which is the subject of a lot of public speculation. It 
is always forgotten that the U.S. troops are part of UNPROFOR, 
while neither earlier nor now have there been bilateral demands 
that their troops be stationed in Macedonia. The story about 
Macedonia being a U.S. aircraft carrier on the ground is not 
realistic for serious reasons and also for banal ones, since our 
airport is hardly able to respond to the needs of civilian air 
traffic. Still, in view of the times that we are living in, I 
can understand all sorts of exaggerations and combinations, 
although they have nothing to do with reality; I understand all 
those who are constantly discovering what lies behind this or 
that. 
  [Correspondent] The reason for such calculations is that the 
retailoring of the political map of the Balkans is in progress. 
  [Gligorov] Macedonia has undoubtedly chosen the European 
option, but at the same time the presence of Russia is quite 
legitimate in the region. That is the reality, but in my 
opinion, the reality is also the ever greater interest of Russia 
in cooperation with Europe, the United States, and the entire 
world. There is no reason for such a partnership not to be 
present in the Balkans. There is no justification for sticking 
to the old formula that it is either Russia or the United States 
that dominates the region. All countries are interested in 
their own presence in the Balkans, and you can see that Japan is 
also setting its foot here -- not only because it wants to 
confirm its economic power in global diplomacy as well, but also 
because there are increasingly fewer regions in the world that 
are attractive for international capital. In that respect the 
Balkans is attractive for anybody. I think that the time of 
looking at the Balkans through the prism of the Cold War and the 
division of the world into two superpowers is definitely over. 
Obviously, this is not particularly clear to everybody these 
days, but the sooner one understands that, the fewer traumas 
there will be and the more easily eliminated. 
<H5>  [Box, page 12] </H5>
  [Correspondent] Because of the war and the international 
blockade of the FRY, the traffic on Morava and Vardar Rivers has 
almost died out. In the meantime, you have taken part in the 
opening of the road and railroad link Sofia-Skopje-Tirana-Drac. 
How far has the project gone, and what impact will it have on 
the old route? 
  [Gligorov] This West-East route neither replaces nor is 
supposed to diminish the importance of the old North-South 
route. For Macedonia and Greece that is the shortest way to 
Europe, as well as for Serbia to the south, and its value will 
be fully restored when the war ends. Still, why should we not 
make such a East-West link? Albania was isolated for a long 
time, whereas connections with Albania are an objective economic 
necessity for Macedonia. The current connections are almost 
vitally important. In addition, the exchange and communications 
with Bulgaria were quite limited. Macedonia is situated in the 
middle of the southern Balkans, has no direct access to the sea, 
while those two routes intersect in Macedonia. Hence the chance 
for a more rapid development of Macedonia. You see that the 
international community, in particular the European Union, is 
interested in developing the possibilities of those two 
connections. 
<H5>  [Box, page 13] </H5>
  [Correspondent] The fears that the deadline given to the 
Bosnian Serbs by NATO might entangle Macedonia in some troubles 
are quite widespread. What do you think? 
  [Gligorov] These are certainly overreactions, but I think 
that the rapid deterioration of the conflict has raised the 
temperature not only in Macedonia, but also throughout the 
Balkans. Just look at the reactions from Albania, Bulgaria, and 
other countries. One has to take these into consideration, but 
let us hope that in the meantime reason will prevail, and that 
the negotiations on heavy weapons will start.

  [Text] As of 0800 tomorrow, one soldier of the Serbian 
army of Krajina and one member of the ministry of internal 
affairs of the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] together with 
the members of the Nepalese Battalion of the UN Protection 
Forces [UNPROFOR] will control the crossing of the RSK state 
border on the Bridge of Serbian Unity. 
  This is a result of an agreement between [UNPROFOR] General 
Jean Cot and General Milan Celeketic, reached today on the 
bridge itself. They also discussed other similar locations in 
the RSK; however, the details were left to future negotiations. 
  According to General Jean Cot, the entire situation 
concerning the bridge should not have reached the dimensions it 
did. All future disputes will be resolved through talks. It is 
not the first time that I have talked with General Celeketic. 
Knowing him, I am sure that all misunderstandings will be 
resolved through negotiation.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Frane Plancic: "One NATO -- Two Bosses"] </F>
  [Text] It might seem absurd at first sight that the NATO 
ultimatum for Bosnia can be carried out only if V. Churkin 
replaces M. Woerner as the secretary general of this military 
alliance. In fact, Churkin should already be recognized in his 
acquired status of NATO secretary general. If he were secretary 
general, everything would go smoothly, as in these days! There 
would be no quarrels. Even the large intelligence scandal which 
broke out when a Russian agent was found in the CIA leadership 
would be resolved in a quiet and civilized way. 
  If Churkin were NATO secretary general, it is certain that 
he 
would be able to reach the same attitude of all NATO members 
toward the aggression against civilians and UN Protection Force 
members as is the case with the present secretary general. He 
would also withdraw in the same realistic way as Woerner did 
when the time came for firing on the aggressor in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. And in Croatia? Since nobody mentioned 
Croatia in the ultimatum, Croatia can only be a topic for an 
academic discussion. 
  Let me summarize: Nobody would notice any external 
manifestation of absurdity in Churkin's leading NATO. It is 
possible that somebody notices certain internal manifestations 
of it at the moment when every member of the alliance expresses 
its aims openly. France and Britain have stopped NATO actions 
hundreds of times so far, so that Russia, the main post-Cold War 
ally --as this is expressed in Washington -- should be given 
this possibility, too. 
<H5>  Simulating the Ultimatum </H5>
  This time the Russian counterultimatum was respected; NATO 
gave up announced air strikes in the name of the strategy of 
political negotiations. The efforts for peace allegedly rose 
after the military threat had been expressed to both Bosnian 
Serbs and Belgrade. 
  So, let us see how Serbs are coping with these negotiations. 
  They are threatening with both weapons and words. Everybody 
who hoped that something else would happen is a "first-class" 
political dilettante. 
  Belgrade, which should have been shaken by the NATO threats, 
is still self-confidently stating that it will not approve of 
opening of the Tuzla Airport, neither for peace nor for war 
purposes. NATO has issued an ultimatum that the airport must be 
opened on 7 March. We shall see how NATO will respond to the 
latest refusal from Belgrade, but we can already be sure that 
NATO's reaction will be of the Churkin type. 
  The Churkin-type reaction has already been seen in a more 
dangerous incident than the possible one with the Tuzla Airport 
-- when Chetniks occupied the Sava Bridge between Stara Gradiska 
and Bosanska Gradiska. The local UN Protection Force (allegedly 
protected by the NATO ultimatum) were humiliated and expelled 
from their positions, their houses for monitoring were 
destroyed.... Approximately 20 Serbian tanks and armored 
vehicles (withdrawn from Sarajevo?) came so close that they can 
cross the Croatian border at any time (that is to say the 
occupied territory, but still a part of Croatia according to 
what NATO, the UN, and all others say). At the request of the 
UN Protection Force NATO aircraft are now flying over this 
territory and simulating the ultimatum. They are simulating it 
in the real sense of the word since Croatia is not mentioned in 
the text of the ultimatum, so that it cannot be included in its 
Churkin- type implementation. 
  An act of simulation was also made the day before yesterday 
in response to a Serbian artillery attack on Swedish UN 
Protection Force members near Vares. 
  NATO aircraft arrived in the area in which five Swedish 
soldiers were wounded and concluded that it could not be 
established who fired. Since they had a clear conscience they 
returned home, leaving the possibility open that either Serbs or 
Muslims could have fired -- or perhaps the Swedish soldiers 
themselves -- just as it was imputed to Muslims that they shot 
at the people in the Sarajevo market. 
  If NATO aircraft were flying over Maslenica, Kasic, Paljuv, 
or Peruca in these days, they would not be able to see who is 
shooting there either. They would return home peacefully, 
leaving the possibility open that the Croatian Army was shooting 
at its own positions. As if it were not known that it was the 
Croatian president himself who ordered the attack on the 
presidential palace in Zagreb during the war in Croatia! 
<H5>  Serbs Are Going On With Incidents </H5>
  Churkin, as the acting NATO secretary general, could be 
confronted with unpleasant situations, though -- like the one 
when a Serbian officer was caught by cameras in an action which 
violated the ultimatum (if there is something like that at all). 
The incident happened two days ago [22 February] in front of 
CBS cameras at the place where Serbian artillery weapons were 
being collected under the supervision of the British UN 
Protection Force. A Serbian officer came there with a truck, 
took one of the collected guns (a mountain gun, of the B-1 
type), attached it to the truck, and drove away in front of UN 
monitors. He was stopped by British UN Protection Force 
soldiers at the exit, though (they are professionals, and, apart 
from that, cameras were there). General Rose, the UN Protection 
Force commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, was called, and he 
ordered his soldiers to return the gun to the marked area. A 
British officer said that there were still five or six Serbian 
guns on the surrounding hills. Nobody attacked them from the 
air, and we do not know anything about them. 
  Such incidents and serious attacks by Serbian artillery are 
going on in the area between Bihac and Tuzla, from Maslenica to 
Gradiska. This means that the whole territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and parts of Croatia are affected. What can 
be concluded from this? 
  It is quite obvious that the NATO ultimatum has not taken 
effect. That is why there are no political negotiations which 
should have followed from it. Churkin's engagement and 
enumeration of Serbian incidents are the only two things which 
have been noticed so far. Churkin and the Serbs are both led by 
the idea to undermine a NATO intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  It could be easily predicted that this idea would be carried 
out in this way. It is being openly carried out in the occupied 
Croatian territories and in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Encouraged by 
the success of the Russian counter-ultimatum, Serbs are going on 
with incidents in all occupied territories (which are too large 
for a concentrated NATO action) using small weapons (a too cheap 
goal for setting the whole NATO machinery in motion) and 
selecting those targets which are not directly mentioned in the 
ultimatum (so that NATO does not have the "legal" basis for an 
action).... 
  Their aim is evident -- to preserve as much occupied 
territories as possible though unsanctioned military actions. 
They have enough time and military power to do this. Apart 
from that, they have the political blessing from Russia which 
claims that it will not allow any further ultimatums for Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hrvoje Kacic, head of the State Commission </F>
for Borders, by Vado Rajic; place and date not given: "The 
Sovereignty of Croatia Must Not Be Jeopardized"] 
  [Text] Just a couple of days after Croatia and Slovenia 
signed a package of intergovernmental agreements, a mixed 
commission for borders met in Bled. Is there any symbolism in 
that, considering the complexity of Croat-Slovene relations? 
For, until now, those border conflicts were presented as the 
cause of strained or tense relations between the two countries. 
The new head of the Croatian delegation in that 
intergovernmental body, Hrvoje Kacic, talked to VJESNIK about 
the reverberations and effects of the Bled meeting. 
  [Kacic] First of all, one can get the impression that we are 
starting from zero in state-border matters as well. That is 
only partly true. Indeed, the work of the commission was 
interrupted and the break was unnecessarily long. The Croatian 
side of that body has, in the meantime, changed quite a lot. I 
succeeded Davorin Rudolf almost three months after he stopped 
leading the Croatian delegation, because of other obligations. 
There are other new members of the delegation. Introducing new 
participants to the achieved level of the negotiations took 
time. Expert groups did much to help that introduction and, 
relying upon cartographic data, they did much of the work. Out 
of 252 cartographic charts, the data were precisely determined 
in 206 of those zones, so as not to open any other additional 
questions that would have to be discussed at a political level. 
Even in the remaining 46 cartographic zones, it is possible to 
determine the mutual border without difficulty in most cases. 
However, in some areas, experts will not be able to solve all 
the open questions alone. Diplomatic commissions will take up 
the work that the experts are not able to. 
<H5>  Facts and Consequences </H5>
  [Rajic] The impression that you are starting from zero was 
also supported by the content of the Bled meeting, where rules 
of procedure of the mixed commission was the only item on the 
agenda. 
  [Kacic] Rules of procedure are a technical aid in our work. 
The effectiveness of our future work depends on determined rules 
of procedure. Your remark is correct in that the basic 
principle of rules of procedure is consensus, that is, the 
agreement of both delegations on every question. Consequently, 
we will have to invest a lot of time and effort to coordinate 
mutual interests and views. Internal and foreign affairs 
experts, geodesists, and experts on international public law are 
entrusted with determining the facts. Parliament has the final 
say. From the level of experts and the diplomatic commission to 
parliament, there are many extremely important participants in 
that work. The foreign minister, the prime minister, the 
government in its entirety, and even the president of the 
republic will definitely participate in solving open questions 
that cannot be agreed on the level of mixed commission, that is, 
its diplomatic part. 
  [Rajic] Is it true that, at the press conference held during 
the break of the Bled meeting, one could see differences with 
regard to principles on which the two sides intended to work in 
establishing their joint border? The Croatian side advocated a 
mixed principle of various criteria for establishing the border, 
while the Slovene side insisted on the data which contain 
geodesic charts of areas of the joint Slovene-Croat border. 
  [Kacic] Such an interpretation, even showing the alleged 
conflict of principles, is a simplification of what has been 
done in the commission. After all, we did resume work, which 
already disproves the hypothesis that there was a conflict about 
principles. I have mentioned information that makes it obvious 
that a good part of the job was done. Furthermore, recent 
statements of [Prime Ministers] Valentic and Drnovsek, though 
made at the declarative level, contain the principles in 
question. All this shows that the two sides are gradually 
getting closer. The impression of the press, on the other hand, 
advocates the absolutization of just one principle and becoming 
a slave to it, which I am convinced would never produce a good 
or final result. For our task is not only to establish the 
facts but also to predict the consequences, should any of the 
principles be applied to every single open question. Therefore, 
giving the principles a special status is out of the question, 
for we must still establish the facts, whose content will 
reconcile the represented principles. 

<H5>    Without Conflicts Only With Hungary </H5>
  [Rajic] Speaking about impressions, here is another one: Is 
it true that the outcome of negotiations on the state border in 
the Bay of Piran will determine the outcome of the entire border 
problem between Croatia and Slovenia? 
  [Kacic] The Bay of Piran is undoubtedly one of the main 
points of these negotiations. It is also true that this is the 
main bone of contention in the present work regarding borders. 
However, in order to solve that question, we must finish the 
work on the land border and say where it comes out, at which 
point, to the Bay of Piran. I think we should proceed as 
follows: We must first solve the question of who controls the 
Bay of Piran. It is not an ambition of Croatia to change the 
name of the bay, but the name itself says that is an area in 
which the Slovene interest is more intensively present. 
Moreover, I do not believe that, in addition to Croatian 
maritime resources in, for example Limski Kanal, Croatia has any 
interest for the shells in the Bay of Piran itself. 
  However, one advantage of the Slovene negotiating team has 
hitherto escaped our notice. Slovenia borders four countries: 
Italy, Austria, Hungary, and Croatia. It does not have any 
border disputes with the first three countries, so it seems that 
it has a problem only with "the bad guys from Croatia," for 
border conflicts exist there. Croatia, on the other hand, has 
no border conflict only with Hungary. With regard to all other 
borders, from Slovenia to Serbia, from Bosnia to Montenegro, 
Croatia will have to put much effort into solving all the 
problems and settling the border disputes. 
  Furthermore, one must have some understanding for the 
Slovene 
side, which used to have the right of tramp navigation to the 
open sea from its part of the coast. According to the 
government that became effective after Croatia and Slovenia 
gained independence, the territorial waters of Croatia and Italy 
were connected, because of the configuration of the area and the 
proximity of the Italian and Croatian coasts. Naturally, that 
imposes certain limitations. The quality of navigation for 
ports in the Slovensko Primorje [Slovene Riviera], according to 
the valid norms of the Convention on the Law of the Sea, grants 
the so-called right of inoffensive way, and that is different 
from the regime of tramp navigation. Those who are responsible 
for solving that problem must find a solution that would not 
make our Slovene neighbors claustrophobic. I do not think that 
is in the interest of Croatia either. But the sovereignty of 
Croatia on its territory must not be jeopardized. 
  [Rajic] In that context, what does the demand for preserving 
the integrity of the Bay of Piran mean? 
  [Kacic] In my opinion, it is significant as being a future 
solution that will be established by determining all the 
elements of Slovene and Croat interests, which will be our 
connecting point. For, the Bay of Piran and the choice of 
solutions acceptable to both sides puts both Croatia and 
Slovenia to the test, testing their maturity and readiness to 
become part of Europe. I, therefore, do not accept that even 
now, before ending the discussion, we should refer to final 
solutions as if it were really not possible to reach an 
agreement. 
<H5>  Arbitration Is Unacceptable </H5>
  [Rajic] Do you also think arbitration is one of the final 
solutions? 
  [Kacic] I think it is pointless to talk about arbitration at 
this stage, although it was mentioned long ago in the work of 
this commission. As far as I have grasped the content of open 
questions in mutual demarcation, I understand that asking 
someone else to settle our dispute would prove the lack of 
maturity of one or the other, or both countries, and their 
inability to evaluate all the relevant circumstances of this 
sensitive matter. 
  [Rajic] To what extent does a positive political 
atmosphere in relations between the two countries influence the 
work of the border commission? 
  [Kacic] That is a great help in this stage of our work. Our 
commission is not only the first joint body to convene after the 
Valentic-Drnovsek package, but we also scheduled another meeting 
"somewhere in Croatia" for 17 and 18 March. Both the Croatian 
and the Slovene side refused to solve problems by postponing 
them. Especially as, in those "postponed circumstances," we run 
the risk of possible incidents, even verbal incidents with 
regard to where our border begins and where their border ends. 
I can laugh at, become sad about, or get furious about the 
expression "Alpine Croats," with which our Slovene neighbors 
sometimes treat themselves, having a clearly defined goal in 
mind. The same reaction is possible regarding the expression 
"Slovene Istria," as a replacement for the hitherto common terms 
for Slovensko Primorje, Slovene Riviera, and so on. How to 
react to "Slovene Istria"? By mentioning Hrvatine ["Hrvat" means 
Croat], the first village that one passes through after entering 
Slovenia from Italy? Will either side be trying to gain some 
advantage on that level? 
  [Rajic] Is the fact that you were appointed head of the 
Croatian negotiating delegation and head of the State Commission 
for Borders, which is attributed to your political "color," on 
that level too, and has the fact that you are actually an expert 
with years of experience, that you have many academic degrees in 
that field, been neglected? 
  [Kacic] Yes, it is something like that, for one is 
speculating about my status as an independent candidate at the 
first elections, my status as a deputy, some alleged offers for 
state functions and the like. It is all partly true, but the 
other part makes it relative. For example, as an independent 
candidate in Dubrovnik, at that time I would not have succeeded 
without the support of both the Croatian Democratic Community 
and other, then opposition, parties. 
  Regarding my expertise, let me tell you this. My entire 
professional career has been dedicated to maritime law, but 
mostly in the domain of commercial relations. What I am 
entrusted with in this case obliges me to study the problem 
thoroughly. Therefore, it is not something I could use to 
praise myself.

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Komadina: "Marriage of All Serbian Spies </F>
in Plitvice"] 
  [Text] As Zeljko Simic, vice chairman of the government of 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was explaining at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Zagreb to numerous journalists 
that Croatia and Serbia (Yugoslavia) would come closer, a 
meeting of far more concrete intentions was being held 
approximately 70 km southwards -- probably as a proof of the 
Serbian sincerity. In the national park of Plitvice, which was 
occupied and devastated by the Serbs, an agreement on joint 
activities of the intelligence and counterintelligence services 
of "all Serbian countries" was signed. Translated into normal 
language, this means that intelligence services from the 
Serb-occupied regions in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina are now 
connected with their principals in Yugoslavia. According to this 
agreement the joint intelligence service would have four 
divisions: for foreign contacts, for analysis and research, the 
operative division, and the external security division. The 
headquarters will be in Pancevo, which was in the former 
Yugoslavia known as the center for education of intelligence 
officers. There will be "branch offices" in Banja Luka, Pale, 
Knin, and Petrinja. The so-called "branch offices" will consist 
of groups of about 12 officers: a commander, a coordinator, and 
an adviser for artillery, infantry, and air force. Each of the 
"branch offices" will be led by a coordinator, whose task will 
be to cooperate with the "headquarters." There will also be a 
joint coordinator who will at the same time be the leader of the 
intelligence services of the "Srpska republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina" and of the "republic of Serbian Krajina." 
Bosko Kelecevic obtained the position of coordinator in 
Croatia. Only several days before the meeting in Plitvice the 
representatives of SVR, the newly established Russian 
intelligence service, allegedly visited Knin. According to the 
protocol about joint activities between the intelligence 
services, it was decided to reorganize the intelligence service 
in order to "efficiently achieve short-term and long-term 
strategic and safety interests as well as the internal and 
external security." The agreement was signed in the presence of 
General Aleksandar Dimitrijevic, the head of the military 
intelligence service of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and 
Radenko Radinovic, his assistant for the counterintelligence 
service. Generals Bosko Kelecevic, Milan Gvero, and Milisav 
Gagovic also participated in the meeting. 
  This event, about which some Belgrade and Slovene (!) 
newspapers published short reports, means that the 
reorganization of the Belgrade intelligence services, which have 
been shaken by many scandals and internal conflicts between 
Yugoslav and Serbian officers, has been completed. The victory 
of the "hard" line is confirmed by the fact that General Bosko 
Kelecevic has been appointed head, in other words the "main 
intelligence service coordinator" between the so-called "Srpska 
republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina" and "Serbian Krajina." 
<H5>  Kelecevic Moved to Slunj </H5>
  The newly established "boss" of all Serbian spies, Mr. Bosko 
Kelecevic was born 42 years ago in Bosanski Aleksandrovac, a 
small place between Banja Luka and Bosanska Gradiska. After 
having completed the education for noncommissioned officers, he 
continued his education at the Military Academy in Belgrade. He 
specialized in artillery. He spent the major part of his 
military training in Krizevci, Croatia. He is married to a 
Croatian national and has twin sons. In 1971 he entered KOS, 
the intelligence service of the former Yugoslav People's Army 
(this is the abbreviation, but the full name of the service was 
The Security Department of the Federal Ministry of National 
Defense). He became the head of the Security Department in the 
Fifth Military Region in 1987. His activity covered Slovenia 
and almost all of Croatia. At the beginning of the aggression 
against Croatia he participated in numerous negotiations with 
Croatian authorities. Together with the majority of the 
commanders in the Fifth Military Region he moved with his family 
from Zagreb to Slunj in May 1991. His boss, General Zivota 
Avramovic, joined him there somewhat later. He performed the 
same tasks in Slunj. In October 1991 he moved to Mrakovica, on 
the Kozara Mountain, and then to Sarajevo at the end of 1991. 
In Sarajevo he joined the Second Military Region led by the 
notorious General Kukanjac. At the time when the army of 
Bosnian Serbs was being formed, in April and May of 1992, he was 
appointed chief of staff of the First Krajina Corps, which was 
led by Momir Talic. The corps was situated in Banja Luka. He 
was promoted to the general rank. 
<H5>  Boss -- A Typical Noncommissioned Officer </H5>
  Those who met Bosko Kelecevic during his service in Zagreb 
say that he is a typical noncommissioned officer, a man 
thoroughly loyal to and indoctrinated by the ideas of his 
superiors. The word of his superiors has the power of law for 
him. His activities in the war against Croatia are vague. He 
did not distinguish himself anywhere except in the region of 
Bosanska Posavina, where he fought for the preservation of the 
corridor there under the command of Talic and Lisica. People 
who know him well say that he is a better artillery man than an 
intelligence officer. They claim that he substitutes a lack of 
intelligence skills by his excellent feeling for organization 
and exceptional energy. His greatest success in the 
intelligence war in Croatia is considered the development of a 
widely spread network of intelligence officers. He infiltrated 
them by issuing journalists' cards for them, a well-known 
method. Although he has not gone through all necessary stages in 
the training of intelligence officers, his promotion was very 
quick. This is explained by his good connections to the former 
first man of KOS, Mr. Aleksandar Vasiljevic. 
  The information from the meeting in Plitvice is opening a 
new chapter of questions about the intelligence war waged in 
occupied Croatian territories. Three intelligence organizations 
from Belgrade are active in the occupied Croatian territories: 
The Intelligence Service of the Army of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia General Staff, the Department of the State Security 
of the Army, and the Department of State Security of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of Serbia. Well-trained officers 
work in these organizations, they have a long tradition and are 
well equipped. Some of the officers are distinguished 
professionals, such as Radenko Radinovic and Mr. Dimitrijevic, 
who learned their profession through all the stages of education 
at the Security Department. In the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
of Serbia there are professionals such as Jovica Stanisic, the 
head of this service, and Franko Simatovic-Frenki, the officer 
in charge of connection with the occupied territories in 
Croatia. Their main task is to decode the Croatian Army 
movements and to collect data necessary for taking actions. 
<H5>  Work Among Muslims </H5>
  The fact that Serbian intelligence officers became united -- 
regardless of how dangerous this might seem at first sight -- is 
nothing new. The main "coordinator" is still situated in 
Belgrade, so that the alleged conflicts among the local bosses 
in the occupied Croatian territories are in fact only a tactic 
of the Belgrade intelligence services, which still have full 
control of the so-called Krajina. In the last two years, during 
the war between Croatian and Serbian intelligence officers, 
there have been many struggles which mostly resulted in Croatian 
victories. The final outcome will, however, depend on who has 
the larger number of professionals and better organization and 
equipment. The greatest Serbian success is considered the 
infiltration of Serbian intelligence officers into Muslim 
circles who allegedly contributed to the war between Bosnian 
Muslims and Croats. 
  There is the impression, however, that the formal merger of 
all Serbian intelligence services primarily has political rather 
than professional, "spying" functions. After this merger, there 
followed the monetary union. According to some information the 
armies of "all Serbian countries" should become united in March 
1995. Is not this yet another proof of Serbian sincerity when 
it speaks about the normalization of relations between Croatia 
and Serbia?

<F P=106> ["Pool" item by Stevan Cordas] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 28 (TANJUG) -- Diplomats in Belgrade 
are sceptical on Monday of the chance of Bosnian Moslems and 
Croats reaching agreement at their talks in Washington to form a 
union and then a confederation with neighbouring Croatia, 
feeling that any idea imposed from outside is rather difficult 
of concretisation. The United States, on the other hand, is 
confident that the plan is ideal and that it has finally hit 
upon a simple solution for Bosnia. 
  The latest analyses made in Zagreb, however, seem to 
indicate 
that the U.S. solution is far from being simple. Zagreb's 
acceeding in the U.S. plan is being seen as a Croatian effort to 
get out from under U.N. pressure. Furthermore, diplomats in 
Belgrade point out, any solution devised at the expense of a 
third side -- in this case, Bosnian Serbs -- is bound to fail. 
  This view is shared by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav 
Jovanovic, who believes that the U.S. plan is acceptable only if 
it has no ulterior motive other than lasting peace in Bosnia. 
  The Washington talks are interesting also from another 
aspect 
-- that of the United States' former support for Bosnian 
Moslems. Washington's idea to unite the Moslems and Croats 
denotes its reluctance to permit the creation of an Islamic 
state in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Any future U.S. support for 
the Moslems must be regarded only in the context of their 
unification with the Croats, it is being heard in Belgrade. 
  In any case, one thing is clear -- both the Moslems and the 
Croats have an interest at this time in falling in with the U.S. 
plan. However, during the two years of war, the two sides have 
signed and then ignored a host of different agreements, always 
running true to form of saying one thing, doing another and 
plotting a third.

<F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F>
Udo van Kampen in Brussels -- live] 
  [Text] [Van Kampen] Mr. Woerner, thank you very much for 
coming to this live cast. My first question to you: Why did 
these attacks take place just now? 
  [Woerner] That is quite simple: This was the first 
violation of the no-fly zone by area planes [Flaechenflugzeuge], 
which we have noticed throughout the year that have been 
carrying out this operation. We announced that we would act, or 
rather had to act, after we had issued warnings because we want 
this no-fly zone to be respected. In addition, our pilots were 
able to notice that these combat planes were in the process of 
dropping bombs -- that is, fighting against targets on the 
ground. 
  [Van Kampen] Is there not the danger that the conflict will 
escalate now? 
  [Woerner] I think the opposite will happen. One will learn 
to take NATO seriously, and one will learn to respect the no-fly 
zone and also to take other UN resolutions seriously, too. That 
means, I rather suspect, that the entire matter will lead to a 
calming down of the situation than to the opposite. 
  [Van Kampen] What happens if the Serbs retaliate? There are 
already reports that towns like Tuzla, for instance, are being 
attacked more intensively now. 
  [Woerner] I think there is no connection between the two 
events. Tuzla has been attacked repeatedly in the past few 
days. In addition, so far none of the three parties has claimed 
the planes. It would be very strange behavior if they were to 
retaliate. I do not think that this is going to happen because 
the entire matter is an operation that is fully covered by the 
United Nations. As I have heard, even the Russians have rather 
supported this action. 
  [Van Kampen] Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary General.

<F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F>
Udo van Kampen in Brussels on 28 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Van Kampen] Would you say that today's combat 
action was a turning point in NATO's history? 
  [Woerner] In NATO's history -- yes, of course. It was the 
very first combat action. In addition, it was a combat action 
not to defend one's own territory against a threat but, if you 
like, out-of-area -- that is, beyond our normal alliance 
territory. However, this operation has nothing to do -- at least 
not directly -- with the other tasks that we have set ourselves 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is an operation to enforce the 
no-fly zone. 
  Apart from that, there are other operations --for example, 
to 
enforce this exclusion zone [Ausschlusszone] -- and I think that 
one should beware of general judgments. In any case, it makes 
it clear that NATO is now confronted with a completely new task, 
which it is fulfilling successfully: crisis management and the 
enforcement of UN peacemaking measures.

<F P=106> [By Olivier Baube] </F>
  [Excerpt] Naples, Italy, Feb 28 (AFP) -- U.S. warplanes 
shot down four Bosnian Serb planes attacking Moslem positions in 
Bosnia early Monday, marking the first such NATO military 
intervention in the two-year Bosnian war. 
  "We did what we said we would do," said Admiral James 
Boorda, 
the commander of the allied forces southern Europe command, who 
authorised the downing of the four Super Galeb Bosnian Serb 
planes over central Bosnia at 0548 GMT. "If it was a test, I 
think we passed the quiz." 
  Boorda said the Serb aircraft were shot down shortly after 
NATO warplanes on a reconnaissance mission detected them 
carrying out bombing raids in the region and reportedly hitting 
a hospital and fuel depot. 
  Two other planes involved in the raid, which apparently was 
aimed at a weapons factory under Moslem control in Novi Travnik, 
were not hit and returned to their base in the northwestern 
Bosnian town of Banja Luka, UN officials said. 
  Boorda said he gave the two U.S. Flying Falcons the go-ahead 
to fire after the Galeb pilots ignored two warnings "to land or 
be engaged." He said the US jets fired six missiles before 
returning safely to their base in Aviano, Italy. 
  He said the Serb attack "was clearly the first time that we 
have seen fixed-wing aircraft flying over Bosnia since the 
no-fly zone has been enforced." Previously, only helicopters 
had violated the UN no-flight ban launched in April 1993, he 
said, adding that he hoped Monday's violation "will be the final 
such incident in a tragic war." 
  He warned, however, that any further violations "will simply 
not be tolerated." [passage omitted]

  [Text] [Announcer] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman 
arrived in our country today. Both delegations held talks, 
stressing that there are sound bases for bilateral cooperation. 
Berisha and Tudjman commented on today's attack against Serbian 
planes. For more details, let us hear the report prepared on 
this occasion: 
  [Koleci] At the invitation of President Berisha, Franjo 
Tudjman, president of the Republic of Croatia, arrived in Tirana 
today, heading a Croatian delegation. He is accompanied by 
Croatian Economy Minister Nadan Vidosevic, Tourism Minister Niko 
Bulic, and Deputy Foreign Minister Ivo Sanader. 
  Berisha considered the visit by the Croatian president to be 
another possibility to contribute not only to bilateral 
cooperation but to peace in the region as well. Meanwhile, the 
Croatian president assessed the time of this visit as very 
important for events in southeast Europe. 
  At Rinas airport the high-level Croatian personalities were 
received by President Berisha, Malasi and Vukaj, People's 
Assembly Presidency deputy chairmen, Deputy Prime Minister 
Kopliku, Foreign Minister Serreqi, etc. President Tudjman also 
shook hands with the diplomatic corps accredited in Tirana. 
  Berisha and Tudjman held a special 30-minute meeting at the 
Presidency. Later they continued with talks between both 
delegations. After the end of these talks, both presidents 
spoke to correspondents: 
  [Begin Berisha recording] With President Tudjman, we 
discussed the development of friendly relations between Albania 
and Croatia to find a sound and all-round basis to develop these 
relations, and I am convinced that the visit of President 
Tudjman is a real contribution in this direction. The 
cooperation between Albania and Croatia is at the same time a 
contribution to regional cooperation. It assumes great values in 
the future in the framework of a broad regional integration. 
[end recording] 
  [Koleci] The visit of the Croatian delegation in Albania, 
Mr. Tudjman declared, and the talks held with the Albanian 
delegation will serve to promote bilateral ties and more 
successful common efforts for a commitment by the international 
community to intervene in our region. During the talks, we 
found complete understanding. 
  Berisha and Tudjman commented on today's act by NATO -- the 
downing of four Serbian planes which violated the UN flight 
embargo on military planes in Bosnia. 
  [Begin Berisha recording] We consider the NATO response to 
the Serbian aggressor in the (?bosom) of Bosnia to be legitimate 
and very important. We think that the courage and bravery of 
the U.S. pilots will accelerate peace and stability in the 
region. [end recording] 
  [Koleci] Mr. Tudjman assessed this act as a sign and signal 
that the international community will continue efforts to solve 
the crisis in Bosnia and create conditions for peace in the 
region. 
  Wishing for a more concrete pronouncement, I asked Mr. 
Tudjman how he would assess today's act, and he said: It is an 
act of determination of the superiority of the international 
community and Europe to oppose the Serbian aggressor, but also 
to put barriers on Russian intervention in the Balkans. 
  This afternoon the Croatian president and the delegation 
accompanying him will meet Prime Minister Meksi and Parliament 
Chairman Pjeter Arbnori.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] The high level Croatian-Albanian 
talks that were held in Tirana in the light of the 
implementation of the UN resolution on the downing of Serb 
planes in the Bosnian sky. [sentence as heard] The two sides 
were led by Presidents Franjo Tudjman and Sali Berisha. 
Andjelko Perincic reporting: 
  [Perincic] Addressing reporters after the talks, the 
Albanian 
president said the attack today by NATO aircraft was an 
important action and that the U.S. pilots' courage will 
contribute to peace and stability. He reiterated the well-known 
Albanian position that the Serbs were the only aggressor in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Commenting on the implementation of the UN resolution 
whereby 
force can be used against the Serb planes, Croatian President 
Tudjman said that this action showed: 
  [Begin Tudjman recording] Resolve by the main European 
states 
and the main world superpower, the United States, to oppose the 
Serb aggression and, I would also say, Russian interference in 
the Balkans. [end recording] 
  [Perincic] Both presidents said that existing cooperation 
between Croatia and Albania could be significantly intensified 
and improved. The Albanian president believes that this meeting 
could provide an impetus for improved cooperation, and our head 
of state said that their good relations could influence efforts 
by international circles to establish peace in this part of 
Europe. [passage omitted] 
  President Tudjman is now expected to hold talks in his 
temporary residence in Albania with Albanian Prime Minister 
Aleksander Meksi and Parliament Speaker Pjeter Arbnori. 
Croatian Deputy Foreign Minister Ivo Sanader and Albanian 
Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi will also hold talks. [passage

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Official talks between Albanian 
President Sali Berisha and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman 
were held at the Presidency today. Both presidents assessed the 
importance of this meeting both at the bilateral and the 
international level. They expressed the opinion that all 
possibilities exist between our two countries to strengthen the 
economic cooperation with reciprocal profit, which can include 
various fields. The signing of cooperation agreements in 
tourism, the petroleum industry, and the cooperation between our 
universities and that of Zagreb mark the first steps in this 
direction. However, this cooperation can be extended in other 
fields, such as in agriculture, energy, education, culture, and 
more. In this context, it is indispensable to create a judicial 
cadre between both our governments. 
  While treating the situation in the region, both 
counterparts 
hailed the NATO decision on Bosnia as a deserved response to the 
Serb aggressor, something that contributes to reaching a 
solution for the conflict there. 
  I assess your efforts, President Berisha said to President 
Tudjman, and I think that the creation of a Croat-Bosnian 
federation or confederation, about which talks are being held in 
Washington, would bring peace closer and assist in the long-term 
stability of the region. In this framework, I consider a 
solution to the problem of Kosova as indispensable. We estimate 
that, without the solution of this problem, there can be no 
solution to the crisis in the Balkans. That is why we request 
that the embargo on Serbia should be related to the solution of 
the problem of Kosova. We stress that this solution does not 
mean a change of borders through force, but a guarantee of the 
freedoms and rights of Albanians in conformity with the Helsinki 
Act. 
  President Tudjman said that Croatia is directly interested 
in 
stopping the conflict and is making all efforts in this 
direction. Croatia hopes for positive results from the 
agreements signed between the Croats and Muslims in Washington.

  [Text] This afternoon, talks between the Croatian 
delegation led by President Tudjman and several members of the 
government cabinet led by Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi were 
held at the Palace of Brigades this afternoon. It is to the 
benefit of both our countries to expeditiously put bilateral 
cooperation on the road to implementation, Croatian President 
Tudjman pointed out. 
  Mr. Meksi considers the visit of the Croatian delegation 
presided by President Tudjman to be important and expressed his 
conviction that all the conditions exist for passing from the 
agreements and projects to their practical implementation. Both 
sides greeted the achievement of an agreement in the fields of 
petroleum, tourism, education, culture, science, etc. 
  The Croatian side expressed readiness to offer its 
experience 
in the fields of the production of petroleum, chemical 
fertilizers, the modernization of refineries, the construction 
of petrol stations, and the buying of electrical energy from our 
country. It also expressed the desire to set up a cement 
factory and cooperate in the copper and marble industries, 
communication, etc. The Albanian side viewed cooperation in 
these fields with much interest and reciprocal profit. 
  Mr. Tudjman and Prime Minister Meksi exchanged opinions 
about 
the situation in the region as well. They assessed the NATO air 
attack as a response to the Serbian aggressor and expressed 
their readiness to contribute to the establishment of peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  People's Assembly Presidency Chairman Pjeter Arbnori and 
Messrs. Ali Spahia, Namik Dokle, and Teodor Laco held a joint 
meeting with President Tudjman. 
  During the meeting, Mr. Pjeter Arbnori said that the stable 
states of the region may and should play an important role in 
Balkan stability. All the states that aspire to democracy and 
peace should stop the Serbian aggressor. This may be done 
through dialogue and solidarity with one another. Mr. Arbnori 
stressed that Albania wants to have good relations with all the 
regional countries. Croatia is for us a neighboring and friendly 
country, that is why we want to strengthen bilateral relations 
and cooperation. 
  President Tudjman and Mr. Arbnori also focused on the 
situation in the Balkans, Kosova, and the broader region. 
  This afternoon, too, Deputy Foreign Minister Arian Starova 
and his Croatian counterpart Ivo Sanader had a mutual meeting, 
at which they expressed ideas about the problems of the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], Kosova, and elsewhere. Starova 
and Sanader analyzed the changes of the situation in the Balkans 
and determined the attitudes of Albania and Croatia regarding 
these problems.

  [Text] The president of the Republic's spokesman reports 
that President Sali Berisha harshly condemned the decision and 
considered criminal and barbarous the final act of the Serbian 
Government against the Academy of Sciences and Arts of the 
Republic of Kosova. This is an unprecedented escalation in the 
history of present civilization and in the fight against 
science, culture, and truth. 
  With this the Serbian regime testifies once more to its 
determination to fanatically implement the criminal memorandum 
of the Academy of Sciences which, drafted on principles of 
anticivilization and barbarism, sets forth the notions of ethnic 
cleansing and the erasure of thinking in other nations. 
  The Serbian circles can close a building, but they can by no 
means suffocate the thinking and scientific truth of the 
Albanian world. The act is as antiscientific and illegitimate 
as it is barbarous.

<F P=106> [Report by Aida Shehu from Brussels] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer] Let us follow a telephone report by 
the spokesman of the President's Press and Information Office, 
who will inform us about the meetings President of the Republic 
Sali Berisha held in Brussels with high personalities of 
international institutions. 
  [Shehu] Yesterday President Berisha held a meeting with 
members of the European Parliament's Foreign Policy Commission. 
After the opening speech by the chairman of this commission, 
Baron Crespau, President Berisha took the floor. He said that 
20 months ago the chairman of this parliament received him at 
this building as a newly elected president. At that time, 
Albania had elected a democratic government after 65 years. 
However, the challenge it had to face was enormous. Mr. 
Klepsch assured me that the solidarity and support of the 
European Parliament and Community will not be absent, even for 
Europe's forgotten country, that is, our country. Today, this 
may seem a bit superfluous to anyone here, but I can assure you 
that my country has had a history of pure success during this 
period. For this, the main merit certainly belongs to Albanians 
who, though under more difficult conditions than others, 
committed themselves with extraordinary courage to the most 
painful course of the reforms. 
  Within two years, they managed, with great efforts and 
sacrifices, to lay the foundations of a society based on the 
rule-of-law state and free initiative. However, I would stress 
that the assistance granted by the European Community has been 
vital for the victories and development of democracy in Albania. 
That is why I would like to whole-heartedly thank you for the 
assistance that you have granted and continue to grant to our 
country. 
  President Berisha later briefed the participants on the 
current situation in Albania and the course of the reform in all 
fields: economic, institutional, and legislative. Berisha 
briefly mentioned some figures and statistics. Regarding the 
economic field, he stressed that inflation has been brought 
under complete control. It has reduced from 40 percent, which 
was the monthly increase at the beginning of the reform, to 33 
percent in 1993. In a free exchange rate course, our currency 
is stable and has even gained a lot. The budget deficit has 
decreased from 60 percent to 10 percent. Prices have been 
completely liberalized. We have managed the complete 
privatization of agricultural land and housing units. During 
one year, more than 100,000 people have been employed in the 
private sector. Meanwhile, the privatization of medium and 
small enterprises is proceeding rapidly. Urban transportation 
has been privatized and we are trying for a large scale 
privatization of large enterprises, railways, ports, 
hydroelectric power stations, etc. Albania ended 1993 with the 
highest economic growth rate in Europe, an increase that can 
amount to 10 percent. There are some promising beginnings 
regarding foreign investments. 
  As for the institutional field, President Berisha stressed 
that the heritage of the communist regime could not serve as a 
basis for building a democratic society. The government that 
emerged from the elections was courageously engaged in a deep 
institutional reform. Thus, besides the real revival of the 
government administration on the basis of advanced legislation, 
we set up an independent judicial power and the Constitutional 
Court. The infamous secret police were completely dissolved and 
this service was rebuilt from the very beginning. In 
coorporation with NATO and its members, we are carrying out a 
reform of the army. In the same way, the Albanian police force 
was subject to a deep reform and its staff was reduced by half. 
Of 18,000 policemen, it now numbers 8,500. The diplomatic 
sector also had to undergo reform. In general, the 
institutional reform has been deep and, of course, painful. 
However, we can say that its first fruits are positive. 
  Regarding the legislative field, President Berisha said that 
we think that greater importance should be attached to the fact 
that today basic human rights and freedoms have become a 
permanent reality. Thus, freedom of assembly and association 
has been implemented in the creation of dozens of political 
parties, associations, and independent organizations. No one in 
Albania is convicted for their beliefs today. Albania has the 
greatest number the independent and private newspapers and 
journals per capita in Europe. Albania is not only a country of 
religious pluralism, but also of religious tolerance. Albania 
has adopted the most liberal system of free movement of the 
people. The freedom of private property is completely 
guaranteed. The rights and freedoms of an individual are 
guaranteed in Albania for all citizens, be they of Albanian 
origin or of minorities. Considering the treatment of 
minorities, Albania constitutes an example that I think can be 
followed by other countries as well. 
  Closing his speech, President Berisha thanked those present 
and expressed his gratitude for the encouragement the council 
and the commission gave in their 9 February resolution to bring 
to the European Parliament the proposals on Albania's associate 
membership of the European Union as soon as possible. He 
continued to say that he considered the commission's support for 
the aspirations of integrating Albania into Europe to be not 
only very important for Albania, but also a valuable 
contribution to establishing peace in the Balkans, to 
encouraging the Europeanization of this turbulent region between 
West and East, and to achieving stability on our continent. 
  Berisha later had a long conversation with the members of 
this commission and answered the participants' many questions. 
  At 1945 yesterday Berisha had a meeting with European 
Parliament President Egon Klepsch. To honor President Berisha, 
Klepsch hosted a dinner after the meeting, attended by the 
members of the Albanian delegation and many members of the 
European Parliament. 
  This morning, President Berisha was invited to a meeting 
with 
CNN television. Berisha answered the varied and numerous 
questions posed to him.

<F P=106> [Interview with Romanian President Ion Iliescu by Corina </F>
Dragotescu; place and date not given: "Any Government in 
Romania Must Be a Government of Reform"] 
  [Text] Recently there have been several surprising 
evolutions in our political life. The breakup of the 
pentagonal, the start of dialogue between the PDSR [Social 
Democracy Party of Romania] and the PD [Democratic Party], the 
"dual" government formula, and the resumption of discussions 
with the opposition are issues that appear every day on the 
front page our newspapers. 
  We asked Romanian President Ion Iliescu to give his views 
concerning these most recent events. 
  [Dragotescu] In your opinion, what chance is there that the 
PDSR and the PD will reconcile their differences? 
  [Iliescu] I believe that what is under discussion here is 
not so much the programmatic aspect of the respective issue but 
certain obstinate behavior that has appeared in human relations. 
Therefore, I believe that dialogue is difficult also because of 
these resentments that have arisen and, certainly, because of 
the fact that these resentments are emphasized by certain 
principles. It is always easy to break up a relationship but it 
is much more difficult to repair it. Probably, this also holds 
true on a large scale: Namely, a military conflict can break out 
easily but it is very difficult to achieve reconciliation. A 
split in the family can also be easily provoked when people do 
not show enough concern. However, the sides make up with great 
difficulty. That is the case with political formations too. 
  [Dragotescu] Are there any misunderstandings between you and 
Mr. Petre Roman [Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) 
leader]? 
  [Iliescu] I have never had any misunderstanding with him. 
He started to move along a certain path and I believe that, in 
so doing, he also displayed certain aspects of his character 
that are not in his favor. 
  [Dragotescu] In journalistic circles, there is much talk 
about the fact that C.V. Tudor [senator, president of the 
Greater Romania Party] allows himself to attack you in certain 
ways because he has a hold on you. 
  [Iliescu] Nobody has any hold on me whatsoever. I have led 
a straight and honest life and I am not ashamed of anything that 
I have done in my life. Therefore, one should not think along 
these lines. I have to be more careful when I express myself 
because, in view of my official position, I cannot allow myself 
to start disputes and feuds with anybody. Considering the way 
in which Mr. Corneliu Vadim Tudor behaves, I believe that it 
would be completely below my dignity even to offer him a reply. 
  [Dragotescu] Do you believe in a PDSR-PUNR [Romanian 
National Unity Party] government that might operate for a longer 
time than the current government? 
  [Iliescu] It depends on several things. It is not only a 
question of direct understanding between two parties that, in 
any case, cannot form a majority. If, together, they could form 
a parliamentary majority, then, certainly, one could talk about 
it. However, given the fact that they cannot, the issue becomes 
more delicate. 
  [Dragotescu] Would you personally prefer a government that 
includes the PDSR and the opposition? 
  [Iliescu] I prefer nothing. I would like a government that, 
to a certain extent, is stable and enjoys the support of 
Parliament. I have said this often and I see that this is not 
how things are perceived at all: Political understanding 
between political formations that are included in Parliament is 
one thing and the possible structure of a government is another. 
The government might also include only specialists or 
representatives of a single political formation, but this has to 
be achieved on the basis of a political platform that has larger 
parliamentary support. No matter what kind of governments will 
follow, Romania's problems remain the same. Any Romanian 
government should be a government of reform. This, no doubt, 
requires broad political and social support. 
  [Dragotescu] Don't you think that there is a certain 
contradiction in what you are saying? On the one hand, you 
often accuse the opposition of taking provocative actions that 
lead to destabilization while, on the other hand, you accept the 
PDSR associating with the opposition. 
  [Iliescu] No! One can always criticize somebody. This does 
not mean a halt to dialogue. In a dialogue, there are also 
controversies and differences of opinions, including criticism 
of uncivilized behavior. However, I want to repeat that this 
does not mean that political dialogue should stop. The aim of 
such a dialogue is not to settle differences of opinions and to 
start an exchange of niceties. There might even be a heated 
dialogue on controversial issues between persons holding 
opposing views. However, this is the only way in which Romania's 
interests can be promoted. 
  [Dragotescu] Do you believe that early elections might be a 
solution? 
  [Iliescu] Possibly, if no other solution is found. However, 
I believe that this would not be favorable for the country. An 
election campaign would only disturb public life. This year, we 
should concentrate on doing something positive in the economy in 
order to overcome the current crisis.

  [Text] Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle is paying a 
visit to Romania today. He was received by his Romanian 
counterpart Teodor Melescanu. After the talks the sides signed 
an agreement between the governments of the two countries on 
cooperation in education, culture, science, and sports and a 
protocol on cooperation between the two Ministries of Foreign 
Affairs. 
  According to the statement made by the Romanian minister of 
foreign affairs, the discussion with his Slovene counterpart has 
emphasized the continuous improvement of the bilateral 
relations, particularly regarding trade exchanges. The sides 
also tackled the need to harmonize the positions of the two 
countries on the issue of Euro-Atlantic integration and the 
cooperation among the countries in our region. 
  Mr. Lojze Peterle expressed satisfaction with the documents 
signed, which he assessed as an important step forward in the 
cooperation between Romania and Slovenia. He added that he 
talked with the Romanian foreign minister about the need to 
speed up the efforts to find new avenues for economic and 
political cooperation, our correspondent reports. 
  Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle also had talks at the 
Ministry of Trade on the current stage and prospects of the 
trade and cooperation relations between the two countries. He 
pointed out that, although the transition to the market economy 
and the embargo imposed on Yugoslavia have affected the 
bilateral trade exchanges, they nevertheless doubled last year, 
compared to 1992. The Romanian and Slovene delegations 
expressed the hope that the two states will shortly sign an 
accord on economic cooperation, which has already been agreed 
upon by the experts of the two countries, as well as other 
agreements and understandings to facilitate trade exchanges and 
bilateral cooperation. 
  The Slovene foreign minister will also meet with the 
Romanian 
president, the prime minister, and the presidents of the two 
chambers of parliament this evening.

<F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "The Washington Sensation"] </F>
  [Text] Everybody in the world has heard the news. The 
head of the anti-KGB section of the CIA, Aldrich Hazen Ames, was 
arrested on Monday [21 February] afternoon. He is accused of 
spying for the KGB. The information revealed to the press about 
this sensational affair seems to have been taken from police 
movies and novels. Aldrich Hazen Ames has worked for the KGB 
for several years. He was at the head of a team that was in 
charge of discovering KGB spies in the United States. It is 
easy to imagine how good the KGB agents felt after Aldrich Hazen 
Ames was recruited. It is also easy to imagine -- from what one 
learned from police movies and spy novels -- how much disaster 
his betrayal must have caused to honest CIA agents. It is also 
thrilling to think of how he was being followed by the FBI from 
the moment when his foolish expenditures became suspicious. His 
house was discretely searched, all rooms bugged, and he was put 
under constant surveillance. And with this, the spy novel has 
ended. However, a political novel begins now, and this will 
last for quite some time. This will happen because this 
espionage affair, that is, the Washington sensation, is also a 
political affair. From this point of view, we should first note 
that Aldrich Hazen Ames' arrest is a revelation for the whole 
world, but mostly for Eastern Europe. Among several illusions 
created by the dissolution of the Soviet Union was the belief 
that the KGB has reduced its power in the world and in Eastern 
Europe. However, the Monday afternoon event shows us that the 
dismantlement of the Soviet empire has by no means weakened the 
force of the KGB. On the contrary, if we were to judge by the 
blow given to the CIA, the KGB seems to have become even more 
powerful. It is true, Aldrich Hazen Ames was recruited during 
the Cold War. However, he also continued to work for them 
successfully after increasingly more frequent talk in the world 
about the Russian-American friendship. For the Americans and 
for the West in general, the arrest of the high CIA official 
might have the positive effect of an alarm clock. Whoever is 
still dozing, seduced by the pro-American smiles of the leaders 
in Kremlin, will certainly wake up for good. The disclosure in 
Washington proved that in a more thorough plan than that 
required by protocol -- and intensely publicized -- Moscow's 
current policy toward the United States and the West does not 
differ much from the policy promoted by Moscow in the past. If 
Aldrich Hazen Ames' arrest is important for the West, for 
Eastern Europe and for us Romanians it is crucial. With our 
sharp awareness of scenarios, we suspected that the KGB has not 
meanwhile become a charity institution. We had the feeling 
that, after December 1989, the KGB has not only not weakened its 
activity in Romania, but more than that, it has strengthened its 
activity. Likewise, we had the feeling that behind many of the 
puzzling events that have taken place during the past four 
years, one could sense the shadow of an institution for which 
the December 1989 events were an excellent opportunity to 
recover and expand its network in Romania. However, all this 
was simple suspicion. Now, after the sensational discovery in 
Washington, we have confirmation. The KGB had a man infiltrated 
in the vital core of the CIA and, through this, the vital core 
of the United States. The agent of the Moscow institution 
worked intensively for quite a long time, without any of the CIA 
suspicion-machinery having realized that the CIA is undermined 
from the inside. What can we say about Romania's poor secret 
services?! What can we say about all the other institutions of 
our current leadership?! The KGB succeeded in penetrating the 
CIA leadership. Can we believe so easily that it did not 
similarly succeed in the case of Romania? Romania, a country 
where the secret services have been established only recently. 
Romania, a country where certain people can be bought, not with 
one and a half million dollars, as was the case of the high CIA 
official, but with a thousand times less. People might say that 
I am not fair. That I do not take Romanian patriotism into 
consideration. These would be valid objections, had there not 
been a certain reality that every sensible person in Romania 
noticed. After December 1989, every time our country was about 
to take a decisive step toward the West, something cropped up in 
the domestic arena to stop it. Something that continued to keep 
Romania in a state of isolation that was wished by Moscow and 
thus by the KGB. Such events were: the miners' incursion in 
Bucharest, anti-Semitic attacks, and the distrust of certain 
dignitaries who viewed our integration in European structures 
favorably. Can anybody be really certain that, behind these 
bizarre facts, there are no people like Aldrich Hazen Ames?

<F P=106> [Commentary by Maria Wagrowska: "Why Now?"] </F>
  [Text] The shooting down of the aircraft over northern 
Bosnia has been the first military intervention in the Yugoslav 
conflict as well as the first combat action in the 45-year-long 
history of NATO. 
  The possibility of an operation by the Western air forces 
should have been taken into account. Since April 1993 there has 
been a UN resolution which envisions the possibility of such a 
reaction to the violation of the air space over Bosnia. Since 
the spring of 1993 NATO has allowed the possibility of taking 
military action whose purpose goes beyond the defense of the 
territories of the "16." However, in the past as many as 500 
cases of violating the no-fly zone were noted. Why, then, has 
NATO decided to shoot down the aircraft now? 
  The information coming from the NATO headquarters suggests 
that the organization's strategists did that for military 
reasons. Their arguments boil down to the statement that there 
had never before been such a significant violation of the no-fly 
zone and that there had never been a need for an unambiguous 
reaction. 
  Despite that, one can suppose that NATO undertook the 
operation for political reasons as well. Acting with the 
authorization of the greatest international organization--the 
United Nations--it decided to underscore that it is the only 
political-military grouping in the world which is able to take 
an effective military action, an action that corresponds to the 
challenges, threats, and needs of the present day. The NATO 
operation in Bosnia has no characteristic features of an 
offensive action (the organization excluded such a character of 
military operations also in the era of confrontation with the 
East) or of a revenge action. It is an action aimed at 
restoring peace in a regional conflict. 
  It offers the Western alliance a chance to regain its 
credibility, which has been eroded by a lack of action since the 
beginning of the Yugoslav tragedy. NATO's action shows that 
this organization feels responsible for the security of the 
regions located outside of the traditional area of NATO 
operation. However, it may also show that the West does not 
want to leave such regions in the zone of Russia's influence.

  [Text] Warsaw, 28 Feb--Deputy Prime Minister Aleksander 
Luczak has received Nicholas Rey, ambassador of the United 
States to Poland. During the meeting, opinions were exchanged 
on the implementation of agreements on student and academic 
exchange signed between Poland and the United States, the 
Government Press Office has disclosed. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Aleksander Luczak described changes 
that had recently been introduced in the structure of the 
department of education aimed at achieving increased efficiency 
of teacher training. 
  He also expressed the view that forming one organization 
that 
would represent the interests of Poles living in America would 
have a positive influence on contacts of the American Poles with 
their mother country. The Polish Government will make efforts 
to persuade American Poles to form such an organization. 
  Ambassador Rey pointed out that the U.S. Government was 
following with interest and positively assessed the course of 
reforms in Poland so far. 
  The two interlocutors agreed that the condition for Poland's 
preserving its international credibility was firm financial 
discipline. They also expressed the hope that the Partnership 
for Peace program would become a factor in bringing Poland and 
the United States closer together, the Press Office statement 
says.

<F P=106> [Article by DP: "Walesa's Destruction"] </F>
  [Text] On Tuesday [22 February], President Walesa decided 
to withdraw his representative on the National Assembly 
Constitutional Commission and the constitutional draft that had 
been presented before the Commission earlier. 
  He affirmed his decision in a letter to Sejm speaker Jozef 
Oleksy: "Because my constitutional initiative was rejected 
already after its first reading without a serious discussion and 
without so much as am examination, I have decided to withdraw my 
representative from the Constitutional Commission. At the same 
time, I withdraw my constitutional draft." 
  "One is surprised by the president's decision," says speaker 
Oleksy. ``It is regrettable that he has withdrawn his candidate 
because that narrows down the scope of consultations. In his 
statements today, the president did not confine himself to 
constitutional matters, but also referred to the entire 
parliament. It is not quite clear what he had in mind when he 
spoke of the need to suppress the postcommunists. After all, he 
himself gave the postcommunists a chance. Well, that's it. The 
Sejm majority rejected his constitutional draft. 
  "But what surprises me most of all is that the president 
does 
not know if he will hold talks with the Sejm on 
nonconstitutional topics. I think he made a mistake or a slipup 
when he said that there is a conflict between the president and 
parliament in every single country, for example in Russia. That 
possesses militant undertones, and is hardly an appropriate 
thing to say. 
  "I have the impression that the president does not want to 
see a constitution adopted in the nearest future. I fail to 
understand what he means when he says `graveyard peace.' 
  "I will talk to the president and try to clarify with him 
what the powers of the highest state bodies are. That is a 
subject of my concern. Provided, of course, that it is still 
possible to talk to him. 
  "I see no reason to make loud noises about a break of 
relations between the president and parliament, even if the 
president has suffered a defeat because of the rejection of his 
legislative initiative. I would not like confusion and 
political squabbling to be the only way to achieve objectives.'' 
  Says Aleksander Kwasniewski, chairman of the Constitutional 
Commission: "The president has commenced his election campaign 
too early. He wants to use the constitution as his chief 
political argument. We will support the constitution that has 
been prepared by parliament, but the president, at the head of 
nonparliamentary forces, will call on people to shun it." 
  Kwasniewski recalled that the Constitutional Commission has 
not only the right but also the duty to fulfill the law on 
preparing and adopting the constitution, whether or not the 
president takes part in this work. But he fears that the 
president is intent on deflecting the debate away from the 
constitution toward politics in general and the subject of who 
supports the president and who does not. 
  "We are approaching an absurd situation," Kwasniewski 
continues. "Either we have democracy and parliamentarism, where 
we respect the law, or we have a destabilization of the state 
and the use of illegitimate legal methods. We are now dealing 
with an offensive against parliament just because we won the 
elections. That is a repetition of the old communist principle 
whereby power lies wherever the communists happen to be, and 
everything not connected with the communists has nothing to do 
with authority, or parliamentarism, or democracy."

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Kwasniewski, chairman of Social </F>
Democracy of the Polish Republic, an SLD component, and chief of 
the SLD Parliamentary Club, by Ewa Kaszuba; place and date not 
given: "I Continue To Be Effective"] 
  [Excerpts] [Kaszuba] What happened to make the most 
effective politician of last year, as you were described, begin 
this year with conflict and defeat? 
  [Kwasniewski] I continue to be effective. 
  [Kaszuba] By losing to Prime Minister Pawlak? 
  [Kwasniewski] And what do you think I lost to him? 
  [Kaszuba] You lost influence over the cabinet, as well as 
[former Finance Minister] Marek Borowski. 
  [Kwasniewski] So you think Pawlak won by letting Borowski 
go? 
  [Kaszuba] No, I do not, but you lost in a double way. 
  [Kwasniewski] It is not the case that when you have a 
coalition arrangement, some can win at the expense of others. A 
coalition arrangement is a system of "joint vessels," it is a 
concept which is either implemented together, or not. 
Borowski's resignation constitutes a weakening of the cabinet 
and it is also a bad message being sent to the public, both in 
Poland and around the world: In Poland the message is: They 
are arguing. The message around the world is: A man whose 
economic ideas were beginning to be widely accepted, leaves 
under strange circumstances. And that is more of a mistake by 
the prime minister--it is he who is in charge of the team--than 
it is mine because I made efforts for Borowski to stay. It is 
wrong to look at this from the point of who wanted to spite 
whom. I do not evaluate my efficiency by looking at disputes 
with Pawlak, Walesa, or anybody else. The efficiency, both mine 
and the government's, will first of all be measured by [Sejm] 
approval of the budget in its current form. That budget is hard 
to accept, but it is rational. Secondly, the efficiency will be 
measured by the government's presentation over the next few 
months of its strategies of action regarding the economy, social 
policies, and international affairs. Third of all, that 
efficiency will be measured by the world's acceptance of the 
unique phenomenon of a Democratic Left Alliance-Polish Peasant 
Party [SLD-PSL] cabinet. And fourth of all, it will be measured 
by the coalition's consistent behavior, one which would not mean 
wasting time on fruitless disputes. If these things happen, 
over the coming weeks or months, then it will turn out I am 
effective. And it does not make sense to speak in terms of who 
won over whom. I said from the very beginning that there is no 
formula of a prime minister without portfolio--one makes 
decisions and bears responsibility, while the other is the chief 
of the parliamentary faction. That is why reports on my 
political death are premature, just as reports about my enormous 
power and influence were unjustified. 
  [Kaszuba] You have accused the prime minister of having 
breached the coalition agreement. But the agreement is not any 
kind of legal document, but a gentlemen's agreement. If there 
is someone to commit a breach of such an agreement, then you 
simply refuse to speak to that person anymore. 
  [Kwasniewski] Of course, the Constitution's importance is 
superior in that regard, but there are different kinds of 
agreements outside of the Constitution's scope, and every one of 
these agreements has its own significance. Once we decide to 
begin breaching these agreements, then we will be constantly 
dealing will courts and attorneys. The coalition agreement is 
not a gentlemen's agreement but a very significant document 
which constitutes this cabinet's basis. The agreement must be 
respected, and if there are problems with implementing any of 
its provisions, then there must be a system of early warning, 
for negotiating, renegotiating, and so forth. 
  [Kaszuba] And what if one of the parties commits a breach of 
the agreement? 
  [Kwasniewski] Then a few harsh words must be exchanged, some 
principles must be established, and then one must wait and see 
what will happen next. Since the situation is new and not 
everyone has matured enough to go through it, we must wait and 
see what will happen over the next few weeks. 
  [Kaszuba] Dark clouds have been gathering over SLD for 
some time now. Immediately after the coalition conflict, a 
conflict with the president began, which came about in a not 
very reasonable manner, to put it mildly, also by votes of SLD 
Sejm deputies. You are responsible for the SLD Deputies' Club. 
  [Kwasniewski] I would not speak of dark clouds, even though 
some centers of power have initiated measures against the 
winners of the most recent elections; that is to say, against 
us. I warned my colleagues many times that after the pleasant 
part, problems would begin since many groups will not just let 
us get away with our victory. This applies to the right wing, 
which failed to get into parliament, and to "Solidarity" which 
is largely responsible for what happened recently. It would be 
hard to rely on special consideration on the part of the 
president. There is the parliamentary opposition which, by 
definition, cannot favor what we do. And also within PSL 
itself, as we can recall from the previous term, the positions 
on SLD were diversified: Some did not hesitate to be in contact 
with us, whereas some others were looking for support inside the 
church or in the right-wing camp. The fact that we are being 
attacked today, is nothing strange. But society can quite 
clearly see how straightforward the game really is: When 
"Solidarity" attacks us during a demonstration but at the same 
time they try to act with restraint toward PSL, then that has 
political significance. When the president notes that an 
overwhelming part of our deputies' club voted against his 
initiative, and at the same time he fails to mention that the 
PSL Deputies Club was also very predominantly against, then that 
is also a kind of game. For some politicians who lost, the main 
task is to set SLD aside again, and to achieve that, they divide 
the coalition into two parts: Those in PSL with whom they could 
possibly talk, and those in SLD who must be rejected. This is 
the reaction to our victory, a slightly delayed reaction. 
  [Kaszuba] You are talking about everyone who dislikes SLD, 
whereas I was asking about the president. 
  [Kwasniewski] I do not hide the fact that it was a mistake 
to vote against his initiatives. We did not devote enough time 
to the issue during a session of the deputies' club; if it were 
not for that, then a motion for submitting [the presidential 
initiatives] to the [appropriate Sejm] commission, would have 
been approved (even though that would not have to mean the end 
of the issue). Both the President's Office and the president 
himself were not active enough on that, either. 
  [Kaszuba] The president admitted that he had not expected 
this kind of response from the Sejm deputies, which he called 
arrogance. 
  [Kwasniewski] But on the other hand, he must take into 
account that when one reads the provisions suggested by him 
relative to a constitutional referendum, it clearly follows from 
those provisions that a dissolution of the Sejm and the Senate 
is a result not only of a lost referendum but also--and Article 
2 provides that--at the point in time when the referendum's 
results are announced. True, this could be regarded as a 
perverse joke by [presidential aide] Minister Falandysz, but 
many a Sejm deputy thought that the net result of the 
president's initiative will be that the Sejm's term of office 
will terminate at the point when the new constitution is 
adopted. In a way, I can sympathize with the position of those 
Sejm deputies who thought that. But that does not change the 
fact that I accept part of the responsibility. This was not a 
fortunate vote--I voted in favor but the opposite view 
prevailed. But that is just one side of the coin. The other 
side is the escalation of events. The Sejm is being spoken of 
in terms of being disavowed, in terms of being unrepresentative. 
Some adjectives are being used that we have not heard for a 
long time: decommunization, file-checking [lustracja], and 
speaking about Stalin, the idol, which I regard as a very poor 
joke. The president withdrew his representatives [from the 
National Assembly's Constitutional Commission], which in my view 
is not permissible under the current legal system. And finally, 
a proposal was made--which is completely deprived of any legal 
basis--that the president will prepare a constitution somewhere 
on the side. It is not possible to do that. But I perceive the 
most recent statements coming from the president as a 
willingness to alleviate the dispute, and I think it is the 
right thing to do. If there is anything I would expect from the 
Polish Republic's president, it is that we will be able to act 
peacefully in 1994, and that we will regard 1994 as a year of 
hard work, not one of conflicts, election campaigns, and 
infighting. That would be a beneficial thing for the president, 
for the cabinet, for the entire state, and for all of us. I am 
proposing that the year be devoted to talks within the 
commission and to discussing the Constitution without much 
publicity or tension. Both the cabinet and the president would 
each do with their own thing. Poland deserves this kind of year 
of tranquility. [passage omitted] 
  [Kaszuba] Looking back at the last four months and also 
taking into account SLD's situation today, do you not think it 
was a political mistake for you not to be included in the 
government? 
  [Kwasniewski] No, I do not. 
  [Kaszuba] Do you exclude such a possibility [of joining 
the cabinet] now that SLD is having problems finding a deputy 
prime minister? Consider the following scenario: You become a 
deputy prime minister, Marek Borowski becomes your chief 
adviser, while the Finance Ministry is under the control of 
someone who performs the role of the Republic's main accountant. 
  [Kwasniewski] That is not the issue. Not all the problems 
which we have to solve, lie within governmental structures. 
These problems also have their parliamentary dimension, an 
extraparliamentary one, and so forth. Once a decision is made 
that the chief of the runner-up party in the elections takes 
control of the government, the presence of a leader of the 
winning party would be an unnatural thing. That would be a 
weird situation. I limited my expectations to parliamentary 
actions and to chairing the Social Democracy of the Polish 
Republic. That was a completely natural and effective 
arrangement, with Borowski's participation. 
  [Kaszuba] But is it not strange that while a leader of the 
winning party remains on the fringes of the government, he tries 
to influence it, and he participates in conflicts which he wins 
in some cases but loses in others? 
  [Kwasniewski] I do not win any conflicts; I am just trying 
to do my job--that is, to assure support for this cabinet in the 
kind of deputies' club where it is not easy to do so. Compared 
with other countries, that is not a peculiar situation. 
  [Kaszuba] Perhaps the reason for that is that you can no 
longer leave the deputies' club since none of the members of 
parliament, who do not perform state functions, would be able to 
tame the club? 
  [Kwasniewski] No. 
  [Kaszuba] Despite assurances that the situation both within 
and around SLD is quite normal, my perception is that it is 
extremely complicated. Perhaps you took too many 
responsibilities upon yourself? 
  [Kwasniewski] I am just party chairman, the chairman of the 
deputies' club, and the [Constitutional] Commission chief. How 
can one compare that with the responsibilities which Prime 
Minister Pawlak fulfills and bears so well--prime minister, 
chairman of the faction, and party chairman? That is much more 
difficult. You [journalists] have adopted the tactic of 
fault-finding. And there is indeed some fault but not where you 
are looking for it. 
  [Kaszuba] What do you mean? 
  [Kwasniewski] The government is going through its first true 
test, that is the budget. Over the next few months, the 
government must propose three very major programs which must 
gain support from the coalition and from society at large. 
These are: A program of economic strategies, a program of 
reforms in social policies, and a step-by-step program for 
joining the European Union. Some of the work has not progressed 
very much and that is the main problem. 
  [Kaszuba] Are you not afraid of the possible results of the 
first test you mentioned? The deputies' club has announced that 
voting discipline will be enforced, but the Sejm deputies, 
especially those from the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement, may 
not stand the discipline. If this budget becomes law, SLD can 
face serious internal problems, and if it is not, then we all 
can face serious problems. 
  [Kwasniewski] That is why one must choose the lesser 
problems. First of all, the budget must be maintained--one must 
understand that. I will reject arguments like: We know there 
is no money, but the money must be found anyway. Secondly, 
there is the political dimension: The deputies' club must 
understand that the parliamentary arrangement has established a 
coalition which set up the best government it could, and that 
government in turn prepared the best budget it could. It is a 
duty of this coalition to support a budget prepared by the 
coalition's own government. Whoever refuses to understand that, 
must draw conclusions. These may be: Either: I was wrong, I 
give up my Sejm seat--that would be the most honest 
attitude--or: I was wrong but I will wait for the moment, and I 
will not take part in the club's proceedings. There is also a 
third possible position: Even if I have doubts, I will always 
decide in favor of the coalition and the government. Otherwise, 
the public will have no idea of what we are up to. These 
principles will be adopted prior to the vote and they will be 
observed to the full extent. A third issue is that the public 
must be told that this is not a budget of dreams but one of 
economic realities; strategic programs must also be proposed. I 
have been dealing with politics long enough to know that a 
government that wants to verify its popularity everyday, must 
lose, whereas a government which simply does its job and then 
faces elections at the appropriate time--such a government wins. 
  [Kaszuba] When talking about positions which you expect SLD 
Sejm deputies to take during the budget vote, you did not 
mention one of them, which may in fact prevail: Namely, that 
failure by the Sejm to adopt the budget will mean the Sejm's 
dissolution, whereas a majority of deputies in that club have 
practically no chance of being reelected for the next term. 
  [Kwasniewski] That is also a valid argument. It is not the 
main one, but it does make some sense nevertheless.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Piotr Sliwinski, chief of Piotrkow </F>
Trybunalski Voivodship Military Headquarters, by correspondent 
Pawel Larecki; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Larecki] Voivodship Military Headquarters and 
Military Clearing Centers are being besieged by young candidates 
for military schools. What is the reason for such a surge of 
interest in military education? 
  [Sliwinski] The Army gives people concrete skills and 
occupations. After graduating from a military school, a young 
man has a guaranteed job with us, a substantial salary, and the 
promise of getting an apartment soon--in other words, prospects 
of security and stability. Young men are increasingly eager to 
join our establishments. It is not that they follow a 
fashionable trend--rather, it is their chosen way of planning 
their lives. 
  [Larecki] Let us begin with university-type schools, which 
educate their students to master's degree level. 
  [Sliwinski] There are three well-known educational 
establishments at that level: the Military Technical Academy in 
Warsaw, the Military Medical Academy in Lodz, and the Naval 
Academy in Gdynia. 
  [Larecki] What about other higher education establishments? 
  [Sliwinski] After the planned reorganization, we will 
recruit students to four establishments training students to the 
level of higher technical college education. These will be: 
the Tadeusz Kosciuszko Officers College in Wroclaw, the Stefan 
Czarniecki Officers College in Poznan, the Jozef Bem Officers 
College in Torun, and the Air Force Officers College in Deblin. 
  [Larecki] There is a particularly large number of applicants 
hoping to join warrant officers schools. 
  [Sliwinski] We have 14 such schools in the country, with a 
range of specialized profiles--for example, mechanized troops, 
engineering troops, signals troops, air force, military police, 
and navy. These schools train students to the level of 
technical high school education. In addition, there are four 
noncommissioned officers schools training students to the level 
of occupational colleges: the Navy College in Ustka, the 
Military College of Music in Gdansk, the Air Force College in 
Deblin, and the General Military College in Czestochowa. 
  [Larecki] What documents are required for admission to 
military colleges? 
  [Sliwinski] An application, in preset questionnaire format, 
to join the given college (application forms are available on 
request from the Military Clearing Centers), two photographs, a 
handwritten curriculum vitae, the original copy of the 
graduation certificate from the relevant occupational college or 
high school, a reference or recommendation document from the 
school (if the application is submitted in the year of 
graduation), a copy of the birth certificate (if the candidate 
does not yet have a full or provisional identification 
document), a signed declaration undertaking to perform 
professional military service for a period determined by the 
parliamentary act on professional military service, a reference 
or recommendation from any social or political organizations to 
which the candidate may belong, and, if previously employed, a 
reference from the latest employer. 
  The documents should be submitted at the appropriate 
Military 
Clearing Center during the months of March and April. 
Candidates will have to sit examinations in mathematics, 
physics, and a foreign language, and also a current affairs 
knowledge test. 
  [Larecki] What if a candidate does not want to study but 
just to do career service instead? 
  [Sliwinski] He has two recently created military career 
opportunities open to him. The first is a five-year contract 
service for officers, ensigns, and noncommissioned officers. 
This can be extended by another five years twice, so that the 
total length of contract service can be 15 years. The other 
possibility is extended basic national service, which will be 
offered for up to four years. 
  [Larecki] A scheme has been launched whereby students of 
university-level military academies are sent to do their study 
courses abroad. 
  [Sliwinski] Yes, at some of the more distinguished American 
and French military academies. Admission is contingent on the 
candidate's passing an examination in the appropriate language 
at the relevant country's embassy in Poland. 
  [Larecki] Thank you for talking to us.

  [Text] Warsaw, 1 Mar--Marek Markiewicz, chairman of the 
National Radio and Television Broadcasting Council, on 1 March 
signed a document granting a broadcasting license to PolSat. At 
a news conference, he pointed out that the decision was final 
and could not be subject to appeal. 
  The decision on granting the license to PolSat has aroused 
much controversy. Among other things, there have been articles 
in Warsaw daily newspapers containing references to the murky 
past of the owner of this station, Zygmunt Solorz. Also, 
President Walesa has voiced his doubts. 
  On Tuesday, when explaining his position with regard to the 
controversy, Markiewicz said that, on the day when the decision 
on the license for PolSat was made, he talked about this to the 
president and Minister of State Mieczyslaw Wachowski. He said 
that "the conversation with the president was unpleasant and an 
accusation was made that the council had accepted a bribe."

  [Text] Zagreb, February 28 (TANJUG) -- Special envoy of the 
U.N. secretary-general for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi said 
on Monday that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] had not been 
involved in today's action when four planes were downed over 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  It was a NATO action, he said, which was carried out in 
agreement with the United Nations resolution on a no-fly zone 
over Bosnia-Herzegovina, Akashi told Croatian television. 
  Akashi said he had spoken to the commander of NATO's 
southern 
command who had assured him that the regular procedure had been 
respected. 
  Akashi said he had also contacted Bosnian Serb Leader 
Radovan 
Karadzic, telling him that the incident should not be 
dramatised, and that efforts to establish peace should continue. 
  NATO combat planes on Monday downed four planes near Banja 
Luka, a city in the northwest of the Bosnian Serb republic. 
Neither NATO nor the U.N. could determine to which of the 
warring sides in Bosnia the downed planes had belonged.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 1 (AFP) -- UN forces in Bosnia are 
planning to continue their operations without any major changes, 
despite NATO's downing of four Serb planes, a UN spokesman said 
here Tuesday. 
  UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Bill Aikman said 
there would be "no major change in our operations" after NATO 
planes Monday shot down four Serb jets bombing a factory in Novi 
Travnik in central Bosnia. 
  UNPROFOR commander for Bosnia British General Michael Rose 
had said Monday that the NATO intervention to enforce a 
no-flight zone over Bosnia should not affect the UN mission on 
the ground, which is a humanitarian, peacekeeping effort. 
  Aikman confirmed that jets had bombed Monday a second site, 
in Bugojno, 20 kilometres (12 miles) south of Novi Travnik, 
which is about 70 kilometres (42 miles) northwest of Sarajevo. 
He did not provide further details. 
  He said that while a ceasefire was generally holding in 
Sarajevo there had been "several incidents worth mentioning," 
namely reports of trench-digging by mainly Moslem government 
troops in attempts to advance their lines. 
  Aikman said one site of the advance was in the Jewish 
cemetery area in southern Sarajevo, a site where both French and 
Russian UN troops are present. 
  He said the attempted Bosnian advances had drawn rifle fire 
from Serb forces besieging Sarajevo and added that Rose was 
"very concerned (about the ceasefire violations) and will be 
taking it up with senior officials" on both sides. 
  He also reported that a Bosnian electrical repair crew had 
been shot at by Serb troops on Monday. Ukrainian UN troops 
protecting the repair mission had returned fire and a civilian 
bystander was wounded in the incident, he said. 
  A Moslem-Croat ceasefire in central Bosnia was "holding but 
that there were some incidents," he said. There was an "honest 
effort" by both sides, however, to observe the truce. 
  Aikman said that on Monday, 14 artillery rounds had fallen 
near Tuzla airport in northern Bosnia. 
  The airport has been shelled almost daily since UNPROFOR 
said 
in February that it planned to open it to humanitarian flights 
in March.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Stevan Cordas] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, March 1 (TANJUG) - NATO's message, after 
the downing of four aircraft over Bosnia, should have been that 
someone was taught a lesson for violating the U.N. Security 
Council resolution on a no-fly zone, but the world media persist 
in accusing the Bosnian Serbs that the planes belonged to them 
although it is unclear exactly who was taught a lesson. 
  Twenty-four hours after two U.S. F-16s shot down four 
fighters over Bosnia early on Monday [28 February] morning, 
there are still no answers to pertinent questions such as: whose 
were the aircraft, from where did they take off and where did 
the two surviving aircraft land. 
  Despite this, the world media continues accusing the Bosnian 
Serbs by citing unnamed sources and presenting types of the 
downed planes allegedly in the possession of the Bosnian Serb 
Air Force only. 
  Compared to Monday's unison chorus, the world media are on 
Tuesday taking a somewhat more cautious view of the NATO action, 
maybe because NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said he is 
not certain that the downed aircraft belonged to the Bosnian 
Serbs. 
  U.S. Vice-President Al Gore said something along the same 
lines, thus indirectly denying a statement by President Bill 
Clinton who first said that in question are Serb planes, but 
later omitted the word "Serb." 
  NATO, who has monitored the no-fly zone over Bosnia since 
its 
imposition on October 1, 1993, has data showing a total of 
1,400 violations. 
  U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) information clearly shows 
that the Bosnian Serbs are responsible for the least number of 
violations and that no aircraft have taken off from the sole 
Bosnian Serb airport, Banja Luka, since last October. 
  A number of mysteries have yet to be solved. 
  Firstly, how is it possible that NATO does not know from 
where the aircraft took off because it is hard to believe that 
its AWACS planes failed to record this. 
  If this is not the case, it is surprising that NATO has not 
announced what was filmed. 
  Despite this, a number of world agencies "uncovered" that 
the 
downed planes belonged to the Bosnian Serbs. They support these 
claims by unconfirmed reports that these aircraft attacked 
Travnik, although even neutral observers say that the Serbs have 
no reason to bomb this city in central Bosnia. 
  All these unresolved questions create the impression that 
NATO itself does not want to attach special meaning to the 
action over Bosnia.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 1 (AFP) -- A pilot who flew one of 
the four Serb planes shot down by NATO warplanes over Bosnia 
ejected from his aircraft before it was hit and is safe, the 
Belgrade daily POLITIKA said Tuesday [1 March]. 
  His plane crashed in territory controlled by Bosnian Serbs 
between Kljuc and Sanski Most, about 60 kilometers (35 miles) 
west of Banja Luka, from where the Serb planes had flown out, 
according to the paper. It gave no other details on the pilot's 
whereabouts or condition. 
  The pilots of the three other craft are believed to have 
been 
killed when their planes were shot down early Monday during 
missions to attack Moslem positions, one crashing near Bosanski 
Petrovac and the other two near Mrkonjic Grad, both about 60 
kilometers south and southwest of Banja Luka. 
  The paper said the plane that went down near Bosanski 
Petrovac had carried out its bombing mission over Bihac, a 
Moslem enclave in western Bosnia under siege by Bosnian Serbs, 
since it had no bombs on board when it crashed. 
  POLITIKA, which gave no sources for its information, said 
eight Bosnian Serb planes in all had taken off Monday morning 
but only five continued on with their bombing mission. The 
flights were in violation of a ban on military flights over 
Bosnia decreed by the United Nations in April 1993. 
  Bosnian Serb forces have denied that the planes shot down by 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization were part of their air 
force or that they had taken off from Banja Luka airport, where 
UN observers are posted. 
  The Belgrade-based TANJUG news agency meanwhile said the 
four 
UN observers assigned to monitoring Banja Luka airport were 
staying some 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the site and said 
their vehicles had recently been stolen.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, February 28 (TASS) -- The command of the 
Bosnian Serb Army has categorically refuted a report that air 
force planes of the Serb Republic in Bosnia were brought down 
somewhere over the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
  "Our air force has only one airfield near Banja Luka, and 
military observers from the U.N. force have long been present 
there. They could have noticed the taking off of planes from 
that airfield without fail," a spokesman for the Serb command 
said in an interview with the TANJUG news agency. 
  The General Staff of the Yugoslav Army also emphatically 
rejected a possibility of four planes, brought down by NATO 
fighters, belonging to the Yugoslav Air Force. 
  Strictly following a resolution of the U.N. Security Council 
banning flights over Bosnia and Herzegovina, our air force 
planes made no flights in that air space. Since the creation of 
the union republic of Yugoslavia, not a single plane belonging 
to it has ever flown outside its air space, said a spokesman for 
the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army. 
  Meanwhile, according to reports of the Moslem Radio of 
Sarajevo, today in the morning military facilities in Moslem 
cities of central Bosnia were bombed by Croatian planes. The 
time of the bombing concides with the action taken by NATO 
fighter planes against planes of the Galeb type.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Senad Durkalic] </F>
  [Text] There is no doubt that the planes downed west of 
Banja Luka were Serbian planes, although the Serbs -- true to 
their custom -- denied that this was so. The only unclear point 
is why did the Serbs gamble with NATO's patience? Did they 
expect that they would again get away with their humorless 
jokes, or have they finally started paying the high price of 
their own mistakes? According to as yet unconfirmed information, 
the illogical bombing of Novi Travnik and Bugojno is a fresh 
Serbian ploy designed to pin the blame for the bombing on the 
Croatian aviation, which would result in fresh conflicts between 
the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army. This would definitely bury the cease-fire signed between 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO, and the chetniks -- who 
else -- would profit from this. In any case, the U.S. pilots 
have exhibited their resolve to implement the UN resolutions, 
which will perhaps finally force the Serbs to reconsider their 
megalomaniacal and bestial appetites. An intercepted radio 
message, transmitted a day before the bombing of Novi Travnik, 
and ordered by the Serbian units in Donji Vakuf, reads: 
Tomorrow six of our nightingales will sing the newly composed 
Serbian heroic song about Bugojno. Are we dealing with the 
carelessness of the Serbian ham radio operator, or yet another 
rusty screw in Mladic's propaganda machinery? It does not 
matter. What matters is that four [words indistinct] did not 
work in this case, because how could six sparrows harm two 
falcons?

<F P=106> [Article by Omer Vatric from Mostar] </F>
  [Excerpt] I am deeply moved by the degree of damage in the 
eastern part of Mostar and the indescribable misery in which 
people are forced to live, but I am also touched by the courage 
with which they bear it. This is what UN Secretary General's 
special envoy Yasushi Akashi said at today's news conference, 
attended by over 50 foreign correspondents and cameramen, that 
was held during his visit to the eastern, free part of Mostar. 
During his two-hour visit to the eastern part of Mostar, Akashi 
talked to the president and members of the Mostar War 
Presidency, Smail Klaric, Safet Orucevic, Rusmir Tific, Alija 
Alikadic, and Zijo Zuljevic, as well as with Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army 4th Corps Commander Brigadier General Ramiz Drekovic. 
  Mostar is the first on the list of priorities, right after 
Sarajevo, since the situation in this city is in many respects a 
lot harder than in Sarajevo, stressed Akashi. The UN Protection 
Forces [UNPROFOR] are ready to extend maximal help, but they 
needs more troops. That is why Akashi is appealing to UN member 
states to authorize the deployment of fresh troops in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this respect, the agreement on the 
cessation of hostilities between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and 
the Croatian Defense Council [HVO], whose signing I witnessed in 
Zagreb, lends hope, said Akashi. Speaking about the conditions 
for the peaceful solution of the Mostar issue, Safet Orucevic 
acquainted Mr. Akashi and the attending correspondents with the 
five principles that the Mostar citizens would never give up on. 
They are: Mostar -- an open and undivided city; Mostar -- a 
part of the territory of the sovereign Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina; the return of all expelled citizens and the 
protection of private property; the punishment of all crimes and 
criminals on all sides; and direct participation in regulating 
the administration of the city. Mr. Akashi did not wish to 
comment on these principles for the public, at least not for the 
time being, he said. 
  The correspondents, however, showed the most interest in the 
new situation that had arisen after NATO downed four Serbian 
planes. Yasushi Akashi confirmed the news that the planes had 
been shot down, but it is interesting that he also said that he 
had been informed about this event after it happened. He 
explained that this was the usual procedure taken in 
implementing the no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina. General 
Mike Boorda [as heard] confirmed in a telephone conversation 
that this procedure had been absolutely respected, said Akashi. 
He then expressed hope that this would not change the positive 
atmosphere aimed at reaching a peaceful agreement, and that the 
fragile cease-fire would hold. Everything else would represent 
a crime against the citizens and peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
In this respect, Yasushi Akashi has already spoken to Karadzic, 
and as he told correspondents, believed that Karadzic agreed 
with him that this incident should not be turned into a case 
that would significantly influence the peace atmosphere so 
laboriously created in Bosnia-Herzegovina. After a brief press 
conference, Yasushi Akashi left for the western part of Mostar, 
which is controlled by the HVO, where he will talk to the 
Croatian side. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Feb 28 (AFP) -- Special 
UN envoy to the former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi on Monday 
called for more troops to be sent to Bosnia to end the "tragedy" 
in the southern city of Mostar. 
  "Sarajevo was a genuine tragedy, but the world should know 
that there are others, perhaps more serious tragedies in a city 
like Mostar," Akashi said as he arrived for his first visit here. 
  Some elements of an agreement that led to a ceasefire in 
Sarajevo had also been tried in an accord reached between 
Bosnian Moslems and Croats besieging the Moslem part of Mostar, 
he added. 
  The accord provides for an interposition of UNPROFOR [United 
Nations Protection Forces] troops between the belligerent 
parties and the withdrawal of heavy weapons to between 20 
kilometers (12 miles) and 10 kilometers (six miles) from the 
city by March 7. 
  Akashi said ceasefire agreements should be signed "in as 
many 
cities as possible. UNPROFOR is prepared to do its best, but 
we're short of troops." 
  In the Moslem-populated eastern sector of Mostar Akashi met 
with members of the city's "war presidency." "President" Smail 
Klaric said Mostar "will have to be an open and non-divided 
city" and be a "part of the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory." 
Croats have laid siege to the Moslem sector for the past nine 
months and have said they want to make the city the capital of a 
self-styled Bosnian Croat republic. Akashi is also to meet with 
Croat officials in the western sector. 
  No fighting was reported in the city Monday after shells 
rained down on the eastern sector Sunday in spite of Friday's 
ceasefire agreement.

  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's special envoy, 
Yasushi Akashi, had talks in Mostar today with Ivan Bender, the 
president of the Chamber of Deputies of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna, Prime Minister Jadranko Prlic, and Slobodan Bozic, 
the head of the Government Office for Relations with UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces]. Our correspondent Milan Sutalo reports 
on the talks: 
  [Sutalo] I feel that all the sides who are involved in this 
tragic conflict are now ready to make gigantic steps toward the 
cessation of hostilities and that they are ready to pay the 
price to restore a permanent peace. This conviction was 
expressed by Yasushi Akashi at the beginning of talks with his 
hosts, representatives of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. 
Recalling the agreement that was signed in Zagreb by Generals 
Roso and Delic envisaging a cease-fire, withdrawal of heavy 
weapons, interposition of UNPROFOR, and the organization of a 
mixed commission that will be chaired by UNPROFOR, Akashi said 
that UNPROFOR was ready to enter this process, but it was 
necessary for all involved parties to cooperate. We also need 
additional forces, Akashi said. 
  I think we will get support from the United Nations and its 
member countries, but only when they are sure that the 
interested parties are ready to make steps toward peace. Akashi 
recalled the importance of the talks that are currently being 
held in Washington and New York, but also said that efforts 
toward peace were necessary to be made at the local level. 
  After we have alleviated the suffering of Sarajevo, Mostar 
should be the next town where the suffering of population ought 
to be alleviated. Therefore, I would like to hear what the 
Croat side is ready to do in Mostar for the restoration of peace. 
  From what we could hear at the beginning of the talks, which 
were open to public, we can fathom what the purpose of Akashi's 
visit to Mostar is. After that, the talks were held behind 
closed doors. Here is what Yasushi Akashi and Ivan Bender said 
following the talks: 
  [Begin Akashi recording, in English with superimposed 
translation] I have had very useful and productive talks here 
with Croat leaders in Mostar and I have received assurances of 
their full commitment to peace, I have heard their concerns that 
this peace might be too fragile. That is all the more reason, 
in my opinion, that we should join forces to make this peace 
more durable. We have to start with specific concrete steps 
toward a comprehensive peace. We will not be contented with 
peace in Sarajevo, which is important [break in transmission 
lasting for 1 minute 10 seconds]. [end recording] 
  [Begin Bender recording] We discussed the restoration of 
peace in Sarajevo. We do not demand the application of that 
kind of peace to Mostar alone: We demand that the same be done 
with Mostar, Banja Luka, and Tuzla. We will persevere in that. 
[end recording] 
  [Sutalo] Asked by a journalist, Yasushi Akashi commented on 
the NATO downing of the Serb aircraft. 
  [Begin Akashi recording] This was a NATO action in 
compliance 
with the Security Council resolution concerning the no-fly zone. 
I spoke with NATO Southern Command this morning which assured 
me that they had followed the established procedures. UNPROFOR 
was not involved in this action. 
  I also called Mr. Karadzic who was in Belgrade. He assured 
me that it was important for us not to over-dramatize these kind 
of incidents. And we will continue to make efforts to restore 
peace, the process of which started in February, and we will try 
to extend it to other places and areas.

  [Text] At the news conference held this evening for 
domestic and foreign correspondents, President of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Alija Izetbegovic made a short 
statement that we have just received. 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] I have called this conference 
because many events occurred today, and I am afraid that they 
might overshadow a very important problem -- the problem of 
Maglaj. I wish to call your attention, and the attention of the 
public, to the issue of Maglaj, which for days now has been the 
target of brutal attacks and attempts at capturing the town. I 
appeal to you to write about this and to inform the public that 
the danger of Maglaj falling has still not been averted, despite 
the fact that we have undertaken all the measures on our part, 
both political and military ones in order to save the town. 
Namely, I fear that, due to events like the downing of the Serb 
planes, the violation of the Sarajevo cease-fire, and the moving 
of the tanks [from the exclusion zone] by the Serbs. I fear 
that these events, the bombing of the Tuzla airport, and so 
forth, will overshadow [word indistinct]. The problem is that 
the Serbs might (?use this excuse) to undertake a decisive 
offensive on the town. You know that the Serbs have today 
pulled out at least six tanks, we do not know the exact number, 
it varies greatly from six to 20 tanks; therefore, there is a 
chance that the number of moved tanks is much greater. This 
means that the agreement to have the Serb weaponry moved from 
the outskirts of Sarajevo has been flagrantly violated. We have 
demanded from the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] that the tanks 
be returned or become a NATO target. This example shows that we 
were right when we demanded that the aggressor's troops should 
not be allowed to stay near the surrendered weaponry. 
  I want to stress one of the more positive things and that is 
that the cease-fire with the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] 
rebel forces is being gradually implemented. Of course, it is 
not complete, but we believe that it has every chance of being 
fully implemented. The situation is somewhat unclear with the 
111th HVO Brigade whose behavior is still unclear [sentence as 
heard]. As you know, it is stationed on the southern access 
points to Maglaj. 
  Everything about the downing of the Serbian planes is known, 
and I have no particular comments on it, except that this is 
UNPROFOR's, that is, the United Nations' and NATO's first 
reaction after several hundred, maybe even more than a thousand, 
violations of the No Fly zone. 
  First, the reactions. The negotiations in Washington 
continue and they are in progress as we conduct this press 
conference. The final phase [changes thought] the negotiations 
could end tomorrow. Moreover, the finalization of the Sarajevo 
resolution is underway in the UN Security Council. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, February 27 (TANJUG) -- An elite unit of 
the British army has been sent to Bosnia on a secret mission to 
discover Serb, Moslem, and Croat heavy artillery which could be 
targets of possible NATO air strikes, the London newspaper the 
SUNDAY EXPRESS said on Sunday. 
  Sixty members of the Special Air Service (SAS) force, who 
are 
experts in mountain warfare and know the local languages, 
entered Bosnia secretly 11 days ago. British Prime Minister John 
Major gave permission for the operation after consulting United 
Nations officials, said the SUNDAY EXPRESS, as carried by 
REUTERS. 
  The newspaper also said that initial reports by the 
commandoes had supported U.N. Protection Force Commander for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, British General Michael Rose in his request 
for several thousand more peace-keeping troops. 
  Gen. Rose used to be a member of the SAS. He led an SAS 
regiment in the action to break the seige of the Iranian Embassy 
in London in 1980 and took part in a secret operation in the 
Falkland Islands during the war between Great Britain and 
Argentina in 1982.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 1 (AFP) -- In Geneva, UNHCR 
spokesman Ron Redmond confirmed that the humanitarian airlift to 
Sarajevo would resume Tuesday after a day-long interruption 
following the NATO shooting down of four Serb jets. 
  He said a decision would be made shortly on when to resume 
the UNHCR land convoys crossing Serb territory to different 
points in Bosnia, which were also suspended Monday. 
  "We are receiving the security assessments from UNPROFOR and 
UN observers in Bosnia. The trucks are loaded and ready to go. 
There is a good chance that the convoys will also be going," he 
said. 
  More than 20 airlifts to bring supplies into Sarajevo were 
planned for Tuesday, he said. 
  Though the airlifts and land convoys through Serb territory 
were halted, a dozen other land convoys went ahead as scheduled 
from Metzkovic for different towns in central Bosnia. 
  Of the convoy blocked in Hadzici, Redmond confirmed it had 
been stopped in "Serb-controlled territory by about 100 women 
who were demanding the release of their husbands apparently 
detained by the government forces." 
  "We will try again today to reason with them and get things 
going. If we do, it will be the first time in many months that 
we will be able to use that road," he said. 
  In other developments, a prisoner exchange was made Tuesday 
between 128 Moslems who had been held by Bosnian Croats at Rodoc 
and 61 Croat prisonners detained in Jablanica, the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Geneva said. 
  The ICRC, which was supervising the exchange, said it had 
also started repatriating 200 displaced Croats, mostly women and 
children, who had been living in difficult circumstances in 
Jablanica. Most had asked to rejoin their families in Mostar, 
in southern Bosnia.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 1 (AFP) -- A 12-truck Danish UNHCR 
convoy was held up overnight and still blocked Tuesday [1 March] 
from entering Sarajevo by Serb women demonstrating on a road, UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Kris Janowski 
told AFP. 
  He said there were dozens of women asking for their husbands 
to be released from what they said was a Bosnian government 
concentration camp at Pazaric, also near Sarajevo. 
  The convoy, escorted by two UN Spanish armored personnel 
carriers, had arrived Monday afternoon in Serb-held Hadzici, 15 
kilomtres (nine miles) southwest of Sarajevo. It took three 
hours to clear a Serb checkpoint there and then was held up by 
Monday evening by the women's demonstration. 
  Janowski said the blockade by civilians was similar to what 
has happened to UNHCR convoys trying to get into the 
Serb-besieged Moslem town of Maglaj in the north. That town has 
been cut off for months from humanitarian aid. 
  "We're trying to talk with them, reason with them. We hope 
for the best," said Janowski. "But it's certainly a problem," 
he added. Janowksi said Serb troops often checked the contents 
of UNHCR convoys. 
  The women's demonstration occurred shortly after the convoy 
had left the Serb checkpoint. The trucks spent the night 
overnight at a UN checkpoint, Janowski said. 
  UNHCR land convoys moving through Serb territory were 
suspended Monday as a security measure after NATO air attacks 
over central Bosnia. The Danish convoy had, however, already 
left Metkovic, in Croatia on the Adriatic coast. The UNHCR air 
lift to Sarajevo was resuming Tuesday after being suspended 
Monday, Janowski said. U.S. planes flying for NATO shot down 
four Serb jets over Vitez in central Bosnia Monday morning. 
  Janowski had said Sunday the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
had decided not to negotiate the passage of convoys as it had 
been doing but simply to announce their routes to Bosnia's 
warring parties. But he said the convoys would not use force to 
drive through checkpoints.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1000 GMT on 1 March carries in its 
regular 5-minute newscast several more reports on the fighting 
in the Republic. Reception is fair. 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina 3d Corps Information Center reports 
that "the peace agreement between the Croatian and the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina sides which, to judge by yesterday's air 
raids by the chetnik air force and the shelling of Zavidovici 
and Bugojno, is a thorn in the side of Karadzic's Serbs, has 
generally been holding. The ustasha who do not want peace 
yesterday violated the cease-fire in the Busovaca region, where 
they fired one explosive device from the direction of Zega at 
Duboki Potok. They fired with a portable rocket launcher at the 
Gornji Vakuf defense lines. The ustasha snipers opened fire from 
Relej in the Novi Travnik area at the fire brigade that was 
putting out the fire caused by the chetnik air raid. The fire 
was eventually put out and there were no casualties. The ustasha 
violated the peace in the Vitez region with sporadic small arms 
fire at the defense lines. By the way, as part of the gradual 
implementation of the peace agreement, yesterday the experts 
from the UN Protection Force entered Stari Vitez and started 
clearing the mine fields around the access points to this town. 
The next move should be the erecting of checkpoints between 
Stari Vitez and Zenica. There were no ustasha attacks in the 
area of Zepca, but they have been cooperating with the chetniks 
in their own way. They have simply turned over most of the 
dominant and strategically important facilities around 
Zavidovici to the chetnik aggressor." 
  Reporting from Kalesija, Abdulah Ridjanovic says that 
"fierce 
aggressor's artillery attacks against the defense lines and the 
free territory continued yesterday. Over 200 shells were fired. 
The Tuzla airport was also targeted with tanks and howitzers, as 
was the village of Donje Vukovije, where large material damage 
was inflicted." 
  In his report from Zvornik, Nijaz Banjanovic says that 
"yesterday afternoon the chetniks from Klisa, Kitovnice, and 
Parloge launched a heavy artillery attack on the free Zvornik 
territory. Tanks, howitzers, and mortars landed on the 
civilians of Zaseok, Nezuk, and Kobilice. One woman was killed 
in the shelling. The night passed in provocative fire with 
antiaircraft weapons and small arms at the defense lines, while 
this morning the sniper activity from the surrounding hills has 
intensified against civilians."

  [Text] Prague, Feb 26 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems late last 
week transported around two thousand of their soldiers to the 
battlefronts in central Bosnia through a tunnel under Sarajevo, 
the Czech daily LIDOVE NOVINI writes on Saturday. 
  The daily's special reporter quotes a British U.N. 
Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) officer, who asked not to be identified as 
saying that the Moslems have connected a tunnel under the 
Sarajevo airport in the southern section of the city with 
another in northern Sarajevo, whose locality as yet remains 
unknown. 
  Following a meeting with the UNPROFOR command, the same 
source said, the Moslem side agreed to place both tunnels under 
UNPROFOR's "discreet control," the daily says. 
  Bosnian Serbs several months ago warned that the Moslems had 
dug a tunnel under the UNPROFOR-controlled Sarajevo airport to 
be used as a conduit for arms and ammunition deliveries and 
transportation of troops. 
  However, Bosnian Serbs and Croats have for the past few days 
been stressing that the Moslem side has taken advantage of the 
Serb-Moslem ceasefire in the Sarajevo area to evacuate its 
troops and have them transferred to central Bosnia to help step 
up an offensive against Bosnian Croats.

<F P=106> [Report from Bihac by Mirza Sadikovic] </F>
  [Text] Multibarrel rocket launchers, howitzers, tanks, and 
mortars have been incessantly delivering fire and death 
throughout the day. The outlying districts of Bihac and Cazin 
are being systematically destroyed -- Gornje Prekounje [words 
indistinct]. The extent of the damage is enormous. There is 
also a high number of casualties. Over 2,000 destructive shells 
have landed on the defenders' lines on the Grmusa-Grabez-[name 
indistinct] plain. There is hardly a square meter that has not 
been hit by at least one shell. 
  In addition to this the chetniks are continuously launching 
combined infantry-artillery attacks on an area on the 
Grmusa-Crnanjski plain along the Grmusa-Prpici-[name indistinct] 
line. 
  This hell has been raging on throughout this evening. The 
fighters of the 5th Corps have been putting up heroic resistance 
as fierce battles continue. Provocations are also continuing 
unabated along the demarcation lines with the paramilitary 
formations of the so-called Kladusa autonomous province. This 
has been compounded by mortar fire, especially this afternoon.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 28 February carries the 
following reports on the combat situation in the Republic. 
  The studio announcer introduces a report from the Zivince 
Press Center on attacks at Dubrave airport in Tuzla. An 
unidentified correspondent from the press center says that "the 
defense lines are exposed to sporadic provocations, while 
important buildings like Dubrave airport are the target of 
artillery attacks. Howitzer shells were launched from Drvenik 
at the wider area of Zivinice. Owing to this, a general alarm 
signal was sounded. The enemy attacks did not have any 
consequences and all the defense lines remain stable." 
  Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Sermic reports that "the 
fiercest fighting, hand-to-hand fighting is in progress on the 
south and southeastern fronts, where the aggressors -- vicious 
animals -- are attempting infantry breakthroughs. Up to the 
time of filing this report, two women have been killed, while 
five civilians, three of them children, have been seriously 
injured." 
  Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac and says that "this 
morning, the chetniks once again viciously attacked the 
defenders' lines on Grabez, [name indistinct], Hasin Vrh, and 
the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau. They are again attempting 
breakthroughs in the region of the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau 
from the areas of Livaci, (?Brtnik), and (?Grmusa). Our 
defenders are resisting heroically." Provocations on the 
demarcation lines with the army of the so-called Kladusa 
autonomy have escalated since last night, particularly in the 
areas of (?Trst) and Pecigrad in the Cazin Commune. Since this 
morning, they are using mortars and are bringing in fresh forces 
and equipment. 
  Viktor Boban reports from Zavidovici and says that "an 
artillery attack from all of the aggressor's available arsenal 
began at 0900 [0800 GMT] this morning. The attack from the 
well-known chetnik positions was directed at the town center. 
Around 30 destructive shells, of which 16 were 122-mm howitzer 
shells, were fired in less than 40 minutes. The material damage 
in residential areas is immense. The morning hours on the 
Hajdarevici front were marked by fire from a chetnik Bofors. 
The situation is similar in Maholj, were the enemy is using 
antiaircraft machine guns." 
  Gorazde correspondent Fahrudin Bekic reports that "the 
chetniks continue with their dirty work. From their positions 
in Medena Glavica they used 82-mm mortars to pound civilian 
targets in Ogleceva. The usual provocations went on on the 
Rogatica route, while the enemy forces from Ustipraca used 
antiaircraft machine guns to target Gajevi. Provocations were 
also registered on the demarcation line toward Cajnice and Foca."

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 28 (AFP) -- UN forces cancelled the 
opening set for Monday [28 February] of a bridge linking the 
Serb and Moslem sides of divided Sarajevo, UN British General 
Michael Rose told reporters. 
  The commander of UN forces in Bosnia said he had "an 
agreement in principle not in writing" with Bosnian Serb 
authorities and that he felt he needed a written agreement. 
  The Brotherhood and Unity bridge between the Serb-held 
Grbavica part of the Bosnian capital and the mainly Moslem rest 
of the city was to be opened to civilian pedestrian traffic. 
"I'm not going to push the issue on either side today," said 
Rose. "I'm afraid you'll all have to come back in a couple of 
days' time," he told reporters. 
  In Belgrade Sunday, Bosnian Serb General Manojlo Milovanovic 
said his troops would use force to stop the re-opening of 
Grbavica bridge. The cancellation left over 100 Sarajevo 
residents, who had come to the bridge, disappointed that they 
could not see or get news of loved ones in Grbavica they had not 
seen in some cases since the war began in April 1992.

<F P=106> [Interview with Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska </F>
republic, by Zeljko Avramovic at an unidentified airport on 28 
February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Avramovic] Mr. Karadzic, you are leaving for 
Moscow to pay the first official visit after the triumphal 
return of Russian diplomacy to the world political scene. What 
aim does this visit have? 
  [Karadzic] This is an invitation, an official invitation to 
our delegation to come to have talks mostly about the peace 
process and the first visit will certainly pass mostly in 
further examining the possibilities of reaching peace; both 
peace in general and the one around Sarajevo, possibly around 
Tuzla regarding the opening of the airport, and so on. In a 
word, Russia is now much more present both in a diplomatic and a 
military sense and we are very pleased to be going to Russia. 
  [Avramovic] Whom are you going to meet in Moscow? 
  [Karadzic] Our hosts are Churkin and Kozyrev. We are 
certainly going to meet them and we shall see about the rest. 
So far, we do not know the plan.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Michal Berko on a news conference </F>
by Gebhardt von Moltke, deputy to the NATO secretary general for 
political affairs, and Slovak State Secretary Jan Lisuch in 
Bratislava on 28 February; passages within quotation marks are 
recorded; von Moltke speaks in English with superimposed Slovak 
translation] 
  [Text] A delegation of experts and high-ranking 
representatives of NATO came to Slovakia today. It is headed by 
Gebhardt von Moltke, deputy to the NATO secretary general for 
political affairs. 
  After the talks at the Slovak Republic Foreign Affairs 
Ministry, where they were received by State Secretary Jan 
Lisuch, they met journalists. Michal Berko reports: 
  [Berko] The aim of the visit from Brussels is to specify the 
implementation of the Partnership for Peace program, State 
Secretary Jan Lisuch said and added: 
  [Lisuch] "As to the Slovak Republic, we note that, 
altogether, we are prepared for participation in the Partnership 
for Peace program. We have been training people who will be 
active directly at the Coordination Center. Naturally, we 
consider the Partnership for Peace program a beginning of 
political and military cooperation with NATO, the first step 
toward future activities as members in NATO." 
  [Berko] After this brief explanation, Gebhardt von Moltke 
took the floor. He said that Slovakia had been very intensively 
involved in cooperation with NATO, that the Partnership for 
Peace program was not the beginning of this cooperation, but 
that it gave it a new dimension. It was based on the interests 
of the Slovak Republic. He recalled the good results of 
cooperation within the UN peace operations. He welcomed, above 
all, the fast and positive reaction of the Slovak Government in 
signing the framework document by Prime Minister Meciar. The 
talks we had here were open and took place in a friendly 
atmosphere, he said. He expressed the hope that a presentation 
[as heard] document will be quickly prepared in Slovakia on a 
sufficiently high authoritative level that would make it 
possible to transform the Partnership for Peace program into an 
implementation form. It should express the individual approach 
of Slovakia toward membership, but it should be a document that 
will endorse Slovakia's political obligations. Membership in 
NATO was not a membership in a stamp-collecting club, Gebhardt 
von Moltke said. 
  Asked whether NATO had an order for accepting the countries 
of Central Europe--the question that was brought up by former 
U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheyney when he said yesterday that 
one had to quickly accept Hungary, Poland, and the Czech 
Republic into NATO, while omitting Slovakia--Mr. Moltke said 
dryly: Mr. Cheyney was defense secretary, but then he added: 
  [Moltke] "I want to assure you that NATO has no pecking 
order, that it has not made any preliminary selection for 
acceptance." 
  [Berko] Answering numerous questions as to what extent the 
process of the Partnership for Peace program can influence the 
development in Russia [words indistinct], von Moltke said that 
we considered expanding NATO as an element of stability also for 
Russia. All, however, depended on the behavior of Russia. As to 
the address by Boris Yeltsin, Mr. Moltke said that it was 
motivated by the internal political development in Russia. 
Russia, however, was an important element of stability and 
European security, and we wanted to cooperate with Russia if it 
were willing to defend and cooperate on the basis of democratic 
principles. 
  [Moltke] We do not want to create new divisions and borders 
in Europe.

<F P=106> [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the </F>
Democratic Left, by Karol Wolf in Bratislava; date not given: 
"Peter Weiss: Prime Minister Meciar Does Not Want Elections"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The strongest Slovak opposition party 
is the postcommunist Party of the Democratic Left (SDL). It has 
28 seats in parliament, and, if an attempt is made to recall 
Vladimir Meciar's government, it will play a decisive role. In 
view of the continuing political crisis in Slovakia, MLADA 
FRONTA DNES asked SDL Chairman Peter Weiss for an interview. 
  [Wolf] What do you think of the possibility that Prime 
Minister Meciar's government may be recalled? 
  [Weiss] The reasons for such a step are clear. The prime 
minister's Cabinet demonstrates day in and day out that it is 
incapable of governing normally. On the other hand, the status 
of the possible broad-coalition government or, rather, the issue 
of whether it would have enough support in parliament is 
unclear. At the moment, we cannot count on the definite support 
of some of the deputies from the ruling Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), and, what is more significant, the 
opposition Hungarian Egyutteles movement has not given any clear 
guarantees that it will not attempt to blackmail the new 
government by making demands for its ethnic minority. 
Egyutteles is setting the kind of conditions that even a 
provisional government could not fulfill in the current 
situation. We concur in this with Carnogursky's Christian 
Democratic Movement. 
  [Wolf] What kind of conditions is Egyutteles setting? 
  [Weiss] For example, the adoption of the European Charter on 
Self-Administrations and the Charter on Minority Rights. I am 
not claiming that these issues cannot be dealt with later, but 
Egyutteles has to realize that, in the Slovak environment, which 
is strongly nationalized, no government can undertake such a 
thing. These issues must be resolved by the cabinet that will 
come out of the parliamentary elections. 
  [Wolf] What is the situation at the moment? 
  [Weiss] Negotiations are still taking place, and we have 
even tried to hold talks with the HZDS. However, Vladimir 
Meciar has made it clear that he does not want to negotiate. On 
the contrary, he has initiated a petition on holding a 
referendum. The aim of it is to expel from parliament those 
deputies who have left the HZDS and Slovak National Party Clubs. 
  [Wolf] The prime minister has let it be known that he would 
like elections as soon as possible. Do you really think he 
wants early elections? 
  [Weiss] I am beginning to think more and more that he does 
not. His plan is, in my opinion, to get the supporters of Milan 
Knazko and Ludovit Cernak out of parliament and to get into a 
situation in which he will again have a majority. Our party, 
however, is working on a proposal for the Constitutional Court, 
which has to say whether stripping a deputy of his mandate is 
possible. In my opinion, this is out of order just as it is out 
of order for a deputy to be held hostage by his party. As the 
chairman of the largest opposition party, I know what it is like 
to have a deputies' club at my disposal, but I would never be 
able to take a step that would deprive a deputy of his freedom. 
The question the HZDS wants to ask about mandates in the 
referendum can be interpreted as follows: If a deputy is 
expelled from his party, he loses his mandate. This could lead 
to a situation in which five or six party chairmen hold sway 
over parliament, and their deputies would be powerless. This 
kind of situation is absolutely unacceptable.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 1 March carries in its 
regular 10-minute newscast several reports on the continuing 
fighting in the republic. Reception is fair. 
  Describing the situation in Maglaj, Hajrudin Sermic says 
that 
"the town is still in shock after yesterday's massacre of 
civilians. A direct howitzer shot hit an ambulance killing four 
civilians and mutilating 11, three of whom were children." He 
says that "this was not enough for [Bosnian Serb military leader 
Ratko] Mladic's butchers, and the shelling of the center of 
Maglaj continued well into the night. Hundreds of howitzer 
shells and mortars landed on the town. One person was killed in 
the shelling." Sermic says that "the fierce shelling of Maglaj 
continues today. Early this morning the aggressor launched a 
powerful infantry attack on the southeastern part of the front, 
in the (Siprage)-(Strajista)-Lijesnica direction. The 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army fighters repulsed this attack, but the 
aggressor has now launched a new attack, which is under way at 
the moment." 
  In his report from Brcko, Hamid Deronjic says that "another 
enemy tank has been destroyed on this front. The heavy 
concentration and increased movement of the enemy armored and 
mechanized vehicles, registered yesterday, enabled our fighters 
to score a few points. The artillery of the 108th Motorized 
Brcko Brigade again excelled, as yesterday afternoon at 1630 it 
fired a precise shot and completely destroyed a T-34 chetnik 
tank together with its crew. So yet another in the whole series 
of Serb tanks on the Brcko front has been turned into a heap of 
useless iron. During the night the aggressor fiercely shelled 
the defense lines and civilian targets on the free territory." 
Deronjic says that "there have been further clashes among 
various groups of the Serb aggressor's army on the Brcko front. 
Last night on the Cadjavac-Sumari direction the chetniks 
exchanged mortar and small arms fire." 
  Reporting from Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that "Bihac and 
Cazin suffered further destruction overnight. Insane, bloody, 
bestial -- is there a word to describe the onslaught by chetnik 
multiple rocket launchers, howitzers, tanks, and Vis? Thousands 
of shells were fired overnight at [word indistinct], (Gornji 
Troholj), [words indistinct], and (Srdjani). The industrial 
zone of Bihac has been under the fiercest attack overnight and 
this morning." He says that "the chetniks attempted further 
breakthroughs but in vain as the heroes, the defenders, present 
an impenetrable wall. Milosevic and Karadzic must finally 
understand this." 
  Amila Salihbasic reports from Olovo that "the [Serb] enemy 
attacks continued last night. The largest part of the artillery 
that was withdrawn from around Sarajevo is now in use in the 
chetnik positions around Olovo." She says that "the first day 
of March has been marked by several mortar explosions, while 
enemy infantry has intensified small arms fire at the defense 
lines." 
  Sead Custovic reports from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 1st 
Corps that "the population of the (Vrezani) area were woken up 
this morning by powerful explosions of chetnik heavy artillery 
shells. Early this morning the aggressor from (Sovrsko Brdo) 
fired dozens of shells from an ESP [not further specified], and 
120-mm and 82-mm mortars at the region of Vrbovik. Soon the 
chetnik artillery in Podlugovi was activated, and a hill gun 
shelled (Podzupce). It must be stressed that certain positions 
from which shells are being fired are within the 20-kilometer 
zone around Sarajevo, from where the artillery pieces should 
have been moved long ago."

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1800 GMT on 28 February carries in 
its regular 45-minute newscast the following report on the 
fighting in the Republic. 
  Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Sermic reports that "the 
chetnik rabble that, thanks to the visibility here, kills 
civilians whenever it wishes, is systematically destroying a 
people. They do not even stop at targeting ambulances, 
civilians, and residential areas. An unheard-of massacre 
occurred again today. The direct hit on a clearly marked 
ambulance van that was transporting seriously injured people to 
the hospital in Tesanj left four people dead, while 11 sustained 
severe injures." 
  An unidentified correspondent reports from Srebrenica and 
says that "the population's suffering continues, and the 
everyday postponement of the Canadian Battalion's exchange 
resembles a farce. We have learned from reliable sources that 
the exchange of UN Protection Force members in Srebrenica is 
being blocked by the Serbian aggressor's resolve not to allow 
more peace forces into Srebrenica than are currently in the 
town. Moreover, the aggressor is denying entry to the white 
tanks and helicopters that are part of the Dutch forces." 
  An unidentified correspondent from the 1st Corps Information 
Service reports that "although the large-caliber artillery has 
been silent today, the aggressor has continued violating the 
cease-fire on the Sarajevo front, which resulted in one member 
of our Army being injured. This morning, the chetniks in 
Mrkovici, Zecja Glava, and Mala Kula used antiaircraft and M-84 
machine guns to target Orlic and Brekin Potok. Some time later, 
a portable rocket launcher from Gradina shelled Hotonje, while 
this afternoon antiaircraft machine guns again targeted Brekin 
Potok and Wilson's Setaliste. Chetnik snipers were also active, 
particularly those on Spicasta Stijena, Travnik Street, and the 
region of Ziga Kuca. A sniper bullet fired from Zica Kuca 
injured one of our defenders in Zabrdje."

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 28/2/1993 -- Malta's President 
Censu Tabone ended his visit in Romania on Monday [28 February] 
noon with an official ceremony to his departure. After a last 
round of talks, attended also by the members of the delegations, 
the two presidents made short statements to the press. 
  Romanian President Ion Iliescu underlined the political 
significance of the visit -- the first at that level since the 
December revolution in Romania and Mr. Censu Tabone's first 
visit in Romania -- and the favourable political climate of the 
relations between Romania and Malta. "President Censu Tabone's 
presence in Romania represents an expression of the political 
willingness to consolidate the bilateral relations and the 
collaboration within international bodies," said the Romanian 
head of state. Both parties have agreed to intensify the 
cooperation in the fields of shipment, telecommunications, 
services, tourism, science and culture. The Romanian Foreign 
Ministry will draw up a draft treaty of friendship between the 
two countries to be signed, if possible, within the current 
year, President Iliescu said. 
  In his turn, the Maltese head of state said that during the 
three days of his visit in Romania he learned of Romania as of a 
country experiencing a development process, a people who 
regained the democratic beliefs and who affirmed an European 
vocation, who is boldly integrating within the European 
structures. President Tabone expressed hope that the 
preparation of the friendship treaty would not last too long as 
its finalisation within the current year would enable President 
Iliescu to make a visit in the Republic of Malta. President 
Tabone said he would ask the Maltese Parliament and Government 
to invite the Romanian president for a visit in Malta. 
  The Maltese president's visit in Romania included interviews 
with the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Adrian Nastase, and 
with the Senate's vice-president Ioan Doru Taracila (the Senate 
president was making a visit in Japan at the time). An 
invitation was made that a Romanian parliamentary delegation 
make a visit in the Republic of Malta. During his stay, 
President Tabone visited also Sinaia mountain resort and the 
Brasov County, central Romania.

  [Text] Budapest, Feb 26 (CTK) -- The world is closely 
following developments in Slovakia and reaches the conclusion 
that "we are heading for an authoritarian regime," Jozef 
Moravcik, who resigned as foreign minister on Thursday, says in 
an interview with the Hungarian daily NEPSZABADSAG on Saturday. 
  Moravcik says that another sources of uncertainty about 
Slovakia are "some politicians, especially the series of 
ambiguous statements by Mr Premier Vladimir Meciar." 
  Turning to Hungarian-Slovak relations, Moravcik says that 
the 
conclusion of a general treaty, which would confirm the 
inviolability of the state border, is the most important thing 
at the moment. 
  He also stresses the need for international standards of 
protection of the rights of ethnic minorities to be worked out. 
The internal political aspect of the problem is to seek 
consensus with minorities' political representatives, Moravcik 
says. 
  He points out that opposition political parties have already 
entered into negotiations with the Hungarian political parties 
represented in the Slovak Parliament, though solutions the 
questions at issue have not been found yet. 
  Moravcik says that he has ended his diplomatic career for 
the 
time being and will now devote himself to home politics. Though 
the creation of a new political party is still in the phase of 
considerations, talks on the creation of the strongest possible 
"grouping of the center" have already started. 
  He added that the grouping would also embrace supporters of 
former foreign minister Milan Knazko, ousted by Meciar last 
March, and of Lubomir Cernak, who was stripped of chairmanship 
of the coalition Slovak National Party (SNS) in mid-February.

  [Text] Bratislava Feb 28 (CTK) -- Slovak President Michal 
Kovac will accept the resignations of Deputy Premier Roman Kovac 
and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik only after the proposal by 
Premier Vladimir Meciar to appoint a new foreign minister is 
approved, presidential spokesman Anton Bodis said today. He 
thus made previous information that Kovac had decided to accept 
the resignations of the two ministers more accurate. 
  Kovac rejected Meciar's proposal to appoint Jozef Prokes, 
current deputy premier and honorary chairman of the Slovak 
National Party (SNS) as new foreign minister today. At the same 
time, Kovac asked Meciar to nominate another person to head the 
Foreign and Privatisation Ministries. 
  Bodis said Meciar had accepted Kovac's request to nominate a 
new candidate to the post of the foreign minister. 
  Meanwhile, government spokesman Ondrej Hanko declined to say 
when the next meeting between Kovac and Meciar would take place 
and who were possible candidates for foreign minister. "That 
would be premature speculation," said Hanko [when] asked whether 
Slovak Ambassador to the Czech Republic Ivan Mjartan was among 
the candidates.

  [Text] Dunajska Streda, West Slovakia, Feb 26 (CTK) -- The 
new programme of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement 
(MKDH) does not raise any new claims by the Hungarian ethnic 
minority, it only wants Slovakia to join some international 
commitments concerning the minority language and autonomy, [MKDH 
Chairman] Bela Bugar told CTK on Saturday. 
  With the adoption of the programme for early elections, the 
date of which has not been set yet, the MKDH became the first 
party in Slovakia to have such a programme. Bugar said the 
programme reacted to the current political situation and to the 
creation of the independent Slovak state which is not dealt with 
in the previous programme. 
  Bugar said "we want to live in Slovakia, but we need clear 
legislative guarantees. We expect to be equal partners of 
Slovaks enjoying equal opportunities.... There is no reason for 
the Hungarians to stress their loyalty to the state more than 
the Slovaks." Bugar called President Michal Kovac "the only 
constitutional official trying to understand the Hungarian 
ethnic minority." 
  The congress was also attended by Geza Entz, the Hungarian 
Government's political state secretary and head of the 
Government Office department for Hungarians living abroad, and 
Surjan Laszlo, Hungarian Social Welfare Minister and deputy 
chairman of the European Christian Democratic Union.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 23 (CTK) -- The talks on 
cooperation between the Russian and Slovak intelligence services 
are by no means directed against any third country, as they 
primarily concern international crime, Tatyana Samolis, the 
spokeswoman for the director of the Russian Counterintelligence 
Service Yevgeniy Primakov, told journalists today. 
  Primakov, who arrived for a two-day visit to the Slovak 
Republic on Tuesday [22 February], met with deputy chairman of 
Slovak Parliament Augustin Marian Huska and Deputy Premier Jozef 
Prokes. He will also meet President Michal Kovac. 
  Our guest did not raise any objections against Slovakia's 
effort to integrate with European systems, said Huska. 
  "Shall we wait until various parts of the Russian or Chechen 
mafias establish themselves easily in Slovakia?," Huska replied 
to the question whether it was dangerous to establish contacts 
during the current unstable period in the two countries. 
  Both Primakov and Samolis refused to comment on the "Ames 
spying affair."

two-day visit to the Slovak Republic on Tuesday [22 February], 
told journalists after meeting Slovak President Michal Kovac 
today that no underhanded motives lay behind the timing of his 
visit. 
  Primakov's visit was motivated by the need to create a basis 
for cooperation between the intelligence services of the two 
countries in the fight against international crime, terrorism, 
the drug and arms trades, and the situations in unstable regions 
of Europe, Presidential Spokesman Anton Bodis told journalists. 
  "The cooperation will be not directed against any third 
country," Bodis said, adding that the intelligence services of 
the two countries agreed to exchange representatives in their 
headquarters in order to establish connection. 
  Primakov's Spokeswoman Tatyana Samolis told CTK that the 
talks with the Slovak Intelligence Service would continue 
tonight and tomorrow morning. "The issue was not raised," she 
replied to a question about the activities of Russian agents in 
Slovakia.

  [Text] Tirana, February 26 (ATA) -- Albanians are just for 
a political facade in the political organs and institutions of 
the Macedonian state, writes in one of its last editions the 
Albanian newspaper FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT, which is published in 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. 
The newspaper points out that the Ministry of Inner Affairs of 
Macedonia hasn't any Albanian official and only six of the 430 
persons working in the Macedonian customs are Albanians. 
  According to the newspaper, the situation is not better in 
the organs of jurisprudence. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
too, has no Albanian officials. This ministry organized 
recently a competition for the admission of new persons who are 
beginning to work in diplomacy. From four hundred people who 
participated in the competition, only four were Albanians. 
  Some forty per cent of the population in FYROM are 
Albanians, 
although, the authorities of the country are trying to reduce 
this figure to the minimum saying that only twenty per cent of 
the population of the republic are Albanians.

<F P=106> [Interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic by </F>
MAINICHI SHIMBUN reporter Akira Goto in Belgrade on 25 February] 
  [Text] Belgrade, 25 Feb -- Foreign Minister Vladislav 
Jovanovic, of new Yugoslavia (which consists of Serbia and 
Montenegro), granted an interview to MAINICHI SHIMBUN in 
Belgrade on 25 February. In the interview, the foreign minister 
warned against NATO's "threatening policy," saying that if NATO 
extends the target of an air-strike threat to other areas of 
Bosnia, "something unexpected will occur." He called on Muslims 
to make bold to sign a peace accord at the opportunity of the 
cease-fire in Sarajevo. 
  [Goto] How will the avoidance of NATO air strikes affect the 
Bosnian conflict? 
  [Jovanovic] NATO's ultimatum was designed to stand to the 
side of the parties in the civil war, and it nearly demolished 
the cease- fire accord reached between Serbs and Muslims. If 
NATO extends an air-strike threat to other areas of Bosnia, 
something unexpected will happen and it will spread to all areas 
of Bosnia. 
  [Goto] Some people see that the Serbian force has withdrawn 
its heavy weapons from around Sarajevo under pressure of NATO. 
  [Jovanovic] This is not true. We took the action after 
concluding that the withdrawal is a rational compromise which 
turns out to our advantage. Because we already reached an 
accord with Muslims on withdrawal of weapons several days before 
NATO's ultimatum was given to the Serbian force, the ultimatum 
was unnecessary. Because NATO has lost its enemy of the Soviet 
Union following the collapse of the Cold War structure, it is 
now seeking a new external enemy in a bid to justify its 
existence. 
  [Goto] Do you think the Sarajevo cease-fire will bring 
progress in negotiations on peace? 
  [Jovanovic] The Serbian force has made the maximum 
concessions in response to proposals included in a draft peace 
accord presented by the European Union (EU). The utmost 
concession is to grant one- third of national land to Muslims, 
and 98 percent of the draft peace accord has been agreed on. 
Now is the time to sign a peace agreement and to discuss the 
land issue that remains unsolved. We support any agreements 
among the three parties, including the Croatian. 
  [Goto] Russia played a major role in achieving the Sarajevo 
cease-fire. Do you think its influence will increase? 
  [Jovanovic] Different from American and European nations, 
Russia has adopted balanced policies toward the Bosnian 
conflict. Serb's withdrawing weapons is the product of Russian 
policies. President Yeltsin's call on American and European 
nations to hold a summit is one of Russia's initiatives. We 
support the proposal.

<F P=106> ["Report of Mr. Mazowiecki for Kosova" -- ATA headline] </F>
  [Text] Prishtina, February 25 (ATA) -- "The situation on 
the human rights in Kosova is going worse as a result of the 
discriminating acts of the Serbian authorities," stressed Mr. 
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the special reporter of the United Nations 
Commission for the Human Rights, in a report given to the 
fifteenth session of this commission. 
  The report says that the continuous lack of the dialogue 
between the Serbian and Yugoslav authorities on one side and the 
leadership of the Albanians of Kosova on the other side, has 
hindered the improvement of the situation in defined fields such 
as the parallel system of the education of the ethnic Albanians. 
Considering this question, the situation in the University of 
Prishtina remains a source of tension. This is the third school 
year during which the registration of the students, the 
lectures, the exercises, the examinations and other activities 
of more then twenty two thousand students and nine hundred 
teachers of university are going on in private houses and 
buildings. The continuous reports inform about the 
discriminating acts of the Serbian police against ethnic 
Albanians. The beatings and the tortures against them are 
common. 
  The report mentions the declaration of the head of the 
Prishtina Regional Court, who has supported the ill-treatment of 
the prisoners from the police saying that "even if their 
guiltiness is not shown by facts, they are implicated in the 
crimes against the state." Considering the use of the brutal 
force by the Serbian police, the report show the case of January 
13, when the Serbian police confiscated gold and silver from the 
shops of the Albanian owners in Prizren without giving any 
explanation. On further more, as it is reported, the police 
confiscated facilities and even passports of the ethnic 
Albanians in the cross border between Serbia and FYROM [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. On further more, the 
report writes about the illegal expel of the Albanian families 
from their houses. In most of the cases, this is carried out 
without any previous procedural law and on further more, their 
houses are given generally to the Serbian families, underlines 
the report, which adds that during January 1994 alone, the urban 
office of Prishtina has given seventeen decisions to the 
Albanians' families, who had absolute property and all the legal 
documents which proved that they had lived for decades in those 
buildings. The report also mentions facts which testifies for 
arbitrary arrests and abuse of the right for a just and on one 
sided court. 
  These abuses in particular have to do with a series of penal 
processes against ethnic Albanians in Prishtina, Peje, Gjilan 
and Prizren where Albanians have been accused for "putting in 
danger the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia." Most of the 
defendants are former officers of the Yugoslavia People's Army 
or officers of the territorial defence of Yugoslavia, informs 
the report of Mr. Mazowiecki published yesterday from the 
Albanian press in Kosova.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Sali Berisha by Jas Gawronski in </F>
Tirana; date not given: "`The World Must Save Kosovo' -- 
Albanian Leader: Belgrade Is Lying in Wait"] 
  [Excerpts] After the embargo imposed on FYROM [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] by Greece to force it 
to change its name, Albania offered its services to Skopje as a 
route to the sea. The gesture of goodwill toward this former 
Yugoslav republic -- which yesterday established diplomatic 
relations with Belgium -- is in danger of triggering another 
Balkan crisis, but it also testifies to the enterprising spirit 
of a country that is experiencing a minor economic boom and a 
new political season; yesterday, Albania became the 10th country 
from the former communist bloc to sign the "Partnership for 
Peace" with NATO. [passage omitted] 
  Berisha, 50, dynamic, charismatic, was born into a family of 
prosperous farmers and, by studying in Albania and abroad, 
became a heart specialist of repute in his country. He founded 
the Democratic Party in 1991 and progressed from one electoral 
success to another, arriving at the presidency. Sitting across 
the table from him in the rectangular dining room paneled in 
reddish wood, I cannot but begin by pointing out that Enver 
Hoxha had eaten his meals at that same table until just a few 
years ago. 
  [Berisha] That is true. You cannot even begin to imagine 
what used to happen here in Albania. It was much worse than the 
Soviet Union in Stalin's days. Perhaps a comparison could be 
drawn with the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia. I am against 
witch-hunts, partly because more or less everyone had a hand in 
it: At the last election under the dictatorship, only 35 
Albanians voted against the Communist Party. But the most 
glaring cases must be punished, such as those three district 
leaders who executed a number of youths who had tried to 
emigrate illegally then had their corpses towed through their 
villages by a truck to terrorize the inhabitants, to discourage 
other attempts. What could I tell the mothers of the victims? 
That it was nothing? Those men must be punished. Or the 
former head of the secret police, Zylyftar Ramizi, who used to 
go to the prison every Saturday, when he had nothing else to do, 
and torture young men and women, for no reason at all, for want 
of anything better to do, a case of sheer sadism. We have had 
tens of thousands of deaths in the concentration camps, it has 
even been described as genocide, but we accuse no one of this 
crime. We do not condemn ideas, but actions. 
  [Gawronski] It looks as if you have had difficulty striking 
a 
balance between justice and vendetta. 
  [Berisha] If we had decided against trials, as other former 
communist countries have done, there would have been an 
uprising. The fact of the matter is that post-dictatorship 
societies lack charity because they are emerging from a state of 
fear and intolerance. But a symbolic form of justice at least 
is necessary to forestall vendetta, which is a cancer in society. 
  [Gawronski] Whose is the merit for the changes in Albania? 
  [Berisha] I would say that two factors played a major role: 
The first was events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, 
without which we would not even have been able to make a start. 
I remember when Gorbachev said that the USSR belonged to no 
one, whereas all the sacred texts said it belonged to the 
Communist Party. That day I was really happy: There is a man, 
I thought, who is setting himself up against the most oppressive 
instrument in all time, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. 
The pope, too, gave us fortitude and inspiration that day in 
Bari, when he prayed during a mass for "my martyred Albanian 
brothers." The second factor was economic collapse; the army 
and the secret police did not put up too much resistance because 
they knew that they would have to cope with a catastrophic 
situation. 
  [Gawronski] And is the economy doing better now? 
  [Berisha] We are still the poorest country in Europe, but we 
also have the highest growth rate, 8 percent. We have 
privatized all agriculture, and with amazing results: In some 
privileged areas, income has risen from $200 to $2,400 per year. 
Foreign investment is starting to flow in as well. I must 
admit that I believe blindly, fanatically, in the free market, 
in private initiative. You see, you live in a country where, 
more or less, the state is capable of administering what belongs 
to it, where public ownership has not given such scandalous 
results as it has here. Just think of the 600,000 bunkers that 
Hoxha built to defend Albanian territory against hypothetical 
attacks by NATO and the Warsaw Pact: completely useless, even 
in the event of an invasion, and each one cost almost as much as 
an apartment. And it would cost just as much now to demolish 
them. 
  [Gawronski] How do you explain the fact that Hoxha wanted 
to keep the country so cut off, alone against the rest? 
  [Berisha] I have given the matter a lot of thought. I think 
that, from his point of view, he was right, because he realized 
that if he had opened the country to the outside world communism 
would have collapsed immediately. He did all he could to 
isolate himself, to give annoyance. He knew what the 
destruction of a church meant to those living outside Albania, 
and he had no need to destroy it, but he did it on purpose so 
that the world would say: The man is mad, he is dangerous. 
  [Gawronski] As a matter of curiosity, is the story that you 
were his doctor true? 
  [Berisha] No, I met him a couple of times, but I never 
treated him for the sole reason that he never asked me to: I 
would have, because I would never refuse to treat a patient, 
whoever he was. 
  [Gawronski] But even now, Albania seems a bit isolated from 
the diplomatic point of view, surrounded as it is by countries 
such as Serbia, the FYROM, and Greece, with which it hardly 
enjoys excellent relations. 
  [Berisha] What worries me most is the situation in Kosovo, 
where the population is almost entirely Albanian. If the 
international community were to accept a Serb coup in Kosovo, it 
would be a tragedy for our region. Then there is Bosnia: Tough 
action is needed there, but do not ask me what, as I am not a 
military man. The leaders on the Bosnian political scene no 
longer have the power, the capacity to decide, they are too 
dependent on one another. Tough action is needed to force them 
all to accept a compromise. As to isolation, my dream is to 
integrate my country into Europe. We are at the center of 
Europe, and we feel European more than anything else. 
  [Gawronski] You are considered very pro-American. Is it true 
that you have a preference for the United States? 
  [Berisha] I consider the United States to be a stabilizing 
factor and I attach importance to its presence in Europe. I 
have met Bush, and I regard him as a great champion of freedom: 
He began his adult life fighting for freedom in the skies above 
Japan, and he left the political scene fighting for freedom in 
the communist world. Reagan, too, was a great president, a 
protagonist, like the pope, of the change in the Soviet Union. 
But as far as I am concerned, I am first and foremost 
pro-Albanian. 
  [Gawronski] And Italy? Italian aid has been accompanied by 
suspicion, disputes, and even investigations. 
  [Berisha] A distinction must be drawn between the two 
levels. 
On the humanitarian level, as regards the generosity, 
friendliness, and hospitality that the people of Puglia showed 
our compatriots at the time of the landings, I believe that 
Italy's conduct was supportive, even moving, and I am extremely 
grateful. It is the country that helped us most, but at the 
intergovernmental relations level I cannot be so lavish with 
compliments. There was Craxi, who accepted honorary membership 
of the Albanian Communist Party, our enemy, and there was the 
Italian Embassy, which had turned into a divisional Communist 
Party headquarters during the transition period between the 
former regime and the present one. And there have been lots of 
other incidents that I prefer not to discuss. I would just say 
that I am open to honest relations with honest opposite members. 
You now have the bribe city issue, and I hope that a lot of 
matters will be cleared up. I prefer to say no more.

<F P=106> ["Statement by spokesman of Albanian Foreign </F>
Ministry"--quotation marks as received] 
  [Text] Tirana, February 23 (ATA) -- The spokesman of the 
Albanian Foreign Ministry issued today a statement concerning a 
memorandum recently published by the Federative Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of the former Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro): 
  "The Foreign Ministry of Federative Republic of Yugoslavia 
(Serbia and Montenegro) recently published the so-called 
memorandum on the bordering incidents with Albania making 
deliberate endeavour to formulate absurd charges against 
Albania. Based on a typical chauvinistic Serbian logic, a very 
known one, without respecting the most natural principles, it 
says Albania is deliberately contributing in the rise of the 
incidents' number at the Albanian- Yugoslav border, seeking to 
make tensions in the relations with Yugoslavia and in order to 
find the time for taking Kosova, thus realizing the idea of the 
Greater Albania. After detailing the Serbian charges, the 
memorandum offers dialogue which is not anything else but a show 
for political consumption. The charges are similar with the 
dictators' speeches which aim to revive the blind belief of the 
people and not the truth. 
  The so-called "bordering incidents and provocations by the 
Albanian side" are known very well inside and outside Albania 
through the denunciations made by the Albanian state. According 
to the Albanian competent organs and the monitoring missions of 
European Union, the main cause of the bordering incidents have 
been the firing by the Yugoslav border guards toward the 
Albanian citizens which have not been dangerous at all having no 
arm with them. The 21 killed and wounded in the Albanian 
border, since the beginning of 1993, have been all Albanians and 
no one of has been Serbian. Naturally such acts as deliberate 
provocations and a part of the Milosevic's tension and war 
strategy will bring about unforeseen consequences. The Republic 
of Albania has stated more than once that it is not for changing 
the borders by force and Albanian bordering organs has been 
trying and are trying to respecting and well keeping the 
borders. Albania has been always preoccupied to have a quiet 
situation at the borders, to cooperate with its neighbours 
including the Yugoslav competent organs. Thus the charges made 
to Albania are intentional defamations which we reject as false 
ones. They do not speak of the Belgrade's preoccupation and a 
constructive approach in the relations with Albania but they 
seem to be the Serbia propagative campaign before starting the 
aggression on its northern borders. 
  As a democratic state, Albania not only has been openly 
declared and in a repeated way, but it is regarded as a 
stability and peace factor in the Balkans. 
  We want to remind to the Belgrade leaders that Albania for 
the very reason is for peace and stability and it is interested 
and will care for the future of the 2 millions Albanians in 
Kosova, who are not a minority as Belgrade considers them but 
they are ethnics and they live in their own land. The Albania's 
interest for them has legal basis which are sanctioned in the 
international charters. 
  It is not Albania which have caused the tense situation in 
Kosova, but it is the Serbian policy, the tanks and the presence 
of 50 thousand Serbian police and soldiers, the violence and the 
terror created by them, which has caused a tragical situation 
where even the children are deprived the right of studying in 
their native language. 
  It seems flagrant to say in that memorandum that the 
Albanians have all the rights. This is a grave defamation to 
the UN Security Council, the European Parliament, CSCE and the 
other international institutions which have ascertained through 
their documents the difficult position of the Albanian 
population in Kosova. 
  In its policy on Balkans and in its relations with the far 
and close countries, the democratic Albania has had and it has 
the purpose to serve the preserving of its state sovereignty and 
peace in the region. Albania has never been an alarming object 
for the region and Europe. Otherwise the peace-loving forces 
would have put sanctions on it and ultimatums as well. 
  The international community knows very well who are the very 
forces seeking to set the Balkans on fire and to endanger the 
peace in Europe and broader. 
  The known Belgrade's policy pursued so far in Kosova toward 
the Albanians there who live in their own land and the 
defamations and continuing charges to Albania regarding the 
openness of its foreign policy and the relations extending with 
its friend countries show clearly a pathological and 
anti-Albanian approach. 
  The politicians of the Milosevic's centralised state should 
know very well that the road toward the dialogue doesn't depend 
on the democratic Albania which has it on the basis of its 
social system. You will go to dialogue nor with preliminary 
conditions no with psychological pressure. 
  Once more the Albanian Foreign Ministry rejects the 
memorandum recently published by the Federal Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of the Federative Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and 
Montenegro). The Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers 
the memorandum as another anti-Albanian step, with a provocative 
and defamatory character. The Albanian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs makes known that about this it will fully inform the UN 
Security Council, the CSCE and the all public opinion.

  [Text] Tirana, February 26 (ATA) -- The Albanian Academy 
of Sciences condemned today, through a statement, the illegal 
and anti-scientific act of the Serbian invading authorities in 
Kosova who confiscated on February 23 the building of the Kosova 
Academy of Sciences and Arts in Prishtina. The Academy of 
Sciences of Albania regards the Serbian act as part of a 
short-sighted policy inspired by a medieval mentality. 
  The Albania's Science Academy appeals to all the world 
academies and the progressive international community to protest 
against those illegal acts in order that the Albanian scientists 
in the Republic of Kosova may freely exercise their peaceful 
activity serving the science and prosperity.

  [Text] Sofia, February 28 (BTA) -- In connection with the 
incident which led to the shooting down of warplanes near Banja 
Luka, the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry states the following: 
  The Foreign Ministry is deeply concerned over the violation 
of the United Nations "no-fly" zone declared under UN Security 
Council Resolution No. 781 (1992), No. 786 (1992) and No. 816 
(1993). The ban on military flights was part of the 
international community's efforts to find a peaceful solution to 
the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Foreign Ministry 
therefore once again calls on for a strict implementation of the 
UN security sanctions resolutions on this matter. 
  At the same time the Foreign Ministry hopes that this 
incident will not stand in the way of the peaceful settlement of 
the armed conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Sofia, February 28 (BTA) -- Yugoslavia and Bulgaria 
could play the leading role in the establishment of new 
relations in the Balkans, Belgrade's ambassador to Sofia, Mr. 
Rados Smilkovic, told the KONTINENT daily. He believes in the 
need for a new philosophy of peaceful co-existence. "The 
Balkans will either constitute a free, democratic and developed 
part of Europe or will not exist at all," he said. 
  In his opinion, the sanctions against Yugoslavia have long 
become unwarranted, as Serbs are no longer involved in the war 
in Bosnia; the war is now between Croats and Muslims and among 
Muslims themselves. Besides, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia have yet 
another thing in common: They both suffer from the embargo. 
Yugoslavia's neighbours which are most affected by the embargo 
should insist that the United Nations lift the sanctions, he 
said. 
  Yugoslavia assigns top priority to its relations with 
Bulgaria, he said. "Our relations are good, but are not up to 
the inner needs and the potential of two neighbour nations." In 
his opinion, the Bulgarian minority in Yugoslavia suffers 
relatively less from the sanctions owing to the humanitarian aid 
it receives regularly from Bulgaria and to some unspecified 
"other benefits" from life along the border. According to Mr. 
Smilkovic, there is no reason to worry about the preservation of 
the national identity of Bulgarians in Yugoslavia. "I have 
never read in the Bulgarian press that Bulgarian minorities 
anywhere enjoy more rights and are more satisfied with their 
lives," he said. 
  In an interview for STANDART NEWS in January Mr. Smilkovic 
said that Bulgarians in Yugoslavia were not many at the time the 
federation was formed and that they were embarrassed by the fact 
that they were receiving aid from Bulgaria on an ethnic basis. 
"We are sorry that we have to deny the words of the ambassador 
of the country whose citizens we happen to be," Mr. Dimitur 
Dimitrov, member of the Democratic Union of Bulgarians in 
Yugoslavia in Bosilegrad, writes in a letter to the same daily. 
Another member of that organization, Mr. Marko Shukarev from 
Tsaribrod, also denies statements of Ambassador Smilkovic in his 
interview in January. He disagrees with Mr. Smilkovic's 
assertion that the problems of the Bulgarian minority in 
Yugoslavia are needlessly politicized by the Bulgarian mass 
media. Mr. Shukarev also denies that the newspaper of the 
Bulgarian minority is no longer published because of the UN 
sanctions. Neither the Democratic Union of Bulgarians in 
Yugoslavia nor the Bulgarian newspapers are raising nonexistent 
problems, he said. Not a single problem has been settled so 
far, be it educational or religious. "Do not blame Bulgarians, 
they know what they lack!" reads the headline in STANDARD NEWS 
which carries both letters.

  [Text] Sofia, February 25 (BTA) -- Following is the full 
text of a press release which BTA received from the press centre 
of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry: 
  "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Bulgaria 
has been following closely developments in the Middle East. It 
has welcomed the positive results achieved in the 
conflict-settlement negotiations between Israel and Palestine. 
However, the fact that in the last few months enemies of the 
peace process have been stirring up tensions by terrorist acts 
against members of the Arab and Jewish communities is cause for 
serious concern. The latest tragic sanguinary incident in 
Hebron bears further evidence of the difficulties with which the 
road to a peaceful settlement is strewn. The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, while condemning this act of terrorism which caused the 
death of dozens of innocent people, expresses its conviction 
that the sensible approach will prevail and that such extremist 
acts would not invalidate the progress achieved so far and block 
the further development of the Middle East peace process."

  [Excerpts] Sofia, February 24 (BTA) -- [passage omitted] 
During a visit of BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] MP's to Serbia 
two weeks ago, Miroslav Durmov MP of the BSP proposed that the 
General Staffs of Bulgaria and Serbia draft a document for 
military control and confidence, 24 CHASA reports today. 
According to Mr. Durmov such a document is vital as Serbia has 
not signed the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. 
Belgrade showed readiness to start immediate discussion of 
confidence building measures, Gen. Miodrag Terzic of Serbia's 
Defence Ministry said, quoted by the daily. [passage omitted] 
  Within a year at the latest Bulgaria could lay territory 
claims to the present state of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], demanding first official 
protection for the Bulgarian population there, NOVINAR says 
today, quoting a high-ranking diplomat of the Foreign Ministry 
in Sofia. This dramatic reversal of Bulgaria's position towards 
Macedonia would be a consequence of Russia's increased activity 
in the Balkans, the paper adds.

<F P=106> ["Defence Minister Aleksandrov Reacts Strongly to Army </F>
Sign-In Campaign: `Stirrers Won't Be Tolerated'" -- BTA 
headline] 
  [Text] Sofia, February 28 (BTA) -- Defence Minister 
Valentin Aleksandrov reacted strongly to a sign-in campaign 
launched by members of the Rakovski Officers' Legion calling for 
higher budget appropriations for the military. "This situation 
will no longer be tolerated. Stirrers will not be tolerated in 
the Army," the defence minister said in an open letter released 
today. 
  Today's STANDART NEWS and KONTINENT reported that over the 
weekend the Defence Ministry and top state institutions were 
stricken by fear of mutiny. 
  Officers and NCO's in Khaskovo (Southern Bulgaria) launched 
a 
sign-in campaign calling on parliament to appropriate 37,500 
million leva for the 1994 defence budget. According to the 
dailies, the campaign is going on and has been supported by 
servicemen in other parts of the country. The campaign was 
discussed at a special meeting attended by the defence minister, 
deputy ministers, General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the General 
Staff, General Lilko Yotsov, the Armed Forces prosecutor, and 
other top brass. STANDART NEWS said Deputy Defence Minister 
Boyko Noev proposed that the masterminds of the campaign be 
dismissed on disciplinary grounds with immediate effect. 
According to an anonymous source quoted in KONTINENT, "the 
initiators avoided arrest by a hair's breadth." Aleksandrov 
briefed President Zhelev and Prime Minister Berov on the 
situation in the Army. STANDART NEWS said President Zhelev tried 
to calm down the Defence Ministry leaders saying this was hardly 
an organized mutiny. He called on them to seek ways to clear the 
matter up with the initiators of the sign-in campaign who, 
according to the President, demanded from politicians the same 
as the leaders of the Defence Ministry. 
  In today's letter the defence minister said the Rakovski 
Legion had organized several sign-in campaigns in breach of the 
Armed Forces' statute. "Those who want an increase in the 
defence budget through sign-in campaigns and statements, knowing 
that their claims are absurd in the current difficult period, 
are taking undue advantage of the common interests of the 
military and are driving the Army to instability and 
politicization," the defence minister says. According to him, 
"in their attempt to protect their own interests, the organizers 
and fomenters of the campaign are ready to oppose the Army to 
society." 
  "The leadership of the Rakovski Officers' Legion is being 
manipulated for political purposes," Aleksandrov says. 
  Today's STANDART NEWS quoted the Legion's leaders who 
denounced "attempts to ascribe political ambitions to the 
`Khaskovo initiative.'"

  [Text] Sofia, February 28 (BTA) -- Parliament passed the 
1994 national budget bill after five-day debates. The MP's 
voted for 100,167 million leva in revenues, 133,836.6 million 
leva in expenditures, and a deficit amounting to 33,699.6 
million leva. Revenues are up some 30 million leva, 
expenditures nearly 35 million leva and the deficit 6 million 
leva from last year. To pass the budget by the end of February, 
the MP's worked through the week-end and held a 12-hour 
extraordinary sitting today. 
  They voted to raise the revenue figure to 100,167 million 
leva, up 280 million leva from the cabinet-sponsored one. The 
margin will be covered by revenues from special extrabudgetary 
accounts. 
  The expenditure figure has been raised to 133,836.6 million 
leva, up 300 million leva from the first reading. More money 
will be allocated to research institutions, the Bulgarian State 
Railways (the national railway carrier), to extrabudgetary 
funds, etc., yet most figures were not changed. A total of 
18,859.1 million leva have been voted for defence and security. 
Some 6,350 million leva have been budgeted to subsidize 
money-losing producers, the import of coal for domestic users, 
etc. 
  The legislators voted for a social security budget of 
58,151.7 million leva, including 52,804 million leva from social 
security tax and a government transfer of 5,347.4 million leva. 
The increase from last year amounts to some 20 million leva. 
  Government departments get 42,411.9 million leva. 
Parliament, the President's Office and the cabinet will take 
cuts of 35 million leva, 5 million leva and 15 million leva from 
the original draft figures. 40 million leva of that money will 
be reoriented to health, 10 million leva to the Unions of War 
Veterans and the Blind, and 5 million leva to the Agency for 
Bulgarians Abroad. The Defence Ministry budget is set at 11,600 
million leva, the Interior Ministry budget at 5,600 million leva 
and the National Intelligence Service budget at 131.6 million. 
A total of 3,900 million leva is allocated for the needs of 
health care and another 7,500 million for education. 
  The subsidies to be extended to the municipalities amount to 
18,243,596,000 leva. 
  The report on the utilization of the 1992 national budget, 
which figured in the bill, was not put to the vote after the 
MP's backed Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's proposal to exclude it 
from the debates. 
  "This is the most constricted budget for the past four years 
and it will have a lot of adverse effects," Parliamentary Budget 
Committee Chairman Ventsislav Dimitrov said on the behalf of the 
Union of the Democratic Forces (SDS) parliamentary group. He 
stressed the disparity between the SDS stand on the state 
financial policy and the views of the parliamentary majority on 
this matter. According to MP's of the SDS, the unfeasible 
macro-economic framework is most likely to fail the budget 
within mid-1994. The SDS cannot assume the political 
responsibility for the budget, Mr. Dimitrov also said. 
  Speaking on the behalf of his parliamentary group, Mr. 
Nikolay Koychev MP of the Bulgarian Socialist Party hailed the 
passage of the 1994 national budget in the last day of February. 
Last year it (the budget) was passed in June, Mr. Koychev 
recalled. According to the BSP parliamentary group, this is the 
only budget this country could have. 
  The MP's of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) and 
the New Union for Democracy (NSD), too, backed most of the texts 
in the 1994 national budget bill. The NSD, however, denounced 
the procedure on the passage of the budget and said it should 
come only after a wholesale national policy on the economic 
reforms has been considered. 
  "I hope that the Cabinet will disprove the pessimistic 
predictions about the 1994 budget," Finance Minister Stoyan 
Aleksandrov said after the passage of the 1994 budget bill.

  [Text] Prague, March 1 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Ministry 
said Tuesday [1 March] it considers the radical and effective 
strike of NATO air force against Galeb combat aircraft in Bosnia 
to be an important step in the direction of respecting the 
decision of the U.N. Security Council on no-fly zone in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina. 
  The statement, handed to CTK, says that after the recent 
NATO 
ultimatum which contributed to the removal of heavy weaponry 
from Sarajevo and its surroundings, the alliance has again shown 
a determination to create conditions necessary for political 
talks on resolving the crisis. 
  The ministry holds the view that those forces who sent the 
combat aircraft, thus trying to expand the warfare from ground 
to air, are responsible for the use of military power in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, says the statement. 
  The ministry voiced the hope that the shooting down of the 
Galeb aircraft will not provoke attempts to retaliate against 
the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Froces] troops. Should this 
development occur, a previous decision of the U.N. Security 
Council on the protection of the UNPROFOR troops, including the 
possible use of the air force, should be implemented, the 
statement says.

  [Text] Prague Feb 28 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry 
was shocked at the news of a terrible massacre of Palestinian 
Moslems in Hebron, the ministry said in a statement given to CTK 
by Spokesman Vit Kurfurst on Monday [28 February]. 
  It is the task for all parties involved in the conflict and 
the whole international community to prevent the repetition of 
such tragic events which lead to further escalation of violence 
and could become an insurmountable obstacle for the current 
promising procedure of peace talks, the statement says. 
  The Foreign Ministry hopes that all parties involved, 
carried 
by responsibility for the possible loss of other human lives, 
will resort to intensive talks as soon as possible which would 
lead to achieving just, permanent and comprehensive peaceful 
solution, Kurfurst said. 
  At least 50 people were killed in Friday's attack by a 
Jewish 
settler against Moslems in the holy complex Tombs of the 
Prophets in the town of Hebron on the occupied West Bank of the 
River Jordan. It is the largest massacre since 1967 when the 
West Bank and Gaza zone were occupied by Israel. 
  The massacre provoked protest demonstrations in Israel and 
around countries. The Israeli Government ordered that leaders of 
the extremist Jewish organisation Kach to which the attacker 
belonged be arrested. The majority of European countries were 
shocked by the massacre and expressed concern about the future 
of the peace process. The United Nations Security Council is to 
take a definitive stand on the event at its session today.

  [Text] Prague Feb 28 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec met with Speaker of the Polish Sejm (parliament) Jozef 
Oleksy on Monday [28 February] to discuss the questions of 
European security, integration into the European structures and 
the course of transformation in the Czech Republic and Poland. 
Oleksy has been on a three-day visit to the Czech Republic 
since Sunday [27 February]. 
  The two politicians expressed satisfaction over good 
relations between Poland and the Czech Republic. Oleksy showed 
interest in the Czech Republic's efforts at integrating in 
Europe and in its opinion of the NATO Partnership for Peace 
initiative as well as on its relation to NATO and the European 
Union. 
  Zieleniec voiced the view that countries attempting at 
joining these institutions should first become fully ready. 
  The two countries' relations toward Russia and Ukraine and 
the possibility for these countries' participation in European 
structures and the future European security system were also 
discussed. Zieleniec and Oleksy also paid attention to the 
regional cooperation which embraces, along with cultural and 
economic relations, also cooperation in some political problems.

  [Text] Budapest, February 28 (MTI) -- "The Foreign 
Ministry of the Republic of Hungary was shocked to learn about 
the suicidal action that claimed nearly 70 victims in Hebron's 
Ibrahimi mosque," a Foreign Ministry communique sent to MTI 
today stated. "In keeping with the deep sympathy expressed by 
the Hungarian general public, we wish to express our condolence 
to the victims' relatives," the statement says. 
  Concerning the February 25 massacre, the document says: "The 
Hungarian Foreign Ministry sees the event as a common tragedy 
for both peoples, the direct consequences of which may 
unfortunately affect, but hopefully not deadlock, the promising 
Middle East peace talks. 
  "However, it is a necessity for the peace process to 
continue 
with success, so that in the future there should be no similarly 
senseless acts of violence aimed at putting an end to 
negotiations based on common will." 
  "It is cause for concern that there is a dangerous 
escalation 
of violent reactionary actions and vengeances being committed by 
both opposing sides in the area under Israeli occupation." 
  "The Hungarian Foreign Ministry holds the position that in 
this painful hour all sides involved in the peace talks should 
display increased self-restraint." 
  "It is particularly important that both the PLO and the 
Israeli Government should spare no effort to control extremist 
organizations and persons prepared to commit similar acts of 
violence. They should be neutralized as soon as possible in a 
form coordinated and accepted by both sides." 
  "We are convinced that the extremely complex Mideast issue 
can only be solved through compromise and negotiations aimed at 
creating peace, security, cooperation and peaceful coexistence 
in the region. 
  "We hope that the peace process will put an end to the 
decades-long conflict, create stability in the region, and 
enforce both the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and 
the right to security for the State of Israel."

  [Text] Budapest, 28 Feb (MTI) -- "Hungary's prestige 
abroad has improved over the past four years," Hungarian Prime 
Minister Peter Boross said on Hungarian Television tonight. 
  The prime minister illustrated his statement, among other 
things, with the fact that half of foreign direct investment in 
East Central Europe landed in Hungary, whose inhabitants make up 
merely 10 percent of the population of the region. 
  Replying to viewers' questions about Hungary's relations 
with 
its neighbours, Boross said that the talks on concluding basic 
treaties with these states should focus on improving the 
situation and enforcing the rights of ethnic Hungarian 
minorities rather than declaring the existing borders again. 
  As for minority rights, Boross termed the implementation of 
the Council of Europe recommendations as a priority. "On this 
basis, we can negotiate on other issues, too," he said. 
  Asked about Hungary's recent opening towards Serbia, the 
prime minister said, "there lives a large community of ethnic 
Hungarians in Vojvodina. We must maintain goodneighbourly ties 
with Serbia even in the future. We cannot wait until the 
weapons become silent. If we can pave the way for a peaceful 
settlement and the solution of disputed issues through 
negotiations, we must not hesitate," he said. 
  Addressing home policy issues, Boross ruled out the 
possibility of any coalition to be formed between his party, the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum, and the largest party of the 
parliamentary opposition, the Alliance of Free Democrats, after 
the May elections. 
  "Even a deadlock might emerge after the elections, with no 
parties being able to form a parliamentary majority. In this 
hypothetical situation, the best solution would be the calling 
of new elections," the prime minister said.

  [Text] Budapest, 26 February (MTI) -- "It represents a 
unique condition in Europe that 35 percent of Hungarians live 
outside the parent country, in the neighboring countries. As a 
result, Hungary has disputes with its neighbors, but these are 
not as serious as those in the Balkans or the Caucasus," Prime 
Minister Peter Boross said this evening in his reception toast 
for participants in the conference of DEMYC, the union of 
European center-right parties' youth organizations. DEMYC is 
holding its executive committee session in Budapest from Friday 
[25 February] to Sunday [27 February]. 
  Boross said debates with neighbors involve human rights 
issues, such as use of the Hungarian language in official 
contacts, the right to native-language education or the right 
and possibility of using originally Hungarian geographical 
names. He added Hungary is nonetheless developing economic and 
cultural ties with its neighbors, and that the disputes do not 
threaten Europe in any way. 
  DEMYC President Klaus Welle, head of the German CDU's 
[Christian Democratic Union] European Policy Department, said 
some in the West think that Eastern and Western European 
countries should be separated. The young conservatives and 
Christian democrats reject this view, and support their joint 
participation in NATO, the European Union, the Western European 
Union, and other institutions. Hungary has won the right to do 
so also by its minority policy, Welle said.

  [Text] Budapest, 23 February (MTI) -- "Fostering good 
relations with neighboring states and protecting the rights of 
the Hungarian minority living beyond the country's borders are 
inseparable tasks in Hungarian foreign policy. There is no point 
in debating which is more important," Hungarian Foreign Minister 
Geza Jeszenszky said in Budapest on Wednesday [23 February] at a 
session of Parliament's Human Rights Committee. 
  He went on to say that "a good relationship with our 
neighbors is inconceivable in places where the minorities are 
oppressed, on the other hand, settling the situation of national 
minorities naturally brings an improvement in relations." 
  As regards Slovakia, Jeszenszky said Budapest has committed 
itself to a Hungarian-Slovak compromise, although this is 
inconceivable without protection for Hungarians living in 
Slovakia. Jeszenszky noted with regret that his visit to 
Slovakia, which he hoped would clarify many hotly debated issues 
and which was planned for last autumn, did not come about. 
  One of the issues which torpedoed the visit was Slovakia's 
binding of an earlier agreed-upon opening of new border stations 
to a deportation agreement that was unacceptable for Hungary. 
  Hungary took a reserved position when Slovakia became a 
member of the Council of Europe, advancing its goodwill to 
Bratislava. However, events of the past months have not 
justified this advance confidence. 
  According to the foreign minister, the greater part of 
Slovak 
society would prefer good relations with Hungary and is inclined 
to settle the minority situation. However, it is very difficult 
to represent sobriety against the nationalistic emotions whipped 
up in Slovakia. 
  The Hungarian Government continues to be ready for 
compromises, and Budapest expects someone to grasp its extended 
hand. Hungary calls for both bilateral and multilateral 
minority protection agreements. 
  The foreign minister also said the best solution would be 
for 
the legislatures of the countries concerned to themselves enact 
internal laws for the protection of minorities. Such legal 
measures could ensure bilingual education, and the use of the 
mother language in public administration. 
  Jeszenszky voiced his regret over the fact that no such 
legal 
measures have been created in Slovakia, Romania, or Yugoslavia. 
He indicated that he is ready to hold talks about tasks related 
to minority protection legislation with the neighboring 
countries, and Hungary does not insist on the "principle of 
reciprocity."

  [Text] Krakow, Feb. 23 -- Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski in his address to the inaugural session of the 
Polish-Russian conference "Towards a New Partnership" in Krakow 
on Wednesday presented a "Partnership for Transformation", the 
new initiative on cooperation between Poland and Russia. 
  Speaking at the conference, organised by the foundation of 
the International Centre for the Development of Democracy and 
attended by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Olechowski 
said that this cooperation is designed to secure Poland and 
Russia a "worthy place in the group of highly developed 
democratic states." Olechowski explained that the key issue of 
this partnership will be a better use of traditional trade ties 
in order to fill in the vacuum left after the dissolution of the 
Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. 
  Olechowski claimed that Poland and Russia should support 
each 
other in creating new trade law, compatible with international 
standards, form a system of bilateral trade preferences and 
cooperate in the development of banking and transport services. 
He added that Poland has drawn up the concept of an East 
European trade initiative aimed at organising such cooperation. 
  The Polish minister noted that stabilization of the 
situation 
in the region would be assisted by the Partnership for Peace 
project as well as the development of bilateral and multilateral 
cooperation on many planes. 
  In his address to the conference, Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev presented a new Russian initiative of 
all-European partnership. Kozyrev claimed that this partnership 
should be based on the hitherto cooperation within the framework 
of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). 
According to the minister, the political and military 
cooperation should be concentrated within the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council which would coordinate the efforts of NATO, 
the European Union, the Council of Europe, the Western European 
Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  The Russian politician stressed the necessity to strengthen 
cooperation within the North Atlantic Council and to implement 
the "Partnership for Peace" initiative on an equal footing. 
Kozyrev emphasized that Russia's security guarantees would be 
included in the all-European partnership plan, along with 
guarantees extended by western European states. 
  Kozyrev noted that if only some states of Central and East 
Europe were admitted to NATO, this could create new political 
barriers and make Russia take countermeasures, especially if 
this led to Russia's isolation. 
  Speaking to reporters during a press conference held after 
their talks Wednesday, both ministers said they had largely 
convergent views on questions of European security. Olechowski 
added, however, that the talks had revealed differences 
concerning the road leading to that security. 
  Kozyrev declared Russia would join the Partnership for Peace 
project, but this would take some time. Olechowski said that an 
effective system of European security had to include Russia, 
irrespective of whether NATO existed or not. 
  Kozyrev said the recent arrest in the United States of a 
high-ranking CIA staffer charged with spying for the USSR and 
Russia would not undermine the partnerly relations between 
Russia and the USA. 
  The Russian minister dismissed statements by Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy as unimportant, saying he did not represent anyone 
in Russia. 
  Kozyrev confirmed he had accepted an invitation to pay an 
official visit to Poland. The present two-day stay in Krakow 
was a working visit which ended Wednesday.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 24 -- Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski told reporters upon the return of the Polish 
delegation from Latvia on Thursday that economic contacts "along 
with broadly understood supplies of the arms industry" were the 
main topics of talks of the Polish delegation accompanying 
President Lech Walesa. He stressed that Poland has placed 
Latvia and the other Baltic countries among top priorities of 
the Polish eastern policy. 
  He disclosed that he and his Latvian counterpart Georgs 
Andrejevs discussed the possibility of creating a promotion 
centre for the three Baltic countries in Gdansk in the near 
future. According to Olechowski, Polish-Latvian trade exchange 
is insufficient at present, especially that Latvia has already 
regulated its currency issues and there are no problems in 
mutual payments. 
  Rear Admiral Romuald Waga, commander-in-chief of the Polish 
Navy, told reporters that his talks with the defence minister of 
Latvia focused on Polish technical assistance for Latvian Armed 
Forces in organizing communications and trainings. He disclosed 
that the sale of Polish arms to Latvia in exchange for the 
overhaul of marine engines in Latvian shipyards is also being 
considered. Reporters learned that Latvia was interested in the 
purchase of naval guns.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 25/2/1994 -- "Any government in 
Romania must be a government for reform, and this necessarily 
implies a wide political and social support," President Ion 
Iliescu of Romania told the daily newspaper ADEVARUL. Asked 
whether he had any preferences for the government to be 
appointed after 1 March, the president of Romania said that he, 
personally, had no preference, and that he would like "a 
government enjoying some stability and enough parliamentary 
support." He underlined the distinction that should be made 
between "a political agreement between the political parties 
forming the parliament" and the "possible structure of a 
government." In this latter case a government, the president 
opined, "could be formed solely of technocrats or of 
representatives of a single political party, but only based on a 
political formula of a wider parliamentary support." 
  About the much vented version of holding early elections, 
Romania's number one said that such an alternative would not be 
the best for Romania, because an election campaign at the moment 
would only "disturb public life." However, theoretically 
speaking, early elections "could be a solution unless others are 
found." President Iliescu's opinion is that in 1994 the 
Romanian society should concentrate its efforts on surmounting 
the crisis and on economic reconstruction. "No matter what 
governments will succeed one another, Romania's problems will be 
the same," the president of Romania said. 
  As already widely reflected by the press, President Ion 
Iliescu had consultations with all the parliamentary parties 
with the aim of reaching a political pact aimed at reinstating a 
climate for dialogue between the political forces and at 
building a minimal common platform for taking the economic 
reform further. The first round of consultations ended in 
mid-January. Their resumption depends on the joint agreement of 
all parties involved.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 28/2/1994 -- In an interview 
with daily COTIDIANUL, Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu 
said with reference to the previous statements on the 
possibility of making up a new government by March 1, 1994, that 
"the political dialogue continues. The final decision on a 
possible government reshuffle will depend also on these 
demarches that result from the political dialogue but, first, it 
will depend on the decision to make or not make a reshuffle and 
on establishing the persons to replace the present dignitaries. 
As long as I am the prime minister I am not starting from the 
idea of a reshuffle for the sake of reshuffle." 
  Referring to the government's reform program, he said that 
"the strategy we have articulated, including the program of 
measures and actions for 1994 has an anti-crisis character. It 
has nothing new, actually stemming from the government's 
strategy. "Sure," he added, "it is a program of the (ruling) 
party of Social Democracy of Romania, on which all ministries 
worked, especially that most ministers are members of this 
party. Besides, the problem of a dialogue was posed and this 
seems very fair to me, with the parties that backed the 
government in 1993, concerning a string of objectives included 
in this program. The outlook differs in some respects. 
However, there is a point that unites us and on which we can 
agree, I mean especially the social protection."

  [Text] In a communique issued today the Romanian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs states that it has noted with satisfaction 
the fact that -- with the considerable contribution of the U.S. 
Administration -- an accord was concluded on the establishment 
of a Croatian-Muslim federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and a 
confederation between the latter and Croatia. 
  Romania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that the 
implementation of the stipulations of the aforementioned accord 
represents a substantial step toward the political settlement of 
the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, parallel to efforts made to 
find solutions for the rest of the package of issues that is 
being negotiated. 
  Romania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses the hope 
that 
this favorable moment will be turned to good account to the 
benefit of all parties and stability and security in the region, 
the communique concludes.

  [Text] The [Romanian] League for the Protection of Human 
Rights [LADO] and the Civic Alliance [AC] -- the organizations 
that sent groups of observers to monitor the [27 February] 
parliamentary elections in the Republic of Moldova -- found a 
number of violations of the electoral law, which they presented 
yesterday during a news conference held in Bucharest. 
  From among those irregularities, the list of which has been 
faxed to us, we mention the following: the broadcasting, on the 
eve of elections, of two speeches made by President Mircea 
Snegur, as the speeches doubtlessly had an electoral character; 
a number of cases in which votes were cast while more than one 
person was present in the ballot booths; a number of cases when 
votes were cast outside ballot booths; attempts made at certain 
polling stations to influence the voters; and the nonregistering 
of persons who had already voted, which allowed for the same 
persons to cast two or even more votes.

  [Text] A rapid development of political events can 
presently be seen both at home and abroad, in our close 
vicinity, said Ioan Solcanu, deputy chairman of Social Democracy 
Party of Romania [PDSR], during a news conference held today. 
  We salute the first free multiparty elections held [on 27 
February] in the Republic of Moldova, which, according to 
observers, were organized under optimal circumstances, despite 
certain minor incidents. We hope that the new framework will 
allow for the assertion, without any obstructions, of the 
democratic principles, and that also includes telling the truth 
about the history of the [Moldova] territory and native 
population. 
  During the news conference Solcanu also referred to the 
talks 
held by PDSR with PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party] and 
PD-FSN [Democratic Party-National Salvation Front]. During the 
talks held with PUNR the two parties found that in the current 
political context the protocol signed [on 1 February] remains 
valid, although it cannot be implemented literally, but merely 
in its spirit. Talking about the consultations with PD-FSN, 
Solcanu assessed that a step forward has been made, as they 
reviewed the goals pursued by the two political parties in the 
current dialogue. That is important because PDSR is involved in 
talks with other parties as well, including parties belonging to 
the Democratic Convention of Romania and those of the current 
parliamentary coalition. Solcanu stressed that they discussed 
aspects of a possible moratorium between PDSR and PD-FSN, which 
could contribute to the continuation of the dialogue between the 
two parties, ease the current strain in the political life, and 
offer elements needed for a possible future cooperation in 
parliament. 
  All political parties have to act with responsibility and 
make efforts to find the convergent points to surmount the 
current situation, concluded Solcanu.

  [Text] [Hungarian Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky has 
said that Hungary sincerely supports the Croatian-Muslim 
reconciliation because these two nations are dependent on each 
other more than other countries of the region. The Hungarian 
foreign minister, who is currently holding talks in Washington, 
is of the opinion that, if the canton system enabling the 
coexistence of Croats and Muslims comes into prominence again in 
the case of Bosnia, the example, in a wider sense, will probably 
be followed elsewhere as well.

<F P=106> [Report by Attila Kert and Kata Peli Nagy] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Peli Nagy] The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] 
wants society's trust and support to build a better Hungary; 
this is how Gyula Horn, party chairman, closed the party 
congress. The vast majority of delegates accepted the party's 
list without changes. The first person on the list is Party 
Chairman Gyula Horn followed by Sandor Nagy, chairman of the 
MSZOSZ [National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions], and 
Laszlo Bekesi, responsible for the party's economic policy. 
  On the list containing 174 names, 11 people represent trade 
unions, eight are members of the Left-Wing Youth Association, 
and three represent the National Federation of Pensioners. 
According to the decision of the party's executive, only those 
who conclude a political agreement with the party can run in the 
colors and with the support of the MSZP. The point of this is 
that later, if a person happens to leave the party's 
parliamentary group, he or she will also have to resign his or 
her mandate. 
  Matyas Szueroes, deputy speaker of the National Assembly, 
decided to keep his place on the national list. [passage 
omitted] 
  In the political debate Bekesi sharply criticized the 
present 
government's ideas regarding bank privatization and its 
overspending from the budget. He blamed the government for 
sacrificing agriculture and for carrying out privatization on 
ideological grounds. At the moment, the foreign debt amounts to 
$24.5 billion and the internal debt is 3 trillion forints. 
According to Bekesi, the increase of real wages this year and 
next year cannot be expected. 
  Talking about the internal arguments of the party, Bekesi 
said if the MSZP would win the elections or would come second, 
it would not be able to avoid governing and preparations should 
be made for a social-liberal coalition now. 
  [Kert] The MSZP would not join a future government at any 
price, Horn said. The Socialists' condition is that the future 
coalition partners agree on the necessity of a social pact. In 
the interest of easing the economic crisis they should be 
willing to continue, what is more, to speed up compensation 
process, to create a venture-friendly environment and to support 
agriculture with encouraging credit and trade policies. If we 
could not fulfill our promises we would step aside, Horn said in 
ending his closing speech.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F>
Socialist Party, by an unidentified announcer -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Announcer] You still do not 
have a prime ministerial candidate. At the same time you do have 
a candidate for president of the Republic. This is a fairly 
peculiar situation. To top it all off, you have a candidate for 
president of the Republic at a time when the liberal parties, to 
the best of my knowledge, have not yet said who is their 
candidate for president of the Republic. 
  [Horn] That is their affair. We thought that not only is 
Arpad Goncz a generally respected figure, but the country has a 
great deal to thank him for, from the point of view of the fact 
that it has been possible to safeguard peace in the very 
difficult and complex process of the transformation. It is our 
conviction that there is no alternative to Arpad Goncz in this 
position today. 
  As far as the candidate for prime minister is concerned, it 
really is not a case of tactics. But we are of the view that 
first of all we shall have to see the election results - because 
at present they are unpredictable; and on the other hand, at the 
congress yesterday we adopted a package of demands, a system of 
conditions, whereby if the HSP finds itself in that sort of 
situation, it would negotiate with the possible coalition 
partners. Now, if we were to commit ourselves in advance on the 
issue of the prime minister candidate, let us say, then that 
would make the negotiations more difficult. We are open in this 
respect, and what we say is that those people should get into 
government posts who are decent and the most qualified 
professionally, regardless of what party they belong to.

<F P=106> ["Statement by deputies of the former Grand National </F>
Assembly who refused to sign the Constitution and declared a 
hunger strike in 1991, adopted at a meeting in Blagoevgrad on 19 
and 20 February 1994"] 
  [Text] The following persons were present when the 
document was made public: Aleksandur Dzherov, Aleksandur 
Yordanov, Aleksandur Pramatarski, Aleksandur Chirkov, Aleksandur 
Yanchulev, Andrey Avramov, Vladislav Daskalov, Vladimir Manolov, 
Ventseslav Medarski, Ventseslav Dimitrov, Vasil Kostov, Georgi 
Lipovanski, Georgi Markov, Georgi Petrov, Dimitur Topliyski,

Eskenazi, Mikhail Nedelchev, Nikolay Slatinski, Pavel Mazulov, 
Spas Dimitrov, Snezhana Botusharova, Stefan Savov, Todor Kolev, 
and Khristo Markov. 
  In Blagoevgrad on 19 and 20 February 1994, a meeting was 
held 
of people's deputies who, by their boycott of parliament and 
refusal to sign the Constitution, contributed very greatly to 
the victory of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] in the 
elections to the 36th National Assembly. 
  This was a meeting of people of like mind who were and are 
united in the struggle against the Communist Party. Having 
preserved human relations between one another and united under 
the motto: "I am not a Communist and will never be one,..." we 
shared our alarm and concern for the fate of democracy in 
Bulgaria. 
  In Bulgaria an active process of recommunization is under 
way, and the most retrograde circles of the former Communist 
Party are increasingly raising their heads. At the meeting we 
shared information about the intention of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] to undertake actions in parliament before 
the elections aimed at repealing the main laws on restitution, 
chiefly those regarding town property. At the same time, it is 
expected that the process of the return of farmland to its 
owners will be halted and blocked throughout the country. 
According to reliable data, an open attempt is being made to 
take control of the judiciary, and then the Constitutional 
Court. Information coming in from all over the country shows 
that preparations are being made to settle accounts everywhere 
with SDS members and sympathizers, which includes dismissals 
from jobs for political reasons. 
  We are even more alarmed by the fact that BSP circles are 
preparing to strike against all democratic forces in the country 
by adopting a new electoral law. They continue their attacks 
against SDS-controlled local authorities, blocking their work 
and trying to eliminate them before the elections. Recently 
they have been holding numerous meetings and talks with high 
state officials at which they openly discuss ways to deal a blow 
against the parliamentary system. At the same time, we cannot 
fail to look the truth in the eye and see that thousands and 
millions of people in Bulgaria are living in even greater 
poverty and hardship under the fear of the increasing crime rate. 
  The entire responsibility for all of this falls upon the 
unreformed BSP -- the opponent of the democratic processes in 
Bulgaria -- and on the leaders for whom the word communist 
continues to be sacred. Even today, this party -- the chief 
culprit responsible for Bulgaria's national disaster -- 
continues to rule Bulgaria. 
  In this complex and exceptionally demanding situation, the 
issue arises of the unity of the SDS and of dialogue with all 
noncommunist political and trade-union organizations in 
Bulgaria. The SDS should form the basis and motive force for 
the democratic process, and not become a place for personal 
attacks, intrigues, and seeking "the enemy within the party," 
like the Bolsheviks. 
  In the period left before the early parliamentary elections, 
the SDS parliamentary group must devote all its efforts to 
preventing the success of the attempts at recommunizing 
Bulgaria. The SDS parliamentary group must defend the most 
precious achievements of democracy achieved through the laws 
passed by the SDS. It must continue to work actively on the new 
SDS program and make its contribution toward solving people's 
everyday problems. 
  While defending democracy in parliament, at the same time 
the 
SDS should start mobilizing and organizing its forces to demand 
and win the future elections by actions within and outside 
parliament. 
  The participants in the meeting are convinced that all 
efforts must be made to ensure that the SDS wins the elections 
and assumes the responsibility for ruling the country.

<F P=106> ["Statement by Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy on </F>
the position adopted by the Group of 39, issued by the Press 
Center of the Bulgarian Socialist Party"; date not given] 
  [Text] The Press Center of the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
[BSP] and the Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy [PSSD] is 
authorized to issue the following statement: 
  At present the Group of 39 [deputies of the former Grand 
National Assembly who refused to sign the new Constitution in 
1991] is attempting, through the agency of the chairman of the 
National Assembly, to cast on the BSP the guilt for its own 
grave crimes as regards the democratic changes in Bulgaria. It 
was the extremist actions of the Union of Democratic Forces 
(SDS) following the Varna meeting of the Group of 39 two years 
ago that led to the blocking of the agrarian reform, the 
repoliticization of the judiciary, the escalation of political 
persecution, and the transformation of property restitution into 
total restoration of the old state of affairs. 
  Then the SDS used slanders and insinuations against the BSP 
as alibis in the eyes of Bulgaria and the world. Today, 
however, nothing can conceal the brazen sabotage of the state's 
power that is being carried out by the highly paid bureaucrats 
foisted on the state by the SDS. 
  This latest hysterical propaganda campaign against the BSP 
cannot distract attention from the grave situation within the 
blue [SDS] coalition. The intrigues that each person in the SDS 
is pursuing against all the rest, including through election 
barriers, lists of deputies, and bargaining in the lobbies, are 
today a public secret. They cannot be camouflaged by the 
ostensible anticommunism displayed by guilty dabblers in 
politics. 
  It is high time that the SDS stopped engrossing society in 
its own political degradation, as it leaves the problems that it 
has itself created for others to solve. The cheap demagogy of 
the SDS deputies will not relieve them of their responsibility 
for Bulgaria's collapse.

<F P=106> ["Statement by the executive leadership of the </F>
Constitutional Forum on the Macedonian question"; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] The Constitutional Forum has always followed a 
policy of maintaining close contact with Bulgarians abroad, 
defending their interests as a matter of principle, and using 
their efforts to surmount the crisis that our fatherland is 
experiencing. 
  Taking account of the historical truth concerning Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], the 
Constitutional Forum categorically rejects the Serbian and 
Komintern thesis of Macedonianism and, in conformance with the 
facts of history, declares that the Slavs in Macedonia are 
native [prirodni] Bulgarians. 
  We are distressed, however, to have to confirm that the 
agents of authority representing the Bulgarian state continue to 
handle the Macedonian question in the spirit of the Komintern 
doctrines. In this connection, the Constitutional Forum demands 
the following: 
  -- Reestablishment of the historical truth concerning the 
Bulgarian nature and origin of the Slavs in Macedonia. The 
president, parliament, and government should issue declarations 
to this effect and mount an international campaign to defend the 
national rights of our compatriots. 
  -- Opposition by diplomatic means to the pressure being 
applied to Macedonia by Greece and Serbia to ensure the 
possibility for the state of Macedonia to develop in peace. 
  We are convinced that the democratic Bulgarian public is 
bound to defend the historical interests of the Bulgarian 
national spirit in Macedonia, while our state guards against a 
settlement of the Macedonia question by the use of force. 
  We call upon the mass media to handle the Macedonian 
question 
in conformance with the historical truth.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Andrey Apostolov: "Alas, the Bear Is Not </F>
Dead Yet!"] 
  [Text] One week after Russia's Sarajevo initiative 
obliterated NATO's ultimatum and confused the plans of certain 
eastern and western capitals, Moscow claims that it has come out 
of the three year-period during which it used to lethargically 
bow to the West and indicates that it will not stand in front of 
Brussels' gates as Henry IV used to in front of the gates of 
Canossa. 
  With his address to the Federal Assembly, President Yeltsin 
certainly gained points in Russia, which still awaits the 
billions the West promised. This is the first time that Moscow 
has warned the West in such a categorical manner that the time 
of unilateral concessions, especially regarding defense, is over 
and that expanding NATO without its participation would be a 
threat to Europe and the world. This could only mean one thing 
for NATO's East European candidates -- they will have to wait. 
Apparently, the period of waiting will be a long one. 
  The "a-la-Zhirinovskiy" style, with which the president 
declared that a priority task will be to strengthen the state 
and prompt it to act firmly and decisively when the state 
interests require this, will obviously be a leading style of 
Russian policy. This was not a mere implication but a threat to 
NATO and those neighbors who have written Russia off as a great 
power. Now they will have to get used to the formula of 
"protecting the Russian citizens' life and interests." A 
similar formula in the last 40 years sent U.S. troops to the 
Dominican Republic, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, and many other 
places. The Russians do not have to go that far to send their 
troops. After all, their troops already are in Georgia, 
Tajikistan, the Baltic states, and so on. 
  The Western capitals probably watched Yeltsin's address, 
which was directly carried by CNN, and even more probably, they 
were unpleasantly surprised. The dying bear was brought back to 
life and it appears that it did not forget how to jump.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nora Ananieva, chairperson of the Bulgarian </F>
Socialist Party parliamentary faction, by Dora Chichkova; place 
and date not given: "No Parties or Persons Should Impose 
Themselves in Balkans"] 
  [Text] [Chichkova] Certain commentaries on your visit to 
Serbia contain the clear accusation that the visit took place at 
an inappropriate time, and that the opinions you expressed there 
do not coincide with the official attitude of the Bulgarian 
Government toward our western neighbor. Actually, what was the 
purpose of your visit? 
  [Ananieva] The parliamentary delegation of the 
Parliamentarian Alliance for Social Democracy visited 
Dimitrovgrad, Belgrade, and Novi Sad on 7-8 February at the 
invitation of the Serbian Socialist Party. If your question 
implies that we have deliberately selected the date of the 
visit, in other words, that we selected on purpose the brief 
period between two events that focused the attention and efforts 
of the entire world -- the sinister massacre in Sarajevo and the 
ensuing decision on air strikes against Bosnia, which is torn 
apart by the civil war -- I am tempted to answer in the 
affirmative. If this was so, then we could claim supernatural 
intuition, incredible information, and great organizational 
abilities. However, I will not succumb to this temptation and 
will only say that it is the constant position of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] the dialogue between all forces should 
never stop, and that this especially applies to crisis 
situations, when specific decision related to national interests 
are required. In all my public appearances I expressed the 
official Bulgarian position regarding the observance of the 
sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council. However, this 
position does not contradict the doubt whether the pressure 
applied in this manner on the rulers of any state could justify, 
for such a long period, the suffering and deprivation of such 
broad circles of the population in so many countries, including 
Bulgaria. This is especially true against the background of the 
voices that were heard recently regarding the need to review the 
instrument of sanctions. People ever more frequently ask the 
question of whether the sanctions achieve the anticipated effect 
and of who is actually paying the price? In other words, who is 
actually the one who is being punished? 
  On the other hand, the basic goals we pursued in our talks 
were related to the more active and broad participation of our 
country and companies in the humanitarian relief, resolving the 
transportation corridor issue, and preparing the ground for 
active economic relations after the embargo. Which of those 
goals do you think could jeopardize Bulgaria's national 
interests? 
  According to Borislav Jovic, chairman of the parliamentary 
Foreign Policy Commission of the Council of the Republics, the 
peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the lifting of the sanctions 
represent the backbone of Yugoslav foreign policy. However, he 
does not think that the war was the reason for imposing the 
sanctions. 
  [Chichkova] What was the real reason? 
  [Ananieva] The reason is, on the one hand, in the neo- 
imperialist interests of the United States in the Balkans within 
the framework of the international competition for influence, 
and, on the other hand, in the difficulties the United States 
encounters in implementing those goals when governments with 
leftist orientations are involved. The United States utilizes 
the sanctions in order to change the government and the people 
who rule Serbia. However, according to Mr. Jovic, this script 
is failing and only strengthens the anti-American moods. During 
our talk he expressed the opinion that no parties or persons 
should impose themselves in the Balkans. The people in this 
region have enough historical experience to select, alone, the 
parties and people whom they will entrust with their future. If 
they select the leftist alternative, as was the case with Serbia 
in the three elections since 1989, no one has the right to 
punish them with sanctions. 
  [Chichkova] However, the Socialists' influence decreased 
after the last elections. 
  [Ananieva] It rather stabilized. While only a few more 
votes were needed for gaining the absolute majority in the 
parliament, the party nevertheless seeks dialogue with other 
parliamentary factions. Mr. Dragan Tomic, the former leader of 
the Socialists' parliamentary faction, was elected chairman of 
the parliament. He even received four votes from the opposition 
in the secret vote. 
  According to the Serbian Socialist Party, the most suitable 
formula for the cabinet is a government of national unity, in 
which the Socialists will be 50 percent plus one, and will hold 
the posts of prime minister and minister of the interior. They 
do not think that this is shifting responsibility, but rather a 
proposal to share the responsibility and participate in the 
government. In the next six months, they anticipate an economic 
stabilization and production revival. However, Mr. Milorad 
Vucelic, the newly elected leader of the Serbian Socialist Party 
parliamentary faction and general director of the Belgrade 
Television, expressed doubt whether the opposition would like to 
share the responsibility, or prefer to boycott and aggravate the 
parliamentary activity. Simultaneously, he expressed the 
Socialists' firm determination to not allow the theft of their 
election victory, because they made maximum efforts to ensure 
the country's leadership at this crisis period not only through 
specific economic and social programs, but also through their 
cadre potential. 
  [Chichkova] Do they anticipate lifting the embargo? 
  [Ananieva] According to Mr. Jovic, the world public opinion 
underwent an evolution and understood that the Serbs have been 
punished without being guilty. He thinks that, after the United 
States failed to achieve its goals, it is now seeking a solution 
and declaring a willingness to lift the embargo, without 
carrying the responsibility for this. Deputy Prime Minister 
Zeljko Simic stressed that the sanctions affect the peaceful 
population and the economy of all Balkan countries. He 
maintains that a double standard is applied regarding Serbia. 
The world public is being served biased information about the 
Yugoslav crisis, and humanitarian relief that is not subject to 
sanctions -- food, medicines, and fuel for the heating of 
hospitals and refugee camps -- is being stopped. Even 
international organizations that by definition are of a 
humanitarian character have a biased attitude and thus take part 
in the genocide of the Serbian people, Mr. Simic said. 
  Mr. Simic asked us to greet Mr. Zhelev and tell him that his 
accidental or misinterpreted statement about air strikes against 
Belgrade did not contribute to improving relations between our 
countries. He also said that, regardless of how different our 
views about the development of the new world order would be, we 
both have no chance of finding ourselves in a different 
geographic location. This means that we will also be neighbors 
in the future. The better neighbors we are, the better it is 
for us. 
  [Chichkova] What leftist Balkan forum did you discuss during 
the visit? 
  [Ananieva] Such a forum has been discussed for a long time. 
The main initiator is the Panhellenic Socialist Movement 
[PASOK]. The Serbian Socialists attribute a great importance to 
a meeting of the Balkan leftist forces. They think that such a 
meeting would facilitate a serious analysis and assessment of 
the situation in the region, would contribute to consolidating 
the leftist alternative, and would stimulate dialogue and 
cooperation. 
  Our party has already discussed this prospect with PASOK 
and, 
in our talks with the Serbs, we referred to the opportunity of 
utilizing the possibilities of the separate parties in order to 
expand participation in such a meeting. The Serbian Socialist 
Party has good relations with the leftist forces in Romania, and 
for our part, we will try to cooperate in this direction on the 
basis of our contacts with the leftist forces in Albania and 
Turkey. 
  [Chichkova] Did you want to keep your visit secret? 
  [Ananieva] If I would not have guessed why you are asking me 
this question, I would have thought that you are naive. Modern 
technology has turned the world into a village and hardly anyone 
with good senses could view a visit to a neighboring country, 
observed by the entire world, as a conspiracy. In addition, the 
mass media reported broadly on the visit. The grave accusations 
of national treason, voiced by a Bulgarian journalist in a 
foreign radiostation, were based on a report of a Bulgarian 
correspondent of the same radiostation in Belgrade. Naturally, 
her information was biased and one-sided. When no normal 
information relations exist between our two countries, only 
reports of such a biased nature could be published by the press.

<F P=106> [Report by Jozo Curic] </F>
  [Excerpt] A preliminary draft agreement has been signed on 
creating a Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, along with a 
preliminary agreement on a confederal union between Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina; transit; human rights; the organization and 
distribution of state powers within the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
federation; defense arrangements; the creation of a constituent 
assembly and high-level committees to draw up a constitution and 
take the necessary steps and measures for the realization of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation; a monetary, customs, and economic 
union; and a defense alliance between Croatia and the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. 
  In this context, both states would retain their membership 
in 
the United Nations while the Croats and Muslims would be two 
constituent peoples equally represented in a balanced way in 
state bodies. A two-chamber parliament would not be able to 
make decisions detrimental to any people. Cantons, which vest 
some functions in a federal government, are at the heart of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. 
  The [present] administration and defense chain of command 
remains the same in Bosnia until a new constitution is 
introduced. A council of Croat cantons and Croat municipalities 
in Muslim cantons and vice versa, and the federal organs jointly 
created by the Croats and Muslims are the basis for a team of 
experts in Vienna to draw up a final agreement by 15 March that 
would be signed in the White House in Washington by Presidents 
Tudjman and Izetbegovic in President Clinton's presence. 
  Last night President Clinton spoke to Sarajevo and Zagreb 
over the phone. President Tudjman thanked him for the efforts 
that the United States had invested in the Croat-Muslim 
agreement. I am honored and I appreciate the fact that this has 
taken place, President Clinton said, adding: I appreciate your 
leadership and you in your capacity as a statesman. 
  The Croatian president said that he appreciated the U.S. 
Government's involvement and asked for guarantees regarding the 
UNPA [UN protected areas]. We continue to support Croatia's 
sovereignty and integrity, was the answer coming from the White 
House. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The documents which have just been drafted at the 
State Department contain, among other things, the following: 
The text of an outline agreement on a federation and the 
division of powers among the cantons and the central goverment 
[in Bosnia-Herzegovina]]; the text of a preliminary agreement on 
the principles and foundations of the confederation of the 
Republic of Croatia and the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation; and 
the document on a transit agreement between Croatia and the 
federation. While I am filing this report, the two delegations 
and their hosts are holding talks. 
  A document has also been drafted on the founding of 
high-level committees which, between 4 and 15 March, most 
probably in Vienna, will analyze, prepare, and formulate a draft 
constitution for Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as a preliminary 
agreement between Croatia and the federation, an agreement on 
military arrangements within the federation, and on interim 
measures and government bodies. The committee will coordinate 
the implementation of the outline agreement on the federation. 
  A document on protection of human rights has also been 
drafted, containing reference to a series of conventions and 
declarations on protection of human rights, minorities etc. 
  Foreign Minister Granic was received in Washington this 
morning by U.S. Vice President Al Gore. The talks were also 
attended by Ambassadors Redman, Sarcevic, and Galbraith. The 
Muslim-Croat agreement and possible solutions for the crisis in 
the Balkans were discussed. 
  Both sides want, in principle, to reach an agreement. The 
solution is to be found at a diplomatic level in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gore said. An outline has already been 
provided by NATO and the United Nations, whose decisions we have 
to implement, the U.S. vice president told reporters. He added 
that NATO and UN decisions have improved chances of success in 
the diplomatic field. It has been demonstrated that this yields 
success, Al Gore said. 
  We will try today to sign the preliminary agreement on a 
federation between the Croats and Muslims and on a confederation 
between the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and Croatia, Granic 
told reporters at the White House. We are now in the final 
stage of the negotiations and let us wait and see what happens, 
Granic said. 
  Al Gore spoke about U.S. aid to Croatia in the following 
spheres: Help will be provided in the peaceful reintegration of 
UN protected areas; some commentators have been talking about 
credits to the tune of $500 million. The Partnership for Peace 
has also been mentioned. International financial institutions 
will approach Croatia once the agreement is signed, which is 
expected to be done on 15 March at top level, and then endorsed 
by the Croatian Assembly. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Washington, March 2 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems and 
Croats and Croatia signed an accord late on Tuesday [1 March] on 
forming a federation of the two Bosnian nations and its 
confederation with neighbouring Croatia. After four days of 
intensive talks in Washington, held under strong U.S. diplomatic 
pressure, especially on Croatia, the accord was signed by 
Foreign Minister Mate Granic for Croatia, Premier Haris 
Silajdzic for Bosnian Moslems and Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir 
Zubak for the Croats, in the presence of U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher. 
  Some questions, notably those in the military sphere, have 
been left open and are shortly to be put on the agenda. 
  The former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina is being 
torn apart by a civil and ethnic war which broke out nearby two 
years ago among the local Moslems, Serbs and Croats. 
  The accord guarantees repatriation and restoration of 
property to all refugees and displaced persons. 
  The agreement between the Moslems and Croats envisages for a 
federation of cantons, to be formed on the principle of ethnic 
majority in individual regions. The document, the contents of 
which have not been disclosed, provides for equal rights of the 
Moslem and Croat cantons which should have their own police 
force and pursue an independent policy in education, culture, 
housing, (?public) works and radio and television. 
  The accord envisages for a central government which should 
regulate the foreign, defence and foreign trade policies. The 
president and vice-president of the federation should be elected 
by a bicameral parliament, with the posts rotated between the 
nationalities annually. 
  Apart from setting up a Moslem-Croat federation, the accord 
envisages for the new state's confederation with Croatia. It 
defines March 15 as the deadline for formulating a draft 
constitution of the new state and the modalities of its 
confederation with Croatia. 
  After the signing ceremony, Christopher said that the United 
States and the Western allies would make every effort for the 
accord to be implemented in practice and promised to assist 
Bosnian reconstruction financially. 
  Moslem Premier Silajdzic said he was "hoping and praying" 
this was the first step in the direction of peace and that the 
United States would remain actively involved in the peace 
process in the future. 
  The U.S. Administration hopes as the next stage to put 
pressure on Bosnian Serbs to join the new bilateral federation, 
although government circles are less than optimistic as to the 
chances of this. 
  Washington hopes that the concept of a dual state would make 
it possible for the Moslems to retain, at least partially, the 
integrity of Bosnia, enlarge the territory under their control, 
give them access to the sea and create a strong negotiating 
(and, possibly military) bloc against the Serbs in the next 
stage.

  [Text] Moscow, March 2 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic criticized the United States Wednesday for its 
role in brokering a Moslem-Croat federation agreement without 
consulting the Serbs, but stopped short of condemning the deal. 
  "We can welcome this agreement only if it is not aimed 
against Serbs. Only if it leads us to peace and not war," he 
said following a meeting here with Vladimir Shumeyko, the 
chairman of the upper house of Russia's parliament, the 
Federation Council. 
  He said the United States was trying to take over the role 
of 
the United Nations in the peace process by brokering the 
agreement Tuesday under which Bosnia's Moslems and Croats would 
form a federation on territory they control in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He charged that Washington was "biased in favor of the 
Moslems" and voiced concern that the United States was 
"monopolising" the process. "We would like to see America 
unbiased, impartial and then we would accept one power to 
mediate those talks. But I don't think that the United Nations 
should be abandoned and let one power arbitrate," he said. 
  Karadzic, who agreed to Russian requests Tuesday to open 
Tuzla airport in northern Bosnia to humanitarian flights as long 
as this was under Russian supervision, also said he told 
Shumeyko, whose chamber is empowered to authorise the deployment 
of Russian troops abroad, that he was ready to pull back on 
territorial gains made in the 23-month war. 
  "We are ready to give back, to roll back, a big amount of 
territory. (...) We are ready for compromises and we want 
Russia to support us in compromises provided we protect basic 
Serbian national interests," he stated. 
  Karadzic called for "Bosnia's new borders" to be "guaranteed 
by an international agreement at the highest level" and cited a 
proposal by President Boris Yeltsin to hold a five-nation summit 
as an initiative that could lead to such a treaty.

  [Text] The Hague, March 1 (AFP) -- A group of 280 Dutch UN 
peacekeeping soldiers headed to Bosnia Tuesday [1 March] to join 
a Dutch battalion in charge of protecting the Moslem enclaves of 
Srebrenica and Zepa, a Defense Ministry spokesman here said. 
  The soldiers are expected to arrive in the Croat seaside 
city 
of Split Tuesday afternoon. On Wednesday, after recovering 
equipment from a Dutch navy frigate, they are to head to 
Lukavac, where their battalion is based, and then on to 
Srebrenica and Zepa, in eastern Bosnia. 
  The Defense Ministry spokesman said the 280 soldiers will 
bring up to 1,100 the number of Dutch soldiers deployed in 
Bosnia. An additional 150 are expected there by the end of the 
month, he added. Additional Dutch soldiers are deployed in 
ex-Yugoslavia and on air bases in Italy from where they enforce 
the UN no-flight ban over Bosnia. Dutch troops are also 
deployed along the Danube to enforce a trade embargo against 
Serbia.

<F P=106> [Article by Miroslav Lazanski: "The Secret of Departing </F>
Airport"] 
  [Text] The place from which the four aircraft that were 
downed by U.S. F-16 fighters had taken off as well as the 
nationality of these downed aircraft are actually the biggest 
dilemmas of the air duel in the sky of the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The question to whom belonged the aircraft 
that NATO circles initially identified as Super-Galebs, that is 
to say, G-4's, and subsequently informed that they were actually 
Jastrebs, that is to say, J-1 aircraft, is the key element of 
the entire story. 
  According to some information from NATO, the downed aircraft 
allegedly bore old Yugoslav markings, which is peculiar bearing 
in mind that aircraft on the entire territory of the former 
Yugoslavia no longer carry such markings. One thing is 
perfectly obvious, namely, that the downed aircraft definitely 
did not take off for Bosnia from the FRY territories, and there 
are no uncertainties about this. 
  The air force of the Serbian Republic possesses 42 Orao 
aircraft and only one G-4 Super-Galeb, according to present 
information. Because UN observers who register each take-off are 
deployed at the Banja Luka airport, there is also a question of 
whether the aircraft could have taken off from this airport at 
all. True enough, G-4 can take off from grass runways, that is 
to say, from provisional war airports, but the UN observers are 
probably also supervising the localities where the aircraft of 
the Serbian Republic are stationed. 
<H5>  Clash of "a Yugo car" and a Train </H5>
  Did the two or four U.S. F-16 Fighting Falcons in the air 
meet with a group of six G-4's or six Jastrebs that were 
returning from a bombing raid on the artillery arms factory in 
Novi Travnik and a factory near Bugojno, which is in Muslim 
hands, and by firing altogether six air-to-air (Sidewinder) and 
(AMRAAM) missiles at them down four aircraft on that occasion? 
There are several versions about what happened in the sky above 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  According to NATO sources, the U.S. fighters asked the 
unknown aircraft to land but, allegedly, there was no reply and 
for this reason the F-16's fired air-to-air missiles. Four 
aircraft were hit and downed, while two aircraft in a low fight 
quickly disappeared from the scene of the clash in the direction 
of the Adriatic Sea. 
  According to some other sources, one aircraft each fell in 
the vicinity of Kljuc, Sipovo, and Petrovac, and three pilots 
allegedly died while one saved himself by ejecting. According 
to the same source, one U.S. F-16 was shot down with a missile 
from the ground, even though NATO has not confirmed this. 
  Did the G-4's or perhaps Jastrebs stand any chance at all in 
the air duel with the U.S. F-16? The reply is negative, as 
these are two entirely different categories of aircraft. The 
U.S. aircraft are faster, more mobile in the air, have better 
electronics, are better armed, and on top of all this are 
receiving help from AWACS so that the pilots in G-4's or 
Jastrebs stood absolutely no chance in such an unequal duel. 
This was actually a meeting resembling a crash between "a Yugo 
car" and a train. 
<H5>  Libyan Jastrebs </H5>
  Is there a possibility that these were aircraft of the 
Republic of Croatia? Croatia does not own G-4 aircraft nor 
Jastrebs, unless somebody has sold them to it in the meantime. 
Some Arab countries (Libya) namely possess Galeb and Jastreb 
aircraft, and the possibility of such a transfer is, therefore, 
not completely out of the question, as the arms channels are 
very twisted indeed. 
  Croatian pilots are trained on Galeb and Jastreb aircraft 
and 
the NATO information that two from the group of six aircraft 
flew toward the Adriatic coast is very indicative. NATO should 
have released information obtained from AWACS as to where these 
aircraft landed. 
  It is possible that these were aircraft from the fleet of 
the 
republic of Serbian Krajina which has several aircraft of this 
type at Udbina airport. In any case, a group of six aircraft 
simultaneously in the air suggests an action of a more important 
nature, and the assumptions about the bombing of factories in 
Novi Travnik and near Bugojno have some substance. However, the 
Croats currently have more motives for attacking these factories 
than the Bosnian Serbs do.

  [Text] Podgorica, Yugoslavia, March 1 (AFP) -- The four 
warplanes shot down Monday [28 February] by NATO fighters over 
Bosnia were piloted by Bosnian Serbs flying for the 
self-proclaimed "Serb Republic of Krajina" in Croatia, a 
Yugoslav Air Force pilot said here Tuesday [1 March]. 
  The pilot, who wished to remain anonymous, said three of the 
Serbs were killed and the fourth ejected to safety. He named 
the dead men as Lieutenants Sisarica, Zoric and Zvezdan Pesic. 
  Pesic was based at Podgorica with the Air Force of the rump 
Yugoslavia until January when he quit and went as a volunteer to 
Krajina, flying from the air base at Udbina, near Knin. 
  French military officials said in Paris Tuesday that it was 
"very probable" that four of the six Galeb ground attack 
aircraft intercepted by U.S. F-16s came from Ubdina, while the 
others took off from another Serb base at Banja Luka, northwest 
Bosnia. 
  In London and Zagreb, British and UN officials said Tuesday 
it was probable that the aircraft had taken off from 
Serb-controlled bases in Croatia. 
  On Monday, French officials said the first reports suggested 
that all six aircraft had come from Banja Luka. The two 
aircraft which escaped the attack left "due west" and landed 
probably at the base at Udbina, the officials said Tuesday. 
  "The U.S. pilots saw explosions on the ground when they 
intercepted the Serb planes," one said. "A munitions depot was 
attacked," but "nobody can say exactly what were the Serb 
pilots' intentions." 
  "The Serbian pilots could have dropped their bombs to make 
themselves more manoeuvrable and able to escape from the US 
planes, or to really bomb a site." 
  In London, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told the House of 
Commons that the aircraft probably came from Serb-controlled 
bases in Croatia. "It's not yet clear where the six Galeb 
planes came from though it seems at least probable that they 
came from airports under the control of Serbs in Croatia but 
that is not yet certain," he said. 
  In Zagreb, a spokesman for the United Nations Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) was more cautious, saying the aircraft could 
have come from a Serb-controlled area of Croatia. 
  "That couldn't be ruled out," said Michael Williams, 
spokesman for Yasushi Akashi, the special representative of the 
UN Secretary General in the former Yugoslavia. "We do not have 
a confirmation as to which side or on whose behalf these planes 
were engaged over Bosnia-Herzegovina," he added. 
  Also in Zagreb, Jean Marcotte, spokesman for UNPROFOR 
commander General Jean Cot said the six Serb planes had just 
carried out an airstrike against an ammunition factory at Novi 
Travnik and an ammunition compound in Bugojno, both in central 
Bosnia, when they were intercepted around dawn Monday. 
  The UN had no military observers in Udbina and those at 
Banja 
Luka had been "detained, confined in their quarters for the 
whole day" Monday, Marcotte said. "There has been restriction of 
movement in different ways by all the factions since we arrived 
here," he added. 
  In Belgrade, Zoran Lilic, the president of the rump 
Yugoslavia, said the planes shot down by NATO were not Yugoslav. 
He condemned "all actions likely to lead to an escalation of 
the conflict and all recourse to force on whatever side."

  [Text] There is probably no more doubt left about the 
owners of Jastreb aircraft, downed by NATO planes above Bugojno 
yesterday. Zvjezdan Pesic, 31, was one of the pilots of the 
downed planes. His family in Podgorica was informed about this 
tragic event by the information service of the Yugoslav Army. 
According to the newly established independent Montenegrin news 
agency, MONTENA, Pesic's family has been living in Podgorica 
since last summer. They came here as refugees from Mostar. 
Pilot Zvjezdan Pesic was taken to the so-called Serb Republic 
in the course of a recent forceful mobilization. His death has 
been talked about in Podgorica since last night and many presume 
that some of the downed Jastreb planes had taken off from 
Podgorica airport.

  [Text] Zvornik, March 1 (TANJUG) -- The army of the Bosnian 
Serb Republic (VRS) continues investigating all details 
presented by NATO in connection with the air incident in the 
region of Banja Luka on Monday morning, TANJUG learned on 
Tuesday from VRS sources. The VRS for the time being has no new 
elements about the incident, in which, according to NATO, four 
planes were downed. 
  VRS sources reiterated the categorical stand of the VRS 
General Staff that no VRS planes had taken off from Banja Luka 
airfield on Monday, and stressed that U.N. military observers 
had been deployed at the military base near Banja Luka, the only 
of its kind in the Serb Republic (R.S.) for quite some time. 
  The duty of the U.N. military observers is in fact to 
monitor 
the implementation of the U.N. Security Council resolution 
banning flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina, the same sources 
recalled. 
  An element which could help the effort to establish whose 
the 
four downed planes were could be the report carried by 
Muslim-held Radio Sarajevo on Monday that Croatian planes had 
fired missiles at targets in the area of Novi Travnik, central 
Bosnia, on Monday. The given time of the attack coincided with 
the time of the air incident given by NATO. 
  Although the circumstances in which the NATO action was 
launched remain unknown, as does also the identity of the planes 
which NATO says have been shot down, foreign media rushed to 
accuse the Bosnian Serbs, alleging that the planes were theirs.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Enes Musabasic] </F>
  [Text] In March last year the UN Security Council adopted 
the no-fly zone resolution on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since then 
the Serb aggressor has violated this ban several hundreds of 
times, while the NATO planes did not react. 
  Finally it happened. By shooting down four planes of the 
Serbian air force, NATO has carried out in full the task it was 
given if the resolution was violated. One should immediately 
say that the Serb aggressor again tried to test the readiness of 
the international community to react decisively to such 
challenges. In any case, this act will have long-term 
consequences, and will considerably influence the future 
developments in the military and political situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Karadzic's Serbs made a miscalculation. 
They failed to keep in mind that things can change suddenly in 
Bosnia after the NATO ultimatum. As a matter of fact, they 
interpreted their factual defeat around Sarajevo as a victory, 
but they were forced under threat of air strikes to withdraw 
their heavy weapons. They were relying on Mummy Russia and 
several hundred Russian soldiers, who came to Sarajevo as part 
of the blue helmets. 
  Such a mood of theirs was encouraged by Russia, which has 
been caught up in euphoria after their [Sarajevo] initiative and 
the pressure they exerted on Karadzic's criminals. The Russians 
have, however, now laid their cards on the table, and revealed 
to all the protagonists in the Bosnia-Herzegovina war that they 
are not neutral and that they are openly supporting the Serb 
aggressor side. So the Serbs, busy applauding the Russians, and 
still smarting from their defeat in Sarajevo, failed to notice 
the change toward a more active attitude by the United States 
regarding the war in Bosnia. Not even the ultimatum made them 
see that. However, by shooting down four of their planes, NATO 
-- carrying out the UN mandate -- has finally taught them the 
lesson, which is what President Clinton himself told reporters. 
  The hitherto indecisiveness of the international community 
only encouraged the destroyers of Bosnia. Through lies, 
deceptions, and cunning -- after all, on top of Serb mythology, 
that is what their entire project rests on -- Milosevic and 
Karadzic (blinded) Europe and the world, while simultaneously 
carrying out their dirty work. Perhaps they would have succeeded 
in it again this time, had it not been for the chetnik planes 
[words indistinct]. As it is, the shooting down of the planes 
is a clear message to them and to all the protagonists in the 
Bosnian war. The West has finally understood that only military 
might can force the Bosnian Serbs and Milosevic to search for 
political solutions through negotiations. 
  Finally, let us also say that after the sudden cooling of 
the 
relations between Washington and Moscow -- true, not only 
because of the Bosnian issue -- the shooting down of the Serb 
planes sends a clear message to Moscow as well. Talking of the 
Russians, let us add that Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev said 
yesterday in front of a crowd of reporters that all the sides in 
the Bosnian conflict possess an air force. He said that and yet 
the ground did not open up and swallow him! 
  Only some 10 days ago, Vitaliy Churkin defended himself 
before reporters in Sarajevo saying that he had never said that 
the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina started with the attack on the 
former Yugoslav People's Army, even though he had said just that 
into the microphones of Radio Belgrade. Finally, Moscow is 
supporting the shooting down of the Bosnian Serb planes, but 
with reserves, thus leaving itself room to criticize such 
attacks in the future. 
  Kozyrev announced that the Russians would double their 
efforts to stop the war in Bosnia and find a solution for peace. 
Let us hope this will not be like their efforts to date.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Vice President </F>
Ejup Ganic by Soren Ostergaard Sorensen in Sarajevo; date not 
given] 
  [Text] Sarajevo -- NATO's military pressure has created a 
turning point in the Bosnia war. The United States and Russia 
will be better at finding a peaceful solution than the EU's 
[European Union] negotiator, Lord Owen, Bosnian Muslim Vice 
President Ejup Ganic told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. 
  The Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government considers the recent 
Geneva peace conference chaired by EU mediator Lord David Owen 
and his UN counterpart, Thorvald Stoltenberg, to be concluded. 
The United States and Russian have now taken over the initiative 
to find a broad peaceful solution to the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and this is giving rise to optimism in 
Sarajevo. So said Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic in an 
interview with BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. 
  Ejup Ganic is chiefly happy that Lord Owen is no longer at 
the center of the negotiations. The Bosnian Government has 
tried several times in vain to have Lord Owen, whom they accuse 
of being responsible for the deterioration in the situation of 
the country's Muslims, removed. 
  Lord Owen's biggest mistake, Ejup Ganic said, is that from 
the start he has accepted that the Bosnian Serbs should have 
territorial gains from their military conquests. 
  It has not been possible anywhere in the world to create a 
stable peace by rewarding the aggressor. Why should Bosnia be 
an exception? said the vice president, who takes the view that 
the EU-UN negotiations in Geneva were set up for academic 
reasons. 
  "Lord Owen has made a mess of everything by not having a 
clear agenda," said Ejup Ganic, who unlike several Bosnian 
Muslim leaders does not fear that Russia's active role both 
diplomatically and through the deployment of Russian soldiers in 
the Bosnian Serb-controlled areas could freeze the current 
military frontiers. 
  "Of course there is a strange feeling around. I grew up with 
news reports that now Russia has invaded Hungary, now they have 
invaded Czechoslovakia, and now Afghanistan. Every time Russia 
has come into the picture we have been used to seeing them as an 
invading power. But now they are here under the UN umbrella and 
under General Rose's command which will try to mix them with 
soldiers from other countries. When the Russian soldiers 
arrived, there were quite a few who did not behave particularly 
well (by celebrating with the Serbs -- editorial note). But I 
am satisfied with the official Russian statements. 
  "We could have refused the Russian soldiers access for the 
same reason that the United Nations rejected offers from Turkey, 
Pakistan, and Iran, because those countries would have taken 
sides in the war. But we accept the Russian soldiers who will 
perhaps support that element in Russian diplomacy which is 
trying to wrest the initiative away from Vladimir Zhirnovskiy's 
wing in Russia," Ejup Ganic said. 
  Ejup Ganic is happy about the past week's cease-fire in 
Sarajevo, but gave me constant reminders that the capital is 
still besieged and divided militarily. 
  "The killing of civilians has been drastically reduced 
because the artillery and the tanks in the mountains were used 
primarily to kill civilians. Our fronts are only 50 meters from 
each other and therefore the Serbs' artillery has not been 
particularly effective against our infantry, but it has been 
effective against the civilian population. That is why we are 
now seeing a clear reduction in the bombardment. But the city 
is still under siege and all the other conditions are still the 
same. In the next few days we will see what further steps we 
can take to break the siege and turn Sarajevo into an open city." 
  Vice President Ganic, who earlier in the war was viewed as 
one of the most pessimistic and uncompromising figures in the 
Bosnian Muslim leadership, views the events of recent weeks in 
Sarajevo as a turning point in the war. 
  "This has had a decisive psychological effect on the Serbian 
regime. They hade become absolutely certain that concrete steps 
would not be taken against them by the international community. 
They were 100 percent sure that the jets flying over them were 
only a show. For eight days they ignored NATO's ultimatum. But 
now I believe that they know that they have to negotiate. They 
are still trying to create confusion, but they did nevertheless 
move out of the mountains," Ejup Ganic said. 
  However, the Bosnian Muslims' optimism is still guarded and 
contains a large portion of bitterness toward the international 
community. When Ganic, as NATO's jets thunder through the air 
above Sarajevo's presidential palace, began to discuss the 
background, he tried to overcome the noise with his own 
thunderous words: 
  "NATO only needed to produce a single piece of paper which 
contained an ultimatum to the besieging Serbs to withdraw their 
heavy arms from the mountains around Sarajevo. If they had 
produced this little piece of typewritten paper earlier we would 
not today have 1,000 new graves in Sarajevo. 
  "The lesson for NATO and the United Nations is that they 
must 
stop writing all these declarations which no one understands. 
Make public something that is crystal clear. Something that 
has a clearly defined beginning and end. Something that has a 
clear deadline and a description of concrete actions which will 
be set in motion at a specified time and with specified means. 
Past declarations have been watered-down nonsense," said Ejup 
Ganic, who despite all the war's murders and destruction still 
believes that there is a possibility of creating a multiethnic 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "We must begin from within and try to recreate what we had. 
In the area controlled by Karadzic's forces 50 percent of Serbs 
have also fled. No one is asking them what sort of Bosnia they 
want. They are Bosnians. They will not suddenly be able to feel 
themselves to be something else. People from all groups in the 
population are in Croatia, Serbia, or in Western Europe. They 
have now gotten to know what a refugee's existence means. One 
day they will wake up and think about the blessings they had in 
Bosnia, and they will travel home and help in the rebuilding of 
their homeland. A partition of the country is unnatural. We 
have to heal ourselves after this tragedy. First people will 
have to learn to greet each other again. A year later they will 
perhaps be able to drink coffee together and the younger 
generation will be able to play sports together. 
  "The key point for the recreation of the multiethnic Bosnia 
is that those who are guilty of war crimes are punished. When 
this happens everyone who has lost a son or a daughter will be 
able to see who the guilty ones are, who gave the orders, and 
who carried them out. Those left behind will then perhaps be 
able to feel some relief," the Bosnian vice president said.

<F P=106> [Report by Martin Schmuck] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] If Moscow and Bosnian Serb 
leader Karadzic have their way, the airport in Tuzla, an 
industrial town in eastern Bosnia, is to be opened and guarded 
by Russian blue-helmet soldiers. 
  Talking to ZDF, Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic said that 
this is unacceptable. Bosnia has more Russians than it needs. 
The country does not want any Russians, who do not cooperate in 
stopping the war. They are only supporting the Serbs and just 
serve to cover up the domestic problems between the government 
in Moscow and Russian right-wing extremist Zhirinovskiy and 
divert attention from their internal problems, Ganic stated.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 2 March carries in its 
regular 9-minute newscast the following reports on the fighting 
in the republic. 
  Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Sermic reports that "the 
bloody 
Maglaj drama continues today. Since the early morning hours the 
chetnik weapons from all sides are targeting buildings, 
residential areas, civilians. This is hell in the Maglaj 
concentration camp in which Mladic's bloodthirsty criminals are 
killing innocent civilians. In less than one hour, and up until 
the time of filing this report over 300 tank, howitzer, and 
mortar shells have landed on the town. Systematic fire from 
four tanks, two howitzers, and dozens of guns is being directed 
at the northern, new part of Maglaj that was build just before 
the war. Pragas, antiaircraft machine guns, and snipers are 
also being used against the town." Sermic wonders why the UN 
Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] has made no attempt to enter the 
town and convey to the world the truth about the unheard-of 
suffering of the civilian population. 
  From Bihac Mirza Sadikovic reports that "the Serbian 
aggressors overnight continued their bestial shelling of Bihac 
and neighboring areas. [Words indistinct], Brekovici, Srbljani 
and all the other places situated on the right bank of the Una 
River. The Bihac industrial zone and the outskirts of the Cazin 
Commune continue to be the target of howitzers, tanks, and 
mortars. They have only one objective -- to destroy everything. 
Moreover, the chetniks continue to systematically shell the 
defense positions on Grabez and the Grmusko-Srbljanksi plateau. 
A great number of defenders have been killed overnight. It is 
obvious that this a preparation for fresh attempts at infantry 
breakthroughs." 
  Reporting from the Bosna Operative Group Press Center in 
Zavidovici, correspondent Viktor Boban says that "in the past 24 
hours, the Serbian aggressor has intensified his activity on the 
Zavidovici free territory. Indiscriminate fire from hill guns 
and antiaircraft guns, supported by 82-mm and 120-mm mortars, 
resulted in over 100 shells landing on the villages in the 
Krivaja River valley, while a 122-mm howitzer shell landed on 
Zavidovici. Antiaircraft weapons from Blizna and [name 
indistinct] pounded the villages near Ruzic and Dolna. In the 
late afternoon hours [1 Mar] overflights of chetnik helicopters 
were registered. The flights continued overnight on the Mt. 
Ozren-Zavidovici route. A veritable motorcade of enemy 
motorized vehicles from Mt. Ozren toward the Maglaj and 
Zavidovici fronts went on until the morning hours. We wonder 
whether this means that the heavy weaponry from Sarajevo is 
being transported to these areas. This morning, Dubravica was 
marked by intense antiaircraft and infantry arms' fire." 
  Zvornik correspondent Nijaz Banjanovic reports that "the 
aggressor's strong artillery attack at the entire Zvornik free 
territory went on all night. Using tanks and mortars of all 
caliber, they pounded residential areas and civilian targets in 
Zaseok, Nezuk, Kobilici, and Vitinica which resulted in immense 
material damage. Ten tank shells, fired from Kitovnice, landed 
on Zaseok overnight, while the chetniks fired another 10 shells 
this morning. Luckily, there were no casualties. The chetniks 
are targeting almost all of our positions with antiaircraft 
weaponry and snipers. The defense lines are stable."

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1800 GMT on 1 March reports the 
fiercest fighting in the following regions: 
  Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Fermic reports that "the 
Serbian aggressor" began infantry attacks in the southern and 
southeastern parts of defense early this morning. As he 
reports, "the fighters of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the 
Maglaj heroes withstood the wave of attacks and have once again 
saved their town. A true cannonade of the defense positions and 
civilian targets ensued." As Fermic continues to report, "the 
afternoon brought a more peaceful spell, which the aggressor, 
judging by the reports of military scouts, has been using to 
fill its ranks and reposition its arms, preparing itself for the 
continuation of the offensive." He adds that the situation 
regarding food and medicine supplies in Maglaj is "highly 
dramatic." 
  Reporting from the 7th South Operative Group of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, Mirudin Aldobasic says that "the 
situation was particularly hellish in the area of Kamatova Kosa 
today, where the enemy has attempted tank-infantry breakthroughs 
on several occasions. Thanks to the outstanding bravery of the 
fighters of the 207th Famous Hill Brigade Jela and the 110th 
Famous Brigade of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] Usora, all 
enemy attacks were successfully resisted." "In retaliation for 
unaccomplished tasks, the chetniks did not leave the civilians, 
the civilian quarters of Tesanj, and the free territory of Doboj 
and Teslic in peace the entire day. The chetniks have been 
using this 44th day of the constant offensive at this area to 
regroup their forces along the entire defense line, which is 133 
km long. A large concentration of enemy troops and hardware has 
been spotted in the vicinity of Usce on the Doboj battlefield." 
  As Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac "the earth has been 
simply burning since 1300 [1200 GMT]." According to him, many 
parts of the town are no longer recognizable due to massive 
destruction. "The destruction of the industrial zone of Bihac is 
terrible," Sadikovic exclaims. "At the moment, it is not 
possible to establish the number of casualties; however, it has 
exceeded 200 over the last three days. There are also many dead 
civilians, and a considerable number of defenders perished in 
the savage shelling, too. The defenders in Grabez and 
Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau have been exposed to horrendous 
attacks of howitzers, tanks, and multiple rocket launchers from 
Jelaca Greda, [word indistinct], and Tihotina throughout the 
day, especially since 1300." Sadikovic draws attention to the 
"joint fervent battles fought by the members of the 5th Corps, 
the fighters of the HVO of this region, and the members of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs. Besides this, the chetnik 
helicopters performed combat actions on several occasions today, 
firing rockets at Jezero and transporting fresh troops and 
military hardware."

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 2 (AFP) -- Besieging Serb forces 
refused Wednesday to give a UN humanitarian aid convoy 
permission to travel to the northern Moslem town of Maglaj, a UN 
spokesman said. UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
spokesman Kris Janowski said the convoy was due to leave 
Wednesday but that Serbs in Pale, the Bosnian Serb headquarters, 
said there were no officials there who could authorize the 
convoy. Janowski said the delay could be at least two or three 
days. 
  The UNHCR has had repeated problems in Bosnia's 22-month-old 
in getting convoys into besieged zones. [sentence as received] 
Serb troops have intensified attacks on Maglaj over the past 
two weeks. The last convoy to Maglaj, where 16,000 people live, 
was in October, Janowski said. He has described conditions 
there as the worst in Bosnia. He said a report he received "a 
month ago said the people there look like skin and bones." 
  In addition, a 12-truck Danish aid convoy remained blocked 
trying to get into Sarajevo. The convoy, which is stuck in 
Hadzici, 15 kilometres (nine miles) outside Sarajevo, was being 
blocked by Serb women demonstrating for their husbands to be 
released from a nearby Bosnian prison. 
  The UNHCR moves from 20-30 land convoys a day in Bosnia and 
flies from 15-20 planes a day into Sarajevo airport. It feeds 
some three million people in central Bosnia. In addition, NATO 
planes carry out nightly air drops of food to areas like Maglaj 
where convoys are denied access.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 1 (AFP) -- A total of 360 UN Dutch 
troops reached the Moslem enclave of Srebrenica in eastern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to relieve 135 UN Canadian soldiers there, a 
UN spokesman said here Tuesday [1 March]. UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) Lieutenant Colonel Bill Aikman said the Dutch had 
arrived over the past 24 hours. 
  Serb cooperation in allowing a troop rotation in Srebrenica 
was one of three demands of the international community to move 
towards peace in Bosnia. 
  The other two were to withdraw heavy weapons from 
Serb-besieged Sarajevo, which has been done, and to allow the 
re-opening of Tuzla airport in the northeast, which is due to 
take place this month. 
  Serb authorities had blocked the rotation in Srebrenica, 
insisting that the troop level in Srebrenica not increase. 
  But Aikman, a Canadian, said a total of 800-1,000 Dutch 
troops, a full battalion, would deploy in Srebrenica. The Dutch 
have arrived so far with 78 vehicles, mainly armored personnel 
carriers and other troop vehicles. Aikman said the Canadians 
would be leaving in two to three days. 
  Srebrencia is one of six UN-mandated safe areas designed to 
protect besieged Moslem populations.

  [Text] At its session in Mostar today, the executive of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Croatian Democratic Union [Hrvatska 
Demokratska Zajednica -- HDZ] has been discussing the efforts 
being made to resolve the state crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
particularly in the light of the current negotiations between 
the delegations of the Croatian and Muslim people. The HDZ has 
issued a public statement including the following: 
  First, the political will of the Croat people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has been repeatedly expressed through 
legitimate and legal representatives, through the political 
charter as well as the political declaration of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina HDZ and through the declaration of the House 
of Representatives of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. 
  Second, by sacrifice and by struggling hard for its survival 
and the protection of all its rights, the Croat people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has won an inalienable right to equality with 
the other two peoples in the homeland of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Third, the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina is willing to 
accept only such a form of Bosnia-Herzegovina's state 
organization that will secure the sovereignty of the Croat 
people in its territorial unit. This original sovereignty is 
the foundation of all forms of power, including those powers 
that are vested in bodies of the central authorities of the 
future Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Fourth, the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina takes into 
account the authentic features of individual areas in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and to this effect it is willing to work on 
seeking more suitable solutions in keeping with these features 
-- but only on the basis of the original sovereignty of the 
Croat people and reciprocal protection for the rights of members 
of all three state-building peoples. 
  Fifth, any solution to the state crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina 
which were to disregard the sovereignty of the Croat people in 
one part of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina would be at odds 
with the hitherto expressed political will, historic rights and 
interests of the Croat people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is 
all the more so as the historical experiences of sovereignty 
without a territorial definition were the main factor in the 
oppression of the Croat people and a cause of its emigration and 
demise. Sovereignty without territory has been scrapped in 
multinational communities in modern state policies and legal 
concepts and civilized countries. 
  Sixth, in seeking a just and lasting peace the Croat people 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina has always taken into account, and always 
will, the entirety of Croatian national interests.

license to PolSat. Before leaving for India this morning, Lech 
Walesa said that one of the reasons behind the dismissal of 
Marek Markiewicz from the post of chairman of the National Radio

the license for PolSat. The president said that he would 
appoint a new chairman of the Council after his return from

<F P=106> [Speech by Jerzy Milewski, secretary of state of national </F>
defense, at the Polish-Russian conference "Toward a New 
Partnership" in Krakow on 23 February] 
  [Text] The basis of Polish domestic and external security 
policy has been laid down in the "Principles of Polish Security 
Policy" signed by President Lech Walesa on 2 November 1992. The 
document entitled "The Security Policy and Defense Strategy of 
the Republic of Poland," adopted by the National Defense 
Committee on the same day, explains and expounds upon the 
principles adopted by the Polish president. The "Principles" 
clearly state that Poland sees no danger to it from any existing 
country. We are of the opinion that economic cooperation and 
joint activity in the security sphere, as well as in some 
military spheres, with our neighbors and other countries in the 
region helps eliminate potential dangers. 
  Given that NATO remains the basic factor of political 
stability and peace in Europe, Poland highly appreciates the 
Euroatlantic nature of this alliance and supports the presence 
of American forces in Europe. Poland's strategic objective in 
the 1990's is membership of NATO and of the WEU as NATO's 
European arm and a major component of the European system of 
collective security. 
  In accordance with the "Principles of Polish Security 
Policy," the Polish Armed Forces are deployed more or less 
uniformly all over Poland, thanks, among other things, to the 
formation of the Krakow Military District, which embraces the 
southern and eastern part of the country. The numerical status 
and equipment of our Armed Forces are regulated in the 
international commitments that Poland has signed. The army is 
governed by a civilian Ministry of National Defense, which is 
answerable to parliament, whereas supreme command over the Armed 
Forces is exercised by the president, who is also a civilian. 
  As was very much expected, the NATO summit in Brussels in 
January confirmed the desire to preserve NATO, and reached 
essential decisions concerning an adaptation of NATO structures 
and tasks to modern requirements. Until now, NATO doctrine has 
been based on the assumption that a mass attack by Warsaw Pact 
forces might occur one day. Today, the Warsaw Pact no longer 
exists, and the danger of a world war has shrunk to a minimum. 
However, the international experience of recent years reveals 
to us that local wars and conflicts are occurring with 
increasing frequency. Even more dangerous are paramilitary 
terrorist organizations. These are the real dangers of the 
1990's. NATO has expressed the will to meet the new challenges 
by preventing the formation of conflicts and undertaking 
energetic action to extinguish existing conflicts and combating 
the aforementioned terrorist organizations. 
  Such a development of NATO coincides with our strategic 
objective. Poland wants to see the emergence of a single 
Euroatlantic security system by means of an eastward expansion 
of NATO and the gradual incorporation of all European countries 
therein. It is essential to establish such a system in order to 
guarantee political stability on our continent. We do not view 
today's NATO and the future security system based on it as a 
passive alliance meant to protect us from another lost war if 
Poland were ever to be attacked again. 
  We imagine NATO as an organization guaranteeing all over 
Europe the status quo, the inviolability of borders, respect for 
human rights, and the preservation of modern UN and CSCE 
standards in the spheres of civic and economic freedoms, in 
keeping with European culture. We want to be an equal-ranking 
member of this organization, and make an appropriate political, 
military, and economic contribution to its joint defense 
potential. We are prepared to take part in joint political and 
military actions undertaken by NATO in order to fulfill its 
objectives. 
  We have no intention of undermining the correctness of the 
Sejm remarks of Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski whereby in 
the medium and long term, there is no danger to Poland's 
territorial integrity and "no state, no significant political 
force, and no significant politician is staking any claims 
against us." But there is a fear, justified by our historical 
experience, that negative phenomena will develop faster than 
positive ones, and that a Euroatlantic system of security, with 
Poland a participant therein, will never materialize because 
someone will effectively prevent it from doing so. 
  No doubt the biggest visible danger is Russia's return to 
the 
imperial policy first pursued by the Czars and then by the 
Soviet Union. The idea of so-called nearest foreign territory 
that we hear from the lips of leading Russian politicians, 
references to alleged "historic Russian spheres of influence" 
which include Poland; the loud objections to the possibility of 
Poland joining NATO, and remarks about an alleged duty to 
protect all Russian-speaking peoples in the countries of the 
former Soviet Union--all this we consider an expression of 
imperial policy, contrary to the standards of CSCE and hostile 
to Poland. Right now the greatest danger is that Russia might 
interpret an absence of reaction to such rhetoric as silent 
approval thereof, or even as an encouragement to proceed from 
words to deeds. Therefore someone has to say loudly that these 
are wrong things to say and do, so as to prevent the emergence 
of some irreversible situation. For every case of expansionism 
possesses its own dynamics. If it does not meet any resistance, 
it simply keeps on expanding. 
  Therefore we believe that keeping Poland and the other 
Visegrad countries, as well as the Baltic countries and Ukraine, 
within the gray zone of uncertain security, in isolation and 
without any political screen, encourages the development of 
imperial trends in Russia. The young Russian democracy may and 
should be helped by preventing the rebirth of imperial expansion 
policy; a policy, I hasten to add, that also collides with the 
interests of the Russians themselves and those of the other 
peoples that form the Russian Federation. 
  Is Poland's membership of NATO a threat to Russia? Many 
Russian politicians are fond of saying that it is. Here are a 
few examples of the arguments used to justify such an belief. 
  1. In the opinion of Andranik Migranian, adviser to 
President Yeltsin, NATO's expansion to the border of the former 
Soviet Union is to be viewed not as a desire to guarantee the 
security, sovereignty, and integrity of the borders of Poland, 
Hungary, Czech Republic, or Slovakia, but as an attempt to 
isolate Russia even further. One hears the thesis about 
isolation or about the creation of a feeling of isolation quite 
frequently from the lips of Russian politicians. 
  The first question raised by this argument is: Is it at all 
possible to isolate a country that is as big as a continent? Is 
this not merely a counterargument being employed by a power that 
is actually intent on keeping the abovementioned countries 
isolated from the West European security system? And the second 
question: Can one employ such an ambiguous and irrational 
argument as a feeling of danger? Is this not merely a 
development of the principle that the only right thing is what 
we ourselves want? 
  2. Mr. Yuriy Kashlev, Russian ambassador to Poland, says: 
"The efforts of some of our neighbors to join NATO already 
today and a shift of the NATO borders are grist to the mill of 
all the opponents of the reforms, conservative forces, and 
nationalists who are trying to block our reforms and our efforts 
to combat the crisis." 
  Vyacheslav Kostikov, Russian presidential spokesman, says: 
"If the countries of Central and Eastern Europe join NATO, the 
reforms will collapse and the army will be angry. I think that 
in such a case, the army will exert strong pressure on the 
government and president to increase military spending and alter 
the present peaceful defense doctrine of Russia." 
  These are very odd things to come from the lips of 
representatives of a country that considers itself democratic. 
It is very odd for such a country to threaten other countries 
with the dissatisfaction of its own army or that of some of its 
political groups. We, however, insist that a chance for a real 
democratization of Russia will occur only when the policy of 
Russian imperial expansion becomes unrealistic. As long as the 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe are isolated and 
constitute a potential target of Russian expansion, it is hard 
to expect Russian leaders of whatever political orientation to 
give up such a policy voluntarily. To justify this thesis one 
can cite the examples of postwar Japan and Germany, which became 
economic powers with an unquestionably democratic system because 
they were deprived of the possibility of pursuing an 
expansionist imperial policy. 
  3. Again Yuriy Kashlev, Russian ambassador to Poland: "NATO 
arose at a time when the Warsaw Pact existed, and at that time 
its objective was clear. Today the Warsaw Pact no longer 
exists, but the arrows on NATO war charts are still pointing in 
the same direction. NATO has failed to undergo an adequate 
transformation, its member countries are still looking about 
them and waiting. As a military alliance, NATO has to have an 
enemy and be directed against someone." But, I ask you, against 
whom? 
  An acceptance of the principle that every military alliance 
must be directed against someone creates another question: 
Against whom is the CIS defense alliance directed? How are the 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe, especially the Baltics 
and Ukraine, to view this system? Perhaps the principle alone 
is faulty, perhaps it is still enshrined in the cold war reality? 
  "Partnership for Peace" [PFP] is the path to NATO. Poland's 
decision to accept the NATO-proposed PFP was dictated by the 
conviction that it is possible to form a military alliance "for" 
something, and not just "against" someone or something. Poland 
has already signed an initial agreement, and is preparing 
specific plans of military cooperation with NATO countries and 
other PFP participants. We view PFP as our road to full NATO 
membership. As I said in the beginning, this is Poland's 
strategic choice. We consider PFP a good preparatory program 
that makes our gradual integration with NATO very much easier. 
  The reservations expressed by the Polish authorities did not 
concern PFP itself, but the fact that the latest NATO summit 
failed to provide us with a political screen in the form of NATO 
associate membership or participation in the NATO political 
structures, a political screen that we need today in view of the 
growing political threat from the East. We will continue to ask 
for this political screen, not relinquishing for a single 
instant our active participation in PFP. 
  To sum up, it must be emphasized that: 
  1. We consider NATO membership not just a chance to include 
Poland in the "good" part of Europe, as Ambassador Kashev puts 
it. We consider NATO membership as a brick in the building of a 
Euroatlantic security system in which every country interested 
in this security and willing to fulfill basic conditions should 
take part. 
  2. We do not think Poland's membership of NATO involves any 
threat to any of our neighbors. On the contrary, we believe it 
would provide them with extra security. 
  3. I hope that Poland's unequivocal and clear stance 
concerning our country's security and that of this region and of 
the whole of Europe will be understood by our partners and 
neighbors. Clara pacta faciunt amicos [Clear agreements make 
friends].

<F P=106> [Interview with Lech Falandysz, deputy chief of the </F>
Presidential Chancellery, by Janusz B. Grochowski; place and 
date not given: "I Believe That There Will Be an Agreement"] 
  [Text] [Grochowski] Is the latest dispute between the 
president and parliament merely about the Constitution? 
  [Falandysz] It is difficult to say for sure, because every 
political dispute has consequences that go beyond its initial 
subject. But this dispute concerns the method of drafting the 
Constitution. I think the president is right to say that one 
should give it exceptional legislative treatment. 
  [Grochowski] The slogan "Take matters into your own hands" 
is very controversial. It could be interpreted as an attempt to 
deprive parliament of the legitimacy that was accorded to it by 
fully free and democratic elections. 
  [Falandysz] Nobody has ever questioned this legitimacy. It 
was not the president who began to amend the law on preparing 
and adopting a new Constitution to make it necessary for the 
Constitution to be approved by the population in a general 
referendum. What happened was that certain people suddenly 
began to think about an initial constitutional referendum. We 
think that this is a bad idea. Needless to say, the president 
did not object to this idea, but he did suggest a different 
solution whereby any organized group of citizens may submit its 
own draft Constitution to the National Assembly Constitutional 
Commission. 
  The idea of dissolving parliament should parliament's own 
draft Constitution be rejected in a referendum has nothing to do 
with undermining parliament's legitimacy, either. Parliament 
itself has decided on direct democracy, and all we wanted to do 
was expand this democracy. However, it turns out that the 
deputies cannot even be bothered to consider the president's's 
draft Constitution. 
  [Grochowski] Various explanations are being given for the 
present situation. The most frequent explanation is that the 
president has already started his election campaign. 
  [Falandysz] This conflict would never have come about if the 
Sejm had displayed at least a tiny bit of courtesy and conveyed 
the draft Constitutions to the Commission. How can one suspect 
the president of starting his election campaign if it is not his 
fault that the dispute started in the first place? 
  [Grochowski] There is talk of another "war at the top" 
designed to break up the present government coalition. 
  [Falandysz] In politics, one ought to avoid mistakes, and 
once a mistake has been made, one ought to admit it. The Sejm 
cannot reject an initiative from the head of state without any 
more ado. It can criticize such an initiative, as it has already 
done, but it should also accord it proper treatment and let 
standing committees hold discussions on it. Yet in the 
meantime, the doors of parliament have been slammed in the 
president's face. 
  But there is no war at the top. After all, President Walesa 
is not under parliament's authority. 
  [Grochowski] Then why is the Belvedere mainly attacking the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], even though a part of the Polish 
Peasant Party and Union of Labor also voted against the 
president's draft Constitution? 
  [Falandysz] Prominent SLD politicians have also defended 
parliament's decision to throw out Walesa's draft Constitution. 
The Peasant Party kept silent. All this can be taken to mean 
that the SLD is at war with the president. 
  [Grochowski] The president has the right to withdraw any 
legislative initiative of his, including his draft Constitution. 
Anyone who submits a legislative initiative has a similar right. 
But I am not sure if the president's representative can cease 
taking part in the work of the Constitutional Commission. 
  [Falandysz] One can apply various interpretations, including 
one whereby without a presidential representative, the 
Constitutional Commission cannot perform its work. One might 
also say that the president has a duty to send a representative 
to this Commission. But nowhere is it written who this 
representative should be, and the law certainly does not say it 
has to be me. However, former prime ministers Suchocka and 
Mazowiecki are correct in saying that the Constitution can only 
be formed with the president's participation, and everything 
must be done to make him participate. 
  [Grochowski] Do you see any solution to this problem? 
  [Falandysz] Yes. I think one should seek a compromise. One 
such compromise is the inclusion of a group of people from 
outside parliament in the work of the Constitutional Commission. 
One could go even further. The Sejm could restrict itself to 
current affairs and let the new Constitution be prepared by a 
separate constitutional body consisting of representatives of 
all parties. Each party would be represented therein in a 
proportion that corresponds to the votes that it received in the 
parliamentary elections. 
  There are various possible solutions, and one has to pick 
the 
best one. After all, the Constitution is supposed to be 
apolitical, and must be addressed to the whole population, 
including those who lost the elections. And yet the 
parliamentary majority is inclined to adhere stubbornly to its 
convictions, an attitude that could isolate the authors of the 
new Constitution. In such a case, a referendum would turn even 
a perfectly worded Constitution into a political text that 
serves the interests of the present parliamentary majority. 
  [Grochowski] Is anyone in Poland seriously concerned about 
the new Constitution? All the proposals that have been 
presented are merely delaying work on it. 
  [Falandysz] Unlike the SLD and Union of Labor, the president 
has never insisted that work on the new Constitution be speeded 
up so that it can be adopted as quickly as possible. We cannot 
have a sloppy Constitution. Those postcommunist countries that 
rushed to produce e new Constitution are now regretting their 
haste. 
  In the army, various scenarios have to be tried out on 
exercise grounds before they are put into practice. In 
politics, such a training ground is the Small Constitution. 
However, instead of trying ideas out, our politicians are 
attempting to impose on the population whatever they think fit. 
And yet the Constitution cannot be merely the outcome of 
decisions by politicians. It must be the end result of a 
political process. 
  [Grochowski] You mean, it must be the culmination of a 
certain stage of political change? 
  [Falandysz] Yes, otherwise it is very difficult to define 
Poland's future. 
  [Grochowski] We know there is an urgent need to define 
powers concerning Poland's defense. The president wants to form 
a National Security Council. Will the present conflict not 
block this idea? 
  [Falandysz] Presidential ideas about national defense have 
always been in danger of being rejected by a parliamentary 
majority. One can understand parliament's reluctance to increase 
the president's powers, but as the president is constitutionally 
responsible for Polish security, his powers in this sphere have 
to be wider. This topic will be very difficult to discuss, but 
I still think that an agreement on it will be reached. I think 
the views of the military community should determine the outcome 
of this debate, because for understandable reasons, the army is 
subject to different rules. 
  [Grochowski] The president has said he sees no possibility 
of cooperating with a parliament that is dominated by the left 
wing. Does this inability to cooperate with parliament only 
concern constitutional issues? 
  [Falandysz] The president has made it clear that he sees no 
possibility of discussing his constitutional initiative with 
parliament. But he has also said that he will cooperate with 
the Sejm speaker on every other issue. That should dissolve all 
the speculation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Leszek Miller, Polish labor and social </F>
policy minister, by Andrzej Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet 
studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet" program--live] 
  [Text] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is Labor 
Minister Leszek Miller. Good morning to you. 
  [Miller] Good morning to you, and to you, Ladies and 
Gentlemen. 
  [Woyciechowski] Are you afraid of strikes? 
  [Miller, hesitating] Naturally, a strike is not a pleasant 
thing to happen, and my assessment is that there are certainly 
reasons to have these protests and this turmoil. I reject the 
notion of a double-face morality which is about the fact that in 
the previous term Sejm, when we were in the opposition, we 
thought for instance that the protests by the All-Polish Trade 
Unions Agreement [OPZZ] were justified, whereas today, under the 
type of moral standards I mentioned, I would have to say that 
the protests by Solidarity are unjustified. The fact is though 
that these protests are indeed justified since the situation of 
many thousands of Polish families is difficult without a doubt, 
and in many cases it is even outright tragic. And when I hear, 
or read on lists of demands, that [hesitating] unemployment must 
be reduced, then of course I agree with that proposition, except 
I would like to remind you that it is not Waldemar Pawlak's 
cabinet that caused this unemployment of 3 million people. And 
when I read for instance that retirement pensions and other 
kinds of pensions must be raised, then I agree with that, as 
well, except that it is not Waldemar Pawlak's cabinet that 
reduced the so-called fundamental amount from 100 percent to 91 
percent. I could go on and on like this, citing similar 
examples. So, it would be hard to expect that after three 
months of the government's term, these painful problems will be 
immediately resolved as if by some magical trick. So while 
agreeing that there are indeed reasons for the protests, I 
disagree with the way there problems are being resolved--that is 
to say, we are proposing negotiations, peaceful talks regarding 
specific measures, and we are proposing to leave protests and 
strikes as a last resort, not as the first one. 
  [Woyciechowski] What is the story with the negotiations? 
Solidarity keeps accusing you, saying that it wants to negotiate 
while the government refuses to do so. Recently, the miners' 
Solidarity said that if the government does not begin 
negotiations by 7 March, then the miners will go on strike. So 
who wants to negotiate and who does not? 
  [Miller] You know, at the same time as these statements are 
[hesitating] being conveyed to the public, six working groups 
including 17 trade union centers, two employer organizations, 
and also representatives of territorial self-governments, are 
negotiating with each other on the topic of citizens' social 
rights, I mean citizens' social guarantees. On some of these 
issues, agreement has already been reached--for instance, 
regarding the directions of amendments to [hesitating] the 
family-benefits system. Yesterday, a very interesting idea 
emerged, to initiate work on a law on family benefits--the idea 
is to accumulate all benefits for children and families in just 
one legal document. Of course this will have to be done by 
modernizing the law. In my view, that is the way to solve the 
many problems of Polish families. 
  With regard to the accusation of not negotiating, [Industry 
and Trade] Minister Pol conducts many different kinds of 
negotiations every single day. I think that.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But who should be involved in 
the negotiations: the industry minister, or the labor minister? 
  [Miller] Exactly. I think that the industry minister should 
definitely negotiate these issues. But you know, I think the 
essence of the misunderstanding is that many trade union 
activists seem to think that ministers continue to be the right 
partners for negotiations, and not the president of a company or 
the manager of an enterprise. Well, this is no longer 1989, and 
even less is it 1980. Deep changes have occurred in the Polish 
economy since then. Fortunately, these changes were geared 
toward decentralization. That is why ever fewer decisions are up 
to Minister Pol for instance, and more and more decisions are up 
to the president of a company, the manager of an enterprise, or 
to managers or chairmen of economic units. 
  [Woyciechowski] Does it mean Minister Pol is not empowered 
to decide on salary hikes for miners, but the decision has to be 
made by the mine's manager? 
  [Miller] That is the way it is, more or less. 
  [Woyciechowski] And are you empowered to make a decision 
on a raise for anybody, I mean you, the labor minister? 
  [Miller] I am not, because what I deal with professionally 
is [hesitating] lessening the pain of the systemwide and 
economic transformations, but my main concern is assistance to 
the very poorest and protection to those who are suffering the 
most. But my feeling is that within these requests for talks 
and negotiations, or within the demands being made, there is a 
kind of, you know, a nostalgic tone .... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Do you mean it is a nostalgia 
for communism? 
  [Miller] Not so much for communism as for measures that are 
characteristic of a centralized economic system, where there is 
just one manager--this could be for instance the industry 
minister--who is in charge of thousands of different kinds of 
companies and who makes the most important decisions, along with 
the chief of the Planning Commission. But in reality, we have 
thousands of managers in Poland right now who have to make their 
decisions based on the state of their individual units. 
  [Woyciechowski] What you just said was a tribute to 
capitalism. 
  [Miller, hesitating] I am not sure whether it is capitalism. 
It was rather a tribute to a certain way of managing the 
economy. You know, my view is that .... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Tell me, three months passed 
since you took up the post of labor minister, and, during the 
three months, you never met face-to-face with [Solidarity 
Chairman] Krzaklewski. Was it him or you that did not want to 
meet? 
  [Miller] I did meet with him. We even had a live television 
debate recently; we debated for half an hour. We meet with many 
representatives of Solidarity. Yesterday, for instance--I think 
this is worth putting on record--a very important event took 
place, namely the prime minister awarded [hesitating] the 
official appointments to new members of a trilateral commission 
for social and economic affairs. As the name itself indicates, 
this trilateral commission consists of employers, trade unions, 
and government representatives. Within the trade union 
group--let us say it this way--there are four Solidarity 
representatives who received appointments yesterday. You know, 
the reason I am stressing this fact is because for the first 
time in these transformation achievements of ours, a trilateral 
commission was established officially and on the basis of a 
resolution by the government. By the way, I must also praise 
here the negotiators involved in the Agreement on State-Owned 
Enterprises, since the commission was set up kind of as a result 
of the Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises--and that trilateral 
commission consists of representatives of employers, trade 
unions, and the government. The commission has quite 
considerable powers regarding issuing opinions and it will 
gather at a single table representatives of different trade 
unions and also representatives whose social and economic 
interests vary so much. So that commission will be an area for 
coming to an agreement regarding very significant 
decisions--against the background of what is happening in Poland 
today, that fact is important to the extent that it is proof of 
the direction of seeking social peace. 
  [Woyciechowski] But let us return for a moment to the 
strikes: Is it your impression today--now that Solidarity 
initiated a wide-scale strike operation, today the miners in 
Rybnik will be on strike for two hours--is it your impression 
that these strikes are politically motivated, that is to say 
that they are being conducted against the cabinet? 
  [Miller, hesitating] You know, I try not to deal with such 
easy-sounding suspicions or descriptions. I always try to 
answer the question of whether there are economic, social, and 
standard-of-living related reasons. So in this case, my answer 
is: Yes, there are reasons. So to a large extent, these 
protests and strikes are a result of these social reasons. But 
judging from the nature of some demands being made, one can kind 
of conclude that these strikes are political in nature. 
  [Woyciechowski] But if there are economic reasons, then why 
is it that Solidarity is on strike but OPZZ is not? 
  [Miller] Because that is exactly the issue of the choice of 
[hesitating] the way to resolve these economic hardships: 
Either at a negotiating table where we would draft new laws or 
improve the existing ones, or else by protests and by using 
primarily emotions. And since you asked me about this, I will 
tell you honestly--I think these protests and strikes are 
undoubtedly a response to the existing reality, but they do not 
change that reality. 
  [Woyciechowski] Are they a reaction to the reality or to 
the leftist government? 
  [Miller] Well, a reaction to the reality understood mainly 
as the material situation of large social groups; also, 
partially, a reaction to the leftist government. However, I 
think that the reality changes at negotiation tables. In a 
centralized economy, in an economy that you have called 
communist, there was one partner on one side, and another 
partner on the other. Now there are many partners. There are 
many interests as well. Therefore, the only reasonable thing to 
do in such situations are negotiations during which the 
participants want to find more or less common points of view. 
  [Woyciechowski] Recently, a few days ago, President Walesa 
declared that he would soon start the process of file-checking 
and decommunization. Do you fear that the president will 
decommunize you? 
  [Miller, laughs] Well, our president says various things. 
Sometimes they border on a kind of a black humor. Poles have 
managed to get used to this; some get irritated, look at their 
wristwatches, and look forward to the end of this term of 
office; others are delighted. I would personally compare the 
president's recent statements to some kind of a black humor. 
You know, it is difficult to say that I am delighted with Mr. 
Kaczynski, for instance. He is not one of my favorite 
politicians. However, when Mr. Kaczynski says that if the 
president wants to start decommunization and file-checking, he 
should begin with his own office, then I must say that I really 
liked this statement by Mr. Kaczynski. 
  [Woyciechowski] Did you get the impression that the 
president declared war on the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]? 
Can this be defined in such terms? 
  [Miller] We could hear such overtones. He will not come to 
the parliament, he rejects the possibility of cooperation, and 
so on and so forth. However, the president often changes his 
mind and we should wait; perhaps in a week or two, when the 
emotions are not so high, the president will say something 
reconciliatory. Well, many words were spoken unnecessarily. 
Incidentally, I think that nothing much would have happened if 
the Sejm had forwarded the constitution bill.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What did you vote for? 
  [Miller] Unfortunately, I was not there when the ballot was 
held.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What if you had been there? 
  [Miller] I would have voted for forwarding the bill to the 
committees. You know, I remember something that happened in the 
previous Sejm. The SLD Deputies' Club tried to place on the 
Sejm agenda an initiative that was very important from our point 
of view; it was the passing of the Socioeconomic Charter. It 
was supposed to be kind of a supplement to the Constitution, a 
supplement concerning social issues, related to the living 
standard. At that time our initiative was rejected in the first 
reading. It was obviously rejected for political reasons. We 
felt really bad about; we felt like people who were.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] I remember that moment. 
However, now this Sejm actually did a very similar thing. 
  [Miller] And they were slapped hard in the face. Now, 
unfortunately, the situation was similar. Therefore, I try not 
to forget the bad feeling we felt to prevent other people from 
feeling the same way. Thus, I do not think that something bad 
would have happened if this draft constitution had been 
forwarded to Sejm committees. However, we must make up our 
minds to it; what is done cannot be undone. Now we should not 
escalate this conflict. 
  [Woyciechowski] Today's press has published the results of 
an opinion poll conducted by the Public Opinion Research Center. 
Poles were asked who is their best candidate for the post of 
the president. You must have seen these results. Kwasniewski 
comes first, with 17 percent; far behind him is Pawlak, with 11 
percent; Lech Walesa has 9 percent. Is Kwasniewski the best 
candidate of SLD for the post of the president? 
  [Miller] He definitely is the best candidate and I am really 
glad that Olek [diminutive of Aleksander] occupies such a 
position. You know, I have known Mr. Kwasniewski for many 
years. I must admit that I do not know a better expert in 
resolving conflict situations; I do not know anyone who has 
greater abilities as far as reconciliating various views is 
concerned. Now, if we add his brilliance and intelligence to 
that, then it becomes clear that he is our best candidate for 
that post. 
  [Woyciechowski] Of course, what I wanted to ask you about... 
[Woyciechowski pauses] You understood the allusion. What about 
the rumors that within SLD there are other candidates for the 
post of the president as well? Is there a conflict there? The 
name of Cimoszewicz is often mentioned. Is it merely a gossip 
or not? 
  [Miller] You know, SLD is very rich in outstanding persons. 
There is no doubt about that. However, among those outstanding 
figures, the star of Kwasniewski is shining the brightest. 
  [Woyciechowski] Do you already know the name of the future 
deputy prime minister and finance minister? 
  [Miller] No, unfortunately I do not. 
  [Woyciechowski] What about the names of the candidates? 
  [Miller] I know several candidates, at least. I have heard 
various names. However, due to the fact that Mr. Kwasniewski 
asked us not to discuss these matters in greater detail... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In other words, you know, but 
you will not tell us... 
  [Miller, interrupting] Let us not discuss this in detail, 
then. 
  [Woyciechowski] Yesterday you won the lawsuit with ZYCIE 
WARSZAWY. It was a precedent. For the first time a politician 
managed to win a classical, as it were, lawsuit for libel. 
Could you say a few words about that? 
  [Miller] Yes, I am very pleased with that, because this was 
a long story; it lasted two years, beginning in December 1991. 
At that time and even later on, ZYCIE WARSZAWY published 
made-up stories about my participation in the so-called Moscow 
loan, that is, the loan of the Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union for the Polish United Workers' Party. I decided that all 
acceptable norms had been violated in those lies and slanders. 
I instituted legal proceedings. Only after two years, 
yesterday the case was brought to the end. ZYCIE WARSZWY is 
obliged to apologize to me and pay 25 million zlotys [Z] to the 
bank account of the Polish Red Cross in Lodz. In Lodz because I 
come from Lodz. I am also very happy.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Does it, then, pay to sue 
newspapers? 
  [Miller] It does pay for those who have a lot of patience. 
Now, when I recall that two years have passed, that over those 
two years ZYCIE WARSZAWY... [Miller pauses] You know, this is 
interesting. I have often made statements on these issues; I 
have organized many press conferences; I have written all kinds 
of corrections. I thought that the editors, knowing that they 
are being sued, would be more moderate However, what happened 
was just to the contrary. Over those two years the intensity of 
those slanders did not wane at all. Therefore, I believe that 
it is good to do this in drastic cases; however, one must 
realize right at the beginning that this is going take a lot of 
time and that the compensation, especially in the financial 
sense, will be very insignificant, and that it may happen that 
the people will eventually forget what it was all really 
about.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And just like today, only one 
newspaper published a report on that court verdict--a short 
report consisting of six lines, whereas at that time newspapers 
carried big headlines. 
  [Miller] This is typical. When this case began, all.... 
[Miller pauses] Most of the press as well as radio and 
television newscasts, began with this information: Miller did 
this or did that. Now that this case has finally been finished, 
there is only silence. Thus, this is a reflection for me, and 
maybe not only for me but also for the listeners, perhaps, about 
the objectivity and impartiality of the mass media. 
Incidentally, I would like to inform you that I have also begun 
another trial, concerning the same, with GAZETA WYBORCZA. In 
this case things are far less advanced, so it will probably last 
not two years, but perhaps two and a half, or even three. 
However, I think that it will end up very similarly, because it 
is exactly the same problem. 
  [Woyciechowski] Do you think the government members should 
get generous awards of the order of Z100 or 142 million? 
  [Miller] Well, you know.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Have you received any award 
yet? 
  [Miller] If I say no, then some of my government colleagues 
may resent it; if I say yes, then probably the listeners will 
resent it; they will say: well, what does this Miller think he 
is? I will simply tell you how much I earn. I earn Z17 million 
before tax and my net earnings amount to approximately 15 
million. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, you should go on strike. 
  [Miller, laughs] I receive 15 million. Now, this is a 
matter of evaluation whether this is a sufficient salary for a 
minister or not. I certainly realize that there are many Poles 
who earn much less. There is no doubt about that. However, 
there are many who make much more money. I have received one 
award so far; it was an award for the fourth quarter; I received 
it just before Christmas. It was Z20 million, I think. It 
really helped me organize Christmas and New Year's Eve. 
  [Woyciechowski] These are the awards that today's press 
mentions. It indicates that Pawlak also probably used some of 
the money left by Suchocka. 
  [Miller] These are legal regulations. It all results from 
concrete legal acts. Well, it is difficult to imagine a prime 
minister who can pay this money to his civil servants, but does 
not want to do that. I think that there is only one problem 
here: none of this should be secret. This should not be 
enshrouded in a strange mist of secret. Let us speak about this 
bluntly and let the public opinion form a certain view on that. 
  [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview. 
  [Miller] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Krzysztof Dobrowolski, director of the </F>
Ministry of Ownership Transformations Gdansk Agency, by 
correspondent Slawomir Lewandowski; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Lewandowski] The Mass Privatization Program [PPP] 
envisages simultaneous, quick, and inexpensive privatization of 
several hundred large state enterprises. Shares issued by these 
enterprises will be distributed among National Investment Funds. 
The latter are devised as strong blocs of Polish capital groups 
capable of competing effectively in the international arena. 
How many state enterprises have so far declared their readiness 
to join the PPP? 
  [Dobrowolski] At the moment there are two groups of 
enterprises set up according to the relevant Council of 
Ministers act. Together they represent more than 360 state 
enterprises. Currently the Ownership Transformations Ministry is 
completing the list of a third group of joint-stock companies 
which also declare their willingness to take part in the 
privatization program. 
  [Lewandowski] Shares issued by enterprises which want to 
join the PPP will be handed over to the National Investment 
Funds. What will happen then? 
  [Dobrowolski] The National Investment Funds will be faced 
with the task of managing these shares and investing them 
profitably. The shares will be distributed so that one 
strategic investor will be allocated to each enterprise--or, 
rather, one joint venture. 
  [Lewandowski] How many shares will one National Investment 
Fund receive? 
  [Dobrowolski] Each National Investment Fund set up as a 
strategic investor will get 33 percent of enterprises' shares. 
The remaining funds will get 27 percent, and the rest, that is, 
40 percent, will be allocated to joint ventures' employees and 
to the State Treasury. A strategic investor, that is, a 
National Investment Fund with 33 percent of shares in its 
allocated company, will be obliged to encourage the company to 
make profits that should be reflected in its shares. We should 
note here that the form of this encouragement must be in keeping 
with the regulations and provisions of the Commercial Code. 
This means that the investors' proposed operations must be 
approved by the company board. Strategic investors will also 
help draft restructuring programs for their companies and assist 
them in seeking credits in domestic and foreign markets. 
  [Lewandowski] Will the state act as a guarantor when 
companies decide to apply for foreign credits? 
  [Dobrowolski] Probably not, because the National Investment 
Funds will not be set up as state-owned funds. The reason for 
this is that our enterprises--even the best ones--quite often 
have no experience in handling complex operations in 
international financial markets. So we are hoping to encourage 
Western firms, which are perfectly familiar with the principles 
of playing the financial market, to participate in our National 
Investment Funds system. 
  [Lewandowski] Who will select the firms to be entrusted with 
the task of managing their joint-stock companies? 
  [Dobrowolski] These matters will be decided by the Selection 
Committee, which has already started its work. Those firms 
which would like to participate in the Mass Privatization 
Program have already submitted their applications, and the 
Commission has begun to examine their cases. 
  [Lewandowski] Which firms from Gdansk and Elblag 
Voivodships have declared their accession to the PPP? 
  [Dobrowolski] In Gdansk Voivodship we have the following: 
the Gdynia Industrial Construction Company, the Elbud Gdansk SA 
[joint-stock company] Power Engineering Construction Company, 
the Bacutil SA Animal Feed Company, Elmor SA, MEAT SA, the 
Lubiana SA China Tableware Products, and Metrix SA in Tczew. In 
Elblag Voivodship we have the Elzam SA Production and Services 
Company. 
  [Lewandowski] So how many National Investment Funds will you 
create altogether? 
  [Dobrowolski] We estimate that we will set up about 20 
National Investment Funds. It is impossible to be more precise 
at this moment because the exact number will depend on the final 
number of enterprises willing to join the national privatization 
program. 
  [Lewandowski] Let us look at the question of the transfer of 
enterprises' shares to the National Investment Funds. How can 
you avoid a situation whereby the first funds to be set up will 
select for themselves the best joint-stock companies, while the 
rest will have to be satisfied with economically weak firms? 
  [Dobrowolski] That will not happen, because we are planning 
to introduce a "points system" whereby each fund will be able to 
"purchase" a given number of joint ventures with the set number 
of points allocated to it. Thus the order in which the 
available joint ventures will be chosen by individual funds will 
be determined by random selection. In addition, the selection 
of joint ventures will be carried out under the supervision of 
the Antimonopoly Office, which will ensure that no monopolies 
will be created in these circumstances. 
  [Lewandowski] So it looks likely that by the end of this 
year every adult citizen of our country will be able to own 
shares in the National Investment Funds, does it not? Even 
though shareholders will not be given actual possession of their 
shares, but will only be issued with share certificates 
confirming that they are indeed shareholders. Will it be worth 
holding on to these certificates for any length of time? 
  [Dobrowolski] I am convinced that it will. 
  [Lewandowski] But it is inevitable that some 
shareholders--or, rather, certificate holders--will be forced by 
circumstances to sell them. 
  [Dobrowolski] Certainly. The privatization program aims to 
achieve a situation where everybody has an equal chance. And 
that is what will happen. However, it will be difficult for us 
to interfere in individual people's decisions about what they 
want to do with their share certificates. In any case, the 
Stock Exchange experience to date shows that it is certainly 
worthwhile to own shares. 
  [Lewandowski] So, one year after the launch of the National 
Investment Funds, our share certificates will be changed into 
actual shares of the relevant joint ventures and will then be 
eligible for Stock Exchange operations. Consequently, we will 
be able to buy and sell them, and generally to "play" the Stock 
Exchange with them, will we not? And, of course, the general 
public will come to experience capitalism at first hand. 
  [Dobrowolski] That is precisely what we hope will happen. 
Perhaps it will not be possible to sort out the whole question 
smoothly in one go, but we can be sure that the public will 
receive a sound lesson in economic education--certainly much 
sounder than our present knowledge of the subject. 
  [Lewandowski] Will we be able to make money by buying and 
selling those shares? After all, we know that quite a few of 
our enterprises cannot be counted among economic giants.... 
  [Dobrowolski] Of course. However, it is worth stressing 
that access to the PPP will be open only to selected enterprises 
which can guarantee a return of good profit. That is one of the 
basic requirements of PPP membership. 
  [Lewandowski] Let us now consider the following question: I 
have received, or else purchased, National Investment Fund share 
certificates to the value of 10 percent of the average national 
[monthly] wage. What should I do with them now? 
  [Dobrowolski] You can keep them for a while, and then 
exchange them for shares in individual companies and wait until 
their value goes up. You can also sell your share 
certificates.... 
  [Lewandowski] ...by trading outside the Stock Exchange? 
  [Dobrowolski] Yes. 
  [Lewandowski] But we do not have an established market in 
stocks and shares outside the Stock Exchange yet. So I can 
determine the price of my share certificate myself by selling it 
to a friend? 
  [Dobrowolski] Yes, you can. Consequently, your certificate 
will represent an independent market value outside the Stock 
Exchange. 
  [Lewandowski] What about the employees of the budget-funded 
sectors of the economy? Will they also receive share 
certificates? 
  [Dobrowolski] There will be a certain difference there 
because the employees of the budget-funded sector will receive 
additional free share certificates--on top of the entitlement 
due to all citizens, and chosen from selected funds--within the 
terms of their compensatory pay uprating schemes. [Dobrowolski

  [Excerpts] Following a week's break caused by the working 
visit of Vladimir Meciar to the countries of Asia, the Slovak 
Government met in Bratislava today. Deputy Prime Minister Roman 
Kovac and Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Moravcik are not 
taking part in its 85th regular session. It is, however, 
expected that the government will adopt a position today on 
personnel questions concerning the posts of minister of foreign 
affairs and minister for administration and privatization of 
national property of the Slovak Republic. The president of the 
Slovak Republic asked Vladimir Meciar for this yesterday. 
  The president refused to appoint Jozef Prokes minister of 
foreign affairs yesterday. The name of Olga Keltosova, minister 
of labor, social affairs, and the family, is being mentioned in 
this connection, as well as that of Ivan Mjartan, Slovak 
ambassador to the Czech Republic. Olga Keltosova, however, has 
allegedly denied her candidature. According to our information 
from government circles, Eva Mitrova, current head of the 
permanent mission of the Slovak Republic at the Council of 
Europe in Strasbourg, is a hot candidate for the post of 
minister of foreign affairs. 
  The candidate for the post of minister for administration 
and 
privatization of national property, according to Vladimir 
Meciar, has been known to the coalition government for several 
months. As he said recently, he has been waiting to appoint him 
only because the position of the government was not stable and 
he considered the appointment of a minister in these 
circumstances illogical. [passage omitted] 
  Ondrej Hanko, head of the government office press 
department, 
has said the following: 
  [Begin Hanko recording] [passage omitted] In the next part 
of 
the session, the prime minister reported on the president's 
letter, which he had received. In this connection, I would like 
to tell you that I have been empowered to deny yesterday's 
statement by the spokesman of the president of the Slovak 
Republic in which he said that the Slovak prime minister agreed 
that the president did not wish to appoint Deputy Prime Minister 
Prokes to the post of minister of foreign affairs. The prime 
minister never uttered these words at yesterday's talks with the 
president. [passage omitted] 
  The prime minister said that he has decided not to sign the 
bill on big privatization that the government passed to the 
president. He stated that he will pass it to the National 
Council for it to be discussed again. [end recording] 
  This was from the session of the government. [passage 
indistinct]

<F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta: "The Czech UNPROFOR Soldiers </F>
Forces Are Inadequately Armed"] 
  [Excerpt] So far, the Czech soldiers of the UN 
peacekeeping forces, operating on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia, have not been adequately armed. This was 
established by an army inspection headed by Jaromir Novotny, 
director of the Foreign Relations Section at the Defense 
Ministry. 
  The inspection found that, according to the applicable 
tables 
on issue of arms, the soldiers were armed for peace conditions. 
"If something happened, each soldier would certainly have some 
kind of weapon, but we have decided that he will be better 
armed," Novotny said. He emphasized that the army command also 
decided that each UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] battalion will 
have a submachine gun. To date, submachine guns have only been 
used by the soldiers authorized to do so by the appropriate 
standards. 
  Novotny stated that the unit will have guided anti-tank 
missiles at its disposal. 
  The better equipment for the Czech troops will be brought by 
the 117 soldiers who yesterday left the UN peacekeeping forces 
training base in Cesky Krumlov for Karlovac in Croatia.

<F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus </F>
by station editor Lucie Weissova; place not given--live or 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Weissova] Prime Minister, you had talks 
yesterday with Polish Sejm Speaker Mr. Oleksy. At the same 
time, you said that Czech-Polish relations are of absolute 
priority for us. Can you explain why they are more important 
for us than, for example, relations with Slovakia or Germany? 
  [Klaus] I certainly did not say that they are more important 
than relations with Germany or Slovakia. I think that it was 
necessary to use this visit to dispel certain doubts which 
continue to exist on the Polish side. They have lasted for four 
years. If you remember, there was an occasion when we did not 
open small-scale border contacts. On another occasion, we did 
not want to solve the questions (?anew). We almost forgot that. 
And there was something else for the third time. 
  At the moment there have been complications as regards our 
weak attitude toward the Western countries regarding entry to 
NATO and the Partnership for Peace. Part of the Polish press 
continues to create the impression that we want to do something 
against Poland or without Poland and so on. 
  So I am glad that this visit has taken place and I was quite 
conscious in uttering those welcoming sentences, but it 
certainly did not mean putting these relations above Slovakia or 
something like that. 
  [Weissova] Nevertheless, the mass media often criticize our 
government for the relations which it has with its neighbors, 
for example, as far as the countries of Visegrad are concerned, 
they blame the Czech Republic for not wanting to progress in a 
coordinated way, for wanting to be isolated. The kernel of 
discord between us and Austria is Temelin. Relations with 
Germany are complicated by the Sudeten German question and 
criticism of our government appears in the mass media regarding 
its foreign policy toward neighbors. Do you agree that this 
policy does not take sufficient consideration of tactics 
concerning these sensitive questions? 
  [Klaus] I certainly do not agree with it. If we had no 
neighbors we would have no problems with neighbors. [passage 
omitted] I simply cannot agree that our policies are 
irrational, inconsistent, and badly thought out. This is not 
true, and I cannot imagine what kind of policies we should 
conduct for them to be better. Should we go for the Austrian 
blocking of Temelin? Would it be better foreign policy? 
[passage omitted] The fact that we are being criticized by a 
small fraction of the German press, in my view, is evidence that 
we are doing things correctly. 
  [Weissova] Prime Minister, NATO planes have interfered in 
Bosnia. What do you think about this resolute step? Can this 
demonstration of NATO determination contribute toward ending the 
protracted conflict or, on the contrary, worsen it? 
  [Weissova] I do not like to pass absolute judgements 
because, 
as I have understood up to now, or at least up to this morning 
as we are talking, it was not clear at all what kind of planes 
they were, which sides were involved, and what was behind it. 
We know very well that in this strange war there are a lot of 
strange activities by individuals going on which are not 
completely synchronized and coordinated with the others. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Weissova] Events in Hebron on Friday, where a Jewish 
settler, a doctor, shot dozens of praying people, shook the 
world by its scale and manner. You were recently in Israel and 
met its top representatives. You saw the complicated problems 
there: Do you think that this action could jeopardize or make 
it impossible to bring peace to the area? 
  [Klaus] I am worried. I am really worried that this is a 
huge blow to all peace talks. What really makes me concerned is 
my feeling that a massacre on this scale could not be the work 
of one individual, however mad he was. It had to be prepared, 
there had to be some sort of logic and support behind it. This 
is why I am worried that this was not an isolated deed committed 
by someone who deals with problems of the world in this mad way. 
And this is what bothers me. It would indicate that something 
similar can happen again and this is really bad. 
  I have seen the swift reactions of Israel in its obvious 
counter- gesture of releasing thousands of Palestinian captives 
in an attempt to rectify this dreadful deed. 
  I have seen this problem, the internal political conflicts 
in 
the Israeli parliament. I saw there at the same table 
representatives of a group that would never negotiate with 
Palestinians opposite a group which wants the negotiations. I 
am afraid that what happened has added complications to a 
problem which is already difficult. 
  [Weissova] My last question is about coupon privatization in 
the Czech Republic. The completion date for the preparatory 
round of the second wave has been finally set. [passage 
omitted] Why was this preliminary round so long? Was it 
necessary? 
  [Klaus] [passage omitted] All enterprises which are to enter 
the second wave of coupon privatization must have their annual 
accounts settled. This takes time and it could not be done any 
quicker. If this took place three months earlier or later and 
the annual balancing did not come into it, it could have been 
done faster.

  [Text] At the beginning of the bulletin we shall go over to 
the Chamber of Deputies in Prague. Our correspondents Ivana 
Anyzova and Milan Repka have been following today's developments 
there. 
  [Repka] The speaker of the Polish Sejm, Jozef Oleksy, said 
after the talks with Czech parliament speaker Milan Uhde that 
Polish and Czech views of the integrational process into 
European structures and of basic principles on which a united 
Europe should be built were identical. 
  Jozef Oleksy went on to say that some media claims that the 
Czech Republic did not favor regional cooperation within the 
Visegrad Group were regarded as issues of no lesser importance 
and that the Polish side expected to receive an answer to these 
issues. Oleksy added that the explanation the Polish delegation 
received in this respect was satisfactory. 
  Asked by Czech radio whether the Partnership for Peace 
project was also discussed during the meeting with the Czech 
parliament speaker Milan Uhde, Jozef Oleksy said that this issue 
was discussed, too, and that, in his view, the Czech side's 
approach to the signing of this agreement, which was already 
signed by Poland, was rather cautious. In this connection it is 
noteworthy, however, that Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus is to sign 
this agreement on 10 March. 
  Answering a question by a Polish journalist as to whether 
the 
Polish delegation discussed also requests related to the return 
of property to Polish associations, Speaker Oleksy replied that 
he discussed this issue during all his official talks with the 
Czech side. 
  [Anyzova] Regarding this issue, Czech Parliament Speaker 
Milan Uhde told Czech radio that he did not recall that this 
topic had been brought forward during his talks with the Polish 
Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy in the Czech parliament today. Milan 
Uhde then told Czech radio that although this issue has not been 
officialy addressed, he himself was aware that some Polish, 
mostly cultural associations active within the Polish national 
minority, were claiming back the property, which was once 
Polish, including the property of various legal entities which 
was first of all confiscated from these associations by the 
Germans. These associations claim that this property has been 
returned neither by the Czechoslovak nor the Czech Government. 
  According to the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, it is 
not absolutely clear whether this issue goes back before 
February 1948. In conclusion, Milan Uhde added that nobody on 
the Czech side has considered this issue in detail so far.

  [Text] Polish Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy is ending his visit 
to the Czech Republic today. In his talks he learned that the 
Czech Republic does not wish to change the Visegrad Four into a 
lobby for persuading the European structures to accept these 
countries more swiftly. When meeting the press at the end of 
his talks in Prague, the Polish Sejm speaker said that Poland 
also does not wish for the institutionalization of the Visegrad 
Four and acknowledges that the Czech side emphasizes economic 
cooperation. On the other hand, Poland is convinced that the 
Visegrad Group ought to explain jointly to the West European 
countries its urgent need to join the European structures. 
  In an interview for Czech television, the Polish Sejm 
speaker 
spoke about the current situation in Russia and the possibility 
that Russia would like to play the role of superpower also 
within the Partnership for Peace program. Poland must carefully 
follow developments in Russia where democracy is only in its 
initial stages. Poland must draw its conclusions and bring them 
to the Pan-European discussion. 
  In spite of its firm Euro-Atlantic course, in no way could 
Poland neglect its good economic relations with Russia and 
Ukraine because it sees the [word indistinct] future of Polish 
interests in them also, Mr. Oleksy said. 
  Poland and the Czech Republic are of the opinion that only 
democratic Russia should take part in the structures of the 
Europe of the future and in its future security system. A 
Russia with an imperial policy will not fit into the strategy of 
European security, as it is perceived by Poland and the Czech 
Republic, the Polish Sejm speaker said in Prague today.

<F P=106> [CTK report: "An Agreement on Cooperation Between Parties"] </F>
  [Text] Prague--The chairmen and deputy chairmen of the 
Christian Democratic Party [KDS] and the Liberal National Social 
Party [LSNS] reached an agreement yesterday at their first joint 
meeting on consultations between the KDS and LSNS deputies' 
clubs on draft laws and regular cooperation between party 
experts. This information was released by KDS Chairman Ivan 
Pilip and LSNS Chairman Pavel Hirs after their meeting. 
  According to Pilip, their talks focussed on the issue of the 
territorial-administrative arrangement, restitution, the 
approach to returning emigres' property, the election laws, and 
educational and housing matters. He said that the two parties' 
opinions on the issues discussed are very close in the basic 
principles. The only exception is the parties' differing views 
on the elections to the Senate. The KDS prefers 27 electoral 
districts, while the LSNS prefers 81, added Pilip. According to 
the LSNS chairman, yesterday's meeting, the first to be held at 
the party-leadership level, took place out of a mutual need to 
get together. "No one initiated it," said LSNS Chairman Pavel 
Hirs. He added that some things have to be coordinated in 
parliament, while others have to be clarified and "discussed in 
advance" in cooperation with experts. "We want to set an example 
to the other parties and show them that it is possible to 
cooperate and reach a sensible agreement on apparently 
conflicting issues on which opinions differ and that this can be 
done without having to shift from one's own position," said LSNS 
Chairman Pavel Hirs in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Article by "(ivh)": "Our Pistols Are Going on Sale"] </F>
  [Text] Uhersky Brod--"Our company has sold weapons worth 
almost 60 million korunas [Kc] since the beginning of the year, 
which, in view of the long-term trend in sales, gives us good 
prospects for the other months," said Engineer Ivo Janeba, 
commercial director of the Czech Arms Plant Uhersky Brod, to a 
LIDOVE NOVINY reporter yesterday. 
  According to him, the arms plant achieved quite 
extraordinary 
growth last year in the volume of the sales of its products: 
growth of 140 percent, compared with 1992, which amounts to 
almost Kc940 million. Director Janeba said that the biggest 
customer last year (and will also be this year) was the Turkish 
Police Force, which purchased CZ 75 pistols. The Lithuanian 
Interior Ministry is another major foreign partner. "So far, 
the Czech Armed Forces have not made a binding order for our 
products; nevertheless, we anticipate that they will become an 
important partner when the concept for their armament has been 
drafted," said Janeba. The Austrian companies A. Kind and 
Sarnitz, the German Frankonia company, and a series of other 
companies from France, the United States, Israel, Poland, and 
Hungary are among the arms plant's most important partners in 
the civilian market. According to the commercial director, in 
1994 the Czech Arms Plant will be oriented, from the point of 
view of exports, toward the arms markets in Turkey and the 
United States. The plant's most sought-after products include 
the CZ 75 pistols and the CZ 85 9-mm Luger pistol, whose price 
on the U.S. market, for example, is approximately $500. 
  "According to the trends in the price of its shares, the 
Czech Arms Plant is one of the better valued engineering 
enterprises, so it will be interesting for the second wave of 
coupon privatization," says Janeba. The nominal value of a 
single Czech Arms Plant share rose to Kc3,885 at the most recent 
session of the stock market on 17 February. The company was 
privatized to a considerable extent in the first wave; of 
course, there are still 22.5 percent of the shares left for the 
second wave. These shares are owned by the National Property 
Fund.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "V. Klaus Promoted the Czech </F>
Republic Among the German Industrialists"] 
  [Text] Munich--Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus described his 
two-day visit to Munich, which he began on Wednesday [23 
February] at the invitation of the German insurance company 
Allianz and the BMW automobile concern, as a traditional trip 
for the purpose of promoting and explaining development in the 
Czech Republic. 
  On Wednesday night, the Czech prime minister met with 
representatives of the foremost German firms, banks, and 
companies: Commerzbank, Bayer, BASF, Siemens, Hoechst, 
Bertelsmann, GRUNDIG, Thyssen, Krupp, and others. Also present 
were Hans Peter Stihl, chairman of the German Chambers of 
Industry and Commerce (DIHT); Otto Wolf von Amerongen, chairman 
of the Eastern Committee for the German Economy; and former 
Federal President Walter Scheel. 
  During the discussion with the industrialists, Vaclav Klaus 
explained in his own words at what stage of the reform the Czech 
economy is and how it differs from the other postcommunist 
states and the West European countries. The prime minister said 
that his meeting with some 50 representatives of the foremost 
German firms also indicates the increased involvement of the 
Czech Republic in the European economy. The activity of the 
German BMW automobile concern as well as more general economic 
and political relations between the Czech Republic and Germany 
were the topics of yesterday's debate between Vaclav Klaus and 
BMW boss Bernd Pischetsrieder. 
  "We have various subcontractors in the Czech Republic and 
are 
very satisfied with them," Pischetsrieder said after the meeting 
with Vaclav Klaus. He added that BMW intends to develop this 
cooperation further. The Czech prime minister described the 
talks with the concern management as very useful. 
  To the question of Czech-German relations, Vaclav Klaus said 
that "the relations must not remain at the level of talks 
between prime ministers but must also be developed by expanding 
economic contacts."

returned from Albania this evening. At Zagreb Pleso airport the 
president was welcomed by Stipe Mesic, Josip Manolic, Nikica 
Valentic, Janko Bobetko, Gojko Susak, Jure Radic, and other top

told journalists that the talks he held in Tirana were useful 
for the political and economic development of Croatia and 
Albania. Commenting on a meeting between Foreign Minister 
Granic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in Washington, 
President Tudjman said: 
  [Begin recording] [Tudjman] I think that this is a success 
both for our policy and this time also for international policy, 
the European and U.S. ones. This is a success that is leading 
toward peace, which is most important, while it is opening up 
possibilities to Croatia for the resolution of all its problems, 
primarily the speedier resolution of problems regarding Croatian 
territories under UN protection -- in other words, under Serb 
occupation -- and the resolution of all other economic and 
financial problems, which is very important. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Karlo Jeger: "The Most Important Stronghold of </F>
the Serbian Air Force Outside Serbia Is Situated in Croatia!"] 
  [Text] Serbian military aircraft are still flying freely 
above Croatia. Vladimir Desnica, a NOVI LIST reporter, visited 
the occupied territories in Croatia and witnessed yet another 
demonstration of the power of the rebel Serbs. Desnica claims 
that jet planes flew over his head during daytime, in front of 
UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] members! They flew to Knin and 
then proceeded south. This piece of information, which is 
shocking to Croatian citizens, is commonplace for UNPROFOR 
members. According to the information we have received from the 
United Nations there are 12 aircraft of the "Jastreb" type at 
Udbina airport. According to the prewar standards, these 12 
aircraft correspond to the power of a single assault unit. 
UNPROFOR members claim that Krajina aircraft did not fly from 
September 1993 until February 1994. The reason was allegedly a 
shortage of spare parts. 
<H5>  19 Serbian Aircraft on Croatian Territory </H5>
  The attempt to obtain official information about the air 
force owned by rebel Serbs at UNPROFOR headquarters ended with 
the usual response: "No comment." The technologically 
well-equipped UNPROFOR press service, which employs several 
dozen people, does not want to know what is going on in UN 
Protected Areas. There are reports by UN members directly in 
these areas, but they can hardly be used as a basis for the 
estimation of the technical equipment and the legal status of 
the Serbian aircraft (these areas should have been demilitarized 
according to the Vance plan). It is known today that many 
UNPROFOR members cannot differentiate a gun from a howitzer, let 
alone different types of combat planes. More than a year ago, 
an UNPROFOR officer informed, for example, of large-scale 
movements of Croatian "Leopard" tanks toward the front in the 
south. The information that the Croatian Army has these modern 
German tanks created panic among rebel Serbs. The case had a 
banal epilogue, since it was established that these were trophy 
tanks from World War II on which Croatian soldiers had written 
"Leopard." This means that the information sent by UNPROFOR 
members from the front has to be taken with a pinch of salt. 
  Unfortunately, the information that the Serbs in the 
so-called "republic of Serbian Krajina" have a certain number of 
aircraft that fly over the UN Protected Areas without any 
restrictions, is quite reliable. 
  There are three large airports remaining in the occupied 
Croatian territory that can hold Serbian jet planes. The former 
Osijek airport was occupied by the Yugoslav People's Army 
already at the beginning of the war. After certain parts of the 
Yugoslav People's Army withdrew, Osijek airport, the only 
airport in Slavonia -- which has the official name of Klisa 
airport now, taking the name of the nearby village -- was given 
to chetniks and later it became the UNPROFOR headquarters for 
Sector East. Since it was thoroughly cleaned out, like all 
other airports at which the Yugoslav People's Army was based, it 
is out of use at the moment. Only the runway can be used for 
training purposes. 
  Bihac airport, which became a part of the Croatian territory 
after the Yugoslav People's Army withdrew, was completely 
destroyed in a spectacular mining operation controlled from a 
helicopter. The $5 billion investment was blown into the air 
and it is out of use now. A whole wing of MiG-21's was 
transferred from Bihac airport to Ponikve airport near Uzice in 
Serbia and most of the equipment and devices, as well as 
technical personnel, were transferred to the airport on the 
other side of Pljesivica Mountain, near Udbina. Udbina airport, 
which the Yugoslav People's Army constructed as a reserve 
warbase, thus became the westernmost Serbian airbase. The 
decision to occupy Udbina airport was taken for tactical 
reasons. Other airports are situated too close to demarcation 
lines. 
  After the Vance plan for Croatia was signed and the 
cease-fire reached, it seemed that Udbina airport would not have 
any special importance. For some time it served civilian 
purposes. The KOS [the former Yugoslav intelligence service] 
members who participated in the "Opera" action organized a 
regular flight service between Belgrade and Udbina by Yugoslav 
Air Force planes. After some "Opera" members were arrested, the 
regular air traffic between Belgrade and Udbina was given up, 
too. With the escalation of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
especially after the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina became a 
no-fly zone, the military importance of Udbina airport 
increased. During the first several days after the ban was 
imposed, the Serbs, as usual, completely ignored this 
requirement of the international community. Since the beginning 
of 1993, however, when NATO aircraft started controlling Bosnian 
airspace, the Serbs have reduced their activities in the air to 
the use of helicopters and transferred some of their aircraft to 
Croatia. 
  In fact, Serbian planes and helicopters flew -- in spite of 
the ban -- from the Bosnian airspace to the occupied Croatian 
territories all the time. They were not stopped by UN monitors 
who were stationed at all active airports. 
  Since it cannot be established how often Serbian aircraft 
are 
still flying from Bosnia to Croatia, neither can it be precisely 
stated how strong the Air Force led by Milan Martic is. 
  It is known, however, that Serbs have more than 12 aircraft 
in the occupied Croatian territory. Apart from that, they have 
helicopters. 
  Already at the time when the so-called UN Protected Areas 
were being established, Serbs painted the helicopters of the 
former Yugoslav People's Army blue, trying to declare them as 
helicopters of the local police forces. The Knin Police thus 
got a large number of "Mi-8" transporting helicopters of Russian 
origin as well as "Gazella" combat helicopters for antitank 
actions and for reconnaissance purposes. At the same time, 
there were several old- fashioned attack airplanes of the 
"Jastreb" type, and several trainer planes of the "Galeb" type 
at Udbina airport. They had been already almost out of use 
since their maintenance level was below the technical minimum. 
This was confirmed at the air show, organized above Benkovac 
Barracks several months ago, during which one of the "Gazellas" 
split in the air. The members of the crew were badly wounded. 
Captain Suput later died from injuries. 
<H5>  Pilots From Lika Villages </H5>
  This situation in the Knin Air Force represents the general 
chaos, poverty, and anarchy in the regions ruled by rebel Serbs. 
Like other Krajina leaders, Lieutenant Bubalo, the commander of 
Martic's Air Force, has a large apartment in Belgrade. His wife 
and children live there. 
  Most of the pilots of the Krajina Air Force stem from Lika 
villages; after the Vance plan was signed they have been working 
more on activities necessary for survival, such as in 
agriculture, than on maintaining their flying capacity. 
  The announcement of a NATO intervention in Bosnia has again 
enhanced the importance of Udbina airport. Before the NATO 
ultimatum was issued, General Ratko Mladic, the commander of the 
Bosnian Serb Army, visited the occupied Croatian areas. He also 
visited the Knin headquarters of General Novakovic. Soon after 
this visit, Milan Martic, the new "president" of the "republic 
of Serbian Krajina," gave a statement on the necessity of close 
connections between Western Serbian countries, and Udbina 
airport was reactivated at the same time. Serbian combat jet 
planes started flying to the training polygon situated near the 
occupied town of Benkovac. They have been practicing classic 
maneuvers of reaching a destination at rooftop level as well as 
various maneuvers for bombing and rocket attacks. 
  The sudden reactivation of Udbina airport can be explained 
in 
two ways: The Serbian pilots from Bosnia have either come to 
the airport in order to refresh their skills, since they had a 
break of several months, or they have come here in order to 
prepare themselves for a response in case of NATO air strikes. 
It was stated that the Serbs can reach the NATO air base in 
Aviano only from Udbina airport. 
  Udbina airport is not a serious threat to Croatia. After the 
successful action in the Medak area, this airport is now within 
the reach of Croatian artillery. 
  More important is, however, the attitude the Federal 
Republic 
of Yugoslavia has toward this airport, which is situated deep 
within the internationally recognized borders of Croatia. 
  The Ministry of Traffic of every country issues the IAP 
[International Airport] publication for its airspace. It is 
used by pilots and flying personnel since it contains 
information on airports and infrastructure important for 
activities in the air. The Belgrade Ministry of Traffic, with 
which Croatia is now negotiating about the reestablishment of 
telephone lines, has declared Udbina airport one of the official 
Yugoslav airports in this publication -- apart from the Belgrade 
and Nis airports. The official code of Udbina airport is LYUD, 
and its telephone number is 078-76800.

<F P=106> [Report by TANJUG correspondent Savo Jankovic from Knin] </F>
  [Text] The first plenary session of the first regular 
meeting of the assembly of the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] 
concluded this afternoon by electing members of seven 
parliamentary committees. The unanimous election of the 
commission members was preceded by the consultations held by the 
heads of caucuses, where a complete coordination was reached 
about the (?composition) of the committees, something that 
Assembly Chairman Branko (Vodnjica) stated with pleasure at the 
beginning of the afternoon part of the session. Immediately 
after the assembly committees were constituted, the first 
constitutive sessions of some of them were held while the 
remaining committees will do that by tomorrow morning. 
  The second plenary session is expected in the afternoon, 
which will most probably discuss the Krajina negotiatory 
platform in the peace process, amendments to which were 
initiated by President Milan Martic. By the way, at the morning 
part of the session today, Martic presented a report on the 
current political and security situation in Krajina. One may 
expect the plenary session [tomorrow] to discuss Martic's speech 
and there is also the possibility of the government submitting 
its report on the same topic. Moreover, the government is 
expected to submit a proposal on legal documents or ordinances 
regarding Krajina joining the united balance of payments with 
the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], monetary 
reconstruction, and economic recovery.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 14 February issue of the Split daily 
SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, in an article entitled "The Return of 
Comrade Veljko" on page 5, criticizes the appointment of Veljko 
Knezevic as head of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] 
diplomatic office in Zagreb. "Croats know who Veljko Knezevic 
is.... As an arrogant chief of the central committee -- as well 
as the chief of SDB [State Security Service] operations -- he 
was tasked with creating political conditions in Croatia that 
would benefit the Serbs, both natives of Croatia and newcomers," 
SLOBODNA DALMACIJA states, adding that the return of Knezevic to 
the "scene of the crime" and the forcing of Croats to accept a 
"criminal" as "ambassador" contains "Milosevic's true message of 
reconciliation and forgiveness." The paper remarks that, with 
this appointment, Milosevic, the "Belgrade mass murderer," shows 
a sense of humor typical of "sadistic maniacs" who in 
"committing their crimes ridicule their victims."

  [Text] Belgrade, 2 Mar (TANJUG) -- Federal Foreign Affairs 
Minister Vladislav Jovanovic today said that yesterday's 
Croat-Muslim agreement could be positive if it were to lead to 
an end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Talking to reporters in the federal assembly, Jovanovic 
stressed that he was not familiar with the crux of the agreement 
but he nevertheless cautioned that nothing good would come out 
of the agreement if it constituted a block of two sides in 
opposition to the third side, the Serbs, along the lines of 
"take it or leave it." 
  "In that case the agreement would be no contribution to 
peace 
-- on the contrary," Jovanovic said. In his words, the signing 
of the agreement may mean that the Croats and Muslims abandoned 
"what was agreed at an earlier stage in Geneva." 
  "Depending on the essence of this agreement, the Serbian 
side 
will formulate its attitude to it," Jovanovic said.

<F P=106> ["Pool" report by Sinisa Lepojevic] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, March 1 (TANJUG) -- Judging by the facts 
of the real life and the war reality, the Moslem-Croat 
confederation in the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, under discussion in Washington for the past 
three days, will be practically impossible to achieve. 
  Well-informed sources and diplomats are aware of that, as 
are 
most probably its initiators in Washington, and by doing so they 
are consciously drawing Bosnia further away from peace and an 
end of the war. The idea is basically also directed against the 
interests of the Bosnian Moslems. 
  The ten-month war between the Bosnian Moslems and Croats has 
reached such horrible proportions that its cruelty surpasses all 
previous wars and has broken up all alliances between these two 
peoples, i.e. their political leaders. The key issue is central 
Bosnia, the scene of fierce battles between the Moslems and 
Croats over control of mixed territories and arms factories. 
  This part of Bosnia is the essence of life of the Bosnian 
Croats in that ex-Yugoslav republic. It was inhabited by over 
400,000 Croats, 200,000 of whom fled before the clashes with the 
Moslems, while the death toll remains unknown. 
  The worst Moslem atrocities against the civilians were 
committed in this region, while the Bosnian Croat forces (HVO) 
carried out massacres over the Moslems, especially in the area 
of Vares, Vitez, Gornji Vakuf and Prozor. 
  The Bosnian Croats have demolished Mostar which, after the 
Serbs were forced to leave, became a predominantly Moslem town. 
One wonders if a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia is possible 
from that viewpoint. 
  The fact remains that the idea for a federation comes from 
abroad and that the negotiatiors are under terrible pressure. 
Regardless of the outcome, these talks represent the defeat of 
the policy of Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and his party, 
the Croatian Democratic Union (H.D.Z.). One should recall that 
the major disputes in [word indistinct] occured over central 
Bosnia, which is now virtually lost because a federation implies 
the maintaining of actual state of affairs. [as received] 
  This discord within HDZ was stemmed from the insistence of 
the Bosnian branch of H.D.Z. on maintaining central Bosnia as a 
"basis" of Croat population, while western Herzegovina, in which 
Zagreb was mainly interested, was "ethnically clean" even before 
the start of the war and had very loose links with Sarajevo. 
  The United States' excuse that this kind of federation would 
solve the problem of the Moslem access to the sea is also 
invalid, because part of the coast of former Bosnia-Herzegovina 
has been ethnically clean, i.e. Croat-populated, for a long time. 
  Simultaneously, the urging of a new federation by the United 
States, former defender of the Bosnian Moslems, proves that the 
Moslems are the winners in the war with the Croats, and are thus 
in a superior position. 
  On the other hand, the United States, which until now has 
undermined all peace efforts by insisting on a so-called intact 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, now admits that division is inevitable. 
This represents a defeat of Bosnian Moslem leader Alija 
Izetbegovic, if he is the one who makes any decisions at all. 
  This only proves that the Bosnian Serbs were right in 
insisting that it [words indistinct] who in fact does not want a 
Bosnian Moslem state. 
  Furthermore, it is unclear what will happen to the 
autonomous 
province of Western Bosnia, Moslem enclave in northwest Bosnia. 
Judging by the current state of affairs, if a Moslem-Croat 
federation came to life, this part of Bosnia called Cazinska 
Krajina would very likely become autonomous within the Bosnian 
Serb republic. 
  The question is what could this federation mean for the 
Bosnian Serbs. [words indistinct] ways for its setting up 
primarily recognize the sovereignty and independence of the 
Bosnian Serbs within Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
  On the other hand, if such a community was a threat to 
Bosnian Serb interests and could provoke yet another [words 
indistinct] major Croat-Serb clashes would be bound to happen, 
and concerning the latest Russian initiatives in the Balkans, 
the fighting could have tragic consequences primarily for 
Europe, as well as for the whole world. 
  Regardless of what led the United States to insist on this 
idea, its realization certainly does not accept reality and the 
actual state of the affairs, and simultaneously draws 
Bosnia-Herzegovina away from the much desired peace.

<F P=106> [Article by "M.N.": "Tudjman as a Lesser of Two Evils"] </F>
  [Text] The Muslims in Bosnia have paid dearly for their 
naivete and alliance with the Croats. Conscious of the fact 
that he has been militarily defeated in this former Yugoslav 
republic, Franjo Tudjman is now offering the Muslim people a 
federation with the Croats and a confederation with the Republic 
of Croatia. 
  Although he does not care much for Muslims, he is doing this 
because he is under pressure from the United States and is 
hoping to create a military counterbalance to Serbia. At the 
moment, for him, the alliance is the lesser of two evils. 
Moreover, he was the one who flatly refused all proposals for a 
Bosnian-Croatian union. 
  This was stated yesterday by Rasim Ljajic, head of the 
Sandzak branch of the Party for Democratic Action [SDA], who 
said that Tudjman was still counting on good relations with 
Milosevic and the return of the lost territories in the Krajina. 
Ljajic advised his compatriots in Bosnia to think before 
entering into any kind of alliance with the Croats.

  [Text] FRY President Lilic held a news conference for 
foreign journalists in the International Press Center in 
Belgrade at noon today. Without Yugoslavia's stabilization 
there is no stabilization in the Balkans and beyond, he said. He 
resolutely denied any link between the Air Force of the Yugoslav 
Army and yesterday's incident in Bosnian skies. Here is a 
report by Slobodan Jankovic: 
  [Begin recording] [Jankovic] Before about 100 foreign 
correspondents, President Lilic first presented a basic layout 
of the FRY policy regarding the crisis in the Balkans. 
Afterwards, he answered a dozen questions. 
  Speaking about the most important pillars of our policy, 
Zoran Lilic said the following: 
  [Lilic] The consistent policy of the FRY has, all the time, 
and is still based on two key aims. The first is a political 
aim and it consists of the maximum effort for the FRY to make 
its full contribution to establish peace. These are the 
activities that we have been carrying out continuously since the 
breakout of the crisis on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia. The second aim is the economic one: Regardless of 
the drastic situation in the region, our country is going to 
stabilize its economy through (?real) deep structural changes in 
the monetary sphere, managing capital, mobilizing (?idle) 
capacities through the share-holding system, and, certainly, the 
functioning of the market of capital, and the reform of the 
taxation system. The economic program that began to be 
implemented on 24 January has as its aim realization of these 
very changes and it is evident that it has yielded good initial 
results. You know very well that inflation, or to put it better, 
hyperinflation was over 300 million percent, only to be reduced 
to about 1 percent during February and this is that right road 
that we are going to go along toward the (?stabilization) of our 
economy. Finally, it is logical to expect that everything that 
the FRY has done on the plane of stabilizing the situation in 
these regions, complying to everything that was demanded from it 
through the UN Security Council resolutions, as well as all the 
measures undertaken at the moment in the economic sphere, should 
now make the international community change its attitude toward 
us, whereby a recovery of the FRY and a peaceful future for the 
generations that have been unjustly put in the situation of 
living in isolation and under pressure would be made possible. 
I am convinced that only an economically recovered Yugoslavia 
can be of use to Europe and the world in general, because, 
without a stable Yugoslavia, I am deeply convinced there can be 
no stability in the Balkans or in the broader territories around 
us. 
  [Jankovic] In reply to the question by a correspondent of 
the Chinese agency about yesterday's incident in the Bosnian 
skies, President Lilic said the following: 
  [Lilic] I am convinced that you know of the announcement 
that was issued by the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army. I, 
as a supreme commander of the Yugoslav Army, can only confirm 
that, for a full two years, that is, since the constitution of 
the FRY, not a single aircraft has taken off from the territory 
of the FRY and flown to the region of the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  What I would like to say is that I personally condemn any 
gesture that leads to an escalation of the conflict and any use 
of force by any side. This is only one more argument that 
negotiations need be accelerated and that we need peace and not 
war. It is obvious that there are people who want to provoke a 
continuation of war and new clashes on the territory of the 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina. I can say with certainty that there 
have not been, and will not be, any such provocations. Our only 
task and aim is to continue the policy we have been leading. 
  [Jankovic] Correspondents of foreign media in Belgrade have 
asked the FRY president about Belgrade's assessments of the war 
in Bosnia, unification with the Serbian Republic and the 
Republic of Serbian Krajina, as well as about relations with the 
former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, 1 March (TANJUG) -- Commenting on the 
downing of planes near Banja Luka yesterday, FRY [Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia] President Zoran Lilic said today that 
"not a single aircraft has flown toward Bosnia-Herzegovina from 
FRY territory for two years now, i.e, since the FRY was set up." 
  In reply to a question about the incident near Banja Luka, 
Lilic pointed out that NATO was in the best position to say what 
had happened because NATO used AWACS monitoring systems that 
should know where the planes took off and where they landed. 
Lilic said that the FRY was against the use of force regardless 
of who used it.

  [Text] Belgrade, Mar 1 (TANJUG) -- The Foreign Ministry of 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) on Tuesday strongly 
condemned the recent unprovoked terrorist act in the mosque in 
Hebron which caused many innocent Palestinian casualties. 
  This senseless act has struck a fierce blow to the 
Palestinian-Israeli peace process, the Foreign Ministry said in 
a statement and added that it was in the interest of the people 
of Palestine and Israel to do everything in order to avoid that 
this incident leads to the increase of tension and escalation of 
the conflict. 
  Consistent to the principles of the peaceful resolution of 
conflicts as the only way to effectively solve problems in the 
international community, the F.R.Y. underscores the importance 
of continuing peace talks between Israel and the PLO with the 
aim of establishing a just and stable peace in the Middle East, 
the statement said.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 1 (TANJUG) -- The international 
economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
have had the most devastating effects in the area of transport 
and communications, where direct losses have reached the figure 
of nearly ten billion dollars over the past 21 months, Federal 
Minister of Transport and Communications Zarko Katic said in an 
interview to TANJUG. 
  The figure does not include the losses incurred to the 
neighbouring and other European countries, which had to by-pass 
Yugoslavia's shortest and cheapest roads and railway lines 
leading to western Europe and the Middle East. 
  "By sealing the Yugoslav borders, the architects of the 
(U.N.) resolutions have also sealed Europe," said Katic. 
  A series of unilateral traffic suspensions was initiated by 
Germany in December 1991, when it discontinued its air traffic 
with Yugoslavia, disregarding all international norms. 
  Yugoslavia has been placed under a total traffic isolation 
on 
the basis of United Nations Security Council resolutions in May 
1992 and April 1993. 
  Yugoslavia was forced to compensate a part of the losses 
through road and navigation tolls, said Katic. Most branches of 
transport and communications faced a total collapse. 
  Vessels of the shipping companies Jugooceanija and 
Prekookeanska Plovidba - which, in cooperation with the port of 
Bar, had secured one fourth of the foreign currency earnings of 
the Republic of Montenegro before the sanctions - are currently 
blocked in ports throughout the world. 
  Another example is the Yugoslav railways, which in 1993 
cancelled 46 passenger and 30 cargo trains daily at the average. 
The restrictions were ofter caused by problems in obtaining 
fuel and spare parts, whose imports are banned.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav </F>
Jovanovic by Oliver Vujovic; place and date not given: 
"Belgrade's Foreign Minister: `No Sanctions Against Croatia'"] 
  [Text] [Vujovic] In the next few days, the office of the 
FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] in Zagreb and the office of 
the Republic of Croatia in Belgrade will be opened. Does this 
mean that the war between the Serbs and Croats is over? 
  [Jovanovic] The war has come to an end and both sides are of 
the opinion that peace and prosperity are only possible with 
normal relations. Thus, the opening of the offices in Belgrade 
and Zagreb follows from it. Experience has shown that the 
results of direct talks between the two sides are far more 
successful than is the case if a third side, foreign countries, 
interfere. The offices are only the first step to mutual 
recognition. 
  [Vujovic] The greatest problem are the borders within the 
former Yugoslavia.... 
  [Jovanovic] The FRY does not have any territorial claims 
against its neighbors. Thus, there is no border problem between 
us and the former Yugoslav republics. However, the problem is 
that individual republics have deprived the Serbian people who 
have lived in these territories for centuries of the right to 
decide on their future. It is the same right that these 
republics used for themselves in order to become independent. 
We do not have any territorial interests, but we only want to 
protect the interests of the Serbs who live there. However, the 
Serbs, for example, in the Krajina, can only decide on their 
future alone. All the problems there can only be solved in 
direct negotiations between Zagreb and Knin. We will accept 
what is decided there. 
  [Vujovic] Does Belgrade have an influence on the Serbs in 
the Krajina? 
  [Jovanovic] Of course, we have a certain influence on the 
Serbs outside the FRY, but one must not underestimate this 
influence. 
  [Vujovic] The question of the prisoners of war is certainly 
one of the most important humanitarian questions at the moment. 
What is the present situation? 
  [Jovanovic] We started to solve this problem as early as a 
year and a half ago. At that time, we signed a document that 
all prisoners are to be exchanged. However, as we ascertained 
later, the Croatian side did not release all its prisoners of 
war or, more precisely, not all were on the list. Therefore, 
these talks will be repeated. 
  There are currently no Croatian prisoners of war on our 
side. 
On the other hand, however, we have a list of about 1,000 
people, most of them missing persons from the former Yugoslav 
People's Army. The Croatian side is prepared to examine this 
list once again, to ascertain finally whether these people are 
still alive. A commission of the two states is to investigate 
this. We are also offering our help to rule out the possibility 
that someone was forgotten or incorrectly registered by us. 
  [Vujovic] An issue that arises again and again is the 
question of property rights.... 
  [Jovanovic] In the Geneva conference there is a commission 
that is responsible for the legal succession of the former 
Yugoslavia. While the individual seceded republics advocate the 
thesis that all the republics of the former Yugoslavia and the 
FRY are together the legal successors of the SFRY, we take 
another view. The FRY did not secede from the former Yugoslavia. 
Therefore, we are not a legal successor, but the state with the 
basic right. The second problem is FRY citizens' private 
property that is in today's Croatia and Slovenia. There are 
numerous houses, apartments, and summer houses with all their 
furniture and equipment, which were confiscated or even 
destroyed by the Croats. Our citizens must be able to enforce 
the right to this property, which belongs to them. 
  [Vujovic] The interrupted relations resulted in many 
problems in the life of the Serbs in Zagreb, Istria, Dalmacija, 
as well as in the life of the Croats in Serbia.... 
  [Jovanovic] I must stress that far more Serbs lived in 
Croatia until Croatia's declaration of independence. Many of 
these Serbs had to leave Croatia, and were often threatened. 
According to our estimates, only 100,000 Serbs are living in 
Croatia today, while up to 300,000 Serbs experienced "ethnic 
cleansing." Most of these expelled Serbs are living as refugees 
in the FRY, which is particularly difficult for us because of 
the UN sanctions. All who want to return must be able to do so. 
They should also have the right to their apartments and all 
their other rights. 
  [Vujovic] Because of the participation of Croatian troops 
and soldiers in the Bosnian war, UN sanctions against Croatia 
were also demanded. What do you say to that? 
  [Jovanovic] No, no new UN sanctions should be introduced, 
but the existing ones should be lifted. For the embargo against 
us, which has been in force for two years, has shown one thing: 
Such a thing does not serve peace, but it only aggravates the 
situation. 
  [Vujovic] Can the visit of a higher-ranking Croatian 
politician be expected in Belgrade soon, for example, a visit by 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to Belgrade or by Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic to Zagreb? 
  [Jovanovic] There had already been high-level contacts 
before this normalization. So far, President Milosevic and 
President Tudjman have had several meetings within the framework 
of the Geneva peace negotiations. We expect Croatian Deputy 
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mate Granic to visit 
Belgrade soon. It is only a question of when a meeting will be 
held on an even higher level in Belgrade or Zagreb.

  [Text] Belgrade, Mar 1 (TANJUG) -- The Republic of Serb 
Krajina (RSK) and the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS) will be a part 
of the single payments system with the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) as of March. 
  On January 24, the Yugoslav Government began implementing 
its 
monetary system reconstruction and economic stabilization 
program. A new dinar, fully backed by gold and foreign exchange, 
was issued in stead of the old inflationary dinar. 
  Payment operations of the F.R.Y. with the RSK and the RS 
have 
not been discontinued in the meanwhile, but were carried out in 
old dinars. 
  As it was announced, the RSK government will at the session 
of its parliament on Tuesday suggest the urgent adoption of laws 
and regulations which will make possible the RSK's joining of 
the single payments system with the F.R.Y. 
  RSK Prime Minister Djordje Bjegovic said the greatest 
difficulties are expected in the implementation of tax policy 
measures and in the domain of customs. 
  The RSK was proclaimed on predominantly Serb populated areas 
in Croatia in 1991 in response to Croatia's forcible secession 
from the former Yugoslav federation and its attempt to downgrade 
the status of the Serbian people to one of national minority. 
It has been a U.N. protected area (UNPA) since March 1992. 
  The RS was set up by Serbs in 1992 on their ethnical and 
historical territories in the former Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
  Since Monday, February 28, the RS has been in the single 
payments system with the F.R.Y., Bosnian Serb Prime Minister 
Vladimir Lukic said. 
  "The republican government has harmonized and adopted all 
provisions from the F.R.Y.'s monetary system reconstruction and 
economic revival program," Lukic said. 
  It is now only a matter of technique, he added, when the new 
Yugoslav dinar will appear as the only means of payment in the 
RS.

  [Text] A public communique issued by the Kosova Democratic 
Alliance [LDK] Presidency condemns the murder of Selman Daci by 
the Serbian Army at Hani i Elezit and considers it as an 
organized state crime of Serbia against Albanians. 
  The communique states that whenever the international 
community undertakes concrete steps against the Serbian policy 
and Serbia, such as the case of downing of four Serbian aircraft 
in the war in Bosnia, the Belgrade regime increases the police 
and military repression against the Albanians in Kosova. 
  Alongside the repression, raids, imprisonments, and daily 
harassments by the Serbian police, yesterday's murder in Hani i 
Elezit seems to warn the escalation of organized state terror 
with unprecedented consequences for Kosova and the Balkan 
region. The LDK Presidency warns the international public that, 
besides the increase of police forces, movements of considerable 
military forces that check the unarmed population have recently 
been observed in Kosova.

  [Text] The Ministry of Urban Planning, Civil Engineering, 
Transport, and Ecology today received a letter from the relevant 
bodies of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] saying that, 
as of 2 March, airplanes belonging to the majority of Macedonian 
airlines will be banned from overflying Yugoslav territory. 
This refers to Palair-Macedonia [Macedonian flag-carrier], 
Vardar-Air, Macedonia-As, Avio-Impex, Meta, and Falcon. The 
reason for the ban, as the letter says, is the huge outstanding 
debt for the servicing of these airlines' overflights. 
  We have learned from our ministry that contact with Yugoslav 
bodies was established; they were called on to postpone the 
implementation of the decision by at least one month in order to 
enable the companies to repay their debts. 
  The letter also says that the same measure was applied to 
airlines from Bulgaria and Turkey that have incurred arrears in 
payments.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Closed Border--Harmful Consequences"] </F>
  [Text] Macedonia's [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] President Kiro Gligorov yesterday received 
the State Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany Helmut 
Schafer. The talks were also attended by Macedonia's Foreign 
Minister. 
  On this occasion, they exchanged opinions regarding the 
strengthening of the cooperation between the two countries and 
the current situation in the region. It was jointly assessed 
that the latest Greek measures, namely the closing of the 
border, are illegal, harmful, and that they can cause vast 
consequences to the stability in the region. 
  Gligorov expressed full readiness of Macedonia to resume the 
Macedonian-Greek negotiations within the framework of the UN, 
without previous conditions and pressure. 
  Mr. Schafer yesterday held talks with Foreign Minister Stevo 
Crvenkovski. The two politicians exchanged opinions regarding 
the situation on the Balkans and the mutual bilateral 
cooperation and the possibilities for its strengthening. 
  Minister Crvenkovski briefed the German guest on Macedonia's 
international activities and the efforts for its admission to 
the international institutions. It was jointly concluded that 
there are many possibilities for a development of the bilateral 
relations and economic cooperation. 
  Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski informed Mr. Schafer of 
the 
latest government measures in relation to the transformation of 
the Macedonian economy, particularly in the implementation of 
the programme for economic stabilization, as well as the 
difficulties Macedonia is facing since the introduction of the 
economic embargo by Greece. 
  Mr. Schafer expressed hope that the newly developed 
situation, following the embargo, will be overcome with an aim 
of normalizing the transport of goods and services on the 
southern Macedonian border.

Order Arrests To Quell Revolt in Army"] 
  [Text] The KONTINENT correspondent in Khaskovo reported 
that dozens of garrisons throughout the country are allegedly 
supporting the petition that the coordinators and chairman of 
clubs of the Rakovski Officers Legion have been organizing 
during the past few days. The main demand in the petition is 
that 37 billion leva should be allocated to defense, in line 
with the estimate submitted by the General Staff. The Legion's 
members also demand that the new defense act should contain 
provisions regulating servicemen's civil rights. 
  Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov reportedly reacted 
very 
strongly and ordered measures to be taken against a revolt in 
the army. The organizers of the petition escaped arrest by a 
hair's breadth, KONTINENT was informed by a source who preferred 
to remain anonymous. 
  Valentin Aleksandrov, Chief Military Prosecutor Lilko 
Yotsov, 
and Military Counterintelligence chief Colonel Stoyanov held a 
high-level meeting recently in Sofia to discuss the situation. 
On Saturday 26 February Chief of General Staff General Lyuben 
Petrov is reported to have summoned representatives of the 
Rakovski Legion. They reportedly assured him that they had no 
intention to raise a revolt and destabilize the army. The chief 
of General Staff also received assurances that the Legion would 
continue to observe the agreement signed with the defense 
minister that rules out the use of force to resolve disputed 
issues. 
  The initiators of the petition told KONTINENT correspondent 
Aleksandur Bozhkov that the petition will continue, and it will 
be handed in to parliament in a civilized manner. 
  President Zhelev and Prime Minister Berov were briefed by 
Defense Minister Aleksandrov on the situation among the troops.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 2 (AFP) -- A UN spokesman reported 
fighting Wednesday [2 March] within the 20-kilometre (12-mile) 
artillery exclusion zone around Sarajevo. 
  UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Canadian Lieutenant-Colonel 
Bill Aikman said there were reports that Bosnian Serb forces had 
attacked near the town of Vrbovik in the northwest part of the 
exclusion zone. The report was confirmed by UN military 
observers and Canadian reconnaissance troops. 
  The mainly Moslem Bosnian Army said Serbs had fired 
artillery 
from within the exclusion zone. Aikman said it was possible the 
artillery fire had come from outside the zone and that UN troops 
were investigating this. 
  Aikman said the NATO-mandated artillery withdrawal from in 
and around Sarajevo and a ceasefire in effect since February 9 
were being generally observed although there were minor 
violations.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 1 (AFP) -- UN commander for Bosnia 
British General Michael Rose is to meet Serb and mainly Moslem 
Bosnian military officers Wednesday to discuss ceasefire 
violations, an aide to Rose told AFP. 
  British Lieutenant Colonel Simon Shadbolt, military 
assistant 
to Rose, said Bosnian forces have at some sites advanced their 
front-line positions against besieging Serbs by 10 metres 
(yards). He said Rose would ask the Bosnians to return to their 
original positions. 
  Shadbolt said UNPROFRO has guaranteed the Serbs that the 
Moslems will not advance their lines, or mount an infantry 
attack, while it enforces a NATO exclusion zone that required 
Serb troops to pull their heavy artillery away from Sarajevo. 
The meeting is to be at Sarajevo airport at about noon (1100 
GMT), Shadbolt said. 
  UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Canadian 
Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman had said earlier Tuesday that 
while a ceasefire was generally holding in Sarajevo there were 
reports of trench-digging by Bosnian troops in attempts to 
advance their lines. He said violations on the Serb side 
consisted of sniper fire and that there had been small-arms 
shooting on both sides.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcela Doleckova: "The Sun Is Rising in the </F>
East: Trade (Not Only) With Russia Is Picking Up"] 
  [Text] The times when a protocol on mutual deliveries was 
signed once a year, and when, after that, Czech enterprises 
expedited goods in a "standard" way to the Soviet market, are 
gone forever. The times when Czech enterprises waited 
fruitlessly (and are still waiting) for payments--again in a 
"standard" way--are also gone. It seems that the era of genuine 
standard trade, without the quotation marks, has arrived. The 
trading conditions, however, may not be quite standard yet, but 
Czech manufacturers and exporters are rapidly learning to tackle 
them. 
<H5>  A Small Exporter Myth? </H5>
  From the naivete of the questions that some Czech 
entrepreneurs are asking of the Mixed Chamber of Commerce "East" 
it can be inferred that small exporters are really a myth. If 
someone who is interested in the Russian market is inquiring 
whether there are custom fees in Russia, what can be sold there, 
and who buys what, then he has no great chances. Maybe it is 
this naivete that makes the Chamber prepare more educational 
courses for Czech entrepreneurs--the beginners. The chairman of 
the Chamber, Josef Cerny, as well as its secretary general, 
Miroslav Cuker, are stressing that small exporters do not have 
do be a myth, however, a completely unexperienced exporter is 
certainly a myth. All those who have successes on the Russian 
market today have experience and know their territory. If an 
exporter knows what products he wants to export, when he has an 
idea about the price and the quality, then he can much profit 
from the Chamber. The Chamber is connected to a network of 
about 60 regional chambers in Russia, and through them our 
Chamber "releases" information onto the Russian market. The 
Chamber has a secretariat in Moscow that, every month, publishes 
the offers of the Czech and Slovak entrepreneurs, and mails them 
to about 3,000 addresses. Anyway, any Czech entrepreneur can 
buy the directory of Russian entities at the Chamber in Prague. 
Prospective Czech suppliers to the Russian market can order a 
tailor-made service at the Chamber, for instance, research into 
the marketing conditions for their product. This research can 
by a simple report or a profound analysis. Since the Chambers 
has its own contacts and Russian experts participate in drafting 
the analyses, the results can really be considered to be real 
information, and not imagination. As a service to its members 
(and for a fee to nonmembers) the Chamber regularly publishes 
commercial information, for instance, Russian laws, lists of 
enterprises, privatization rules, instructions for establishing 
joint ventures in Russia, etc., etc. The Chamber is capable of 
securing the participation of Czech entities in Russian 
expositions, and some expositions were even organized by the 
Chamber (in Almaaty in April this year, and in Moscow in June). 
<H5>  The Road for a Small Exporter: An Association </H5>
  The Association for the Development of Trade with the East 
(APROV) was established at the beginning of the year as an 
interest group involving Czech firms that wanted to assert 
themselves (not only) on the Russian market. President of the 
Association Jiri Sedlmajer (and not only he) says that small 
manufactures cannot assert themselves on the Russian market 
since they do not have funds to at least have their own man in 
Moscow. He believes (again, he is not alone) that the physical 
presence is the alpha and omega of the success. APROV has the 
ambition to gradually establish offices not only in Moscow, but 
in other interesting places, too. Only several dozens firms, 
whose turnover runs from one to several million korunas, have 
become members of the association so far. Most of them are from 
the industrial and agricultural complex. According to the 
Association's idea, their members can conduct trade not only in 
the classical way--that is, for money--but partially also as 
barter trade. The Association has a list of Czech firms that 
are interested in certain Russian goods (wood, plastic 
materials, fertilizers, etc.). The management of the 
Association is prepared to provide information to their members 
(for a fee to nonmembers) about the situation in Russia. 
  APROV is not the only organization of this type. Today, 
there are more of them and all are counting on the common 
denominator: One's own man on Russian territory, information 
from the source, and willingness to conclude barter deals. 

<H5>    The Success of the Great Ones: Inekon </H5>
  Regarding the number of employees, Inekon Ltd. is a small 
firm, but its turnover ranks it in a different category. About 
30 people made 1.7 billion [currency not specified] last year, 
and the company foresees 2 billion this year. The company was 
established in 1990, and made a profit in the trade in chemical 
products. Later, they returned to trading in products with which 
the founders have experience: engineering products. Director 
Josef Husek admits that even their experience was not good 
enough to prevent the company "falling for" the so-called spisky 
[Russian word for lists] that were drafted by the then Soviet 
Union and the Czechoslovak Foreign Trade Ministry. In good 
faith, believing that these lists were a binding document, 
Inekon exported 200 CKD-made [Ceskomoravska Kolben Danek-made] 
locomotives to the Soviet Union. Only half of them have been 
paid for, the rest represents their dollar-denominated claim in 
Russia. Josef Husek affirms that the company is delivering 
goods to Russia and other former countries of the Soviet Union 
only against cash payments (in convertible currencies), and even 
against advance cash payments. According to Husek, Western 
European, U.S., and Japanese firms set the same conditions. The 
Inekon company is trading on its own account. It exports 
locomotives, street cars, and trolleybuses. According to the 
company, enterprises in Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, or 
Kazakhstan are willing to pay, but the company is afraid that 
Czech suppliers may not be able to manufacture and deliver the 
required products on time. Inekon has certain reservations 
about the Association of Czech Exporters and the assistance 
provided by chambers [of commerce]. 
<H5>  A View From the Other Side </H5>
  Alexander Safonov, chief of the Economic Department at the 
Trade Mission of the Russian Federation, explains in good Czech 
that the Czech-Russian trade has gotten over the "shocks" 
already. In 1991, this trade survived the transition to 
convertible currencies, in 1992, the breakup of the Soviet 
Union, and in 1993, the establishment of the Czech Republic. 
Nevertheless, Safonov stresses that the Russian market is far 
from "easy," since the Russian industrial lobby is fighting for 
the protection of the Russian market against "foreign 
intruders." According to Safonov, Russian foreign trade is 
liberal, and its legal and legislative basis is basically a 
standard one. Nevertheless, while the list of products for 
which import licenses are required is being reduced, the control 
of the export of strategic materials is being intensified, and 
so is the control of the quality of imported goods. Licenses 
for the export of strategic materials are issued only within the 
quotas fixed by the state (crude oil, gas, electricity, 
nonferrous metals, corn, certain fish products, uncut diamonds, 
etc.). By a decree of the Russian president last year, Russian 
enterprises that are conducting trade with former COMECON [CEMA] 
countries have been exempted from the obligation to sell half of 
their foreign currency income to the state. However, this 
applies only to the trade that is conducted in national 
currencies, which, on the other hand, is not the case when 
strategic materials are exported from Russia. Safonov believes 
that the "trend to use national currencies in mutual trade 
between the Russian Federation and the Czech Republic is a sound 
trend, the development of which can contribute to the smoothness 
of accounting." The Russian representative draws the attention 
of the Czech manufacturers to the fact that the Czech products 
will have to compete with Asian and Western products on the 
Russian markets. The export of these products is often 
subsidized. According to him, Asian and Western firms deliver 
goods while using state-subsidized credits, and enjoy 
state-provided support when establishing and operating 
information services, etc. 
<H5>  The Czech Government Is Also Doing Its Best </H5>
  Jan Hronik, chief of the department in charge of countries 
with transition economies at the Ministry of Industry and Trade, 
points to the fact that we have succeeded in stopping the 
decline in Czech exports into the countries of the former USSR, 
while imports have declined, which means that the trade balance 
has begun to improve. Last year's deficit declined by one third 
compared with 1992. Hronik is saying that after the Czech 
Republic was established, it was necessary to start negotiations 
on drafting and signing standard legal documents, and, today, 
they have been signed with Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, 
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and other countries of the former USSR. 
Today, the Ministry of Finance, in cooperation with the 
Ministry of Industry and Trade, is drafting additional important 
documents regarding the support for and the mutual protection of 
investments, and on preventing double taxation. The Czech and 
Russian sides have agreed on the establishment of the 
Czech-Russian Intergovernmental Commission for solving the most 
important and topical problems. The Czech claims certainly are 
one of those problems. Ivan Kocarnik chairs the Czech part of 
the Commission. 
  At present, a protocol on mutual deliveries of goods 
between the Czech Republic and the Russian Federation is being 
drafted for 1994. A list of products in high demand will 
certainly be attached as a supplement to this protocol. 
Evidently, after the experience of 1991, no one in the Czech 
Republic will consider these lists to be a guarantee for 
exports--or payments. 
<H5>  What About the Future? </H5>
  Everyone with whom we have spoken--in the sphere of trade 
and 
in the state administration--agrees that Russia and the 
countries of the former Soviet Union are, prospectively, a very 
important market. To make these prospects materialize in the 
nearest future, exporters must have the knowledge of the place, 
the people, and the milieu. They must have their own man in 
Russia. They must verify that their partner is solvent--at 
least in rubles, since the Russian internal convertibility will 
secure them access to the freely convertible currencies. Since 
the Russian manufacturers are pushing for the protection of 
their markets, it seems that the transfer of production into 
Russia--that is, establishing joint ventures--could become a 
partial solution. The infamous lack of technological discipline 
is not necessarily an evil. When stricter control is applied, 
discipline can be improved. Moreover, the sharp increase in 
transport tariffs in Russia, which makes Czech imports logically 
more expensive, would not play an important role if the 
production was launched on the market there. 
  Some experts believe that joint ventures would contribute to 
the unfreezing of Czech claims. However, the manufacturing and 
commercial circles are pointing to the fact that the government 
is expected to do something about it. The government should try 
to find a global solution for dealing with the Russian side (a 
task for the Intergovernmental Commission?). The Czech 
Government is expected to persuade the Russian side to be more 
willing to meet us halfway and to waive the requirement that the 
exporters to the Czech Republic must "offer" half of their 
foreign currency income to the Russian state coffers. This 
requirement is hampering the development of barter deals, 
despite the fact that Russia does have certain regards for the 
suppliers from the former CEMA countries. When asked whether the 
government should exert pressure on the Russian Government, 
tradesmen speak about a trade-off. Of course, the Czech 
exporters to Russia would be happy if a law existed on support 
to exports that would provide them with easy access to cheaper 
and long-term credits. They have come to terms with the fact 
that guarantees are rare. The largest companies, however, want 
to feel the "state" presence from time to time. The minister's 
visit to these territories is also an important proexport 
measure, despite the fact that he only shook hands and smiled at 
everyone.

<F P=106> ["Interview granted by President Ion Iliescu for the </F>
magazine FORUM published under the aegis of the Council of 
Europe"; place and date not given: "Back to Our Natural 
Political Habitat"] 
  [Text] [FORUM] Mr. President, what does Romania's 
admission to the Council of Europe represent? 
  [Iliescu] Romania's integration in European democratic 
structures was a priority objective of our foreign policy, which 
was actually affirmed right at the beginning of the December 
1989 revolution. This is in keeping with our fundamental 
interests, a fact that has been attested to by the interest 
shown by the entire Romanian political spectrum in our country's 
admission to the Council of Europe. 
  From an historical point of view, this event marks Romania's 
ultimate release from the ideological prison, which placed it in 
"Eastern Europe," and its natural reintegration in the area of 
European civilization and political beliefs to which it always 
used to belong. 
  The political changes that have occurred in Romania since 
1989 -- complex and difficult changes that, from many points of 
view, were more radical than in the other Central and East 
European countries, ranging from the adoption of the new 
Constitution to the operation of the new institutional system of 
our political, economic, and social activity -- have been 
recognized as contributing directly to the general process of 
change in Europe, in full accordance with the fundamental 
democratic norms and beliefs that have been preserved and 
promoted by this institution -- the Council of Europe -- that is 
a symbol of the renewal of the old continent . 
  [FORUM] As a full member of the Council of Europe, what are 
your priorities within this organization? 
  [Iliescu] Our priorities are the priorities of Europe. The 
creation of a new system of relations on the continent, both 
political and economic, and removing the consequences of past 
barriers do not take place on their own. There is, however, a 
tendency to preserve former gaps and to create new barriers to 
European reintegration. 
  The Council of Europe is the institution that is able to 
play 
an essential role in overcoming outdated mentalities and 
promoting fundamental human values that, at this point, are more 
necessary than ever before. 
  It can make a decisive contribution toward identifying new 
ways and means of communication and cooperation. 
  It can create a new basis for broaching our common problems, 
ranging from economic ones to those concerning our continent's 
security, which has deteriorated so much due to the persistence 
of open armed conflicts and the intensification of ethnic or 
religious conflicts. The reestablishment of the unity of 
civilization and culture in Europe, where diversity constituted 
a source of progress and cultural enrichment for all countries, 
constitutes, probably, our most important common objective. The 
Council of Europe is the institution that is best suited to 
promote its implementation. 
  [FORUM] On joining the Council, you promised to ratify the 
European Convention on Human Rights; these rights were seriously 
violated in your country before 1989. What is the situation 
regarding their reestablishment? 
  [Iliescu] Reestablishing fundamental human rights and 
freedoms in Romania represents and has always represented -- 
right from the beginning of the December 1989 revolution -- a 
major objective of the process of social change that is under 
way. The drafting and approval by Parliament, and later by 
means of a referendum, of the new Constitution marked a decisive 
stage in implementing this objective. The Constitution does not 
only express fundamental rights and freedoms directly, but it 
also stipulates, in an equal way, the prevalence of 
international laws in this area. 
  [FORUM] International public opinion is concerned about the 
minorities in Romania -- Hungarians, of course, but also others, 
for example, the Gypsies. What policy will be practiced to 
eliminate this concern? In what way may the Council of Europe 
be of help in this respect? 
  [Iliescu] We intend to promote the policy of truth. As I 
have said before, Romania has no reason to develop complexes on 
account of its policy toward ethnic minorities. 
  Romania's laws and practice exceed by far the generally 
accepted standards in this respect; there are not many European 
states where minorities enjoy the same rights that they enjoy in 
Romania, especially the Hungarian minority: Representation in 
Parliament, local councils, education, cultural establishments, 
publications in their mother tongue, and so forth. 
Unfortunately, however, this reality was often distorted to 
such an extent as to cause the international public concern to 
which you are referring. 
  I regret that these false criteria are coming especially 
from 
countries that do not guarantee any rights to the ethnic 
minorities with whom they coexist, including Romanian ethnics. 
  We hope that our country's admission to the Council of 
Europe will enable us to step out of the shadow of neglect by 
the media into which we were pushed by both domestic and foreign 
forces hostile to truth and democracy. 
  We hope that the traditional Romanian tolerance that has 
developed and which today is characterized by the absence of any 
ethnic discrimination in our society may be verified and made 
known to European public opinion. 
  Minorities in Romania are suffering because of economic 
difficulties, the strategic errors made by the recently removed 
totalitarian regime, the difficulties generated by the 
transition to a market economy, the effects of the observation 
of the embargo against former Yugoslavia and Iraq, and the world 
recession. They are suffering in the same way as most Romanians 
are suffering. 
  This is why I think that the "concern" voiced by public 
opinion for the fate of minorities in Romania has to be 
channeled toward seeking ways and means to ensure more 
appropriate economic cooperation -- including a decrease in 
protectionism -- , investments, and the transfer of managerial 
and technological know- how so as to be able to capitalize fully 
on Romania's tremendous human and natural potential. 
  [FORUM] Almost four years ago, the Council of Europe 
launched assistance programs for the democratization of Central 
and Eastern European countries. What do you think of these 
programs and what are your concrete expectations for Romania? 
  [Iliescu] The answer to this question is the same as that 
given to the previous question. Foreign assistance cannot be 
ignored, but our own efforts and determination have essentially 
helped Romania pass through the main stages -- from the most 
despondent dictatorship to a European type of democratization -- 
in a relatively short period of time. From the institutional 
point of view, the democratization process is, in general terms, 
finished, while, in terms of mentality, development follows the 
nature of things, that is to say, more slowly. All experts view 
our Constitution as being very modern and democratic. We have 
pluralism, separation of state powers, and freedom of opinion, 
speech, press, and association and, in the past three years, we 
have had four electoral consultations with the people (after the 
general elections, local elections and a referendum on the 
Constitution) which were recognized as being free and correct 
not only according to the law but also in practice; we have all 
the elements needed to guarantee democratic political activity. 
At this point, there is no economic threat. However, if the 
current economic recovery were to be halted, any development 
would be possible, despite the Romanian people's craving for 
democracy for the sake of which they braved the bullets of the 
dictatorship in December 1989. 
  One should not forget that Hitler installed totalitarianism 
in Germany in a politically democratic society that was facing, 
however, economic collapse. Therefore, the main way in which 
Europe can assist democracy in Romania is -- I am going to say 
this although I risk repeating myself -- through open economic 
cooperation, opening markets for Romanian trade, and through 
investments and transfer of managerial and technological 
know-how. 
  [FORUM] After Bulgaria, your country is the second country 
within the Council of Europe with a common border with the new 
Yugoslav Federation against which the international community 
has imposed restrictions. This physical contact offers you the 
privileged position of an observer. How do you assess the 
development of the current situation? 
  [Iliescu] Our relations with the Yugoslav Federation, with 
the countries within former Yugoslavia, are, in actual fact, 
special. Romania is a country that, throughout history, has not 
had any disputes or confrontations with any of those countries. 
We will continue to believe, as we have always affirmed, that, 
in order to avoid an escalation of bloody violence, the 
regulation of the situation in this area -- the current 
situation in the Yugoslav Federation can be assessed only by 
bearing in mind all the problems created by the dismemberment of 
former Yugoslavia -- can be achieved only through political will 
and dialogue. This should be the only direction in which events 
should develop: A peaceful solution. 
  Whether this comes sooner or later, involving costs and 
human 
sacrifices, as well as lower or higher economic losses, depends, 
first and foremost, on the wisdom of the sides involved in the 
conflict, but also on the capability and concern of other forces 
that are able to arouse the interest of the world community in 
order to eliminate this dangerous source of conflict in the 
heart of Europe. We are certainly interested in a rapid 
solution to the differences and in the removal of the embargo 
that has had an enormous effect upon our economy from every 
point of view.

<F P=106> [Statement adopted at the meeting of the Central Executive </F>
Bureau of the Social Democracy Party of Romania in Bucharest on 
22 February; published by ROMANIA LIBERA under the headline: 
"Divorce, For Reasons of Love"] 
  [Text] The Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] took 
note of the open letter that the nine members of the Greater 
Romania Party [PRM] leadership addressed to President Ion 
Iliescu. This letter directly affects our relations with the 
PRM, which has thus announced the electorate that it "suspends 
all negotiations begun with the PDSR regarding a participation 
in the government." 
  In these circumstances, it is necessary to explain our 
party's position on the issues raised by that letter, which 
motivated the respective decision of the PRM leadership. 
<H5>  With Electoral Demagoguery, Forward! </H5>
  1. The letter of the nine members of the PRM leadership 
depicts the current Romanian society in a way that we cannot 
agree with. Their description of the country's situation, in 
apocalyptic terms, is not based on a serious analysis of the 
circumstances. We would have expected the leadership of a 
parliamentary party to overcome the stage of electoral 
demagoguery and make a profound analysis of the processes and 
trends in Romanian society. 
  The situation is indeed difficult, but a lucid examination 
should primarily emphasize the causes of this situation. After 
the 1989 revolution, Romania has lost half of its foreign 
markets and the mechanisms of the centralized economy were 
eliminated without us having developed the specific mechanisms 
of the market economy to replace them. All this has caused 
Romanian industry to operate at half of its capacity. 
  To all this, one should add the Gulf crisis, which caused 
Romania losses amounting to almost $3 billion, and the embargo 
imposed against Yugoslavia, which cost us another $7 billion in 
direct and indirect losses. 
  Romania has been and is still being faced with a number of 
very serious crises. Their cumulative effect is quite hard to 
endure and it has generated social discrepancies, various cases 
of corruption, and a state of discontent among the people, who 
must cope with many hardships. 
  However, one cannot solve these problems through laments and 
demagogic and populist formulas. You need an authentic will if 
you want to accomplish that. The real problems of the economy 
must be solved by taking into consideration the context of the 
real world, the world in which we live and from which we cannot 
isolate ourselves, by replacing it with an utopian world or by 
turning back to the past. 
<H5>  From "Proven Criminals" to the "Future Convicts" </H5>
  2. The entire language used in the letter is vulgar and 
unworthy of the leadership of a parliamentary party. It abounds 
in totally unfounded accusations and personal attacks, which 
again prove that the nine signatories of the letter consider 
themselves to be above the law. They want to supplant our legal 
bodies -- which are the only ones in a position to decide who 
are "proven criminals" and "future convicts" -- on the basis of 
arguments contained in some anonymous letters sent to the 
editorial staff of the ROMANIA MARE and POLITICA magazines by 
"several earnest Romanian women with the fear of God in their 
souls," by "a group of generals," or others. 
  The rule-of-law state relies on arguments, proofs, and the 
observance of rights and laws, primarily the observance of the 
basic principles of the presumption of innocence until proven 
otherwise. The rule-of-law state does not rely on letters 
received by the editorial staff, on their number, on the 
"people's verdict," or on the conviction of some party leaders 
that they represent the law. We cannot accept the "judicial 
messianism" that the nine members of the PRM leadership arrogate 
to themselves. They may display its exclusively before their 
supporters, at their party meetings; however, in their capacity 
as parliamentarians, they must subordinate themselves to the 
law, as far as their actions and manners are concerned. 
  We believe that, before pronouncing on the major problems of 
the country, the nine members of the PRM leadership should begin 
by apologizing to those whom they have slanderously attacked in 
their letter, primarily the country's president. 
<H5>  Slightly More Than 3 Percent </H5>
  3. In connection with all this, we would like to state our 
position vis-a-vis the claim of the PRM leadership that it 
speaks on behalf of the people or of "the Romanians" and that it 
"echoes the people's discontent." We believe that these habits, 
which were acquired during the reign of the sole party, cannot 
be imposed on us as a norm of behavior and a criterion of 
political superiority; they might belong to a party that, 
although it claims to represent "the Romanians," have barely 
exceeded the 3 percent threshold required for being represented 
in Parliament. 
  In a pluralistic democracy, the PRM leadership only has the 
right to talk on behalf of the "25,000 card-carrying members." 
Whose capacity to mobilize correctly reflects the people's 
interests is periodically checked by elections. 
  4. As a matter of fact, the entire letter signed by the 
nine members of the PRM Steering Committee proves that it is 
motivated by electoral campaign considerations, rather than the 
desire -- if any at all -- to find solutions and answers to the 
real problems facing Romanian society today. The reference to 
early elections that can be found at the end of the letter 
proves that the PRM leadership is not concerned with the 
consequences of political acts and of their own responsibility. 
The appeal, which is made in a purely electoral style, to "all 
Romanians who love their country" and whom the National Bloc is 
"awaiting with open arms," has nothing to do with tackling and 
solving the country's problems. 
<H5>  Patriotism as a Party Monopoly </H5>
  5. We consider that patriotism cannot be the monopoly of a 
political party, the PRM's appanage. Being a patriot does not 
mean isolating Romania from the modern world, but rather 
protecting its interests and sovereignty within the framework of 
the modern world. You do not accomplish this by going back to 
the communist system and rekindling Ceausescu's image, but by 
realizing that our country's evolution depends on European 
developments, which the PRM seems to ignore. Our political 
intelligence and the principles and values we believe in should 
not lead us to making enemies left and right -- both inside the 
country and abroad -- through demagogic, populist, xenophobic, 
or antisemitic speeches. 
  These manifestations, which are unanimously condemned, 
project an unfavorable image for Romania abroad and cause us 
great difficulties in connecting our country to the modern world. 
  6. It is true that we have reached a pretty tense situation 
in the country's political life. A good part of these political 
tensions, which affect the government's action capability, were 
artificially created, on the one hand by the ambitions of 
certain politicians who want to change the composition of the 
government at all costs and, on the other hand, by an erroneous 
understanding of the role of the opposition in a pluralist 
democratic system. 
  All these problems can be resolved through negotiations 
among 
the political parties. Therefore, the PDSR welcomed the 
Romanian president's initiative on the conclusion of a political 
pact and pledged to achieve it. 
  From the letter of the PRM Steering Committee, we note that 
the differences between our parties on the ways and means to 
overcome these tensions are profound and quite susceptible to 
lead to a real political crisis, whose consequences -- imputable 
to the PRM leadership alone -- the PDSR is ready to face. 
<H5>  Inciting to Violence </H5>
  7. Resorting to totally groundless propagandistic cliches 
("imported reform") and accusing the government of things that 
it has not done, and which actually contradict our party's 
principled positions ("shock therapy"), the PRM is projecting a 
true scenario of incitation to violence and justification of 
violence. The exclusively negative description of the country's 
situation should serve the goal of presenting the PRM leadership 
members as "justice seekers," the only one capable of saving the 
people from being "robbed" by the "alliance" between the power 
and the opposition. 
  At the same time, this true denigration of the country seems 
to be a justification of violence. The message of the PRM 
leadership's letter is that, if there is misery, hunger, 
epidemics, and crime, the only solution to all this is violence 
-- the violence of the workers from the Grivita Workshops and a 
"possible outbreak of popular despair," which, in the view of 
the PRM leadership, "would be more devastating than the December 
1989 revolution." 
  The entire text of the PRM leadership's letter contains no 
concrete solution. The proposed political philosophy seems to 
be the threat that "if we come to power, within 24 hours we will 
do away with the robbery, chaos, and the profanation of the 
Romanians in their own home." 
<H5>  A Simplistic Way of Thinking </H5>
  Beyond the recollection of other times and political forces, 
when some "24 hour" solutions were tried out, this passage 
clearly proves a simplistic way of thinking, for which the 
entire process of institutional restructuring is nothing but 
"chaos," while the economic reform and the privatization process 
are nothing but "robbery." 
  We have all due respect for an economist from Diaspora, such 
as Professor Anghel Rugina. However, we are not convinced -- as 
the nine members of the PRM leadership seem to be -- that "this 
idealist," who, out of objective reasons, is not familiar with 
the specific problems of the Romanian economy, would have a plan 
that can "avoid all the errors committed in the other Eastern 
countries." We are open to his ideas, but we consider it an 
unacceptable insult to accuse our government, the Romanian 
economists engaged in working out and implementing the reform, 
and those who are planning the integration of the Romanian 
economy into the European and world economy of being "doubtful 
experts only intent on lining their own pockets." 
  8. In these circumstances, the PDSR can only take note of 
the decision to suspend the talks that the PRM leadership has 
adopted. The responsibility for this act and its implications 
fully devolves on the nine members of the PRM Steering 
Committee. As a matter of fact, given the "platform" emphasized 
in that letter of the PRM leadership, it is hardly likely that 
we can still find some elements of dialogue. 
  For us, it will be very difficult in the future to 
differentiate between the pamphlet writer Corneliu Vadim Tudor 
and the party leader Corneliu Vadim Tudor, head of the PRM. At 
the same time, we believe that the PRM members will show 
understanding for our position. As far as our relationship with 
the PRM deputies and senators is concerned, we have often had 
constructive, joint or closely similar positions on certain 
draft bills. However, we assure them and the PRM rank-and-file 
members that we are still open to a dialogue with them, provided 
that party leaders show responsibility, that they are prepared 
to adopt reasonable positions, and that they are truly concerned 
with the real problems the country is facing in this period of 
transition. 
  This statement was adopted at the enlarged meeting of the 
Central Executive Bureau, with the participation of the PDSR 
parliamentary groups, on 22 February 1994.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oliviu Gherman, president of the Social </F>
Democracy Party of Romania, by Mihai Fabian; place and date not 
given: "We Envisaged a Long-Term Government Formula"] 
  [Text] [Fabian] Mr. President, will we or will we not 
have a new government by 1 March? If yes, what will be its 
"color"? 
  [Gherman] Prime Minister Vacaroiu is the most authorized 
person to answer this question. We voted confidence in Prime 
Minister Vacaroiu and suggested that he should make certain 
changes to the current government formula. Therefore, we will 
not have a new government, but it is very likely that we will 
have a government reshuffle by 1 March 1994. 
  [Fabian] It is said that this government will be a coalition 
between the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] and PUNR 
[Romanian National Unity Party]. 
  [Gherman] We would be slightly anticipating things if we 
were to make such an affirmation. Even from the protocol 
concluded with PUNR, it has resulted that it is not strictly 
necessary to have a government that includes members of 
political formations but members recommended by certain 
political formations. Nevertheless, we agreed that among the 
recommended persons, there should be a competition of 
professionalism. Therefore, if PUNR recommends a person who 
exceptionally fulfills all the conditions in those areas that we 
believe the government's activity was less than efficient, then 
we will accept that person. If you carefully read the protocol 
with PUNR, you will see that the fundamental criteria is 
professionalism. Therefore, it is not excluded that 
modifications might be made to the current structure of the 
government and it is not excluded that people recommended by 
PUNR might be included in the government. Regarding the 
respective person's affiliation to a party, the problem is a 
little more complex because this issue is not a clause 
specifically stipulated neither in the protocol nor in our 
understandings. 
  [Fabian] Thus, people recommended by PUNR might become 
government members. Could it happen that none of the new 
members would belong to PUNR? 
  [Gherman] This has not been requested in the protocol. 
  [Fabian] Has PUNR not insisted on this issue? 
  [Gherman] I cannot disclose any more information in this 
discussion. Certainly, we thought about the variation that the 
recommended people should be PUNR members, but, precisely in 
order to give a broader scope to proposals, we agreed that the 
respective people should be recommended by PUNR. 
  [Fabian] Were there ministries about which more heated 
discussions were held, in the sense that the PDSR would have 
liked to maintain control over those sectors that are believed 
to be key sectors? Does PUNR in turn wish to obtain certain 
ministries? 
  [Gherman] The biggest mistake that a politician could make 
would be to publicly reveal intentions referring to certain 
proposed moves. Everyone is curious. Everyone would like to 
know whether the changes we are going to make will affect 
education, culture, or finance. However, such a thing is 
announced the moment the change has been carried out. There is 
no country in the world where various aspects of a business, 
banking operations, or issues connected with the government are 
announced to the public before the changes have been made. 
Thus, no matter how much sympathy I would feel toward your 
newspaper and you personally, and even if I knew exactly what 
changes are going to be made, it would be a real mistake to 
disclose them before the change itself has been carried out. 
  [Fabian] A new formula for a government reshuffle has been 
negotiated. Has the durability of the new government formula 
been discussed, or has it been viewed as a team that should 
ensure the process of transition until appropriate conditions 
are created for more fundamental, ample, and even more open 
discussions with the opposition? 
  [Gherman] We have not negotiated a stage, while keeping the 
next one in mind. We discussed these aspects with the parties 
that are included in the government in order to resolve the 
problem of governing. If the respective solutions prove to be 
very efficient, it means that we have no reason to think about 
them as short-term solutions. Thus, we have not established a 
certain trial period or a limited period of time for this 
solution. On the contrary, we wanted it to be a long-term 
solution. Thus, this is not a transition government, a 
government that should ensure that we cross the bridge. It is a 
government that we envisaged as a long-term one. 
  [Fabian] When the new government is established, it has to 
do its job. It needs parliamentary support. In the light of 
the latest stand taken by the PRM [Greater Romania Party] and 
the PSM [Socialist Party of Labor], it is difficult to believe 
that the PDSR will continue to enjoy the necessary parliamentary 
support. Some percents are missing. Have you thought about 
getting them from somewhere else? 
  [Gherman] Your hypothesis is erroneous. Namely, I do not 
believe in nor do I foresee any modifications in the option of 
the PRM and the PSM. I do not believe they will join the 
opposition to form a parliamentary opposition -- at least that 
is how I see things, even if in both cases negotiations on a new 
government formula have been suspended. 
  [Fabian] The conditions under which the government continues 
its activity are unusual. There is talk about accepting an 
austerity program. What are the measures that the PDSR is 
proposing to take in order to attenuate as much as possible the 
deterioration of its prestige? 
  [Gherman] In our government program, we propose to reduce 
the effects of this austerity program to a minimum. We are 
certain that by the end of 1994, the country's economic 
situation will have improved considerably, which will implicitly 
lead to an improvement of people's living standard. 
  [Fabian] During your discussions, have you thought of the 
possibility that the new government team might be able to settle 
the conflict with the trade unions and ensure credibility abroad? 
  [Gherman] We have constantly maintained cooperative 
relations with all the trade union confederations. First of 
all, we have taken note of all viewpoints regarding the 
credibility of a government reshuffled in accordance with the 
views expressed by those trade union confederations. There has 
been a constant, substantial exchange of information, opinions, 
suggestions, and even certain variations that were presented by 
both partners. 
  As far as credibility abroad is concerned, I have learned a 
very tough lesson -- namely that credibility abroad can only be 
achieved through credibility at home. If we work better and 
more efficiently, we will achieve better economic results and, 
thus, eliminate embarrassing elements from our relations with 
other countries. Our credibility will be ensured. Here is an 
example: If we eliminate all acts of chauvinism and 
anti-Semitism, and condemn such attitudes, if we try to maintain 
a temperate and democratic atmosphere in our country, and, at 
the same time, prove the efficiency of our government, then our 
credibility is ensured. We will have to overcome a superficial 
aspect of identifying certain parties with certain people. If 
you study the documents that have been signed by us, including 
the protocol with PUNR, you will realize that these are in 
complete and total agreement with the requirements of the 
Council of Europe, as well as the European Community. 
Therefore, one can take substantial steps forward and they will 
certainly be noticed by our foreign partners.

  [Excerpts] The Hungarian prime minister has visited two 
European capitals within two weeks. He made a statement to our 
"Newsreel" program after his return. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] You have now 
visited Paris and Bonn within a week. Does it mean that these 
two countries are the most important European countries for 
Hungary right now? 
  [Boross] Well, they are two determining powers, members of 
an 
alliance, and are very important for Hungary. I do not think it 
is a coincidence that I visited these two capitals. Germany 
represents a decisive force within the EU [European Union], and 
the fact that it has undertaken to support us in this way means 
that our application [for full EU membership] will be received 
favorably. 
  [Correspondent] [passage omitted] Chancellor Kohl referred 
to 
the intention to put on the EU agenda the ways in which new 
members may be admitted; in other words they want to hold 
negotiations in this respect. How do they see the terms? 
  [Boross] Well, a longer period of preparation and 
negotiation 
faces us, because the Hungarian economy must become suitable for 
admission into the EU. [passage omitted] It must be added that 
there is extraordinarily great interest toward Hungary. As a 
matter of fact, I heard praise about the Hungarian economy's 
ability to absorb capital. [end recording]

  [Text] [Announcer] The Fidesz [Federation of Young 
Democrats] and the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats] are only 
willing to continue talks about the media bill if the government 
guarantees the independence of television and radio for the 
elections. Kata Peli Nagy reports on the joint declaration by 
the two parties. 
  [Nagy] The Fidesz and SZDSZ are ready to continue 
negotiations about the media law, but they do not want to 
sacrifice principles serving the impartiality of the media. So 
far, the two parties have been participating in the coordination 
of the media bill on two conditions: One, the government is to 
remedy the unfortunate situation reigning in the public media 
immediately and two: The future media law is to guarantee the 
impartiality of public service television in order that neither 
the present, nor any future government should be able to use it 
for party political purposes. 
  However, the two parties' impressions regarding the talks 
are 
that the government is reluctant to be represented at the 
coordination, and Prime Minister Peter Boross has refused talks 
about the media situation. Here is Gabor Kuncze, leader of the 
SZDSZ election list: 
  [Begin Kuncze recording] Mindful of the fact that only the 
government has any opportunity to intervene in the extremely bad 
situation that has evolved, we think that this is an indication 
that the present situation in the Hungarian television and radio 
suits the government only too well. It intends to maintain the 
situation until the elections, and it does not want to negotiate 
with the opposition about these issues. Therefore, if the 
necessary measures are not carried out, the Fidesz and the SZDSZ 
will leave the negotiating table. It is the government's turn to 
make a move. [end recording] 
  [Nagy] The two parties evaluated the internal situation that 
has developed in the television and the radio as follows, I 
quote: MTV continuously violates the ethical code of election, 
it openly incites and slanders in several of its programs. MTV 
openly belongs to the government and in the radio an open 
political showdown, disguised as professional reorganization, is 
being prepared.

<F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Bekesi, former finance minister and </F>
economic expert for the Hungarian Socialist Party, by Lorinc 
Szendrei; place and date not given: "We Are Heading for 
Restructuring, Not Restoration"] 
  [Text] The socialists are steadily moving upwards on the 
popularity lists of various opinion polls. How different is the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] from the former state party? 
Where can we place the MSZP on the list of left-wing formations 
in Europe? Will the MSZP start restructuring or restoring 
things if they get into power? We asked former finance minister 
and current MSZP politician Laszlo Bekesi, whose name is also 
mentioned as a possible candidate for the position of prime 
minister. 
  [Szendrei] We cannot find a single party today that does not 
have some kind of problems or reservations regarding the 
socialists, while a considerable part of political forecasts 
mention the MSZP as a potentional governing factor. You are 
being measured, and possible coalition partners do not seem to 
hurry to contact you. From the other side, you receive the label 
of being the successor to the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party 
[MSZMP]. Threatening tones can also be heard, claiming that the 
communists will come back with you. Preparing for its last 
congress before the elections, where does the MSZP stand in the 
left-wing arena used in the Western- European terminology? 
  [Bekesi] First of all about "measuring." The tough 
quarantine after the elections held in 1990 is the consequence 
of the demarcations of various intensities and intentions. Most 
parties won over a considerable number of voters through a tough 
anti- Bolshevik and anti-leftist propaganda. This worked 
perfectly in 1990. Of course, in that cast, the MSZP was the 
undesirable and improper successor party. Most parties think 
that this anti- communism might also bring votes this year. The 
third cause can be the essential one: It has become clear that, 
with very tough and detailed work, the quarantined MSZP 
preserved its calm and strengthened the professional image that 
emerged as a nostalgia for the Nemeth cabinet. This feeling is 
so strong today that all the political parties running in the 
elections regard the MSZP as their biggest rival. 
  [Szendrei] Do you think that only fear of a socialist 
victory and the loss of power dominates the evaluation of the 
MSZP? 
  [Bekesi] The government coalition displays an aversion to us 
and accuses us of everything because it clearly realized that a 
considerable part of our society finds the leading energies in 
the MSZP. It is, therefore, clear to the coalition parties that 
the MSZP represents the biggest danger against their desire to 
hold on to power. Therefore, nothing is too costly for them, 
and they make use of everything, including slander, lies, and 
the misinterpretation of achievements. 
<H5>  Without Sacred Dogmas </H5>
  [Szendrei] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] does not 
get closer to you either; on the contrary: Viktor Orban sent 
you a message in the press according to which the MSZP is facing 
34 years of opposition. 
  [Bekesi] The liberals, who generally follow the same goals 
as we do, see us as a rival whose success at the elections would 
lead to its predominance in a potential coalition. 
  [Szendrei] Would you accept this coalition? 
  [Bekesi] Why would we discard it? Let us stay with the idea 
that the liberals fear that we, the socialists, could gain the 
upper hand in the government. However, a social-liberal 
coalition is the real solution in Hungary. They can only 
envisage such a coalition if the MSZP can only get a subordinate 
role. This is their interest. 
  [Szendrei] After all, no matter how we look at it, the MSZP 
suffered a defeat four years ago. The hope for a comeback is 
only natural. 
  [Bekesi] There are no revanchist emotions or hopes involved 
here. The accusation that we are a successor party preparing 
for the restoration of the old ways is totally unfounded. We 
are preparing for restructuring, and not for the restoration of 
the milder phase of the Kadar regime. 
  [Szendrei] Apart from rejecting the accusations, how else 
can the MSZP get rid of the labels of the past? 
  [Bekesi] Of course, we know that rejecting accusations is 
not enough. It also transpires from our program that the MSZP 
is a pragmatic party definitely in favor of modernization, a 
party that does not stand on ideological bases, and a party that 
offers recipes for solving the current Hungarian social and 
economic problems. In addition, to the extent our economic 
scope allows it, we are also trying to represent classic 
left-wing values, like solidarity, the reduction of inequalities 
of chances, and help for fallen strata. 
  [Szendrei] These words coming from socialists make us recall 
the empty dogma of the past. 
  [Bekesi] I use the aforementioned expressions without fear, 
because we are definitely not thinking about these values on the 
level of dogma. The MSZP is not based on an ideology equivalent 
to the program of the German social democrats in the sixties. 
We are far rather following the Scharping-thinking 
characteristic of Western Europe at the end of the 20th century, 
a reasoning according to which nothing dogmatic is sacred. 
  [Szendrei] This is how communists became socialists? 
  [Bekesi] Neither here nor abroad can people claim that this 
is some kind of post-communist party with nostalgia, one 
strengthening and stressing the social democratic roots of the 
19th century. 
  [Szendrei] However, along with the increasing sympathy, many 
people fear that the reviving old political elite is preparing 
to violate the democracy emerging in the wake of the first free 
elections. 
  [Bekesi] Such opinions have indeed been voiced. Before 
listing our counter-arguments, I must firmly declare that there 
can be people among the politically-active public who reject the 
left and the MSZP from the outset, but they do not treat the 
fears and accusations seriously. Obviously, there is such a 
narrow circle of people, but these people can never be convinced 
with arguments. They voice their prejudices. 
  [Szendrei] Let us turn to the concrete counterarguments. 
  [Bekesi] In other words, we are the camouflaged communists, 
the deniers of pluralism and democracy, and even the pioneers of 
restoration? If the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] or other 
similar parties did nothing else but review the way they gained 
power and objectively analyze the period in which the Nemeth 
cabinet played the leading role, they could read from this the 
refutal of all the accusations. If they came to an objective 
conclusion, they would see that it was the post-communist Nemeth 
cabinet, and not they and the opposition at the time, that laid 
the basic pillars of democratic restructuring, including the 
legal, constitutional, and economic pillars. If they took a 
look at the system of institutions that emerged between 1988 and 
1990, institutions that shaped the bases of market economy, they 
would not continue to be suspicious regarding the sincerity of 
our decision to change the regime. We formed a two-tier banking 
system, reduced the budget, liberalized the imports, reduced the 
subsidies, reduced the political expenses, started the 
privatization, legislated laws regulating the enterprises, 
created the stock exchange, and so on.... I cannot list 
everything now. It is rather difficult to call all this an 
attempt of the post-communist Nemeth cabinet to preserve the 
existing and discredited socialism. One can calmly examine the 
past four years. It transpires from this that the legislative 
proposals of the MSZP, its parliamentary motions, its attitude, 
and now its program have always been directed at accelerating 
the process that has begun, rather than slowing or reversing it. 
If you find a single element in our program that refers to 
restoring old ways rather than accelerating the conclusion of 
the process of restructuring, then there is sense in arguing. 
Otherwise, all that remains is the labelling, something that is 
not taken seriously anywhere. 
  [Szendrei] In other words, this is the Socialist Party that 
wants to build capitalism and not socialism. Who will lead the 
party? The first three places on the party's list are occupied 
by former members of the MSZMP Central Committee. 
  [Bekesi] Our program is European. Two out of the three 
members of the national list were members of the aforementioned 
Nemeth government. Despite the accusations hurled against him, 
it would be difficult to say that Gyula Horn was not one of the 
driving forces of restructuring. Of course, there are also 
historical lies, but one can also find facts in history. A 
considerable stratum of young professionals has emerged in the 
party and its surrounding in the past three years, people who 
are indeed less known. But every opposition party received 
little coverage in the media and, thus, new faces find it more 
difficult to become known. 
<H5>  Mistaken Indicators </H5>
  [Szendrei] We have not yet spoken about the third member of 
the socialist troika, namely Sandor Nagy. A liberal economic 
policy with trade union support? Some Western-European 
governments have already failed in this. What will the trade 
union leaders do if the citizens demonstrate and strike against 
government measures? 
  [Bekesi] First of all, let us clarify the permanent 
attributes. The Hungarian economy is struggling with a deep 
crisis. We have no right or reason whatsoever to provide 
liberal, social, or conservative labels to the realistic 
economic policy capable of treating this economic situation. It 
is either a realistic policy spiced with any ideological 
elements, or it is unrealistic, and then we can call it by any 
name. According to my experience, there are not even slight 
differences between the party programs formulated after a 
serious analysis; at most, there are differences in phraseology 
and technical solutions. However, the guidelines are the same 
in the economic programs of the SZDSZ, the Federation of Young 
Democrats [Fidesz], or the MSZP alike. I see more decisive 
differences among the ideological parties. However, I must 
point out that the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is also 
beginning to become more realistic, precisely as a result of its 
government experience. Therefore, every labelling is mistaken. 
  [Szendrei] What about the cooperation with the trade unions? 
They are good in order to obtain power, but it is better for 
them to remain in the background in the governing activity. 
  [Bekesi] The MSZP has never claimed that the political 
agreement signed with the trade unions will guarantee a 
government free of arguments if the socialists participate in 
the coalition. No one believed even for a moment that the 
implementation of our economic policy program will not find some 
opposition points with the trade unions. There will be tough 
debates. The socialists do not want a trade union government. 
We cannot allow the trade unions to suppress a rational 
economic policy in the direction of distribution. However, we 
must add that the inevitable difficult steps will not succeed 
without a new social agreement. We, who regard the trade unions 
as our partners, have more chances than others. 
  [Szendrei] Hopefully Sandor Nagy will not become labor 
affairs minister.... 
  [Bekesi] You must be kidding. This is impossible. If any 
trade union leader accepts a position in Parliament or in the 
government, he will naturally resign from his trade union 
position. These two positions are incompatible. Besides, trade 
union leaders work in the parliaments of every European 
democracy. 
  [Szendrei] Thus, the employees' representatives can clearly 
see what they can count on. What can the employers hope for? 
Superficial readers of the program fear that the socialists want 
to introduce the property tax. 
  [Bekesi] Nothing like that. We are not talking about a 
property tax; we are talking about taxing the increase in 
property. This is something totally different. On the other 
hand, our program contains the elimination of the minimum tax, 
the restoration of tax benefits for investments, the elimination 
of tax on the interests of accounts that encourage savings, both 
forint and hard currency accounts. We are the only ones to say 
that investment benefits should also be extended to 
amortization. It is our goal to return the general turnover tax 
in order to increase housing construction. We say that the 
share of income and profit taxes should be reduced in the entire 
tax system. In other words, we would gradually reduce the 
company and personal income taxes. On the other hand, however, 
we would tax the final consumption and property increase. This 
means the inheritance tax on non-productive accumulated luxury 
property. We would not tax the active property. 
  [Szendrei] The elections are approaching, and then the 
formation of a government. The socialists met with Miklos 
Nemeth. The congress in not preparing to name the candidate for 
prime minister either. Among the rumors, it emerged that your 
party would accept Gabor Kuncze as prime minister. Your name 
has also been mentioned. Has the time come to clarify the issue? 
  [Bekesi] The essential thing is that the socialists are 
concentrating on solving the tasks in the election campaign, and 
not on distributing the future government positions and 
nominating the people. Only a coalition government can emerge 
in Hungary. We can envisage several variations. Therefore, we 
cannot name a candidate for the position of prime minister now. 
With this, we would considerably limit the chances of coalition 
talks. Miklos Nemeth has indeed been considered. He rejected 
the nomination because of his work in London, and thus we took 
this issue off the agenda. About Gabor Kuncze I can say that we 
indeed see the future in the form of a social-liberal coalition. 
Our programs also match. We say that we need a government that 
knows its job. Thus, we do not find it impossible to have the 
politician of a smaller party that wins the election become 
prime minister. Therefore, we will ask this congress to decide 
on this matter at a special congress after the elections. 
  [Szendrei] In such a moment, what would you say if they 
asked you to become prime minister? 
  [Bekesi] This is an academic question.... There could be 
such a constellation. 
  [Szendrei] Would you accept the position? 
  [Bekesi] A lot of conditions must be fulfilled in order to 
say yes, but such a possibility cannot be excluded.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chairman Peter Zwack and Deputy Chairman </F>
Lajos Kupcsok of the Entrepreneurs Party by Daniel Bodnar; place 
and date not given: "Liberal Civic Alliance -- Entrepreneurs' 
Party -- Deputy's Pay for Foundation"] 
  [Excerpts] With the approach of the parliamentary 
elections, parties outside Parliament, as well as the 
parliamentary parties, have launched their campaign and are 
seeking their "associates." We interviewed Peter Zwack and 
Lajos Kupcsok on this issue. [passage omitted] 
  [Bodnar] How would you characterize the Entrepreneurs' 
Party? 
  [Zwack] We mainly wish to deal with economic issues. I 
would like to remind people that in 1990, before I became a 
party chairman, I suggested to [former] Prime Minister Jozsef 
Antall that an economic top ministry should be set up; today, 
the need for this is recognized by many people. It is very 
important for a government to be able to approach issues from 
their practical side. 
  [Bodnar] What makes your party liberal? 
  [Zwack] Not the fact that it is said to be liberal. From 
the beginning, the goal of our party is to be more than the 
party of 600-700,000 small and medium size entrepreneurs, we 
also want to open to the intelligentsia and others. 
  [Kupcsok] I would like to mention two factors about the term 
liberal. One is that we want to reduce the state's intervention 
in the economy to the minimum and what is left should be 
operated with great deliberation. The other is that we reject 
all kind of racial, religious, or national discrimination. 
Ability and work, these our the two standards. 
  [Bodnar] You are member of the so-called Liberal Bloc 
together with the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], the 
Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], and the Agrarian 
Federation. What justifies the establishment of this bloc? 
  [Zwack] We feel that a new Hungarian political culture has 
to be established; to solve the problems, we need cooperation 
instead of discord. The liberal bloc can be suitable for this. 
I think it is important to mention that, at first, the 
Entrepreneurs Party made an agreement with the Fidesz in October 
1992, then with the SZDSZ, and the Agrarian Federation only 
joined us afterwards. Getting to government is the clear goal of 
the bloc. We feel that the government coalition did not fulfill 
the hopes of a large part of the population. Therefore, a 
change is needed. We firmly believe that socialist governing 
would not be advantageous for the country. It is very dangerous 
that a significant section of the population yearns for the 
"good old days," not knowing and not feeling the catastrophic 
consequences of this. In our view, however interesting the 
Bekesi program is, it is impossible to implement it. By its 
nature, a socialist economic program is distributive and, 
unfortunately, there is nothing to be distributed. This liberal 
center bloc is capable of establishing the conditions for an 
economic boom if it succeeds at the elections. I do not want to 
make false promises, we need everything but these. In my view, 
the situation is very difficult, putting the economy back on its 
feet will take many years of work, but the processes have to be 
speeded up. [passage omitted] 
  [Bodnar] What relationship do you have with the government 
coalition? 
  [Zwack] I am sorry that many people think I am against the 
government, this is a big mistake. I have many good 
acquaintances in the government and neither I nor the party are 
anti-government. As a matter of fact, only stupid people are 
against the government. I have problems with certain members of 
the government, and this will always be so, it unfortunately 
cannot be changed. I would be ready to extend my hand to them, 
but these people are unwilling. We have problems with certain 
-- mainly economic -- decisions of the government, and that it 
deals too much with ideological issues that are clearly damaging 
for the country. It might be enough to refer to the Csurka 
affair, the statement on the 15 million Hungarians, and the 
media war. 
  [Bodnar] What are your views on your party's election 
chances? 
  [Kupcsok] I very much hope that we will get into government 
and then we will be part of the government coalition. However, 
even if we do not get into legislation, we will be much stronger 
than now because we belong to the Liberal Bloc, therefore, even 
as a nonparliamentary party, we could help the next government 
much more effectively. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["S.I."-signed report: "Hungarians Beyond the Border and </F>
Regional Leading Role -- The MDF's National Foreign Policy"] 
  [Text] The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] sees the 
protection of the Hungarian minority beyond the border as the 
main task of Hungarian foreign policy. This is revealed by the 
party's foreign policy program, even though, formally, this 
issue only occupies the second place after its Europe policy. 
However, the program accepted by the MDF's national meeting 
last weekend -- which, after finalization, arrived at MAGYAR 
HIRLAP on 24 February -- advocates foreign policy with a 
national basis in almost all its paragraphs, and some kind of 
intention to achieve a regional leading role can also be 
detected in it. 
  Contrary to the big opposition parties (the Alliance of Free 
Democrats, the Federation of Young Democrats, and the Hungarian 
Socialist Party) whose program documents are scientifically 
based, were made with foreign affairs professional methods, and 
which also clarify theoretical issues, the MDF's foreign policy 
program is structured around election slogans ("We Have 
Preserved and Will Keep Our Country's Stability" or "Let the 
Hungarians Be the Motor of Development," "Let the National 
Minorities of Europe Have a Fair Future," and so on) and it does 
not deal with theoretical issues. 
  The MDF program names two major foreign political goals. The 
first one is full engagement in the life of developed Europe, 
and the second one is "establishing good relations with the 
neighboring countries such a way that this is concomitant with 
the lasting settlement of the situation of minority Hungarian 
national communities." This hierarchy of goals does not 
essentially differ from the priorities of the major opposition 
parties but almost all paragraphs of the MDF's program are 
permeated with the fact that the Hungarians beyond the border 
nevertheless have priority. 
  All the MDF program says about the issue of joining the 
European organizations is that "Hungary cannot be left out," but 
it does not talk about the necessary preparations. About NATO 
membership, it says that "the possibility of a full NATO 
membership has opened before us" but it does not deal with the 
problems posed by a possible NATO membership (the ones that can 
be raised, for example, if Hungary and its neighbors are not 
accepted into NATO at the same time). 
  The intention to acquire a regional leading role is the 
other 
important characteristic of the program. "It is the MDF's goal 
that, with the help of its policies and in accordance with our 
central position, Hungarians become an organizing force in 
Central Europe's economy through the abilities and industrious 
nature of our people." In other places, the program allows it 
to be felt that the MDF sees Hungary as an example to be 
followed by the neighboring countries. 
  The notion that was also part of the government program four 
years ago can again be seen: Relations with non-neighboring 
countries should be subordinated to politics relating to the 
Hungarians beyond the border. The MDF again declares that such 
relations have to be formed with the more distant countries 
which serve the interests relating to the Hungarians living 
beyond the border. 
  According to the MDF, the improvement of the Hungarian 
minorities's situation beyond the border is a task of the 
Hungarian Government's foreign policy. The program states that 
the national minorities have the right to self-determination, 
including territorial autonomy; it emphasizes that the 
application of collective national minority rights has to be 
urged at all international forums (which, however, is usually 
received with suspicion at the moment in Europe). 
  The program devotes much space to praising the achievements, 
and it attributes certain facts to the MDF's merit which did not 
have much to do with the MDF (for example, Hungary's acceptance 
to the Council of Europe in 1990, a few months after the 
establishment of the MDF government).

<F P=106> [Interview with Lajos Fur, defense minister and chairman of </F>
the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Maria Rozgics; place and date 
not given: "Be Faithful to Yourself -- Interview With Lajos Fur 
After His Inaugural Speech as Chairman"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] At the threshold of decisive 
new elections, juxtaposing Lajos Fur's former thoughts with his 
current ones, we would like to give food for thought to all 
those who might still be looking to 8 May with doubt and 
uncertainty. [passage omitted] 
  [Rozgics] In one of your interviews for UJ MAGYARORSZAG in 
January you referred to your book "I Would Like To Cry Freely" 
which had been published earlier. Today, it is no longer a 
question whether one is allowed to cry freely, we now are 
expecting you to say why it is worth crying? 
  [Fur] It is worth crying so that we succeed in continuing 
the policy that ensures freedom in the future, too, and through 
this freedom we can continue to build a real and true European 
democracy in Hungary. What we began with much toil and 
suffering has finally been completed, and once we have completed 
this building, we should utilize it well to live in, we should 
furnish it in a way worthy of humans, and fill it with balanced 
civic existence. [passage omitted] 
  [Rozgics] What are your views on the survival of the 
Hungarian nation? 
  [Fur] This issue might be even more difficult than the issue 
of the economy. We know the consequences of the long historical 
process. It is a very difficult issue. It has two components. 
The decline in the number of Hungarians in the country: It is 
public knowledge that we are 30-40 thousand fewer every year. 
Therefore, the reduction of the number of Hungarians in the 
country has to be stopped because this is one of the signs of 
decline. It is also known that the Hungarian nation is a nation 
torn apart, it constitutes huge minority groups. Stopping the 
decline in the size of the national minorities, and establishing 
such conditions with the majority country and the mother country 
in which they can survive, is a very bitter process. This is a 
difficult issue in this part of Europe, and in the West, too, 
although certain methods have been learned there. 
Unfortunately, we still have much to do before the conditions 
for the survival of national minorities can be guaranteed. I 
repeat that we also have to halt the country's domestic 
biological decline because we are decreasing. Unfortunately, 
year after year, we are decreasing. [passage omitted] 
  [Rozgics] In 1989, the Forum outlined three roads: red 
dictatorship, abyss, or democracy. What is the situation now? 
  [Fur] I also spoke about it at the [Hungarian Democratic 
Forum's MDF] National Meeting, that this had been at stake at 
the elections: Either the postcommunist dictatorship continues 
to vegetate, anarchy breaks out in the country, or we can switch 
over to a democracy in a constitutional and legal framework in a 
disciplined manner. Today, although the situation is not as 
keen, the question is what will happen to the country. Knowing 
society's sober attitude, I hope that anarchy is not threatening 
the country, but the danger of a left-wing change can certainly 
be felt. It is my firm view, that the question continues to be 
whether a constitutional, legal, calm, balanced, and secure 
democracy will continue to exist in Hungary. Although, this 
means hardship for many people and social groups. A left-wing 
change could mean an unpredictable and incalculable direction 
for democracy and everything that goes with it, namely the 
economy, and the change and transformation of society. The 
reflexes, thinking, and the political goals of the left wing are 
completely different from ours who are the sober political 
forces that honestly insist on democracy. 
  [Rozgics] The MDF announced the triple road of national 
liberalism, Christianity, and popular-national ideology. How 
are we to interpret these? 
  [Fur] This is not a road because it only leads to problems 
if a road goes in three directions. It is more appropriate to 
say that these are the ideological and political source of the 
MDF. The term tendency is too strong because tendencies can 
easily turn into independent political movements and divisions 
which have actually happened. This ideological and political 
source whose roots go back to the popular and national 
traditions that did not only represent the political activities 
of the populist writers of between the two world wars, but it 
could actually be taken back to Rakoczi and Bocskai [historical 
figures in 17-18th century]. Christian democracy is our other 
source which, in addition to modern Christian democracy, also 
means the values that Europe accumulated throughout the 2,000 
years of Christianity. This is a way of looking at and 
understanding the world, and it is not a world view. Naturally, 
it also includes the political thinking of the modern Christian 
democracy. The third part of our source is national liberalism 
that flourished in the 19th century, and since then, it has been 
a determining factor of Hungarian history. However, here, I am 
talking about nationally committed liberalism, rather than the 
supra-national liberalism that reflects a different attitude. 
We have been able to see these principles as important 
components of the MDF and still see them this way. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Gabor Kuncze, parliamentary group leader of </F>
the Alliance of Free Democrats, by Attila Zsoldos; place and 
date not given: "Kuncze on Success Propaganda"] 
  [Text] While he has been using very clever rhetoric since 
he was elected prime minister, Peter Boross has not implemented 
any real changes, Gabor Kuncze, prime ministerial candidate of 
the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] told NEPSZABADSAG. 
Kuncze named the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] as his 
party's strongest opponent at the elections. In his view, it 
has not yet been decided which tendency will become dominant in 
the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] after the elections. 
  [Zsoldos] After the MDF's national meeting and the MSZP's 
congress, what are your views on the SZDSZ's possibilities for 
making a coalition after the elections? 
  [Kuncze] We continue to maintain that this depends on the 
possibility to reconcile the programs, and this question can 
only be answered after the election results are known. 
  [Zsoldos] In the past, you said that an increasing number of 
tendencies exist in the MDF and you do not know which one will 
become the dominant one. Do you still hold the same view? 
  [Kuncze] It has not been possible to clarify our views on 
the MDF because we still do not know their program. On the 
basis of the ideas raised at the MDF's national meeting, it 
seems that, on the level of rhetoric, they are beginning to echo 
the proposals that the SZDSZ has long been representing in its 
amendment proposals. 
  [Zsoldos] Does this mean that, even after the election of 
Peter Boross as prime minister, it is still impossible precisely 
to determine the MDF's political line? 
  [Kuncze] I still see the coexistence of many tendencies in 
the MDF and it is impossible to know what weight they will have 
in the new parliament after May. 
  [Zsoldos] Which party does the SZDSZ see as its main 
election opponent? 
  [Kuncze] The MSZP, on the basis of the public opinion polls. 
  [Zsoldos] With the approach of the elections, what are the 
most dangerous phenomena in your view? 
  [Kuncze] As the official campaign period has not yet begun, 
I cannot give a clear answer to this. On one hand, I am afraid 
of the quite conceivable possibility that the forces that refer 
to the past 40 years will have too much presence in the MSZP's 
campaign. On the other hand, it can already be seen that the 
MDF has launched a success propaganda that does not reflect the 
real conditions. This is dangerous for the public opinion 
because it is misleading, and it is also dangerous for the MDF 
because it defines its program and its tasks for after the 
elections starting from an unrealistic situation. 
  [Zsoldos] The MDF's popularity increased after the election 
of Boross as prime minister. To what do you attribute this? 
  [Kuncze] According to the latest opinion polls, the 
temporary increase of the MDF's popularity has stopped. Boross, 
who has indeed been using a very clever rhetoric since his 
eleciton has not actually implemented any real changes in 
governing. The press is still loud with corruption cases in 
privatization. The fact that the government has replaced some 
of its members does not alter the fact that the institutional 
system that facilitates corruption is unchanged. Boross has 
also refused to make changes in the leadership of the television 
and radio although these can fundamentally influence the purity 
of the elections. Boross has been trying very hard to appear in 
an attractive manner for the public and draw the MDF with 
himself, nevertheless, the mistakes of the past four years will 
be a burden on the next governmental cycle. People draw the 
conclusions on the past four years on the basis of the contents 
of their wallets rather than on the basis of success propaganda.

  [Text] The Public Order Ministry spokesman reports that 
various political left-extermist forces continuously call for 
and incite illegal gatherings through their newspapers, 
particularly the Socialist Party with ZERI I POPULLIT. Such 
calls have increased greatly recently, on the eve of the trial 
of Fatos Nano, Ramiz Alia, and other blocmen. 
  The Public Order Ministry reports that it will act with the 
force of law against anyone who seeks to exert pressure on 
Albanian justice, which has an independent and inviolable power. 
At the same time, it undertakes to guarantee order, calm, and 
stability for the organs of justice, so that they can develop 
their legal activity as normally as possible. 
  The Public Order Ministry warns all violators, whoever they 
are, that they will be responsible before the law.

  [Text] The Socialist Party [PS] Managing Committee of 
Tirana city organized a meeting last night at the Asllan Rusi 
Sports Palace. Let us follow the report by correspondent Armir 
Shkurti. 
  [Shkurti] At the beginning of this meeting, Luan Shahollari, 
chairman of the PS Managing Committee for Tirana, said that the 
meeting was organized to detail the questions set forward in the 
party's second national conference as well as to protest against 
the violation of basic human rights and freedoms. Mr. 
Shahollari stated that the PS second conference decided on a new 
political solution -- to hold new, early elections. Among the 
main questions treated in the second conference, the speaker 
selected the establishment of a social market economy instead of 
a free market, the attitude toward the national question, and 
the PS's international stance as a branch of the European left. 
  At the end of his speech, Mr. Shahollari considered the 
solitary confinement of former Prime Minister Fatos Nano by the 
court to be unjust and requested his release. 
  PS Deputy Chairman Servet Pellumbi mentioned once again 
early 
elections as a new political solution. Mr. Pellumbi called on 
the PS to be a force capable of stepping up the democratic 
processes. That is why he requested it to listen more to the 
voice of the opposition and practice political dialogue. Mr. 
Pellumbi also considered the arrest of former Premier Fatos Nano 
to be unjust and asked his immediate release. Later, the 
meeting focused only on the demand to release former Prime 
minister Fatos Nano. 
  Mr. Namik Dokle mentioned documents and messages of 
international institutions in support of Nano. 
  At the end of the meeting, a protest addressed to the 
highest 
institutions of the Albanian state and to international 
organizations was read. In the name of the PS members and 
sympathizers in the city, the protest considered the arrest of 
former Prime Minister Nano unfair. At the end, the protest 
declared that the PS members and sympathizers in the capital 
will continue to protest this case with all democratic ways and 
means.

  [Text] Rome, March 2 (AFP) -- The latest peace initiatives 
on the Bosnian crisis are "encouraging" and could lead to a 
resumption of three-way talks in Geneva, UN peace negotiatior 
Thorvald Stoltenberg said here Wednesday. 
  "We are seeing some movement" from the various parties 
involved in the conflict, Stoltenberg said, referring to an 
agreement by the Serbs to reopen the airport in the besieged 
northeastern Bosnian town of Tuzla and to a Moslem-Croat accord 
to form a federation. He said these "developments could be 
important for further negotiations" and "prove it is absolutely 
necessary that the European Union, the United States and Russia 
cooperate on this difficult issue." Stoltenberg said he would 
soon be heading back to Geneva to monitor developments in Bosnia. 
  His counterpart for the European Union, Lord Owen, meanwhile 
said in Geneva that it would be unreasonable for Europe to feel 
sidelined because of the U.S.-brokered Moslem-Croat pact. 
  "I do not think it is sensible in Europe to feel any sense 
of 
anxiety, frustration or a feeling of being set aside. This is 
something that the European Union has been urging the United 
States to do as long as I remember," he told journalists. 
  Owen said: "In the first instance it seems that the most 
important thing to do is for the Americans to carry forward 
their initiative in the meetings that are planned to start on 
Friday in Vienna and are hoped to end on the 15th which is to 
tie down all the details of the Croat-Moslem federation and the 
wider confederation between Croatia and the federation." 
  The European negotiator said he felt it would be a "great 
mistake" to see this development as one "against the interest of 
the Bosnian Serbs."

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 3 March carries in its 
regular 10-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in 
the republic. Reception is fair. 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 1st Corps Information Center 
reports from Sarajevo that "this morning just after 0800 the 
chetniks fired with small arms on members of the UN Protection 
Forces [UNPROFOR] in the Jewish cemetery area. UNPROFOR 
immediately returned fire. The aggressor also directed small 
arms fire at Mijatovica Kosa." 
  Describing the situation in the Bihac region, Mirza 
Sadikovic 
describes "yet another hellish night here, with incessant 
shelling of the defense positions in (Grabez) and Hasin Vrh. 
After firing hundreds of howitzer shells and mortars, the 
chetniks attempted an infantry breakthrough at (Vrh), but the 
5th Corps' heroic defenders managed to repulse it." He says 
that "around midnight they [the Serbs] mercilessly shelled the 
center of Cazin and its outskirts." 
  Summing up the military situation yesterday in its 
operational zone, the Bosnia-Herzegovina 3rd Corps Press Center 
says that "it was relatively quiet. The chetniks intensified 
their small arms fire on the Zavidovici front, and occasionally 
shelled the defense lines and civilian targets from 
(Podseljanici), (Podmalovani), and Glavica. They were seen 
regrouping and bringing in more military hardware, and frequent 
helicopter flights were also reported on the Mt. Ozren-(Vozuca) 
route. The chetniks fired several 120-mm mortar and B-1 
artillery shells at Bugojno, wounding one child. They also 
fired five 60-mm mortars at Mala (Oporista) on the defense line 
toward Teslic." He says that "the cease-fire in central Bosnia 
was seriously violated last night at 1840 in Vitez, when a group 
of HVO fighters entered no-man's land near (Ciganluk) and blew 
up a house. Sporadic provocative fire was registered in this 
region, particularly around Kruscica, [words indistinct]. As 
for Gornji Vakuf, the HVO fighters fired several 60-mm and 82-mm 
mortars. On the other parts of the front, there were absolutely 
no violations, particularly in the Bilalovac region, where not a 
single bullet was fired." 
  In his report from Gracanica, Izudin Durakovic says that 
"over the last 24 hours, the enemy continued to attack the 
entire front line in the operational zone of Operative Group 2. 
The chetniks launched their heaviest attacks on the Trebava 
part of the front. Using heavy artillery support, they attempted 
an infantry attack toward (Prijeko Brdo) and Lukavica, but the 
defenders were not taken by surprise. Indeed, a 
counteroffensive enabled them to extend the front line to our 
advantage. The chetniks will most certainly try to recapture 
that territory today." He says that "as for the Doboj front, 
the chetniks fired 80-mm and 120-mm mortars at the defense lines 
and at civilian targets in Brijesnica, (Stanic Rijeka), and 
(Klopotnica). On the Lukavac front, the chetniks fired from 
Vijenac at residential areas, killing one civilian and wounding 
three. At the moment of filing this report, the enemy is 
shelling Gracanica, and the general alarm has been in force 
since 0635 this morning." 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 4th Corps reports from Mostar 
that "the cease-fire is generally being observed here. There 
are still some provocative bursts of small arms fire and sniper 
activity on the streets of Mostar, and intersections in the city 
center. The HVO fighters were somewhat more active on the 
southern parts of the Mostar area. One 120-mm mortar was fired 
from the enemy positions, while antiaircraft machine guns were 
firing sporadically at the defense lines. Negotiations on the 
exchange of prisoners of war are to continue today in 
Medjugorje." He says that "overnight and this morning have been 
quiet."

  [Excerpts] Zagreb, March 3 (AFP) -- The commander of UN 
troops in the former Yugoslavia, General Jean Cot, on Thursday 
[3 March] asked the United States to rush troops to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to consolidate the ceasefire, particularly in 
Sarajevo. 
  The UN Secretary General's special envoy for the region, 
Yasushi Akashi, meanwhile criticized the international community 
for its "lukewarm and negative response up to date" on the 
urgent need to send reinforcements to Bosnia. He said the UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) needed an additional 10,650 troops 
immediately, 4,600 of them to be deployed in Sarajevo and the 
remainder to monitor a ceasefire agreement between the Moslems 
and Bosnian Croats in central and southern Bosnia. 
  Cot echoed Akashi's criticism saying that NATO's readiness 
to 
send troops to Bosnia only after a global peace accord is 
reached "was a funny and not very courageous idea." "They can 
all change their mind and send troops tomorrow if they wanted," 
he said. "I really wish the United States could dispatch ground 
troops tomorrow. 
  "What I need are troops immediately and the nations that can 
send send these troops immediately can be counted on one hand -- 
the Americans, the British and the French." 
  He said NATO initially was considering sending 100,000 
additional troops to Bosnia but the number had been reduced by 
half, to 50,000. 
  "Today, I'm asking for 10,000, and if they don't want all 
the 
headway we've made in Sarajevo to fall through, we need these 
troops immediately," Cot warned. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile in Britain, a serious clash is looming between the 
British Government and defence chiefs over the government's 
refusal to send more troops to Bosnia, the DAILY TELEGRAPH 
reported Thursday. Military service chiefs say the 2,300 troops 
there are so thinly spread that they could be dangerously 
exposed if the war worsens, it said.

  [Text] Novi Sad, 2 Mar (TANJUG) -- We have conveyed our 
view to the Russian side that we do not oppose in the least the 
agreement between the Croats and Muslims, provided it is 
directed toward peace, Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the 
assembly of the Srpska republic [RS] and member of the RS 
delegation in Moscow, told Novi Sad radio today. 
  "Developments have so far shown that the intentions of the 
Croats and Muslims are such as to form a block against the 
Serbian side," he said. "We are going to exchange views on this 
today with the speaker of the Upper House of the Russian 
Federation in Moscow." 
  Krajisnik said it is the U.S. Administration's mistake to 
assume that the Serbs will bow to pressure and do something 
against the Serbian people's interests. He noted over the phone 
that the Serbs have offered maximum concessions to the Muslims 
-- 33.3 percent of territory -- in order to secure peace among 
all three national communities in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "However, the Serbs will not accept a solution that would be 
considerably detrimental to the Serbian people's strategic 
interests. This is why we regard this agreement in Washington as 
some sort of action against the Serbian people. It is 
incomprehensible that such an agreement is being drawn up which 
isolates the Serbs, and which intends to create an artificial 
and unfeasible entity." 
  Krajisnik warned that the division of the Serbian part of 
the 
territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina could be dangerous: "Our 
messages are: Don't count your chickens before they are hatched, 
and that there can be no peace if one tries to exclude Serbs 
from the agreement." 
  The president of the Srpska republic assembly said that, had 
the organizers of the Washington meeting been in favor of an 
agreement with the Serbs, they would have invited them to attend 
the conference and tackled the problem together. 
  "It is inconceivable that anyone should conclude an 
agreement 
between Croats and Muslims and then impose this stand on the 
Serbs," he said. 
  Krajisnik said that the Serbs cannot be forced to have 
one-third of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina territory because 
they own 64 percent of the territory. 
  "A just solution and peace cannot be achieved by means of 
pressure, blackmail, and ultimatums. Such a practice can only 
prolong the war," said Krajisnik in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Statement by Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris </F>
Silajdzic in Washington on 2 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] We have made the biggest step toward peace. I think 
that the signing of the agreement last night should mark the 
beginning of a process to (?eliminate) the conflict and to 
(?regulate) an overall peace in the new, territorially 
reorganized part of our homeland. In other words, this is an 
indispensable prerequisiste for creating specific conditions: 
first, to facilitate the return of all refugees and displaced 
persons. This we see as being the most important issue. In 
other words, everyone to return to his or her home. This is our 
main goal. We know it will be difficult to attain it but we are 
working on it. 
  Second, to begin the process of reconstruction, development, 
and consolidation in our country both by relying on our own 
resources and with the help from the international community -- 
this was the topic of discussion with Mr. Preston, the president 
of the World Bank, in particular, and with Vice President Gore 
and Mr. Christopher on several occasions. 
  I must say -- and we stressed this point last night during 
the signing ceremony -- that this agreement would not have been 
possible without the direct involvement on the part of the 
United States and of top U.S. officials. 
  We have been trying for two years to give the U.S. public a 
true picture of Bosnia-Herzegovina, to spur the U.S. public and 
leadership. The seeds we have been sowing for two years are now 
sprouting. It seems to us that Washington, the capital of the 
democratic United States, is the right place for both the talks 
and the signing of this preliminary agreement and the final 
agreement which, we hope, will be signed by Presidents 
Izetbegovic and Tudjman on 15 March. That is the date we 
arranged. We hope that all work will be completed by then. 
  However, this diplomatic activity was made possible by the 
heroic efforts of our soldiers who liberated parts of the 
territory. This was a basis for the diplomatic and political 
activity. We have proved that we were not only a political but 
also a military factor without which diplomatic activity could 
never be sufficiently successful. 
  A great deal of work still needs to be done. Above all we 
must maintain this level of involvement and interest on the part 
of the United States, the allies, Russia, and UN member 
countries to achieve peace. For this reason we will be going to 
Moscow to meet Minister Kozyrev and other officials. Russia is 
without a doubt an important international factor and we will 
try to examine possibilities of an agreement with the Serb side. 
  I expect a lot of work on the preparation and the drawing up 
of the federation's constitution and the confederal agreement 
with Croatia. This work will be accomplished at the U.S. 
Embassy in Vienna. A team of experts has already been sent 
there. Once the text of the constitution and the confederal 
agreement between the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
Republic of Croatia has been coordinated, Presidents Izetbegovic 
and Tudjman are expected to sign these agreements in Washington. 
Very little time remains and a great deal of work needs to be 
done. 
  To conclude, I still have another meeting today in the State 
Department in connection with further activities and talks.

  [Text] At last night's festivity held in a secretariat in 
Washington, after several days of negotiations, two preliminary 
agreements were signed. One concerns the joint federal state of 
Muslims and Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina and another the 
confederation of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Croatia. The 
agreements were signed by Dr. Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina, Kresimir Zubak, representative of the 
Croats of Bosnia- Herzegovina, and Dr. Mate Granic, minister of 
foreign affairs of the Republic of Croatia. 
  The agreement on the joint state of Muslims and Croats 
envisages the creation of a federal state with a strong central 
authority but also with a high degree of autonomy for the 
federal units. It is envisaged that in the federation, the 
central authorities would be in charge of defense of the 
country, economy, foreign politics, finances, and trade. The 
federal units would be of decisive influence in the organization 
of police, schooling, health services, and other spheres. 
  The preliminary agreement on creating a confederation of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia 
envisages looser relations between the two states, something 
that could be furthered later. Details of these agreements will 
be worked on in detail by transitory councils that will begin 
working in Vienna at the end of this week. The agreements 
should be ratified by the two countries' assemblies.

  [Text] Bileca, 3 March (TANJUG) -- The information service 
of the [Bosnian Serb army] Herzegovina corps said this morning 
that Muslim forces resumed their sporadic combat activities in 
the upper and central Drina river basin last night. More 
intense Muslim attacks were in evidence in the wider Gorazde 
area. The targets were Foca and Cajnice. 
  Serb military sources said that despite their latest 
agreement, Croats and Muslims had resumed their clashes in the 
Neretva valley. Fighting went on throughout the night in 
Mostar's southern zone, and in the area of Jablanica, TANJUG has 
learned from Serb military sources.

  [Excerpt] According to Croatian Defense Council [HVO] 
sources, Muslim forces seriously violated the cease-fire east of 
Prozor where they launched an infantry attack on the HVO 
positions near the village of Uzdol. The attack was repelled. 
The UN Protection Forces have been informed. 
  Snipers were mainly responsible for cease-fire violations on 
other battlefields. One elderly person was wounded in the 
western part of Mostar by a sniper shot fired from Muslim 
positions. According to the Herceg-Bosna ministry of defense, 
snipers have lightly wounded two persons. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Serb aggression against the free parts of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is not letting up. Following the tried and 
tested Sarajevo ploy, the criminal [Serb military leader Ratko] 
Mladic's gunners continue to murder civilians. 
  After yesterday's massacre in Bihac, when 11 citizens were 
killed and dozens wounded in a queue for the distribution of 
humanitarian aid, the Serb aggressor is again today attacking 
this region ferociously. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps 
fighters are still managing to repulse all these attacks, 
unshakable in their commitment to defend their people and their 
territories.

  [Text] The Serbian aggressor this morning resumed 
artillery-infantry attacks on the Bihac region. Defenders at 
(Vlasko), Hasino Brdo, and Grmusko-Srbljanski Heights have been 
submitted to unprecedented howitzer and tank fire, which has 
killed a large number of them. Although they have been 
suffering constant losses in manpower and military hardware, the 
chetniks are still mindlessly attacking. Heroes of the 5th 
Corps have destroyed one enemy antiaircraft gun, two ZIS 
weapons, and several motor vehicles, which obviously serves the 
chetniks with a reason to continue and increase their wild 
artillery activity on Bihac, Cazin, and their outskirts. There 
are dozens of injured civilians due to the systematic 
destruction of settlements over the last 24 hours. Local 
hospitals are full, and there are hardly any basic first aid 
kits. Chetnik helicopters are still freely flying over the 
Bihac area bringing in new manpower and new artillery. The 
world is still calmly observing this [word indistinct] and 
disappearance of people and tows from the face of the earth.

  [Text] Vitez, Bosnia-Herzegovina, March 3 (AFP) - The 
Moslem-led Bosnian Army has come under "heavy shelling" from 
Bosnian Serbs in the northern Tuzla area but a Moslem-Croat 
truce generally held in central Bosnia-Herzegovina, western 
military sources said Thursday [3 March]. 
  "Tension increased with heavy shelling in the morning and in 
the afternoon" of Wednesday, said the sources in central Bosnia. 
  Some 250 shells exploded over the worst-hit area, the 
Bosnian 
army-held Gradacac and Brcko zone, 40 kilometers (25 miles) 
north of Tuzla, while 190 shells rained down on a "confrontation 
line" about five kilometers (three miles) east of Lukavac, near 
Tuzla. Automatic gun fire and and mortar fire was reported at 
the front lines, the sources added. 
  In central Bosnia, the ceasefire signed Friday by Bosnian 
Croats and Moslems appeared to have been generally respected. 
In the southern city of Mostar, the truce was "almost 
respected." Five shells hit the Croat-besieged eastern part of 
the town, where some 50,000 Moslems are holed up. 
  A joint Croat and Moslem committee is to meet around midday 
Thursday at Gornji Vakuf, 60 kilometers (35 miles) west of 
Sarajevo. It will be their third meeting since the truce was 
signed a week ago. 
  Gornji Vakuf marks the front line between Croat forces and 
the Bosnian Army in southern Bosnia and is where the situation 
is considered "most volatile," the sources said. However the 
sources were unable Thursday to confirm a report that the 
Bosnian Army had launched an offensive Wednesday in the east of 
the war-torn town. 
  The sources said they believed the Bosnian Army might try to 
grab more territory before the joint committee, presided over by 
the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), firmly established where the 
front lines lay.

  [Text] At the time of filing this report, and it is 1400 
now, all the defense lines in the zone of the 7th South 
Operative Group are under fierce attack, as the [Serb] aggressor 
tries to capture Maglaj. The united [B-H Army and HVO, Croatian 
Defense Council] units are not yielding an inch of the free 
territories of Tesanj, Maglaj, Doboj, and Teslic. 
  At about noon today, the heaviest artillery and infantry 
attack so far was repulsed in the region of (Suskova Kosa) and 
Bandera. During the day an infantry attack on (Planike) was been 
repelled, where our fighters inflicted heavy losses on the 
enemy. Some 20 chetniks were killed, and the same number were 
wounded. 
  In the operational zone of the 203d Glorious Motorized 
Doboj-Bosnia Brigade, the aggressor has been attacking 
ferociously, but to no avail. Civilian targets are coming under 
continuous shelling, while sniper fire is incessant in 
(Miljevac), (Bugarilovici), and (Jelovci). 
  We know for a fact that chetniks Rade (Subotic) and Nebojsa 
Milakovic are particularly notorious for killing civilians. One 
of them is responsible for killing a one-year-old child in its 
mother's arms, as she was on her way from [word indistinct] to 
the Tesanj war hospital.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 3 (AFP) -- UN officials maintained 
Thursday [3 March] that a ceasefire was holding throughout 
Bosnia-Herzegovina despite reports of shelling in various 
regions including the Bosnian capital. 
  "The ceasefire is going well all over Bosnia-Herzegovina 
except for small arms fire which is basically insignificant," 
said Lieutenant Colonel Bill Aikman, spokesman for the UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR). 
  Earlier, Bosnian Serb forces besieging Sarajevo fired four 
mortars toward positions of the mainly Moslem Bosnian Army in 
the southern part of the city and small arms fire could be heard 
for about five minutes. 
  Aikman said UN military observers enforcing a ceasefire 
agreement that went into effect last month were immediately 
dispatched to the region to restore calm. "In Sarajevo, the 
ceasefire is holding," Aikman said. "As you can see, the people 
can walk and be comfortable." 
  Since February 20, the deadline set by NATO to launch air 
strikes against the Serbs if they failed remove their heavy 
weapons from around Sarajevo or place them under UN control, the 
Sebs have surrendered 276 cannons and the Bosnian Army has 
handed in 47, Aikman said. 
  Elsewhere in Bosnia Thursday, UN military observers reported 
troop movement around the northern town of Brcko, which has come 
under heavy shelling by the Serbs. Western military sources 
said some 250 shells exploded Wednesday in the region of 
Gradacac and Brcko, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Tuzla, 
while 190 shells rained down on a "confrontation line" about 
five kilometers (three miles) east of Lukavac, near Tuzla. 
Automatic gun fire and mortar fire was reported at the front 
lines, the sources added. 
  "Tension increased with heavy shelling in the morning and in 
the afternoon" of Wednesday, the sources said. 
  Further west in the town of Bihac, local Moslem troops 
successfully thwarted an attempt by the Serbs to infiltrate the 
town while the situation in Mostar, divided between Croat and 
Moslem troops, was said to be "very calm" Thursday despite five 
shells falling on the Moslem sector. 
  In central Bosnia, the ceasefire signed Friday by Bosnian 
Croats and Moslems appeared to have been generally respected. 
  As for the northern town of Maglaj, which is besieged by the 
Serbs, UN officials were unable to update the situation there 
Thursday following reports that 4,000 shells had fallen on the 
city and neighboring towns the previous day. 
  Kris Janowski, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), said his agency was still waiting for the 
Serbs to allow a relief convoy to reach the city. 
  Relief convoys to Maglaj, whose pre-war population of 16,000 
was 45 percent Moslem, were suspended in October after two UNHCR 
drivers were killed just outside a tunnel that leads to the city.

<F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta: "The United Nations Is </F>
Concerned That Czech Masks Might Be Used by the Croatian Army"] 
  [Text] Prague--The UN Sanctions Committee expressed its 
concerns that the gas masks that the Zubri Rubber Works wanted 
to export to Croatia could ultimately be used by the Army. The 
Croatian Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs stated in the 
purchase request that most of the masks are intended for firemen 
and a smaller number for the civilian population. 
  Dlouhy's Ministry of Industry and Trade originally consulted 
on the sale with the Foreign Ministry, which, in turn, submitted 
the request for assessment to the appropriate UN committee. 
Acting on its recommendation, the License Administration of the 
Ministry of Industry and Trade has not granted the Zubri Rubber 
Works the required export license. 
  A diplomatic official who does not wish to be named for fear 
of difficulties at work told MLADA FRONTA DNES yesterday that, 
although the Czech Republic and Croatia were to be trading 
partners, the actual initiator of the contact was a certain 
Slovak firm that mediated this deal for the Zubri Rubber Works. 
The rubber works would have received almost 45 million korunas 
for the sale of the gas masks to Croatia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Viktor </F>
Krejci; place and date not given: "The Issue Did Not Involve 
Individual Sudeten German Claims"] 
  [Text] [Krejci] You allegedly said in an interview for 
FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG that negotiations on claims by 
Sudeten Germans for compensation should be held not on the basis 
of the collective principle but individually. 
  [Klaus] Not a word was said in my interview for this 
newspaper about compensation for individual Sudeten Germans. 
The issue does not involve compensation, but resolving this 
issue. These are two completely different things. I proceeded 
from the premise that, in harmony with our concept for 
individual rights, we do not like to hear ideas about collective 
rights and solutions. If, however, this or that German--I do 
not say Sudeten German on purpose--shows an interest in moving 
to the Czech Republic, settling here, and acquiring state 
citizenship, then that is in order. This is exactly what we 
have always said; I was merely making a distinction between 
collective and individual solutions. 
  [Krejci] So, you did not discuss claims? 
  [Klaus] Not a word was said about claims. This newspaper is 
one of those publications that does not publish interviews on 
principle. A journalist records an interview with someone, then 
writes an article based on it and places quotations from what he 
said between quotation marks. The interviewee does not have the 
slightest opportunity, however, to influence their order or 
choice. I refrain from such interviews-non-interviews and I only 
give them to journalists that I know and trust, which applies in 
the case of FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG. I think that the 
article published in this newspaper gave a faithful account of 
the essence of our conversation. 
  [Krejci] The Civic Democratic Party [ODS] Executive Council 
has entrusted you with holding talks with the representatives of 
the Jewish communities. Why? 
  [Klaus] The Civic Democratic Party cannot countenance the 
accusations being made against it by certain political entities 
for allegedly not respecting Jewish traditions or the suffering 
of the Jews during World War II. We cannot condone this 
offensive, deliberate, and calculated tactic. 
  [Krejci] How do you assess the behavior of your coalition 
partners during the parliamentary vote on the property belonging 
to the Jewish communities? 
  [Klaus] In my opinion, this was trivial. If someone leaves 
the chamber because, by chance, his view does not prevail, his 
is not the practice of normal political life. Several votes 
have been held in the government on this draft, and I have to 
say that I have not always won. The government's point of view 
on the draft for this law was not exactly what I would have 
wished; despite this, I did not make the proceedings impossible, 
and I did not walk out. I would ask other people not act like 
this. 
  [Krejci] What do you expect from the ODS Commission that has 
been charged with looking into the possibility of resolving the 
issue of Jewish property on the basis of a government decision? 
  [Klaus] There is a strong view within the government, which 
I like, according to which this issue could be resolved outside 
the law, simply by an executive decision on returning the 
property in state ownership. At the same time, the communities 
would be asked to consider doing the same thing. The ODS 
Executive Committee would be pleased if this path were embarked 
upon. This means finding the right method, and the free 
transfer could take place. 
  [Krejci] Will this solution be acceptable to the coalition 
partners? 
  [Klaus] I do not envisage that the coalition partners would 
want to block the issue of returning Jewish property. 
  [Krejci] Should this method also be applied in the case of 
church property? 
  [Klaus] If this were to turn out to be a quick and viable 
method, I would not have anything against it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Bratinka by </F>
Kristian Chalupa in Brno on 26 February: "The Middle East Peace 
Process Has Not Ended"] 
  [Text] Pavel Bratinka, Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA] 
deputy chairman and deputy foreign minister, took part in the 
meeting of the ODA Central Assembly in Brno on Saturday [26 
February]. We took the opportunity to ask him for a brief 
interview. 
  [Chalupa] Ivan Mjartan, Slovak ambassador to the Czech 
Republic, described, in an interview for our newspaper, 
Czech-Slovak relations as being very favorable. Do you identify 
with this view? 
  [Bratinka] Of course, relations between the Czech and Slovak 
Republics are good, but they could be better. After all, the 
economies of the two states are more dependent on each other 
and, for this reason, there should be as few problems as 
possible in mutual trade. It is obvious that there will be 
certain problems; we have to work to get rid of them. 
  [Chalupa] Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia Central 
Committee Chairman Grebenicek declared at a recent news 
conference that pressure from various groups abroad is behind 
the various approaches in the government coalition to resolving 
the Bosnian crisis.... 
  [Bratinka] If someone were to say that different states have 
different interests, it would be the truth--the banal truth. 
However, I steadfastly reject any suggestion that a struggle 
among various foreign power-wielding groups is taking place in 
the government. 
  [Chalupa] Your ministry is preparing a draft government 
decree that should make it easier for individual compatriots to 
resettle in the Czech Republic. This decree should also concern 
the Kazakh Czechs. When will this matter be discussed in the 
government? 
  [Bratinka] This decree is being prepared by the Interior 
Ministry, and we should merely add our comments. I cannot tell 
you at the moment when this will come onto the government's 
agenda; this is within the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's 
Office and the prime minister himself. The question is whether 
these people should be given, without bureaucratic holdups, 
permanent residency permits, at least for the first phase. The 
Foreign Ministry is monitoring the situation in Kazakhstan; we 
can add our points of view. If people are to be resettled, 
then, of course, our diplomats and our representative offices 
will be very active in this matter. 
  [Chalupa] What do you think of the chances for the recently 
initiated Middle East peace process following the bloody 
massacre in Hebron? 
  [Bratinka] The peace process was initiated because logic was 
moving in this direction. Although it will be slowed down or in 
a way impaired, the overall headway and the overall direction 
and aim will be maintained. This is a matter of reason, a 
matter that, the longer it is postponed, the greater the risk of 
such murderous behavior on both sides. This massacre highlights 
the need for a definitive solution. I do not think that the 
Middle East peace process has ended.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jaroslav Ortman, chairman of the Left Bloc </F>
Deputies Club, by Jana Sprunkova and Jan Stetka; place and date 
not given: "The ODS Is Attempting To Control the Senate"] 
  [Text] Jaroslav Ortman, chairman of the Left Bloc 
Deputies' Club, is concerned that, through the currently drafted 
laws on elections to the Senate, Chamber of Deputies, and local 
administration, the government coalition parties intend to 
reinforce their power and throw the present opposition out of 
the game. Therefore, LIDOVE NOVINY asked Ortman several 
questions. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] What is the reason for your concern? 
  [Ortman] I believe that the Civic Democratic Party [ODS], 
which advocates the one-seat wards for the Senate elections, 
wants to assume complete control over this body. It depends on 
its unrivalled position confirmed by public opinion surveys. If 
other parties of the coalition want to work their way into the 
Senate, they must endorse the three-seat alternative--namely, if 
a joint slate of the coalition parties is not established, the 
Civic Democratic Alliance, the Christian and Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, and the Christian Democratic 
Party have no chance of having senators. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Is the position of the opposition parties 
any different? 
  [Ortman] In the example of the one-seat wards, the 
opposition would also remain without senators. The clash over 
the number of seats, however, will be a bone of contention for 
most of the coalition parties. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Are you in favor of introducing candidate 
deposits in the elections? 
  [Ortman] The deposits contradict Article 18 of the Czech 
Constitution on the principle of equality. Our state abandoned 
property censuses with the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 
Property censuses do not belong in modern legal systems. If 
20,000 korunas per candidate is being considered now, this 
amount over time could climb to a million, and then it certainly 
would be discriminating. The censuses principle is a catch 
placed like a time bomb in the election law. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Are you worried about the reduced number of 
local administration members following the local elections? The 
government has proposed a reduction by as much as one-half. 
  [Ortman] Imagine that small communities would have just 
three aldermen who must choose one of them to be the mayor, 
whether the communal property is to be released, some cultural 
object is to be sold, etc. In a town with a population of tens 
of thousands, there might be just seven aldermen. These people 
would concentrate in their hands an unbelievable power. For the 
coalition parties, I would use the slogan "Oh Lord, how low I 
have sunk." Just to fill their slates, they are willing to 
sacrifice the number of members of the administrations. In 
principle, the status quo should be preserved. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] It is well known that the Left Bloc deputies 
would best like it if the Senate were removed from the 
Constitution. Do you not believe it occasionally necessary that 
the poor laws adopted by parliament be caught in time by the 
Senate and thus prevent unnecessary amendments? 
  [Ortman] The Senate would really play the role of a guard 
dog. We have, however, other insurances--namely, the president 
with the power to return the laws and the Constitutional Court. 
The poor laws are, above all, the result of hasty and inferior 
work in parliamentary committees. In this respect, the decisive 
factor is the composition of the Constitutional and Legal 
Affairs Committee, the present expert knowledge of which does 
not provide any guarantee of quality. Some parties even 
assigned people who are not lawyers to this committee.

  [Text] The Interior Ministry has turned down the 
application for the registration of a new right-wing party, the 
Democratic Union [Demokraticka Unie]. Milah Hulik, member of 
the preparatory committee, said that the application was turned 
down because only 700 out of a total of 1,570 signatures 
supplied were accepted. The law requires at least 1,000 
signatures for a political party to be registered. Allegedly, 
another reason for the decision was certain unusual features in 
the Democratic Union's program. 
  Milan Hulik was hopeful that the reasons for turning down 
the 
application would be removed and that the new right-wing party 
would be registered as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [Czech Statistical Office report: "Foreign Trade of the </F>
Czech Republic Developed Successfully in 1993"] 
  [Text] The trade balance ended with a surplus of 5.9 
billion korunas [Kc], while changes in the territorial structure 
continued, particularly as a result of the Slovak Republic 
becoming a foreign trading partner. Firms that used to deal 
with Slovak enterprises had to start using customs documents and 
transfer from domestic to foreign trading relations. Changes 
also continued in the structure of imports and exports according 
to the individual categories of goods. The share of fuels and 
raw materials in imports declined in comparison with the 
preceding year. The share of machines and vehicles in exports 
increased. While import prices declined, export prices rose, 
and real trade relations developed favorably. 
  If we do not include trade with Slovakia, for which there 
are 
no 1992 data, in comparison with the preceding year, exports 
grew faster than imports in 1993. While exports grew by 20 
percent, imports rose by only 2.7 percent. The volume of 
foreign trade increased by 10.6 percent. 
  The total value of imports, including imports from Slovakia, 
reached Kc366.4 billion, and the total value of exports, 
including exports to Slovakia, amounted to Kc372.3 billion. The 
trade balance was in surplus each month until May, there was a 
small deficit in June, and this trend continued in July as the 
deficit grew. Then there was a surplus in August, September, 
and October, while the balance showed a deficit again in 
November and December. 
  From the territorial vantage point, the share of the total 
foreign trade turnover (including trade with Slovakia, which is 
responsible for 18.9 percent of the total) with states with an 
advanced market economy amounted to 58 percent (European Union 
[EU] states 43 percent and EFTA [European Free Trade 
Association] countries 10.4 percent), the former Soviet Union to 
8.7 percent, developing countries 6.8 percent, European states 
with transitional economies (except for the former USSR) 6.1 
percent, and states with a state trade system 1.5 percent. 
  According to preliminary calculations, in January to 
November 
1993, import prices declined by 1.1 percent in comparison with 
the same period of the preceding year, and the physical volume 
of imports rose by more than 17 percent. Export prices rose by 
2 percent, while the physical volume of exports rose by 15 
percent. Real trade relations reached a value of 103.1 points. 
  In trade with the Slovak Republic, imports reached Kc65 
billion in 1993, and exports Kc74.6 billion. The trade surplus 
amounted to Kc9.6 billion. Industrial goods were dominant in 
the exchange of goods and raw materials, with 33.8 percent of 
total imports and 26.3 percent of total exports, and machines 
and vehicles, with 23.8 percent of total imports and 25.9 
percent of total exports. 
  Imports from countries with an advanced market economy rose 
by 7.5 percent in 1993 in comparison with the preceding year, 
and exports to these countries by 24.2 percent. The trade 
balance was in deficit to the tune of Kc12.1 billion, but there 
was a surplus of Kc7.5 billion in trade with EU countries. 
Trade with the EFTA countries resulted in a deficit of Kc12.0 
billion. The single most important trading partner among these 
countries was the FRG, with a 26 percent share of the total 
turnover of Czech foreign trade, followed by Austria (6.9 
percent) and Italy (4.9 percent). Imports were dominated by 
machines and vehicles, which made up almost half of all goods 
and materials; exports by industrial goods with a 31.9 percent 
share of the total. Trade with the OECD countries also 
flourished. Imports from these countries reached Kc209.9 
billion, increasing by 7.5 percent in comparison with the 
preceding year; exports amounted to Kc200 billion and increased 
by 24.1 percent. The trade showed a deficit of Kc9.9 billion. 
  Imports from the developing countries increased by 8.7 
percent and exports to this region by 29.2 percent, in 
comparison with 1992. The trade surplus amounted to Kc13.5 
billion. Almost 30 percent of imports were food and livestock, 
and 35.6 percent were machines and vehicles. About 45 percent 
of exports were machines and vehicles, and, at almost 38 
percent, the industrial goods share was also high. The so-called 
Asian tigers (Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and 
Malaysia) have become interesting partners. They contributed 
only 2 percent to the total volume of Czech foreign trade, but 
the exchange of goods with these countries is growing fast. 
Imports increased by 38.9 percent and exports by 65.8 percent, 
in comparison with 1992. 
  Imports from the European states with transitional 
economies, 
excluding the former Soviet Union, increased by 4.6 percent, 
while exports declined by 11.9 percent. The trade surplus 
amounted to Kc8.5 billion. The largest trading partner in this 
group was Poland, with a 2.7-percent share of total foreign 
trade, and Hungary, with 1.7 percent. The Czech Republic mostly 
exported industrial goods to these countries (31 percent of 
total exports) and machines and vehicles (24.3 percent). 
Approximately 20 percent of total imports were mineral fuels, 
lubricants, and related products, industrial goods, machines, 
and vehicles. 
  The trade surplus achieved with states with the state trade 
system--the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Laos, China, 
Cuba, Vietnam, Mongolia--amounted to Kc6.3 billion. The volume 
of imports from these countries was 32.6 percent higher than in 
1992, and exports almost tripled. Dominant in imports were 
various finished products, with 50 percent of the total; in 
exports it was industrial goods, with 55.5 percent of the total, 
and machines and vehicles, with 43.8 percent. 
  Imports from the former Soviet Union steadily declined to 
80.1 percent of the 1992 volume. Exports remained approximately 
at the level of the preceding year. The trade deficit amounted 
to Kc19.8 billion. In the structure of imports, according to 
the category of goods, imports of mineral fuels, lubricants, and 
related products were dominant because crude oil and natural gas 
are in this category, which accounted for 71 percent of the 
total. The largest category of exported goods was machines and 
vehicles (45 percent). The same share of exports, approximately 
15 percent, was taken by food, livestock, and industrial goods. 
  In the structure of imports, according to categories of 
goods, the share of imports of mineral fuels, lubricants, and 
related products declined in 1993 in comparison with the 
preceding year by 3.1 percent to 12.4 percent of total imports. 
In 1993, 5.6 million tonnes of oil were imported (7 million 
tonnes in 1992) and 7 billion cubic meters (6.8 billion) of 
natural gas. The share of imported machines and vehicles also 
declined by 3.1 percent, to 38.4 percent. The share of imported 
finished products of all kinds increased by 2.7 percent to 12 
percent, industrial goods by 1.8 percent to 12.1 percent, and 
chemicals by 1.7 percent to 11.5 percent. 
  The structure of exports according to categories of goods 
was 
characterized in 1993, as compared with 1992, by the growing 
share of machines and vehicles (by 2.4 percent), which reached 
27.8 percent of total exports. On the other hand, the share of 
food and livestock declined by 2 percent to 6.1 percent. The 
export share of the most important category of goods, industrial 
products (at 31.9 percent of total exports), marginally declined.

<F P=106> [CTK report: "V. Dlouhy: Guarantees Are a Matter for the </F>
Banks and the Insurance Companies"] 
  [Text] Prague--Representatives of the major manufacturers 
agreed on yesterday's Debata [Debate] television program that 
large industrial projects cannot be implemented without state 
guarantees. Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said in 
response to this that commercial projects cannot be guaranteed 
by the state but, rather, on the basis of guarantee and 
insurance companies such as EGAP [Enterprise Guarantee and 
Insurance Program] or by the banks. 
  Skoda Plzen Director General Lubomir Soudek referred to the 
small number of Czech banks that are actually recognized 
throughout the world as guarantors. Dlouhy described the 
absence of bankruptcies as a negative influence on the Czech 
Republic's economy. He added, however, that certain structural 
changes are taking place in the enterprise sphere. National 
Property Fund Chairman T. Jezek said that some firms are indeed 
folding, but this happens more often by means of liquidation 
than by bankruptcy. Dlouhy also expressed himself in favor of a 
smaller percentage of industry in the Czech Republic's overall 
economy, a change in the structure of the industry sphere, and 
also greater efficiency in industrial output. In 1991, 
industrial output declined by 22 percent, compared with 1990. It 
declined by 10.6 percent in 1992, compared with 1991, and, last 
year, the industrial sector declined by 5 percent.

  [Text] Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, heading a 
Romanian government delegation, has begun a one-day official 
visit in Bratislava at the invitation of his Slovak counterpart 
Vladimir Meciar. At this hour the two delegations, headed by 
the Slovak and the Romanian prime ministers, are holding a first 
round of talks, our correspondent, Pavel Mocanu, reports. 
  Today at 1030, at the headquarters of Slovakia's Council of 
Ministers, the Romanian guests were received by Prime Minister 
Meciar, Jozef Prokes, deputy chairman of the Council of 
Ministers, and other members of the government. The agenda of 
the visit also includes meetings with Slovak President Michal 
Kovac and Parliament Speaker Ivan Gasparovic.

  [Excerpts] We have learned from well-informed circles that 
President of the Republic Michal Kovac has accepted the 
resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac. Although TA 
SR [News Agency of the Slovak Republic] has not issued this 
report yet, the secretariat of Roman Kovac confirmed it. 
Ludmila Bulakova interviews Roman Kovac: 
  [Bulakova] If someone is leaving office, it is appropriate 
to 
clear the desk. You can attempt symbolically to do something 
similar by clarifying some questions connected with your post as 
deputy prime minister. Many have been surprised by your 
rebelliousness--you have always been considered in general as a 
soft person who has been brought into the world of big politics 
by Vladimir Meciar. That is why some hold it against you that 
you publicly stood up against his line. Such practice is 
foreign to advanced democracies. [passage omitted] What was the 
famous last straw that broke the camel's back? 
  [Kovac] I think it was the meeting with the deputies (in 
Plachtincie) where it was quite clear that we had slowly lost 
the ability to persuade people about the strengths of our 
policy. [passage indistinct] 
  [Bulakova] I will revert to your open stand against the 
official line of the prime minister because your former party 
colleague and former ambassador to Austria, Rudolf Filkus, also 
began by criticizing the government policy as an official party 
representative. That met, at that time, with a controversial 
assessment, not only in the camp of the commentators but also 
among politicians. It is not a habit in the European countries, 
which we would like to join, for an official representative of 
the government to criticize its policy. Resignation first and 
then criticism is considered a better way. You, despite the 
aforementioned experience with Rudolf Filkus, chose the opposite 
direction. Why? 
  [Kovac] I should like to correct this. My stand did not 
result in any fundamental criticism of the work of the 
government. I criticized the political situation into which the 
government had gotten--that is the crisis in parliament or 
simply the will of the parliament to pass important bills--that 
is the cooperation of the parties, or possible cooperation of 
political entities proved untenable. And, together with the 
deputies, we proposed a certain solution that, I admit, was a 
very untraditional solution but could have calmed the political 
situation temporarily. I indeed thought it would create a 
government of experts, which would have bridged a certain period 
up to the early elections. The early elections would have 
cleared the political scene. This proposal could have been 
reasonable from Slovakia's point of view, not from the viewpoint 
of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], not from the 
point of view of the existing government, but from the point of 
view of Slovakia. 
  [Bulakova] The prime minister says about you that you have 
betrayed not only him but also the movement by having 
discussions behind his back not only with the opposition 
political parties but also with the president. There even was a 
rumor that you were a candidate for the future prime minister of 
the temporary government. 
  [Kovac] I have stressed many times that the proposal we came 
up with was not a traditional one, and, naturally, it had to be 
discussed. In fact, we discussed it within the official 
boundaries of the parliamentary deputy group. If you speak 
about the possibility of treason and the possibility of the 
deputies who were or are dissatisfied with the situation in our 
country, even the deputies who are in the movement, one has to 
stress two points: One point is when the deputy deviates from 
his election program, and the second is when the election 
program is not fulfilled. [passage omitted] 
  A new political entity should bring new principles into 
political work and be open-ended, which means that its fate 
depends on further talks, which appear very promising indeed, 
with other political entities, and the aim should be setting up 
a strong center bloc because I think that, in this transitory 
stage, center politics could lead towards success. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Satellite interview with Petar Sarcevic, Croatian </F>
ambassador to the United States, in Washington, by Jon Snow in 
London -- live] 
  [Text] [Snow] Ambassador, why, given the appalling things 
that have happened between yours and Muslim communities over the 
last few months, should we have any faith that the new deal 
signed between Croats and Muslims can actually work on the 
ground? 
  [Sarcevic] Let me first actually say I would not consider 
myself a key figure in the deal. I was just one of those that 
helped, but the key figures were different. I would say that a 
key figure on the Croatian side was Minister Granic, and of 
course, President Tudjman. And it was a very crucial role of 
Ambassador Redman, and of course, the host State Department and 
Secretary Christopher on one side, Premier Silajdzic on the 
other side, and also the representatives of the Croatians from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mr. Zubak and (?Atmatic). 
  [Snow] And you were doing your bit, ambassador? 
  [Sarcevic] I was also there, yes, and I was part of the 
process, but as I said, I have to clarify that. 
  [Snow] Now why should it work? Because, I mean, relations on 
the ground are still dreadful. 
  [Sarcevic] Yes, and this is nothing new in these kinds of 
cases. It was possible to stop fighting previously in other 
parts of the world, so why should we not stop fighting in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina among Croats and Muslims? And so, I am 
really not pessimistic; I really feel that there is such a 
chance and more than a chance. The atmosphere in which we 
negotiated was very friendly, was toward a peaceful settlement, 
and that made it possible. 
  [Snow] Well now, do you have an agreed position between you 
as to what should happen with the Bosnian Serbs? 
  [Sarcevic] You already heard the various statements made by 
Secretary Christopher and Premier Silajdzic that this agreement 
is open also to the Serbs. This agreement is making no actual 
changes on the framework of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state. That 
means the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina stays as it was, as an 
internationally-recognized state, and this agreement of a 
federation of Croats and Muslims will mean only that they have 
found a way to administer and to manage their living together. 
  [Snow] But you see, the stumbling block with Lord Owen has 
always been the maps and has been what should happen on the 
ground. Does this agreement mean that you foresee a situation 
which maybe the Serbs would join in a process in which you all 
agreed to leave everything as it is for how long? 
  [Sarcevic] No, we will settle our...[pauses] as I 
understand, 
the Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Muslims from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will actually settle issues among them which 
where, until now, crucial for a peaceful settlement and peaceful 
living together. So from that point view, I see no problems. 
  [Snow] That is where it gets so difficult for us to 
understand how you can progress from this point? 
  [Sarcevic] Well, you have to start from somewhere. You know, 
it has proved to be very difficult to bring all three parties to 
a kind of state of mind where they are accepting the idea that 
it is necessary to negotiate a peaceful settlement. 
  [Snow] Do Lord Owen and the maps come into play again? 
  [Sarcevic] No, because we will settle the various issues 
between Croats and Muslims. Now the question is, what will be 
the position of Serbs in regard to territories they occupied or 
where they clashed with the Muslim population or the Croatian 
population? And this will then be discussed when they come into 
play, but they have to be aware that Bosnia-Herzegovina as a 
state still exists and that Croats and Muslims will live 
together peacefully, and if they want to stop the aggression 
that will be something they will have to decide. They will have 
to understand the international community is not willing to 
accept this kind of behavior any longer. 
  [Snow] Finally, ambassador, in a word, when do you think you 
might see the Serbs at the table? 
  [Sarcevic] We were not talking about that. This was not the 
aim of this negotiation. Our aim was to find a way of settling 
various issues among Bosnian Croats and.... 
  [Snow, interrupting] But that is the critical thing, is it 
not? Getting them now to respond to what you have done? 
  [Sarcevic] Yes and no, because this is something we have to 
settle among ourselves, and that is what we did. Now, whether 
they want to join, whether they want to negotiate a civil kind 
of living together, that is something they will have to decide, 
and they are invited to do so. 
  [Snow] Ambassador, thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Statement by Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic in New </F>
York on 2 March after meeting UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali; in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian 
translation -- recorded] 
  [Text] This is the first step. We will get on with our 
work. We will continue negotiations on a final agreement in 
Vienna and try to finish our work by 15 March. We have signed a 
preliminary agreement on the Croat-Muslim federation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and on the confederation between 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. It will be a very strong union. 
An agreement on the economy, currency, customs, and other 
issues has been concluded. 
  As for the UN Protected Areas [UNPA's] in Croatia, we are 
expecting a very active mandate on the part of the UN Protection 
Force in the forthcoming period, especially with regard to the 
Croatian borders, disarmament, the establishment of 
communications, and the peaceful reintegration of UNPAs in 
Croatia's legal system. We are ready for talks with local Serbs 
about local autonomy and we are ready for international 
supervision, by the United Nations, the Council of Europe, and 
European Union observers, over human rights, especially the 
rights of the minorities in Croatia. 
  As for the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, we largely 
support NATO's actions so far and we will continue with the 
talks. Croats and Muslims will continue negotiations with the 
Serbs in order that the Serbs can either join the federation or 
that some other agreement can be reached with them.

  [Excerpt] Following last night's signing of an agreement 
with Bosnian Prime Minister Silajdzic, Croatian Foreign Minister 
Dr. Mate Granic this afternoon had talks with UN officials -- UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and Jean Bernard Merimee, French 
ambassador and president of the UN Security Council. Here is 
Jozo Curic with a report from New York: 
  [Curic] Croatia is ready to continue peaceful dialogue with 
the Serbs in UNPA's [UN Protected Areas] areas, Minister Granic 
told UN Secretary General Ghali and UN Security Council 
President Merimee in New York today. He mentioned the principle 
of local autonomy in those UNPA's where Serbs were in the 
majority before the war. Croatia wants the issue of the occupied 
areas to be resolved in line with UN Resolution 871. The UNPA's 
are an integral part of Croatia, Dr. Granic said. 
  According to some UN sources Croatia will ask for a more 
active UNPROFOR mandate, including the use of ultimatum. This 
would mean the implementation of the resolutions that provide 
for the control of borders, for disarmament, the control of 
roads, measures to restore confidence, and the economic recovery 
of these areas. Minister Granic informed his hosts about the 
Croat-Muslim outline agreement on a federation and the 
preliminary agreement on a loose confederation of Croatia and 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Knin, 3 March (TANJUG) -- Slobodan Jarcevic, 
minister of foreign affairs of the republic of Serb Krajina, 
told TANJUG today he "believed that aircraft that were downed 
above Bosnia were sent by Croatian Government and the Croatian 
Army leadership." 
  Jarcevic said that Croats and Muslims were for months 
fighting in central Bosnia and that the Croatian forces 
continuously bombarded Muslim positions. 
  "Therefore, the aircraft were most probably Croatian, 
because 
the Serbs do not fight there," Jarcevic added stressing that the 
aircraft were downed above the area of the Croat-Muslim 
conflicts.

join this program as the first country that is not a member of 
the NATO Cooperation Council. Edo Zitnik has the details: 
  [Begin Zitnik recording] The NATO pact has now also 
officially offered cooperation in the Partnership for Peace to 
Slovenia as the 11th East European country. [passage omitted] 
  Because each country signs the Partnership for Peace with 
NATO individually, its concrete contents will depend greatly on 
the Slovene offers for cooperation. We must keep in mind that 
Slovenia is not among the first in the Partnership and that 
other countries, because of their greater strategic importance, 
have already taken the best that NATO has offered. [passage

  [Text] Our Foreign Ministry accompanied a decision about 
Slovenia's participation in the Partnership for Peace with a 
special statement: 
  In the introduction, the statement mentions a letter that 
Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle sent to the foreign ministers of 
its member-states prior to the 5 February NATO summit, a visit 
by the U.S. President's special envoy Madeleine Albright to 
Slovenia, and a letter that our Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek 
sent to [NATO] prime ministers together with a formal 
application for the participation of our country in the 
Partnership for Peace. 
  The Foreign Ministry emphasizes that, by being admitted into 
the Partnership for Peace, Slovenia has accomplished an 
important step in drawing closer to the Western European 
integrations, also in the realm of security. Today's decision 
of the NATO Council in Brussels represents a materialization of 
the efforts of our state organs in the implementation of the 
Resolution on Guidelines of the National Security Concept, which 
was passed by the Slovene Parliament in February. 
  We are supposed to sign a cooperation document in the coming 
days. After the talks with the NATO political and military 
experts, our country will get another opportunity to appoint its 
military and political representatives to NATO Headquarters in 
Brussels, is written in a statement by the Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] Ljubljana, Mar 2 (TANJUG) -- Slovenia's Foreign 
Ministry on Wednesday sent a protest note to Croatia because of 
the resumption of construction works on Croatia's border 
crossing in the vicinity of the Slovenian resort of Portoroz. 
  Slovenian authorities maintain that Croatia's customs 
authorities are constructing facilities on Slovenia's territory 
and demand that the works be discontinued until the final 
demarcation in area. 
  The construction works were discontinued in May last year 
after strong protests by Slovenia. Croatia, however, decided to 
resume construction works which is expected to cause further 
straining of Slovenian-Croatian relations which have already 
deteriorated as a result of disputes over land and maritime 
borders and electric power deliveries from the Krsko nuclear 
power plant. 
  Inhabitants of the Kantrida settlement in the Croatian port 
of Rijeka in [word indistinct] particular way expressed 
dissatisfaction with Slovenia's policy towards Croatia and the 
deteriorating relations between Ljubljana and Zagreb. 
  On a number of ocassions they threw stones at trains on the 
Rijeka-Ljubljana line, the Rijeka police said. 
  In the exchange of diplomatic letter between Croatia and 
Slovenia concerning the incident, the Croatian side promised, as 
it was underscored, that it will "prevent vandal actions of its 
citizens."

  [Text] Skopje, March 3 (AFP) -- The rump Yugoslavia has cut 
off its air space to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM], the Macedonian transport ministry said 
Thursday. There was no immediate confirmation from Belgrade. 
The Macedonian press Thursday said unpaid debts by Macedonian 
airlines had risen to 2.5 million dollars. 
  The measure would mean another hardship for Macedonia, which 
is already suffering under a controversial trade embargo imposed 
last month by Greece in a dispute over Macedonia's name. The 
Greek embargo effectively cut off Macedonia's oil supplies. 
  Vanja Bitoljanu, director of Macedonia's biggest airline 
company Paler Makedonija, told AFP there was no way for airlines 
to pay their debts to Yugoslavia since there was no transport 
agreement between the two former members of the old Yugoslav 
federation. 
  Rump Yugoslavia, which now consists of Serbia and 
Montenegro, 
has not recognized Macdonian independence, which was declared in 
1991. 
  Air traffic taking off from Macedonia has been rerouted over 
Bulgaria and Romania, which adds an average 30 minutes to 
flights and increases the cost by some 2,500 dollars each time, 
the press reports said. 
  Bitoljanu also said that for the last two years only 
Yugoslavia was receiving payments of taxes for the 300 to 400 
yearly overflights airlines make over Yugoslavia and Macedonia 
en route to Greece. 
  Analysts cited Thursday by the daily NOVA MAKEDONIJA 
suggested there was a link between the reported ban on 
Macedonian flights over Yugoslavia and the trade embargo imposed 
by Greece, a traditional ally of Serbia. 
  Greece has challenged Macedonia's use of its name, the same 
as a Greek province. It accuses Skopje of usurping part of 
Greek heritage and harboring expanionist aims over Greek 
territory. Its trade embargo cut off Macedonian access to the 
Greek port of Salonika, though which most of Macedonia's 
essential supplies including oil arrive. A prolonged blockade 
could strangle Macedonia's economy. 
  NOVA MAKEDONIJA also said the European Union had agreed to a 
15 million-dollar credit for Macedonia to finance the 
development of its air transport system. Britain meanwhile has 
granted 50,000 pounds (75,000 dollars) to modernize Skopje's 
airport.

<F P=106> [Interview with Marek Markiewicz, former chairman and </F>
current member of the National Radio and Television Broadcasting 
Council, by Beata Modrzejewska; place and date not given: 
"Something Else Is Bound To Happen"] 
  [Text] [Modrzejewska] How did you find out about your 
dismissal from the post of chairman of the National Radio and 
Television Broadcasting Council [KRRiT]? 
  [Markiewicz] An employee of the KRRiT's Office called me on 
the telephone saying that a letter in an open envelope has been 
brought into the secretariate; he read the letter to me and that 
is how I found out about the dismissal. 
  [Modrzejewska] Have you received signals from the Belvedere 
before, to the effect that it is the president's intention to 
dismiss you? [KRRiT member] Ryszard Bender paid a visit to 
[presidential aide] Minister Drzycimski that morning. 
  [Markiewicz] He did not tell us about his visit until the 
afternoon. 
  [Modrzejewska] Do you expect further moves by the president, 
such as for instance dismissal of other KRRiT members who were 
appointed by him? 
  [Markiewicz] That cannot be ruled out. There is a lot of 
determination on this issue. KRRiT is not demonstrating any 
signs of initiating a dispute or of putting the president's 
decisions in question, but on the other hand, the statement made 
by the president yesterday morning indicates that something else 
is bound to happen. 
  [Modrzejewska] During Tuesday's [1 March] press conference, 
you initiated an argument with the president in a decisive 
manner for the first time, by summarizing a telephone 
conversation during which the president had accused you of 
having accepted a bribe. 
  [Markiewicz] I have always been an enthusiast of the 
president. I have never wanted a fight with him and not a 
single aggressive phrase was ever spoken by me with regard to 
him. The accusation that was made, was terrible for me, but the 
contents of the conversation with the president would have 
remained my secret, if it had not been for the fact that the 
accusation also appeared in an open letter to the president by 
Jan Purzycki--that letter has not been denied. I could have 
assumed that there will be someone to say that I am stupid or 
incompetent, but to say that I am a thief? Regardless of what 
one can think of me as a person, the letter concerned an 
institution, that is KRRiT. Once someone starts accusing state 
institutions of something that has not been proven, then one can 
expect that other institutions will at least distance themselves 
from the accusation. I was very curious to see what the 
president's reaction will be. 
  [Modrzejewska] So in your view, what should have been the 
president's reaction after he received the letter? 
  [Markiewicz] He could have said that it does not look good 
in public when such things are being said publicly about a 
constitutional organ, regardless of what the organ really did or 
did not do, since such accusations weaken the position of these 
institutions, not the position of the individual persons; 
privately, I do not have to be concerned with such letters. 
  [Modrzejewska] Why do you not defend yourself by suing 
Purzycki in a court of law? 
  [Markiewicz] By myself, I am the smallest element--I mean 
nothing. The issue offended me very much and I do not rule out 
the possibility of seeking court action, but I want to say that 
dealing with courts is not one of my life passions. I know I 
had not taken any bribe. To try to contradict that, would mean 
caring not for oneself, but avoiding a spiral of publicity 
without any contradiction whatsoever, since that sets in motion 
a phenomenon in public life, which will kill us all. 
  [Modrzejewska] Do you see the president's moves as made with 
the future presidential elections in mind? 
  [Markiewicz] That is hard to assess. Everybody is aware of 
the upcoming elections and of the increasing destabilization and 
aggressiveness of Polish political life; I think it is not 
possible to ignore this, even if one is not aware of all that. 
  [Modrzejewska] Was the president's dissatisfaction with the 
granting of a license to PolSat caused by the fact that he had 
had his own favorite candidate? 
  [Markiewicz] Even if he did, I know nothing about it. But 
[PolSat owner] Solorz is not particularly in our good books for 
any specific reason; in making the decision we did, we tried to 
act in an objective manner. I pointed out during a radio 
conversation with [presidential aide] Professor Falandysz, that 
it is wrong to make the accusation that PolSat will have a 
monopoly since it received an all-national license; it would be 
close to impossible to grant PolSat half a concession or a 
quarter of it, whereas KRRiT had received a written motion 
concerning PolSat's withdrawal of its applications for local 
stations. 
  [Modrzejewska] Why did the president dismiss you exactly 
on the first anniversary of KRRiT's term of office? 
  [Markiewicz] Perhaps it had to do with some symbolic 
meaning, or perhaps with the granting of a license to PolSat? I 
do not want to go into the issue of human intentions; I always 
make the assumption that they are good, and that good intentions 
are the basis even of violent gestures. This is my approach to 
people, and in particular to Lech Walesa. 
  [Modrzejewska] So let us assume the president's intentions 
were indeed good. He says you committed a flagrant violation of 
the statute. Do you agree with the accusation? 
  [Markiewicz] I do not, but that is not an issue of 
intentions but one of the effects of how the statute, the limits 
of its functioning, and the basis for evaluating KRRiT's 
activity have been presented to the president. I have wanted 
many times to talk to the president concerning, among other 
things, what KKRiT is supposed to be doing based on the statute, 
and how it is supposed to function. I became aware of why such 
a conversation never took place when I found out that the 
president had thought that we were just supposed to perform some 
organizational work, and that we were to be replaced by others. 
I did not belong to a group of people who could present their 
views to the president--I acted like a clerk and that may be 
part of the assessment of the situation we are in. 
  [Modrzejewska] Accusations have been made that PolSat had 
not been adequately verified by KRRiT or that Zygmunt Solorz's 
credibility was not checked. 
  [Markiewicz] We have always expected other state organs to 
cooperate. We did everything in our power to verify PolSat's 
application. Other state organs failed to point out to us what 
they should have done, within their range of powers, to guard 
the country's interests. 
  [Modrzejewska] The Office of State Protection [UOP] says it 
pointed out some doubts but KRRiT did not request any further 
information. 
  [Markiewicz] UOP presented two documents to us but there are 
no reasons whatsoever for an institution which has the 
appropriate documents, to disclose them publicly. We are bound 
by rules of state secrecy. Once the duty is lifted from us, we 
will then reveal to the public all the documents we have. 
  [Modrzejewska] Was KRRiT not interested in press 
enunciations concerning PolSat and its owner? 
  [Markiewicz] Of course we were interested. We made personal 
guarantees, by signing the license over to PolSat. Every 
circumstance described by the press was examined. 
  [Modrzejewska] You stated publicly that Zygmunt Solorz had 
replied to every accusation. Do you mean he just answered, or 
did he present appropriate documentation? 
  [Markiewicz] He either answered, or presented documents--if 
the circumstances warranted that. After a few conversations 
with Solorz, I am increasingly convinced that the decision was 
right. Along with my colleagues from KRRiT, we imagined a 
scenario of someone else getting the license, and we simulated 
possible types of attack, and in our view, these attacks would 
have been rather similar with regard to anyone else who would 
receive the license. The press accused PolSat of having signed 
an agreement with Murdoch, but the press never published 
anything when the accusation turned out to be untrue; it was the 
same case with the accusation that Solorz has German citizenship. 
  [Modrzejewska] That was in the files. 
  [Markiewicz] Yes, it was, but one will have to prove that 
Solorz used to be a German citizen. 
  [Modrzejewska] Did Solorz increase PolSat's capital as he 
had promised? 
  [Markiewicz] Sure he did. The license describes subsequent 
stages of setting the share capital in motion, and if he fails 
to implement that, then that will be a reason for taking the 
license away from him. 
  [Modrzejewska] Was KRRiT not bothered by the many passports 
of Zygmunt Solorz? 
  [Markiewicz] It has never been proven that he has used them 
simultaneously. Mr. Solorz himself explained to us the issue of 
the passports, and these explanations are included in our files. 
In any event, that theme has never been brought up by state 
agencies. 
  [Modrzejewska] Is there any truth to rumors that you intend 
to run in the presidential elections? 
  [Markiewicz] When I heard this, I began wondering who could 
be wanting to hurt me by saying such things under the current 
situation. 
  [Modrzejewska] So do you intend to run, or not? 
  [Markiewicz] That scenario was not included in my thinking 
about the future. The work at the KRRiT defines the range of my 
aspirations or expectations. 
  [Modrzejewska] Is it possible that you will give up your 
membership in KRRiT? 
  [Markiewicz] In the spring, KRRiT will submit its report to 
the parliament, concerning its year-long activity. I have never 
made it a secret that it is my intention to make efforts for the 
KRRiT to present its report.

<F P=106> [Article by Eliza Olczyk: "Aim--Second Term of Office; </F>
President in Action"] 
  [Text] "I wanted to, but they would not let me"--this is 
one of Lech Walesa's favorite sayings. He wanted to give each 
citizen 100 million zlotys, but nothing happened. He wanted to 
leave only socks on affair mongers, but he did not manage to do 
that, either. Recently, he has wanted to give people the right 
to submit their own draft constitutions, but the Sejm rejected 
his initiative in the first reading. It is also not clear how 
the issue of the recall of Marek Markiewicz will end up. 
<H5>  Movement in the Business </H5>
  Lech Walesa feels bad when nothing is happening in politics. 
He likes to see some movement in the business. However, since 
the dissolution of the parliament last year, he has not had many 
occasions to really act. He kept the government coalition in 
suspense for a while, wondering whether he should appoint 
Waldemar Pawlak to the post of prime minister. He teased the 
politicians for a little while by demanding three candidates, 
but that was all. 
  Only the National Council of Radio and Television [KRRiT] 
gave him more reasons to act: It appointed Wieslaw Walendziak to 
the position of president of the Polish Television. Following 
the decision, the president withdrew political support for the 
members of the council whom he had himself appointed; he waited 
for them to submit their resignations, which did not happen. 
  He provoked the next confrontation himself by submitting the 
bill of the so-called people's initiative; because of that, the 
Sejm divided into supporters and opponents of the president, 
which livened up the usually boring plenary debates. The 
rejection of the bill was instantly taken advantage of by the 
president, who withdrew from the work on the Constitution. 
  Before the public opinion forgot the issue of the 
Constitution, the president recalled Marek Markiewicz from the 
post of KRRiT chairman and queried the decision granting a 
nationwide television license to Zygmunt Solorz. 
<H5>  What Does the President Want To Achieve? </H5>
  The politicians whom we asked about it unanimously answered 
that he wants to gain the post of president for another five 
years. The thing is, he is doing it rather unskillfully. 
  "It is clear to me that the president is making 
uncoordinated 
movements. By withdrawing from the work on the Constitution, he 
wanted to make a political gain; however, there is no one that 
could do that with him," says Ryszard Bugaj of the Labor Union. 
  Bugaj believes that the recall of Marek Markiewicz from the 
post of KRRiT chairman is an element in the fight for influence 
on the mass media. It is also possible that the issue of 
Zygmunt Solorz, owner of PolSat and a license for nationwide 
television, is supposed to be the implementation of the slogan: 
I will leave only socks on affair-mongers. 
  At any rate, the president, who has always acted 
chaotically, 
has now really gotten lost. Contrary to the law, he refused to 
participate in the work on the Constitution. It is not known 
whether the decision on the recall of Markiewicz was legal as 
well. Such inappropriate activities only show his political 
helplessness and the incompetence of his entourage. 
  "The game that he is involved in is drawing him increasingly 
deeper," says Bugaj. "In addition, detrimental to his opinion 
are such things as the repair of the Namiestnikowski Palace and 
buying expensive cars for his family members. He is waging his 
campaign clumsily." 
  Andrzej Potocki of the Democratic Union entirely shares 
Bugaj's opinion. 
  He believes that the president's activities will not endear 
him to many voters. Some of his decisions cannot be accepted 
even by those who support him. As a result of his actions, soon 
in Poland there may be no issue that would not be entangled in 
politics. KRRiT activities should be excluded from political 
gamesmanship; however, Walesa encroaches on the area of the 
political independence of KRRiT in order to subordinate the mass 
media to himself. 
<H5>  A Man of Action </H5>
  "The president is a man of fight and action," says Zbigniew 
Siemiatkowski of the Democratic Left Alliance. "He does not 
like a stable democracy. His experience suggests that he always 
benefits from direct confrontations, and that is why he is 
seeking them." 
  According to Siemiatkowski, the president's entourage does 
not fully understand that, in a democracy, everyone is submitted 
to certain specified rules of the game. The parliament does not 
have the duty to adopt a bill only because it has been submitted 
by the president--all the more so because Walesa did not make 
any efforts to create a favorable atmosphere around his bill. 
The same goes for KRRiT. Respect for the president is not the 
same as absolute obedience to him. The council's 
representatives, who have been appointed by the president, 
attempted to act much too independently. This attempt 
encountered resistance and resulted in the recall of Markiewicz 
from the post of chairman. 
  All of this is an element of a political campaign because 
only through criticism can one gain the disgruntled. 
<H5>  Information Noise </H5>
  According to Janusz Piechocinski of the Polish Peasant 
Party, 
the president is trying to show that he is active on the 
political scene and has a lot to offer. He is employing his 
favorite tactics: He attacks, usually before leaving somewhere, 
and waits to see what positions the pawns on the political 
chessboard will take. 
  "The situation of the president is difficult," says 
Piechocinski. "At the moment, he has no political friends. 
Apart from that, he is asking himself the question of whether 
he can get rid of political duties or whether he must 
participate in this game and for the second time run for the 
position of the head of state." 
  Piechocinski believes that the president's activities are 
not 
easy to interpret. It is not clear whether the president is 
against KRRiT or against the division of the mass media, which 
has been made by the council. Perhaps he is concerned about the 
fact that the mass media are getting away from his control. All 
this is not entirely clear. 
  "Walesa does not have a large combat scenario," says 
Piechocinski. "Actually, he has never had it. The aim of his 
activities is another term as president; however, so far he has 
been making merely information noise and giving the impression 
of total instability of the political world." 
  Only Leszek Moczulski of the Confederation for an 
Independent 
Poland believes that the purpose of Lech Walesa's actions is 
first of all the strengthening of the position of the president 
in the political life. He wants to exert greater influence on 
what is happening in the country. Political activeness, however 
ineffective, is better than lack of activeness. Inaction 
disqualifies a politician.
