<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Hall, Polish Conservative Party </F>
chairman, by correspondent Wanda Jurczak; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Jurczak] Why do you consistently pass such an 
emphatically negative judgment on the government coalition camp 
in your public utterances? 
  [Hall] First, it is more than obvious that the government 
coalition has no cohesive program of state reforms. What they 
do is neither continuation of the work of their predecessors nor 
its demolition. On the other hand, in such areas as, say, 
reforms of the health service and the budget-funded sector, we 
can expect continuing stagnation. It is obvious that the 
process of privatization is already being hampered in its 
progress. Nor do I believe that the present government 
coalition is capable of successfully resisting public pressure. 
In contrast to this, we know that both Leszek Balcerowicz and 
Hanna Suchocka's entire government were perfectly able to take 
risks for the sake of certain overriding interests and were even 
prepared to enter into conflict with a substantial proportion of 
the general public for the sake of these interests. Today we 
cannot find any evidence of such firm principles. Finally, 
there is a clearly discernible return to the policy of making 
politically inspired appointments to key state offices. Such 
appointments are often entrusted to people who were politically 
active in the past, although not always in association with the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] or the Polish Peasant Party 
[PSL]. The government coalition promotes a vision of a strongly 
centralized state, with a powerful central administration. The 
way to counteract such ambitions is to give significant powers 
to local self-government structures and regional communities. 
This is our concept of running things. 
  [Jurczak] But the president has expressed a strongly 
negative opinion of the political configuration existing outside 
the government coalition. 
  [Hall] In my view, the president should refrain from using 
such strong expressions which are loaded with negative messages. 
On the other hand, it is true that very many politicians from 
the post-Solidarity camp have failed to pass the test as 
statesmen and leaders of the nation. I do not know whether the 
president was referring also to me in his utterance. I hope he 
was not. 
  [Jurczak] To go back to your own patch, do you believe that 
Kazimierz Michal Ujazdowski was right when he accused you of 
attempting to cause a split in your party? 
  [Hall] We are now well and truly "divorced," and a group of 
our former colleagues, including Mr. Ujazdowski, have left the 
Conservative Party. In any case, they are not a particularly 
large group, and in the past they demonstrated considerable 
political talent when they were setting up our party. Mr. 
Ujazdowski's future plans are precise and clear-cut: He intends 
to set up a compound political party together with the Christian 
National Union [ZChN], the Center Alliance [PC], and the 
PSL-Peasant Alliance. It is his God-given right to do so. We, 
on the other hand, intend to continue investing in the 
Conservative Party and a future conservative-liberal camp which 
should eventually be created in Poland. 
  [Jurczak] Has your party worked out a strategy that could 
help you achieve success in the forthcoming local 
self-government elections? 
  [Hall] We operate within the framework of an agreement 
between different political programs, dubbed the 11 November 
Agreement, but in the local self-government elections our 
structures will retain considerable freedom of maneuver as 
regards selection of political allies--excluding, of course, the 
ruling government coalition and Union of Labor. In order to be 
able to create wide-ranging political alliances, we should 
ideally set up alliance structures in every city, each embracing 
a spectrum of parties from the Democratic Union through the 
ZChN. This is because we will have a very strong adversary on 
the other side, namely the SLD in urban centers and the PSL in 
the rural sector. This challenge will oblige us to concentrate 
our forces. That will not be possible everywhere, but I believe 
that such a tactic will be most desirable. Moreover, I believe 
that it is improper practice to change the electoral law at 
short notice before the elections; I believe that the local 
self-government elections should be conducted on the base of the 
old electoral law, which is, in any case, still in force today. 
  [Jurczak] Thank you for talking to us.

<F P=106> [Interview with Adam Tanski, chairman of the State Treasury </F>
Agricultural Property Agency, by correspondent Halina Zielinska; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Zielinska] Mr. Chairman, it is now two years 
since your agency was set up, and we still cannot see even the 
beginning of the end--that is, the end of the process of the 
privatization of Polish agriculture. Why is your progress so 
poor in that area? 
  [Tanski] I must say I disagree with you completely. Our 
progress is by no means "poor," but actually quite good. You 
must take into account that it has not been "all of two years" 
but "only two years," which, in practice, has meant 18 months of 
our activity in a fully developed structure. During that time, 
we managed to take over the assets of all of the state farms and 
more than 40 percent of the assets at the disposal of the State 
Land Fund. And we began in extremely difficult circumstances, 
with only a small group of dedicated enthusiasts committed to 
the idea of the future transformations and resistant to all 
attacks and accusations.... 
  [Zielinska] What attacks? What accusations? 
  [Tanski] Well, all kinds of interests happen to come into 
conflict with one another as a result of the new privatization 
schemes. Previous employees of the state farms [PGR] currently 
under privatization often dream of getting the land for 
themselves. Now and again you still come across the slogan 
"Share out the land!," which was invoked, most irresponsibly, in 
my opinion, by people who at the time controlled the state's 
agricultural policy. 
  Former PGR directors cherish different expectations than 
either local farmers or self-government structures, which in 
their turn view the privatization process in the light of their 
parishes' interests. However we look at it, these interests are 
often in conflict with one another as well as with the interests 
of the state treasury, to which the land belongs. 
  [Zielinska] You can often hear the view that it is quite 
hard to find buyers ready to purchase reprivatized land. 
Especially in the northeast of Poland, where whole fields are 
often to be found lying fallow. 
  [Tanski] It is true that situations do happen when land is 
left fallow during the period when, say, the privatization 
process is under way, when the old owner is gone and we have not 
yet managed to find his successor. But it also happens--quite 
often, too--that instances of land left to waste are the result 
of the agricultural policy inherited from the time when the PGR 
farm acreage statistics were artificially increased by the 
addition of grade V and grade VI land to the records, even if 
production on those sites was too expensive and unprofitable 
because of low soil quality. The market economy principles 
currently obtaining have naturally verified the land grading 
system, and I believe that this process is healthy and natural. 
  [Zielinska] Another irritating development is that land sale 
auctions are inevitably won by local setups or interest 
groups.... 
  [Tanski] The auction operations are merely the end element 
of the whole process because a long process has to take place 
before land is put up for sale by auction: It must be assessed, 
valued, and restructured according to a program drafted by our 
experts. This is in order to prepare healthy farms, free from 
excess poor quality land, capable of high production and able to 
function in the free market situation. And all of our auctions 
are organized in a way that precludes the possibility of 
corruption. Each is mandatorily attended by a notary official 
who collects the tenders, and by a director from our own agency; 
all decisions are made by an auction commission. 
  You voiced an objection to "local setups." But these are 
fine as long as they are groups of local people who have 
sufficient financial credibility, with a leading shareholder, 
and a good chance of attracting external finance. Why should we 
object to them? 
  On the other hand, it is true that sometimes interested 
local 
groups attempt to bend the rules to serve their own interests by 
proclaiming loudly that they are entitled to the land they want 
because they had been attached to it. 
  [Zielinska] Are you talking about Andrzej Lepper? 
  [Tanski] Not only him. In my opinion, in Lepper's case the 
aim was to take advantage of the fabricated conflict for 
political reasons. When we comment widely on such developments, 
we play into the hands of people who are only too keen to figure 
in front page news. 
  Such incidents have taken place several times already, 
although they were not particularly highlighted by the press. 
For example, we came across such a campaign in Lysomice near 
Torun, when our office was forcibly occupied and we were forced 
to ask the police to intervene. This sort of action amounts to 
a breach of the law, and it should be unequivocally condemned, 
with all of the attendant consequences. And nothing more need 
be said about it. 
  [Zielinska] What are your relations with the Polish Peasant 
Party [PSL] and the Pawlak government? 
  [Tanski] During the past few months, we encountered no 
particular problems associated with the fact that a government 
coalition had assumed power. We do not need to convince anyone 
that privatization of the agricultural sector will bring 
immediate and tangible effects. We have only those problems to 
contend with, with which we had already grappled before. 
  [Zielinska] Does the PSL or the coalition government not 
want to post their own men within your Agency? 
  [Tanski] That would be a secondary concern. For the time 
being, as you see, I persist in my office, I function 
adequately, and I do not believe I look despondent at all. Of 
course, as any other high state official, I must be prepared for 
the possibility that I might be recalled one day, but I do not 
believe that this must not make any difference to the quality of 
my work in the present office: It should never bear the stamp 
of a "temporary job." 
  [Zielinska] You mentioned certain problems. 
  [Tanski] Yes. Our worst problem at the moment is the 
question of PGR debts. Let me remind you that we take over the 
PGR's, which are under liquidation, which means inheriting all 
of their assets as well as their debt liabilities. 
Unfortunately, the latter are quite massive: We estimate that 
they reach 20 trillion zlotys [Z]. Furthermore, you must 
remember that our creditors are institutions that must not be 
allowed to collapse because that would hurt the agricultural 
sector too much. Consequently, we seek a compromise that could 
be reached by instituting talks with the banks on the terms of a 
possible settlement, which would give a chance to both sides. 
  Our second problem is the need to find credible customers 
willing to buy or rent the privatized properties. Here we are 
only partly successful because the lack of free capital in 
Poland presents a serious obstacle in this area. That is why we 
welcome engagement of foreign capital. 
  The last problem is unemployment. Previously, this was 
hidden because PGR structures made it possible to conceal it, 
but the present transformations have uncovered and highlighted 
it very plainly. The phenomenon is particularly troublesome 
because it is concentrated in Poland's northern and western 
regions, where almost half of our farms are situated. People 
who live there have no alternative employment opportunities, 
while we, unfortunately, are unable to create so-called 
individual family farms, whose size would be limited to 20-30 
hectares. Nevertheless, we are doing our best to activate for 
that purpose certain currently "underused" credit lines, which 
had been granted to us by the World Bank. We also intend to try 
to activate production in those farms that we have "liberated" 
from their debt liabilities after taking them over. We believe 
that it is possible to acquire finance for that purpose from the 
Labor Fund. We also expect that the government will take 
appropriate steps to assist us in the funding of our operations. 
Otherwise, the employees of our farms will end up as clients of 
employment offices, applying for money that ultimately comes 
from the same source but that would then be handed to them in 
the form of unemployment benefits.

<F P=106> [Interview with Leszek Miller, labor and social policy </F>
minister, by Andrzej Bober and Jerzy Baczynski in Warsaw; from 
the "Letters on Economy" program--live] 
  [Text] [Bober] Mr. Minister, the election slogan of "It 
Doesn't Have To Be This Way Any More" is being replaced by the 
slogan of "It Could Be Even Worse." As we heard, the number of 
unemployed will probably exceed 3 million people today. So what 
does a labor minister actually do? 
  [Miller] You know, as I was watching the press conference by 
[the former chief of the National Radio and Television 
Broadcasting Council] Mr. Markiewicz, a thought occurred to me 
that the situation has indeed deteriorated, except that is not a 
result of Pawlak government's measures, or even of the 
coalition's measures. I am sure it will not deteriorate further 
in the future but in order to be able to assess that, let us 
meet in a year's time and see what the results are. 
  [Bober] What does a labor minister do? 
  [Miller] He deals with [hesitating] providing protection for 
the process of transformations. Your colleague here in the 
studio was kind enough to mention my ministry's name. I would 
say my ministry's goal is to lessen the pain of the 
transformations, that is to say its goal is to make sure that 
the pain does not become unbearable and that it does not rise to 
a level where society refuses to give its consent anymore to the 
inherent cost of the transformations. 
  [Bober] So the Labor Ministry deals with providing social 
benefits? 
  [Miller] Not just that, but the ministry also makes efforts 
to establish a new labor regime which would be adapted to the 
market economy; it also tries to change the system of social 
benefits by conducting a deep reform of social benefits, and an 
active social policy. But I understand you are mainly 
interested in unemployment. 
  Well, I have been trying to convince my colleagues in the 
government that if just one minister was charged to deal with 
unemployment and with fighting it, then of course nothing would 
ever change. I can remember a sentence spoken by [former 
Swedish] Prime Minister Palme in which he said that in his 
cabinet, every single minister is charged with unemployment. 
Perhaps that is somewhat of an overstatement but in any event, 
I have been trying to promote an approach under which every 
minister--in particular chiefs of economic ministries--while 
making various economic decisions, should be asking himself a 
question of what impact the decision will have on the 
unemployment situation. 
  [Bober] I see. We will return to that theme but let us keep 
discussing the ministry's role for a while longer. Last year, 
the ministry devoted 3.5 trillion zlotys for [unemployment] 
benefits, training courses, and loans to the unemployed, while 
this year, there are plans for the figure to rise to 5.7 
trillion, not counting the 1 trillion which you [addressing 
Miller] quote, stole, unquote from [Land Use Management and 
Construction] Minister Blida. 
  Mr. Minister, these monies are not actually devoted to 
creating new jobs, but to the protections that you described, is 
that not so? 
  [Miller] No, no, they are largely devoted to creation of new 
jobs. You mentioned the almost 6 trillion zlotys which is 
devoted to so-called active forms of fighting unemployment. 
What are these active forms about? They include public works, 
interventionist measures, gaining new skills, and loans to the 
unemployed--these are naturally the most efficient type of 
measures. The real drama is about [hesitating] the fact that 
out of the Labor Fund, 90 percent of the financial means were 
devoted to unemployment benefits up to now, and only 10 percent, 
which we talked about, to active forms of fighting unemployment. 
What I tried to do was to increase the amount [devoted to the 
active forms], that is to say to change the disadvantageous 
ratios there. If the Sejm adopts the budget draft, then we will 
be able to increase the figure of 10 percent to 13 percent. 
That, of course, is only a slight increase, but it is better 
than no increase at all. 
  [Bober] I see. But the thing is, we are trying to use 
percentages as consolation here but my understanding is that 
during sessions of the Council of Ministers for instance, you 
meet with the other ministers. So how would you explain this 
strange situation where schools are educating future experts as 
we speak, but we already know at this stage that nobody will 
need those experts in a year, half a year, or two years? So the 
other ministries contribute to creating unemployment? 
  [Miller] Yes, you are right on that point. I mentioned the 
economic ministries but you rightly noted that there is also the 
Education Ministry, but I must admit that there have been some 
changes occurring recently, I mean that ministry has taken 
counteractive measures against any further functioning of 
schools whose graduates are bound not to find jobs in the 
region--these are mainly vocational schools, ones attached to 
factories and plants. And of course, without a close 
cooperation.... 
  [Bober, interrupting] I see. But my understanding is that 
there must also be some cooperation with the Finance Ministry 
since it has the means either to promote or restrict 
entrepreneurship through its tax system and financial 
arrangements. In a situation where tax thresholds are raised on 
a motion of the Finance Ministry, then what is the result of 
that? The result is that the so-called gray area widens, 
incentives to work disappear, there occurs a willingness to hide 
one's own income, but it does not serve at all the cause of 
development. 
  [Miller] You are right in a way, but on the other hand, one 
cannot abandon the tax system completely. But I agree with 
you.... 
  [Bober, interrupting] I am not in favor of such a move. 
  [Miller] I agree with you that the tax system should promote 
entrepreneurship and that is why my view is--and we will submit 
such proposals--that one must widen the system of various [tax] 
breaks, especially for investors who want to invest in areas 
which are particularly endangered by unemployment, I mean in 
gminas [small administrative units] particularly endangered by 
unemployment. There are over 400 such gminas, out of the total 
of about 2,500. So you see it is a very [hesitating] serious 
problem. We must look for new kinds of measures, for instance 
such measures that create incentives to those workplaces which 
employ graduates. Let me cite for you a really tragic number: 
About 30 percent of all the unemployed are young people, less 
than 24 years old. That number indicates how big the drama and 
the phenomenon [of unemployment] really is. 
  [Bober] The last report of the Business Center Club, which 
was released last week, suggests that there is... [Bober pauses] 
That Polish entrepreneurs can see a danger for the market 
economy. Now, if they can see a danger for the market economy, 
that means that they can see a threat for the industrial 
development in general. Again, the issue of creating new 
workplaces is being curbed, in a way. 
  [Miller] I believe that these are all exaggerated.... 
  [Bober, interrupting] Exaggerated? 
  [Miller] Exaggerated fears concerning the question of how 
unemployment can be eliminated. I think that two conditions 
must be met; first, the economic growth. We have a 4 percent 
economic growth; however, economic growth alone is still too 
little.... 
  [Bober, interrupting] Perhaps this is within the limits of 
statistical error? 
  [Miller] In Spain, for instance, there is a lot of economic 
growth, but at the same time, 20 percent of the country is 
unemployed. Apart from the economic growth, there must be an 
active form of creating the labor market. That means.... 
[Miller pauses] I have already briefly discussed those active 
forms; however, I believe that we should take greater care of 
the regions threatened by unemployment as well as the social 
groups which are particularly threatened by unemployment. We 
should try to decrease unemployment there... 
  [Bober, interrupting] I understand; however, Mr. Minister, 
do you think that your colleagues, industry minister, ownership 
transformations minister, are of the same opinion? Indeed, I 
must agree with the view that it is not your ministry that 
creates unemployment. It is, actually, the activities of these 
ministries that create unemployment. Are they aware of these 
simple economic interdependences? 
  [Miller] You have placed me in a very difficult 
situation.... 
  [Bober, interrupting] I want you to evaluate your 
colleagues. 
  [Miller] If I mention one minister and not the others, they 
will be offended. However, I have gotten the impression, 
especially in the recent weeks, that this agreement is greater, 
especially with the industry minister and the ownership 
transformations minister. You have mentioned Minister Blida. I 
would like to comment on that. Our conflict lies in the 
following.... 
  [Bober, interrupting] That you take money away and she gives 
it back. 
  [Miller] 1.250 trillion zlotys are reserved for the 
implementation of a law that does not yet exist. This law on 
apartment rentals and expenditures will come into effect on 1 
October this year--at the soonest. Until that time this money 
will not be used, probably to the satisfaction mainly of 
Minister Misiag--but not to my satisfaction. I suggest that 
this money be paid to people earlier; that is, the apartment 
allowances should be paid beginning on 1 April, once the budget 
is passed. The poorest families, which can obtain this money 
earlier, cannot wait until October, November, or December. 
  [Bober] Mr. Minister, can you possibly precisely answer the 
question of when we will really be able to see new workplaces 
created? 
  [Miller] Well, actually we still have two years to stop 
the process of increasing unemployment. It is worth recalling 
that it was supposed to amount to 400,000 when the process of 
transformation in Poland was just beginning in 1990. Why am I 
saying that we have two years? Because after that time, for 
demographical reasons, the number of young people looking for a 
job will rise dramatically. In line with some data, by 2010, in 
Poland there will be approximately 50 percent of the unemployed 
in the entire European labor market, with the exception of the 
states of the former Soviet Union. Therefore, we must make 
quite a fundamental breakthrough in this area over the two 
years; otherwise, we will not be able to control this process 
later on. 
  [Bober] That means that it is difficult to say precisely 
when we will be able to see.... 
  [Miller, interrupting] I believe that it will be in the 
middle of this year, in May and June. At that time the number, 
which has already amounted to 3 million, will start to drop. 
This is related to the fact that we will start large-scale 
welfare work, intervention work; second, I think that these 
harbingers of the economic recovery will result in rather 
positive results. 
  [Bober] Thank you, Mr. Minister, for these explanations. 
They are not very comforting.... 
  [Miller] They are just as they are.... 
  [Bober, interrupting] However, it is not for this reason 
that we have invited you to the program. We rather wanted you 
to present the dangers of this situation, because it really is 
dangerous. 
  [Miller] Yes, the situation is really very dangerous. I 
believe that, if possible, as early as this year the Sejm should 
adopt an all-national program of combating unemployment. Why 
all-national? Because this task exceeds the strength of one 
ministry, or even the government. The state must take advantage 
of all the instruments that it has at its disposal. 
  [Bober] Thank you for these explanations. 
  [Baczynski] Mr. Minister, I think that, contrary to what 
Andrzej Bober said, many economists would consider you an 
extreme optimist--if you assume that in the middle of the year 
unemployment will stop increasing. According to some forecasts, 
we will not manage to avoid the level of 5 million unemployed, 
or an index such as in Spain--over 20 percent. Professor Kabaj, 
among others, forecasts that already now, if we took into 
consideration the concealed unemployment, there would be at 
least 1.5 million or 2 million more unemployed than the 
statistics actually show.... 
  [Miller, interrupting] According to other statistics, this 
unemployment is smaller than the number of registered persons. 
We simply have a margin of persons who register themselves on 
those unemployment lists for other reasons. 
  [Baczynski] At any rate, we wish you good luck. 
  [Miller] Thank you.

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky has said in 
Washington that although Hungarian foreign policy is basically 
directed toward the West, ties with Russia also have to be 
consolidated. Following his talks with U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Perry, Geza Jeszenszky said that the United States is 
beginning to understand Hungary's special position in connection 
with Vojvodina and that the Serbs are wrong to think that the 
Hungarians treat them as an enemy. Further details about Geza 
Jesznszky's visit to Wasington are given by Miklos Martin Kovacs: 
  [Kovacs] The United States sees clearly that the Hungarian 
Government's intention is also to settle the Balkan crisis as 
soon as possible and in the fairest way. [passage omitted] 
  Also in Washington, in the White House's Roosevelt Hall, 
President Clinton met members of organizations representing the 
Visegrad countries in America -- Czechs, Poles, Hungarians, and 
Slovaks. Laszlo Papp, one of the five Hungarian participants in 
the meeting representing the local branch of the World 
Federation of Hungarians, told Hungarian Radio that President 
Clinton made it clear that his government continues to rely on 
their opinion, since it pays special attention to 
Eastern-Central Europe and the U.S. Government is clear about 
the interests of the region. Bill Clinton added that the two 
main American concerns when evaluating the various governments 
are the progress of privatization and the enforcement of 
democracy.

<F P=106> [Interview with FRY Ambassador to Bulgaria Rados Smilkovic </F>
by Plamen Kulinski; place and date not given: "Relations 
Between Sofia and Belgrade Are Good, But Not What They Could and 
Should Be"] 
  [Excerpts] [Kulinski] Mr. Ambassador, how do you assess 
the latest developments in the situation in Sarajevo following 
the NATO ultimatum? Do you agree with the calls made by certain 
Western politicians and by Ankara that one should also proceed 
along the same path to settle the problems in other disputed 
enclaves in Bosnia? 
  [Smilkovic] I used to explain to my students that the NATO 
pact was a military factor in the tragic balance of fear during 
the years of the cold war. Now the eastern bloc has disappeared, 
together with its bastion -- the Warsaw Pact, thus making NATO 
superfluous. Accordingly, NATO is now seeking a new role, so as 
to prove that it is still needed. It was scared by the end of 
the civil war in the Balkans, so it launched a campaign with its 
most terrible weapons against the Serbs to make it impossible 
for them to conclude a peace treaty. Knowing that the Serbs are 
a proud and brave nation, it issued an ultimatum to them to pull 
out of Sarajevo and leave their compatriots defenseless. NATO 
knew that the Serbs cannot accept such a solution, just as they 
rejected it in 1941 and rose to arms to help their allies -- 
Great Britain, France, America, and Russia. 
  Yet again, in this century, Russia is saving Europe from its 
own evil by returning to the labyrinths of the Balkans to 
establish order by force. On behalf of Russia, President 
Yeltsin appealed to the Serbs in Bosnia to withdraw their heavy 
weapons from the territory of Sarajevo and allow Russian blue 
helmets to take over peacekeeping in this region. Europe has 
been saved from being plunged into a new war without borders. 
  It will be bad it they attempt to act in a similar way in 
future, if other states, especially Turkey, join in the 
conflict. The warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina must be 
given the chance of achieving peace themselves by peaceful 
means. When, in the past, others separated them [the warring 
parties], as certain of our former allies are attempting to do 
now, peace was always pushed further away. It does not become 
democratic Europe to establish a new world order by air strikes. 
Those who speak on behalf of the old Europe should know that 
"blood is the wrong food for men." [passage omitted] 
  [Kulinski] Is the idea still alive that the Macedonians are 
"southern Serbs?" 
  [Smilkovic] Ideas do not die; they are realized, disappear 
into history, or are forgotten. As regards the expression 
"southern Serbs," it was not invented. From the time of their 
arrival in the Balkan peninsula, most of the Serbs lived in 
compact groups in the southern part of the peninsula. Their 
centuries-long sense of statehood and spirituality are tied up 
with these territories, monasteries, schools, hospitals, and 
graveyards. Although they are now destroyed and neglected, they 
continue to serve as a living proof, Apart from this, it is 
well-known that, in medieval times, Skopje was the capital of 
the most powerful Serbian rulers. 
  As regards the Macedonians, in the Serbian perception, they 
are a separate fraternal Slavonic nation that lives in Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], where 
Serbs, Bulgarians, and other nationalities also live. In former 
Yugoslavia, this fact was suppressed and never mentioned. The 
Serbs also disregarded it in the socialist period, so as to 
demonstrate greater broad- mindedness toward the other peoples, 
especially the Macedonians. Unfortunately, some questions 
relating to the position of the Serbs in Macedonia are still not 
resolved, and for this reason various sides are misusing them in 
their everyday politics. What is worst of all, the same thing 
is also being done by those who are working from outside to 
poison the relations between the peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Kulinski] The Bulgarians in Serbia are also suffering 
privations at the present. There is apprehension that political 
pressure is being applied to them to make the Bulgarian 
population forget their national identity. How well-founded are 
these claims? 
  [Smilkovic] The population is finding it difficult to live 
in Montenegro as well as Serbia. All share this same fate, 
including the Bulgarian national minority. The sanctions were 
imposed against the citizens of Yugoslavia, irrespective of 
their national affiliation. The Bulgarian minority is finding 
it a little easier to bear the sanctions than the others, partly 
because of the humanitarian aid that is sent directly from 
Bulgaria, and partly due to the other benefits that living close 
to the border in such circumstances provides. 
  There are no grounds for concern whether the Bulgarians in 
the FRY can preserve their national identity. They enjoy all 
the rights that the other citizens possess, and have every 
opportunity to express their Bulgarian nationality in education, 
culture, and other field of life. The best example is 
Dimitrovgrad Municipality: There one in every three citizens has 
a job. Although 52 percent of the population of the 
municipality are Bulgarians, there are very few non-Bulgarians 
occupying municipal posts or directorships of enterprises. 
Although there are about 25,000 Bulgarians in Yugoslavia, you 
can find them in the highest posts in the economic sector and 
state administration. In Serbia, each deputy represents on 
average 50,000 electors, yet a Bulgarian is a deputy in the 
Serbian Skupshtina, even though the Bulgarians only have 
one-third of the necessary votes. The Bulgarians in Serbia are 
clever people and are against living in the ghetto that 
individual chauvinist nationalists want to drive them into. The 
length to which their so- called "champions" are prepared to go 
is simply ludicrous. I recently read somewhere that they 
[Bulgarians in Serbia] are deprived of their own language even 
in the churches in Serbia. If one follows this logic, the Serbs 
are threatened as well, because the language used in religion is 
Church Slavonic. It is not good to claim, in these bad times 
that the Serbian people are experiencing, that the Bulgarian 
minority is threatened in the Serbian state. I have yet to read 
in the press here that Bulgarians living as a minority in any 
other land have greater rights than in Serbia and are more 
satisfied with their lives. I will not raise any other issues, 
because I do not want to create difficulties for our Bulgarian 
brothers; it is quite enough that others are making difficulties 
for them. 
  [Kulinski] How do you assess relations between Sofia and 
Belgrade? 
  [Smilkovic] Our relations are good, but not what they could 
and should be between two neighboring states and peoples. There 
is a widespread view and feeling among the people of Yugoslavia, 
especially in Serbia, that compared with similar situations that 
have arisen during this century -- this is already the third 
blockade of Serbia, relations between Bulgarians and Serbs have 
never been better. The statements by Bulgarian leaders and 
citizens protesting against the air strikes on the Serbian 
positions in Sarajevo and calling for peace talks to end the war 
had a good reception. The rally in Sofia was regarded in both 
the Yugoslav republics as the voice of reason, as a warning to 
the gods of war. The links between our two peoples are very 
deep, because we have been living side by side from time 
immemorial. They cannot be severed by any blockades. Since 
cooperation and dialogue has not been broken off among the 
people, it should not cease between our leaderships either. The 
country of Yugoslavia is open to any kind of democratic dialogue 
and cooperation, and I am here to help in ensuring that our 
cooperation is intensive and fruitful. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Zagreb, March 2 (AFP) -- Serb and Croat leaders 
showed a mixed reaction to the Moslem-Croat federation agreement 
Wednesday. Bosnian Moslems mainly welcomed it but others 
involved in the conflict doubted its viability and voiced fears 
it would either entrench an imperfect peace or prolong the war 
by allowing Moslems and Croats to join forces against the Serbs. 
  In Zagreb, Croat Government officials suggested the 
agreement 
was a "compromise" with an uncertain outlook. 
  Under the agreement, signed in Washington Tuesday by Bosnian 
Moslem and Croat leaders, the Bosnian federation will be 
composed of a number of cantons inhabited mainly by Bosnian 
Croats and Moslems. They will be granted equal national rights, 
with a central government in charge of foreign affairs, defense 
and trade. 
  "It is clear that the agreement is a compromise," Mate 
Granic, the Croatian foreign minister and a signatory of the 
accord told Croatia's government-controlled daily VECERNJI LIST. 
  In its editorial on the agreement, the paper said: "The 
vanquished in this affair are certainly the Croats. 
  "The Serbs will undoubtedly keep all their gains. And the 
Moslems will be saved from destruction in a state which is a lot 
closer to their idea of the homeland than the way the Croats 
think of it," the paper added. 
  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was not consulted 
in the talks, said in Moscow that he was "studying" the 
agreement but added that Serbians should have been involved. 
"We can welcome this agreement only if it is not aimed against 
Serbs. Only if it leads us to peace and not war," he said. 
  For the Bosnian Government, Gradimir Gojer, a Croatian and 
minister without portfolio in Sarajevo, said he now expected the 
United States to "put pressure on the Serb side, using the 
Russians" to get the Serbs to join the federation. "You can't 
reject the third nation who wants to live with us," he added. 
  Russia, which held talks with Karadzic Wednesday, said the 
accord was "a new turning point in the negotiations." Russian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin said that "if correctly 
applied it could play a positive role in the political 
settlement of the Bosnian conflict," the INTERFAX news agency 
reported. [passage omitted] 
  The strongest negative reaction came in Belgrade where 
Vladislav Jovanovic, the foreign minister of the rump 
Yugoslavia, warned that "the creation of a bloc, two parties 
against a third" would defeat the objective of peace. 
  Momcilo Krajisnik, the president of the self-styled Bosnian 
Serb parliament, told the Serbian Radio Novi Sad: "The Serbs 
will not accept a solution which harms the interests of the Serb 
people." [passage omitted] 
  In Sarajevo, Hafiz Ismet Spahic, the second highest cleric 
in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's Moslem community, summed up the pragmatic 
nature of the agreement. "We have to live in marriage, even if 
we don't love each other. Our interests are much stronger than 
the fact that we are not in love," he said.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 2 (AFP) -- The final accord creating 
a Bosnian federation of Croats and Moslems will be signed on 
March 15 in Washington, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic 
said in a television interview here Wednesday [2 March]. 
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and his Croatian 
counterpart Franjo Tudjman will sign the document, following the 
accord reached Tuesday [1 March], Silajdzic said from Washington. 
  The accord calls for a federation of Bosnian Croats and 
Moslems, comprising a number of cantons. The cantons would have 
equal rights, with a central government in charge of foreign 
affairs, defense and trade. Bosnian Serbs are not included in 
the deal. 
  Silajdzic added that experts from the two sides would in the 
meantime work on a new constitution, both for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and for a future confederation of the Bosnian and Croatian 
republics. These experts would meet in the U.S. embassies in 
Vienna, he said. Silajdzic said he would shortly travel to 
Moscow.

<F P=106> [Article by Jitka Kucerova on 2 March cabinet meeting] </F>
  [Text] According to Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, the 
Cabinet has discussed granting the Exim Bank guarantees for the 
completion of the building of Temelin nuclear power station. 
The Czech side has received a report that this problem was 
discussed yesterday between the Austrian ambassador and the 
president of the bank and some U.S. senators. Vaclav Klaus 
stressed that the government is following all of the activities 
of the Austrian side closely; he said he assumes that Austria's 
negative attitude will not be accepted, and guarantees will be 
dealt with positively in the congressional debate on 10 March. 
  The government also accepted a report on the situation of 
the 
customs union. Vaclav Klaus said: 
  [Begin Klaus recording] The Czech Government is apprehensive 
about the latest development. It is aware of the complexity of 
the situation on the Slovak side. Nevertheless, it interprets 
the debates on certificates, norms, and so on as finer forms of 
protectionism, and we consider this an unfortunate infringement 
of the current practice and style of foreign trade relations.

<F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks are in Macedonian with </F>
Greek subtitles] 
  [Text] In a statement to ET-1, Kiro Gligorov, president of 
Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM], 
appeared prepared to bring the name issue to the negotiating 
table with Greece. Responding to a question by our special 
correspondent Yeoryios Kharvalias, the Skopjean president 
explained his reservations about the name Slavomacedonia but 
left open the possibility of accepting a compound name. 
  [Begin recording] [Gligorov] "I said that we are prepared to 
discuss all unresolved issues and I believe that the best 
solution will emerge as a result of such a dialogue. Let us 
examine all the arguments. Concerning the name Slavomacedonia, 
I must stress that we are a multinational state. A name that 
would define us nationally must be accepted by all the residents 
of the country and not intensify problems between the 
minorities. However, I repeat once again that everything must 
be put on the negotiating table." 
  [Kharvalias] This important statement by Kiro Gligorov, 
which 
outlines his intention for a discussion of all the issues, 
including the name, was made to ET-1 and moves the stagnant 
waters after many months of Skopjean intransigence, which led 
the Greek Government to proceed with the blockade. Is this a 
tactical maneuver or a substantial turn in Gligorov's policy? 
Time will tell. However, it is interesting to hear what Mr. 
Gligorov said when we asked him what he expects from the meeting 
Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will have with UN 
mediator Cyrus Vance in Geneva on 10 March. 
  [Gligorov] "According to my information, the Vance-Papoulias 
meeting in Geneva is to make preparations for a bilateral 
meeting. I am not in a position to say when this meeting will 
take place. Everything will depend on what happens in Geneva. 
However, within the framework of protecting peace, a friendly 
settlement of the differences between Greece and Skopje depends 
on goodwill, and the resumption of talks under the UN auspices 
appears as the only reasonable solution. I think that it is 
time for the measures to be lifted and for us to proceed with 
open discussions on all issues. On our part, we have nothing but 
goodwill, and I hope that with mutual understanding the problems 
can be solved." 
  [Kharvalias] The Skopjean president was for the first time 
relatively conciliatory when asked about the three Greek 
conditions for the resumption of the dialogue. He said: There 
is goodwill on our part to discuss all the pending issues 
including the three Greek prerequisites. He added: However, it 
is not right for these to be set as conditions. If we accept 
everything in advance what would be left to discuss? The 
Skopjean leader expressed his displeasure at the recent Greek 
measures. However, his statements were made in a relatively 
mild tone. 
  Mr. Gligorov said indicatively: I believe this is not a 
creative approach for two neighboring countries such as Greece 
and Skopje that are not facing major problems. Instead of 
understanding, we have an embargo on a bilateral basis without a 
Security Council decision, as was the case with Serbia. 
  Mr. Gligorov's position on relations with the neighboring 
countries was also important. He said: We must have friendly 
relations with states such as Albania, Bulgaria, and the 
Yugoslav Federation. As for Turkey, relations are good but 
nothing special, Mr. Gligorov added. The Skopjean president 
also commented on the aid granted to his country by neighboring 
Albania. He said: We were using and will continue to use 
Albanian routes to transport goods to our state, but I do not 
see the reason why preconditions should be set concerning the 
Albanian minority living in Skopje. 
  Finally, we asked the Skopjean president about his country's 
relations with the United States in the light of U.S. 
recognition, which has not been accompanied by the establishment 
of diplomatic relations. 
  [Kharvalias, in English] The United States recently 
recognized your country as FYROM but it has declined to 
establish diplomatic relations. Does Mr. President think that 
this is a matter of time? 
  [Gligorov] "Usually, when a country recognizes another 
country it intends to establish diplomatic relations. So, I 
believe that the opening of an American embassy in Skopje is 
merely a matter of time." [end recording]

decision on the recall of the chairman of the National Radio and

any legal basis. The leader of the Conservative Party [PK], 
Aleksander Hall, has also protested against the method of 
dismissal of Marek Markiewicz. He feels that the activities of 
the president are, regardless of his intentions, such as to 
bring disturbance into the public life of the country and to 
favor destabilization. 
  The press spokesman of the Constitutional Tribunal, Adam 
Jankiewicz, has reported that the tribnunal may consider an 
application on the matter of the determination of a ruling on 
the decision of President Lech Walesa on the recall of the 
chairman of KRRiT over a period of at least two weeks from its 
being received by the tribunal.

  [Text] A statement issued by the Albanian Helsinki 
Committee states that, with the attack against cultural and 
scientific institutions, a new wave of violence has fallen on 
the Albanian population of Kosova. Such institutions as the 
Academy of Sciences and the Albanological Institute, which enjoy 
a high prestige that surpasses Kosova borders and have scored 
achievements that have been recognized outside the Albanian 
world, are now being threatened directly with closure by the 
repressive Serb power. 
  The statement says that the Albanian Helsinki Committee 
considers this a further escalation of the campaign against 
human rights and the individual and collective rights of the 
Albanian population that is systematically conducted by the 
Serbian authorities. 
  After the closure of Albanian schools, the suspension of 
Albanian television and radio programs, and the dismissal of 
dozens of thousands of employees on the only basis of being of 
Albanian national origin, this is a new measure that enters the 
framework of that alreadt known notorious plan, which aims to 
uproot the Albanian population, and isolate and segregate it to 
make its life unbearable on its ancient territories. 
  Increasingly, the Serbian regime in Kosova is assuming the 
features of an apartheid regime. By losing every feeling of 
responsibility, the Serbian authorities are not stopping their 
dangerous course that may lead the present crisis in Kosova into 
an open conflict in Serbian-Albanian relations and further 
terrible consequences for the overall peace in the region. 
  The statement ends adding that the Albanian Helsinki 
Committee regretfully makes this act known to the Vienna-based 
International Helsinki Federation and all the Helsinki 
committees that act in the name and defense of the great 
principles [words indistinct] of cooperation in Europe. The 
Committee also calls on them to raise their voice to denounce 
the escalation of repression in Kosova.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Journalist Martin Leka Sentenced to 18 Months </F>
Imprisonment"] 
  [Text] The newspaper KOHA JONE has paid a costly ransom to 
the state. Martin Leka was yesterday sentenced to 18 months 
imprisonment, while editor-in-chief Aleksander Frangaj left the 
courtroom not guilty. Officer Bashkim Feta's one month in 
detention was considered punishment enough and he was released, 
while Romeo Licaj, who provided the newspaper with the document 
that was considered secret, was sentenced to four years 
imprisonment. We have no reason for joy, and can only shed tears 
over this insult and humiliation. We have been humiliated 
because Martin Leka was pronounced guilty because of the coffees 
he drank with the officer Romeo Licaj, because of the car with 
the Lezhe license plate that brought the defense minister's 
document to the editorial office, and for working in the Lezhe 
bank alongside Romeo Licaj's wife. 
  Martin Leka did not return to the editorial office 
yesterday. 
He was sent to Tirana prison together with Romeo Licaj as an 
accomplice in revealing secrets. The court considered to be a 
secret the minister of defense's order for officers to hand in 
their personal weapons. According to a decree signed by Adil 
Carcani in 1982, the bench considered Safet Zhulali's order to 
be a state secret. 
  Presiding Judge Arben Ristani did not consider the defense's 
evidence, but pronounced Martin Leka guilty, considering him as 
having encouraged the revelation of a secret. The fact that 
Martin Leka drank coffee with Romeo Licaj cannot be either a 
legal or a logical argument, still less when Romeo Licaj denied 
having talked to Martin Leka about Zhulali's order. They might 
have talked about Zhulali's portrait or about NATO membership. 
However, the court did not prove this. We therefore say that 
Martin Leka was sentenced for unverifiable collaboration on the 
basis of speculation. It cannot be proved that Martin Leka 
encouraged Romeo Licaj to reveal the secret. We therefore feel 
insulted and humiliated by the court's spiteful decision, 
because Martin Leka's profession, to which he has devoted his 
life and for which he sacrificed his freedom, was ignored. He 
was not tried as a journalist. Martin would have agreed to 
become a sacrificial lamb for the gods, if he could have 
believed that justice would thereby become a god for the 
Albanians. However, the facts are otherwise. Martin Leka's 
sentences show that for a long time yet the Albanians must mourn 
forcibly sacrificed lambs.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Brand of Shame on the Face of Justice"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday's sensational trial ended with a verdict 
worthy of the deviousness of our rulers and their unprincipled 
sycophants. Aleksander Frangaj's's dose of prison was added to 
that of the journalist Martin Leka, while that of the serviceman 
Feta was added to that of the officer Romeo Licaj. Thus, the 
production plan was fulfilled in total, but not item by item. 
  This political and legal farce does not raise a smile. On 
the contrary, journalists and all citizens who honor, value, and 
are prepared to make sacrifices for free speech are downcast and 
indignant today. Martin Leka is the first Albanian journalist 
to be sentenced to prison. This is no longer a sign, but an 
ominous fact in itself for democracy. Leka was sentenced to 18 
months' imprisonment simply because he bravely exercised his 
profession as journalist in order to inform the public about a 
true fact, on which he commented according to his own 
independent convictions. 
  Martin Leka is today a political prisoner and his 
persecutors 
have names and surnames. First among them is Defense Minister 
Safet Zhulali, this civilian who walks with head held high while 
successive scandals perch on his shoulders like a general's 
epaulets. The foot-soldiers of the state's judiciary are afraid 
to investigate the dollars lost by Zhulali, and are afraid to 
investigate the ship Sotirios. Zhulali makes his confession 
with his hand on his heart to a little German magazine, saying 
all kinds of things about the Albanian Army, and then has the 
shamelessness to demand the imprisonment of a journalist who has 
written about one of his orders. Zhulali has chosen his own 
road, but his career ended at the moment when he launched his 
attack on journalists and succeeded in sending one to prison. 
  The second is Arben Qeleshi, the Tirana procurator. This 
"unprincipled sycophant of Berisha's regime," as Martin Leka 
called him in his speech of defense, deserves the "credit" of 
having handcuffed a journalist in his office. It emerged at the 
trial that Qeleshi had no charge sheet. The defendants' counsel 
insisted at length on this legal point, but perhaps it did not 
occur to them that, in the mentality of sycophants, there is no 
need for charge sheets. A verbal order or a gnash of the teeth 
is enough to set them to work. Qeleshi threw Leka in jail, 
accusing him of slander. On this charge, the journalist 
languished in a cell for one month. Then came the day of the 
trial, and it emerged that there had been no slander, but a 
secret had been revealed. Normally, Qeleshi should be punished 
and dismissed for incompetence and malpractice, begging Martin 
Leka's pardon. But such miracles happen in an independent 
judiciary. Arben Qeleshi's friends changed the charge against 
Martin Leka and sentenced him in cold blood. 
  It was never for a moment demonstrated to the court that 
Zhulali's order constituted a secret. The list of secrets was 
never brought forward. On the contrary, it was not only proved 
that Zhulali's order was not a secret, but that it was also 
illegal. 
  It was not for a moment proved in court that the journalist 
Leka and the officer Licaj had "collaborated in a crime." The 
prosecutors and the judge considered the fact that they both 
lived in Lezhe and had several times drunk coffee together to be 
"collaboration in a crime." This is the logic of Svejk or, if 
you like, Qazim Mulleeti [Tirana humorist], forbidding people to 
meet in twos and threes. 
  The court did not prove Martin Leka's guilt, and could not 
do 
so as long as no crime existed. Arben Ristani, the judge at the 
trial, this young lad with a sleepy and contented expression, 
was invited in vain to take as his example the independence and 
dignity of American judges. However, Ristani decided this time 
that Martin Leka should be the suffering Socrates. Well, better 
that way than to sit like a satisfied pig. 
  Thus, Arben Ristani committed a fatal blunder in his 
just-begun career by sentencing a journalist for revealing 
secrets in a country with political pluralism. He put a bad 
mark against his name in the book of justice that we want to 
write. One is genuinely sorry. That is all. As for those who 
imagine that this sentence has taught the press a lesson, 
whether Ristani himself or his political and nonpolitical 
bosses, let them not rejoice too soon. There is no stopping or 
scaring the press. 
  The sentencing of Martin Leka is a mark of shame on the 
face of Albanian justice that, as in the time of the 
single-party dictatorship, has capitulated under democracy to 
the instructions, pressures, and unbridled appetites of the 
political establishment, striking with an iron fist against the 
free press and against young journalists who do not dance to the 
tune of moldy minds that govern as if in the days of Enver. 
  The journalist's sentencing is therefore a serious 
indictment 
of the political regime today and of the demagogy and cynicism 
of a state that, on the one hand, shouts about human rights and 
freedom of the press and, on the other hand, complains about 
journalists' irresponsibility in revealing in free elections, 
while there will no doubt be a court of justice for those who 
have personally committed crimes. 
  Martin Leka has today been sentenced. The Albanian press has 
suffered a serious blow to its freedom of conscience, which we 
feel with pain and in a spirit of solidarity with our handcuffed 
colleague. However, nobody must imagine that the press will be 
frightened and cowed. Confronted with such shamelessness, free 
newspapers and journalists know only the motto: "Fight for the 
truth." It is with this motto that journalists see off to 
prison their colleague Martin Leka, this young journalist who 
with his good sense, courage, and wisdom, has unexpectedly 
become the symbol of a free press.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Andjelko Perincic from Tirana] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Perincic] Our embassy was opened in the capital 
of Albania today in a formal ceremony held in the presence of 
Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of Croatia. The 
ceremony was attended by the leadership of this friendly 
country: Albania President Sali Berisha, Pjeter Arbnori, 
president of the People's Assembly, and Prime Minister 
Aleksander Meksi. Also present were members of the diplomatic 
corps and many citizens of the host country. 
  Following a speech by Croatian Ambassador in Tirana Mladen 
Jurisic, those present were addressed by Croatian President 
Franjo Tudjman. 
  [Begin Tudjman recording] The opening of the Croatian 
Embassy 
in Tirana marks the beginning of something special in that it is 
the continuation of the (?historical) links between the Croatian 
and Albanian people ever since the Illyrian times. [end 
recording] 
  [Perincic] Let us remember Queen Teuta. The legendary 
Albanian hero, George Kastrioti, is mentioned in Croatian folk 
songs. This is yet more evidence of the links between the two 
peoples. It should not be forgotten, Tudjman went on to add, 
that in the former Yugoslavia under the leadership of Tito, a 
Croat, the Albanians of Kosovo enjoyed all rights, including 
their university and academy. 
  [Begin Tudjman recording] Today, under democratic 
conditions, 
and with the introduction of democratic systems in Croatia and 
Albania, we wish to continue the legacies of history on new 
foundations and in the new situation in which both Albania and 
Croatia need to be the mainstays of the new international order 
in southeast Europe. [end recording] 
  [Perincic] Albanian President Sali Berisha also spoke 
briefly. He expressed the hope that the Croatian Embassy in 
Tirana would serve to enrich cooperation between the two 
countries. He also expressed satisfaction with President 
Tudjman's visit to mark the occasion. He voiced the hope that 
the Croatian and Albanian people will continue to nurture their 
traditionally good relations. In this context he mentioned 
(Milan Suflaj), a Croat expert on Albania, killed at the time of 
the Yugoslav monarchy. [passage omitted]

  [Text] We have just received a report on the activities in 
our country this afternoon of Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. 
  This afternoon, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman visited 
the 
art gallery. Qirjako Meniko, the director of this institution, 
acquainted the high-level guest with the best work of Kole 
Hidromeno, Nexhmedin Zajmi, Odhise Paskali, and other authors. 
During this visit the Croatian president was accompanied by 
Dhimiter Anagnosti, minister of culture, youth, and sports. 
  Several bilateral agreements were signed at the Palace of 
Congresses and the Foreign Ministry today. An agreement on 
cooperation in the field of tourism between the Government of 
the Republic of Albania and the Government of Croatia was signed 
by Ministers Spaho and Bulic. An agreement on petroleum 
research inland between the National Agency of Hydrocarbons and 
Croatian National Company Ina Naft Plin was signed by Fatbardh 
Ademi and Franjo Gregoric. Presidents Berisha and Tudjman were 
present at the signing ceremony. 
  Arian Starova and Ivo Sanader, Albanian and Croatian deputy 
foreign ministers, signed an agreement on cultural, educational, 
and scientific cooperation and an agreement to abolish visas for 
diplomatic and business passports between our two countries. 
  At the end of the two-day visit in Albania, Presidents 
Berisha and Tudjman gave a news conference for reporters. 
  President Berisha pointed out that the visit of President 
Tudjman is a real contribution to the friendly relations between 
Albania and Croatia and that we should expand these relations in 
the political, economic, technical, and scientific fields as 
well as in tourism, education, etc. Croatia is a state under 
attack, and this aggressor is Serbia, President Berisha said. 
  We greet Europe's support for the NATO attack and think that 
this support is indispensable. The Croatian Government can make 
its own contribution to resolving the question of Kosova, 
because we think that there cannot be a solution to the crisis 
in the region without solving the problem of Kosova, President 
Berisha said. He also pointed out that Kosova should be placed 
under an international protectorate. 
  For his part, Croatian President Tudjman stressed that 
Croatia is a friendly country for Albanians. We have been 
historically tied since Illyrian times and even the Croatian 
chronicles write about our common enemies. Croatian literature 
speaks about Queen Teuta and glorifies Scanderberg. As 
countries that lie next to the the Adriatic Sea, Albania and 
Croatia aspire to move toward the European Community. 
  President Tudjman also pointed out that the international 
community has taken powerful steps to solve the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina politically. The Granic-Siladzic talks will 
end in Washington today and a preliminary agreement is expected 
to be drafted, which constitutes a contribution to stopping the 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Berisha and Tudjman later answered reporters' questions. 
Regarding Croatia's attitude toward the Kosova question, 
President Tudjman said that Croatia has been engaged in 
recognizing the rights of the 2 million Albanians who are in 
their lands. 
  Answering a question on Albania's implementation of the 
embargo against Montenegro, President Berisha answered by saying 
that Albania is serious and interested in implementing the 
embargo. However, Albania has requested that Montenegro and 
Kosova be excluded from the embargo because Kosova is under 
Serbian occupation. Meanwhile, Montenegro has maintained a 
different attitude. The application of the embargo by Albania 
has been confirmed by international inspections. 
  The signing of the Partnership for Peace is a very important 
act in the cooperation between Albania and NATO. I think that 
this signing assumes special dimensions. During the days of the 
ultimatum, Albania was among the first countries to be ranked by 
NATO; it clearly and finally demonstrates its definition by the 
Western world and determinedly supports the principles and 
assets that this civilization defends. In this context, I have 
the conviction that this is an important event for all Albanians 
wherever they are. 
  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman ended his official visit 
to 
Albania this evening. Albanian President Sali Berisha was at 
Rinas airport to see him off. Bashkim Kopliku, Council of 
Ministers deputy chairman, Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi, and 
others were also present. The diplomatic corps accredited in 
Tirana was also at Rinas airport. On this occasion the band 
played the national anthems of both our countries, Croatia and 
Albania. The honor guard was also paraded.

<F P=106> [Ana Ansiani article: "Where Are the Sigurimi Collaborators </F>
Today?"] 
  [Text] People, especially public figures, are suffering 
from an anxiety complex. "...surveillance by the State 
Intelligence Service [ShIK]"... Courageous denunciations in the 
press, complaints of telephone bugging, the Probati and Ngjela 
cases with the grim interpellations with Mr. Sigurimi, banished 
three years ago, at least in one of its functions: the 
harassment of party opponents, or of critics of reality in 
general and of the president in particular. Of course, data on 
what citizens think in private cannot be compiled without an 
information network. No intelligence service so far has ever 
worked solely with its permanent staff and without 
collaborators. During the reform of the ShIK, 90 percent of the 
former Sigurimi staff were removed from their posts and replaced 
with new people. However, what has happened to the former 
secret information network, which had its own invisible threads, 
its hangers-on, its internal organization, and its autonomous 
operation? Have these structures been dismantled and their 
members laid off, or have they simply been left to decay? Where 
today are the Sigurimi collaborators, the underwater portion of 
the intelligence iceberg? And -- who are the ShIK's informers? 
Has a new network been created from scratch, or have old 
connections been partially maintained? We have reason to 
believe that the latter is true, when we see today, as in days 
of yore, certain "curious" individuals at whom people point 
their fingers as "provocateurs." This intertwining of two 
networks, this interference of old connections with new, could 
be very dangerous for Albanian politics, and even for the 
country's security. The indecisive attitude of parliamentary 
deputies to the question of the files of former Sigurimi 
collaborators further muddies the issue. They all say they 
favor opening the files, especially when they relate to people 
involved in politics and holding important state offices. 
However, when the time comes for a decision, such a decision is 
always postponed for no convincing reasons. There has not even 
been the kind of broad discussion and debate as took place in 
the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, and elsewhere. 
It seems that the files will be a blackmail weapon for a long 
time, and that politicians will unhesitatingly use them against 
each other. Opening the files would eliminate suspicious, yet 
there are certain persons who have decided to keep suspicions 
alive. They need these suspicions in order to attack each 
other, to denigrate whoever is next in line, to eliminate those 
who are no longer useful, etc. The latest example has been the 
fragment of some kind of file that RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE winkled 
out from who knows where, concerning the deputy Petrit Kalakula, 
the most recent rebel within the ranks of the Democratic Party. 
How quietly the Pobrati affair blew over. The ShIK chairman 
was called to an interpellation in parliament, was asked 
questions, and that was the end of it. Information on 
well-known intellectuals had been sought, but the intellectuals 
made no murmur. Information had been sought on deputies, but 
they, even ministers, forgot everything after a verbal protest 
in parliament.... It seems that everything is just a simple 
show, an ordinary game in which everybody has his own role and 
is conscious of the roles of the others. Students of political 
history consider the involvement of secret services in political 
power games to make the most interesting and mysterious chapters 
in history books. Such a thing is credible, because there is a 
moral to it. How moral is the role of the ShIK in Albanian 
politics?

  [Text] At noon today Albanian President Sali Berisha 
received the delegation of the Party for Democratic Prosperity 
in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM] led by Chairman Arben Xhaferri. 
  I am happy to receive you, President Berisha said, and I 
follow the developments in your party with interest. Its 
recently acquired freedom to function, through the democratic 
mechanism of free vote in the last assembly and free elections 
in your party branches, enables party members to be engaged and 
contribute to the guaranteeing of Albanian human and national 
rights, as well as the development of democracy of Macedonia and 
its stability. An independent and stable Macedonia is in the 
interest not only of Albania, but also of all the peoples in the 
Balkans who are concerned about peace in the region. That is 
why we are determined to increase cooperation with Macedonia in 
the spirit of understanding. The Serb chauvinists and its 
ultranationalist allies desire the destabilization of Macedonia 
today. 
  Your party must accomplish many tasks and should seriously 
work to implement them. The efforts of Albanians today should 
be concentrated in order to prevent conflict, develop and 
promote democracy, and establish local democratic institutions, 
i.e. found various democratic institutions. 
  I want to tell you that the more evident the principles of 
democracy and the present European civilization are for the 
Albanians, the stronger they will be, and the more friends 
Albania and the Albanian nation in general will have. In all 
your efforts, you should assess what has been achieved through 
dialogue and democratic means and insist on the implementation 
of your rights and freedoms in conformity with the Helsinki Act 
and other international documents. 
  For his part, in thanks for the reception, Arben Xhaferri, 
chairman of the Party for Democratic Prosperity of the Albanians 
in Macedonia, said that we support and will contribute to 
stability in Macedonia, but we are not relinquishing efforts to 
raise and strengthen our institutions as centers that generate 
values of patriotism and national rights. Thus can we create 
common valued of civilization with other nationals, which 
together connect us with Europe. I thank the Albanian 
Government for the support it has given and is giving to 
liberate and educate our students. 
  Delegation member Mendu Thaci said that we hope, through 
hard 
work, to give our party its due role, so that the party is 
engaged inasmuch as possible in Macedonian political life. The 
assembly proceedings confirmed that this party enjoys the 
support of Albanians in Macedonia not only through the number of 
members, but also because of the assessment made by the Albanian 
intellectual world.

on Mount Shipka in commemoration of the Russian soldiers, other 
foreign troops, and Bulgarian volunteers who died in battle 
during the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War of Liberation -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Today, 116 years later, as we 
look back over the distance that separates us from that 
memorable event, we see that despite the vicissitudes of fate 
and the trials of history, our people still preserve feelings of 
gratitude and appreciation. Alongside this, however, a sense of 
national dignity has developed, although this was extremely 
debased during the previous regime. Together with the 
democratic process, we have strengthened our efforts to follow 
an independent foreign policy solely in conformity with our 
national interests and with the principles and norms of 
international law. 
  This is why today, while preserving our own firm foreign 
policy orientation toward Europe, toward integration into the 
European structures, toward the Euro-Atlantic system of 
security, the Republic of Bulgaria renounces neither the 
historical and cultural values that bind us to Russia, such as 
our common Slavonic roots, the alphabet introduced by Cyril and 
Methodius, our century-long spiritual and religious links, and 
our national liberation, nor do we renounce our economic 
positions and interests in the Russian markets and the markets 
of the other former Soviet republics. What is more, we consider 
that the historical values that bind us together, cleansed of 
ideological overlays and freed from political exploitation to 
which they were subjected by the communist regime, precisely at 
this time are revealing their true value. Now our relations 
with Russia are being built upon a democratic foundation of 
equality in the eyes of the law. For this reason, no political 
force or group in Bulgaria has the right to appropriate or 
monopolize the links between our two peoples and countries, nor 
identify its narrow party interests with the interests of the 
state in relation to Russia. This was the case at one time, and 
the sad results of it are sufficiently well-known to all. 
  On a day such as this, I believe it is important that we 
should show that we have dissociated ourselves from violence and 
phobias, to recall what happened more than a century ago, and to 
realize that we are first and foremost citizens of the Republic 
of Bulgaria, within which we not only live but also have common 
national interests. In this context, it is foolish to put our 
relations with one group of countries in opposition to those 
with others. Partisanship in foreign policy has never brought 
anything good for our country, all the more now, when the 
Balkans are an extremely explosive region. 
  Apart from everything else, the Third of March returns our 
thoughts to Bulgaria's unrealized national ideals. Taught by 
the bitter experience of four wars and the ravages wrought by 
two uprisings in this century, today we seek to realize these 
ideals not though shifting borders, but through opening them up 
with free intercourse, by making the Balkans an inseparable part 
of a single, democratic, united, civilized Europe. 
  Homage to the bright memory of the heroes of the War of 
Liberation!

<F P=106> [Article by "cer": "Devaty Congratulates CIA on Success] </F>
  [Text] Prague--Stanislav Devaty, acting director of Czech 
counterintelligence, BIS, commented yesterday on the case of 
exposed Russian spy Aldrich Ames, otherwise a high-ranking 
official of the U.S. intelligence service, the CIA. 
  Stanislav Devaty told a CESKY DENIK correspondent: "In my 
post, I can only congratulate our U.S. colleagues on their great 
success. I must say that in all the time I have held this 
position, since August 1992, I have not come across a case that 
would be even remotely reminiscent of a CIA employee's 
defection. As a citizen, I am distressed by the confirmation of 
my concerns that even under the new circumstances Russia has not 
changed its approach to the objects of its interest. The head 
of Russian intelligence, Primakov, recently said that the Czech 
Republic's place in Russia's sphere of certain interests does 
not mean that Russia conducts activity against the interest or 
laws of our country. In view of what has happened, I am not 
certain whether this statement of his can be trusted."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Mlejnek: "Czech and NATO Interests"] </F>
  [Text] The most recent statements by Russian officials, 
whether President Yeltsin or Foreign Minister Kozyrev, have 
confirmed the Russian veto on the Central Europe countries' 
joining NATO and reopened the issue of Czech security. The 
word "reopen" is not the correct word because the problem has 
been constantly open since November 1989. Certain incorrigible 
optimists, lulled by the Partnership for Peace bait, have 
realized the urgency of the problem in view of these statements. 
Not only they have realized it. The most recent Russian 
"offensive" in the Balkans has shown to us that the Russian 
position as a world power is beginning to assume a giant 
dimension once again. 
  The countries of Central Europe are afraid, understandably, 
and will probably seek a protective wing in Western 
institutions. They will use the Partnership for Peace as a 
shield (has anyone in Prague tried to find out why Russian 
Foreign Minister Kozyrev is so happy about the project?) and 
will speak about common values and sovereignty, which no one can 
allegedly violate. They still see NATO as the principal 
prospective defender of their security and sovereignty. 
However, the situation in the Balkans has shown us NATO with 
its pants down, weak, and rusty. Greece, a full NATO member, 
has not used its right to veto the "warning air strikes," but it 
refused to participate in any of the Alliance's actions. 
Moreover, it has conducted policy that has supported Russia 
rather than Brussels. We cannot have any objections--if 
Greece's temporary break with NATO is worth it, Athens must have 
a good reason for its behavior. (Or they may believe that they 
have such a reason, with is even more important.) This reason 
is national, or state interests. The same applies to Turkey, 
which threatened to leave the pact if the air strikes were not 
launched. What can we infer from that? The state interests of 
individual countries are above the interests of the Alliance 
itself. Not only in the Balkans' case. On the basis of that 
example, we can surmise that other member countries could behave 
in a similar way if a potential conflict applied to them as the 
Balkans' conflict applies to Greece and Turkey. The old common 
enemy has disappeared, and a new one is still to appear inasmuch 
as the neoimperialist Russia is definitely not an enemy to the 
West. 
  The interests of the NATO members, mainly of the United 
States as NATO's main driving force, are aimed at cooperating 
with Moscow. In the West, they are happy that Moscow can secure 
peace and order in Uzbekistan and Tadjikistan, and that it will 
stop the dangerous disintegration of the immense space of the 
former Soviet Union. The state interests of the United States 
itself were shifted to Southeast Asia a long time ago. Here, in 
that region, Washington is very concerned about becoming a 
direct ally of Moscow. It is definitely not in NATO's interest 
to confront Russia, much less on behalf of Central Europe. 
  The Czech Republic wants to get under "NATO's protective 
umbrella" as protection against the threat from the East. What 
follows from that? It is a simple and, for us, an unpleasant 
fact. The Czech Republic's and NATO's interests are outright 
disparate. This is one additional reason why it would be naive 
to think about joining NATO at this very moment. However, not 
all of the Czech and Western interests are so incompatible, but 
this is not enough to help us become a member in the Western 
security structures. The Czech Republic has common interests 
also with its neighbors and quasi-neighbors, who are more 
affected by the Russian threat than Paris or Amsterdam, for 
instance. We must quickly abandon our illusions, the old 
cliches. We must analyze the new situation with a cool head and 
respond to it appropriately. We do not have much time, but it 
may not be too late, either--let us hope.

<F P=106> [CTK report: "The Army Is Selling Arms, but It Is a Secret </F>
to Whom and for How Much"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Czech Army, which has the obligation to 
reduce its arsenal under international treaties, is either 
destroying its excess arms or selling them to Czech companies or 
abroad. 
  The Defense Ministry told MLADA FRONTA DNES that it had sold 
over 20,000 pistols through selected commercial firms last year, 
plus 13 combat planes, four armored vehicles, and two 
helicopters. 
  The ministry declined to provide details on where and for 
how 
much the technology was sold because that is a trade secret. 
According to Bretislav Gregr, director of the Ministry of 
Industry and Trade Licensing Administration, the technology that 
the Army sold is mostly nonfunctional. 
  The trading company Omnipol, for instance, sold two combat 
planes to Austria. They were a Soviet-made MiG 21-F and an L-29 
jet of domestic production. A MiG-15 from the Army arsenal was 
sold to Britain, and two OT-65 armored transporters from Army 
inventory were sold to the Netherlands. In all cases, the 
buyers were collectors--reportedly. 
  Omnipol also wanted to sell, from the Czech Army surplus, 
several thousand CZ-52 pistols to Canada and the United States. 
The deal did not materialize, however. 
  Two helicopters that were sold last year were bought by a 
domestic company, and the machines have not left the Czech 
Republic. 
  Apart from the military material that was sold, the Army has 
destroyed 583 combat armored vehicles, 28 aircraft, 606 tanks, 
and 621 artillery systems. Combat technology has been destroyed 
according to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe 
and the Vienna Treaty on Conventional Arms Reduction since 1992.

<F P=106> [Article by "(sim, ina)": "Harvard Funds Are a Family </F>
Business Run by Kozeny"] 
  [Text] Viktor Kozeny, as president of Harvard Capital and 
Consulting, represents, within this company, the interests of 
the majority owner of the shares. According to Boris Vostry, 
company vice president for foreign operations, Kozeny can 
directly influence events in the company without having to 
change the members in its supreme bodies and without being a 
member of the board. 
  Even after his resignation from the board, Kozeny remained 
in 
the five-member executive committee, which operatively controls 
Harvard Capital and Consulting. 
  "Harvard is Kozeny's family business, and speculations about 
his position are therefore irrelevant," Vostry said. The fact 
that Viktor Kozeny resigned from the Harvard Capital and 
Consulting board has changed nothing regarding his position of 
majority owner of the firm, Vostry added. Officially, it is 
impossible to precisely verify the property situation in Harvard 
funds because their shares are not tradable, and this 
information is protected by law. According to a source from 
another privatization fund, who did not want his name to be 
revealed because he wanted to avoid possible problems, Kozeny 
owns the majority of the shares, and another part (of the 
company) is controlled by his grandfather, Frantisek Stehlik. 
  Kozeny, he affirms, has resigned from the board for health 
reasons. Ivan Kralik, a former employee of the Presidential 
Office of Husak [Czechoslovak president under the communist 
regime] and a member of the company's board, has been entrusted 
with chairing the board. Kralik also worked at the Castle for a 
certain time after Havel assumed office.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "Slovakia" column: "An </F>
Interesting Offer to NATO"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar 
offered the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) the use of military 
exercise facilities on the territory of Slovakia. Ondrej Hanko, 
director of the Slovak Government Press Department, disclosed 
this after a meeting between Prime Minister Meciar and Gebhardt 
von Moltke, NATO deputy secretary general for political affairs. 
Von Moltke heads a NATO delegation that is currently in 
Slovakia discussing the military and political aspects of Slovak 
participation in the Partnership for Peace project. 
  Furthermore, the prime minister informed his guest about a 
new plan for Slovak Army exercises that also assumes joint 
exercises with the armies of the Alliance member countries. The 
offer of the use of military exercise facilities was accepted 
favorably by von Moltke, Hanko said, and added that the 
high-ranking official of the Alliance appreciated the "rapid and 
unequivocal" union with the project on the part of Slovakia. 
The prime minister also proposed that a NATO school be 
established in Slovakia that would serve not only the Visegrad 
Four countries but also other countries interested in joining 
the Alliance.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar by Jan </F>
Smolec; place and date not given: "We Will Not Be the Armory of 
the World, but..."] 
  [Text] [Smolec] Mr. Prime Minister, during the past few 
days, you have held meetings with politicians and businessmen in 
Moscow, Tashkent, Beijing, Shanghai, Bangkok, Karachi, and 
Ankara. This was a journey of 25,000 kilometers. From where do 
you have the best reports? 
  [Meciar] We have good reports from each country, but the 
most important ones are, in any case, from China. We were 
received by President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. The 
signing of an agreement on trade-economic and cultural 
cooperation opens up a huge market for Slovakia. This giant 
country appreciated the fact that Slovakia was one of the first 
countries in East Europe to come and discuss cooperation with 
the PRC. 
  [Smolec] Ill-wishers are accusing you of flirting with a 
socialist country, are they not? 
  [Meciar] The whole world trades with the People's Republic 
of China. China was the first of the Asian countries to 
recognize us as a state. There are no contentious issues 
between us. China has a dominant economic-strategic position in 
Asia. It is undergoing a complicated transformation process. 
In Shanghai, they are quite literally achieving a minor 
economic miracle. We want to learn from what the Chinese are 
doing. What China does well, we want to take up ourselves. I 
do not pay any attention to what the ill-wishers say. 
  [Smolec] In China, Thailand, Pakistan, and Turkey, you 
shrewdly pointed out to politicians and businessmen that 
Slovakia was once a "power" in arms production. Now it is 
producing only 8 percent of its original output. We had 
politicians who forced us to repent for having experts who 
manufactured high-quality weapons. 
  [Meciar] Others have come into the arms markets we left. We 
are offering these products to NATO. No agreements were reached 
with Germany or France; on the other hand, they reached an 
agreement with the Czech Republic. We did not come to an 
agreement with Great Britain. So, we are looking for ways of 
cooperating with others. For example, with Turkey, Thailand, and 
other countries. World experts admire the technical standard of 
Slovak weapons because, in some respects, it is unique. We do 
not want to turn Slovakia into the world's armory, but we see no 
need to destroy our arms industry. It is important that we are 
able to compete. We have to make up quickly for the loss we 
suffered through no fault of our own. The tradition of our 
products means a lot. Very few people know that the cannon that 
Columbus fired when he discovered America was made in Upper 
Hungary--that is, on the territory of present-day Slovakia. 
  [Smolec] During your trip, did anyone express any doubts 
about Slovakia? 
  [Meciar] The Slovak Republic was viewed everywhere we went 
as a reliable and responsible partner. They did not know much 
about us in Pakistan, but, when we told them about Slovakia, 
they expressed an interest in visiting it.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu was in Bratislava today on a one-day visit to Slovakia. 
[passage omitted] Our editor Ivo Kunsch was present at a news 
briefing at which the Slovak and Romanian prime ministers 
answered journalists' questions. 
  [Kunsch] [passage omitted] Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu commented on the signing of agreements: 
  [Vacaroiu in Romanian fading into Slovak report read by 
Kunsch] We have continued in Bratislava today what we started 
during Prime Minister's Meciar's visit in Bucharest last year. 
It is especially good that we are discussing all problems 
openly and sincerely, but, at the same time, we very strictly 
oversee that all of what we have agreed to becomes reality. 
Today, more than seven months since Prime Minister's Meciar's 
visit to Bucharest, we can say that we have made progress in all 
aspects. However, the most important fact is that we have 
almost completed the legislative framework needed to get 
bilateral relations between traders on a higher level. We 
envisage that several meetings will be held at both governmental 
and parliamentary levels this year. Slovakia is the second 
country with which Romania signed a memorandum on trade 
liberalization. 
  [Kunsch] So much for the Romanian prime minister's comment 
on 
the signed agreements. Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar 
also talked about this important event. He said Romania and 
Slovakia had completed the part of contractual obligations that 
were necessary for trade cooperation of a simple type. Talks on 
the transition to free trade have started already today, and the 
drafting of agreements will begin shortly. It is a matter for 
the teams of experts and a question of how soon they will 
prepare the conditions. The political will is to have this as 
soon as possible. 
  The Romanian prime minister was also received by Ivan 
Gasparovic, chairman of parliament, and Slovak President Michal 
Kovac. Nicolae Vacaroiu left Bratislava shortly before 
"Radiozurnal" [this news bulletin] went on the air.

June"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--"I think it is admirable that Mr. Kohl 
has expressed an opinion on something about which he does not 
think it necessary to ascertain the actual facts; this 
underscores the credibility of his point of view," said V. 
Meciar following the coalition talks between the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia and the Slovak National Party [SNS] in reply 
to a question from SME on what he thinks of the view expressed 
by A. Kohl, secretary general of the European Democratic Union, 
who feels that holding a referendum on the deputies' mandates is 
incompatible with Slovakia's membership in the Council of Europe. 
  According to Meciar, the need to stabilize the situation and 
to resolve the current political crisis was discussed at the 
coalition talks. The two parties agreed to fundamental talks 
with the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] on the means of 
achieving stability. He also pointed out that it was necessary 
to take into consideration the forceful protest from 
representatives of the Association of Slovak Towns and 
Communities against holding local and national elections at the 
same time and the view expressed by more than 400,000 citizens 
that all three issues be resolved by a referendum. "It is in the 
interests of the state to hold the elections as soon as 
possible. The optimum date seems to us to be 24-25 June, but 
our two parties do not have enough votes to push this through 
parliament. Therefore, we need to negotiate with other 
political parties," said the prime minister. He added that "we 
have agreed with the SDL that both parties will hold talks with 
it." 
  SNS Chairman Jan Slota said that the date of the early 
elections is the most important thing. He said that, for the 
SNS, "the most suitable time is June. For this reason, it is 
necessary to strive to ensure at all costs that the elections 
are held in June, and, if the Slovak part of the SDL decides to 
support them, we will be very pleased." He specified what he 
meant by the Slovak part of the SDL as follows: "You would have 
to look among those deputies and see. There are enough ethnic 
Hungarian deputies there and, perhaps, also deputies of other 
nationalities. In this part of the SDL, the majority are 
Slovaks." 
  In reaction to the possibility that no agreement will be 
reached in parliament, V. Meciar said that, in this case, the 
citizens will have to decide because "such a loss of time leads 
to a decline in credits and a decline in investments, the 
state's economic interests are harmed, and the laws that can 
help the economy cannot be passed." 
  According to the prime minister, the petition questions and 
the referendum do not only concern whether a deputy can make a 
free decision when laws are being determined, but also whether 
the citizen has the right to supervise a deputy's activity. The 
statements made by the Christian Democratic Union "are, in this 
regard, a distortion of the situation; they do not correspond to 
the political, legal, or actual situation, and I believe that it 
will be necessary, to say the least, to draft a new electoral 
law," added the prime minister.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "According To Slovak National Party Chairman </F>
J. Slota, Slovaks Must Struggle To Ensure That `No Minority 
Hinders the State-Forming Nation'"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--According to Slovak National Party 
[SNS] Chairman Jan Slota, it would be best for Slovakia if early 
parliamentary elections were held in June. 
  He also said that the "Bolsheviks" from the Party of the 
Democratic Left [SDL] are trying to push back the date of the 
elections as far as possible so that "they can reveal how they 
will come again in the role of apostles and redeem this 
country." He commented that "they redeemed it like this once 
before, in 1948, and now they are preparing to do so again." J. 
Slota is of the opinion that the communists and Bolsheviks, as 
he calls the SDL members, are responsible for Slovakia's current 
economic situation. The SNS chairman unreservedly supports the 
drive for a petition and holding a referendum on all three 
questions. 
  The SNS does not see priority in its activity being given to 
the economic sphere because its aims are national ones. J. 
Slota emphasized that there is also a social subtext in this 
"national" aspect, and he added that "we Slovaks must struggle 
to ensure that we all get on well and that this state-forming 
nation is not endangered by any minority." The SNS would like 
the state's defense to be oriented toward maintaining its 
territorial integrity and the inviolability of its borders. The 
SNS is in favor of the Slovak Army achieving combat readiness 
"so that we can be sure that we have something to defend 
ourselves with," he said. Another SNS priority is culture. 
"Here we would like to take a look at the funds given to the 
Hungarian press and culture, while, at the same time, our 
Slovaks in South Slovakia are disregarded," said Slota. 
According to him, the Hungarian minority in the Slovak Republic 
has above-average rights. He said that they are constantly 
bringing relations [between the communities] to a head. He 
pointed out that "the Hungarians and the smallest ethnic 
minority (the Jews) have a strong lobby here and that they are 
against Slovakia. Perhaps, they have different aims for 
Slovakia, aims at variance with those of the SNS," he added. 
  Jan Slota would not refuse the post of defense minister if 
it 
were offered to him. However, he does not want this fact to be 
associated with his attacks on Defense Minister Andrejcak. He 
added that Andrejcak is only supported in his post by the former 
political instructors and members of the Communist Party of 
Slovakia Central Committee and Communist Party of Czechoslovakia 
Central Committee whom he has left in the Army.

  [Excerpts] I am Slota the terrible! I am the new chairman 
of the Slovak National Party [SNS]! This is how the SNS 
chairman welcomed journalists at the party's regular news 
conference today. [passage omitted] After the news conference, 
Jan Slota spoke to our correspondent Lydia Mrazova. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Mrazova] Mr. Chairman, in an interview 
for 
the SLOVENSKY NAROD newspaper, you said that your members and 
sympathizers were aware of the danger threatening the Slovak 
Republic. "Danger" is a very serious term that can hide 
anything. What, then, is your interpretation of danger in 
current politics? 
  [Slota] I understand the term "danger" as two distinct 
dangers. On the one hand, as the communist danger, and, on the 
other, as a danger from the south. As regards the former, I 
wish to stress that it would be very dangerous if Slovaks 
supported left-wing parties because, in 1948, this danger was 
also underestimated. Perhaps not so much in Slovakia, but, all 
the same, eventually communism was planted in Slovakia, too, and 
we know very well what sort of time followed, the 1950's and all 
that. So the Slovaks should not forget the past. 
  As regards the latter, the south, well, anyone who does not 
wish to see will not see. But we, SNS members, really do see 
how Slovaks in the south of Slovakia, the very people whose 
state and territory this is, find themselves in a position of an 
ethnic minority. Slovaks are afraid and migrate to the north. 
In a word, they are afraid to assert themselves as Slovaks.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Foreign Minister Jozef </F>
Moravcik by SMENA correspondent (bg) in Bratislava on 25 
February: "It Is a Long Way to the President"] 
  [Text] Jozef Moravcik, who submitted his resignation to 
President Michal Kovac on Wednesday [23 February], gave a 
briefing at the Foreign Ministry yesterday for "select" members 
of the media. He discussed many domestic and foreign policy 
issues. We have selected the most important questions and 
answers. J. Moravcik said the following in connection with our 
image abroad: 
  "Foreign countries are monitoring our situation very 
carefully, and one thing is becoming clear to them from our 
domestic political situation--a trend toward the introduction of 
certain elements of an authoritarian regime. This is one 
negative factor. If this were confirmed--and I have the 
impression that current political developments are confirming 
these forecasts--we would thus create for ourselves an 
unfavorable position for our integration into Europe. Another 
factor is the quite frequent ambiguity of the statements made by 
certain politicians, first and foremost of whom is the prime 
minister. This all creates a less than perfect image for the 
"legibility" of our domestic policy. This, of course, in turn 
also influences the conclusions that foreign countries come to 
as far as their relations with our country are concerned." 
  [Question] Mr. Minister, you have said that you do not want 
to cause any problems for the president by your 
resignation--that is, problems with regard to relations between 
the government and the Castle. Could you expand on this? 
  [Moravcik] I was mainly emphasizing that it is necessary to 
deal speedily with the issue of appointing a new minister. This 
is in the interest of the Slovak Republic, which I consider to 
be the most important thing. It is not expedient, within the 
framework of Slovakia's foreign policy interests, to prolong 
such a state of uncertainty. So, this was my main reason for 
submitting my resignation. 
  [Question] It seems to me that the Slovak foreign minister 
is viewed as follows: Either he is good but not loyal, or he is 
loyal but not good. Do you think Slovakia needs a good foreign 
minister or a loyal one? 
  [Moravcik] I think Slovakia needs a minister who is, despite 
everything, capable of asserting the Republic's foreign policy 
interests, interests that are specified objectively and 
geopolitically. There is sufficient support for this in 
parliament; our foreign policy line was formulated with the 
participation of all of the political entities. The foreign 
minister should respect this and he should assert this line. 
  [Question] In this case, must he end up like Milan Knazko 
and you? 
  [Moravcik] It is necessary to create the domestic political 
conditions so that this does not happen. I feel that we are 
going through a period in which the domestic political situation 
is preventing us, to a broad extent, from implementing our 
foreign policy interests. 
  [Question] Could you explain why the visit to Bratislava by 
your Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev, has twice been 
postponed? 
  [Moravcik] The two sides agreed that they would portray the 
postponement of this visit as a mutual decision. 
  [Question] Will you be able to give us more details when you 
are no longer in office? 
  [Moravcik] I must respect Slovakia's interests abroad, even 
when I am no longer foreign minister. 
  [SMENA correspondent] In reply to a question on the future 
orientation of Slovak foreign policy, Minister Moravcik said the 
following: 
  "The orientation of our foreign policy evolved on the basis 
of a general consensus; it has support in parliament. If 
someone were to want to alter it, he would obviously meet with 
resistance in parliament. For this reason, I think that the 
fundamental line of our foreign policy should and will be 
maintained." 
  [Question] Andreas Kohl, general secretary of the European 
Democratic Union, has said that holding a referendum on the 
withdrawal of mandates from deputies in parliament is at 
variance with all norms and democratic criteria and incompatible 
with Slovakia's membership in the Council of Europe. In your 
opinion, what could the real repercussions of this situation be? 
  [Moravcik] I agree with this assessment; this would really 
be a considerable step backward. The principle proposed in the 
referendum is incompatible with the political thinking in 
democratic Europe and is incompatible with the 
parliamentarianism that has evolved in Europe over several 
centuries. This is a well tried system, and such an element, if 
we were to introduce it, would mean its destruction. 
  [Question] So you think it is possible that Slovakia could 
be expelled from the Council of Europe? 
  [Moravcik] I think it is likely that this would be 
discussed. 
  [Question] Mr. Minister, in your opinion, is the 
nonappointment of ambassadors in key Slovak embassies the fault 
of the Foreign Ministry or were the "brakes applied," in this 
context, outside the ministry? 
  [Moravcik] This is a very complicated situation. If the 
ministry itself had decided on the appointment of ambassadors, 
all of the posts would have been filled long ago. However, a 
consensus among three entities--the Foreign Ministry, the 
government, and the president--is necessary for this. 
  [Question] Where did it get "tied up" most? 
  [Moravcik] It is a very long way from the ministry to the 
president. 
  [Question] Mr. Minister, you are obviously thinking about 
establishing a new political entity. In this context, I would 
like to ask you whether an alliance with--I will say this very 
pejoratively--the so-called turncoats from the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia and the Slovak National Party is possible. 
  [Moravcik] We will try to consolidate all of the forces 
oriented toward the center of the political spectrum, including 
Cernak's National Democratic Party and the Alliance of Slovak 
Democrats, and, as the case may be, we will also seek other 
entities. We are thinking about a possible coalition, not a 
merger, with the social democrats, under the condition that they 
progress more to the center of the political spectrum. That is 
the basis. In addition, we will also look for other ways of 
involving, if possible, some important personalities in 
political life, people who have such an inclination. I think 
that a strong center bloc could provide the basis for domestic 
political stability in Slovakia. 
  [Question] You say "we." Can you tell us who this is? 
  [Moravcik] Those of us who came up with the Alternative for 
Political Realism initiative are keeping in touch. 
  [Question] Would you like to go into the elections as a bloc 
with these entities? 
  [Moravcik] It would be ideal if a common entity were to come 
into being and if a merger were to take place. If this does not 
happen, we would consider it effective and expedient, at least, 
to form such a bloc, which means an electoral coalition. 
  [Question] Classified material was discussed at a government 
session a few weeks ago. It was submitted by Deputy Prime 
Minister Sergej Kozlik, and, according to some reports from the 
lobbies, it dealt with Slovakia's geopolitical position. Could 
you be more specific about this material? 
  [Moravcik] It is classified material, which means I cannot 
make public its contents; however, I can venture to express an 
opinion on it. It is so naive and imperfect that it cannot be 
utilized. It is muddled, and, in my opinion, there is no point 
in discussing it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak by an </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "We Know 
How To Defend Our Sovereignty"] 
  [Text] [REPUBLIKA] You will put forward the Slovak 
Defense Doctrine at the government session. What does this 
document mean for Slovakia? 
  [Andrejcak] The defense doctrine is an umbrella document 
containing the principle issues of our defense philosophy. This 
means that it does not deal with the way soldiers defend our 
homeland but with the way the state approaches defense issues, 
how it will defend its sovereignty, and how our defense policy 
will be formulated. I think that the defense doctrine 
guarantees all of this. 
  [REPUBLIKA] Is this not a bit late? Virtually a year after 
the state's establishment? 
  [Andrejcak] Not at all. After all, countries like the 
United States and Great Britain do not have a defense doctrine 
like this, and they have been around for quite a while. This is 
a form that makes public the substance of the Slovak Republic's 
defense principles. The military part, however, is specific, 
but that is strictly classified in every country. 
  [REPUBLIKA] A great deal was once said about a home guard, 
but the public, in general, was not inclined toward it. What is 
the situation today? 
  [Andrejcak] We actually have a home guard. We have home 
guard brigades and home guard regiments; however, we will assign 
them only in the event of a defense emergency. The home guard 
units are part of the ground forces. 
  [REPUBLIKA] When will the Slovak Defense Doctrine be 
regarded as an official document? Does it have to be approved 
by parliament? 
  [Andrejcak] It would be enough for it to be approved by the 
State Defense Council, and that has already happened. However, 
if parliament also wants to approve it, there is nothing 
preventing this. The National Council of the Slovak Republic 
committees have already discussed and approved it. However, it 
is already an official document because the State Defense 
Council has approved it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky by Martin </F>
Kovacs; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Kovacs] How do you evaluate the chances of a 
settlement in Bosnia in light of the agreement between the 
Croats and Muslims yesterday? 
  [Jeszenszky] Well, unfortunately, one has to be cautious 
because there have already been so many agreements in that 
region in the past which have not been kept. However, I hope 
that this will be adhered to, for it is of vital importance for 
both parties. Since this very significant agreement has been 
concluded after this tragic and bloody war, this indicates a 
very serious political intention. Another element also has to 
be emphasized in the agreement: the Croats and Muslims have also 
agreed that they will not try to create two ethnically pure 
Croat and Muslim Bosnias. The fact that the communities will 
have cultural autonomy while the joint affairs of state will be 
run together is a very good model. 
  [Kovacs] You had talks today with the U.S. defense secretary 
and secretary of state. Did they ask you about the Hungarian 
position regarding Yugoslavia? Did they ask for any kind of 
explanation? 
  [Jeszenszky] No, they did not ask for any explanation and 
there is no need for that. The Hungarian position was known to 
them already. I did, however, use the opportunity to illuminate 
Hungary's special position; that is, our closeness and to a 
certain extent our vulnerability and the vulnerability of the 
Hungarians of Vojvodina. Finally, the conclusion was that the 
United States sees Hungary's special concerns, but it also sees 
that Hungary has consistently pursued the policies of the past 
three and a half years. Our policy in the Yugoslav question is 
quite unequivocal: we support a settlement, we want peace, and 
this peace should be the fairest possible. [passage omitted] 
  Hungary's foreign policy is balanced; Hungary gives 
humanitarian aid to Vojvodina but also to the Serbs living 
there. Hungary accepts Bosnian refugees and Hungary is forming 
a new friendly relationship with Croatia, reviving traditions 
going back centuries. We are confirming these with talks also. 
I visited Belgrade in January and I am planning to visit Zagreb 
and Sarajevo also in the near future. So Hungary is able to 
form good relations with every one of the parties -- to varying 
degrees, naturally -- and this is in accordance with the will 
and expectations of the international community. 
  [Kovacs] Did you have an opportunity or was there a need to 
talk about the AWACS planes using Hungary's air space? 
  [Jeszenszky] There were no need for talks about this. We are 
in continuous contact with NATO and I know what kind of useful 
information we receive from these planes. The planes' mandates 
are unchanged. [passage omitted] 
  [Kovacs] The U.S. State Department has carried out its 
annual 
analysis of human rights in every country. This analysis also 
contained critical elements in connection with Hungary. Did you 
react to these critical elements? Did you discuss this at all? 
  [Jeszenszky] These were not mentioned and this itself 
indicates that these critical elements are not serious enough to 
create concern in the Government of the United States. As long 
as this report is much less critical of Hungary than, let us 
say, of Great Britain, I am not worried. Having said that, 
there are certain points in this report which do not correspond 
entirely to the situation in Hungary, or they are rather 
one-sided, and we shall respond to these at the appropriate 
level proving precisely the real situation, so we did not have 
to discuss this issue at this level.

  [Text] A total of 129 employees of Hungarian Radio have 
been dismissed or pensioned off. According to a statement by 
[Hungarian Radio Vice President] Laszlo Csucs, their names will 
not be published to respect their personal rights. In his 
statement issued by MTI, the vice president supported the idea 
of unbiased public service activity. We quote: 
  The transformation of the system is under way in Hungary and 
Hungarian Radio cannot avoid this either. The State Audit 
Office's investigation, which was carried out in 1992, drew top 
officials' attention to several shortcomings, though it found 
financial matters in order. Hungarian Radio prepared a plan of 
measures that included a plan to reduce overly high staff 
numbers, which stood at over 2,000 people. 
  According to Csucs's statement, decisions on redundancies 
were not based on political, but professional and ethical 
criteria; that is, Hungarian Radio dismissed those who did not 
meet these criteria, the vice president's statement reads.

  [Text] Some Hungarian Radio employees who have not been 
sacked have started a petition for they consider that an 
unequivocal political cleansing has taken place in the 
institution. 
  In their opinion, the often mentioned surplus of staff does 
not justify the dismissal of prestigious, experienced, and 
well-known editors and reporters on the pretext of financial 
difficulties and organizational restructuring. These staff 
members -- who are unaffected by the dismissals and have joined 
the employees' protest -- emphasize that they wish to serve the 
radio listeners. Thus they will remain [in the institution] to 
carry out the work as long as possible. 
  They think it important to let everybody know that they 
consider these events outrageous. They express their solidarity 
with those sacked and they hope that soon they will be able to 
work together in Hungarian Radio again.

<F P=106> [Interview with Janos Martonyi, state secretary at the </F>
Foreign Ministry, by Gabor Lambert and Lajos Pietsch; place and 
date not given: "There Should Not Be a Domestic Political 
Debate on the Membership -- Interview With Janos Martonyi on Our 
Application for EU Membership"] 
  [Excerpts] [MAGYAR NEMZET] On 1 March in Bonn, Prime 
Minister Peter Boross announced that our application for 
European Union [EU] membership will be submitted in April. Why 
this haste, and what do we expect from this step? 
  [Martonyi] First about the haste. The idea of the 
application for membership first emerged when former Prime 
Minister Jozsef Antall visited Brussels. Unfortunately, the 
association agreement came into force later than we had expected 
because of the delay in the process of ratification. Finally, 
it came into force on 1 February, which put the issue of full 
membership on the agenda. The other element of all this is that 
work on an expert level has been going on for a long time and we 
have drawn up the government's integration policy. It was clear 
from the beginning that, in this integration strategy, one of 
the questions -- although not necessarily the most important one 
-- is the timing of the application for membership. All I am 
really trying to say is that this process started a long time 
ago, and domestic political considerations had nothing to do 
with it. I can state this very definitely. 
  In our view, this application has to be submitted now. We 
would lose at least two years if we waited until 1996, when the 
inter- governmental conference on the future of the Union is 
held. We must not do this, the deadline of the year 2000 is 
very important for us. We have always emphasized that the 
association agreement was a stage on the way to full membership. 
If we do not continue on this road, and stop at an intermediate 
stage, then I am convinced that we will find ourselves in an 
unfavorable situation in 2001-2002. [passage omitted] 
  [MAGYAR NEMZET] Was the selection of the timing influenced 
by a subjective element, namely it seems that the current French 
minister for European affairs [Alain Lamassoure] seems to be 
more positive about Hungarian membership than his predecessors? 
  [Martonyi] Indeed, as far as I know, Lamassoure was the 
first one to verify in the press the Hungarian intention to 
submit the application for membership. He also said -- what we 
also know -- that the Central and Eastern European countries 
have to be placed on an equal basis politically, but the 
political, economic, and legal criteria of membership have to be 
defined. It will be possible to differentiate between the 
candidate countries on the basis of these criteria. This is the 
essence of Lamassoure's view. In my view, this is basically 
favorable for us. [passage omitted] 
  [MAGYAR NEMZET] Can we hope that, after the association 
agreement becoming effective and submitting our application for 
membership, our integration into Europe can be speeded up in 
other areas, too? 
  [Martonyi] This is indeed an important connection. In 
addition to what we have already mentioned, it also has to be 
seen that one of the roles of the membership application is that 
it forces both sides (us and the Union) to face up to our 
historical responsibility. We can do one thing, namely force 
the other side to make decisions and to give answers. This is 
something that is very important. If we want to gain the status 
of official candidate, then we force the European Union to give 
an answer. We feel that we can also contribute to the thought 
process that has now begun in preparation for the 1996 
conference, and the subject of this is what kind of Europe we 
want: A more united, efficient, and democratic Europe, or are 
we envisaging a different kind of integration. At the moment, 
the debate is on what status the European Union's associate 
members should have in the West European Union. I always say 
that we have to try to further the whole process, and rather 
than forging ahead as an arrowhead, we want to move forward 
along the whole front. Therefore, I believe that we have to see 
the connections between the various goals. Unfortunately, we 
also have to mention that, here and now, in the Eastern European 
situation, the elements of unpredictability and uncertainty are 
present and only certain indications of these have surfaced for 
the time being; and I believe that this whole issue is also a 
factor that speeds up integration. The Balladur plan can also 
be one of these factors. One of the reasons I say that we would 
like a united Union is because I believe that this is the only 
solution to the Hungarian national dilemma: On one hand, 
transferring a significant part of national sovereignty to the 
Union and a broader application of subsidiarity on the other, 
which can also help increase the independence of local 
communities. This has preconditions, and a long and slow 
process is needed here because Eastern-Central Europe cannot 
forget its history and tensions overnight. In my view, the 
Balladur plan has a chance if it tries to help in this. This is 
very difficult and has to face many obstacles and mistrust, and 
this includes the Hungarian side. Naturally, we are also afraid 
that the plan will finally change in such a way that it loses it 
original essence, namely that we have to find a solution to the 
national minority issue by listening to the minorities and 
allowing national minority rights to prevail. This is the 
essence of the issue. In addition to this, we can also talk 
about everything. The success of the plan will not depend on 
us. Undoubtedly, if the Balladur plan is implemented, then this 
will be a step towards EU membership for all countries. 
  [MAGYAR NEMZET] Which institution will coordinate the 
Hungarian actions toward the Union after the application is 
submitted? How will we attune our economic and other 
legislation with the European Union's legal provisions? 
  [Martonyi] We already have the answer to this, namely Law 
No. 1 of 1994, which announced our association agreement, 
contains a second and a third paragraph stating that, on one 
hand, the associate agreement has to be taken into account when 
making international agreements and, on the other -- and this is 
more important -- the requirements of coordination and 
conformity with the Union's laws have to be taken into 
consideration in all future Hungarian legislation. As an 
institution, I believe that the basic responsibility belongs to 
the Hungarian Parliament. A parliamentary decision is needed to 
submit the membership application -- from a legal point of view, 
this is actually the initiation of an international agreement. 
This undoubtedly comes under Parliament's sphere of authority. 
Parliament will also have to decide on specially important 
issues in the future. In addition to this, the executive power 
is responsible for carrying the whole process, in cooperation 
and coordination with Parliament and its committees. Statements 
of a domestic political nature have indeed appeared in the 
press. I am asking all participants -- if I may put it this way 
-- not to create a domestic political issue out of this, on 
either side. This is a fundamental interest and it has to be 
completed; if it is supported by all parties then it is 
everyone's merit and responsibility, and it should be accepted 
with a near unanimous parliamentary decision. I note that this 
would also be very favorable for the assessment of the 
application because we have always presented this as a national 
consensus. I believe that we have been justified in doing so 
because we have always agreed on the essence of this issue with 
all parties.

  [Text] Brussels, March 4 (AFP) -- The four planes shot 
down earlier this week by NATO jets over Bosnia-Herzegovina had 
taken off from south Croatia's rebel Serb enclave of Krajina, 
NATO military officials said Friday. Two other Serb aircraft 
which were not attacked in the same incident probably took off 
from the Serb-controlled town of Banja Luka in northern Bosnia, 
officials added. 
  The report confirmed a statement earlier in the day by 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. The four Bosnian Serb 
Super-Galeb planes bombed a military plant at Bugojno and a 
residential area northwest of the factory before they were shot 
down by two US F-16 fighters, according to a NATO report cited 
by the officials. The bombings occurred after the F-16 ordered 
the Serbs to land. 
  The two other Super-Galeb probably bombed an ammunition 
plant 
and a fuel depot at Novi Travnik in central Bosnia, the report 
added. One of the two aircraft probably landed at Ubdina in 
Krajina, and the other at Banja Luka. 
  They had been spotted by the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization's AWACS radar planes near Banja Luka and were later 
visually recognized by the F-16 pilots. 
  NATO officials had earlier identified the aircraft as 
Super-Galeb bombers belonging to the Bosnian Serbs but the NATO 
report made no mention of the plane's origin. No parachutes 
were spotted after the four planes were shot down, so the fate 
of the Super-Galeb pilots was unknown, the report said. 
  Tudjman, in a meeting in Zagreb with special United Nations 
representative Yasushi Akashi, complained that UN forces 
monitoring Krajina were exercising "inadequate control." "The 
example of the Serb military planes that were shot down, and 
which had taken off from an area of Croatia under UN protection, 
proves it," Tudjman argued, according to the news agency HINA.

  [Excerpts] Vitez, Bosnia-Herzegovina, March 4 (AFP) -- The 
UN commander in Bosnia on Friday voiced "disappointment" over 
the lack of response to an urgent UN appeal for more troops in 
Bosnia and warned it could "make things fail." 
  "Obviously, it's a disappointment," said British Lieutenant 
General Michael Rose who Thursday [3 March] said his troops now 
were operating only "on a wing and a prayer." "I asked for at 
least 5,000 men, and if we assume that we are going to stay on 
here for months, obviously I need even more than that," he said. 
When asked how many reinforcements he had actually been 
promised, he said only "not many." [passage omitted] 
  Despite continuing peace efforts that have led to a Serb 
artillery pullback around Sarajevo and a separate US-brokered 
Moslem-Croat accord, Rose expressed concern. "There are 
difficulties, in some way increasing difficulties, in terms of 
ceasefire violations going on at the moment," he said without 
giving specifics. 
  He said the war continued in the central Bosnian city of 
Maglaj, where a tiny Moslem enclave is under attack by Bosnian 
Serb forces. The Bosnian Serbs have repeatedly refused to allow 
in an aid convoy with 100 tonnes of relief supplies for some 
19,000 residents trapped in the Moslem enclave in what are 
described as dire conditions. 
  "It's not an easy business. They are not giving us the 
freedom of movement we require. There is a war going on there 
in Maglaj. We're not in the business of imposing a peace through 
force," he said. [passage omitted] 
  Rose did not venture any date for when the airport in Tuzla, 
the Moslem enclave besieged by Serbs in northern Bosnia, would 
be reopened. The airport has been closed for more than a year 
but Bosnian Serbs agreed to allow its reopening for humanitarian 
shipments to the desperate surrounding region after Russia, a 
traditional Serb ally, offered to send observer troops there. 
  Rose said the airport's reopening now only depended on 
technical details. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic "has now 
accepted the reopening of the airport. It's just a question of 
looking into the mechanics, moving the observers up there and 
some extra troops. I don't think there is a problem, just a 
question of our own timing," he said. 
  Rose arrived in the central Bosnian town of Vitez, a Croat 
enclave besieged by the mainly Moslem Bosnian army, Thursday 
night to visit the British UN base there which notably houses 
the First Coldstream Guards. 
  Meanwhile, Brigadier-General Fikret Muslimovic of the 
Bosnian 
army, who negotiated the arrangements to be introduced Saturday, 
said that more international troops were needed to enforce the 
Moslem-Croat ceasefire. 
  Muslimovic, speaking by phone from Zenica in central Bosnia, 
said the UNPROFOR force was not large enough to keep the peace 
between Moslems and Croats, who are confronting each other over 
large tracts of territory. "It won't be possible," he said, if 
more troops do not come. 
  UNPROFOR has about 14,700 troops in Bosnia, 4,100 of them in 
Sarajevo where they are tied up enforcing a separate ceasefire 
between the Moslems and Serbs. 
  UN envoy for Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi said Thursday that 
10,000 more troops are needed but the United States has ruled 
out sending soldiers while France and Britain, with infantry 
already in Bosnia, are reluctant to provide more. 
  Muslimovic said Moslem-Croat fighting could end "if there is 
political will," but he added, "one thing is sure, that the 
number of (UN) troops now on the ground is not enough."

<F P=106> [Report by Anton Mrkonjic in Zepce] </F>
  [Excerpt] At 0635 this morning three 82-mm mortars fell on 
the British UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] base in the village 
of Ljeskovica, between Zepce and Zavidovici [central Bosnia, 
around 100 miles northwest of Sarajevo]. British forces 
commander Major Darling informed the command of the 111th HVO 
[Croatian Defense Council] Brigade that their radar equipment 
detected the direction and even the location from where the 
mortars were fired, but declined to say who was responsible for 
the shelling of the British battalion. Fortunately, there were 
no casualties, but material damage is huge. Maj. Darling said 
that if the shelling happens again he would demand air strikes 
against those who fire shells on UNPROFOR. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Jelena Vidic -- recorded] </F>
  [Text] [Vidic] President [of the Srpska republic] Karadzic 
assessed that the visit to Moscow was very significant and that 
the resolution of the Bosnian crisis will take a new direction. 
  He assessed that Russia's involvement in the search for a 
peaceful solution is of crucial importance and that the balance 
of powers has now been restored on the international scene. 
Russia is not returning to the international scene in the sense 
of confrontation with the West, but in the sense of a very 
active role in the process of searching for a solution to the 
crisis, Karadzic said and assessed that the Serbian side, as he 
said, has finally found somebody through whom it can articulate 
its views and point to what is totally unacceptable for it. 
  When we asked him whether we can now expect a concrete new 
Russian initiative regarding the conflict in Bosnia, Karadzic 
replied: 
  [Karadzic] I think that the Russians will work in sync with 
others. It seems to me that at least two moves so far -- 
Yeltsin's letter regarding heavy arms to [Serbian] President 
Milosevic and via him to me, and now this about the Tuzla 
airport -- have surprised western circles. It seems to me that 
Russia has accomplished a considerable advantage here, on the 
basis of which it can now take part in the resolution of the 
crisis on an equal footing. I expect and assume that meetings 
similar to those in Washington will also happen in Moscow. 
  [Vidic] Karadzic then commented the Washington agreement on 
the Muslim-Croatian confederation: 
  [Karadzic] We are still studying this agreement and we are 
not sure yet whether it has been struck at the expense of the 
Serbs or as a partial step toward peace. We fear any sort of 
Croatian-Muslim coalition, we remember them from World War II 
and from the beginning of this war, and for this reason we are 
very cautious. If they form a joint state then we must also 
take care of our territories and borders. They must be easily 
defendable in case this country, this neighbor, starts 
displaying hostile feelings toward us. In principle, we think 
that it is not good that the United States has assumed the role 
of the United Nations, and has taken the place of the 
international institutions, so to speak, with the great ambition 
of helping along an agreement of the Croats and Muslims only. I 
am afraid that the United States is missing another opportunity 
to portray itself as objective. Therefore, the impression of 
its partiality and orientation against the Serbian interests is 
strengthening. 
  [Vidic] The next steps of the Srpska republic will be to 
strengthen peace on all front lines in order to negotiate in the 
best possible atmosphere, Karadzic said. We will participate in 
all negotiations, however, we have reserves toward those who act 
as arbiters and neglect the significance of the Serbian side in 
this conflict. We will not allow the realization of the 
Croatian-Muslim coalition and joint state to the detriment of 
the Serbs, Karadzic emphasized. 
  Commenting on [Croatian Foreign Minister] Granic's 
invitation 
to the Serbs to enter the confederation, Karadzic said that the 
Croatian Minister should have said this in Belgrade and not in 
Paris. 
  Karadzic then replied to a question about the decision to 
open Tuzla airport: 
  [Karadzic] We have never opposed the opening of the airport 
for humanitarian purposes. Our fundamental concern was that the 
airport could be abused for military purposes. We have held 
very fruitful talks regarding this in Russia and received 
assurances that the arrangement that we had agreed with the 
Russians protects against any sort of misuse of the airport. In 
such a case, we have nothing against the opening of the airport.

  [Text] Belgrade, 3 Mar (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, said in a statement upon 
returning from Moscow that the settlement of the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina would from now on "take a completely 
different turn." During a news conference, the Srpska republic 
president said Russia's complete involvement in efforts to 
settle the crisis and the establishment of a balance of forces 
in the international scene were of paramount importance. 
  "Russia," said Karadzic, "is returning to the international 
scene not to confront the West, but as a very active factor in 
the process of seeking a solution to the crisis." 
  Asked whether a new concrete initiative can now be expected 
on the part of Russia in connection with the conflict in Bosnia, 
Karadzic said the Russians "will act in coordination with the 
others." He also said at least two of Russia's moves -- the 
settlement of the crisis in Sarajevo and the opening of Tuzla 
airport -- have surprised Western circles. 
  "It seems to me that Russia gained considerable advantage 
points on the basis of which it can now take part in the efforts 
to resolve the crisis on an equal footing. I expect and I 
suppose that meetings will now take place in Moscow similar to 
the ones in Washington," said Karadzic. 
  Commenting on the Washington agreement, Karadzic said it was 
still being analyzed in the Srpska republic and it was not yet 
certain whether the agreement was being drawn up to the 
detriment of Serbs or it was a partial step toward peace. 
  "If they form a joint state, we also have to take care of 
our 
territories and borders. They have to be easy to defend in the 
event our neighbor becomes hostile," Karadzic stressed. 
  "In principle it is not good that America has taken over the 
UN's role and it has replaced international institutions with 
the great ambition to work out an agreement only between the 
Croats and Muslims," Karadzic said. 
  He added: "I am afraid that America is losing yet another 
opportunity to show itself to be impartial. Therefore, the 
impression that it is biased and that it is against Serbs is 
being confirmed." 
  He specified that the next step by the Srpska republic would 
be to strengthen peace on all front lines in order for 
negotiations to take place in the best possible atmosphere, and 
that the Srpska republic would not allow the formation of a 
Croatian-Muslim coalition and their joint state at the Serbs' 
expense. 
  Talking about the decision to open Tuzla airport, Karadzic 
said the Serb side had never opposed the opening of the airport 
for humanitarian purposes, and the deal agreed with the Russians 
ensured that the airport would not be abused.

  [Text] Zagreb, March 4 (AFP) -- Twenty-five Russian experts 
arrived here Friday headed for the Bosnian city of Tuzla, whose 
airport the UN plans to open to relief flights under a 
Russian-brokered accord with the Serb besiegers, the Russian 
embassy said. 
  The experts are to visit the airport, which Bosnian Serb 
leader Radovan Karadzic and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev said Tuesday in Moscow they had agreed to reopen after 
almost two year's closure. Under the agreement, Russian 
observers are to guarantee the airport is not used to bring 
military supplies into the northeastern city. 
  The Russian delegation held talks at UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) headquarters after their arrival in the Croatian 
capital, an UNPROFOR spokesman said. The delegation includes 
officials from the Russian Ministry for Emergencies and is 
headed by Sergey Kudinov [name as received], the spokesman added. 
  UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi said Thursday [3 March] 
however that the Moscow agreement was not enough since it had 
not been approved by the Moslem-led Bosnian Government. Akashi 
said the UN wanted all parties to agree before the airport was 
opened, but that the UN was determined to open it "even without 
an agreement, if necessary."

  [Text] Belgrade, March 3 (TANJUG) -- Col. Momir Zec of the 
Bosnian Serb Army assessed that the decision to allow opening of 
the Tuzla Airfield "was a good move by the military and 
political leadership" of the Bosnian Serb state, the Republic of 
Serbia (R.S.) [in Bosnia-Herzegovina], as "the announced NATO 
threats were being removed" in this way. 
  The Russian forces, which will control the airfield at this 
northeastern Bosnian town under Moslem control, will prevent its 
possible abuse, said Col. Zec to the R.S. news agency SRNA 
Thursday. 
  The accord on opening the airfield at Tuzla was [word 
indistinct] Tuesday during the talks of R.S. President Radovan 
Karadzic with Russian ranking officials in Moscow. 
  The Bosnian Serbs accepted for the Tuzla airfield to be 
opened for humanitarian aid on condition Russian monitors carry 
out control as the Serb side feared the airfield could be used 
for bringing in arms and military equipment to the Bosnian 
Moslems. 
  U.N. Undersecretary for Peace Operations Kofi Annan said 
recently that the U.N. planned the opening of the Tuzla 
airfield for March 7 in an operation which could involve also 
NATO air support, while French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
recently threatned the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes if they 
prevented the opening of the airfield.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 3 (TANJUG) -- Serb military sources 
in eastern Bosnia welcomed the decision of Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic to open Tuzla airport and Russian guarantees 
that its observers would monitor the airport. 
  The commander of the Serb forces in the territories east of 
Tuzla, Colonel Momir Zec, has said that the Serb forces, 
regardless of the agreement which allows humanitarian flights to 
Tuzla, are keeping a close watch on the airport. 
  Col. Zec Told Belgrade daily POLITIKA that the top Serb 
military officials were not surprized by the decision to re-open 
the Tuzla airport. 
  "This is a political move which removes the NATO threats 
and, 
within such a compromise, it suits us better to have Russian 
troops supervize the airport," Col. Zec explained. 
  The whole issue of the Tuzla airport has been discussed by 
the media for the past seven months, the Colonel recalls. It is 
an artificial, extremely politicized construction, allegedly 
aimed at facilitating the supply of relief aid. it is obvious 
that some Western countries want to neutralize the arms embargo 
resolution on Bosnia and use the airport to supply the Bosnian 
Moslems with arms. 
  The Tuzla airport is 5-6 km away from Serb front lines, Col. 
Zec said. it is in poor condition. The runway, which was 
damaged, is being repaired, but not the airport buildings. 
  Colonel Zec also denied some agency allegations that the 
Bosnian Serbs bombarded Tuzla 3 days ago, immediately after the 
downing of the four aircraft near Banjaluka. "We do not bombard 
Tuzla. We only respond to Moslem provocations, but our actions 
are aimed strictly at military targets," Colonel Zec said. 
  Since the beginning of the war, two years ago, there have 
never been large-scale battles between the Serbs and Moslems in 
and around Tuzla. 14,000 Serbs still remain in the town, but 
the Moslem authorities refuse to allow them to leave.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mirko Sagolj: "Russians Did Not Come by </F>
Chance"] 
  [Text] The decision of Milosevic's and Karadzic's (general 
staff) to withdraw their heavy artillery placed around Sarajevo 
before the ultimatum expires, and the way in which Russia is 
(again) getting involved in solving the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
conflict, is a shock to many. What is especially confusing is 
the Russian initiative that actually boils down to protecting 
the Serbs in the Balkans, thus securing an indispensable role 
for Moscow in solving Balkan conflicts. It seems that fate 
would have it that the Russians on one side, and the United 
States and Great Britain on the other meet exactly 49 years 
after the Yalta Conference, where former Yugoslavia was divided 
into two interest spheres precisely on the slopes of Trebevic 
above Sarajevo. Yalta was betrayed only in that the demarcation 
line was moved from the Drina River to the Miljacka River, 
hoping that this is only temporary. 
  The appearance and role of Russian soldiers around Sarajevo 
could confuse and shock only those who are not well acquainted 
with Russia and its inner regularities and do not know what is 
now happening in this country. Every realistic and proper 
analysis would, however, show that events around Sarajevo, as 
the key military and political point of Serbian aggression 
against Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the presence of Russia in these 
parts are evolving according to all rules of logic. 
  The Russian initiative could have come as a surprise, first 
of all, to those who think that the Russian factor became 
extremely weak and negligible in December, 1991, when Boris 
Yeltsin disbanded the omnipotent Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union with two presidential decrees, eliminated communists from 
power, and then disbanded the great "socialist empire" -- the 
Soviet Union. The former Soviet Federation had 15 federal 
republics, spread over 22.4 million square kilometers, had 290 
million inhabitants, a mighty army, and ruled over a good part 
of Europe. 
  According to all formal indicators, it was a superpower that 
both the United States and China feared. However, it is 
fortunate for such a superpower that its strength in the past 50 
years was tested in peace, and it was lucky not to have engaged 
in military conflicts against the West. If it had been put on 
the battlefield against the West, it would have become obvious 
that it was a colossus with feet of clay; with a great 
potential, it is true, but with an enormous question mark as to 
its use. 
  This evaluation is first of all based on the character of 
former authorities in the Soviet Union, which most of the 
inhabitants were not satisfied with, as well as on the very 
structure of the Soviet Federation. The fact that, after the 
collapse of the Soviet Union, not a single former federal 
republic wanted to stay in the same country with Russia, best 
portrays the strength of the entire Soviet Federation. And that 
could be explained: None of the former Soviet federal republics 
joined the federation in a democratic manner, of its own will. 
They all became its members mostly in times of war and under 
presence from Russian tanks. If such a Soviet Union had fought 
a war with a more serious opponent, most of its republics would 
have turned their backs on Russia. How accessible was the 
tissue of the former Soviet military, regardless of all the 
stomic might, a German sports pilot Mathias Rust showed in the 
most convincing manner when, on 28 May, 1987, he landed at 
Moscow's Red Square without any problems whatsoever. During 
World War II, the Germans made daily advances of up to 45 
kilometers on Soviet territory. Perhaps they would advance even 
faster in 1991. 
  Regardless of the fact that Russia left the Soviet Union 
waving the white flag -- almost ravaged materially, 
ideologically, politically, and morally speaking -- it is still 
more powerful than the former Soviet Union, and definitely more 
dangerous. It is indeed a very complex and heterogeneous state 
structure, according to the national composition of its 
inhabitants, but it is far more homogenous and "coordinated" 
than the former Soviet Union, and that is its true strength. It 
is more dangerous because empty spaces on its political scene, 
vacated when the communist were overthrown, are now mostly 
filled by social national demagogues, who promise people they 
will return both Vodka and the glory and homogenize them around 
that idea. Such a Russia not only does not want to give up any 
strategic point of its interests and influence, but wants to 
strengthen them. And Trebevic and the "orthodox brothers in the 
Balkans" are primary Russian interests, and their presence in 
these parts and their role should be viewed in this light. 
  In former Russian views regarding the conflict in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina and ways to solve it, there were significant 
differences. There are no more such differences: The Russian 
parliament, with all its factions, without exceptions, the 
Russian public, President Yeltsin, its government, they all 
point out that there is no solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
without Russia and that they are against using force against 
Serb positions. 
  The world is, therefore, facing Russia again; last time it 
was faced with communism as an ideology and now with 
Zhirinovskiy.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, March 4 (AFP) -- Bosnian Croats and 
Moslems have given the green light for UN troops to patrol 
frontlines between the two groups as talks were to open in 
Vienna Friday [4 March] aimed at working out details of their 
proposed federation. 
  UN patrols due to start as early as Saturday will be 
accompanied by unarmed Croats and Moslems, said Major Rob 
Annink, a spokesman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR). 
Starting Saturday talks will also be held on opening up six 
routes to cross the frontlines. 
  The report comes a day after Bosnian army General Muslimovic 
and his counterpart, General Vrbanac of the Bosnian Croat HVO 
[Croatian Defense Council] force, agreed on the terms of the 
patrols. 
  UN peacekeepers will be deployed immediately at the 
Croat-Moslem hotspots of Mostar, Vitez, Gorni Vakuf, Prozor, 
Konjic, and Jablanica where ceasefire violations have been 
rampant, said UNPROFOR spokesman Major Guy Vinet. Under the 
Moslem-Croat agreement all checkpoints manned by HVO and Bosnian 
army troops will come under UN control, Vinet added. [passage 
omitted] 
  Meanwhile in Vienna, representatives of the Moslem-led 
Bosnian government and Croats were due to open talks at the U.S. 
embassy at 3:30 p.m. (1630 GMT) Friday on the fineprint of how 
to establish a federation. 
  Bosnian Justice Minister Kasem Trnka will head the 
government 
delegation while the Croat delegation will be headed by Deputy 
Croatian Foreign Minister Sanader Ivo. U.S. special envoy on 
ex-Yugoslavia Charles Redman will also attend. 
  A high-level transitional committee has been charged with 
drafting a constitution for the Croat-Moslem federation as well 
as the outlines of a confederal arrangement linking the proposed 
alliance with the Republic of Croatia. 
  The committee in addition will try to forge a military 
accord 
between Bosnian Moslems and Croats and an agreement on the shape 
of governmental structures in the proposed federation. The 
talks here are expected to last around 10 days. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Bosniak-Croat agreement represents a victory 
for those Bosniaks who remained faithful to the program paved by 
the Party of Democratic Action [SDA]. This was stated today, 
among other things, at a news conference by the SDA. On behalf 
of the SDA, correspondents were addressed by Edhem Becakcic, a 
member of the SDA Main Committee; Dr. Fahet Halilovic, president 
of the Sarajevo Municipal Committee; and Muhamed Kupusovic, a 
member of the municipal committee. Edin Muhic has more details: 
  [Begin recording] [Muhic] The main topics of today's SDA 
news conference were the Bosniak-Croat agreement and the UN 
administration of the wretched Sarajevo. Edhem Becakcic spoke 
on the SDA's stance on the international community initiatives 
for resolving the Sarajevo issue: 
  [Becakcic] The SDA accepts administrative assistance to the 
legal authorities of Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
restoration and reconstruction of [word indistinct] of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina capital. Demilitarization is a victory of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, which was defending and managed to 
defend all of Sarajevo's residents and which agreed to the 
lifting of the artillery blockade of Sarajevo after it has 
successfully endured attacks of enormous artillery [words 
indistinct] aggressor. 
  [Muhic] The Bosniak-Croat agreement is a better solution 
than all previous draft agreements on Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
internal organization, president of the SDA municipal committee 
Fahet Halilovic stated. At the beginning, he emphasized the 
positive segments of this agreement: 
  [Halilovic] These are: coalition, the right to veto, 
proportional representation, and the autonomy of cantons. This 
is actually a model that [word indistinct] so far the most 
perfect solution for these mixed, complex societies. 
  [Muhic] It is also positive in that the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
crisis is trying to be resolved by political means in this way. 
One of the negative implications of this agreement is that the 
independence of administrative units could be used by some [word 
indistinct] forces as the basis for further ethnic cleansing. 
Asked by a correspondent whether the agreement makes allowances 
for such occurrences, Dr. Halilovic replied that there is a 
possibility that in the ethnically cleansed environments the 
fascist elements would try to [word indistinct] the actual 
situation. This agreement limits the possibilities for such 
occurrences; however, the actual situation unfortunately often 
deviates from a normative agreement. 
  Regarding the problem of a UN administration of Sarajevo, 
Dr. 
Halilovic says: 
  [Halilovic] What must be emphasized is that the duration of 
the UN administration is strictly limited, as we must insist on 
this -- namely two years. What the administrator must do is 
secure the integrity of the town of nine communes, with the 
exception of Pale, which was treated differently even in the 
Vance-Owen plan. No solution can be vested in this way if a 
plebiscite of the residents is not carried out throughout the 
entire territory of Sarajevo, in all communes. 
  [Muhic] The plan that envisaged a union of republics of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina from last August has been surpassed, Muhamed 
Kupusovic, a member of the municipal committee and president of 
the Sarajevo Executive Council, emphasized: 
  [Kukusovic] I would like to emphasize one point, and that is 
that certain factors of this plan have nevertheless remained -- 
namely, in the coming talks and combinations to resolve the 
problem of Sarajevo, Pale has been excluded as the town's 
commune. 
  [Muhic] Edhem Becakcic was asked whether the Bosniak-Croat 
agreement represents the partitioning of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
two parts. He replied that such a partitioning is out of the 
question, and that time will show how the problem of the 
territories controlled by Karadzic's Serbs will be resolved.

<F P=106> [Article by Sinisa Ljepojevic] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, March 3 (TANJUG) -- Initial analysis and 
reactions to the just-signed agreement on the creation of a 
Croat-Moslem federation in the ex-Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, underscore the idea's serious drawbacks and 
the almost certain impossibility of its realization since the 
agreement does not take reality into consideration and 
eliminates from the game the Serbs, the key factor in Bosnia. 
  What is the reality in which the Croat-Moslem federation 
should exist. 
  In the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
local Croats and Moslems have over the past year been waging a 
war whose brutality exceeds all previous conflicts in this 
region. This is why it is difficult to believe that such 
opponents will so easily and simply agree to forget everything 
and start anew. 
  In its first reactions on Thursday morning, Moslem Sarajevo 
radio cited its Mostar correspondent who said that, after 
everything, life alongside the Croats in this city will not be 
possible. 
  Both the Bosnian Croats and Moslems have already carried out 
ethnic cleansing in territories they control, while the property 
of those who managed to survive and flee to other parts of ex- 
Yugoslavia, has almost completely been destroyed. The 
agreement, however, calls for all to return home. 
  Under the agreement, a single Croat-Moslem army will be 
created from the existing officer ranks, while all foreign 
armies, including the U.N. troops, will withdraw from the 
territory of the Croat- Moslem federation. 
  All further comments about this are unnecessary. 
  The agreement also fails to say which territories are in 
question and it is assumed that the Serb side will give up to 
the Moslems what was promised. 
  However, promises were made within the European Union's plan 
for the division of Bosnia into three ethnic states, so that 
this assumption, as well as the entire agreement, were made 
without consulting the Serbs. 
  Washington's concept is to create a dual state and thus 
enable the Moslems to preserve, even partially, the unity of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina, to extend their territories, to secure 
access to the Adriatic Sea and set up a strong negotiating (even 
possibly military) block against the Serbs in the forthcoming 
talks. 
  Since the sponsor of the agreement, the United States, 
interprets it as a path towards a peace solution, one wonders 
what stand will the Serb side take. 
  Initial Bosnian Serb reactions are that the agreement is 
acceptable in general, but only if it is not aimed against them. 
  It remains to be seen whether the Serbs will agree, as is 
hardly likely, to enable the creation of the Moslem-Croat 
federation in whose forming they did not take part. 
  The only logic in all this would be that the West is 
interested in linking up with the Moslem territories in Bosnia, 
via Croatia and its sponsors, and thus isolating it from 
possible fundametalist influences of the Islamic countries. 
  This then gives rise to the question who is the real friend 
of the Bosnian Moslems, who are of Slav origin. 
  The Washington agreement has primarily defeated the Moslem 
idea on the unity of Bosnia by linking them, via the Croats, to 
the influential Catholic church and opening up the road towards 
the loss of the Moslem ethnic and cultural identity. 
  It is now being revealed that only the Bosnian Serbs wanted 
a 
Moslem state and were only ones who were not opposed to it. 
  Basically, all agreements are good if they aim for peace, 
but 
the Washington one has slim chances since it eliminates the key 
factor -- Serbs.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 3 (TANJUG) -- Commander of the 
Bosnian Serb Army General Ratko Mladic on Thursday promised 
maximum help to Commander of the United Nations Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslavia Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina General Michael Rose, whom he described as a 
"man of profession who is doing his best to restore peace in the 
area of Sarajevo and in other parts." 
  After talks with General Rose in Sarajevo's Serb suburb of 
Lukavica, General Mladic stressed the fact that the Bosnian 
Serbs had placed their most important [word indistinct] in the 
Sarajevo area under U.N. control and expressed satisfaction 
that the UNPROFOR commander was "aware that the Moslems have 
again breached agreement and declined to withdraw any part of 
their infantry." 
  "I think it is good that General Rose insists on a balance 
of 
power and urges that the Moslem side should make reciprocal 
moves," he added. 
  "I hope UNPROFOR will influence the Moslems to realize that 
they cannot expect the peacekeepers or NATO to wage war for them 
and that they should come to the negotiating table and settled 
disputes by political means. Before that, I don't believe 
anybody could guarantee the realization of their crazy idea 
about a multi-ethnic, multi-confessional or Islamic country on 
Serb territory," Mladic said. 
  The agreement reached by the Croats and Moslems to form a 
federation in Bosnia is welcome if it is striving towards peace 
but it would not be good if this is not the case, said General 
Mladic. 
  "We are ready for both," he said and added that the 
avoidance 
of the Moslem military commanders to meet with the Serb side 
indicated that they were still hoping to get somebody on their 
side to fight for their goals. 
  Top military officers of the Bosnian Serb and Moslem armies 
were expected to meet at Sarajevo airport on Thursday to discuss 
ceasefire and free movement of civilians in the Sarajevo area 
but Moslem Commander Rasim Delic did not arrive to the meeting. 
  After talks with Mladic, General Rose voiced optimism in 
view 
of the restoration of peace in Sarajevo. 
  Rose said the bridge linking the Serb suburb of Grbavica and 
the Moslem part of Sarajevo was now open only for UNPROFOR 
troops and vehicles. 
  Talks on free passage of vehicles of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are also under way, he added.

  [Text] Bosnian Serb authorities are refusing to allow a 
convoy of the Dutch United Nations battalion to get through to 
the besieged Muslim enclave of Srebrenica. The Serbs are 
protesting about the amount of military equipment, especially 
ammunition, that the Dutch troops are taking to Srebrenica. The 
Serbs are also preventing 180 Canadian troops from leaving the 
Muslim enclave. 
  The Dutch contingent is authorized to relieve the Canadian 
blue helmets under an agreement signed by several parties 
including the Bosnian Serbs. At first the takeover operation 
encountered no resistance, but in the past few days the Serbs 
have toughened their stance.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 4 March carries in its 
regular 8-minute newscast the following reports on the fighting 
in the republic. 
  Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Sermic reports that "the 
fighting on the Maglaj front has been escalating minute by 
minute since the early morning hours. The chetniks are 
relentlessly carrying on with their attacks on the free 
territory and its defenders. At the moment, all types of 
artillery and antiaircraft weapon shells are pounding the 
positions of the 201st Chivalrous Brigade and other 
[Bosnia-Herzegovina Army] units and are an introduction to 
infantry attacks on the (?Hedrovace)-Siprage-(?Tresjiste) line 
and the region of Nekolj. Civilian targets in the town and 
surrounding villages are also not spared. Dozens of howitzer 
and mortar shells have already hit and destroyed residential and 
business buildings. This is the tenth day that the population 
has been in shelters." 
  Hamid Deronjic reports from Brcko and says that "the 
shelling 
of the free Brcko territory defense lines continued overnight. 
Vranovaca, Djukici, and Kladje were targeted by 80-mm and 82-mm 
enemy mortars. From the direction of Brod, the chetniks opened 
fierce Praga and machine gun fire at the defenders' positions on 
the central sector of the front. Overnight, all the free Brcko 
territory defense positions came under intensified fire from 
enemy infantry weapons. The air corridor over the temporarily 
occupied Brcko continues to be used in the continuing aggression 
on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Between 1800 [1700 GMT] and 1900 last 
night, three overflights of enemy transport helicopters were 
registered on the Brcko-Kicevo route; at 2045, another chetnik 
helicopter was sighted flying the same route." 
  Reporting from the Bosna Operative Group Press Center in 
Zavidovici, correspondent Viktor Boban says that "it seems that 
the Washington agreement is taking hold in the Bosna Operative 
Group operational zone, because the confrontation lines with the 
Croatian Defense Council [HVO] have been mostly calm, which is 
not the case with the lines facing the Serbian aggressor. The 
defenders at Mahoje were the target of small arms and 
antiaircraft machine guns, and some time after 1200, 10 82-mm 
mortar shells fell in the wider area of Hajdarevici. The night 
was calm, with only sporadic small arms fire. The exception was 
the area of Hajdarevici, where several 82-mm mortar shells 
landed before midnight. Minor chetnik regrouping and movements 
of heavy armored combat vehicles from Mt. Ozren have been 
sighted. It is quiet this morning on all the stable defense 
lines in the Bosna Operative Group operational zone." 
  Enes Rastusic reports from the 4th Corps Information Center 
on the situation on the Mostar front. He says that the "past 24 
hours in the 4th Corps operational zone were marked by sporadic 
small arms and antiaircraft provocations along all defense 
lines. The cease-fire was particularly violated in the southern 
parts of the Mostar Commune, the free Prozor territories, and in 
Konjic. Our defenders are consistently observing the cease-fire 
and did not respond to enemy provocations. Personnel of the 4th 
Corps thwarted an attempt to infiltrate a [word indistinct] 
reconnaissance and subversion group in the region of 
(?Bijelimic). The demarcation lines remain unchanged and under 
the control of Bosnia-Herzegovina Army units."

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1000 GMT on 4 March carries in its 
regular 4-minute newscast two reports updating the fighting in 
the republic. 
  Mirudin Aldobasic reports from the 7-South Operative Group 
Information Center saying that "overnight and in the early 
morning hours the aggressor continued his bestial destruction of 
residential areas in the Maglaj and Tesanj regions, and the free 
territories of Doboj and Teslic. In addition to this, he is 
relentlessly attacking the 133 km long defense lines in this 
area. The chetniks also attacked Tesanj and its outskirts. 
They attempted infantry breakthroughs in the area of Cerik and 
Jelicev Gaj, situated in the wider region of Miljanovci, but 
their attempts were thwarted. Over 100 enemy troops were put 
out of action in last night's battles on the Teslic-Tesanj 
defense line, 30 of whom were killed. In addition to this, they 
[Serbs] shelled civilian targets in the Tesanj region, 
particularly Mrkotic, Planje, and Radrsa. These attacks and the 
chetnik devastation are still in progress." He adds that "there 
was also fierce fighting in the Doboj region. One of the 
enemy's terrorist-subversion groups infiltrated the area of 
Mravici, Karusaj, and Matuzici, but it was quickly discovered 
and destroyed. This morning, the brave members of the 203d 
Motorized Brigade Doboj-Bosna repelled fierce enemy infantry 
attacks in this area." 
  Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports that "the 
bestial 
shelling of the Bihac and Cazin areas continued overnight. 
Chetnik howitzers, tanks, Bofors, Zis, mortars [words 
indistinct] where everything is being systematically destroyed. 
Fierce shelling and combined artillery and infantry attacks 
directed at the defenders on Grabez and the Grmusko-Srbljanski 
plateau continued late last night and this morning. Artillery 
provocations continued on the demarcation lines with the army of 
the so-called Kladusa autonomy, particularly in the region of 
(?Trst) in the Cazin Commune. The situation in the Velika 
Kladusa Commune is best illustrated by Fikret Abdic himself, who 
two days ago ordered new measures against all those who are not 
on his side. This is in effect an introduction to a fresh 
offensive on the free part of Bihac Commune."

city of Banja Luka in northern Bosnia, a UN spokesman said here 
Friday. 
  UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Kris 
Janowski told reporters of several cases of rape and murder 
since January. He said that despite reports that some of the 
attacks were carried out by "uniformed" men, none of the cases 
had ever been followed up by the authorities. 
  "Everybody's wearing pretty much the same kind of uniform. 
We understand that they are either part of some sort of militia 
or Serb military or whoever," he said of the perpetrators. 
  He said the authorities told the UNHCR "all the time" that 
they had nothing to do with the attacks which were allegedly 
being done by criminals. "But none of these cases has ever been 
followed and no one has ever been punished so we assume that 
this is all done with the knowledge and at least the silent 
consent of the authorities. Otherwise they would do something 
to stop it." 
  Janowski said "at least five persons have been murdered 
since 
the beginning of January in Banja Luka" but he did not give 
details. 
  He added that there were "countless cases of people being 
beaten up and intimidated, the Moslem neighborhood raided by 
uniformed gangs... trying to give them the message to get out" 
and that this had "been going on for quite a while." He cited 
the case of 200 Moslems who had fled the village of Bronzani 
Majdan, not far from Banja Luka, and asked the UNHCR to get them 
out of the country. [passage omitted] 
  "We are trying to monitor the situation but it is very 
difficult," Janowski said.

  [Text] Over the past 24 hours Muslim forces continued 
attacking Serb positions and villages, the most intensive 
attacks being launched in the northern part of the Srpska 
republic. 
  Last night Muslim forces based in a number of Bihac suburbs 
launched artillery attacks on Serb positions killing one Serb 
soldier and wounding four others in Barakovac [a village near 
Bihac], a SRNA [Serb news agency] correspondent has reported, 
quoting a communique issued by the command of the 2d Krajina 
Corps of the Srpska republic army. 
  Members of the 5th Corps of the Muslim Army loyal to Alija 
Izetbegovic based in Zalozje, Carkici, Cekrlije, and Vinica have 
continuously been attacking Serb fighters' positions. Muslim 
units have been launching the fiercest attacks against Serb 
positions in Barakovac above Bihac. Fighters of the 2d Krajina 
Corps have successfully repelled all attacks. 
  Due to their failures on the battlefield, the Muslim 
authorities of Bihac district tried to stage-manage another 
Markale [Sarajevo market place massacre in February] in Bihac 
for consumption by the foreign media. Muslim information media 
in Bihac said last night that a Serb artillery round killed 12 
civilians. This news was denied today by the command of the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] French battalion stationed in 
Caralici near Cazin, saying that the Serbs did not carry out any 
attacks at all yesterday. 
  In addition, Muslim authorities in Bihac yesterday banned 
all 
humanitarian convoys bound for the western part of the Srpska 
republic from passing through the Cazin area. As a result, 
humanitarian aid will in the future travel through the territory 
of the republic of Serb Krajina [in Croatia], a journey that is 
several hundred kilometers longer.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1100 GMT on 4 March carries in its 
regular 17-minute newscast two reports on the fighting in the 
republic. 
  An unidentified correspondent reports from the 3d Corps 
Press 
Center and says that "over the past few days, the ustasha 
provocations have not been intense enough to provoke our army's 
troops, which have been consistently observing the orders of the 
military command. Yesterday was marked by mainly small arms 
provocations by the enemy side. Sniper fire at our defense 
lines in the regions of Nevic Polje and Ciglane on the Vitez 
front, and at our positions around Busovaca from the direction 
of Pabjak, Kula, Radenovac, Komar, and Donje Polje constituted 
the most frequent provocations. In Gornji Vakuf, the ustashas 
fired several Tromblon grenades in addition to small arms 
provocations, but our soldiers did not respond." 
  He adds that "the chetniks from their artillery strongholds 
continue to shell civilian buildings sporadically. They fired 
several mortar shells at Zavidovici, and they fired a dozen 
artillery shells of various types at villages close to the 
defense lines. The chetniks also fired several shells at 
Bugojno from the direction of Donji Vakuf, which resulted in 
sizable material damage." 
  An unidentified correspondent from Gracanica reports that 
"in 
a counterattack carried out on this front, our defenders 
liberated two dominant peaks where the chetniks had killed 
dozens of innocent civilians in the course of the war. 
Overnight, the aggressor from the direction of Bosansko Suho 
Polje used 82-mm and 120-mm mortars to shell civilian targets in 
Klokotnica [words indistinct] at Stefan Polje. During the 
night, the chetniks brought in fresh forces and equipment to the 
Trebava [River] front. Over 60 truckloads of men arrived in the 
areas of Paleznica and (?Sember) Rijeka, while five tanks have 
been deployed facing our defense lines. This implies that the 
chetniks will today launch an even fiercer offensive in these 
areas."

  [Text] Lieutenant General Ratko Mladic, commander of the 
army of the Sr pska republic, held talks in Lukavica today with 
General Michael Rose, commander of UNPROFOR [United Nations 
Protection Forces] for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, about 
strengthening the peace in Sarajevo. The two commanders also 
talked about further controlling the weapons in and around 
Sarajevo, particularly the Muslim weapons, as the Muslim side 
has still not fully complied with the agreement on putting its 
weapons under UNPROFOR's control. By the way, as Rasim Delic, 
commander of the so-called Muslim army, did not show up, the 
meeting of military commanders of the Serbian and Muslim armies 
that should have been held in Sarajevo today did not take place. 
Michael Rose tried to excuse Delic's failure to come to the 
meeting with his being busy establishing peace, as he put it, 
for his people in central Bosnia.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, March 4 (AFP) -- UN officials remain 
confident they are on track to restore peace to Sarajevo despite 
isolated violations of a truce in the capital. But their 
optimism was dented Friday when UN Bosnia commander General 
Michael Rose expressed unhappiness about the failure of rival 
military commanders to attend a joint meeting the previous day. 
  "There is no way back," Viktor Andreyev, civilian affairs 
officer for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) told AFP Thursday. 
  UNPROFOR officers have said a ceasefire that began February 
11 is holding despite violations that have included mortar fire 
within the 20-kilometre (12-mile) heavy weapons exclusion zone 
NATO has declared around Sarajevo. Small-arms and grenade 
attacks have increased along the confrontation line in the 
capital. 
  "We're going in the right direction but we have to move fast 
when these incidents occur to keep it from getting worse," 
UNPROFOR spokesman Canadian Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Sarajevo was calm overnight Thursday but this week has 
marked 
the most serious shooting in the Bosnian capital since the 
ceasefire began. The shooting is coming mainly from the Jewish 
cemetery in southern Sarajevo, where French troops are 
monitoring the ceasefire on the Bosnian side and Russian troops 
are on the Serb side. [passage omitted] 
  Andreyev said the fact that shelling of Sarajevo had stopped 
was the mark of success so far. "One cannot expect things to go 
straight and without bumps," he said of prospects for securing a 
lasting peace and restoring utilities and other services to the 
besieged city. 
  Andreyev said the process "must succeed. We must succeed."

  [Text] [Begin recording] [Leko] The Republic of Hungary 
is among the 46 countries with which Bosnia-Herzegovina has 
established diplomatic relations and one of the first countries 
to have done so. Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary 
Gabor (Bagy), upon presenting the credentials of President Arpad 
Goncz, emphasized that Hungary is also looking after a sizable 
number of refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  President Izetbegovic, upon receiving the credentials, said 
that this action confirms Bosnia-Herzegovina's international and 
legal legitimacy and at the same time represents support in the 
struggle against the aggression, for freedom and democracy. 
Then President Izetbegovic added: 
  [Izetbegovic] Our people know of the support that [words 
indistinct] offers in the struggle for the defense of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and they know the fact that a great number of 
our refugees are there [words indistinct]. The manner in which 
[word indistinct] the president of your state supports the 
anti-fascist struggle of the Bosnia-Herzegovina people [words 
indistinct] is priceless for the strengthening of democracy in 
Europe and in the entire world. 
  [Leko] After this and after presenting his credentials, 
Hungarian Ambassador Gabor (Bagy), in a statement for 
journalists, said: 
  [Bagy] This is an expression of Hungry's stance regarding 
the resolution of the crisis on this territory. This is a 
stance that rejects forceful changes of borders, ethnic 
cleansing, and change of ethnic [word indistinct] and does not 
recognize the consequences of this. Hungary hails the new 
element in the resolution of the crisis and the greater activity 
of the international community, the United States, and other 
international factors, as well as active participation in the 
resolution of the crisis in this area, and supports these 
initiatives. 
  In bilateral relations we have many possibilities for trade, 
however, [word indistinct] present war-restricted circumstances, 
but Hungary has a lasting interest in developing relations with 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, not merely in bilateral relations, but also 
in relations of the multilateral integration of the central 
European territories, were Hungary ascribes an important role to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Franjo Tudjman on the </F>
Washington agreement between Croats and Muslims in Zagreb on 3 
March -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] To Croatian people at 
home and abroad, to all citizens of Croatia: The day before 
yesterday, 1 March, a preliminary agreement was signed in 
Washington between representatives of the Croat and the Bosnian 
Muslim people regarding the organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
along federal lines -- as a community of inherently sovereign 
people in the Federal Republic of Bosnia- Herzegovina and on its 
entering a coalition with Croatia. Given its content and the 
circumstances in which it was created, this agreement is of 
far-reaching and also crucial and historical importance. The 
agreement was reached under the aegis of the United States and 
with the consent of leading European countries. For this 
reason, this agreement first of all means a radical change in 
their attitude to the settlement of the crisis on former 
Yugoslav soil. 
  The most important international factors -- led by the 
United 
States -- have finally come to the conclusion that one has to 
take resolute steps in order to end the three-year crisis, which 
began with the aggression of the Yugo-communist army and Serbia 
against Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and end the 
war in Bosnia which has caused one of the biggest tragedies of 
our time and is threatening to spread the catastrophe of war 
worldwide. 
  These were and still are the reasons for which the state 
policy of democratic Croatia will stand by its orientation 
toward achieving and protecting vital national interests in 
accordance with international circumstances. 
  By adhering to principles and through our consistent policy 
in this respect, Croatia gradually gained favor with those who 
were not partial to its sovereignty and independent policy and 
finally obtained full guarantees from the most responsible 
international factors for the security of its state and the 
future of the Croatian people. 
  Croatia increasingly won the trust of the world democratic 
public and responsible statesmen starting with a recommendation 
that the Croatian people should take part in a referendum for 
the retention of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the urgent establishment of 
diplomatic relations with the government in Sarajevo, and the 
urging and accepting of proposals for the settlement of the 
crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina along cantonal, provincial and 
finally confederal lines in the form of a union of republics. 
This was rejected both by the Serb and the Muslim sides until 
the agreement was signed in Washington. 
  The implementation of the agreement signed in Washington by 
Croatian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mate Granic, 
Prime Minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina Haris Silajdzic, and 
Kresimir Zubak, president of the presidential council of the 
Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna, is in the interest of the 
Croatian and Bosnian Muslim nations, as well as the 
international community. 
  An end to the war between the Muslim and Croat nations in 
Bosnia is of paramount importance for us. That conflict has 
caused great loss in human life and material destruction to the 
Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and brings the threat of 
international sanctions upon Croatia because of the assistance 
lent to them [Bosnian Croats], first in the defense against the 
Serb aggression, and then in their struggle against the threat 
of the Muslim extremist forces. 
  The agreement between the Croatian and Muslim sides also 
sets 
conditions for reaching an agreement with the Serb side and for 
defining borders acceptable to all three nations within Bosnia- 
Herzegovina. However, international factors must persist in 
seeking a sensible overall solution in order to create 
preconditions for normal neighborly relations between the new 
Croatian-Bosnian confederal union on the one side and Serbia, 
that is, Yugoslavia on the other side; all the more so because 
this [agreement] determines a new long-term fault-line between 
international powers which have for centuries been opposing and 
fighting each other in this critical region of different 
civilizations. 
  All national and political entities which are in any way 
participating in solving the extremely complex Bosnian problem 
should -- in the interests of European and global peace -- do 
everything they can in order to reach an accord between the 
three warring nations and their mother-countries, but also with 
the main world factors -- the United Nations, the European 
Union, the United States, and the Russian Federation, in order 
to create preconditions for the stability of a new international 
order in this part of Europe, precisely because its birth has 
caused unimaginable war atrocities and threats of conflict 
between civilizations. 
  The implementation of the Washington agreement will secure 
the survival and future of the Croat people not only within the 
borders of the Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna, established in 
the war of defense, but throughout the territory of Bosnia, 
which will not be allocated to the separate Serb Republic. 
Furthermore, the agreement guarantees Croats full national 
sovereignty in the Croat cantons -- probably to be called 
grand-counties [velezupe] in Croatian -- which will form a Croat 
council as a separate representative body of the Croat 
community, as well as full parity and complete equality in 
overall state affairs of the Federal Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  All of this will have additional guarantees in the 
recognition of dual citizenship, i.e., Croatian citizenship 
too, for every member of the Croatian people from Bosnia as well 
as in the confederal union between Croatia and the Federal 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This confederal union will be 
based on shared interests in developing comprehensive relations 
in all spheres, particularly in international and defense 
policies, the economy, science, and culture. 
  The establishment of a joint command of defense forces is 
envisaged, as well as a customs and monetary union within the 
framework of a common market. A permanent confederal council 
[konfederalno vijece] will be formed with a view to coordinating 
joint policy and activity. 
  The materialization of the envisaged federation between the 
Croatian and the Bosnian Muslim people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
its confederation with Croatia implies creating needed 
political, constitutional, and legal foundations. 
  The Croats ought to understand that such a solution is 
historically necessary and purposeful for the survival of 
Croatiandom in Bosnia and the protection of the Croatian state's 
strategic interests. The alliance with the Croats secures the 
survival of the Bosnian Muslims in these lands, as well as links 
with western civilization and democratic countries. 
  The effective implementation of the agreement on both unions 
[federation and confederation], something that is in the vital 
interest of both peoples as well as of the democratic Western 
world, can only be opposed by advocates of narrow-minded 
nationalism and extremist-fundamentalist views. 
  Unlike such exceptions, the vast majority of Croats and 
Bosnians -- not just those Muslims who have hitherto declared 
themselves as Croats -- will wholeheartedly start building the 
shared future. 
  Referring to all the above, I find it necessary to emphasize 
that the Croatian-Bosnian-Muslim union is not aimed against the 
Serbs. Nor is it being created in order to continue the war. It 
is being created to secure peace without delay. 
  Croatia will remain committed to peaceful, political 
solutions to all contested issues, including the normalization 
of Serbian- Croatian relations on the basis of mutual 
recognition, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. In order 
to achieve this, Serbia and Yugoslavia ought to stop supporting 
the further occupation of Croatian territories by arming 
[Krajina], introducing a shared currency, and suchlike. 
  It is high time for Krajina's Serbs to draw their 
conclusions 
about the futility of continuing their resistance to being 
integrated into Croatia's constitutional and legal order, 
because their further out-maneuverings of UN Security Council 
resolutions will no longer be tolerated either from the point of 
view of Croatian interests or from the point of view of 
international interests. 
  Croatia guarantees to them all human, civil and ethnic 
rights, but it cannot tolerate any delay in the return of its 
refugees, the reintegration of its state territory, and the 
establishment of normal conditions for its further economic and 
cultural development. 
  Dear Croats at home and abroad, the citizens of Croatia, by 
signing the agreement in Washington, we took a big step along 
the difficult path to secure the future of the Croatian nation, 
and the stability and prosperity of the Croatian state. On our 
part, we will do everything to complete the agreement as soon as 
possible in the constitutional and legal sense, and to implement 
it. 
  During the talks which our foreign minister and I personally 
held with representatives of many foreign countries -- and on 
the day the agreement was signed even with U.S. President 
Clinton -- we received assurances from the most senior statesmen 
and world factors that Croatia would be given support in solving 
all its vital and burning problems. Everyone promised us 
diverse and resolute assistance in the process of integrating 
the areas under the protection of the peace forces into the 
overall life in Croatia. We were promised assistance for 
reconstruction. World and all international financial 
institutions will be free to offer us loans and to finance 
various economic investment programs, which have so far been 
denied to us. The door to European integration will be opened 
to us, as well as admission into NATO's Partnership for Peace 
protection system. 
  All this confirms that major international factors today 
consider Croatia an important, even one of the crucial, elements 
for establishing peace and international order in this part of 
Europe. All this leads us to believe that we have come close to 
the ending of the war and the beginning of a new period in the 
building of the sovereign democratic state of Croatia. 
  The new conditions will allow us to dedicate all our 
potential to the economic recovery and cultural development of 
our homeland. The preliminary Washington agreement has 
therefore created preconditions for a political solution to the 
crisis, for an end to the destruction of war, killing and 
persecution of people, and for their return to normal life. 
Briefly, it heralds peace. 
  All this confirms the correctness and usefulness of our 
consistent state policy, the paramount goal of which has always 
been to secure the freedom of the Croatian people and the 
sovereignty of Croatia with as few victims as possible. We have 
strengthened the democratic system and international standing of 
the Croatian state guided by our own judgment, maturity and 
support of the vast majority of the Croatian people and all 
citizens of Croatia. We can be proud of the results we have 
achieved and new possibilities which have opened up for us, but 
we should also be aware of the responsibilities and the 
seriousness of the tasks ahead of us in new, more favorable 
international conditions.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic </F>
by Dubravko Merlic; from the "Slikom na Sliku" program -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Merlic] Good evening, esteemed viewers, and 
welcome to this evening's Slikom na Sliku program. As we 
announced earlier, our guest this evening is Mate Granic, vice 
prime minister and minister of foreign affairs. Good evening, 
and welcome back from your successful diplomatic tour. 
  [Granic] Good evening. 
  [Merlic] [passage omitted] Mr. Granic, I am under the 
impression that the vast majority of reactions to the 
preliminary agreement signed in Washington are extremely 
favorable, except for a few unfavorable or restrained reactions 
from Serbia. What is the true situation on the ground, and do 
you have any information from Herceg-Bosna? I hear that 
politicians and people in Herceg-Bosna are finding it difficult 
to accept this agreement. It seems that the wounds sustained in 
this serious Muslim-Croat conflict have not yet healed. 
  [Granic] There are fears, and one should be understanding 
and 
make explanations patiently. I think this is our reality. I 
believe that people will accept the agreement, but we must be 
patient in explaining all the advantages the Croatian people 
will gain by this agreement in both Herceg-Bosna and in Croatia. 
  [Merlic] What was particularly well stressed in President 
Tudjman's speech, I think, was that this proposal--this 
agreement-- would not be accepted only by narrow-minded 
nationalists and Islamic fundamentalists. How realistic is 
this, given the situation on the ground? 
  [Granic] The president gave his assessment of the agreement 
today. You said that 60 countries requested permission to 
broadcast his speech immediately. It is quite certain that many 
other countries will make such a request. This has been a 
number one topic in the world and on all TV stations over the 
past three days. I believe there will be a lack of understanding 
initially. I believe there will be fear, but I also believe 
that once it is all over, and when not just a preliminary but 
also a final agreement are signed, the people will accept it. 
  [Merlic] In the past few days politicians from Herceg-Bosna 
expressed their views and sharp criticism, saying that they 
could not accept an agreement which contains no guarantees of 
territories, of the territorial integrity of this Croatian part 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Are these fears justified? 
  [Granic] We have received guarantees at different levels 
with 
this agreement. On the one side, from the geopolitical, 
geostrategic, and economic point of view, Croatia has every 
interest in a confederation based on a modern union: a customs, 
monetary, and economic union and a defense alliance, with a 
shared command, confederal council. On the other--as far as 
Croats in Bosnia- Herzegovina are concerned--all Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be included in this agreement. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Merlic] Talking about the cantons--or as they will be 
called in Croatian, grand counties [velezupa]... 
  [Granic, interrupting] President Tudjman said that today, 
and 
we will probably propose that name.... 
  [Merlic, interrupting] You said that the cantons will be 
sovereign. What duties will lie with the cantons? Will the 
cantons have armies and police? 
  [Granic] You see, it says here that the cantons will have 
jurisdiction over police, education, culture, housing issues.... 
  [Merlic, interrupting] Talking about the police, will they 
have different uniforms in different cantons, or will they be 
the same? 
  [Granic] The uniforms will be the same, but the insignia 
will 
differ from canton to canton. That has been agreed upon. 
Therefore, certain tasks will be carried out at the level of the 
federation, there will be joint tasks, and some tasks will be 
exclusively under the jurisdiction of the cantons. The basic 
aim was to set up a federation that can function on the one 
hand, and on the other hand, to secure a high level of 
decentralization in the form of cantons which are inherently 
sovereign, and which are federal units. 
  [Merlic] The army will be at the level of the federation. 
  [Granic] There is a final solution and a solution for the 
interim period. Nothing will change in the interim period; 
things will only be coordinated. The final solution envisages 
the army to be at the level of the federation. I will read it 
out: joint command, joint military system within the 
confederation and the protection of borders. That will be at 
the level of the federation, at the level of the cantons. 
[sentence as heard] 
  [Merlic] It could be irresponsible to mention this now, but 
a 
prominent leader of the Party of Democratic Action [SDA - 
Stranka demokratske akcije] of Croatia spoke on the TV 
Parliament program last week about the navy in Neum. Is that 
irresponsible, or is he well informed? 
  [Granic] I think that is irresponsible. As I said, we will 
have coordination at the level of the confederation [as heard]. 
Therefore, this has never been mentioned. We do want 
coordination because we have the same strategic interests in 
having a defense alliance and coordination at the level of the 
confederation. But of course such ideas were not discussed. 
  [Merlic] Let us go back to the Croat-Bosniak federation 
briefly. What seems to me the greatest problem that needs to be 
dealt with in the future is the territorial division. It is not 
mentioned anywhere how many and which cantons there will be and 
which territory they will cover. 
  [Granic] There are proposals, but there have been no 
official 
talks on that issue yet. 
  [Merlic] Do we know how many cantons there will be? 
  [Granic] It is certain that Hercegovina will be a separate 
canton, as well as western Bosnia and Posavina. There are 
various possibilities for central Bosnia. 
  [Merlic] Will central Bosnia perhaps be a mixed canton? 
  [Granic] There have been proposals to make central Bosnia 
one 
big mixed canton with two sub-cantons, one of which would be 
Croat and one Bosniak, or perhaps to have two separate cantons. 
No agreement has been reached on that. The exact number of 
cantons will be discussed over the next 10 days. No agreement 
has been reached so far. [passage omitted reiterates Serbs 
should give up 20 percent of their territory through 
negotiations; summary of Russia's involvement in solving the 
Bosnian crisis over the past 10 days] I was invited to go to 
Moscow today, but that was not possible because of my visit to 
Paris. I will go to Moscow next week. 
  [Merlic] There are several options for the Bosnian Serbs. 
They can say no, they can yield territory, or they can join in 
and remain in Bosnia-Herzegovina in one way or another. What 
seems the most likely possibility to you? 
  [Granic] As it has been said, they will be invited to join 
in 
under the same conditions. 
  [Merlic] On the federal principle? 
  [Granic] Yes, that is right. They will be invited to join in 
on the federal principle--after the principles are agreed upon, 
of course. That is the first option. The second option is for 
them to remain in some kind of relationship with the federation, 
as the European Union has suggested--the (?division between) the 
federation and the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. That is one of 
the possibilities. In any case, they would not be allowed to 
leave now. [passage omitted] 
  [Merlic] If the Bosnian Serbs decide to remain in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina, either on this federal principle, or on some kind 
of confederal principle, does that mean that Croatia would still 
form a confederation with that kind of Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Granic] Croatia has political, strategic, and economic 
interests in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is perfectly clear today 
that this is also the West's strategic interest. This has never 
been defined more clearly than now. I believe that Croatia has 
firmly decided to take that step -- both by signing and by 
today's statement by President Tudjman, which has been well 
received throughout the world. 
  I can say that in the United States the news about the 
signing [the agreement on confederation] met with almost 
unanimous approval -- among diplomats, in the Security Council, 
and in the United Nations. We will continue along this path. 
It will not be easy. As you can see, there are a lot of 
obstacles that need to be overcome successfully, and this is why 
we said that this was the first -- important and historic -- but 
only the first step. 
  [Merlic] To end this interview, I have a question about the 
guarantees and promises that the United States and the 
international community have made to Croatia. Primarily, the 
most interesting one is a certain guarantee that the occupied 
areas of Croatia will be returned under Croatia's sovereignty. 
There is also financial assistance and the cooperation in 
military issues, namely, membership in NATO's Partnership for 
Peace. Have any of these guarantees been put down on paper? 
  [Granic] The guarantees have not been put down on paper, but 
they are being discussed. In the talks I have had with Vice 
President Gore, General Shalikashvili, Defense Secretary Perry, 
and State Secretary Christopher, we discussed all this in more 
detail than you mentioned here. This is not all. Access to 
financial institutions, such as the World Bank and the IMF, will 
be opened up to us. The public knows that some loans have been 
blocked for political reasons. That is one group of offers. 
The other one is the European Union. Talks on this are under 
way; very intensive talks. [passage omitted: EU to discuss 
Bosnia on Monday] 
  [Granic] What is the most interesting for us, of course, is 
the reintegration of the UN protected areas into Croatia's state 
and legal system. I discussed this with the UN secretary 
general. We will put our proposal in writing by mid-March, and 
demand guarantees and support from the United States and EU, 
from all important international factors. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman today received 
Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special envoy and 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] coordinator for former 
Yugoslavia, and his associates, the president's office announced. 
  Recalling that the UNPROFOR mandate [in Croatia] was 
expiring 
at the end of this month, Tudjman said Croatia would not agree 
to renew the mandate under present conditions. He emphasized 
that UNPROFOR supervision in the protected areas was 
insufficient, the best proof of which was the latest incident 
involving the downing of Serb aircraft which took off from 
protected areas in the Republic of Croatia. Special Envoy 
Akashi said the UN secretary general would inform the Security 
Council about the implementation of UNPROFOR's mandate in 
Croatia by the end of the month. 
  Speaking about the Croat-Muslim Washington agreement, 
President Tudjman said the entire geopolitical situation has 
changed as a result of this and international and Croatian 
efforts would now be directed towards the solving of the problem 
of the reintegration of protected areas into the constitutional 
and legal system of the country. 
  In conclusion, President Tudjman stressed that the problem 
no 
longer lies in the territorial settlement between the three 
nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but that a division between East 
and West has now surfaced, whose interests have always clashed 
in this area, the president's office has announced.

  [Text] Podgorica, 4 Mar (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic, president 
of the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK), denied in today's POBJEDA 
that the downed planes had taken off from RSK territory. 
  "It is out of the question that our planes from Udbine were 
flying over the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Srpska 
republic. Our own airspace is sufficient for us, and we have no 
need for any Air Force activities over those areas." 
  "We do not want to interfere in the fighting between our 
brothers from the Srpska republic and the Muslims, knowing that 
our brothers have enough strength and knowledge to resist the 
Muslims, who, particularly in recent days, have abused all 
cease-fires for new armed actions against the Serbs," Martic 
said. 
  He said that the misinformation about the RSK military 
activities over the former Bosnia-Herzegovina had originated 
from BORBA.

<F P=106> [Article by Branko Podgornik: "Will the Left Soon Recover?"] </F>
  [Text] The first obvious sign of recovery of the Croatian 
left has recently emerged. Four years after the beginning of 
the collapse of the former Communist Party, something new is 
trying to grow out of its ruins. Ivica Racan's Social Democratic 
Party of Croatia (SDP), created from a reformist faction in the 
former regime party, has united with Antun Vujic's Social 
Democratic Party (SDH), which was established in 1989 in 
opposition to the former regime. 
  The long-announced gathering of leftist social democrats is 
nevertheless starting to get under way, and some 10 days ago, 
leaders of both parties publicly confirmed that. They present 
themselves as two factions on the left of center Croatian 
political scene: social democrats from the former ruling party 
and social democrats from the opposition, and they advocate an 
independent and democratic Croatia. 
<H5>  Without the Third Side </H5>
  However, with the appearance of a third movement on the 
left, 
which primarily includes Branko Horvat's Social Democratic Union 
(SDU), they will not and cannot unite. They think the third is 
continuing the work of conservative forces from the former 
regime, regarding the idea of a form of Yugoslav community, 
which see the creation of the Croatian state as a necessary 
evil. The Socialist Party of Croatia (SSH), headed by Silvije 
Degen, is a fourth leftist party, but Croatian social democrats 
have noticed that the Socialists wander between them and the 
SDU, and that they do not want to take sides. 
  It is impossible to unite all the leftist parties because, 
even since 1990, the deepest polarization in Croatia is situated 
exactly to the left of the political center. Those who advocate 
Croatia are on one side of this front line and those who 
advocate Yugoslavia or invoke its spirits are on the other. 
  Observers say that the attempt to unite everything that 
exists left of center would look like an attempt to glue 
together the former Croatian League of Communists: As though it 
were being attempted to shut a cat and a dog in the same cage 
and put the well- known curse on the left: May you have to deal 
with yourself! People say that that would continue to prevent 
the left from developing into a force that could mean something 
on the Croatian political scene. 
  But many still insist on uniting the ununitable. Some 
members of the SDP claim that some do it naively wishing for the 
left to get stronger, but the road to hell is often paved with 
the best of intentions. Some think that uniting all the leftist 
parties is being encouraged by some circles in the HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Community] and outside it -- those who want to weaken 
the left fearing it could get back to power in Croatia as well, 
as has already happened in many Eastern European countries. If 
the advocates of compromised ideas were to belong to one party, 
people say that the ruling party would find it easier to deal 
with the left, while the existing Racan's and especially Vujic's 
social democrats are a bit harder to control now. 
<H5>  Identity Crisis </H5>
  Furthermore, people say that insisting on merging all the 
leftist parties is beneficial for some circles in the SDU and 
the SSH, as that part of the left is undergoing an identity 
crisis. A new identity can easily be found if they come closer 
to the social democrats, who acquire and want to continue to 
acquire an identity and legitimacy first of all with the 
Croatian nation. At former state and local elections, the SDP 
got the biggest share of the 9 percent of votes for the left. 
  Ivica Racan is claiming these days that "the attempt to 
unite 
everything leftist in one party would marginalize the left and 
then also marginalize and eliminate the SDP. I will not agree 
to that, and I believe that I am supported by most people in the 
party." 
  Some observers explain why it would be good for, for example 
"the far left" headed by Branko Horvat, which Stipe Suvar likes 
as well, to suppress the SDP, and especially to suppress Ivica 
Racan. In 1990, when he was a member of the SDP, Horvat 
criticized Racan for intending to give the SDP the name of 
social democrats but a couple of years later he changed his mind 
and started advocating social democratic concepts himself. "Far 
left" circles reproached Racan for having a poor strategy, with 
being "the grave-digger of the party," with "betraying the 
Serbs" after the first democratic elections, and the like. 
  Indeed, after getting almost 30 percent of the votes at the 
elections in 1990, the SDP got only some 5 percent at the 
elections in 1992. It became evident that the party had reached 
an all time low, but it survived, recovered, and is now 
preparing to move slowly upward. These days one often hears the 
old anti- communists complimenting former communist Ivica Racin 
on his way of leading the party; they appreciate his political 
experience, and sometimes refer to the SDP as "polite civic 
party, which has contributed to democracy and inter-Croatian 
reconciliation." 
  An observer has remarked that Racan's adversaries from the 
left could now be forced to admit that Racan was right in some 
things and that he "has not become history like some of his 
critics who were tied up by history." 
<H5>  Racan or Tripalo </H5>
  The same observer continues that it is difficult to admit 
that owing to personal vanity, and some are quietly trying to 
push Racan away from the leading position in the SDP, including 
members of his own party. Lately, they have welcomed references 
to Mika Tripalo as a possible president of the united left, for 
that would make it easier to do away with Racan and the SDP. 
Still, our source claims that Racan and Tripalo are not in 
conflict, they recently had a long talk behind closed doors and 
cleared up matters, and they are also publicly praising each 
other. 
  Indeed, in the last couple of months, Racan himself has 
considered withdrawing from the leading position into the party 
shadows. However, VJESNIK's source continues, "now Racan, too, 
is displaying a kind of vanity. He does not want to be written 
off but wants to prove that he can not only preserve the party 
but also stimulate its growth, and that has lately become 
evident. In that, he is supported by most members of the SDP; 
he is even being pushed by them." 
  All in all, after the successful party reform, which Racan 
carried out by relying on the so-called youth line, the SDP is 
now trying to make a step forward on the Croatian political 
scene. With a refreshed and rejuvenated leadership, the SDP 
wants to be the center of the Croatian democratic left, which 
will spread toward the center. As a sign of that, members of 
the party claim, they decided to unite with the SDH, whose 
members did not hide their political inclinations toward the 
reformists in the SDP. Antun Vujic claims he finds it easier to 
talk to members of earlier factions of the SDP than with Racan 
himself. 
  Circles close to the SDP and the SDH claim it is soon to be 
expected that many prominent men will publicly support the 
unification of social democrats in order to help them develop 
politically. Observers say that Racan is counting on young 
people in his party in particular to carry forward social 
democratic ideas, and that there are such people in the SDH as 
well, for the unburdened generation can suppress conflicts in 
the party that mostly originated in the past and that are 
directed toward the past instead of the present. 
  A young member of the SDP, now in the party leadership, says 
it was most difficult for him in the election campaign of 1990. 
At that time, new Croatian parties were setting up their stalls 
on Jelacic Square and selling party materials and symbols. "I 
was standing behind the SDP stand, and the HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Community] stands were to the left and to the right 
of me and people were fighting to get to them while no one came 
to me except for old ladies and stool pigeons. One of them 
shouted: `And where is your famous equipment -- the hammer and 
sickle?' I replied sadly they had been stolen by some people 
from the HDZ. When the war begin, I volunteered. Of course, it 
was difficult for me at the front lines as well, but easier than 
on Jelacic Square in 1990."

<F P=106> [Interview with Kiro Gligorov, president of The Former </F>
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, by Yeoryios Kharvalias at 
the presidential villa in Skopje on 1 March 1994] 
  [Excerpts] [Kharvalias] Mr. President, what did you 
discuss with the German alternate foreign minister [title as 
published]? 
  [Gligorov] We discussed the more general problems of the 
Balkans and above all our confrontation with Greece! The 
problems caused us by the Greek trade blockade. I must note 
with satisfaction that the German Government was absolutely 
categorical about the illegal nature of these measures and the 
dangers they pose for stability in the region. At this point, I 
would like to thank German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel for the 
relevant remarks that he recently made in Athens... 
  [Kharvalias] Have you gotten any specific commitments of 
political or economic support from the German side? 
  [Gligorov] First of all, we noted our mutual desire to 
strengthen bilateral relations, particularly economic and trade 
relations, as well as technical aid. However, we did not 
discuss any specific plan for economic support by Bonn. We 
pointed out once again the stated desire by the German side to 
help the "Republic of Macedonia." [passage omitted] 
  [Kharvalias] However, it appeared last spring that Greece 
and 
Skopje, with the exception of the name, had reached a 
significant rapprochement--a compromise on the emblems, the 
flag, and so forth. What has happened since then? 
  [Gligorov] After the adoption of the relevant Security 
Council resolution, which was a particularly positive 
development, there were exceptionally useful discussions at the 
United Nations under the auspices of Cyrus Vance and David Owen. 
I believe that substantive progress was made at those talks, 
there was a substantive rapprochement between the two sides. 
  But after that, the elections were held in Greece, the 
negotiations stopped and later, instead of resuming them as 
would be natural, the new Greek Government announced their 
suspension! Moreover, it set the three well-known conditions! 
  I believe this is not a creative approach for two 
neighboring 
countries such as Greece and "Macedonia," which are not facing 
very serious problems. Instead of understanding, we have a 
unilateral embargo without a Security Council decision having 
been made in advance as was the case with Serbia. 
  I must stress that we have not resorted to any 
countermeasure 
and so far people and goods from Greece enter our territory 
without any restrictions. 
  [Kharvalias] But Greece is the only country that guarantees 
your territorial integrity. What are you doing as a goodwill 
gesture? 
  [Gligorov] But we have made goodwill gestures! We have 
amended our Constitution with a clause that says that we do not 
have territorial claims against any of our neighbors and, 
moreover, we added the provision that we will never interfere in 
the internal affairs of neighboring countries. 
  In addition, even in my recent letter to Greek Prime 
Minister 
Andreas Papandreou I stated that we are prepared to sign a 
treaty with Greece on the inviolability of borders which, if 
necessary, could be guaranteed by the European Union and/or the 
United Nations! 
  I remind you that during the former embargo by the 
Konstandinos Mitsotakis administration we did not resort to 
countermeasures. We do not have the slightest intention to take 
reprisals against neighboring Greece. We merely view the whole 
situation with regret because we seek friendly relations with 
Greece and the Greek people. [passage omitted] 
  [Kharvalias] By any chance did Alternate German Foreign 
Minister Helmut Schaefer urge you to make another goodwill 
gesture toward the Greek side? 
  [Gligorov] We were not given such advice or recommendation. 
I believe that most of the European Union ministers realize 
that we have already made many concessions. The dialogue will 
have to begin at some time. 
  [Kharvalias] When was your latest contact with a Greek 
politician? 
  [Gligorov] I am very sorry because I have never had any 
contacts with Greek politicians, although at the first moment of 
the crisis I sent a letter to Athens for a meeting with then 
Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis. I have never received 
any answer. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Stanislaw Grzymski from Delhi: "Walesa in India"] </F>
  [Text] The heads of state who visit Delhi are not greeted 
at the airport. Immediately on landing, President Lech Walesa, 
his wife, and the members of the Polish Government delegation 
went to the residence in Rashtrapati (presidential palace). 
  The official part of the visit began on Thursday [3 March] 
at 
0900 in the courtyard of the Rashtrapati palace, built in 1929 
for the viceroy of the British Crown. The building, which has 
240 rooms, is now the residence of the Indian president and 
houses the chancellery and the office of the government. The 
Polish delegation was greeted by President Shankar Dayal Sharma 
and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. 
  President Walesa announced that Polish-Indian relations need 
to become more dynamic. 
  Next, the Polish delegation went to Radzghat, the place 
where 
the body of Mahatma Gandhi was cremated; Gandhi was murdered on 
30 January 1948, less than a year after India proclaimed its 
independence. In line with the tradition, Lech Walesa placed a 
wreath on the memorial plate in the mausoleum and planted a tree 
in the garden nearby. 
  Afterward, he met with President Sharma in the Rashtrapati 
Palace. The presidents discussed, among other things, 
similarities in striving for independence of Poland and India. 
Sharma compared Poland's "Solidarity" period to the period when 
India fought for independence. Walesa stressed that Mahatma 
Gandhi was a model for Poles to follow in achieving political 
aims without resorting to force. 
  President Walesa also met with a group of Indian Parliament 
deputies, during which both parties discussed economic 
development. The president also familiarized himself with the 
system of legislative powers in India, which was based on the 
British model, but adjusted to Indian reality. 
  On Thursday, talks were held also by Polish Foreign Affairs 
Minister Andrzej Olechowski and his Indian counterpart, Dinesh 
Siagh. 
  During a party given in honor of the Polish guests by the 
Indian president, Lech Walesa stated that there are great 
possibilities for increasing trade cooperation, which, in recent 
years, has plummeted to a level that does not correspond to the 
potential and interests of both states. 
  The visit of the president of the Polish Republic to India 
aroused considerable interest in Indian business circles. The 3 
March issue of THE TIMES OF INDIA, the largest Indian daily, 
published a report on the situation and economic reforms in 
Poland, sponsored by companies interested in trade contacts with 
our country. Under the headline "Welcome His Excellency Lech 
Walesa and Danuta Walesa," the companies included their offers.

<F P=106> [Article by Rafal Szubstarski: "Markiewicz, Consider </F>
Yourself Dismissed"] 
  [Text] On 1 March, President Lech Walesa dismissed Marek 
Markiewicz from the post of chairman of the Radio and Television 
Broadcasting Council, claiming that Markiewicz had violated the 
law on radio and television broadcasting. 
  Markiewicz learned of his dismissal at 1345 yesterday [1 
March], one hour after a news conference at which he had 
publicly signed a document awarding PolSat Television a license 
to operate a nationwide television channel. Loss of the 
chairmanship of this Broadcasting Council does not mean loss of 
membership thereof, and Markiewicz is still a member. His 
duties, however, have been taken over by the hitherto deputy 
chairman, Maciej Ilowiecki. 
  Ilowiecki was angry when he heard the news about Markiewicz. 
"That just shows how democracy works in this country," he said. 
"The president had no right to dismiss the chairman. That can 
only be done jointly by the Sejm, the Senate, and the president, 
and only if the president rejects a report by the Council or the 
chairman breaks the law on broadcasting. Therefore, I await 
evidence of such an offense." 
  Andrzej Drzycimski, the presidential spokesman, said that 
the 
decision to recall Markiewicz was dictated by the fact that 
"Markiewicz had failed to observe the provisions of the law on 
radio and television broadcasting." According to Drzycimski, 
the Council wanted to grant PolSat a broadcasting monopoly. 
"Among the evidence of this is that PolSat was to be awarded a 
license to operate a nationwide channel and satellite channels 
at the same time, and was to be allocated regional frequencies," 
Drzycimski wrote in a communique. 
  Drzycimski claims that Markiewicz's plan to merge local 
stations into larger networks is also a violation of the 
broadcasting law. Drzycimski did not mention PolSat by name but 
referred to all of the stations owned by Zygmunt Solorz, owner 
of PolSat. The president has already criticized the 
Broadcasting Council several times for granting PolSat a 
nationwide television license. 
  Drzycimski's communique also mentions the controversial 
issue 
of documents on the subject of the companies that were competing 
for broadcasting licenses. The State Protection Office [UOP] is 
said to have conveyed these documents to Markiewicz before he 
made his final choice as to who would be awarded the 
broadcasting license. Drzycimski also claimed that Markiewicz 
was in the possession of material on the subject of some of the 
broadcasting license applicants that "gives reason to believe 
that there is a possible danger to state security." 
  During the news conference, Markiewicz said that the UOP 
material contained virtually nothing that could disqualify 
Solorz in the eyes of the Broadcasting Council. He said there 
was certainly nothing on Solarz in the papers he received from 
the prime minister before the final choice was made, and nothing 
in the unofficial material he received from a high-ranking UOP 
official almost at the very last moment. "This unofficial 
material, which was not even signed, contained observations that 
discredited four applicants for the broadcasting license, but 
Solorz was not one of them. There was some speculation about 
Solorz. That is all," said Markiewicz. 
  In the opinion of UOP spokesman Irena Popoff, from all of 
the 
documents he had received, Markiewicz could not have known any 
more about the applicants than the president and the prime 
minister. 
  According to the prime minister's press secretary, Ewa 
Wachowicz, the UOP material supplied to the prime minister did 
not question PolSat's eligibility to apply for the broadcasting 
license. 
  Markiewicz admitted that, on the day the license was 
awarded, 
he had held a bitter conversation with the president. Lech 
Walesa had accused him of accepting a bribe from Solarz. "As a 
Solidarity member, I find that accusation scandalous," said 
Markiewicz. 
  On Tuesday [1 March], at 1500 hours, the Broadcasting 
Council, already informed of Markiewicz's demise, presented, in 
the presence of journalists, PolSat representatives with 
PolSat's broadcasting license. The license was signed by 
Markiewicz and by the Council's deputy chairman, Maciej 
Ilowiecki. 
  Asked to comment on Lech Walesa's negative decision 
concerning him, Markiewicz said: "As a member of the 
Broadcasting Council, I am not at liberty to comment on 
decisions by the head of state. I received news of this 
decision at 1345, and I acknowledged it, which does not mean 
that I immediately began to study the broadcasting law. The law 
says that the president appoints the chairman of the Council but 
does not say who dismisses him." 
  Andrzej Zarebski, secretary to the Council, said that the 
Council has resolved unanimously to petition the Supreme Court, 
the Constitutional Tribunal, and the Sejm to investigate whether 
the president has the right to dismiss the chairman of the 
Broadcasting Council. According to Professor Stanislaw Piatek, a 
media expert, the broadcasting law fails to define the precise 
manner in which the chairman of the Broadcasting Council is 
dismissed.

<F P=106> [Article by B.I.W.: "Solidarity Announces Surprise Strikes"] </F>
  [Text] The first strike, a strike of railway workers 
lasting at least 10 days, is supposed to be one of the "more 
cumbersome" for the people," the "Solidarity" ["S"] leadership 
admitted during a Thursday [3 March] press conference. 
  Passenger trains will be stopped for one day. When will that 
be? We will find out from the posters at railway stations. At 
any rate, "on Monday [7 March] people can still travel by 
train," said Railway "S" head Krzysztof Maminski. A few days 
following this strike, there is supposed to be "a long strike, 
blocking freight traffic and thus paralyzing the economy, but it 
will not be cumbersome to the people." 
  "S" merely says that the strike action will be conducted by 
the plants of the metal branch, energy, mining, communications, 
and railways, as well as selected regions, districts, and 
enterprises. "S" will not reveal who will go on strike, when, 
and for how long. It is going to reveal the details no more than 
10 hours before the strikes actually begin because "all of the 
things that have been practiced on the union before are starting 
all over again." "Traveling all over the country are gentlemen 
with attache cases who put out strikes and promise wonders," 
said National Committee Spokesman Piotr Zak. 
  Asked whether the people will bear the costs of the "S" 
action, Zak gave assurances that, even though "strikes are 
always cumbersome," they will try to "limit this 
cumbersomeness": "One can, for example, imagine limiting energy 
supplies not to private houses and apartments but only to 
offices...." 
  "Will the central administration be paralyzed?" journalists 
asked. 
  "Now, has it not been paralyzed already?" replied "S" Head 
Marian Krzaklewski. 
  Miners are planning three forms of the strike: They will not 
go underground; they will, but they will not work, or they will 
work, but they will not sell the coal. "The purpose of our 
strike is not to overthrow the government or this political 
configuration," said Silesian "S" Head Marek Kempski. 
  On 7 March, the "S" action is supposed to begin with a 
collection of money for the strikers. Not only "S" members but 
all of the people participating in the strike will be entitled 
to remuneration for the strike. 
  Asked whether the trade union is strong enough to undertake 
such a large-scale action, Krzaklewski replied that "all of the 
structures in Poland are going through an organizational crisis; 
however, in comparison with others, we are effective; hence the 
fight with the union." He also evaluated that the determination 
of the work force is so great that, "if our union and each plant 
had a strike fund, they would all go on strike." 
  He is not afraid of chaos. "I am afraid of a 200,000-person 
demonstration in Warsaw. I would not like the people to go out 
on the streets; therefore, I prefer that they protest in their 
plants," said Krzaklewski. 
  "S" will not conclude any branch or regional agreement, if 
talks on all-national demands of the entire union are not held. 
Neither will it respect any agreement signed by the union, if 
it does not include the all-national demands. Krzaklewski added 
that, since November 1992, the union had been in collective 
bargaining with the government, concerning compensation for the 
costs of living; Silesia demanded that in its strike, and now 
"S" has the full right to go on a general strike. "This time we 
will complete our action when decisions, not paperwork 
agreements, are made." 
  The Cegielski Factory in Poznan will not take part in the 
"S" 
strike. Marek Lenartowski, head of the plant "S," which belongs 
to the "Network," said that "a strike will pour oil on the 
flames," and the planned action is "an ambition-dictated 
activity of the chairman and the union leadership."

  [Text] Wroclaw, 4 Mar--At a news conference in Wroclaw 
today, Tomasz Wojcik, chairman of the Lower Silesian Solidarity 
Region, stated that there would be no strike action in Wroclaw 
on 7 March. 
  Wojcik said that if there were a strike staged at a later 
date in Wroclaw, the action would be carried out in the most 
unconventional manner, "which would cause disruption, especially 
to the authorities." Among other things, there will be 
disruption in telephone services or cuts in central heating in 
municipal offices, as well as in those institutions that provide 
services for the government.

  [Text] The Prosecutor's Office in Warsaw has begun an 
investigation into irregularities committed by employees of the 
Finance Ministry in setting the price of shares of Bank Slaski. 
  As we were told by prosecutor Ryszard Kucinski, who is 
leading the investigation, these are, for the time being, 
proceedings in a case and not against any specific people. 
  The prosecutor's office decided to begin an investigation 
only after two months from the date that the Confederation of 
Republicans tabled a formal notice regarding the crime. In the 
opinion of the confederation, the price of the Bank Slaski 
shares had been seriously lowered and the Treasury had been the 
loser. 
  A second motion asking for an investigation was tabled on 26 
January by the Inspection Office of the Stocks Commission. This 
motion concerned the possible overestimate of the market price 
of shares at the first two sessions. 
  Another line of investigation is to answer the question of 
how the process of setting the share price was carried out.

<F P=106> [Report by Marina Roman and Bogdan Tiberiu Iacob on </F>
statements by party leaders regarding the government formula: 
"Will the PDSR, CDR, and PD(FSN) Smoke a `Peace Pipe'?"] 
  [Text] CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania]: "We are 
not interested in participating in the government, but in the 
application of our anticrisis program!" 
  PD(FSN) [Democratic Party-National Salvation Front]: "A PDSR 
government supported by the opposition is possible, but only on 
the basis of a well-defined political pact." 
  PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania]: "A PDSR monocolor 
government is viable, but for no longer than six months." 
  Last week's meeting of the CDR leaders projected an 
original, 
even thrilling, alternative to the forefront of the political 
arena by bearing in mind the savage post-revolutionary duels 
between those in power and those in the opposition: the 
possibility of a political pact between the main parliamentary 
blocs -- CDR, PD(FSN), and PDSR, with a view to supporting a 
monocolor, reformist government of the ruling party. It is more 
than obvious that in the current domestic and international 
situation, this offer of "smoking a peace pipe" would be, from 
several points of view, the best solution. What remains to be 
seen -- after the negotiations that will soon be held -- is to 
what extent this can be put into practice, because Romania's 
very future is at stake. Here are some opinions by a few 
leaders of the parties involved in this question: 
  Emil Constantinescu, CDR president: "After more than two 
months of so-called negotiations, the PDSR has reached the 
conclusion that there is nothing to change and it is proposing a 
new minority government. Thus we are asking ourselves where is 
that national interest that even Mr. Adrian Nastase places above 
party interests, as he says? Only after the PDSR allies had 
launched an utterly irresponsible blackmail campaign by 
attacking basic state institutions and extending their vulgar 
actions to those in power, actions which up to then had served 
their interests through attacks on the opposition, did the 
ruling party announce that it might consider a reformist 
minority government. As far as we are concerned, we are not 
necessarily interested in participating in government at this 
time, but in applying the CDR program for coming out of the 
crisis. The only possible way is to discuss a tangible program 
with precise elements and deadlines. If we reach an 
understanding on this, we will be able to form a new 
parliamentary majority to support an efficient and competent 
government. Every drawer is full of programs; however, there 
has been no political will to apply them. And as a consequence 
of the activity of the current government, something very 
serious has happened: the political infiltration of the middle 
echelon! Even if we now came up with a competent government, it 
would be difficult for it to implement its program because of 
this middle echelon that has taken shape. Recent differences in 
the leftist wing have clearly demonstrated the infiltration in 
this echelon of antireform-oriented people. This is one of the 
most serious of Romania's problems at this time." 
  Dinu Patriciu, vice president of the Liberal Party '93: "In 
no way will we support a PDSR government, because our objections 
are linked both to the program and to the competence of those 
whom the PDSR can appoint to the government. When I say 
competence, I mean it in its broader sense, that is resulting 
primarily from a certain mentality. And, through its origin and 
political actions, the PDSR has proved that the mentality of its 
people does not permit them to think politically in the sense of 
denationalization, decentralization, debureaucratization, and 
destablization. We have different aims, and thus we can only 
have different policies. A PDSR monocolor government would be a 
catastrophe! As far as Professor Emil Constantinescu's 
statement is concerned, it is of a personal nature and in no way 
the result of discussions within the CDR Executive Committee. 
My opinion is that such a government would not have the 
necessary parliamentary support. Cars that drive down the 
middle of the street are in the way of both those on the left 
and those on the right. 
  Radu Al. Timofte, PDSR senator: A PDSR minority, monocolor 
government is as viable as can be but not for a long time. It 
could not last longer than six months unless a very serious pact 
is concluded with the other parliamentary parties and unless 
this pact is observed by its signatories. 
  Ion Diaconescu, first vice president of the National Peasant 
Christian Democratic Party: During the Convention, we decided 
not to change the attitude that we have had so far, and to 
preserve our uncompromising stance. We will participate in 
government only if the PDSR renounces its monopoly on state 
power. As for parliamentary support, which the CDR and PD(FSN) 
could grant to a PDSR minority government, I can tell you only 
that we will support, as we have done so far, only those laws 
that in our view are objective, beneficial, and reformist, and 
we will reject the others. Within our alliance, however, there 
are reservations about a possible so-called opening by the 
current power toward the opposition." 
  Adrian Severin, PD vice president: "When we talk about a 
viable PDSR government, I think that it has to be clear that we 
are not referring to the current government. We will not 
support a government against which we have supported two censure 
motions and two simple motions. A minority, monocolor PDSR 
government -- other than the Vacaroiu government -- supported by 
the current opposition, that is the CDR and PD, is possible, but 
only on the basis of an explicit political pact that will define 
the national interests, the ways and means to accelerate and 
intensify the reform process, the way to isolate extremist 
political forces and stop their access to the levers of power, 
as well as guarantees for the operation of democratic 
institutions. Such a formula does not mean a political alliance 
between the PDSR-CDR-PD, but just a way to cooperate at a time 
of crisis."

<F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "The Issue of a Minority </F>
Government"] 
  [Text] Recent events have made the fate of the current 
government coalition really uncertain. Certainly, the PSM 
[Socialist Party of Labor] and the PRM [Greater Romania Party] 
referred in their public statements only to the issue of 
freezing negotiations with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of 
Romania] on forming a new government. They refrained from 
commenting on their parliamentary alliance with the PDSR, an 
alliance that resulted in the Nicolae Vacaroiu cabinet. As far 
as the government party is concerned, it did not adopt a 
categorical position regarding an alliance with the PSM and the 
PRM. The response to the PRM letter is a declaration that, 
although intended for the entire left wing on our political 
spectrum, its conclusion merely refers to the issue of 
negotiations aimed at establishing a government of the so called 
red pentagon. At a first glance one might say that the current 
signs that relations between the PDSR and the PSM-PRM have 
cooled refer only to the plan for a PDSR-PSM-PRM-PUNR-PDAR 
[Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania] government and will not 
affect the current discreet alliance, an alliance through which 
we have today in parliament a left-wing majority coalition. 
Using a simple metaphor, we might say that the PDSR broke off 
negotiations for a marriage with the PSM-PRM. However, the 
engagement is still on. To think in this way strikes me as a 
little risky. During the quarrel on the issue of negotiations, 
enough curses were exchanged for not only the marriage but even 
the engagement to be thrown into doubt. Just as in every 
dispute, the sides reached a stage when they expressed exactly 
what they thought about each other. However, in a love affair, 
any separation starts from the first real quarrel. In that 
moment, the two sides threw into each other's face everything 
that they had kept hidden before. And even if they make up 
later, the memory of that moment of sincerity will seriously 
affect their relationship. A similar thing will also happen to 
the government coalition. The controversy on the issue of 
negotiations aimed at establishing the pentagon gave the 
partners the opportunity to express what they thought about each 
other. Not only they but also the public could notice that, 
beneath the embraces and kisses that have been exchanged so far, 
serious differences are hidden. At the same time, one should 
remember something else. The bickering with the PSM-PRM 
produced an opportunity for certain clarifications within the 
PDSR. As is known, the PDSR is dominated by disputes between 
its two groups, namely, the reformist and the conservative ones. 
As long as the PSM-PRM had cast their eyes at the PDSR, the 
reformist group did not have a chance firmly to put forward the 
issue of separation from nationalist-communist forces. Every 
time the conservative group invoked a reason -- which did not 
lack common sense -- namely, that it is preferable to have a 
stable alliance with the left wing than a hypothetical and 
uncertain alliance with the right wing. The PRM letter gave the 
opportunity to the reform group to take its revenge. The 
hooligan and absolutely irresponsible behavior of [PRM leader] 
Corneliu Vadim Tudor toward President Ion Iliescu was used by 
the reformist group to demonstrate to the whole party how 
dangerous an alliance with nationalist-communists is. Faced 
with such a shattering argument, the conservative group was 
compelled to give in. This can be seen in the style and content 
of the PDSR declaration, which indicates the victory of the 
position adopted by the reformist group. From this viewpoint, 
there is no doubt that PRM Leader Corneliu Vadim Tudor has made 
a decisive contribution to the victory of the reformist group in 
the PDSR. With his stupid articles, he strengthened that group 
of the ruling party that had been advocating for quite a long 
time a break with the left-wing allies and an opening toward the 
CD and the PD(FSN) [Democratic Party(National Salvation Front)]. 
Even if neither the PDSR nor the PSM-PRM could comment on the 
current coalition, it is clear that under these circumstances, 
its days are numbered. Does a possible break of the left-wing 
coalition endanger the PDSR's government? Although it might 
seem paradoxical, the answer is no. The PDSR has every chance 
to form a government with a minority executive and rule for a 
while. The fall of the government would depend on the success 
of a censure motion. However, such a situation would mean early 
elections. And such prospects frighten not only all the parties 
but all the members of parliament as well. What member would 
dare, at a secret ballot required by the censure motion, to vote 
for the fall of the government and early elections? This would 
mean to make his future status as a member uncertain. Thus, it 
is not excluded that in the near future we are going to have a 
minority PDSR government, supported by both the right and the 
left wing.

<F P=106> [Sorin Rosca Stanescu report: "Accused of Espionage"] </F>
  [Text] Last week Traian Basescu, former transportation 
minister in the Petre Roman cabinet [and currently a member of 
the Chamber of Deputies for the Democratic Party-National 
Salvation Front -- PD-FSN], voiced accusations unprecedented in 
Romania's history. According to him, representatives of the 
executive and the presidential institution passed secret 
information about the Petromin fleet to Greek intelligence 
General Nikos Grylakis [name as published]. In that context the 
PD-FSN deputy named Paul Teodoru, current transportation 
minister, and [General] Vasile Ionel, counselor of President Ion 
Iliescu. The presidential counselor is supposed to have 
personally handed over a file containing secret information to 
the Greek general. Basescu claims that the information had been 
previously obtained from Petromin Director Romanuel Posedaru. 
  Until now the representatives of the government, as well as 
those of the presidential institution, have not officially 
denied anything. 
  The press remained speechless when it learned about the 
accusations of such gravity. If the accusations are sustained 
by evidence, the Petromin-Forum Maritime scandal will eventually 
be cleared up by simply revealing the details of an espionage 
affair the perpetrators of which are top officials in Bucharest 
and Athens. 
  Here are some details for our readers. The persons directly 
accused or merely hinted at by Basescu are: General Nikos 
Grylakis, the man who in 1993 triggered "the scandal of the 
century" in Athens, Stellos Katounis, owner of the Forum 
Maritime company, and the Palestinian Fathi Mohamad Taher [name 
as published], the owner of the Elite restaurant in Bucharest, 
the Greek business adversary of the previous two persons, the 
shipping tycoon Iannis Alafouzos, who also owns a number of 
radio and television networks, while on the Bucharest side of 
the affair they are Paul Teodoru and General Vasile Ionel. On a 
secondary plane the names of Konstandinos Mitsotakis, the former 
prime minister of Greece, Nicolae Vacaroiu, the head of the 
executive in Bucharest, and Ion Iliescu have also been mentioned. 
  If Basescu's allegations are true, the center figure of the 
whole affair is General Grylakis. His career came to an end in 
September 1993, previous to which he held the office of Prime 
Minister Mitsotakis' counselor for security and defense issues. 
Born on the isle of Crete he later graduated from the Military 
Academy and the War Academy. He was specially trained by the 
Mosad (Israel's intelligence service.) During the 1967 military 
dictatorship he was the head of the Greek secret service. In 
1989 he organized an illegal network to tap the telephone 
conversations of various Greek political figures and gather 
information about them. Three years ago he set up the Bureau 
for Balkan Affairs. He had contacts with many Balkan leaders. 
He publicly claimed that he supported and influenced things to 
have Ion Iliescu elected as president. For that service, 
according to the Greek press, in 1993 he received a medal in 
Bucharest. Iliescu does not deny this. In the same year Premier 
Vacaroiu invites him to Snagov to celebrate the conclusion of 
the Petromin-Forum Maritime deal. He is a friend of Stellos 
Katounis and the Palestinian Taher (both of whom have very tight 
business connections with Moscow), and an enemy of Andreas 
Papandreou, the current Greek prime minister, and of Alafouzos, 
the influential shipping tycoon, who last September managed to 
bring General Grylakis to justice. 
  In the same month [September 1993] our daily already 
signaled, for the first time, that he is involved in the 
Petromin-Forum Maritime deal. From first-class Greek sources 
(who for the time being wish to remain anonymous) we learned 
that immediately after "the scandal of the century" erupted in 
Athens, General Grylakis made an unexpected move: In exchange 
for the extinguishing of the conflict he offered a number of 
confidential documents to his adversaries. Among those 
documents was the file referred to by Basescu and which contains 
evidence regarding the involvement of top Romanian officials in 
an espionage affair. In those documents Grylakis describes in 
detail the persons from whom he obtained classified information 
and how. 
  Basescu's accusations are so serious that they place the 
Romanian intelligence services in a difficult position. The 
Foreign Information Service, the Romanian Intelligence Service 
[SRI], and UM 0215 (the Intelligence Service of the Ministry of 
Interior) are now compelled to urgently provide answers to the 
Romanian public.

<F P=106> [Article by Bogdan Chirieac: "Our Integration -- Between </F>
Euphoria and Pragmatism"] 
  [Text] The accord on Romania's association with the 
European Community -- the most important document signed after 
1989 -- was negotiated under the pressure of a deadline. The 
Trilaterale -- Hungary, Poland and the (then) Czechoslovakia -- 
had already concluded their accords one year before Bucharest. 
As a result, the Romania-EC negotiations that began in May 1992 
were concluded very rapidly by sealing the association accord on 
17 November 1992 and its initialing on 1 February 1993 in 
Brussels. The accord will soon become effective after it is 
ratified by the parliaments of "the Twelve." 
  The price that had to be paid for such haste is quite high. 
Romania -- at that time considered "the black sheep" of Eastern 
Europe -- was compelled to accept less advantageous association 
terms than the ones offered to the Trilaterale. As far as 
commerce with agricultural products is concerned -- considered 
to be the most important hard currency source of East European 
countries -- Romania was coerced to declare itself satisfied 
with very little, although in that domain it has the largest 
potential in the whole area. It might be significant that 
during the negotiations conducted in view of concluding the 
accord, Frans Andriessen, the EC commissioner in charge of 
community issues, expressed his "deepest regrets" for the terms 
imposed on Romania in the agricultural chapter. Being more 
confident in their own forces, the Trilaterale countries had put 
up a fierce fight to protect their interests. Dissatisfied with 
the EC terms, Poland and Hungary in 1991 left the negotiating 
table, although, as a matter of fact, the offers made to them by 
the European Community had been much more generous than the ones 
made to our country. The favorite countries of the West 
assessed that they could afford to gamble -- and they won. 
  Surprisingly enough, shortly before the accord on Romania's 
association with the European Union [EU] is to become effective, 
the latter radically changed its stance, offering our country an 
unhoped-for present. During the Athens conference of the EU 
member states' ministers of commerce, EU High Commissioner Sir 
Leon Brittan said that the agricultural terms imposed on Romania 
have to be adjusted to those offered to Hungary, Poland, 
Czechia, and Slovakia. Furthermore, Romania should benefit from 
an even more rapid access to EU markets in order to compensate 
for its one-year delay compared to "the four." 
  This is a remarkable change in the EU's stance with respect 
to Romania. This gesture indicates the fact that the West is 
not prepared to divide East Europe into "first class" and 
"second class" countries. 
  However, pragmatism should prevail over euphoria in the way 
Bucharest views this unexpected offer made by the European 
Union. In other words, it will be easier for us to export 
agricultural products to EU countries, but the problem is 
whether Romanian agriculture has sufficient quantities of such 
products. For the time being, owing to the "priceless" 
contribution of the Ministry of Agriculture, our country has 
gained the status of one of the major importers of basic 
agricultural products (wheat, edible oil, and sugar.) The 
unexpected chance given to us by the European Union should not 
be missed because that would cause delays in the transition 
process, as the country would be deprived of one of its major 
sources of hard currency. It would be a pity if those general 
terms offered by the European Union would end up the same way 
the most-favored-nation status did, namely that we chased that 
status over almost four years just to realize, after we received 
it, that Romania's economy is not sufficiently ripe to make any 
substantial bids on the U.S. market.

<F P=106> [Interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic by </F>
Dragan Colovic; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, we are talking about 
Croatian-Muslim agreement reached in Washington between the 
Croats and Muslims about a joint federation and a confederation 
with Croatia. This agreement, which was reached under the 
auspices of the United States, has been interpreted differently. 
Moreover, there are many reserves about its feasibility 
considering the fierce Muslim-Croatian clashes that have been 
underway for several months already. However, some dilemnas 
still remain and are still appearing. Where, in fact, lies the 
final [words indistinct] when Serbs are completely ignored in 
all this? 
  [Jovanovic] First, this is a bilateral agreement, and the 
war 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina is a (?trilateral) civil war. This is a 
bilateral agreement that was reached with the active help of a 
foreign power, which also sets certain limitations. Finally, 
this is an agreement that, in the way it works, is virtually 
suspending, if not disregarding, the tripartite agreement on the 
union of Bosnia-Herzegovina that was reached at the Geneva 
conference. These are three facts that represent [word 
indistinct] objective limitations on the agreement and cast a 
certain light on the agreement as an independent action that has 
been developing while disregarding, and often contrary to, what 
has so far been done within the Geneva conference and in the 
ancillary efforts, be they within the European Community, by 
Russia, or by some other countries. 
  However, if this bilateral agreement is aimed at a humane 
goal, that is, to extinguish the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
at the moment, the only form of real civil war in Bosnia is the 
war waged between the Muslims and Croats, and if on the basis of 
that result it wants to regulate relations between the Muslims 
and the Croats in a permanent way, not touching on the interests 
and rights of the third, Serb, side, then there will be nothing 
to object to in such an agreement. However, if it has some 
other aims, if it not only left the third side unconsulted, but 
even faced it with an impossible choice between accepting and 
rejecting the agreement -- albeit in case it fails to accept it, 
it would have to be punished for its alleged uncooperativeness 
-- then this agreement could be qualified as the agreement of 
two sides against the third, with the assistance of a major 
power. I would not like to forecast that this may come true, 
but if it nevertheless happens, it will be a big step backward 
in comparison with the present situation and the efforts made 
within Geneva conference for a tripartite, just, and permanent 
end to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In this agreement, we have several elements that warn that 
this offer will be of very little attraction to the Bosnian 
Serbs. The setup of Bosnia-Herzegovina is being returned to the 
canton concept, a concept of several cantons to boot. Central 
authorities are essentially strengthened compared to what was 
envisaged in the constitutional arrangement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union of three republics. And finally, 
what is most important, the question of territorial borders has 
not been mentioned at all, and this setting of borders should be 
done, above all, in close cooperation with the Serbian side. 
The fact that this most-important question, without which there 
is no further work, [words indistinct] in this (?bilateral) 
agreement, is the greatest drawback of this agreement as it 
points to its basic weak point, that is, that it is an agreement 
of two sides and the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is a war of three 
sides. And the third side, which was probably the most 
significant in this situation, was not included in the process 
of agreeing and decision making, so that it remains completely 
unclear as to what further attitude the authors of the agreement 
and the people interested in its implementation are going to 
have toward the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, how could all that reflect on the 
current state of Serbian-Croatian relations? What I have in 
mind is what has been reached in Geneva in the agreement on the 
beginning of normalization of relations between Belgrade and 
Zagreb? 
  [Jovanovic] The decision of the two sides, Serb and 
Croatian, to make the first step in the process of normalization 
represents the result of awareness that without settling 
Serbo-Croatian relations on the whole, there can be no mention 
of any permanent settlement of the situation and stability in 
the Balkans. This awareness is not only this on the Croatian 
and Serbian sides, but also on the side of all other factors who 
are involved in solving the Yugoslav crisis. Therefore, 
logically, this Washington agreement should not suspend the 
agreement between the governments of the FRY and the Republic of 
Croatia on opening offices on both sides, nor should its 
provisions, and particularly its unexpressed aims, confront the 
aims that the opened process of normalization of relations 
between FRY and Croatia wants to reach. 
  However, many unclear points in the Washington agreement, 
above all the unclear point on the question of the further 
treatment of the Serbian side in Bosnia and also the ambiguity 
regarding the attraction [privlacnost] that made Croatia accept 
something it has always categorically rejected so far, commands 
caution as well as an increased carefulness. For any attempt to 
put this agreement into practice or to interpret it as an 
agreement against overall Serbian interests may not only 
aggravate the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also call into 
question the very process of normalization between the FRY and 
the Republic of Croatia. 
  [Colovic] Some people fear that the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina could soon become -- if it is not exactly 
that already -- an arena of competition between the United 
States and Russia for the division of spheres of interest, not 
only in Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia, but, also, starting 
from the war in Bosnia, the competition would spread to the 
entire Balkans. How would you comment on that? 
  [Jovanovic] Well, it cannot be good if the crisis in Bosnia 
would last longer or if it was complicated further. It cannot 
be good for the peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for the interests 
of the neighboring states, and certainly not for the peace and 
stability in the region as a whole. Everybody who thinks 
responsibly about politics is doing everything with a view to 
ending this war as soon as possible and finding a complete, 
just, and permanent solution. 
  However, there are a lot of foreign interests that have, 
after all, brought about the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
pushed its people into the civil war, that have still not been 
satisfied, and that can also expand and be realized only with 
the continuation of the crisis. A quick end to the crisis does 
not suit many of these interests, and particularly not an end 
that would cap the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina and accelerate 
the solution of other aspects of the overall Yugoslav crisis. 
  What is alarming, even after this Washington agreement, 
even though there is plenty of talk about the end of war, peace, 
and political cooperation between some entities, is that we are 
still not close to this goal and that, perhaps, we should fear 
that we will not get all that close to it if the suspicions that 
this agreement means the reanimation of a Muslim-Croatian axis 
against the Serbs on the territories of the former Yugoslavia 
and against the FRY prove to be true. 
  [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, finally, can you say a few words 
about the future of the international conference on former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and former Yugoslavia? Can the latest 
development of events threaten it? Is its mandate changing? I 
am referring primarily to the new initiatives. There has been 
talk about the summit of the five, which, as it is alleged, 
would also be open to others? 
  [Jovanovic] The peace process has so far evolved within the 
framework of the mandate and support of the UN, the European 
Union, and other relevant international factors, primarily the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina factors, understandably. The Washington 
initiative and its fruit, however, are a result of an entirely 
separate treatment of the important segments of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, independent of the framework of this 
peace process and even contrary to the hitherto joint stance and 
of the outcome that was particularly pronounced in the 
constitutional document about the regulation of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina union. In this sense, and bearing this in 
mind, it is difficult to reconcile all these contradictions and 
see a future for the work of the Geneva conference on the basis 
of the Washington document. One thing should have been 
clarified beforehand, namely, either to establish the end of the 
so-called Owen-Stoltenberg plan or to announce the birth of a 
new plan, a new method, and a new approach that is expressed in 
the Washington document. 
  On the other hand, there is the Russian initiative, which 
departs from the responsibility of the five biggest states and 
does not negate and oppose the results of the Geneva process, 
but, on the contrary, wishes to accelerate the completion of the 
construction of peace on the basis of these results. However, 
the United States' reserve toward the Russian initiative has now 
materialized and it is now evident why the United States failed 
to support this initiative -- because it was preparing to launch 
its own initiative without the participation of others, and, in 
our case, without consulting the Serbian side. 
  [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, in the name of the listeners of the 
Argument Vise [Argument More] program, thank you very much. 
  [Jovanovic] Thank you, too.

  [Excerpts] Belgrade, 4 Mar (TANJUG) -- The Government of 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] at its session today 
concluded that Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kontic's visit to 
New York was successful and useful, the Federal Ministry of 
Information has announced. A statement from the session says: 
  The federal government at its session today examined and 
endorsed a report on the working visit by Yugoslav Prime 
Minister Kontic to New York between 15 and 19 February this year. 
  It was concluded that the visit was successful and useful 
and 
that it took place at a critical time of expiry of NATO 
ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, which was reflected in the 
topics of his meetings and talks. [passage omitted] 
  The federal government tasked the relevant departments with 
drawing up a platform regarding possibilities of developing 
Yugoslav-U.S. cooperation under the sanctions and after the 
lifting or the alleviation of the sanctions, taking into 
consideration concrete initiatives that were put forward by the 
American side in the course of Prime Minister Kontic's visit to 
New York. 
  The federal government today examined and endorsed a report 
on Yugoslav-U.S. relations under the conditions of crisis on the 
territory of former SFRY and the U.S. policy toward the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia. In this regard, the importance of 
normalization of bilateral relations with the United States was 
emphasized, which was assessed as an important precondition for 
the just resolution of the Yugoslav crisis, the lifting of the 
UN Security Council sanctions and reintegration of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia in the international community. 
  A report on issues relating to cooperation with the 
Hague-based International War Crimes Tribunal, which is to try 
war crime- perpetrators from the former SFRY, and with a UN 
expert commission that was founded to investigate war crimes, 
was endorsed. In this connection the federal government 
concluded that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had a firm 
standpoint as regards prosecuting and punishing all persons who 
have committed crimes and have violated international 
humanitarian law. All such crimes are also punishable by the 
laws of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and therefore our 
judicial bodies are duty-bound to examine all relevant documents 
charging citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and 
persons staying on its territory, and if found guilty prosecute 
and punish them. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia also 
accepts cooperation with all UN bodies, on this equal basis, not 
on the discriminatory basis on which the tribunal was founded, 
it was concluded at the session. 
  A platform for official visits by Yugoslav Foreign Minister 
Vladislav Jovanovic to Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Benin, and Gabon 
by the end of the month has been adopted. Guidelines have also 
been adopted for the participation of a Yugoslav delegation at a 
festival devoted to Nikola Tesla, which is to be held in 
Timisoara, Romania on 11 and 12 March. 
  The federal government set 20 March as the new deadline for 
the completion of final financial reports for last year. 
  Asim Telacevic has been relieved of his duties as federal 
deputy prime minister, because he is taking up a new post. 
Prime Minister Kontic appointed Uros Klikovac, hitherto the 
chairman of the committee for justice and federal administration 
of the Federal Assembly's Chamber of Republics, as the new 
federal deputy prime minister. 
  Vasilije Medenica, hitherto an official in the Federal 
Ministry of Transport and Communications, has been appointed 
acting federal flights inspector.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ljubodrag Stojadinovic: "Tuzla More Dangerous </F>
Than Sarajevo"] 
  [Text] "Good night, Sarajevo, good morning, Tuzla." This 
is the title of a large article published in a newspaper of a 
Western country that is known for its efforts to end the war in 
Bosnia with "legitimate violence." This title is reminiscent of 
the Sarajevo Olympics slogan ("It was nice in Sarajevo, see you 
in Calgary!"). The message of this headline is a symbolic 
transposition of a successful model since everybody is convinced 
now that the Sarajevo model is the achievement of his life. All 
the participants in the Sarajevo action think that they scored 
diplomatic and other victories, which is a very sincere opinion. 
  The atmosphere created by the feelings of victory is to a 
certain extent a logical consequence of the high tension caused 
by the threat of a general war, which would have been a defeat 
for most of the participants and observers of the Sarajevo 
tragedy. All this contributed to the unfolding of events in a 
way that was inconceivable only 10 days ago. The winners are 
the Serbs, the Muslims, NATO, Russia, the tortured inhabitants 
of Sarajevo, the prophets who predicted the end of modern 
coalition monsters, and the cautious. The euphoria was 
expressed in different ways. The most influential were the most 
successful in convincing world audiences that the solution to 
the Sarajevo drama was a historic victory of the suspicious 
institution of ultimatum. After the euphoria had died down, it 
was seen that the story about "the Sarajevo model" was a 
complicated matter, and that this model is applicable only if 
the stones are put very carefully together, and this only once. 
The transfer of experiences is possible, but the transfer of 
the whole operation is, however, impossible. It must be 
realized that there is no universality in a recipe that may have 
been successful in one case. 
  It does not seem that the West is quite convinced that 
everything functioned according to the law of cruel war 
blackmail. In spite of this, the Alliance wants to try out its 
concept -- which consists of threatening force and of creating 
good reasons to avoid its use in the end -- on other Bosnian 
towns. The phenomenon of revenge against one warring faction 
dominated in Sarajevo, but the aim in Tuzla is quite different, 
although it might also include revenge. It is claimed that Tuzla 
airport is the key to the control of events in the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, but this may be only partially true. 
Closer to the truth might be the formula that there is a 
combination of direct interests and exertion of pressure through 
escalation, a combination in which every move follows from the 
previous one. Apart from the ultimatum (which is in a certain 
sense already set), in the case of Tuzla there is also the 
element of real provocation directed toward Serbia and the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This has not been confirmed in 
public (yet), but nor has it been denied. 
  Tuzla airport is more important closed than open. If it is 
open, there is no great and dangerous theatrical performance 
around it -- which must have the dimensions of a exciting war 
story in order to be of interest to the audiences and to result 
in expected reactions. If the Serbs do not yield to the 
blackmail, the airport will be opened by force. Many analysts 
think that such a move (legitimate violence) would have 
considerably more serious consequences than the hypothetical 
chase after Serbian guns around Sarajevo. The deadline set by 
NATO for the opening of Tuzla airport is 7 March. This is proof 
that there is a difference in the procedure between Sarajevo and 
Tuzla. In case of Sarajevo Butrus-Ghali asked NATO to prepare a 
bombing action. In case of Tuzla, however, NATO asked 
Butrus-Ghali to act and took on the privilege for itself to 
support the action from the air. Basically, NATO dictated the 
rules of the game in both cases, though without having two basic 
pieces of information. First of all, whether its dictate was at 
all accepted, and second, how it would behave if its offer to 
support the action from the air was flatly refused. The 
Sarajevo action was explained with a series of humanitarian 
reasons and with the destiny of approximately 200,000 people, 
while the "Tuzla operation" on the other hand is explained with 
the necessity of having an airport, without mentioning that 
there are people in Tuzla, too -- just as in Sarajevo. In this 
case predominantly Serbs. 
  Careful observers of the events in Bosnia are afraid of the 
future, of the announced spring offensives and of the 
restoration of the unnatural love between the Croats and the 
Muslims. The announced NATO violence against the Serbs in 
eastern Bosnia, supplies of weapons to the Muslims, and the 
increased presence of the West on the Drina River would have 
give a unique sense of threat to all Serbs. For this reason 
Tuzla is a critical point for the war caravan in the Balkans. 
Will everything be stopped at the last minute? Is it enough to 
rely on energetic diplomatic help from Russia? An ultimatum is 
not allowed as a means of exerting pressure, but it is 
convincingly dangerous because it functions in this way, since 
it is always possible to use force in the end. 
  Not only the Serbs, but the whole world will some day be 
confronted with the dilemma as to what point agreements cannot 
be made any more, and when methods of humiliation should be 
used. Sarajevo became history a long time ago. Tuzla might be 
the town of the biggest drama, and it is important that 
everybody knows what he has to do until the climax is reached. 
[sentence as published] The night between 20 and 21 February was 
declared the night of general victory, and this may be the best 
sign that no new deadlines should be set, because there is 
always enough time for defeats. There have been a few wars that 
ended through an ultimatum, but some of the biggest started 
exactly in this way.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Legalization of Revised Yalta"] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade -- Yesterday's Croatian-Muslim agreement, 
backed by the United States and the powerful Western states, 
presents in its essence the division of the former Yugoslavia 
into the Western and Russian sphere of interests. That 
agreement, if it succeeds, will represent an international 
legalization of a somewhat revised oral agreement reached half a 
century ago in Yalta among Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill. 
This is said in the statement by the Serbian Renewal Movement 
[SPO] Presidency. 
  Slovenia, Croatia, and about half the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be under the political and economic 
patronage of the most developed countries in the world, while 
Serbia, Montenegro, and the Srpska republic will be in the 
sphere of the political influence of Russia. It will be a region 
that will not be in the position to count on the economic and 
technological support by the West for a long time, the SPO says. 
  As for the republic of Serbian Krajina, its fate will be 
decided through negotiations between Zagreb, which is becoming 
increasingly strong economically, and Knin, which on the other 
hand is economically weakening. 
  The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will most likely 
find itself with Greece and Albania under the political and 
economic influence of the West, the SPO Presidency says.

<F P=106> [Article by Dragoslav Rancic: "The Return of the Russians"] </F>
  [Text] As is usually the case in most dramatic situations, 
the tragedy was avoided at the last moment. The Russians asked 
the Serbs to withdraw their artillery from around Sarajevo; the 
Serbs fulfilled the Russians' wish, while pretending at the same 
time not to have accepted the NATO ultimatum; the UN 
representative declared that the warring factions had fulfilled 
all the requirements and the strategists in Aviano called off 
the bombing flights. In the meantime, the Russians, in "blue 
helmets," arrived in Grbavica, defused the time bomb, and left 
NATO "swimming in an empty pool," thus asserting in grand style 
their return not only to the Balkans, but also to the 
international scene. 
  Moscow celebrated this action as its great diplomatic 
victory. Yeltsin's headquarters made it known that not a single 
shot had been fired, not a single life had been threatened, and 
not a single kopeck had been spent. Russia had regained its 
historical role in the Balkans and had showed the scope of its 
influence in Europe and in the world. 
  Surprised and to some extent offended, the Americans 
officially thanked the Russians for their skilled action. 
However, there prevailed the view in the United States that 
Russia had suddenly changed the Sarajevo scenario on its own. 
It was claimed that Russia had sent its UN troops to Sarajevo 
without informing the United States, that it had reached an 
agreement with the Bosnian Serbs in order to satisfy its 
nationalists, that it had helped the Serbs to preserve their 
honor, thus presenting the United States with an accomplished 
fact. 
  All other opinions and assessments lie between these two 
standpoints. One hears the view that Russia has not only saved 
the honor of the Serbs but also that of the Americans and NATO, 
and even its own, since, for a long time, it has given in to the 
West over the Yugoslav crisis. According to the opinion of 
some, they had offered their support to the Serbs, while, 
according to others, they had forced them to accept the 
ultimatum by using persuasion instead of threats. 
  In Pale, where Russian soldiers were welcomed with bread and 
salt, the Moscow move was interpreted as a guarantee that the 
Serbian population around Sarajevo would be protected and that 
there would not be a change in the strategic balance on the 
battlefields after the heavy weapons have been withdrawn. 
Russia had also brought the necessary balance into the peace 
process and had reestablished the confidence of the Bosnian 
Serbs in the UN and the international community in general. The 
view was also expressed that future relations between Russia and 
the United States might be defined in Bosnia. 
  There is no doubt that Russia succeeded in reducing the 
pressure that had built up all over the world as the deadline 
for the ultimatum drew near. Russia opposed the ultimatum and 
announced a great diplomatic initiative aimed at securing 
permanent peace in Bosnia. Taking into account that Russia has 
not formulated its own concept for resolving the Bosnian crisis 
since the outbreak of the civil war two years ago and that it 
has only followed the proposals of the Geneva peace conference 
and the UN Security Council, the announcement of a diplomatic 
initiative is already a sign that Russia is ready to participate 
actively in the peace process in former Yugoslavia. It is 
immaterial whether this more active role on the part of Russia 
is a consequence of internal pressure or stems from the view 
that ultimatums must not become a normal solution to complex 
international problems. 
  The initial reactions indicate that Russia has showed that 
it 
has the status of a super power again, at least in the Balkans. 
In addition, it is stated that Russia has always been powerful 
when it has been a force in the Balkans. 
  The Russians have shown the West, primarily the Americans, 
that they will not accept the status of an unequal or simply 
obedient partner and that their cooperative attitude has perhaps 
been interpreted in the wrong way. They does not want their 
good relations with the West, primarily with the United States, 
to deteriorate, but they indicate that disagreements could serve 
as a warning to both countries that the balance in international 
relations must be reestablished, especially between "influential 
partners," as this is euphemistically expressed by Russian 
diplomacy. 
  It seems that the new Russian initiative, which was 
announced 
by Kozyrev, and which was probably discussed during the meeting 
in Bonn, is a part of Yeltsin's proposal to discuss the future 
of Bosnia at a summit involving the "big five": the United 
States, Great Britain, France, Germany, and Russia. Most of 
these countries are permanent members of the UN Security 
Council; China's place was offered to Germany as the most 
influential country in the European Union. 
  At the same time, Russia has announced that the European or 
the U.S. peace proposals for Bosnia are not the only ones that 
exist. Russia, for example, does not think that "the Sarajevo 
model" can be applied easily to other towns, which seems to be a 
broadly accepted attitude in the West. Not only because they 
oppose a series of ultimatums, but also for practical reasons: 
The additional massing of UN peacekeeping forces is very 
expensive. 
  Regardless of how the return of the Russians to the Balkans 
might be assessed, it is true that they have taken away the war 
toy from NATO strategists and obliged international diplomacy to 
reconsider all options, except for the bombing one. It can 
hardly be imagined that bombs could fall on Serbian positions 
around Sarajevo if Russian "blue helmets" are stationed there. 
Decisions about possible new ultimatums will also not be passed 
that easily. 
  It is not clear what will happen on the diplomatic scene. 
Will the UN, which has so far been dominated by the United 
States, realize that its reputation has been enhanced with the 
help of the Russians, as UN officials claim? What is the role 
of the Geneva peace conference in the context of the Russian 
proposal to hold a "big five" summit, given that Owen and 
Stoltenberg did not participate in the Bonn meeting? 
  The Russian action and their return to the Balkans will be 
discussed for a long time, but a difference will be made between 
tactics and strategy, once the surprise and euphoria have 
subsided. 
  Two very important components -- the economic and the 
military -- are still missing for a real return of Russian 
influence to this part of the Balkans. The scope of the first 
cannot be established on account of the transformation process 
in Russia, on the one hand, and the blockade of Yugoslavia, on 
the other. The military component, if "blue helmets" are 
excluded, is simply inconceivable. This means that, apart from 
romanticism and tradition, there is only diplomatic and 
political influence: The Russians have a dialogue with the 
Serbs based on mutual trust, which no other international power 
has. The United States and most Western countries are ignoring 
Serbia as a necessary element in the search for a solution to 
the Bosnian and Yugoslav crisis in general. 
  The most important question now is to what extent will 
Russia, with permission from the West, develop into a strong 
diplomatic mediator, that is to say, into an influential power.

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 3 Mar (TANJUG) -- The Democratic Party 
[DP] will not take part in the new republican government which 
Mirko Marjanovic is to form, Democratic Party Chairman Zoran 
Djindjic said today in TANJUG's guest interview. 
  "We will not enter the government because we believe that 
conditions for that are not ripe," Djindjic explained. He said 
that the Democratic Party's attitude to the government would be 
one of good will and that its vote would depend on the program 
presented by the prime minister-designate. 
  "It is not ruled out that we might vote for the government, 
and it is not ruled out either that we might abstain, but it is 
unlikely that we will vote against the government," Djindjic 
noted. 
  The Democratic Party leader noted that the idea of a 
government of national unity, advocated by his party, has been 
abandoned. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A Serbian commission in Kosova today threatened the 
authorities of the Prishtina Albanological Institute to evacuate 
the building or else they would violently intervene. Concerning 
this event, here is a telephone report by Shaqir Funiqi: 
  [Funiqi] The legitimate leaders of the Albanian science and 
research institute said that only physical violence -- the only 
means of this regime in Kosova -- could make them leave their 
building. After an hour and a half talk, the uninvited 
emissaries went away, but they left behind the definitive threat 
that they plan to execute this decision tomorrow. 
  Meanwhile, it is reported that, as a sign of protest against 
this invidious and uncivilized act, Professor Dr. Zekeria Cana 
is remaining in the institution. 
  The less culture you have, the less culture you need -- by 
promoting this idea, the Serb violence in Kosova is arbitrarily 
extinguishing the last oasis of Albanian thinking and scientific 
activity -- the Albanological Institute. The wicked Serbian 
campaign against Albanian culture, which is now being nailed 
like the Prometheus and is being placed in a grip, is taking on 
destructive dimensions with a clear postulation -- to also 
conduct the Serbianization of Kosova in the field of culture. 
  The Albanological Institute, as a model institution of 
science and knowledge, will certainly survive the violence and 
will manage to promote the Albanian competent scientific 
thinking.

  [Text] Paris, March 3 (AFP) -- Visiting Croatian Foreign 
Minister Mate Granic called on Bosnia-Herzegovina's Serbs 
Thursday to join the negotiations between the ex-Yugoslav 
republic's Moslems and Croats on forming a federation. 
  "We share France's view that an agreement must be reached 
with the Serbs," Granic said after a meeting with French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe. Croats will suggest "the Serbs join this 
federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina on the same conditions which 
have been accepted by the other two parties (Croats and 
Moslems), and the negotiations which are going to start" in the 
wake of the federation agreement signed Tuesday in Washington. 
  However Croatia would seek "the support of France and the 
European Union to get back" land captured by Serbs in Croatia, 
he said. "Of course we want to normalize relations with 
Belgrade, but this can only be done with reintegration, through 
peaceful means, of (Serb-) occupied territories in Croatia, as 
is provided for in the plan signed in Washington." 
  Granic also said he "agreed the humanitarian situation 
should 
improve as quickly as possible" in Bosnia. Humanitarian convoys 
must be allowed to travel unhindered through central Bosnia and 
"all prisoners" of war should be freed. 
  Juppe for his part said France believed "there could be no 
stable settlement unless the Serb community were associated" 
with the federation agreement. He stressed the "situation on 
the ground must improve" and noted the "air network" set up by 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United Nations to 
discourage renewed hostilities remained "in effect." 
  Juppe said a "global settlement" of the almost two-year-old 
Bosnian conflict meant "active participation by the Americans, 
Russians, and Europeans" and that the European Union "will 
participate in the region's reconstruction" once peace has 
returned.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The radio ship broadcasting 
off the coast of Yugoslavia, known as Radio Brod, went off the 
air on Tuesday at midnight. The station had been broadcasting 
to all of the former Yugoslavia since April of last year. The 
European Union, which had been backing the project, said it 
could no longer provide financial support because of an 
administrative reorganization. The journalists from throughout 
the former Yugoslavia who were involved in the project are 
understandably furious. At a press conference on Tuesday they 
said the weren't given any warning about the move and therefore 
couldn't look for alternative financing. 
  The journalists have asked Italy for authorization to set up 
a transmitter off the Italian coast. Italy, they say, is their 
last hope because the republics of the former Yugoslavia have 
all refused to allow them to erect a transmitter and the 
Albanian government hasn't responded. [passage omitted] 
  The ship is now sailing to Marseille in the south of France 
and the 19 journalists on board all plan to return home -- 
except for the three Bosnians, who have no home to return to.

Unemployment in January: Alarming Growth Rate--Employment 
Offices Register 69,527 More Jobless in January--Forecasts Warn 
of 3.05 Million Unemployed by End of 1994--Money for Benefits 
Available So Far"] 
  [Text] This time, there is no reason to feel optimistic. 
To date, we have 2,959,100 registered unemployed. This means 
that, in January, employment offices registered in excess of 
69,500 unemployed people more than during the previous month. 
Is it a seasonal phenomenon? According to Jerzy Szreter, labor 
and social policy vice minister, it is difficult to formulate an 
unequivocal hypothesis on the basis of the data available to us 
at the moment. 
  The increase in the number of unemployed was registered in 
virtually every voivodship in the country, with the highest 
increment in Chelm (6.3 percent) and Krakow (5.3 percent) 
Voivodships. 
  Things were bad enough before, but they are getting even 
worse now. The proportion of unemployed women is on the 
increase (51.6 percent), as is that of people who are not 
eligible for unemployment benefits. Of the newly registered 
unemployed, more than 64,500 are not entitled to receive 
unemployment benefits (compared with 48,500 in December). This 
is still the largest group among the total population of 
registered unemployed. 
  The only optimistic accent in this situation is that there 
are a few more job vacancies on the labor market (in January 
there were 41,171 vacancies, compared to 28,000 in December). 
At the same time, there is still a tremendous differentiation 
in this index between different regions of the country. For 
example, the largest number of unemployed per job vacancy was 
recorded in the following voivodships: Ostroleka (953), Biala 
Podlaska (914), and Kielce (814). The best situation in the 
local labor market was reported in Warsaw (16 applicants per 
vacancy), Gdansk (37 applicants per vacancy), and Krakow 
Voivodships. 
  More than 53,000 jobless were employed in various emergency 
operations and more than 15,600 in a range of public works. In 
addition, more than 13,600 people were being trained or 
retrained for new jobs. 
  Close observation of the changes that took place in the 
labor 
market last year could lead us to expect that a further increase 
in unemployment figures is again possible in February, while 
March should see a stemming of the tide, and April should bring 
a stop to the seasonal surge in unemployment. However, all of 
these estimates are still based on speculation. 
  The official announcement of a proposed introduction of a 
number of new legislative moves brought further confusion into 
the scene. For example, the announcement that the period of 
eligibility for unemployment benefits will be extended for 
people with dependent children in full-time education. A surge 
in unemployment registrations for a certain social 
group--namely, sole family breadwinners--has already been noted 
in employment offices in Lodz. 
  What are the needs of the national labor market? To begin 
with, several hundred billion zlotys [Z] for regions under 
particular threat of unemployment, Z800 billion to finance 
restructuring projects for the regions of Lodz and Walbrzych, 
and Z2 trillion for intensification of projects promoting active 
forms of combating unemployment. 
  "There is enough money in the kitty for unemployment 
benefits now, and there will be enough for the future," Minister 
Szreter assures us. "There is no direct danger that we will run 
out of funds. Even so, should the situation on the labor market 
continue to deteriorate sharply and result in an unexpectedly 
large increase in unemployment figures, we will have one other 
solution left: simply to curtail expenditure on schemes 
promoting active forms of combating unemployment (we are not, in 
any case, statutorily obliged to run them)." 
  For the time being, the ministry has no available data that 
would enable experts to establish whether privatization causes 
increased unemployment. On the one hand, privatization 
certainly promotes rationalization of employment, and that means 
reduction in the numbers of work positions. On the other hand, 
it often poses a dilemma: Should the employer choose to salvage 
at least half of the existing work positions through 
privatization, or should he let them all go, thus throwing all 
employees out onto the streets? 
  There are more mass layoffs in the state sector, although 
the 
time when the private sector forever employed new people and 
never laid them off is long gone. It is true that many new firms 
are being created all the time, but just as many are 
simultaneously collapsing and going bankrupt. 
  Unfortunately, all attempts to press Minister Szreter to 
reveal whether the forecasts claiming that by the end of this 
year we would have, at most, 3.05 million unemployed were at all 
realistic, met with no success. He failed to answer the 
question clearly and unequivocally; indeed, he could not have 
done so because no one can know the answer. All too frequently, 
unemployment has made it plain that it is an elementary force 
that can easily defeat all attempts to control it....

  [Text] Prague March 3 (CTK) -- The majority of delegations 
at the 25th session of the Committee of Senior Officials of the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe [CSCE] being 
held here see a positive turn in the developments surrounding 
the conflict in Bosnia, head of the Czech delegation and 
director of the Foreign Ministry's Security Policy Department 
Pavel Vacek told CTK today. 
  He added that a decisive approach by NATO would play a 
positive role. With the ending of the blockades of Sarajevo and 
the Washington agreement between the Bosnian Croatians and 
Muslims the tone was more hopeful, and this had created a wider 
background for consideration of what the CSCE could do to solve 
the Yugoslav problem. 
  Part of the main stream of activity should include the 
renewal of long-term missions to Kosovo, Vojvodina and Sandzak. 
Vacek said that the Belgrade authorities could, in exchange for 
making compromises in this direction, expect certain concessions 
from the CSCE, above all the reacceptance of Serbian-Montenegrin 
Yugoslavia as a member. 
  The question of Macedonia's request for full participative 
status in the CSCE had not yet been dealt with, Vacek said. The 
question was being blocked by Greece and Albania, he said, 
adding that it could not be ruled out that Albania would no 
longer oppose the request, but Greece continued to disagree with 
it. However, Vacek said it was positive that Macedonia's 
request had not been withdrawn from the agenda of the council, 
whose session has been running since Wednesday [2 March]. 
  An extensive debate had been held on Georgia, with the 
questions continuing to be debated of how the CSCE should 
broaden its activity in South Osetia, and how the CSCE could 
contribute to the achievement of political balance in the area. 
This depended on the solution of the conflict in Abkhazia, 
generally considered as a more complicated part of the Georgian 
crisis. Vacek pointed out that here there existed a fundamental 
division of the work and responsibility of the UN and the CSCE. 
One of the results of the present session of the Committee of 
Senior Officials in Prague could be a decision on the joint 
activity of the two institutions, he said.

  [Text] Prague, March 1 (CTK) -- In a survey of 16 Central 
and Eastern European countries conducted by the Commission of 
the European Union and published today, the Czech Republic 
emerges as the country with the most popular support for the 
tempo of its reforms. 
  In terms of overall satisfaction with a market economy, 
however, 71 percent of Albanian citizens expressed their 
approval, the highest result in the survey. With the growth of 
the economy in that country the financial situation of Albanian 
households has also been improving. 
  Czechs were somewhat more restrained in their praise of 
capitalist economies, with 51 percent signifying approval and 36 
percent disapproval. In Slovakia the majority in the survey 
were displeased with market economy (44 percent disapproval, 40 
percent approval). 
  Market economy was rejected by an absolute majority of 
polled 
citizens from the Commonwealth of the Independent States, but 
overall the survey found that its support was eroding in other 
countries as well. Survey results connected the current 
economic difficulties in the countries with the drop off in 
support. 
  A total of 50 percent of Czech Republic's citizens approved 
of the pace of reform, the most of all countries surveyed. 
Twenty-one percent considered the reform process to be too slow 
and 18 percent too quick. In all other countries the dominant 
opinion was that reform was proceeding too slowly. 
  Citizens of the Czech Republic also approved the most often 
in the survey of the pace of privatization, which 39 percent 
considered to be optimal. It was too slow for 36 percent and 
too fast for 14 percent of Czech citizens. In Poland and 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], 
however, a majority of citizens considered the progress of 
privatization to be too quick, while in other countries a 
majority saw privatization as proceeding too slowly. 
  The greatest dissatisfaction with the tempo of privatization 
was observed in Slovakia where 54 percent said it was too slow, 
and in Ukraine where 59 percent were dissatisfied with the pace 
of privatization.

  [Text] Tirana, March 4 (ATA) -- The chairman of the 
Democratic Party of Albania, Mr. Eduard Selami, received on 
March 3 the chairman of the Party for Democratic Prosperity 
[PDP] of the Albanians in FYROM [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia], Mr. Arben Xhaferri. Mr. Xhaferri said that the 
position of the Party for Democratic Prosperity is in favour of 
the request to conser [as received] Albanians in FYROM as a 
constituent people, who should be represented in the Macedonian 
Parliament. 
  The chairman of the Democratic Party, Mr. Eduard Selami said 
that the rights of the Albanians in Macedonia should be 
respected and they should be represented in a proportional way 
in the structures of the Macedonian state. "We have supported 
and we support peace and stability in FYROM because we consider 
them important for the situation in the region," stressed Mr. 
Selami, adding that peace and stability in this republic are 
closely connected with the respect of the rights of Albanians 
there.

  [Text] Warsaw, Mar. 2 -- According to Tadeusz Mazowiecki, 
the Serb announced opening of the airport in Tuzla "is very 
important to the region." Mazowiecki has insisted on the 
importance of this event for quite some time in his reports. 
The opening of the airport defended by the Muslims in Tuzla in 
Bosnia was announced by Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian 
Serbs in Moscow on Tuesday. 
  Mazowiecki, special rapporteur of the UN human rights 
commission on the observance of human rights in the former 
Yugoslavia, returned to Warsaw from Geneva on Wednesday, where 
he had presented his report on Monday. 
  The conflict entered a new phase from the moment that the 
heavy divisions left Sarajevo in result of the pressure exerted 
by the UN secretary general and NATO, emphasized Mazowiecki, 
adding that for the first time the international community has 
put its words into action. "This is why we can hope that peace 
in this region is possible," he concluded.

<F P=106> ["Prime Minister Lyuben Berov: Passage of 1994 Budget Is </F>
Vote of Confidence in Cabinet" -- BTA headline] 
  [Text] Sofia, March 1 (BTA) -- The cabinet sees the 
passage of the 1994 National Budget Bill as a vote of confidence 
in the policy it is pursuing, Prime Minister Berov said today 
speaking to representatives of the national mass media. He also 
said that this vote of confidence gives an occasion to consider 
the major goals the sitting cabinet has set for itself for 1994. 
  The prime minister told journalists that the passage of the 
budget will set in action a system of measures aimed at taking 
this country out of its financial isolation through settling the 
problems pertaining to the finalization of the agreement in 
principle on Bulgaria's foreign debt and through attracting 
foreign investments. 
  Prof. Berov stressed that the cabinet-sponsored programme of 
December 1992 continues to be effective. This was the programme 
with which the government came out in December 1992 when it was 
formed on the mandate of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms and the support of the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
and the New Union for Democracy (set up by defectors and 
expellees of the anti-Communist Union of the Democratic Forces, 
SDS). 
  Prof. Berov said the cabinet will concentrate its efforts on 
optimizing the management and privatization of state-owned 
property. Forty percent of the capital of the functioning 
state-owned companies will be denationalized after parliament 
adopts the mass privatization programme, the prime minister 
said. He went on to say that the cabinet is developing a system 
of measures designed to promote the private initiative in the 
production sector, as well as a variety of other measures aimed 
at the social policy in the period of structural adjustments. 
One of the major goals of the Cabinet will be to bring the 
inflation rate further down from 64 percent in 1993 to 35-45 
percent in 1994, Prime Minister Berov said. 
  Prof. Berov dismissed as groundless "the statements made by 
some of our (the Cabinet's) adversaries alleging that the land 
reform is likely to stop across the country, that some of the 
major restitution acts will be repealed, that certain members 
and supporters of the SDS will be persecuted, etc." The prime 
minister described these allegations as publicity stunt and said 
the threats for reinstating of the former nomenklatura to top 
government offices, restoration of the Soviet-style cooperative 
farms, plots against the private business, a new orientation of 
this country's foreign policy and an attack against the 
judiciary, all these come in vain. 
  The prime minister in mid-January called upon the MP's to 
pass the 1994 national budget bill within mid-February. The 
budget was passed yesterday [28 February], according to him much 
later than the deadline he had set, on the votes of the 
pro-cabinet parliamentary majority.

  [Text] Sofia, March 2 (BTA) -- Bulgarian Minister of 
Justice Petur Kornazhev expressed his satisfaction with his 
three-day formal visit to Greece paid at the invitation of Greek 
Minister of Justice Yeoryios Skouvelakis. 
  PASOK's [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] Cabinet stands 
firmly in favour of closer contacts with Bulgaria, Mr. Kornazhev 
told a BTA reporter upon his return to Bulgaria. He also said 
that Greece is expecting a visit by Bulgarian Prime Minister 
Lyuben Berov in a two week's time. 
  Mr. Kornazhev told this reporter that he and his host 
identified a common understanding on the judicial problems of 
the European Union. The two discussed a variety of issues, 
including the conditions in Bulgarian and Greek jails, problems 
pertaining to the execution of death penalty and the specificity 
of the Balkans. 
  Mr. Kornazhev and Mr. Skouvelakis reportedly considered a 
bilateral agreement on transfer of convicts which has to be 
further deliberated before being signed. 
  Speaking with his Greek hosts, Mr. Kornazhev stressed that 
Bulgaria is supportive of a policy of active neutrality in the 
Balkans and that it sees no controversial issues concerning its 
borders with Greece. The Bulgarian minister of justice said he 
also met Greek Interior Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos.

  [Text] Sofia, March 2 (BTA) - In 1993, Bulgaria's imports 
exceeded exports by U.S.$53 million, Stefan Uzunov, head of the 
Trade Analyses Department at the Institute of Trade, is quoted 
as saying in 24 CHASA. Imports increased by 15.7 percent last 
year, reaching $3,707 million, while exports grew by as little 
as 5.4 percent to U.S.$3,654 million. In 1993 Bulgaria's 
commercial exchanges rose by 10.3 percent, reaching U.S.$7,362 
million, Institute of Trade research shows. 
  The steepest decline of 30 percent from 1992 affected 
Bulgarian exports to the Arab world. Exports to EFTA [European 
Free Trade Association] countries fell by 9.5 percent, and those 
to Central and Eastern Europe by 5.4 percent from 1992. 
  Goods worth about U.S.$1,500 million, delivered to Bulgaria 
from Central and Eastern Europe, accounted for 40.1 percent of 
total imports. Deliveries from the EU, worth U.S.$1,167 
million, contributed 31.5 percent to total imports. 
  Last year Bulgaria trade was most imbalanced with Central 
and 
Eastern Europe ($217 million deficit), the EU ($169.1 million) 
and the EFTA countries (U.S.$93.8 million). 
  The CIS is still Bulgaria's main market, in spite of the 
sharp fall of Bulgarian exports to it. To Russia alone, 
Bulgaria shipped goods worth U.S.$408.4 million. High tariffs 
and taxes as well as the lack of interbank links are the major 
obstacles to trade with East European countries, Ivan Kolev, 
head of the Transition Economies Department of the Ministry of 
Trade, believes.

  [Text] Skopje March 3 (CTK) -- With the exchange of notes 
between the Foreign Ministries here today the mutual recognition 
and establishment of diplomatic relations between the Czech 
Republic and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM], the former Yugoslav federation republic, 
was formally endorsed. 
  The Czech Government already officially recognised Macedonia 
and announced its intention to set up diplomatic relations on 
ambassadorial level on March 2. In fact, the Czech Republic has 
practically recognised Macedonia by voting for its acceptance 
into the United Nations. 
  The note was extended to the Macedonian side today by 
Director of the Czech Foreign Ministry Euro-Atlantic Division 
Ivan Busniak. He also handed his Macedonian colleagues a 
message from Czech President Vaclav Havel, Premier Vaclav Klaus 
and Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec. 
  Macedonia won independence two years ago after the breakup 
of 
the former Yugoslavia. It was practically the only Yugoslav 
republic which gained independence in a peaceful way. The 
position of Greece, which objects to the use by Macedonia of the 
name "Macedonia" and the state symbols which are considered by 
Greeks as their historical heritage prevents more rapid 
international recognition of Macedonia. 
  "Given that the Czech Republic has resorted to this step 
under a certain concrete situation existing in the Balkans and 
especially in the southern part of the region, its decision to 
establish diplomatic relations with Macedonia is a recognition 
of the balanced, sober and realistic politics of the current 
Macedonian leadership," Busniak said. 
  At the same time, he noted that the decision was not taking 
sides in the dispute between Macedonia and Greece, which has 
been going on for over two years. That is why the Czech 
Republic recognised Macedonia as the "former Yugoslav republic" 
and at the same time the Czech Government stated that it 
recognised Macedonia in its current borders. 
  It is impossible to expect opening of embassies in Prague 
and 
Skopje in the near future primarily due to economic reasons, he 
said. 
  "We are really greatly interested in opening an embassy in 
Prague. However we are building our diplomatic service 
practically from scratch and we have neither sufficient 
financial means nor necessary cadres," Macedonian Foreign 
Minister Stevo Crvenkovski said, adding that his country was 
able to open 25 representative offices abroad at the most.

  [Text] Prague, March 1 (CTK) -- "I think NATO felt the 
need to show firmness," Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus said in an 
interview broadcast by Czech Radio on Tuesday concerning 
Monday's shooting down by NATO of four Serbian planes. 
  Klaus stressed that until this morning it was not clear 
which 
planes had been involved. "We know well that in this strange war 
many strange things are done by individuals which are not 
entirely synchronized and coordinated with the others," he said. 
  In Bosnia there were now various "subcommanders who have the 
power to send out four planes somewhere," Klaus said. 
"Therefore I think I am right in saying that not even the NATO 
commander was clear -- he said so this morning -- as to where 
the planes left from and why they were going somewhere," Klaus 
said, adding that "something happened, and it is unnecessary to 
speculate about what it will lead to."

  [Text] Prague, March 3 (CTK) -- In reaction to the 
Slovak-introduced import surcharge the Czech Republic will this 
afternoon devalue the Czech crown by three percent within the 
clearing ECU [European Currency Unit] which is used in payments 
between the two countries, Premier Vaclav Klaus has announced. 
  Speaking after an emergency meeting of economic ministers, 
Klaus said the Czech Republic expected the 10 percent surcharge 
introduced as from Thursday to be in force only until July 1. 
  Klaus said that with the devaluation of the Czech crown by 
three percent within the clearing ECU, the Czech crown would 
return to the level existing before February 8, 1993, when new 
payment relations with Slovakia were introduced. 
  He said the Czech side was disappointed that it had not been 
sufficiently informed of the Slovak measure beforehand, at least 
on the level of premiers or finance ministers, adding that he 
had only verbal information about the Slovak step. 
  On the information available so far, the Czech side believes 
the Slovak import surcharge is to last only until July 1, Klaus 
said. Cabinet ministers believe that the newly introduced import 
surcharge is identical to that existing in the latest stage in 
the former Czechoslovakia. "The 10-percent import surcharge is 
applicable primarily to goods designated for final consumption," 
Klaus said. 
  The Czech cabinet believes that the introduction of the 
import surcharge de facto means "half-devaluation" of the Slovak 
crown. "Devaluation concerns imports but not Slovak exports," 
Klaus said. He said the Czech side considered the Slovak step to 
be fully legitimate and as an economic measure more acceptable 
than the recent administrative measure by the Slovak Government 
which complicated exports of Czech foodstuffs to Slovakia. 
  He said the Czech cabinet did not expect any general or 
significant negative impact on the Czech economy due to the 
Slovak measure. "It will rather have an impact on individual 
regions, economic sectors and especially on individual firms," 
Klaus said, adding that for some Czech exporters it might mean a 
temporary halt in exports or decrease in profits. 
  In view of the import surcharge, the Czech side intends to 
ask Slovak authorities to abolish different administrative 
measures which, Klaus said, have started to penetrate the 
Czech-Slovak trade. He mentioned the measures recently 
introduced by the Slovak customs which hampered exports of Czech 
foodstuffs to Slovakia. 
  Klaus said the Czech Government would announce its readiness 
to discuss the abolition of the old bloc of the clearing account 
which is used for payments between the two countries for deals 
carried out before February 8, 1993. He said the finance 
minister will submit a material proposing the abolition of this 
account to the government. The Slovak Government has approved a 
similar material some time ago.

  [Text] Prague March 2 (CTK) -- The Czech Government is 
watching with "certain apprehension" Austria's steps concerning 
the completion of the Temelin nuclear power plant in South 
Bohemia, Premier Vaclav Klaus said Wednesday [2 March] after a 
cabinet meeting. 
  He said the Austrian ambassador to the United States on 
Tuesday [1 March] again visited the EXIM bank president and sent 
a letter to several senators and congressmen containing a 
500-page supplement in different languages. 
  On January 27, the EXIM bank agreed to provide a guarantee 
for a loan to the Westinghouse firm worth 317 million dollars to 
complete Temelin. The U.S. Congress had 35 days to express its 
opinion on the project and the deadline will expire on March 3. 
The bank could theoretically step down from the project if a 
sufficiently large number of congressmen exert strong pressure 
on it. 
  Klaus said the Czech Government was "watching attentively" 
further actions by the Austrian officials in this matter. He 
said so far the Czech Republic has been successful in rejecting 
Austrians' "unfounded allegations." "The government is quite 
sure that the guarantee question will be positively settled at a 
congress meeting on March 10," Klaus said. 
  He said the acceptance of Austria into the European Union 
(EU) would not lend strength to Austrian opposition against 
Temelin. "I would not see any connection in it since Austria is 
one of the few EU members that are not inclined towards nuclear 
power," Klaus said. 
  The Czech Government did not see the acceptance of Sweden, 
Finland and Austria to the EU as some sort of signal that the 
acceptance of the Czech Republic might be speeded up, Klaus 
said, in reaction to the statement made by the Hungarian foreign 
minister that Hungary intended to ask for full EU membership.

  [Text] Prague March 3 (CTK) -- At his meeting with 
Chairman of the Slovenian Parliament Herman Rigelnik on Thursday 
[3 March], Chairman of the Czech Parliament Milan Uhde expressed 
his full support for Slovenia's efforts at joining European 
structures. 
  Uhde rejected any speculations aimed at the division of 
Europe into different spheres of influence. Democratic 
principles and abiding by the law are values most respected by 
the Czech Republic in evaluating states' authority. 
  Rigelnik stated that Slovenia would never forget the Czech 
Republic's contribution to the recognition of the independent 
Slovenian state. He said that the clear majority of Slovenian 
residents had been for their homeland's independence. However, 
if they had not been backed from abroad and "by friends", it 
would have been more difficult to attain independence, he said. 
  Uhde and Rigelnik expressed their interest in working out 
and adopting a standard Czech-Slovenian agreement on friendship 
and cooperation. 
  Rigelnik stressed that Slovenia was part of Central Europe, 
and that for 70 years it has been forcedly pushed to the Balkan 
region. He described as unacceptable such efforts of "other 
subjects" which he did not specify. 
  Rigelnik said that Europe still lacked a defence identity, a 
shortcoming which surfaced in its relation to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Referring to the reinforcement of the 
Russian military presence in the former Yugoslavia, he admitted 
that Russia was trying to strengthen its position in the Balkans. 
  Europe needs inspiration to consider its own set-up. That is 
why we must play an active role, he emphasised. 
  As to the West European protectionism, Rigelnik said that 
the 
Western Europe was willing to negotiate "with us", but that it 
was pursuing its own interests. Therefore a joint attitude of 
Slovenia, the Czech Republic and other countries undergoing 
transformation is important so that they can attain conditions 
of advantage in the process of their integration with Western 
European structures. 
  Rigelnik described Slovakia as a stable country. Its economy 
stabilised last year but it faces high unemployment, he added. 
Uhde told Rigelnik that the Czech Republic was relatively 
stable from both political and economic points of view.

  [Text] Prague March 3 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav 
Havel, Premier Vaclav Klaus, Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde, 
Foreign Minister Jozef Zieleniec and Defence Minister Antonin 
Baudys attended a meeting on the Czech Republic's security and 
foreign policy activities on Thursday [3 March], Havel told 
journalists after the meeting. 
  Also present were chairmen of the government coalition 
parties -- Jan Kalvoda of the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), 
Josef Lux of the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak 
People's Party (KDU-CSL) and Ivan Pilip of the Christian 
Democratic Party (KDS). Premier Klaus is also chairman of the 
fourth government coalition party -- the Civic Democratic Party 
(ODS). 
  Havel said the Czech Republic's security situation from the 
long-term perspective and the Czech security relations were 
discussed at the meeting, organised by Zieleniec. 
  Klaus characterised the meeting as a "conceptual philosophic 
debate" and "clarifying of general matters." He said that 
similar meetings serve to diminish the number of political 
statements which harm the Czech Republic's reputation abroad. 
  Baudys told journalists that neither his proposal for 
solving 
the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina nor the Czech-German relations 
have been discussed. 
  Parliament Deputy Chairman Jan Kasal told CTK today that 
Baudys has interrupted his vacation to attend the meeting. 
  Deputy Foreign Ministers Pavel Bratinka and Alexandr Vondra 
were reportedly also present at the meeting.

and 25 percent said they were quite satisfied. The remaining 34 
percent of those questioned answered negatively.

  [Text] Budapest, 1 March (MTI) -- Notwithstanding the air 
incident in Bosnia, there is no need for a new parliamentary 
resolution on NATO's AWACS surveillance mission in Hungary's 
airspace, because Budapest has no reason to suppose NATO would 
use intelligence gathered by AWACS jets for military purposes 
beyond their mandate from Hungary's legislature, Parliament's 
Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Laszlo Kovacs told MTI on 
Tuesday [1 March]. 
  "Nevertheless, Hungary should closely watch the South Slav 
[Yugoslav] region, since the downing of aircraft violating the 
flying ban over Bosnia may help escalate the armed conflict," he 
added. 
  Kovacs recalled that parliament initially gave permission 
for 
the passage of peacekeeping UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection 
Forces] forces through Hungary, or their possible withdrawal to 
Hungary's territory. The government referred to this when it 
approved the AWACS mission to carry humanitarian aid 
consignments to their destination. Parliamentary parties 
represented in the Defense and the Foreign Affairs Committees 
subsequently acknowledged the government's decision. Later, 
parliament also gave its tacit consent to AWACS taking control 
of the no-fly zone over Bosnia. 
  However, the AWACS mission changed in nature last April when 
the United Nations decided to have the aviation ban over Bosnia 
observed under all circumstances and by all possible means, if 
necessary even military means. In view of the new possibility 
that data collected by AWACS patrolling Hungary's airspace may 
be used to guide a battle in the air, the Defense and Foreign 
Affairs Committees decided to ask the government to warn NATO 
that AWACS mission had been permitted only peaceful purposes, 
and in any other case they need a parliamentary mandate under 
Hungary's Constitution. 
  When NATO set a deadline for Serb troops to pull their heavy 
weapons back from Sarajevo, and the possibility arose that AWACS 
may play some part in the ultimatum, Hungary told NATO it would 
be against its interests if AWACS jets were in its airspace 
during any air strikes on Bosnia, Kovacs said. 
  As for Monday's NATO action in Bosnia, nobody has said yet 
if 
it was aided by AWACS from Hungary or anywhere else, or whether 
there were surveillance planes at all in Hungary's airspace at 
the time. 
  "But as we have no reason to assume that NATO has forgotten 
last April's warning that AWACS jets in Hungary must not be used 
in military actions, the issue meed not be taken to parliament 
unless NATO asks to extend the mission's mandate," Kovacs said.

  [Text] Kiev, 3 March (MTI) -- "The Hungarian government 
does not recognize the shadow cabinet of Ruthenians in 
Subcarpathia. Nor is it prepared to receive its members in 
Budapest," Hungarian Ambassador to Ukraine Istvan Varga told 
Nikola Makarevich, first deputy foreign minister of Ukraine, in 
Kiev today. The ambassador said that the recognition of 
Ruthenians as a national minority is an internal affair of 
Ukraine. 
  The cabinet of the so-called Subcarpathian Rus was formed in 
the spring of 1993 by Ruthenians seeking independence from 
Ukraine. Hungary's law on national and ethnic minorities 
mentions the Ruthenians and Ukrainians separately, thereby 
recognizing the existence of a Ruthenian minority in Hungary.

  [Excerpts] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 2/3/1994 -- Foreign 
Ministry Spokesman Mircea Geoana announced at the today's news 
conference President Ion Iliescu's unofficial visit to China on 
11-14 March this year at the invitation of the Chinese 
Government. The Romanian president will be shown the special 
economic zones in the South of China, Shen Zhen and Zhu Hai, the 
Quandong Canton Province where, the Romanian delegation will 
meet with the local administration. The president will be 
accompanied by a group of Romanian businessmen, executives of 
state and private companies, and will examine the prospects of 
cooperation between the two countries. [passage omitted] 
  The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry read a communique at 
a 
Wednesday, March 2, press conference, saying that the Romanian 
Foreign Ministry has taken note with satisfaction of the 
agreement on the creation of a Croatian-Muslim Federation in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina and of a confederation made up of the said 
federation and Croatia. The Romanian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs considers that the putting in place of the provisions of 
this accord would represent an important step in finding a 
political solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in 
parallel with solutions for the other problems under 
negotiation. The Foreign Ministry expresses hope that this 
favorable moment will be made good use of in the interest of all 
the parties, of stability and security in the region, reads the 
communique. 
  The relations between Romania and Moldova are not function 
of 
the electoral cycle, which was already proved when elections 
were held in Romania, said Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mircea 
Geoana at his Wednesday, March 2, press conference, speaking 
about the elections held in the Republic of Moldova on February 
27. 
  The results of the polls reflect the state of mind of the 
population and they can be interpreted in terms of the economic 
and social difficulties confronting the Republic of Moldova, of 
the way in which the electorate took those aspects of the 
programmes of the parties running for seats in parliament that 
refer to the current situation of the country, mentioned the 
spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. An evaluation of the 
results has to take into account the conditions specific to the 
Republic of Moldova, the tensions appeared in consequence of the 
situation in Dniester and the districts inhabited by Gagauz, the 
general evolutions in the former Soviet space. "That is how the 
option for the left can be explained, the relative high percent 
of vote got by the bloc formed of the Socialist Party (the 
former Communist Party) and the "unity" party. It is 
interesting to mention, nevertheless, that the Democratic 
Agrarian Party had the biggest number of seats in the previous 
parliament and it has preserved its position, added Geoana. 
  At the 2 March weekly news conference of the Romanian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Spokesman Mircea Geoana referred to 
the statement of 28 February of the Council of Representatives 
of the Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania (UDMR), issued as a 
follow-up and in response to a letter sent to this body by 
Bishop Laszlo Tokes. The spokesman said that the letter 
confirms, once again, the extremist and anti-Romanian angle from 
which Pastor Tokes, encouraged by some UDMR leaders and 
political persons in Hungary, approaches his relations with the 
Romanian state and with UDMR itself. 
  "We express the hope that the UDMR leaders will distance 
themselves from the positions of the honorary president of their 
party, in whose view at present in Romania Ceausescu's policies 
on minorities are being continued. It is only to be regretted 
that the declaration issued by the UDMR's Council of 
Representatives practically reiterates all the accusations 
listed in the instruction-letter of Pastor Tokes. UDMR's 
declaration is accusing the Romanian authorities of lacking the 
political will to implement the amendments of the Council of 
Europe. We think it is high time UDMR understood that the 
addressee of these amendments is the Romanian society as a whole 
and that the observance of the commitments made before the 
Council on Romania's admission to it is a matter of national 
interest," the spokesman said. He also stressed that the 
withdrawal of UDMR from the Council for Ethnic Minorities -- the 
place where it would be but natural that such problems were 
debated -- reveals the lack of both real interest and pragmatism 
in solving them, and lack of consideration for the interests and 
role of the other ethnic minorities in Romania. 
  "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses the confidence 
that, joining the competent institutions in the rapid 
finalization of this process, all the forces interested in 
proving the democratic propensity and realities of Romania will 
bring a constructive and sincere contribution," the Foreign 
Ministry spokesman concluded.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 3 (CTK) -- President Michal Kovac 
is obliged to call a referendum within 30 days, because 
"everyone has to respect the will of the citizens, (as expressed 
in the recent referendum petition)" Premier Vladimir Meciar said 
on Wednesday at a rally of the governing Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), of which he is chairman. Meciar 
said that the situation in Slovakia was moving towards its 
denouement, and that elections "would divide the wheat from the 
chaff." 
  He said the president's refusal to appoint honorable 
chairman 
of the Slovak National Party (SNS) Jozef Prokes as foreign 
minister was an expression of lack of confidence in the HZDS, 
the SNS, the premier and the whole government (Prokes would 
replace the recently resigned Jozef Moravcik). Meciar attacked 
President Kovac for not having found time in half a year to 
receive him and Chairman of Parliament Ivan Gasparovic. 
Meciar's announcement that the HZDS would not invite Kovac to 
its conference was received with enthusiastic applause by those 
present. Michal Kovac was elected president as an HZDS 
candidate. 
  When Meciar read out a "question from the floor" as to 
whether it would not be best to join the parliamentary elections 
to the presidential ones, the crowd chanted "Dismiss, dismiss." 
  Meciar then commented on what some opposition politicians 
and 
foreign commentators had said about the referendum being a 
possible threat to Slovakia's membership of the Council of 
Europe. He said that Slovakia was observing all the commitments 
which membership entailed, and that there was no need to doubt 
the membership. The only unsolved question, he said, was that 
of the Council of Europe recommendation concerning bilingual 
names of towns and villages, but the Hungarian minority deputies 
had "spoiled this themselves." 
  Meciar said his recent journey to China and Thailand had 
been 
a success, and in a clear reference to Czech President Vaclav 
Havel's recent accident in Thailand, said he "had not broken a 
rib" there. Just to be certain, however, he had not got into the 
bath. 
  The premier expressed his dissatisfaction at the fact that 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrej Kozyrev had not arrived on his 
agreed visit to Slovakia on his February journey to the Visegrad 
Four countries [the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and 
Hungary]. Meciar said the postponement of the visit delayed the 
balancing of the trade deficit with Russia, which has reached 15 
billion Slovak crowns (about $500,000,000). Meciar added that 
Slovakia was asking the Russians for an explanation. (Kozyrev 
allegedly canceled his visit because of the instability on the 
Slovak political scene.)

  [Text] Bratislava, March 1 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government 
on Tuesday approved a proposed defense doctrine allowing for a 
reasonably-sized army which corresponds to the need for a 
rational deterrent in the national interest. 
  "Slovakia does not feel immediately threatened, but in the 
current military-political situation preserves the right and the 
ability to defend itself against possible military and 
non-military attack," the text of the doctrine reads. 
  The Slovak Republic wishes to promote its interests by 
peaceful cooperation with all democratic countries, with 
emphasis on neighboring countries, the doctrine continues. The 
aim of this cooperation is to form a European security system 
without military confrontation. The doctrine also confirms the 
interest of Slovakia in entering NATO and the Western European 
Union, and claims the right to share in the activities of the UN 
as a guarantee of peace and security. 
  The document contains an undertaking to strictly conform to 
the limits established by international agreements concerning 
the number of soldiers and the main types of weapons, and to aim 
at reduction in these respects. 
  The proposal also allows for the civil control of military 
power by parliament.

  [Text] Bratislava March 2 (CTK) -- Slovakia's national 
security is based on balanced relations with all European 
countries, the draft proposal of "Principles of Slovakia's 
National Security," approved by the government on Tuesday [1 
March], says. 
  In order to guarantee its security, Slovakia relies 
especially on NATO, the West European Union, the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United Nations, says 
the document which must be approved by the parliament. Active 
participation in the North Atlantic Council for Cooperation and 
in the Partnership for Peace project is an important starting 
point for NATO membership. 
  Internal security could be jeopardised by escalated 
nationalism and irredentism by a part of the population with 
possible tendencies to violate the integrity of the state 
territory, appearance and anti-constitutional activities of 
extremist political organisations, criminal activity committed 
in connection with privatisation and corruption in state bodies, 
the document says.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 1 (CTK) -- It is inadmissible for 
the only disposable resources from privatization to be in the 
hands of the National Property Fund (FNM) and for responsibility 
for the smooth running of the state to be transferred to the 
government, Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar said in a Slovak 
television debate on Tuesday evening. Meciar was justifying his 
decision not to sign the law on large privatization, which will 
be returned to parliament. 
  He said the law on large privatization had to ensure the 
connection between the FNM and the government, although it was 
not necessary that the finance minister be also chairman of the 
Inspection Body of the FNM. It was in the interest of 
parliament that a member of the government, possibly a state 
secretary, should be a member of the FNM board, Meciar said. 
  As well as being premier, Meciar is at present privatization 
minister and chairman of the FNM board. However, the amendment 
to the law on privatization forbids this. 
  If the government is not connected to the FNM, which will 
also be the holder of the disposable resources, the cabinet will 
not be capable of giving companies further guarantees for loans 
and credits abroad, because it will not be able to cover 
possible losses, Meciar warned. 
  "If we knew what sort of situation we might get into we 
would 
propose a state budget without a deficit. The deficit we would 
shift on to the FNM, as Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus has done," 
Meciar said.

  [Text] Prague March 1 (CTK) -- The current government must 
be immediately dismissed because, due to the emergence of the 
coalition duo Meciar-Slota, its policy has turned strongly to 
the right and starts to look like "fascism with human face," 
chairman of the ethnic Hungarian Egyutteles Miklos Duray told 
journalists today. 
  The anti-Hungarian and anti-Jewish statements by the new 
chairman of the Slovak National Party (SNS) Jan Slota, his talk 
about the superiority of the state-forming Slovak nation, but 
primarily the effort to "base the politics on the army" are 
dangerous signals that the country "has tremendous problems with 
democracy," Duray, a former dissident and chief leader of ethnic 
Hungarians, said. 
  Duray accused the two strongest opposition parties -- the 
Democratic Left Party (SDL) and the Christian Democratic 
Movement (KDH) -- that they had lost interest in passing a 
no-confidence vote in Meciar's government since they do not want 
to assume the burden of the unpopular measures which must be 
taken in the nearest future. 
  "The reluctance of the SDL and KDH and their maneuvering 
create space for politicians of Slota's sort," Duray warned. 
  Duray voiced discontent with statements by KDH Deputy 
Chairman Frantisek Miklosko on the "suicidal claims" on which 
Hungarian ethnic parties make their parliamentary support of the 
Slovak opposition conditional. Duray did not specify the claims.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 3 (CTK) -- Jan Slota, chairman of 
the minor government coalition partner, the Slovak National 
Party (SNS), said on Wednesday night that "the Slovak, not the 
communist-Hungarian cause will win" in early parliamentary 
elections. Early elections, the date of which has not been set 
as yet, are seen by both the government and the opposition as a 
solution to the current political crisis in Slovakia. 
  Speaking at a meeting of the government coalition, which is 
also formed by Premier Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Slota stressed that his party would 
not allow Slovaks to become an ethnic minority in the country's 
south. Southern Slovakia is home to most of the 560,000 ethnic 
Hungarians living in the country and constituting almost 11 per 
cent of its total population. 
  Slota hailed the departure of a group of people around the 
former SNS chairman, Ludovit Cernak, as "cleansing the party of 
the people who thought that the SNS could be built up on civic 
principles." 
  Parliament Deputy Chairman Augustin Marian Huska (HZDS) 
commented on the evident disharmony between the Castle, seat of 
President Michal Kovac, and Meciar saying that "the government 
is to govern and the president is to represent (the country)". 
  Kovac has refused to accept Meciar's candidates for the 
posts 
of privatization and foreign ministers, Ivan Lexa and Jozef 
Prokes, respectively. He has also decided not to call a 
referendum on stripping the deputies who have left the parties 
for which they had been elected of their mandates because this 
contradicted the constitution, as Kovac's spokesman Anton Bodis 
put it. 
  Huska called on the Slovaks to rid themselves of their 
"slavish souls" and to demonstrate their ability to defend their 
statehood. He stressed that since the times of (9th-century) 
Prince Pribina "we have been endangered." 
  Deputy Premier and SNS honorary Chairman Jozef Prokes said 
Kovac probably had refused to put him in charge of the Foreign 
Ministry (to replace Jozef Moravcik, HZDS, who resigned last 
week) because "I dared to express the doubt that the best way of 
conducting talks with (U.S. President Bill) Clinton (during his 
January visit to Prague) was to read him a half-hour lecture." 
  Meciar called Kovac's meeting with Clinton "a historically 
wasted opportunity." 
  Prokes called false the claims that it was not possible to 
cooperate with Meciar because his own case testified to the 
contrary.

  [Text] Bratislava March 3 (CTK) -- In the process of the 
division of the former federal property the Czech Republic 
"robbed Slovakia of tens, or hundreds of billions of crowns," 
Jan Slota, recently elected as chairman of the Slovak National 
Party (SNS), said at a press conference on Thursday [3 March]. 
  The division of the Czechoslovak Airlines was also 
controversial, as the privatisation was "more than strange", and 
led to the airlines falling extremely easily to the Czech 
Republic. Slota pointed to the problematic division of federal 
immovables, for which Slovakia got nothing. The situation was 
similar with the property of the federal sea shipping company 
and the army. Slota said he was surprised about the Czech 
Defence Ministry's present offering military airports for 
commercial purposes. 
  SNS Deputy Chairman Juraj Molnar added that "Slovakia was 
less harmed during the property division process than during the 
existence of the Czechoslovak Federative Republic" (from March 
1990 until December 31, 1992). However, he appreciated the 
civilised manner of the two republics split apart, and expressed 
the hope that the future relations between the two countries 
would be civilised as well. "Many wrongs have been done, but we 
prefer to forgive them," Molnar noted. 
  Referring to the SNS's cooperation with its senior 
government 
coalition partner, the Premier Vladimir Meciar-led Movement for 
a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Slota confirmed that the SNS would 
support the HZDS's efforts to solve the current crisis through 
early elections. Asked if cooperation was possible between such 
two strong personalities as himself and Meciar, Slota said he 
saw no reason for doubting this cooperation in advance. He and 
Meciar always reached agreement in basic questions, and Meciar 
always "did what he promised", Slota said. 
  He stated he accepted the decision by President Michal Kovac 
not to appoint SNS Honorary Chairman Jozef Prokes Foreign 
Minister as a decision made by the head of the state. However, 
he stressed that he insisted on Prokes's being the suitable 
candidate. 
  Slota dismissed speculations that he could invite Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russia's Liberal Democratic Party, 
to visit Slovakia.

  [Text] Prague March 2 (CTK) -- The Committee for Legal 
Affairs and Human Rights of the CE (Council of Europe) said that 
Slovakia was no longer observing the pledges it had assumed when 
it was accepted into Council of Europe, Robert Fico, a leader of 
the opposition Democratic Left Party (SDL), told Slovak Radio 
today. 
  Most criticism regarded the "roadsign bill" on bilingual 
names of communities, parliament did not pass, as well as the an 
amended bill on names and surnames requiring the Slovak suffix 
-ova for Hungarian female names, said Fico who represented 
Slovakia on Tuesday's [1 March] meeting of the CE Committee. 
  "The law is good, but its interpretation is disputable," 
Fico 
said, adding that "the atmosphere in the Committee was 
orientated unequivocally against Slovakia." 
  The controversial issue of referendum on the loss of 
mandates 
of the deputies who quit their parties was not officially 
raised, Fico reported. There was, however, certain fear "at 
least" at the unofficial level of the CE. 
  The bilingual roadsigns and use of Hungarian names and 
surnames are the most frequent demands of ethnic Hungarians 
which are supported even by Slovak President Michal Kovac.

  [Text] Dunajska Streda, West Slovakia, Feb 26 (CTK) -- The 
signature of "historical peace" between Slovakia and Hungary is 
probable, but it cannot be said now when it will be made 
possible, Geza Entz, Hungarian government's state secretary and 
head of the Government Office for ethnic Hungarians living 
abroad, told CTK on Saturday. 
  Entz, who attended an assembly of the Hungarian Christian 
Democratic Movement (MKDH), pointed out discrepancies in 
statements by Premier Vladimir Meciar who speaks about his 
intention to conclude a peace agreement with Hungary on the one 
hand, but warns against the danger of Hungarian capital in 
southern Slovakia on the other hand. 
  Entz said that improvement in Hungarian-Slovak relations was 
hampered mainly by the unwillingness of the Slovak Government 
and political parties to discuss common problems and to solve 
the status of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia. 
  He also met with Slovak President Michal Kovac with whom he 
shares "many" views, as he put it. He praised Kovac's open 
support for some demands of the Hungarian minority the 
fulfillment of which was also recommended by the Council of 
Europe when it was admitting Slovakia as its member last June. 
  Kovac supports the Hungarians' demands for bilingual sign 
posts to be placed in communities with a mixed population and 
the use of Hungarian female surnames without the Slovak suffix 
-ova.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Koev: "Bulgarian-Macedonian Talks"] </F>
  [Text] Skopje, March 3 (BTA) -- A Bulgarian delegation led 
by Deputy Foreign Minister Dimitur Ikonomov arrived in the 
Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM]. Today Ikonomov was received by President Kiro 
Gligorov to whom he delivered a message by Bulgarian President 
Zhelyu Zhelev. 
  The message, a reply to a recent letter by Gligorov, 
emphasizes Bulgaria's principled stand for the promotion of 
relations with Macedonia. It stresses Bulgaria's desire to 
develop with its neighbours, including the young Macedonian 
state, a policy based on mutual understanding and friendship. 
  In a special message to President Zhelev, the Macedonian 
president had thanked him for the support the Republic of 
Macedonia received from Bulgaria after Greece had imposed a 
unilateral economic embargo against it. 
  The exchange of personal messages between the presidents of 
Bulgaria and Macedonia is an important part of direct contacts 
between the state leaders of the two neighbouring countries and 
has a great significance for the regulation of bilateral 
relations. Political observers here see this fact as evidence of 
the willingness of Sofia and Skopje to promote cooperation in 
the difficult situation in the Balkans, leaving behind points of 
dispute accumulated in the past.

  [Text] Tirana, March 3 (ATA) -- About 40 per cent of the 
population in the former republic of Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] is of Albanian 
nationality. Nevertheless, since the independence, this state 
has functioned as a national state of the Macedonian people, 
says a letter of the (Macedonian) People's Democratic Party 
[PDP] addressed to the CSCE Council of Ministers recently. 
  The Macedonian Constitution and many other laws have thus 
discriminated against the Albanian people especially in the 
fields of education, culture, and citizenship, the letter 
stresses. The Law on Nationality in Macedonia has declared some 
100,000 Albanians as persons without nationality. 
  The government in Macedonia is in general centralized while 
local governments do not exist. The central government is made 
up almost wholly of ethnic Macedonians with the occasional 
symbolic Albanian, although there are some 300 Albanian jurists 
looking for work in Macedonia. Non-representation of the 
Albanians in the structures of the present government is 
justified by the government as being inherited from the past, 
the letter says, but this is not convincing because new 
institutions, such as diplomacy, are being set up on the basis 
of nationalities.

<F P=106> [Hugh Pope article: "Albanians at Crossroads In New </F>
Republic"] 
  [Text] It was a bloodless coup in the mist-shrouded town 
of Tetovo, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), 
that captured the headquarters and seals of office of the 
country's main ethnic Albanian party. Hardly a major threat, it 
seemed, to the security of the Balkans. 
  But if violence in former Yugoslavia does shift from Bosnia 
to the tense ethnically Albanian Serbian province of Kosovo, the 
actions of Albanians in the FYROM will be a key to whether the 
fighting spreads. The radical faction that seized control in 
Tetovo last month will clearly not take any threat to their 
kinsmen, just over the border in Kosovo, lying down. Even 
moderates believe the risks are great. 
  "War in Kosovo probably means war in Macedonia, even a 
Balkan 
war," said Servet Arviu, a minister of state from the Albanian 
minority. Any such conflict would test the FYROM's ethnic 
balances and the fragile Slav-Albanian coalition government. 
  Strains have already risen since Mr Arviu's moderate faction 
was ousted by more nationalist radicals during a February 
congress of the ethnic Albanians' Party for Democratic 
Prosperity. 
  The results of the congress are still contested, but 
Albanian 
Muslims are now at a crossroads critical for the future 
stability of this country, where they have a very different 
language, script, religion and culture from the Orthodox 
Christian Slav majority. 
  Shazim Mehmeti, a hard-faced ideologue from the radical 
faction, tried to calm any worries. "There won't be a big 
change. But we will insist that our parliamentary group does 
not serve as mere decoration," he said. He added his gratitude 
for the goodwill of Albania proper, emerging from decades of 
isolation just over the mountains to the west and beginning to 
make its psychological weight felt. 
  The people of the FYROM are also trying to stay calm. 
"Albania is trying to strengthen the idea of one Albania and 
has links to the radical elements. It could be dangerous, but 
it's unlikely. 
  Albania will be the big issue in 10 to 15 years' time, if 
current demographic trends continue. Right now they can do 
nothing. They have no foreign support," [quotation marks as 
published] said a commentator, Saso Ordanovski. 
  If left alone, the FYROM still seems far from the brink of 
any ethnic bloodbath. The government has tried hard to keep the 
nationalist genie in the bottle. The Turkish ambassador, for 
instance, said that ethnic Turks in the FYROM were the 
best-treated in the Balkans. 
  Enlightened policies by the 65 per cent majority FYROM Slavs 
and President Kiro Gligorov have helped. Albanians have five of 
22 ministries in the coalition government and 23 seats in the 
120-seat parliament, most of them intellectuals from the 
moderate Albanian party faction. The Albanians are being 
promised a bigger share in government and investment in Tetovo 
and other Albanian-populated areas of the western FYROM. 
  The Defence Minister, Vladi Popovski, said the ethnic 
Albanian percentage of new conscripts had gone up from 14 to 26 
per cent in the past year, and that their share of the officer 
corps had doubled to 3.9 per cent. He did not believe that 
there were any more large armed Albanian networks like one 
uncovered last November. 
  Nobody is sure of the exact proportion of ethnic Albanians 
among the FYROM's 2.2 million people. Officially they make up 
21 per cent of the population, but Albanians claim up to 40 per 
cent. 
  "We managed to maintain peace in Macedonia. The people in 
power know what peace means and the price of peace, and the 
international community has also shown far more prior concern 
for Macedonia (than Bosnia)," Mr Arviu said, although his face 
was drawn with worry about the long-festering political split 
among the once united ethnic Albanians. 
  Another problem is the troubled economy. The FYROM has just 
embarked on an IMF stabilisation programme and is subject to a 
total blockade of its main trade route by Greece. 
  Ethnic Albanians wanting schools and other benefits are 
being 
told to be patient and that any favouritism could provok FYROM 
Slav nationalists, who have been a declining force since 1991. 
That could change. "Albanians are the biggest real problem of 
Macedonia. They smuggle, they are unemployed, they want work, 
schools, autonomous areas. They have large families. Illegal 
immigrants come from Albania and Albanian bandits attack our 
villages," said the young manager of a clothes shop in the 
capital, Skopje. "They want a state within a state. It started 
out like that in Bosnia. Everyone is very pessimistic."

  [Text] Prishtina, February 28 (ATA) -- The building of the 
Academy of Arts and Sciences of Kosova, which this week was 
usurped and closed by the Serbian police, is given now to the 
Deaf-Mute People Association of Kosova, reports the Serbian 
means of information, referring to the installed Serbian 
governor of Kosova, Mr. Milosh Simovic, who says that "the 
academy has been tolerated enough because the decision for its 
abolishment has been taken since two years ago." 
  The Academy of Arts and Sciences of Kosova has been 
established since sixteenth years ago according to a decision of 
the Kosova Assembly, during the time when Kosova was an 
autonomous region. 
  "The academy is of Kosova and it will exist and act as the 
highest institution of science, art and culture in Kosova" is 
stressed in the many reactions done against the Serbian attacks 
over the academy. 
  The Kosovar Academy of Helsinki, expressing his indignation 
to the closing of the building of the academy and appealing and 
asking help from the international institutions, stresses that 
"the usurpation of the building of the academy is a signal that 
shows that the Serbian authorities with premeditation want to 
abet the inter-ethnic conflict in Kosova, which will have 
unforeseen consequences not only for the Albanians of Kosova, 
but even for all the Balkan region.

  [Text] A flagrant incident occurred at the border with 
Yugoslavia. The Public Order Ministry spokesman reports that at 
about 1335 today another flagrant incident happened in Pogaj 
village in Has District, near border marker D/7. 
  A Yugoslav border unit, accompanied by dogs, opened fire 
toward two Albanian children who were guarding their cow, 
without going beyond the border line, but close to it. As soon 
as the shots were heard, the commander of our border post, 
together with a soldier, left immediately. But with no warning 
at all, the Yugoslav post of Goruzhup, in former Yugoslavia, 
opened fire against our border guards, who were 100 meters away 
from the border line and approximately 350 meters away from 
their post. Soldier Saimir Pal Zefi from Mirdite District was 
wounded from these very sudden shots. 
  This is a very flagrant event because there was not even the 
slightest provocation or pretext from our part. Our member of 
the joint local commission for solving border incidents and 
representatives of EC observers mission went immediately to the 
scene of the incident. 
  The Public Order Ministry strongly protests these criminal 
and unjustifiable acts that are increasing day by day.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry </F>
on 6 March; place not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] As reported, on 5 March 1994 in Pogaj village in 
Has District, near border marker D-7, 100 meters into Albanian 
territory, 20-year-old soldier Saimir Pal Zefi from Mirdite 
District was wounded by fire from the Yugoslav border post of 
Goruzhup. 
  The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Albania strongly 
protests this act by Yugoslav border forces, which is another 
flagrant and revolting act with open anti-Albanian aims. This 
act refutes the demagogy of statements and memorandums of the 
Yugoslav side, which blame Albania for the incidents on the 
border between both countries as well as for the so-called lack 
of alertness of the Albanian side to resolve problems between 
them. 
  The wounding of the Albanian soldier yesterday increased the 
number of the Albanians killed or wounded on the northern border 
to 22 people, when no Serb has been wounded or killed by 
Albanian border forces. 
  Such criminal acts, both in the past and now, are 
premeditated and are committed at a time when the international 
community is engaged in resolving, peacefully and through 
dialogue, the conflicts that have broken out in the former 
Yugoslavia and preventing them from expanding to other areas. 
These acts are committed to increase tension on the border 
between both countries, to consequently increase the level of 
insecurity and tension in the Balkans by instigating situations 
with unprecedented consequences, and to accompany the 
intensified movements of the Serbian Army on the border with 
Albania and within Kosova. 
  Such acts, along with the murder of an Albanian by Serbian 
soldiers on the Kosovar-Macedonian border, the trial 
fabrications against Albanians, and the closure of the Academy 
of Sciences and Arts of the Republic of Kosova, complete the 
tableau of the Serbian policy of genocide and oppression against 
the Albanian population in Kosova and the methods of pressure 
and political and military blackmail by Milosevic against the 
Albanian state. 
  Albania protests such irresponsible acts and, before the 
world public, again denounces the provokers of such dangerous 
situations, who are the same authors of the bloodshed in the 
former Yugoslavia, the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the ethnic 
cleansing, and the massacres against the simple people.

<F P=106> ["p.re." report: "Unclear Situation on the Threshold of the </F>
Nano Trial -- `No Illegal Rally' -- The Socialist Party Asks 
Court for Help"] 
  [Text] Tirana -- The refusal of the request by the 
Socialist Party [PS] to hold rallies is going to the 
Constitutional Court. Luan Shaholli, chairman of the PS 
Management Committee for Tirana, commenting on the police's 
negative response to the rally planned for today, hoped that the 
Constitutional Court will now issue a pronouncement on the 
"repeated violations of the law by the police." Thus, on the 
day before the trial of Fatos Nano, a day that the PS Management 
Committee has declared "a day of nationwide protest against 
violations of basic human rights and freedom," the party's 
leaders are obliged to issue an appeal not to organize "illegal 
activities." Nonetheless, "we will continue to demand permits 
for rallies, even though we have hitherto been given arbitrary 
refusals," PS Deputy Chairman Servet Pellumbi said. Meanwhile, 
the Public Order Ministry issued a statement the day before 
yesterday laying particular stress on incitements to illegal 
assemblies just before the Nano trial and warning that it "will 
use the force of the law against anyone who attempts to exert 
pressure against Albanian justice." 
  The public announcement of today's gathering in Skenderbeg 
Square first appeared in the pages of the Socialist newspaper 
ZERI I POPPULIT. However, the PS leaders say that the replies 
from the Public Order Ministry and from the capital city's First 
and Second Police Commissariats refusing permission for this 
rally came on Tuesday [2 March]. "Concerning the 4 March rally, 
we will act according to the law," Luan Shahollari told GAZETA 
SHQIPTARE, "but we will also denounce these negative replies in 
our press." According to Shahollari, the publication of the 
negative replies from the police would be more than enough to 
contact the people who had earlier been informed about the rally 
to be held in Skenderbeg Square. Meanwhile, PS Deputy Chairman 
Servet Pellumbi said that people interested in the rally would 
in the normal course of events realize that permission for it 
had been refused because "the rally can only take place if the 
people organizing it appear and make their speeches." Pellumbi 
said that requests to hold this rally will be repeated every 
day, regardless of refusals, but he again appealed, "Our 
guideline is to always behave in accordance with the law, thus 
avoiding all kinds of confrontation. 
  While the police have now refused permission for the rally 
in 
Tirana, PS management comittees in many other districts have 
asked for identical rallies in their respective towns. "As the 
PS Management Committee decided," Pellumbi said, "almost all 
districts have made requests to hold peaceful assemblies, but we 
still have not been informed in which towns they have been 
approved." Meanwhile, the Public Order Ministry spokesman has 
denounced the PS and its newspaper for "continually issuing 
calls for and inciting illegal assemblies on the threshold of 
the trials of Fatos Nano, Ramiz Alia, and the other blockmen 
[former Albanian Workers Party leadership]." 
  The Public Order Ministry had meanwhile guaranteed order, 
calm, and stability to the judiciary in its work, also warning 
that "All those breaking the law will answer to the law, whoever 
they may be."

  [Text] The Public Order Ministry spokesman reports that on 
the eve of the trial of former Prime Minister Fatos Nano 
yesterday, despite warnings by the Public Order Ministry, former 
Interior Minister Gramoz Ruci mobilized groups of Enverists 
[Enver Hoxha followers] and former State Security officers and 
tried to create conflicts among the people in the cities of 
Berat and Kucove and in some other centers. 
  With the same scheme, too, former State Security officers as 
well as leaders of the former Labor Party and the Socialist 
Party tried to destabilize public order in Tirana yesterday 
afternoon. The police took legal measures by apprehending 
several of them. The situation in Tirana is very quiet today 
and the trial is being held normally.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Shkoder Cannot Become a Fortress of </F>
Crime and Corruption -- Journalist Gjergj Zefi Assaulted"] 
  [Text] The journalist Gjergj Zefi, former editor-in-chief 
of the newspaper LAJMETARI and now deputy editor-in-chief of 
ALEANCA and deputy chairman of the Democratic Alliance's 
National Assembly, was hit above the eye by a solid object at 
the entrance to the lane where he lives at about 2000 on 2 
March. This act came after continual threats against this 
journalist after his articles denouncing corruption and crime in 
Shkoder. The Shkoder Branch of the Association of Professional 
Journalists issues the following statement: 
<H3>  We Will Write Again Against Those Trying To Turn Shkoder 
Into a "Fortress" of Crime and Corruption </H3>
  We Shkoder journalists express our deep indignation and 
protest at the barbaric act against our colleague Gjergj Zefi on 
the evening of 2 March. This happened precisely at a time when 
unrestrained attacks are being launched against our free press 
and especially against opposition and independent newspapers. 
The state's attacks against us have alternated with attacks by 
hooligans who are nothing but paid mercenaries. This has 
especially happened in Shkoder, where we may also place on 
record the assaults some months ago against the journalist Alban 
Kraja, director of LAJMETARI. Other oblique threats against 
other journalists of our association culminated in the ambush in 
the dark of the journalist Gjergj Zefi, currently deputy 
editor-in-chief of ALEANCA, at the entrance to the lane where he 
lives. We also note that the attacks against Gjergj Zefi come 
from two quarters. On the one hand, there is the procurator, 
the investigator, and the state, who bring him to court over his 
articles and statements in newspapers. All this is in order to 
threaten and gag the brave journalist Gjergj Zefi, whose 
articles have denounced crime and corruption in Shkoder. This 
is also in order to gag all of us, so that we will not mention 
what is happening. Nevertheless, we once again express our 
determination not to falter on the road on which we have 
embarked but to courageously denounce corruption and crime, in 
order not to allow Shkoder to be turned from a bastion of 
democracy and culture into a fortress of crime, terror, and 
corruption, as those who ordered the assault on our colleague 
Gjergj Zefi would wish.

  [Text] [Announcer] A ceremony took place at Cotroceni 
Palace today in the presence of Romanian President Ion Iliescu. 
The four ministers who have been newly appointed to the 
Vacaroiu cabinet through Decree No. 26 of 6 March 1994 took the 
oath during the ceremony. Here is the text of the document that 
Dan Nastase, head of the Presidential Chancellor's Office, read 
at the beginning of the ceremony: 
  [Begin Nastase recording] Decree on release from and 
appointment to the position of minister: 
  In accordance with Article 85, Paragraph 2; Article 94, 
Paragraph C; Article 99, Paragraph 1; and Article 105 of the 
Romanian Constitution, and taking into consideration the 
proposals advanced by the prime minister for a government 
reshuffle, Romania's president decrees the following: 
  Article 1: Petre Ninosu, minister of justice; Niculae 
Spiroiu, minister of national defense; George Ioan Danescu, 
minister of interior; and Paul Teodoru, minister of 
transportation, are released from their position as members of 
the Romanian Government. 
  Article 2: The following persons are appointed to the 
position of members of the government: Iosif Gavril Chiuzbaian, 
minister of justice; Gheorghe Tinca, minister of national 
defense; Ioan Doru Taracila, minister of interior; and Aurel 
Novac, minister of transportation. 
  The document is signed by the president of Romania Ion 
Iliescu [end recording] 
  The four ministers read and signed the oath, an event that 
was followed by President Ion Iliescu's act of signing the 
required protocol. The head of the Romanian state then made the 
following speech: 
  [Begin Iliescu recording] Mr. Prime Minister, Ministers: We 
have carried out a natural constitutional act in our political 
life upon proposals advanced by the prime minister, by taking 
into account reasons connected with the actions and efficiency 
of the government's activity and on the basis of consultations 
with the political formation that is supporting the government. 
Thus we have carried out this reshuffle. 
  The new element that appears in the structure of our 
government is in line with a more general practice in other 
European countries, namely, a civilian is appointed to the helm 
of the Ministry of National Defense. 
  This is our debut in this practice, although we have had a 
civilian minister at the head of the Ministry of Interior in the 
period following the December 1989 revolution. I believe that 
the proposals and thus the changes that followed will bring 
about the necessary moving spirit to improve activity. 
  I would also like to thank the ministers who have carried 
out 
their activities and their duties so far for their work. Each of 
them individually will receive a new assignment. Mr. Spiroiu 
will represent us at Brussels and will continue implementing the 
measures required by the Partnership for Peace. Mr. Danescu, in 
his capacity of a professional, will remain the major assistant 
at the Ministry of Interior in work aimed at modernizing this 
ministry. Paul Teodoru will assist the new minister in 
fulfilling his duties for a while, although the transfer is not 
so complicated considering that Mr. Novac has worked in the 
leadership of the ministry and will receive assignments from the 
government. As far as Mr. Ninosu is concerned, as lomg as he is 
healthy he will receive new assignments. 
  I would like to ask the new ministers to approach with 
utmost 
seriousness the problems that the government and the respective 
ministries are currently facing and to take over the duties 
incumbent on them in the shortest time possible. We should 
establish a united and cohesive team in the government to 
continue the complex and difficult program for this year's 
activity. This is an essential year for the reform as a whole 
and for the economic reform as a central goal of the government. 
Actions that started last year will be finalized and those 
actions will have to lead to a certain curbing of inflation, the 
stabilization of the national currency, and a certain 
stabilization of economic life in general. 
  There are also a number of actions necessary to improve 
activity in all the other areas, the affected ministries, and 
the important sectors, where the processes of consolidating 
state institutions will make new steps forward. 
  I would like to wish for success in the mission for the new 
ministers and the government as a whole. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Senate President Oliviu Gherman, Prime Minister 
Nicolae Vacaroiu, and Viorel Hrebenciuc, general secretary of 
the government, attended the ceremony. Prime Minister Vacaroiu 
introduced the new holders of the four ministerial portfolios.

  [Text] During a ceremony at Cotroceni Palace today Prime 
Minister Vacaroiu introduced the new holders of the four 
ministerial portfolios. 
  [Begin Vacaroiu recording] As you well know, the examination 
of the possibility for a government reshuffle lasted for quite a 
long time and created a number of problems in the operation of 
the executive. Eventually, together with the ruling party, the 
PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania], we reached the 
conclusion that in the current very difficult stage, in 
practical terms it would be best to have a monocolor government 
team which includes PDSR representatives and some experts. As I 
mentioned before, we mainly thought that the government team 
should include highly qualified people and good organizers who 
are able to implement the reform program for 1994, which is a 
very complex program. 
  At the same time, we also took into consideration the 
practice in most countries and the recommendations of the 
Council of Europe regarding the appointment of civilians, people 
with high professional qualifications, to the helms of two 
ministries, the Ministry of National Defense and the Interior 
Ministry. 
  For example, we chose Gheorghe Tinca, who, as you know, has 
occupied the position of state secretary with the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. He is a lawyer by profession. He worked on 
disarmament issues for a very long time with the United Nations. 
At the same time, he is a person of integrity, with good 
professional training. 
  Doru Taracila, currently vice president of the Senate, will 
occupy the position of minister of interior. He is also a 
lawyer by profession, with a good training, and a person whom we 
believe will bring a new moving drive in the activity of 
finalizing the reform process. But in a primary and very 
delicate area, we believe Mr. Taracila will carry out a much 
more intensive activity to fight crime and corruption in Romania 
together with Mr. Danescu, who will continue to occupy the 
position of secretary of state and will be deputy interior 
minister. 
  Our nomination for the position of justice minister, a 
nomination accepted by Romania's president, was Mr. Chiuzbaian. 
He is also a lawyer by profession, currently president of the 
Lawyers' Union of Romania and general inspector in the Ministry 
of Justice. We believe that he has the necessary qualifications 
to continue what we have started with Senator Ninosu in this 
area of reform of the legal system, and we hope that in a very 
short time he will succeed in finalizing this reform and, at the 
same time, to lay a new basis for the functioning of prosecuting 
magistracies in provinces. 
  We proposed Paul Novac for the position of minister of 
transportation, a proposal also accepted by Romania's president. 
Mr. Novac currently holds the position of secretary of state in 
the Ministry of Transportation. He is a fine expert. He has 
held positions at various levels in the respective specialty, he 
has managed to fulfill his duties correctly, and we believe that 
in this very difficult ministry, due to the variety of 
activities that it has to coordinate, he will succeed in 
fulfilling his duty and giving a new impetus to the reform 
process in Romania. 
  These are the four nominations that we have submitted to 
President Ion Iliescu. Following the analysis carried out in 
these past days, these nominations have been accepted, and here 
we are. Today this acceptance took concrete shape in the 
appointment of the new ministers. 
  I extend them heartfelt wishes for success and, first, I 
wish 
to say that I am convinced that they will adjust very rapidly 
and we will succeed in establishing a competent government team 
that is capable of implementing the program of reform, which, as 
I have already mentioned, is a very difficult and complex 
program. At the same time, however, it is a program expected by 
the population, because its goal is to end the current crisis, 
to reduce inflation as much as possible, and to create an 
adequate framework that will allow for the improvement of 
people's standard of living. 
  In conclusion, I want to express the hope that the political 
forces represented in parliament and trade unions will be at our 
side and will support the new government team in this difficult 
period. Thank you. [end recording]

  [Text] After the Cotroceni Palace ceremony in which the 
newly appointed ministers took the oath, President Iliescu, in a 
statement made at the request of journalists, said that initial 
discussions referred to certain circumstances and to a certain 
pact with the parties that are included in the so-called 
government arc. New elements appeared in the relations of the 
PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] with those parties, 
including a new context of negotiations for a new political 
climate and the possibility of establishing a broader framework 
of parliamentary cooperation, which does not mean inclusion in 
government. 
  Ion Iliescu noted that these negotiations were assessed as 
interesting, constructive, and capable of opening up a new stage 
in the development of political life which would grant more 
substance to the joint efforts of all political parties. 
  Asked by one of the journalists to reveal whether in the 
near 
future the establishment of a government team with the 
parliamentary opposition is possible, President Ion Iliescu said 
that in a democratic system, regardless of participation or 
nonparticipation in the government, all political forces are in 
one way or another drawn and absorbed into the joint effort to 
achieve the country's reconstruction. 
  In a democratic practice, Iliescu said, the opposition has a 
constructive role, even when it is very virulent and aggressive 
toward the ruling party, and it makes a useful act of active 
political and social criticism. 
  Romania's president further said: I believe that we can 
enter a stage of normality, of civilized and constructive 
dialogue, which will serve everybody. A government with the 
opposition is another question that presumes other steps to 
achieve a possible platform for unity in a broader government 
team. It would not be wrong to achieve such a thing, said Ion 
Iliescu, who added that he has always been open to such a 
formula. This presupposes a better platform and he will follow 
the current talks between the PDSR and the other parties. Ion 
Iliescu also said that he believes that before talking about a 
government coalition, it is necessary to achieve a platform 
through agreement.

  [Text] We view the current government reshuffle as a 
continuation of the crypto-communist government and the choice 
of the date of 6 March was a mistake, Corneliu Coposu, president 
of the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party [PNTCD], said 
today at a news conference of this political formation. 
  Referring to the changes made, he emphasized that the PNTCD 
views the appointment of a civilian at the helm of the Army as 
inopportune and that General Niculae Spiroiu's replacement will 
exert a negative effect, while the presence of Iosif Gavril 
Chiuzbaian as head of the Ministry of Justice could be 
beneficial. 
  Insofar as the replacement of the other ministers is 
concerned, in the opinion of the PNTCD this looks like a change 
of cadres. 
  Keeping the prime minister in his position, Coposu 
continued, 
proves that the ruling party is trying to avoid parliament 
control and to postpone early elections. 
  In conclusion, Coposu specified that the PNTCD believes that 
the reshuffle has not contributed to the consolidation of the 
government nor has it ensured its stability at home and abroad. 
  We want to recall that Coposu made a similar statement 
during 
an earlier program this morning. In addition, the PNTCD leader 
said that he hopes for a positive conclusion of the current 
negotiations between the Social Democracy Party of Romania 
[PDSR] and the other political formations, so that by the 
beginning of summer a viable government may be formed that is 
able to cope with the current crisis situation. If this is not 
the case, then early elections are the only solution.

  [Text] We have received for publication the text of the 
following press communique from the spokesman of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs: 
  Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: As is known, 
on 6 March 1994, in a sociological poll initiated on the basis 
of a presidential decree of 4 February 1994, the citizens of the 
Republic of Moldova were called upon to answer the following 
question: 
  Do you want the Republic of Moldova to develop as an 
independent, united, and indivisible state within the borders of 
the date of the proclamation of its sovereignty, 23 June 1990, a 
state that will promote a policy of neutrality, maintain 
mutually advantageous relations with all world countries, and 
guarantee equal rights to all its citizens in accordance with 
the norms of international law? 
  The poll was explained through the absolute need to 
stabilize 
the sociopolitical and economic situation, create favorable 
conditions to strengthen the independence of the Republic of 
Moldova, and ensure its territorial integrity. 
  For us, it is only an exercise of testing public opinion and 
we will treat it as such. We note, however, the tendency of 
certain forces to unilaterally and generally view it as a firm 
answer to a question to which only history has the right to 
provide an answer. It is regrettable that these forces continue 
to make efforts to win political capital and to exacerbate 
Romaniaphobia. 
  At this time, too, we very firmly reject such attempts to 
distract public opinion from the real problems and causes of the 
situation in the Republic of Moldova and from the real threats 
to its independence. 
  Romania was the first state to recognize the independence of 
the Republic of Moldova, to which it has granted and continues 
to grant its entire political, diplomatic, and moral support to 
contribute to its affirmation at the international level. 
  The Romanian Government has pledged to grant material 
assistance for the benefit of all the citizens of the Republic 
of Moldova to overcome the difficult times generated by the 
economic and social difficulties they are confronting. 
  Romania will continue to support the consolidation of the 
independence of the Republic of Moldova and will work toward 
economic integration of the two Romanian states and toward 
strengthening our common cultural and spiritual area, the press 
communique of Romania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs concludes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador Virgil Constantinescu, general </F>
director of the General Directorate for Security and 
Euro-Atlantic Integration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, by 
Alexandra Dragoi; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Dragoi] What does participation in the 
`Partnership for Peace' program mean for Romania? 
  [Constantinescu] By participating in the `Partnership for 
Peace' program and trying to get completely involved, Romania is 
pursuing its integration into NATO structures. It views this 
program just as an initial stage, bearing in mind that there are 
difficulties, both logistical and over the incompatibility of 
our military systems. The application of this accord needs time 
and problems will probably surface as we go along; nor do its 
initiators have a clear image of what it should include. 
  Romania was particularly interested in this initiative for 
its comprehensive nature, because it does not draw a new 
demarcation line in Europe. We were the first country to sign 
this document. Now we are at the stage of preparing a document 
to consist of two parts: one linked to the political aspect -- 
the continuation of the economic and democratic reform process, 
observance of the CSCE norms, the transparency of the military 
doctrines -- and another linked to the military aspect, namely 
to offers in the military area. Linked to this aspect, by the 
end of the year a first elite battalion, including volunteers, 
will be made available for peacekeeping actions. Its training 
will be complex and will include English-language lessons. The 
individual 16 plus 1 Partnership Program is being worked out in 
Brussels; it will represent the foundation of cooperation among 
NATO's partner states. Joint exercises will also take place. 
  Romania also wants to capitalize on the advantages in the 
political area that participation in this accord offers, such as 
settling the differences of opinion that mark relations with 
Hungary. One of the conditions is to solve the disputes that 
still exist; it being viewed as a "historic reconciliation." 
True, no guarantees for security are offered like those offered 
by NATO, but a mechanism is established for consultations should 
problems of that kind emerge; the given state has the 
possibility of approaching the Alliance. 
  We should not forget that Partnership for Peace has an 
economic aspect, namely partnership for development, offering 
access to NATO programs in such areas as: the conversion of the 
defense and weapons industry for peaceful purposes, research in 
the military area, and assistance in the case of nuclear 
accidents or calamities. 
  Now all states are in the same position; after this program 
is launched, however, changes will occur, particularly because 
the resources of the participating states are different. 
Partnership means substantial expenses for ensuring the 
compatibility between our own army and NATO's army; this will 
require special financial efforts, especially since we have the 
lowest military budget per capita. Consequently, the economic 
aspect is very important and probably certain facilities will be 
granted in the future; in any case, the military budget has to 
be transparent.

<F P=106> [Press release by Traian Chebeleu, spokesman for Romania's </F>
Presidency, issued in Bucharest on 28 February: "But ROMANIA 
LIBERA Continues To Lie"] 
  [Text] The daily ROMANIA LIBERA on 28 February 1994 
published an article entitled "Accused of Espionage -- a Great 
Dilemma for the Romanian Secret Services; The Key Man Is 
Intelligence General Nikos Grylakis," signed by Sorin Rosca 
Stanescu. 
  Giving absolute credit to the recent accusations made by 
Deputy Traian Basescu [of the Democratic Party (National 
Salvation Front)], which it considers as the pure truth, ROMANIA 
LIBERA -- with a persistence worthy of a better case -- wants to 
involve the presidency and its representatives in the affair of 
the sale of the Romanian fleet [illegally sold to Greek 
businessman Stellos Katounis, owner of the shipping company 
Forum Maritime]. This time, the "cause" is served by Sorin 
Rosca Stanescu, who, probably out of the desire to return to 
ROMANIA LIBERA en-force, only proves that he has not forgotten 
the practices used by the old Securitate, whose reliable 
informer he had been. 
  The article claims that "representatives of the executive 
branch" and the presidential institution have supplied secret 
information regarding the Petromin fleet to Greek intelligence 
General Nikos Grylakis. In this connection, Democratic Party 
Deputy Basescu named two names: Minister of Transport Paul 
Teodoru and Vasile Ionel, President Ion Iliescu's adviser. 
"Until now, the representatives of the government, as well as 
those of the presidential institution, have not officially 
denied anything," the article claims, adding that General 
Grylakis has "influenced President Iliescu's election," for 
which he "received a medal in Bucharest in 1993; Iliescu does 
not deny this." 
  Romanian President Ion Iliescu has often stated his opinion 
on the Petromin-Forum Maritime affair, but to maintain its 
accusations of indifference and silence ROMANIA LIBERA chooses 
to deliberately ignore this thing. We recall that on 24 June 
1993, when he was first time asked about the contract between 
the Petromin and Forum Maritime companies, President Ion Iliescu 
said: "This is not one of my prerogatives; I am not obliged, 
nor do I think it is necessary for me to deal with these 
problems that belong to the national economic sphere. I do not 
have the necessary instruments for that or the necessary 
qualifications. There is no presidential department in charge 
of these matters, which do not fall under the competence of the 
presidential institution. This is a matter to be dealt with by 
the trade companies or public corporations involved in these 
affairs and by the relevant government officials, ministries, 
and economic-financial control bodies. I do not deny that there 
might be suspicions in connection with the seriousness and 
professionalism with which the respective negotiations were 
conducted. All this should be examined." (From the press 
communique of the presidential spokesman No. 164/1993) 
  In the meantime, the Romanian press gave details about the 
Petromin-Forum Maritime affair, so that on 23 July 1993, the 
presidential spokesman summed up President Ion Iliescu's 
viewpoint on this subject in two points: 
  "1. The Petromin-Forum Maritime contract should be examined 
by the bodies set up for this purpose, namely the respective 
parliamentary and government commissions, so that a normal 
contract can be concluded which does not disadvantage the 
Romanian state. 
  "2. The situation of all contracts previously concluded by 
Petromin should be clarified and the results of the enquiry 
should be published, with the relevant bodies being notified if 
needed." 
  ROMANIA LIBERA's claim that General Grylakis "influenced 
President Iliescu's election" is ridiculous, to say the least, 
so it does not deserve any comment. Regarding the alleged medal 
awarded by Romania's president to General Grylakis, Sorin Rosca 
Stanescu should have known that the practice of awarding medals 
was discontinued in our country after the December 1989 
revolution. As a matter of fact, the spokesman mentioned that 
thing on another occasion, in answer to a question about a 
similar allegation made by daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI. (From the 
spokesman's press communique N. 213/1993) 
  Regarding the accusations made by Deputy Traian Basescu, 
according to which General Vasile Ionel would have supplied a 
file with secret data to the Greek general, we reprint here the 
answer given by the presidential adviser to the daily ULTIMUL 
CUVANT on 28 February 1994: "It is the statement of a man who 
does not assume responsibility for what he is saying. I will 
disappoint Mr. Basescu and those inclined to believe him by 
responsibly stating that I do not know what they are talking 
about." A first logical question is why would such a commercial 
transaction -- over the Petromin fleet -- have to involve files 
with secret data and the interference of an official from the 
presidency? 
  Of course, it is easy to realize that there are various 
quarters interested in sowing as much confusion as possible in 
this respect and divert attention from what has to be clarified, 
namely the ways and means through which part of the Petromin 
fleet was sold abroad. 
  Romania's president considers that the legal system is the 
only one capable of ascertaining the truth of these accusations; 
consequently, he hopes that the legal bodies will shed some 
light on what is called "the Petromin affair." Any rumors or 
"information" deliberately launched in this connection can only 
encumber the normal proceedings of the inquiry -- the press 
communique released by the spokesman of the Romanian presidency 
concludes.

  [Excerpts] Vienna, March 4 (AFP) -- Bosnian Croats and 
Moslems met here Friday to hammer out the details of a 
U.S.-sponsored federation agreement, as UN troops prepared to 
patrol the front lines between the two communities. 
Participants said the talks, which began at the U.S. Embassy, 
will aim for concrete results by March 15. 
  The U.S. special envoy for former Yugoslavia, Charles 
Redman, 
said he was optimistic. "We will have serious work and serious 
talks," he commented before the start of negotiations. 
  The Moslem-led Bosnian Government is being represented by 
Justice Minister Kasem Trnka. The Croats are represented by 
Croatia's deputy foreign minister Ivo Sanader and Bosnian Croat 
leader Kresimir Subak. [passage omitted] 
  Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic told journalists 
Friday 
he would probably go to Vienna this weekend to take part in the 
talks. He planned to continue to Moscow Wednesday to meet his 
Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev, in a bid to secure Serb 
participation in the project. 
  "Russia can play a positive role" in exerting its influence 
on the Serbs, Granic told journalists during a visit to the 
northern Italian city of Trieste, where he was taking part in a 
meeting of Central European foreign ministers. 
  The main job for the Vienna talks, according to diplomatic 
sources, is to work out the details of a constitution inspired 
by the Swiss model of autonomous cantons. There could be three 
cantons, the sources said; one Croat unit grouping the present 
self-proclaimed Bosnian Croat republic and two Moslem units in 
central Bosnia. The central government would have limited 
powers, taking charge of foreign affairs, defense and trade. 
Each side would take turns in holding the presidency and would 
hold a balance of power in the parliament. 
  The talks should also lay the basis for a long-term military 
agreement between Croat and Moslem forces, following a ceasefire 
which began last Friday. 
  In Sarajevo on Friday, UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
spokesman Major Rob Annink said the two sides had given the 
green light for UN troops to patrol frontlines as early as 
Saturday, to be accompanied by unarmed Croats and Moslems. 
Talks will also begin on opening up six routes across 
frontlines. 
  UN peacekeepers will be deployed immediately at the 
Croat-Moslem hot spots of Mostar, Vitez, Gorni Vakuf, Prozor, 
Konjic, and Jablanica where ceasefire violations have been 
rampant, said UNPROFOR spokesman Major Guy Vinet. 
  Bosnian Army leaders and the United Nations have also warned 
that more international troops were needed to enforce the 
ceasefire. Brigadier-General Fikret Muslimovic of the Bosnian 
Army, speaking from Zenica in central Bosnia, said the UNPROFOR 
force was not large enough to keep the peace between Moslems and 
Croats, who are confronting each other over large tracts of 
territory. "It won't be possible," he said, "if more troops do 
not come." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Let us hear what the leader of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation, Justice Minister Kasim Trnka, has 
to say about the current talks and their continuation: 
  [Begin Trnka recording] As our public already knows, a 
preliminary agreement was concluded in Washington regarding a 
federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina for Bosnia-Herzegovina to 
transform its internal constitutional system. The federation 
would for the time being encompass predominantly Croat and 
Bosnian-populated areas, while Serb controlled areas would have 
the opportunity to either join the federation or join the peace 
process and find appropriate solutions, through which the 
territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina is always emphasized. 
  The essence lies in the fact that the constitutional system 
should be transformed into a new form of a cantonal type, in 
which federal units would be cantons and would be set up 
exclusively on an ethnic basis. This national element was taken 
into consideration. The essence lies in the fact that a number 
of cantons should be set up in which important state competences 
would be discharged. The central government would have much 
wider competences than envisaged by the Vance-Owen and the 
Owen-Stoltenberg plans. The central government's competences 
include the Armed Forces, foreign affairs, issues related to the 
monetary system, the economic market, the free flow of goods and 
capital, issues concerning citizenship, managing resources, and 
so on. This is a wide range of competences. 
  The second range of competences would be realized through 
the 
cooperation between the central authorities and the cantonal 
authorities; it would include an infrastructure shared by 
several cantons and cooperation in a series of other fields. 
  On the cantonal level, state bodies would be set up: from 
the 
assembly to the executive bodies and judiciary. Cantonal 
competences would cover everything that has not been enumerated 
on the level of central authorities and central-cantonal 
cooperation. 
  Within each canton there would be municipalities; they would 
have their local self-administration. A special arrangement has 
been agreed upon in this regard: Municipalities where the 
majority population is not the majority population of the canton 
would have a special status, a much higher degree of autonomy 
than other municipalities within the same canton. 
  The intention of the council here is to work further on the 
principles laid down in the Washington agreement, initially 
referring to the constitution of the federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. An eventual agreement on the confederation 
with the Republic of Croatia should also be prepared, and then 
military experts should work on military arrangements and other 
measures should be examined with Croatia for the new 
constitutional order. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Vienna, March 6 (AFP) -- The head of the Bosnian 
Croat delegation at talks here on details of a future 
Croat-Moslem federation said Sunday [6 March] he was optimistic 
they would be concluded by the March 15 deadline for signing a 
final agreement in Washington. Talks began here Friday after 
the Bosnian Croats and mainly-Moslem Bosnian government signed 
an initial agreement there last Tuesday to form a federation. 
  Delegation leader Ivo Sanader, Croatia's deputy foreign 
minister, said it was "difficult to say" when the new federation 
would actually be set up, but "the most important thing is that 
we have to find a solution which can satisfy the new federation 
and the Republic of Croatia. All of us are ready to do this." 
  Bosnian Justice Minister and delegation head Kasem Trnka and 
Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak however refused to comment 
on the negotiations, saying it was "too early." 
  One of the most difficult issues at the talks, held at the 
U.S. Embassy here, is how to carve up the cantons which will 
form the Swiss-style federation. The U.S.-sponsored plan, 
agreed in principle by Croat and Moslem leaders, aims to 
establish a federation inside Bosnia-Herzegovina made up of 
autonomous Moslem and Croat cantons. This would later form a 
looser, mainly economic confederation with neighbouring Croatia. 
The Serbs would be encouraged to accept a two-way division of 
the territory with the federation existing alongside their own 
Bosnian Serb republic. 
  U.S. officials here said Saturday they would attempt to 
persuade Bosnian Serbs to back plans for the Croat-Moslem 
federation. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] A transitional committee made up of delegations 
of the Republic of Croatia and Muslims and Croats from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina continued its work today at the U.S. Embassy 
in Vienna. Ivo Sanader, Croatian deputy minister of foreign 
affairs, has spoken to our reporter Sandra Posum Djurin. This 
is how Deputy Minister Sanader views the transitional 
committee's work: 
  [Begin Sanader recording] I would describe our work so far 
as 
good. We are making progress. For the time being there are no 
major problems. There is a fair deal of adjusting positions. 
It is perhaps interesting to mention that at the moment we are 
working on the first item, the first set of issues, namely the 
constitution of the future federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
between Croats and Bosniak Muslims. I believe that today or 
tomorrow, perhaps tomorrow, we may finalize a draft constitution. 
  Afterward, the preliminary confederation agreement follows 
between the federation and the Republic of Croatia. This is 
then followed by a military agreement on military organization 
within the federation. 
  The fourth item includes transitional measures for speeding 
up the founding of the federation and the confederation; 
wherever it is possible, this will include state organization as 
well. 
  These are the three sets of issues that remain to be 
resolved 
once we have finished working on the federation constitution. 
You know that for our part we have decided -- these have always 
been our propositions -- that the Muslims and Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina should seek reconciliation, that an end 
should be put to all their conflicts. 
  We find continuity in our policy along these lines. The fact 
that the world's greatest democratic power has become heavily 
involved in these talks testifies in practical terms to the fact 
that we have always followed the right and correct path. Now 
this transitional committee of ours is tasked with a very 
difficult and responsible duty, I would even say an historic 
task, of outlining what Minister Granic, Prime Minister 
Silajdzic, and President of Herceg-Bosna Zubak signed in 
Washington in the presence of U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher in such a way as to make both sides satisfied, first 
in the federation, and to find a mutual interest in the future 
confederation. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F>
Christoph Bertram; place and date not given: "It Is a Tightrope 
Walk"] 
  [Text] [Bertram] Mr. Woerner, you have always advocated 
determined action by the West in the Balkans. Does the recent 
measure correspond to your ideas of energetic action? 
  [Woerner] It is a first and, as I believe, very useful step, 
which, however, must be followed by others. Military action is 
not a purpose in itself. The goal must remain, and that is 
improving the safety of the people -- in all parts of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- and contributing to a peaceful agreement 
among the parties. 
  [Bertram] The military intervention by NATO may have started 
some movement in this respect. Do you think that further 
military steps by the West are necessary? 
  [Woerner] For me, it is not military steps that are in the 
foreground but the political efforts -- and at all levels: at 
the level of the United Nations, then at the level of the two 
big powers United States and Russia, but also at the level of 
the NATO members. These political steps will, however, be 
successful only if they continue to be accompanied by the 
determination of taking military measures when necessary and 
wherever nothing else helps. In this respect, our primary 
concern in NATO is that we do not gamble away the reputation we 
have gained by precipitate and insufficiently planned 
operations. We are engaged in some sort of tightrope walk here. 
  On the one hand, the stimulus must not be lost. We must use 
it. What we have done in Sarajevo must not remain a unique 
operation. On the other hand, what is done now must be planned 
just as thoroughly and must then be implemented with equal 
determination -- perhaps with different methods. 
  [Bertram] Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, is 
calling for more ground forces. He needs an additional 
3,000-5,000 blue helmets just to stabilize the situation in and 
around Sarajevo. What are the prospects of getting these 
3,000-5,000 men from the NATO countries? 
  [Woerner] I fully sympathize with General Rose and he has my 
support -- first, for the determined way in which he is acting 
and second, for his demand for more troops. However, I do not 
see where they are supposed to come from at the moment. I get 
the impression that our member countries, which are already 
providing the majority of troops there, are very restrained in 
this respect. 
  [Bertram] If there is something like a private opinion of 
the secretary general, who is German: Are you convinced of 
Boon's arguments that German soldiers must not or should not get 
more actively involved in peacekeeping in Bosnia? 
  [Woerner] My personal opinion: Most of these arguments have 
not convinced me. I have never considered the constitutional 
argument correct, and the other arguments must be weighed 
carefully. However, I would be very restrained about using 
German ground forces in areas where German troops operated in 
World War II. This applies in particular to the areas where we 
are dealing with Serbs. This is a necessary consideration. 
  [Bertram] There are also other possibilities.... 
  [Woerner] There are other possibilities, in which I would 
recommend to be more generous. 
  [Bertram] If the West does not send any more troops, will 
then Russia not be virtually invited to jump into the breach? 
How do you assess Russia's role in this conflict? 
  [Woerner] One will be able to come to a final assessment of 
Russia's role only when it is clear how the Russians themselves 
define their role. I hope very much that they do not understand 
themselves as the Serbs' protective power but as a power that is 
trying to tackle the problem impartially. 
  [Bertram] Do you welcome the presence of Russian troops in 
Bosnia? 
  [Woerner] When some people complain today that Russia is 
becoming active there, I do not share this view at all. First, 
I think it is unavoidable. Second, I even think it is helpful 
since it has been done with the intention of making the Serbs 
give in. I believe that we have to include the Russians in such 
a way that they continue to use their influence in the spirit of 
a solution that is acceptable for all parties. 
  [Bertram] And what if they do not let themselves be 
included? Does Moscow then have a veto right? 
  [Woerner] It is out of the question that Russia is going to 
gain a certain influence on the actions of NATO. We have done 
what we considered appropriate and correct, following a decision 
by all our member states, and we will continue to do so. We are 
ready and interested in cooperating with the Russians and also 
in consulting them. However, the Russians are not a member of 
NATO. And just as Russia has interests, this also applies to 
NATO. One must not confuse Russia's welcome role as a 
participating big power with a right to veto NATO actions. 
  [Bertram] The West has for a long time hesitated about 
getting militarily involved in the Balkans. Is NATO now 
irrevocably involved -- after the ultimatum and after the 
enforcement of the flight ban? 
  [Woerner] I think so. This was unavoidable anyway; this 
just had to come. This is also part of NATO's tasks in our 
time. We are the only functioning collective defense alliance 
in the world. We are the central factor of stability for all of 
Europe. One cannot just claim this role, but one must make a 
specific contribution in situations of crisis. We have done 
this and we will continue to do so. 
  [Bertram] Do you sometimes ask -- perhaps with a bit of 
bitterness -- why action was taken only now? What could have 
been avoided if action had been taken earlier? 
  [Woerner] Here I once again answer as Manfred Woerner and 
not as secretary general. I do indeed ask myself this question 
-- more and more every day. My own conviction was and is: 
Timely intervention would very probably have prevented an 
expansion of the conflict and would have facilitated a political 
solution. At least, now we have taken determined action.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Bosko Santic] </F>
  [Text] It is not enough to the Americans that they have 
punished the Muslims and the Croats in the most brutal way 
possible; they have now even started to mock them. How should 
one otherwise interpret the words of Warren Christopher that the 
agreement in the State Department shows how much can be 
achieved, after bitter years of violence, when two sides sit 
behind a negotiating table and decide to reach an agreement. By 
running after the carrot, the leaders of the two peoples 
deserved to get the stick, which they did, and any sort of 
submissiveness ultimately deserves to be despised. However, it 
nevertheless seems that the things have been pushed too far, be 
it in the demonstration of power and in the manifestation of 
weakness. The two peoples that have been bleeding and dying did 
not deserve this, irrespective of their leaders. 
  It would certainly be better for the Croats to have 
sanctions 
imposed against them, and for the Muslims to be told once and 
for all not to expect a single cent or bullet in aid, than to 
sign an agreement to live together again. Had the Americans 
really wanted peace, they would have condemned Granic, 
Silajdzic, and Zubak to share the same bachelor pad until the 
end of their lives, and build a China wall between the two 
peoples. 
  Parallel to the realization of their political interests, 
the 
Americans also love to amuse themselves in the Bosnian arena and 
that is why they are offering new bloodshed in the name of 
peace. Just like a chess player after a lost match who is 
analyzing the positions and wondering where he went wrong, 
placing the figures on the same positions again, and demanding 
an impossible victory, the Americans are again trying out an 
option that has already flopped -- a coalition of the Croats and 
the Muslims. However, it is incomparably more difficult on this 
occasion as, in the meantime, much blood has been shed and the 
hatred is enormous. 
  Forgetting that love cannot be administered or agreed on, as 
opposed to hatred, which can be instigated, the Americans would 
now like to mix up the Mostar Croats and Muslims just like chess 
pieces on the board, exorcising memories, pain, and despair from 
their heads and souls. Forget everything and love each other, 
the Americans advise them and those in central Bosnia -- the 
exiled, the displaced, and the mutilated. They should all 
forget everything. It is not theirs to think and feel, as pawns 
do not feel. There are no more grenades, but the most dangerous 
weapon -- the door. This is the most poisonous weapon -- when, 
at midnight or at four o'clock in the morning, uniformed people 
come to the door and beat, tie-up, kill, and chase people away. 
This weapon is also dangerous for the nervous system and is 
used only when people live together. There will be no more of 
this, love each other, the Americans recommend. 
  We should not worry. Live people are not pawns. There have 
been rumors that, even after the signing of the agreement, the 
clashes will not stop. Because of the fear of doors, the 
grenade is being used as a weapon.

  [Text] Budapest, March 6 (TANJUG)--Although agreements 
conducive to peace should be welcomed, the recently signed 
agreement on a Croat-Muslim federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina has 
parts which indicate that what is actually involved is the 
creation of a military bloc against the Bosnian Serbs, Army of 
Yugoslavia (V.J.) spokesman, Col. Ljubodrag Stojadinovic warned 
on Sunday. 
  Col. Stojadinovic said on a Hungarian radio programme that 
the Bosnian Serbs had no reason why to join the "inconceivable 
Croat-Muslim federation," which the V.J. spokesman said would 
not last long. 
  Col. Stojadinovic said that the setting up of the federation 
would mark a step backwards, that is, a return to how things 
were when war broke out in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The war broke out in 1992 after the Muslim-Croat coalition 
took a decision on the forcible secession of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
from the then Yugoslav Federation against the wishes of the 
Bosnian Serbs and contrary to the republican Constitution which 
specified that all vital decisions required the consensus of all 
three peoples in the republic. 
  The Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina proclaimed the Serb Republic 
(R.S.) in 1992 on their historical and ethnic territories. 
  Col. Stojadinovic said that it was the duty of the V.J. to 
defend the territory and air space of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia and, at the same time, carefully to follow what was 
taking place in the immediate neighbourhood, particularly where 
the Serb people lives. 
  The spokesman said that the V.J. expected the crisis in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina to be resolved peacefully, but was ready for 
the worst, although it felt that the R.S. and neighbouring 
republic of Serb Krajina (RSK), the Serb state within the 
administrative boundaries of the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Croatia, could alone defend themselves. 
  Col. Stojadinovic repeated the official V.J. statement that 
the four planes downed over Bosnia-Herzegovina early in the week 
were not part of its air force and that no V.J. pilots were at 
the time in the area where NATO fighter-bombers had taken action. 
  The incident is quite mysterious, since it occurred in an 
area where the Bosnia Muslims and Croats are engaged in mutual 
fighting, Col. Stojadinovic said. He said that NATO 
representatives should provide the answer to the question whose 
the downed planes were. 
  Col. Stojadinovic said there would be no danger if the 
airfield near Tuzla, in north-eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, was to 
be used strictly for humanitarian purposes, but specified that 
there would be a real danger if the airfield was to be opened by 
force. 
  The Bosnian Serbs and Russia reached an agreement in the 
middle of the week for Russian observers to check all deliveries 
arriving at the Muslim-held airfield near Tuzla. 
  The Serb side has insisted on the control of the air 
deliveries out of fear that the airfield could be used for 
illegal munitions shipments to the Bosnian Muslims.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 6 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Army expert 
for special forces, retired Colonel Stojan Jovic, has told 
TANJUG that none of the big powers miss an opportunity to test 
their special units under actual war conditions. He said this 
in reaction to a recent report that 60 British Special Air 
Service (SAS) troops were infiltrated into the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In Jovic's opinion, the SAS troops have been in Bosnia since 
the beginning of the conflict, some have even been captured in 
actions, but they posed as mercenaries. Jovic, a commander of 
the parachute brigade for many years, said on the basis of his 
long experience, that the operations preceding the 
disintegration of former Yugoslavia as well as those taking 
place today in the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, can be 
termed special war or a low-intensity conflict. 
  The special war doctrine originated in the U.S. in the 1960s 
on the basis of its experience in the local wars in Korea and 
Vietnam and the conclusion that the next war would not be a 
global conflict of opposing blocs but an endless series of 
limited clashes and special operations which would require 
special units. All the developments in the territory of former 
Yugoslavia in recent years fully fit in with the special war 
doctrine, Jovic said. 
  The generally known special units are the British SAS, the 
American Green Berets and Rangers, the Russian Spetznaz and 
others. 
  British SAS units continue the tradition of British units 
from the World War Two and subsequent local wars, and they use 
their ample experience to perfect their training and operations. 
  The present U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) commander in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina, General Michael Rose, used to be an SAS 
commander and participated in operations in the Falklands. Gen. 
Rose has been known to Yugoslav experts because he lectured at 
the Belgrade Military School in 1983. 
  Other countries were also preraring for operations in 
Yugoslav territory, Jovic said. For instance, there was a unit 
within the first batallion of the 10th group of the Green Berets 
located in Bad Tolz in Germany, which was trained for operations 
in Yugoslav territory even some 20 years ago. The unit included 
Yugoslav emigres. There is numerous evidence that the troops of 
this American special unit are now in Bosnia. Some have been 
captured, and former UNPROFOR commander for ex-Yugoslavia 
Philippe Morillon confirmed their presence in Srebrenica. 
  Jovic said that some operations in Bosnia can come under the 
heading of "dirty tricks" stipulated in the American special war 
rules. To illustrate this, he mentioned the alleged shelling of 
the presidential office in Zagreb, the massacres in Sarajevo's 
Vase Miskina street and in the Markale market, the fabrication 
of Serb death camps and massive rapes of Moslem women. 
  There is no proof for the presence of special units of other 
countries in the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it is 
obvious that these countries have taken part in training troops 
of the breakaway republics, Jovic said, mentioning the training 
of Slovene territorial defence officers in Germany and special 
Bosnian Moslem police units in Libya. 
  The army of the Bosnian Serb republic, the Serb state in 
Bosnia, also has special sabotage and reconnaisance units, storm 
troops and anti-terrorist units. Their training and combat 
experience is evident from the daily reports on routing of enemy 
sabotage groups in the Bosnian Serb territory, Jovic said.

  [Text] Podgorica, Yugoslavia, March 6 (TANJUG) -- 
Montenegro's ruling Democratic Party of Socialists ended its 
second congress in the capital Podgorica late on Sunday. 
  The congress re-elected Montenegrin President Momir 
Bulatovic 
as president of the party. Closing the two-day gathering of 218 
delegates, Bulatovic emphasised the importance of cherishing and 
promoting the state of Montenegro which, together with Serbia, 
forms Yugoslavia, and said that nobody had the right to break 
these states. It is not in Montenegro's interest to form a 
state only with Serbia, "our vital interests lie also in the 
direction of Herzegovina, and we have close historical and 
economic ties also with the Bosnian Serb republic and the 
Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.)" said Bulatovic. 
  The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 by the local Serbs in 
those 
parts within the arbitrary communist-era borders of Croatia 
where they are the majority population, in response to Croatia's 
violent secession from former Yugoslavia and trampling on their 
rights. 
  In 1992, local Serbs in the breakaway Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, too, formed their Bosnian Serb republic in 
their ancestral ethnic lands. 
  Bulatovic said that Montenegro was supporting and would 
continue to do so the struggle of the Serb people outside 
Yugoslavia for freedom, dignity and equality, but added that it 
would continue to oppose "the extreme nationalism which has 
grown root under the influence of civil war, radically 
confronted ideologies and narrow national interests." 
  He stressed that Moslems in Montenegro must by no means be 
equated with the militant fundamentalists in the Bosnian Moslem 
leadership, and that the Albanians who advocate secessionism and 
violent methods of its achievement were few in the republic. 
  Bulatovic said that there must be no animosity towards 
Croats 
in Montenegro, because "we have never waged war on the Croatian 
people, but on the proponents of the extremist greater-national 
ideology" in Croatia. 
  He said that Montenegro had been the first to "suggest to a 
wondering Europe the idea of a normalisation of relations among 
the former Yugoslav republics," and that Montenegro "has no 
reason for a confrontation with, for instance, Macedonia or 
Slovenia."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Press Conference of President Rugova </F>
in Prishtina" -- issued by the Democratic League of Kosovo] 
  [Text] Repression continued this week. Raids, arrests, 
and ill-treatment in the municipalities of Peja, Gjilan, 
Suhareka, Prizren, Junik, Klina, Vitia, etc. have been 
continuing unabated, said President Rugova, speaking at a press 
conference today in Prishtina. Raids under the pretext of arms 
searches are usually followed by demolition of property, Dr. 
Rugova added. "The killing of Selman Daci in the vicinity of 
the Macedonia-Kosova border- crossing point is a bad omen," said 
President Rugova adding that the border with Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], "which is 
illegal for us," began a toll of its first victim. The week 
behind us was characterized by heavy movements of Serbian army 
and their build up in different areas such as in the bordering 
stripe Gjakova-Prizren, in the vicinity of Kacanik, around 
Podujeva, Kamaran, and other places, Dr. Rugova said. "Taking 
into account what happened in Bosnia we consider this as a new 
threat. We have warned that such Serbian military movements 
represent further provocation toward the Kosovo people," 
President Rugova said. 
  "Following the Serbian takeover of the building of the 
Kosova's Academy of Arts and Sciences, the building of the 
Institute of Albanian Studies is threatened with a similar 
takeover. This is the only and last institution bearing the 
symbolic relevance for the Albanians," President Rugova told 
journalists adding that "once again we warn the Serbian regime, 
the local Serbian-installed authorities in Kosova to seriously 
think on what they have been doing." 
  Commenting on the NATO actions in Bosnia, Dr. Rugova hailed 
the NATO intervention in compliance with the UN Security Council 
resolution on the non-flying zone over Bosnia. He also hailed 
the Croat-Muslim agreement signed in Washington hoping for its 
implementation. "We hail the statement of the U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher who said that all the problems in 
former Yugoslavia will be solved by the United States in 
cooperation with the European Union, and Russia. We think that 
such an approach is very encouraging for Kosova, too," he said. 
  Asked whether Albania and the international community would 
intervene in order to stop Serbian violence in Kosova, President 
Rugova said: "We have been calling for preventive steps toward 
Kosova. Albania is interested to prevent any conflict. The 
awareness that if something happens in Kosova would be 
catastrophe for the entire region is very intense in the 
international fora. Therefore, everybody is interested to 
prevent such developments, and I hope that our demand for 
placing Kosova under a UN protectorate will be accepted." 
  Asked to comment on the threats of his arrest issued in the 
Serbian press recently, Dr. Rugova said he had no wish to 
comment on them. Instead, he commented on the total 
unwillingness of the Serbian side to accept dialogue with the 
Albanians, stressing that the Albanian side is open and ready to 
engage in a serious dialogue over Kosova.

  [Text] President of the Republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim 
Rugova held a news conference in Prishtina today. Asked about 
the Serbian mass media threats to arrest him, Rugova answered: 
I carry out my job and I am here. For more details, let us 
follow reporter Sherif Konjufca: 
  [Konjufca] The raids and arrests of Albanian citizens by the 
Serbian police are being accompanied with the brutal demolition 
of houses and the destruction of their properties. 
  Mr. Rugova said that, during last week, Selman Daci was 
killed at the Hani i Elezit border point for no reason. The 
trumped-up trials against Albanians continued in Peje and other 
cities in Kosova. On the other hand, movements of the Serbian 
Army have been observed in many areas in Kosova, particularly at 
the border area with Albania. Police formations are continuing 
to be stationed in many areas, such as in the factory of [word 
indistinct] near Kacanik, the Prishtina-Podujeve road, Komoran, 
and other localities. 
  After the closure of the academy, the Serbian authorities 
have decided to close the Albanological Institute, which is an 
institution that bears a symbol of the national identity of 
Albanians. Unlike the first closure of the institute in 1957, 
this time the institute will continue its work just like the 
other scientific, cultural, and state institutions in Kosova, 
despite whatever will happen with its building. 
  Mr. Rugova said that we, once again, warn the Serbian regime 
and its exponents installed in Kosova of the consequences of all 
these provocations against the Albanian population in Kosova. 
  On this occasion, Mr. Rugova greeted NATO's intervention in 
the Bosnian sky, the Bosnian-Croat agreement, and the statement 
by U.S. Secretary of State Christopher that all the problems in 
the former Yugoslavia will be resolved by the United States and 
Europe without bloodshed. This gives us hope that the problem 
of Kosova, too, will be solved by placing its territory under UN 
protection. 
  Answering a question about the possibility of intervention 
by 
an external factor, particularly Albania, in the case of war or 
a Serbian massacre in Kosova, President Rugova answered: We 
have worked to avoid conflict in Kosova. However, Albania, which 
is concerned about the fate of its fellow nationals in Kosova, 
is also not interested in a conflict. Today, the whole world 
knows the catastrophic consequences that such a conflict may 
bring to the whole region. 
  Regarding a journalist's appeal to comment on the threats of 
the press and several Serbian party leaders to havre him 
arrested, Mr. Rugova answered briefly: We are all threatened, 
but I carry out my job and I am here. 
  Meanwhile, responding to the possibility of Albanian-Serbian 
dialogue, Mr. Rugova said: We have said that we favor dialogue, 
but the Serbian side does not give such signs. First, 
repression should be stopped and an appropriate atmosphere for 
talks be created. The talks should be held in the presence of 
an international mediator. For the moment, the Serbian regime 
has erected a mental blockade and cannot find courage to do 
that, Mr. Rugova said at the end of his meeting with reporters.

<F P=106> [Article by Milos Antic: "Lasso in the Hands of Indecisive </F>
Authorities"] 
  [Text] The question whether Ibrahim Rugova -- the 
president of the so-called republic of Kosovo, the chairman of 
the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo, and the chairman of two 
coordination committees of Albanian political parties from 
Kosovo and other territories of the former Yugoslavia -- will be 
arrested is becoming increasingly interesting in Kosovo. 
  Not so much because the Party of Serbian Unity promised on 
two occasions that Rugova "would be arrested," or "that the 
Party of Serbian Unity would find ways and means to bring Rugova 
to court if the present political leadership of the country did 
not do so," but because 11 members of his Defense Ministry have 
already been arrested. Rugova established an army of 40,000 
soldiers, armed it, and prepared it for "the liberation of the 
republic of Kosova." 
  There have been rumors about his detention since the time 
when he became chairman of the Albanian movement for the 
"republic of Kosovo." It is claimed, however, that the Serbian 
leadership opposed his detention as long as his activity was 
only verbal. The leadership tolerated his activities as long as 
he founded ministries of education, health, culture, sports, and 
such, which were not considered dangerous, but after it became 
known that he had also established a defense ministry that 
worked on establishing an army, things changed. 
  The name Ibrahim Rugova is not mentioned in the indictment 
against the 11 members of the Defense Ministry. Anton Koljaj, 
his deputy, who is now on the run, is charged with the 
establishment of the ministry, but it is stated that it was 
established according to the instructions of the Democratic 
Alliance of Kosovo. 
  The attorney general was asked by journalists whether Rugova 
would also be arrested, and he answered that "the authorities in 
charge were doing their job, that they were collecting facts and 
that only those people whom it was proved that they were engaged 
in illegal activities would be charged." Rugova can still 
perform his political activities freely, he is still receiving 
foreign delegations and is going on visits abroad, where he can 
meet Bujar Bukoshi, the prime minister in exile, and try to 
achieve recognition of the "republic of Kosovo." He also wants 
Kosovo to become an international protectorate, as a 
transitional period for secession from Serbia and the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  Whether Rugova will be arrested depends on the outcome of 
the 
trial against the 11 members of the Defense Ministry, which is 
still not known. Apart from that, everybody knows that the 
Albanian police exist, but proof has to be found. It would also 
be enough to arrest Rugova. 
  There is another aspect of the "Rugova case." It is believed 
that there is more than enough proof for his detention, but "the 
present authorities must not do it because of the international 
community." Rugova has the image of a democrat and a man 
fighting for his aims with political means, so that his 
detention would upset the international community and affect the 
already unfavorable position of Serbia. 
  Some people even think that the detention of Rugova's 
assistants and followers who were arrested for arms smuggling 
has the goal of making Rugova flee abroad, so that the present 
authorities do not have to arrest him. This would also have an 
additional effect. The Democratic Alliance of Kosovo would be 
dissolved, which would weaken the Albanian movement. 
  The recent detentions of the illegal defense ministry 
members 
and the undermining of weapons supplies made it clear that 
illegal Albanian institutions would be treated more severely. 
It remains to be seen who has better nerves, the present 
Serbian leadership in tolerating Rugova's activities, or Rugova, 
who relies on international support and "indecisive Serbian 
authorities." When asked several days ago to comment on the 
announcement of his detention, Rugova answered: "I am here, 
they may come." This statement was interpreted as a provocation 
of the Serbian authorities, because Rugova pretended that he 
wanted to be arrested and tried, since this would make him "a 
living martyr."

  [Text] The second election assembly of the Democratic 
Alliance of Vojvodina Croats [Demokratska Zajednica 
Vojvodjanskih Hrvata -- DZVH] was held in Subotica this 
afternoon. Bela Tonkovic was reelected the party president with 
a majority of votes. Zvonimir Nesic from Petrovaradin, and 
Stanka Kujundzic and Lazo Vojnic-Hajduk from Subotica were 
elected deputy presidents. 
  The DZVH will continue its struggle for cultural autonomy 
through democratic means, and not only for the cultural autonomy 
of Vojvodina Croats, but also for all members of the Croat 
people who live in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, it was 
concluded today at the assembly of Vojvodina Croats. The main 
objective is to stay and survive in the areas where the Croats 
have lived for centuries. 
  With the reelection of Bela Tonkovic as the party president, 
the DZVH assembly opted for continuity in its work. The DZVH 
has established itself at home and abroad as the only legitimate 
representative of the Croat people in Serbia, so sooner or later 
even Belgrade will have to accept it as a partner in talks, it 
was said at today's assembly in Subotica. 
  In his acceptance address, Bela Tonkovic called on all 
Croats 
who live between Subotica and Boka Kotorska to unite even more 
than before in order to join forces in their struggle for human 
and national rights which belong to them by all international 
norms. 
  Other members of the presidency and council of the DZVH were 
also elected today.

  [Text] [Announcer] The Russian Foreign Ministry has 
protested against statements made recently by Lech Walesa 
regarding the excessive concentration of Russian troops in the 
Kaliningrad area. 
  The Ministry's representative, Mikhail Demurin, declared 
that 
what the Polish president had said during his visit to Latvia 
was not conducive to stability in the Baltic region and was an 
affront to the spirit of Polish-Russian agreements. 
  On 24 February, during an official visit to Latvia, 
President 
Lech Walesa said that the excessive concentration of Russian 
troops in the Kaliningrad district was not beneficial to 
security in the Baltic region. 
  [Reporter] The Kaliningrad district belongs to Russia, and 
everything that happens there is an internal matter for the 
Russian Federation, said Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Krylov, 
commenting on Lech Walesa's statement. 
  The spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Mikhail 
Demurin, added that Russia had the right to keep within the 
Kaliningrad district as many troops as was necessary to ensure 
security. According to Deputy Minister Krylov, President Walesa 
is well aware that many Russian soldiers are in the district 
temporarily. This situation arose when troops were withdrawn 
from the Baltic countries, and it was impossible to relocate 
them in other regions of the country. 
  The Russian diplomat believes that by his statement Lech 
Walesa wanted to please the Latvians. According to experts, 
there are at present 150,000-200,000 Russian soldiers stationed 
in the Kaliningrad district.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev by </F>
Maria Graczyk in Krakow on 23 February: "Miracles of Diplomacy"] 
  [Text] [Graczyk] The declaration signed by the presidents 
of Poland and Russia in Warsaw says that Poland's membership in 
NATO is a question of a sovereign decision by Poland itself. 
Yet a few weeks later, Boris Yeltsin sent a surprise letter to 
Western leaders, calling on them not to expand NATO. Why was 
the Russian president's behavior not consistent with the 
declaration? 
  [Kozyrev] Maybe because he did not read the declaration very 
carefully. We diplomats are accustomed to studying every single 
document with painstaking care, but nondiplomats tend to skim 
them. The things we are saying today are contained in the 
Russo-Polish declaration. In conformity with the CSCE, we 
believe that any decisions reached by Poland are an expression 
of that country's freedom of choice. The Polish state defines 
its own needs and expectations, and takes sovereign steps in 
this or that sphere. It also decides whether to take part in 
the work of various international organizations. 
  However, the declaration says nothing about Russia, an 
independent state just like Poland, not having the right to 
present its own ideas, especially on how fast the European 
security system is to be established. Just as we believe Poland 
may decide freely on whether to join NATO, we believe that there 
is no point in hurrying to join NATO. There is nothing 
inconsistent about that. 
  [Graczyk] In that case, what do you mean by the expression 
"Russia's special interests in this part of Europe"? 
  [Kozyrev] The Russians and Poles have historical links. We 
share a border in the Kaliningrad Oblast, and we both belong to 
the Baltic Cooperation Council. The very creation of this 
council is proof that both countries share common interests. 
One reason for this, of course, is that both of our countries 
border on the Baltic Sea, to say nothing of our cultures and 
economic relations. 
  Minister Olechowski presented me with a Russo-Polish 
economic 
cooperation program. That is also evidence of special ties 
between our countries, stemming from a desire to develop 
cooperation in particular spheres. But that does not mean that 
we have imperialist longings or a desire to dominate others or 
indulge in diktat, and I am sure Poland does not want to dictate 
an economic policy to us. It would not be fair to interpret 
Minister Olechowski's speech in such a way, even though he did 
mention a special interest in cooperating with Russia. By the 
way, Russia's "special interests" do not apply only to Europe. 
They also apply to other parts of the world--for example, 
Mexico. 
  [Graczyk] Poland is also interested in other eastern 
neighbors, including Ukraine and Belarus. How do you assess 
Polish diplomatic moves in this region? 
  [Kozyrev] As a great power, we value ourselves too highly to 
develop an inferiority complex. On the other hand, we respect 
democratic Poland too much to detect any Polish neoimperialism 
in such positive aims as economic development or political and 
cultural cooperation with CIS countries. Although I myself am 
sometimes accused of harboring neoimperial tendencies, I cannot 
say the same about my Polish friend and colleague. 
  [Graczyk] Differences of opinion between Poland and Russia 
on security in this part of Europe are well known. Both you and 
Minister Olechowski have declared a rapprochement of views since 
the Krakow meeting. 
  [Kozyrev] Our perspectives are undergoing constant 
modification. It would be naive to think that, with the speed of 
change today, the declarations of any one politician will 
continue to be valid in 10 years' time. That would be a miracle 
of diplomacy. Therefore, every hard-pressed diplomat reacts to 
his surroundings, shifting the balance in his views and 
adjusting his stance. 
  Minister Olechowski and I are keeping a close eye on what is 
happening around us. We also listen to each other and take each 
other's views into consideration--hence, certain nuances and 
changes of opinion. But, basically, we agree that a common 
Europe has to be built together by means of dialogue. But one 
should not make hasty and unpremeditated decisions that could 
turn out to be inconvenient for one side or the other. We must 
all continue to work on this. One cannot expect miracles in 
diplomacy.

  [Text] Warsaw, 5 Mar--Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland 
Gennadiy Udovenko announced at a news conference today that 
there would be an appeal to the Supreme Court against the 
verdict on Ukrainian Security Service Major Anatoliy Lysenko, 
accused of spying for Ukraine. 
  In the ambassador's view, the verdict of the court is unjust 
because neither Lysenko nor the Ukrainian Security Service 
carried on spying activity to the detriment of Poland. He 
treats the detention of Lysenko as "the activity of influential 
circles that are acting against the reconciliation of the two 
states." The ambassador expects that "in democratic Poland, 
justice will prevail." 
  Udovenko revealed that the Ukrainian embassy had held secret 
talks on the Lysenko case with 15 influential personalities in 
Polish political life. The Ukrainian side was concerned that 
the case did not worsen mutual contacts. He said that, inter 
alia, the visit of the State Protection Office [UOP] head to 
Ukraine had not yet ensued on account of the trial. 
  The ambassador expressed thanks to Lysenko for "endurance 
and 
patriotism, and for not agreeing to be recruited by the UOP." 
The major himself, present at the news conference, told 
journalists that he was blackmailed and encouraged to change his 
citizenship, and to pass on state secrets to the Polish side.

<F P=106> [Article by Eliza Olczyk and Jerzy Pilczynski: </F>
"Continuation and New Elements; Budget Debate in Sejm"; two 
tables with data on state budget revenue and expenditures for 
1992-94 not included] 
  [Text] On Saturday [5 March], the Sejm will vote on 
the Budget Law, on principles of monetary policies, and on a 
resolution on increasing state revenues. Sejm Deputy Wieslawa 
Ziolkowska presented the results of work that went on for more 
than two months concerning the government's budget draft, on 
behalf of the Economic Policies, Budget, and Finance Commission. 
She recommended that the budget draft be adopted, even though 
she was also quite critical of it. According to the government, 
budget expenditures are supposed to be 696.1 trillion zlotys [Z] 
and budget revenue Z613 trillion, whereas the budget deficit 
should not exceed Z83 trillion. 
  The commission implemented only minor revisions to the 
draft. 
<H5>  Critical Report </H5>
  All proposals for increasing budget revenues and 
expenditures 
were rejected. Sejm Deputy Ziolkowska stressed that, in the 
commission's view, the budget proposed by the government allows 
neither for improving the efficiency of reforming and 
restructuring the economy, nor for a slowdown of regression 
trends regarding meeting basic social needs. 
  Ziolkowska reported on the commission's doubts regarding too 
optimistic assumptions contained in the draft concerning 
economic growth, a fall in inflation rates, export increases, 
and a too cautious evaluation of budget revenues. She also 
stressed the commission's critical remarks regarding excessive 
figures resulting from an assessment of sums of money devoted to 
the reimbursement of income taxes (Z24 trillion), and also an 
insufficient figure indicating revenue from the lump-sum tax 
[podatek zryczaltowany]--just Z7 trillion. The commission was 
also critical of the way of financing the domestic debt, which 
had been suggested by the government. Sejm Deputy Ziolkowska 
devoted much of her speech to social expenditures. These are 
planned to be Z46.5 trillion, which, among other things, will 
make it impossible to pay about 400,000 social assistance 
benefits--that figure is higher than last year, when there was 
not enough money for 250,000 of those entitled. Real [after 
accounting for inflation] expenditures on social assistance will 
drop by 4 percent. 
<H5>  Little Room for Maneuver </H5>
  The way the report was presented, which included 
Ziolkowska's 
subjective views, aroused critical remarks during the 
subsequent debate. [Acting Finance] Minister Henryk Chmielak 
also engaged himself in polemics regarding some of Ziolkowska's 
arguments. He admitted that the government budget draft cannot 
satisfy everyone, but he also stressed that the government's 
room for maneuver was restricted very much by factors like high 
unemployment levels, high costs of servicing the domestic and 
external debts, and disadvantageous demographic changes. These 
prevented the government from changing expenditure levels in 
many fields. But an increase in the sources of budget revenue 
is becoming a new trend. This should make it possible to achieve 
a 5-percent increase in those sources, or perhaps even higher 
than that. At that point, one will be able to think about 
increasing the expenditures. 

<H5>    Argument With Polish National Bank [NBP] </H5>
  Sejm Deputy Waldemar Michna of the Polish Peasant Party 
[PSL], while presenting a report on the work of the commission 
regarding the principles of monetary policies in 1994, stressed 
two significant changes: increasing the money supply from Z155 
trillion to Z169 trillion, and the possibility of the NBP's 
financing the budget deficit in the amount of Z35 trillion 
(instead of the Z30 trillion the NBP wanted to see.) NBP 
Chairwoman Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz did not rule out the 
possibility of increasing the money supply, but only by Z2 
trillion at most. Michna also made an appeal to the Sejm 
deputies not to change the level of financing the budget deficit 
by the NBP because that could lead to decreasing the banks' 
profits and a resultant decrease of the state budget revenue. 
  Apart from the draft of the Budget Law and the principles of 
monetary policies, Sejm deputies also debated a draft resolution 
coming from Sejm deputies that would oblige the government to 
seek additional possibilities of increasing the budget revenue 
that cannot be pinpointed right now, and to present them to the 
Sejm in midyear. 
  Sejm Deputies Mieczyslaw Czerniawski of the Democratic Left 
Alliance and PSL's Franciszek Stefaniuk, who spoke on behalf of 
their respective Sejm deputies clubs, declared their support for 
the budget. Both presented the difficult situation that is a 
legacy from the previous governments--that situation made it 
impossible to implement radical changes in the process of 
planning budget revenue and expenditures. They also stressed 
such positive aspects of the budget as the fact that its goal is 
acceleration of economic growth, a fall in inflation, a more 
just distribution of the burden of the impact of economic 
transformations, efforts to bring public finances to their 
health, an increase of financial means devoted to promoting 
exports, the introduction of investment-related breaks, and so 
forth. 
  Sejm Deputy Hanna Suchocka of the Democratic Union [UD] 
accused the governing coalition of refusing to fulfill the 
promises they had made during the election campaign, and also of 
being inconsistent in continuing the reforms. She also 
criticized the government for what is only a marginal 
implementation of the "Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises." 
She announced that the UD Sejm Deputies Club will not support 
the budget. 
  The same kind of declaration was made by Ryszard Bugaj of 
the 
Union of Labor. He listed five reasons: dubious macroeconomic 
assumptions, insufficient budget revenues (by about Z30 
trillion), a too restrictive monetary policy, lack of 
rationalization with regard to budget expenditures, and a 
mistaken concept of privatization. 
  At the end of Thursday's debate on the budget, Ownership 
Transformations Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek also engaged in 
polemics with critics of privatization. He said companies are 
impatient and tired "of waiting for more seals of approval, 
which are supposed to give them the right to undertake the risk 
of an economic game." He added that the Finance Ministry has 
already prepared a draft concerning the introduction of a 
so-called transaction fee, but one cannot assume that taxing 
income derived from the stock market will save the budget. The 
introduction of the fee must be preceded by a thorough analysis 
and linked to an increase in the supply of shares, and it must 
also take capital market development into account.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ryszard Bugaj, Sejm deputy and Union of </F>
Labor chairman, by correspondent Bohdan Onichimowski; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [Onichimowski] Acting on a recommendation 
submitted by the Union of Labor, the Sejm recently rejected the 
president's projects of new constitutional act. Does that mean 
that you have provoked a new "war at the top"? 
  [Bugaj] It is true that the Sejm acted on our 
recommendation, although I had mixed feelings about it because, 
in my opinion, the main difficulty was that the president's 
initiative could have delayed the progress of the ongoing work 
on the new Constitution. I believe that we must have a new 
Constitution in good time before the presidential election, but 
the president appears to think otherwise. On the other hand, as 
regards the "war at the top" question, I think that such a war 
could indeed be waged, but not necessarily for the 
above-mentioned reason. If the president were to stand at the 
head of the dissatisfied masses, could lead a war against the 
parliamentary majority, but that war would not necessarily be 
directed against us because we too dislike the policies of the 
present government. 
  [Onichimowski] It is said that four fundamental areas in the 
life of a state are crucial for its existence and survival. Let 
us try to evaluate the current state of affairs in each of these 
areas. The first of them is external security. 
  [Bugaj] The situation here is not felicitous. In the past 
year, we have noted unmistakable attempts to rebuild elements of 
Russia's imperial policies and a far-reaching skepticism on the 
part of our Western partners as regards the chances of their 
involvement in any operations designed to protect our security. 
I do not want to say that they are doing nothing at all in that 
direction, but they are certainly most restrained, if not 
reticent. Of course, there is no immediate reason to sound the 
alarm: The situation is far from wonderful, but it is not 
overly dramatic, either. Everything is still in our hands: We 
can and should decide ourselves whether our state is to be 
internally strong and cohesive, whether our citizens can be 
satisfied with their government and their parliament, and 
whether our economy is capable of producing surplus resources 
with which to finance adequate national defense so that we can 
rest safely in the knowledge that the situation in that area is 
not deteriorating. 
  [Onichimowski] The second sphere of concern is our internal 
security. 
  [Bugaj] Here a very considerable deterioration took place 
over the past years. Some people believe that this should be 
counteracted primarily by building up the numeric strength of 
our police force. Unfortunately, this will require substantial 
funds, but we should shape our policies so as to restrict and 
eradicate the root causes of social pathology. After all, we do 
not have enough resources to provide three policemen to patrol 
every street corner and enough police presence to watch every 
house in every area. The causes of the mounting incidence of 
crime are to be found in the widening gap between different 
groups' financial circumstances, and also in the growing 
unemployment.... It is no accident that people can walk 
everywhere in perfect safety in the streets of Scandinavian 
cities. 
  [Onichimowski] The rising incidence of tuberculosis in our 
society is not a favorable reflection on our successive 
governments' record in the area of health protection, is it? 
  [Bugaj] In this respect, we are, in my opinion, on the eve 
of the introduction of a substantial and much-needed reform, 
which, however, is still waiting to be put into practice. 
  [Onichimowski] Instead, there has been much discussion about 
it for many years now.... 
  [Bugaj] I agree with you: Much is said, and nothing 
happens. All that is happening at present is that the health 
service's budget is being reduced, money is being taken away 
from vital health services, and there are no visible signs of 
progress in organizational actions or the construction of a 
rational financial system for the sector. I find the present 
situation deplorable. It is most probably being continuously 
compounded by the repeated changes of health ministers and by 
the fact that we still have no public-service system, which 
would go on working and discharging its duties regardless of the 
constantly changing political configurations. 
  [Onichimowski] And, finally, the fourth sector. It is 
paradoxical that the standards of education, the unrestricted 
availability of cultural goods, and the general level of 
civilizational development attained under the Polish People's 
Republic was instrumental in overthrowing that regime, whereas 
our new sociopolitical system has brought a pronounced 
regression in all of these areas. 
  [Bujak] If we are to discuss the realm of culture, we must 
admit that in certain areas state patronage was far from 
rational: It was geared a little too obviously to the promotion 
of specific ideological messages. Unfortunately, the state's 
withdrawal from its patronage role has been too drastic. On the 
other hand, education definitely needs funds urgently, and that 
money must be found somewhere. I believe that, regardless of 
the reasons for the present state of affairs, we have already 
moved past the worst depression in this area, and there is some 
hope that the situation will gradually improve. 
  [Onichimowski] To conclude, let us touch on a subject close 
to your own heart: privatization. What do you think of the 
proposal to recall Deputy Bogdan Pek from his post of chairman 
of the Sejm Commission for Ownership Transformations? 
  [Bugaj] I am emphatically against this idea. Even if Deputy 
Pek has at times been clumsily "undiplomatic" in his attempts to 
investigate the truth and counteract the pathological phenomena 
that abound in the field of privatization, he has nevertheless 
demonstrated real integrity and determination in uncovering such 
instances and battling against them. If he were to be recalled, 
it would be a symbolic act pointing clearly to the Sejm 
majority's intention to cover up for and protect those guilty of 
suspect practices. From what I know of the privatization 
process, there is much questionable activity associated with it, 
so we should stop viewing it entirely theoretically and instead 
begin taking pragmatic action. We certainly need to increase 
parliamentary control over these processes. 
  [Onichimowski] Thank you for talking to us.

  [Text] At the Democratic Union [UD] special congress that 
ended today, the delegates decided to merge with the Liberal 
Democratic Congress [KLD] and set up a new party. 
  The UD congress adopted several resolutions. The issue of 
strikes announced by Solidarity gave rise to controversies. In 
the end, a resolution was adopted saying that this action would 
not bring the public lasting benefits but could lead to 
destabilization of the economy. 
  In another resolution, the UD congress objected to the 
policy 
pursued by Waldemar Pawlak's government of centralizing 
administration and restricting the sovereignty of local 
self-government. 
  The congress protested against actions that strike at the 
independence of the National Broadcasting and Television 
Council. Tadeusz Mazowiecki remains leader of UD. He will 
probably also be the leader of the new group.

  [Text] The Slupsk heat and power generating plant and the 
timber enterprise in Slawno are the first to join the Solidarity 
nationwide protest action announced for today. 
  Solidarity National Commission Spokesman Piotr Zak told us 
that strikes could also start in other parts of Poland. The 
strike that is just starting will circulate to cover selected 
regions, industries, and enterprises. The nationwide strike 
will take place in the metal and mining industries and on the 
railways. 
  The Solidarity spokesman, who was the guest of the morning 
program on Radio Lodz, said that the railways would go on strike 
on Thursday or Friday. If the strike on the railways is 
repeated, only freight trains will be stopped. Piotr Zak also 
said the the Solidarity power industry section decided that 
state administration buildings and enterprises owing money to 
the power industry will be the first to have their electricity 
cut off.

  [Stahlavsky] Vaclav Havel received the Georgian president 
for 
an approximately hour-long meeting at Prague Castle and welcomed 
this opportunity to discuss bilateral relations. For example, 
Georgia will open an embassy in Prague that will also deal with 
other Central European countries. For its part, the Czech 
Republic will open a Consulate General in Tbilisi, and both 
diplomatic representations will be preparing a system of 
treaties to secure wider cooperation. At their meeting, both 
presidents exchanged their views on the situation in Georgia, 
which is being troubled by civil and ethnic war, in Russia, and 
in other parts of the world. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Eduard Shevardnadze, the highest Georgian 
representative, stopped over in Prague briefly on his way to the 
United States. He was received at Prague Castle by President 
Vaclav Havel. The two statesmen then briefed journalists in 
detail about their hour-long conversation. Our correspondent 
David Stahlavsky, who was there, reports: 
  [Stahlavsky] President Vaclav Havel welcomed the possibility 
to have talks, albeit brief ones, with the chairman of the State 
Council of this Transcaucasian country. Apart from bilateral 
Czech-Georgian relations, they also discussed the situation in 
Georgia itself, which is being troubled by a civil war and wars 
among various ethnic groups, and about the situation in Russia 
and in the Euro-Asian region. [passage omitted] 
  Vaclav Havel stressed: 
  [Begin Havel recording] We have promised that, as a 
nonpermanent member of the Security Council, we would support 
such resolutions that will promote peace in Georgia and in the 
entire region and the special development of Georgia as an 
independent state. [end recording] 
  [Stahlavsky] In this regard, Eduard Shevardnadze admitted 
that he considered it necessary to explain to the president of 
the Czech Republic, which is a nonpermanent member of the UN 
Security Council, Georgia's attitude toward the conflict in 
Abkhazia and to ask for support for a just solution to the 
conflict that is now coming to a head. 
  After the talks between Havel and Shevardnadze, the Georgian 
leader noted that full understanding has been achieved. The 
chairman of the State Council of Georgia also noted that, 
without the decisive participation of Russia, as a permanent 
member of the Security Council and the great neighbor of 
Georgia, peace in his country and in Abkhazia will not be 
achieved. Shevardnadze and Yeltsin [as heard], however, have 
found mutual understanding on the question of the Abkhazian 
conflict. 
  It was for these reasons that Georgia joined the CIS in 
October 1993. [passage indistinct] 
  The reasons were, as the highest Georgian representative 
said, the close economic relations with Russia, without which 
independent Georgia cannot exist. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Nada Adamickova: "Belgium Is Concerned About </F>
NATO's Operation"] 
  [Text] Belgium has always strived to ensure that the North 
Atlantic Alliance functions well and, therefore, tries not to 
complicate its work. Although, on the one hand, it wants to 
open up this structure, it is, on the other, concerned that this 
step could complicate its operation. 
  This statement was made by Ch. F. Nothomb, chairman of the 
Belgian Parliament's Chamber of Representatives, in response to 
a question from his Czech counterpart, M. Uhde (Civic Democratic 
Party), concerning the prospects for the development of the 
security structures. Nothomb added that the Western European 
Union is an excellent base for "the eventuality that has not yet 
arisen. Only after its shortcomings have been eliminated can 
the issue of its expansion come onto the agenda." The chairman 
of the Chamber of Representatives, in this context, asked M. 
Uhde whether the trend toward incorporation into European 
structures is the stance of the government majority alone or 
whether it is also the view held by the opposition. Uhde 
declared that this is the majority opinion, with the exception 
of part of the opposition. 
  On Wednesday [23 February], during his official two-day 
visit 
to Belgium, the chairman of the Czech Parliament also met other 
deputies and senators. The two sides exchanged information on 
the functioning of a constitutional system. Deputies from the 
Benelux Interparliamentary Council, during their meeting with 
the Czech parliamentary delegation, expressed their confusion 
about the Czech Republic's attitude toward Visegrad. They 
commented on the fact that, while Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia 
support cooperation within the Visegrad Group, the stance of the 
Czech Republic is somewhat reserved. The Czech Parliament 
representatives said in response to this that our country has 
nothing against bilateral agreements; nevertheless, it is not 
enthusiastic about the formation of broad structures.

<F P=106> [Article by Chamber of Deputies Chairman Milan Uhde: "An </F>
Important Objective Is To Not Provoke the Russians"] 
  [Text] During its visit to Luxembourg and Belgium, the 
Czech Republic Chamber of Deputies delegation had many 
interesting experiences, was asked probing and astute questions, 
and, in turn, asked about many things and found out a great 
deal. However, an impromptu oral survey conducted in the 
delegation evinced, among extremely stimulating ideas, the 
following observation from one of our foreign colleagues: The 
Partnership for Peace [PFP] is the only feasible chance for you 
Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, and Poles. You surely understand 
that we must not provoke the Russians. 
  I explained to him and to other people who showed an 
interest 
that we accept the PFP and that we understand it: States that 
are politically, economically, and militarily undeveloped cannot 
be immediately incorporated into NATO. We did not expect 
immediate admission, just a guarantee of the prospect that the 
doors have not been closed to us, that they will not be closed, 
and that admission depends, first and foremost, on us, on our 
readiness, maturity, and resolve. 
  Provocation is a feeble policy, and, in politics, it is 
rightly regarded as desperate. I am opposed to anyone being 
provoked, and I understand that the Russians would not like it 
if security structures were to evolve in Europe without them as 
if they were oriented against them. The PFP leaves the 
development of these structures wide open because the situation 
is still evolving in all of the postcommunist countries, and, 
therefore, it would not be prudent to anticipate the outcome of 
development and make premature and definitive decisions. 
  However, it would be equally ineffectual not to do anything 
that could provoke the Russians. This means something that would 
only seem like a provocation. I remember the touching 
tragicomic attempt in 1968 by the reform communists not to 
provoke Moscow. Reproaches for the so-called ill-considered 
anti-Soviet excesses in the democratized mass media dragged on 
into the private discussions of the 1968-ers long after the 
occupying tanks had been on our territory. A renowned professor 
was still saying 10 years later that the caricatures in 
LITERARNI NOVINY were partly to blame. 
  Masaryk [Tomas Garrigue Masaryk] dealt with a similar rebuke 
in his monograph on Havlicek [Karel Havlicek Borovsky]. Palacky 
[Frantisek Palacky] and Havlicek were certainly closer to him 
than Sabina [Karel Sabina 1813-77, radical writer] and Fric 
[Josef Vaclav Fric 1829-90, radical politician], yet he rejected 
Palacky's explanation that the military intervention against 
Prague in 1848 was provoked by the irresponsible radicalism of 
the people on the barricades. If Palacky has based his 
political concept on foundations that could have been torn up by 
the provocations of foolhardy people, they are such weak 
foundations that it is impossible to take them seriously, 
commented the future Czechoslovak president. 
  If a politician or group of politicians in Europe relies on 
the supposition that, if there is no provocation, everything 
will turn out all right, he is terribly mistaken. Every devotee 
of the Yalta ideal of an eternally valid division into spheres 
of influence and of the philosophy that whoever has influence 
ascribed to him has the right to regard everything that 
repudiates it as a provocation will interpret every departure 
from authentic political conduct of a free state as a weakness. 
  We know well this way of thinking; the Czechs and other 
nations have experienced it firsthand. It is time to emphasize 
again what has obviously not been stated clearly enough until 
now: Every state in Europe will have as much influence as it 
can achieve by its internal democratic arrangement, its 
application of the principles of a law-governed state, and its 
observance of human rights; to sum up, by showing respect for 
the freedom guaranteed by a market economy, freedom crowned by 
spiritual and cultural symbolization. 
  Influence based on anything else--for instance, on the 
threat 
of countermeasures if the small postcommunist states acknowledge 
the European values that NATO was set up to defend--is like 
beating a tattoo on old drums. I hope that Czech policy will 
always put up stiff resistance to this. I am absolutely 
convinced that it will not be alone.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec by Bohumil </F>
Pecinka; place and date not given: "Will the Russian Bear Creep 
Up on Us?"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Pecinka] It seems that 
participation in the Partnership for Peace [PFP] initiative is a 
condition for our entry into NATO but not a guarantee of our 
admission. Who will be the judge, the one who says the Czech 
Republic is ready to join the Alliance? Are there any criteria 
at all? 
  [Zieleniec] I do not think it is possible to set any 
criteria because we have entered into the very sensitive area of 
Europe's future security structure. If you were to set 
criteria, you would now be saying: You, yes and you, no. Mind 
you, it is possible to visualize very precisely who is capable 
of fulfilling which criterion. On the other hand, if the 
program is formulated politically--that is, provided it is 
oriented toward forging political ties between the Alliance and 
individual states--the countries that can and want to will come 
closer to NATO, and vice versa. I would also like to say that 
NATO's expansion is a process in whose quality we should also be 
interested. It must also be in our interests to ensure that the 
Alliance does not lose its quality. Too much opening up could 
mean that states that could become a source of instability could 
be integrated within the Alliance. 
  [Pecinka] Soon after President Clinton's visit to Europe, it 
became apparent that there are, to say the least, two 
interpretations of the PFP. The Central Europeans are thinking 
about the fastest possible and individual admission into NATO. 
On the other hand, Russia views this initiative as the first 
step toward the transformation of NATO, which will ultimately 
incorporate all of the postcommunist states at the same time.... 
  [Zieleniec] It is clear that everyone interprets a given 
political fact according to his own interests. I do not think, 
however, that Russia's voice will be the decisive one here. 
  [Pecinka] What, then, will be decisive? 
  [Zieleniec] The security situation in Europe. Look, 
unforeseen security developments in East Europe could mean that 
NATO may try to provide security for the buffer zone and rapidly 
expand toward the east. On the other hand, if slower 
development were to act as a stimulus for stabilizing democracy 
in Russia, rather than for confrontation with the West, this 
would also be worth taking into consideration. I think the NATO 
countries will come up with a solution with two alternatives, 
which is a classic example of political tactics.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jaromir Novotny, director general of the </F>
Foreign Relations Section of the Czech Ministry of Defense, by 
Jiri Stastny; place and date not given: "Jaromir Novotny: The 
Reinforcement of UNPROFOR Units Was a Russian Initiative"] 
  [Text] Because of developments in the former 
Yugoslavia, where the Czech Republic has a strong military 
representation, and the unexpected entry of Russian politics to 
this region, we asked Jaromir Novotny, director general of the 
Foreign Relations Section of the Czech Ministry of Defense, a 
number of questions. 
  [Stastny] Does our policy of reinforcing the Czech units 
follow some long-term objective, and when will the name of our 
officer who has been appointed commander of the South Sector 
units be published? 
  [Novotny] Our Republic was officially requested to 
commission an officer to assume command of the South units on 30 
April 1994. The officer's name will be released as soon as the 
appointment is approved by the appropriate UN bodies. I believe 
that it shows an appreciation of the work of our soldiers in 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and recognition of the fact that 
our battalion has operated in the region since the beginning of 
the conflict. At this time, we have in Yugoslavia a chief of 
staff, Taichman, whose work is highly valued. 
  [Stastny] Did the reinforcement of Russian units to double 
the original strength take place at the request of the UNPROFOR 
command, or did the initiative come from the Russian side? 
  [Novotny] According to my sources, the Russian side offered 
its units, and the UNPROFOR command accepted the offer. All of 
the other activities, including the transfer of Russian units to 
other territories, are conducted at the request of the command. 
I believe that these units are subordinated to the UNPROFOR 
command like all of the others. This body expressed its 
agreement to their transfer to the Sarajevo region and, as far 
as I know, additional paratrooper units have also been offered, 
but that is a matter for UNPROFOR to comment on. 
  [Stastny] Have you been consulted regarding Minister 
Baudys's initiative? 
  [Novotny] At the time this idea was taking shape, I was 
abroad--with our soldiers in Serbian Krajina. Moreover, a 
subordinate cannot assess the work of his superior.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans Rauscher: "Austrian Aggression"] </F>
  [Text] Where did Vaclav Klaus learn the news first?--in 
KURIER. In an interview in Prague on Thursday afternoon [3 
March], he was taken aback by the postponement of the decision 
on a loan of the U.S. ExIm Bank valued at billions [currency not 
specified] for the completion of Temelin [nuclear power plant]. 
"I have not yet heard that. This is questionable information," 
said the Czech prime minister (who speaks fluent German and, of 
course, English). 
  Now the crisis between Prague and Vienna has become even 
further aggravated. Klaus, an unreserved advocate of the market 
economy, does not understand why the Austrians and his 
counterpart, Vranitzky, want to torpedo a project that he 
regards as necessary for the--very good--economic development of 
the Czech Republic. Apparently, the Austrian intervention in 
Washington has now been temporarily successful after all. This 
provoked a harsh reaction from Klaus: "Whether these are three 
or eight deputies out of 480--this is not enough for me. This 
is also not enough for me after such aggressiveness from the 
Austrian side." 
  "This Austrian reaction is really impossible for me. The 
completion of Temelin is absolutely necessary for us, and all 
reasonable Austrians within and outside the government know 
that. Nevertheless, they are playing this card for the election 
campaign." 
  But is the government not making allowances for a real 
concern of the population? "As it happened, I was skiing in St. 
Anton, and I saw an opinion poll on ORF, according to which the 
three most important topics for the Austrians are pensions, full 
employment, and crime, but not Temelin. I do not believe that 
Temelin is something that the Austrians have deep in their 
heart. It is rather a political matter and is connected with 
the elections." 
  But what about relations between the Czech Republic and 
Austria? "Normal daily relations between Austria and the Czech 
Republic, between hundreds, thousands, and millions of people, 
will continue completely normally, without any deterioration, 
which may only take place on a large-scale political level, 
where the political card is played." 
  It is often heard from the Czechs that the Austrians want to 
keep them in tutelage. "This is not a question of pride; it is 
a question of wrong arguments on the Austrian side. What 
alternative have you proposed to us? You proposed investments 
for your firms, which are often owned by the state and 
subsidized (transformation into gas power plants--the editors). 
This was not a gift; it was only state-organized lobbying for 
Austrian investments in our country. Austria's proposals are 
not so innocent, and the Austrian politicians should not pretend 
to be so innocent." 
  Should Austria have been more tactful? "The question is put 
in an absolutely wrong way. The construction work in Temelin 
has already progressed very far. The decision was not new, and 
this should be taken into account. The other question is: The 
ecological catastrophe for us is northern Bohemia, with the coal 
power plants, not southern Bohemia, with nuclear power." 
  It is said in Austria that it is intended to export 
electricity from Temelin in order to improve the Czech balance 
of payments? 
  "We do not need to improve the balance of payments. It is 
active. We told Austrian politicians a hundred times--no, we are 
not building Temelin for electricity exports--but no one wants 
to hear or understand that." 
  Apparently Vaclav Klaus really feels misunderstood. What is 
his wish for relations with Austria? The answer is 
characteristic of this strict liberal: 
  "We are moving very quickly to a free society, a free market 
economy, and an open society. Therefore, we expect the same of 
others who had the advantage that they did not have to live 
under communism for 40 years. I mean opening up not only in the 
field of economy but also in a wider sense."

  [Text] Brno--A new Air Force and Air Defense Faculty was 
opened yesterday at the Military Academy in Brno. According to 
the Academy's spokesman, Major Pavel Pazdera, pilots, aircraft 
technical specialists, and airfield servicing staff will be 
trained at the faculty. Graduates receive an electronic-based 
education that can also be applied at civilian airports. The 
faculty's establishment comes as a result of the reorganization 
of the Academy and of the requirements for training aircraft 
specialists for the Czech Army. The only military Air Force 
college in the former CSFR was in Kosice.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak President Michal Kovac by Jan </F>
Forowicz; place and date not given: "We Have Avoided Social 
Tension and Strikes"] 
  [Excerpts] [Forowicz] When will Polish-Slovak relations 
shape themselves in the way they should in view of our 
geographic and linguistic proximity? Poland's involvement in 
Slovak trade is barely 2.4 percent. When will all of the 
declarations be implemented about improving this state of 
affairs and about the desire for cooperation? 
  [Kovac] I am sure that this has already begun. My first 
historic visit--and I do not hesitate to describe it thus--to 
Warsaw at the invitation of President Walesa in January was the 
first step that brought very concrete results. I also spoke to 
politicians and economists. Among other things, I visited the 
Polish Business Center Club in the Lubomirski Palace, where you 
have your officers' club. 
  When one bakes bread, one starts with the dough. Poland is 
the first partner with which we have developed genuinely 
practical cooperation in combating economic crime. 
  Fourteen Polish-Slovak deals are waiting to be signed by 
Prime Minister Pawlak during his visit to Bratislava, which has 
been scheduled for April. These mainly involve an 
intensification of cooperation, but one of them is an agreement 
on avoiding double taxation and another deals with the 
protection of investment. [passage omitted] 
  [Forowicz] The present process of democratization does not 
make it easy for our countries to appear as stable countries 
worthy of quickly joining Western security structures. 
  [Kovac] It is quite normal for countries such as ours to 
have to adapt themselves. But, if we want to join NATO soon, we 
must show that we are a partner that one can depend on. It is 
essential to show that a potential NATO member has no quarrels 
with its neighbors and is pursuing a stable domestic policy. It 
is worth underlining how important it is for our countries' 
image to have such initiatives as the Visegrad Group, a group of 
countries that are friendly toward one another and are trying to 
tighten their cooperation. 
  [Forowicz] What universal message would you have for the 
soldiers and politicians concerned with the defense capability 
of Poland and Slovakia? 
  [Kovac] The armies of both of our countries are also 
experiencing a period of change. Nevertheless, they are 
presenting their countries' defense potential. 
  Unfortunately, a situation has arisen in which the Army 
reforms must take place at a time of a shortage of funds. Added 
to this are the costly commitments brought on by Partnership for 
Peace [PFP]. 
  Everything requires a lot of discipline and patriotism and 
an 
ability to extract the maximum effect from relatively meager 
funds. That is why we need excellent and rational leaders now 
more than ever. We need military men who speak foreign 
languages. Leaders are required who set an example of 
professional conduct to the people under their command. Thanks 
to people with such qualities, I expect each of our armies will 
strengthen its morale.

  [Excerpt] The Republican Council of the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] held a session in Trnava. Its 
members discussed preparations for early parliamentary and local 
elections and elected new officials of the Movement's council. 
The final briefing was attended by newly elected Chairman Arpad 
Matejka and HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar. Peter Toman, 
representing our Radiozurnal, interviewed them. 
  [Begin recording] [Toman] Mr. Chairman, what in your view 
are 
the most important conclusions reached at today's session of the 
Council? 
  [Meciar] In substance, a decision was made to form working 
groups to work on the final draft of the Movement's 
program--that is, our election program--which we expect to turn 
subsequently into our government program. 
  The other important thing was the election of the bodies of 
the Council: new Chairman Arpad Matejka and new Deputy Chairman 
Zlocha. Mr. Mihalik continues to be the secretary. They were 
elected by secret ballot in several rounds. 
  The third thing I consider important is that the strategy of 
two options has been more or less drafted: either to go three 
times to election ballot boxes--i.e., a referendum and major 
elections and small elections [not further explained]--or just 
to have the two elections. These issues were drafted and agreed 
upon, and I think that everybody is [word indistinct] going to 
work on them. 
  [Toman] Did you discuss preparations for local elections, 
too? 
  [Meciar] Yes, the selection of candidates and coalition 
strategy is a matter for local bodies. [passage omitted] [end 
recording]

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] The second meeting this year between 
13 journalists and politicians took place in Bratislava today. 
These meetings are being organized for the third successive year 
by the weekly SLOBODNY PIATOK [FREE FRIDAY]. In place of the 
traditional one invited guest, today's meeting was attended by 
five guests, who were representatives of nonparliamentary 
political parties: the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia 
[SSDS], the Christian Social Union [KSU], the Party of 
Conservative Democrats [SKD], and the Party of the Green in 
Slovakia [SZ]. They were represented by their leaders Jaroslav 
Volf [SSDS], Jan Klepac [KSU], Pavol Hagyari [SKD] and Jozef 
Pokorny [SZS]. The Hungarian Civic Party [MOS] sent its deputy 
chairman Janos Toth. Our editor Ludmila Bulakova prepared for us 
a digest of this debate, which lasted over an hour. 
  [Begin recording] [Bulakova] [passage omitted] Mr. Klepac 
[KSU], what would your position be if you were in government? 
  [Klepac] I think it is necessary to gather enough courage 
and 
draw a line behind the past, but it should not be a line that 
prevents us from talking about the past. [passage omitted] It is 
necessary to say everything so that the citizens know why the 
lustration law [passed by the former federal authorities as a 
vetting system for the highest administrative, legislative, and 
executive posts] is valid but not applied, why the assets of the 
communist party have not been dealt with, why companies and 
state organizations are still being chaired by former exponents 
of the past regime, and other issues. 
  Mr. Meciar promised when he assumed power that he would 
release a so-called white book on what happened in Slovakia. I 
am surprised that this white book has not yet seen the light of 
day. [passage omitted] 
  [Bulakova] What about you, Mr. Toth? 
  [Toth] I think that the minority issue is not isolated and 
cannot be isolated from the social and economic dimension 
wherein it exists. It is imperative to deal with the Slovak 
social and economic problems; otherwise, there could be a total 
collapse of the economy. Needless to say, the social 
consequences of such a collapse would be incalculable. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Two hundred delegates of the Conservative 
Democratic Party-Democratic Party [KDS-DS] held their 
constitutional congress in Bratislava today. Their aim was to 
finalize the merger of these two nonparliamentary parties of the 
political right. Correspondent Oto Goerner interviewed Pavol 
Hagyari, the newly elected chairman of the party. 
  [Begin recording] [Hagyari] The constitutional congress 
decided the name of the new party. Three names were proposed: 
the Democratic Party; Conservative Democratic Party-Democratic 
Party, a double-barrelled name; and the Party of the Democratic 
Right. The first proposal was given a clear majority, which 
means that, as of today, we are to be called the "Democratic 
Party." I am convinced a new, strong party of the right is 
being created, which in the last elections attracted 10 percent 
of the voters. We are convinced the same will be the case at 
the next elections that may be held very soon. 
  [Goerner] Is it not a paradox that there are some parties 
splitting in the present climate while the KDS and the DS merge? 
  [Hagyari] It is also a question of political foresight. If 
the Civic Right failed in the last elections because it was 
split, if we can learn from our own mistakes and from the 
mistakes of the Polish right, then we are left only with merging 
into one political spectrum with more right-of-center 
nonparliamentary parties. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The "Democratic Party" is the name of the new 
political entity that came into being as a result of a merger of 
the Conservative Democratic Party and the Democratic Party. The 
merger took place at a two-day congress that ended in Bratislava 
today. 
  The Democratic Party unites the former membership base of 
the 
Civic Democratic Union, the Democratic Party, the Civic 
Democratic Party of Slovakia, Democrats 92, the Czech-Slovak 
Understanding, and the Green League. Pavol Hagyari has become 
chairman of the Party. We asked him what the merger means: 
  [Begin Hagyari recording] The merger of the civic right wing 
that is taking place today and the early parliamentary elections 
will make it possible for the civic right wing to get into 
parliament and, possibly, even into the government. [passage 
omitted] 
  We are interested in solving the economic crisis. We are 
interested in solving the political crisis as soon as possible. 
Politics must return to where it belongs--to the citizens. We 
are interested in solving the actual problems of real citizens, 
and our policies are like those of the West European countries, 
like those of parties similar to ours. The basic thing is a 
fast and thorough transformation--clean and clear privatization, 
the creation of resources, and the consequent solving of the 
problems of unemployment, living standards, criminality, health 
care, and education. [end recording]

  [Text] The government did not breach its duties vis-a-vis 
the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, the statement by the 
Press and Information Department of the Slovak Government office 
says. This statement has been passed to the Slovak Republic 
News Agency in connection with the decision of the Slovak 
Constitutional Court regarding the proposal put forward by 38 
deputies to the National Council [of the Slovak Republic], 
requesting that proceedings be launched in the matter of 
interpreting the provisions of the Constitution. The deputies' 
request concerned the action taken by Prime Minister Vladimir 
Meciar, who, on 1 March of last year, returned the bill on the 
state budget and the changes in social security laws to the 
parliament to be debated the second time around. Meciar 
justified this by saying that putting these laws into effect 
and, in particular, paying out state supplements on child 
benefits would make the state budget short 3.7 billion korunas. 
From the ruling passed by the Constitutional Court decision, it 
transpires that those responsible for the delay [in passing the 
bill] are the deputies from the Christian Democratic Movement, 
the Party of the Democratic Left, and other deputies, who 
refused to debate the bills, although it is their duty, the 
statement by the Press and Information Department of the 
Government office says.

  [Text] Zagreb, March 5 (TANJUG) -- Croatia will seek from 
the U.N. Security Council before the expiration of the U.N. 
peace-keepers' mandate on March 31 to restore full control of 
its borders, the Croatian Defence and National Security Council 
ruled on Saturday. 
  "We have received firm guarantees for the security of the 
Croatian state, a speedier reintegration of the U.N.-protected 
areas into Croatia's constitutional and legal system and the 
earliest possible repatriation of all refugees," said the 
council at a session chaired by Croatian President Franjo 
Tudjman. 
  Croatia considers as its territory the Republic of Serb 
Krajina (RSK), which was proclaimed by Serbs in their ethnic and 
historical territories in Croatia in 1991. The RSK, which was 
placed under U.N. protection in the spring of 1992, 
energetically opposes any idea of Croatia controlling its 
territory. 
  Commenting on the Moslem-Croat agreement reached in 
Washington on Tuesday on creating a federation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Croatian Defence and National Security 
Council said it was a historic event which further consolidated 
the independent and sovereign Croatian state and ensured the 
survival of the Croatian people in Bosnia. 
  The agreement also fully protects the strategic interests of 
the Croatian state, the council said in a statement. 
  "The agreement is not directed against the interests of the 
Serb side in Bosnia...and it will enable the finding of a 
solution acceptable to all three nations in Bosnia together with 
the Serb side," it added. 
  The preliminary agreement on forming a Moslem-Croat 
federation in the war-torn former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, signed under strong pressure from 
Washington, envisages that the federation subsequently form 
confederate ties with neighbouring Croatia.

  [Text] The 37th session of the Presidential Council for 
Defense and National Security was held in the Presidential 
Palace today, chaired by the president of the Republic of 
Croatia, Franjo Tudjman, the president's office has announced. 
Here is a statement from the session we have just received. 
  The council reviewed the importance and circumstances of the 
Washington preliminary agreement on the establishment of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on a federal basis as a union of inherently 
sovereign peoples in the Federal Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
and its entering a confederal union with the Republic of 
Croatia. The delegation of the Republic of Croatia, which was 
headed by Foreign Minister Mate Granic and took part in drawing 
up and signing the preliminary agreement, submitted a report to 
the council. 
  The council Described the agreement as a historic event, 
which further develops and strengthens the independent and 
sovereign Croatian state and which secures the survival of the 
Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and congratulated President 
Tudjman and the Croatian delegation on the agreement. With its 
active and consistent policy toward the European Community and 
world factors, the Croatian state policy has created 
preconditions and made possible the adoption of the agreement 
and the reaching of accord with the Bosnian Muslim delegation, 
while fully preserving the strategic interests of the Croatian 
state. 
  The agreement of the Muslim and Croatian sides is not 
directed against the Serb side, and makes it possible to find a 
solution with the Serb side that will be acceptable to all three 
nations within Bosnia-Herzegovina. The agreement marks the 
success of Croatia's consistent policy implemented through 
several agreements with the Bosnian Muslim leaders, President 
Tudjman's letter to President Clinton, the participation in the 
drawing up and adoption of Cutilheiro's plan on cantons, the 
Vance-Owan plan on provinces and the Vance-Stoltenberg plan on 
the union of republics, and President Tudjman's recent peace 
initiative. The agreement also shows that major world factors 
have accepted Croatia. 
  This also marks a change in the views of the United States 
and leading European countries, indicating their resolve 
regarding a solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in 
the area of the former Yugoslavia. This agreement, which 
heralds peace, has considerably consolidated Croatia's 
international position as Croatia's interests correspond with 
those of the West. Thanks to its principled policies Croatia 
has been accepted as an entity with which the United States and 
the EC are conducting international policies. 
  Croatia is no longer under the threat of sanctions. On the 
contrary, full support has been demonstrated for the security of 
the Croatian state and a quicker reintegration of the UN 
protected areas into the constitutional and legal framework of 
the Republic of Croatia and for the return of refugees at the 
earliest possible moment. The aid needed for the restoration of 
the country has been promised, while prospects are also opening 
up for economic cooperation because the signed agreement has met 
with positive reactions not only in the Western world but also 
in Islamic countries. 
  The government of the Republic of Croatia will raise a 
number 
of concrete demands with United States, EC, and international 
financial institutions to secure the aid promised for the 
restoration of the country and for financing individual 
projects. A delegation to take part in the further negotiations 
in Vienna has also been appointed. It is tasked with drawing up 
all relevant documents for signing a final agreement at the 
highest level. 
  The Council also discussed the imminent expiry of the UN 
Protection Forces mandate in Croatia. To this effect it decided 
to prepare a demand for concrete measures, the emphasis of which 
should be placed on full control over Croatian borders. The 
demands will be submitted to the UN Security Council before the 
expiry of the mandate. 
  Discussing the continuation of the initiated process of 
normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations, the council stated 
that the process of normalization ought to continue but one has 
also to resolutely let the other side know that Croatian and 
international interests will not tolerate any further attempts 
at outmaneuvering the implementation of relevant UN resolutions. 
  At its session today the council also discussed the need to 
finalize as soon as possible the procedure of appointing the 
state judiciary council. In this context it appointed a group 
who will inform it about what has been done so far, it is 
written at the end of the statement from the session of the 
Presidential Council of Defense and National Security.

  [Text] Kragujevac, 6 Mar (TANJUG) -- Djordje Bjegovic, 
prime minister of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], has 
described the Washington agreement on the Muslim-Croat 
federation as tendentious and as a signal to continue attempts 
to bring down the republic of Serb Krajina or to bring it back 
into Croatia. 
  Bjegovic told Kragujevac radio's "Hallmark of the Times" 
program today that the agreement has given a green light to 
Croatia to regulate some matters in the way it finds most 
suitable. 
  Therefore, according to Bjegovic, great caution is needed, 
primarily concerning defense matters, because this is a time 
when crucial issues are being resolved. 
  The Washington agreement would also be crucial because now 
is 
the time to show our strength, and the European Union must be 
reminded of the facts again: that the RSK has existed for four 
years and it's future lies in joining with the Srpska republic 
and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  Commenting on reports that the four downed planes had taken 
off from Udbine airport in the RSK, Bjegovic said this is "yet 
another international game and a way to get in for those who 
want to get into the region and get involved, with the objective 
of serving their own interests." 
  There will certainly be more such games and the RSK has no 
interest in any confrontation in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
It is therefore necessary to thoroughly probe the affair of the 
planes and to provide proper evidence, for only in that way can 
the truth be established, Bjegovic said. 
  He said it is necessary to achieve peace in order to begin 
with production and to reestablish traffic and infrastructure, 
because institutional matters have already been resolved [as 
received].

  [Text] Zagreb, March 6 (AFP) -- A weekend artillery duel 
between Croatian Army troops and breakaway Serbs in the Krajina 
region left a woman dead and several people wounded, news 
reports and the United Nations said. 
  The official Croatian news agency HINA said the shelling 
broke out late Saturday and continued into Sunday morning. The 
UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) confirmed the fighting but not 
the casualty report. 
  Shelling in the Gospic area of southern Croatia increased 
Sunday with UN troops counting 87 Croatian Army shells to 80 
fired by Serb forces. One shell landed 20 metres (yards) from a 
positions held by Czech UN troops, while two mortar shells fell 
between 100 and 200 metres (yards) from another Czech post, 
UNPROFOR said. The Czechs had reported sporadic shelling in the 
area late Saturday. 
  The fighting comes a week after both sides extended to March 
31 a Christmas ceasefire. Until now the truce had been 
respected in three of four zones controlled by secessionist 
Serbs and monitored by UN troops. 
  The truce has been violated on numerous occasions, mainly 
around the strategic Maslenica bridge, the only route linking 
Zagreb with the heavily populated Dalmatian coastline in 
southern Croatia. 
  Croatian Serbs seized the Krajina region in the civil war 
that broke out in 1991 when Zagreb declared independence from 
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Knin, March 7 (TANJUG) -- Intensive Croat-Serb 
fighting has taken place in the broader area of Teslingrad in 
the northwest of the republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) during 
the past 24 hours, after Croatian troops violated the latest 
ceasefire agreement. 
  The R.S.K. army command said in a statement on Monday that 
the fighting took place in the area of Cukovac, which was 
captured by Croatian troops on Saturday. However, following 
strong pressure by the Serb forces and after suffering 
considerable casualties, Croatian troops were forced to withdraw 
to their initial positions. 
  The same source said that the crushing of the last 
strongholds of the Croatian army in the area was underway. 
  The Serb forces have suffered no casualties in the fighting 
although considerable material damage has been inflicted on 
civilian targets. 
  The statement said that Croatian forces had on several 
occasions provoked the Serb forces by opening infantry fire in 
the broader area of Drnis and Benkovac, in the south of the 
R.S.K. 
  Croatian forces have repeatedly violated the ceasefire 
agreement, which was signed before Christmas and extended twice 
since then. The latest ceasefire violation indicates that Zagreb 
has not given up attempts to resolve disputed issues with the 
R.S.K. by force. 
  The R.S.K. was set up in 1991 on Serb ethnic and historical 
territories in the former Yugoslav republic of Croatia in 
response to Croatia's forcible secession from the former 
Yugoslav Federation and its violations of Serbs' human and 
national rights.

<F P=106> [Report by Danko Peric from Knin] </F>
  [Text] The third extension of the cease-fire agreement 
reached by Krajina and Croatia is also marked by violations in 
the border regions. The Croatian Army carried out attacks 
toward the Gracac part of Mount Velebit and infiltrated a 
subversive group in the Teslingrad front. According to the 
general staff of the Serbian army of Krajina, the Croatian 
subversive group that was infiltrated north of Teslingrad in 
Lika was neutralized. 
  In the last 24 hours, the Croatian Army carried out attacks 
with infantry weapons and tanks on Zitnik near Drnis, Otisic in 
the Vrlika region, and the free part of the village of Kasic 
near Benkovac. 
  It was somewhat quieter around Otocac, where the Krajina and 
the Croatian commissions for exchange of war prisoners and other 
humanitarian issues met under the auspices of UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces]. They agreed on the next exchange, which will 
take place in 15 days, and exhumation at several hitherto 
unknown locations where soldiers and civilian victims of the war 
are buried. They also agreed that exchange include the persons 
who, as stated, committed classical types of crime. This 
cooperation under the mediation of foreign observers is thus 
assuming a new quality.

  [Text] The press center of the general staff of the Serbian 
army of Krajina issued a communique on the situation on the 
battlefields in the last 24 hours stating that the Croatian 
forces, which temporarily captured the Lisac elevation in Lika 
yesterday, have been pushed out. The Lisac elevation had been 
under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] control until yesterday. 
In contrast to the Croatian fighters, who tried to carry out 
yet another attack in the zone under the UN protection -- which 
was thwarted -- the members of the Serbian army of Krajina did 
not suffer any casualties in the counterattack. 
  The violation of the cease-fire agreement by the Croatian 
Army is again taking place in Lika, mainly around Teslingrad and 
Plasko, where they used infantry weapons. 
  Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serbian Krajina, 
sent greetings to the wounded on 5 March, the day of the wounded 
of the latest war. Our care for the wounded is permanent. No 
one should forget you, the Krajina president said. The meeting 
with the wounded was organized by the people working for the 
Captain Dragan Fund.

  [Text] Tuzla, Bosnia, March 7 (AFP) -- Swedish and Danish 
soldiers of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) took 
over control Monday of the airport of Tuzla in northern Bosnia 
from Bosnian government troops. 
  They were to start preparing the airport for the reception 
of 
humanitarian aid flights following a weekend agreement by 
besieging Serbs to allow two air corridors into Tuzla. 
  Some 100 Swedish troops backed by armoured vehicles, 
including six Danish-crewed Leopard tanks, entered the base at 
1:30 p.m. (1230 GMT) to replace the last elements of the 
mainly-Moslem Bosnian army. 
  Earlier half-a-dozen Moslem trucks had left the airport 
carrying troops, documents and other equipment. 
  The 2,400 metre (3,000 yard) runways, which can take heavy 
transport aircraft, are within range of Serb artillery, but the 
airport has not been shelled since last week.

  [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, this afternoon talked to Yasushi 
Akashi, the UN secretary general's special envoy for the area of 
the former Yugoslavia. The talks were also attended by member 
of the Presidency Ejup Ganic and Army General Rasim Delic. 
Coming up is Nedzad Leko's report. 
  [Leko] Following today's talks, it was Yasushi Akashi who 
spoke to reporters first. He expressed satisfaction with the 
fact that the situation in Sarajevo had improved considerably 
since his last visit on 20 February. I can see that people are 
happier, more relaxed, Mr. Akashi added. As for the talks he 
said: 
  [Begin Akashi recording in English fading to Serbo-Croatian 
translation] We discussed how best to restore important public 
services in Sarajevo. General Rose, in cooperation with Bosnian 
Army Commander Gen. Rasim Delic, has already done a lot in that 
respect. He has drawn up a list of priorities for restoring 
electricity, water and gas supplies, and opening roads. We will 
continue working in that direction. As you know, the UN 
secretary general has been asked to send a report on this to the 
Security Council in seven days. We are preparing that report, 
and as far as the restoration of services in Sarajevo is 
concerned, we will work closely with the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Government. 
  We also reviewed the military situation, which is 
particularly tense in Maglaj, while the situation in other towns 
such as Mostar and Vitez has improved somewhat. As you know, I 
visited those towns last week and the cease-fire is holding, 
although it is occasionally violated. 
  We also discussed the opening of Tuzla airport, where some 
issues are still open. I promised UNPROFOR's [UN Protection 
Forces] full cooperation in improving the situation further and 
in strengthening peace, but, as you know, we need additional 
forces, reinforcements. 
  President Izetbegovic expressed his confidence in UNPROFOR 
as 
a neutral and unbiased force, which acts on behalf of the whole 
of the international community, and I am grateful to him for 
that. [end recording] 
  Akashi answered several journalists' questions. Speaking 
about when roads will be opened, he said that a special 
committee -- which will be headed by Bosnian Presidency member 
Ejup Ganic on the Bosnian side, and by Gen. Rose on the UNPROFOR 
side -- will review it. They will establish specific details of 
when and how, and whether all roads can be opened simultaneously. 
  Answering a question about the convoy for Maglaj, Akashi 
could not say when the convoy would leave because UNPROFOR has 
no troops deployed in the area. He stressed that UNPROFOR was 
very concerned about the situation there because air-drops are 
the only way to send food, but only 40 percent of food reaches 
those for whom it is intended. Akashi could neither confirm nor 
deny the reports on this morning's bombing of Maglaj by Serb 
aircraft. He said that, since he had been travelling all day, 
he had received no information about it from NATO. 
  Journalists wanted to know when Tuzla airport would be 
opened. Akashi said: 
  [Begin Akashi recording in English fading to Serbo-Croatian 
translation] Of course, I hope that Tuzla airport will be opened 
as soon as possible. The airport is good, but it needs to be 
improved, and some parts need to be repaired. We also have to 
provide additional equipment. However, problems at the moment 
are more of a political nature rather than technical. I would 
like the airport to be opened as a result of a general 
consensus, and this is why I am holding very intensive talks 
with the interested parties. However, there are still certain 
problems that need to be overcome. [end recording] 
  [Leko] The press were then addressed by Alija Izetbegovic. 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] As you can see, we discussed a 
large number of issues today. It is my impression that we made 
some progress on each of these issues, on some to a greater 
extent, on others to a lesser extent. I believe that very soon 
we are going to have a far better situation regarding power, 
gas, and water supplies in Sarajevo. We also expect that these 
roads in Sarajevo will open very soon. We also expect Tuzla 
airport to be opened in the near future. There are some minor 
difficulties that ought to be resolved. They are of a 
political, not of a technical nature. Our talks today focussed 
on Maglaj. We will send a letter to the Security Council this 
evening again, on the basis of our talks. We also asked Mr. 
Akashi and Gen. Rose to enable us to visit Srebrenica and 
Gorazde. I believe that the problem of Gorazde will be solved 
very soon, perhaps in a few days. We will have to wait a bit 
longer for Srebrenica, but I believe that this will also be 
solved successfully. [end recording]

  [Text] Russian troops ought to stay in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
within the UN mission and our country has nothing against this, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency member Ejup Ganic told a special 
correspondent of the Russian newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA today. 
  But the manner in which they arrived and the manifestation 
[as heard] organized on their arrival by Karadzic's Serbs 
irritated the people of our country, he stressed. Ganic 
believes the Russian troops in Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina 
should be mixed with all other UN forces in our country and not 
only be deployed along the front lines. Their task is to take 
part in safeguarding traffic routes and protecting convoys, in 
administrative work, and so forth. Anything else could bring 
about a situation whereby their impartiality, as members of the 
UN troops, is jeopardized, Ganic believes. 
  Karadzic wanted to present the arrival of the Russian troops 
as his triumph, so the arrival of 400 Russian soldiers was 
announced as a Russian invasion. This is a double game by the 
Pale leadership, which wants to drag Russia and its diplomats 
into a dishonest game and to confront it with the rest of the 
world, Ganic said. Bosnia-Herzegovina's long-term interest is 
in cooperation with Russia, this cannot be just a Serb privilege. 
  We would like to see the commander of the Russian contingent 
at talks with the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency. This could 
certainly contribute toward improving relations on the ground, 
Ganic concluded.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 5 (AFP) -- Ceasefires in Sarajevo 
and central Bosnia continued broadly to hold Saturday [5 March], 
but concern grew in particular over a warning by the head of the 
Moslem-led Bosnian army of possible "incidents" if Russian 
troops deploy around the enclave of Tuzla. 
  General Rasim Delic said the Bosnian army had "no 
confidence" 
in the neutrality of Russian troops and did not want to see them 
deployed, even as observers, in line with a UN plan to reopen 
Tuzla airport. People were "irritated with things they (the 
Russians) have done. Some incidents could happen and it has to 
be avoided," Delic said. Twenty-five Russian experts arrived in 
Zagreb Friday en route for Tuzla, where they are to visit the 
airport in preparation for Russian deployment. 
  In an interview with AFP, the commander of the Bosnian army 
said the besieged mainly Moslem population in Tuzla mistrusted 
the UN idea of deploying Russian troops there, viewing the 
Russians as allies of the Serbs. Delic said the airport at 
Tuzla was Bosnian property and that the Bosnian government 
should be able to decide who was based there. "We're not asking 
for some special troops but we don't want the Russians," Delic 
said, also rejecting the idea of Russian observers, if that were 
proposed instead of armed soldiers. 
  The United Nations has said it will start using Tuzla 
airport 
this month to boost the humanitarian aid effort in central 
Bosnia. Serb forces besiege almost half a million people in 
Tuzla and have bombed the airport several times in recent weeks. 
  The Russian experts are to visit the airport, which Bosnian 
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev said Tuesday in Moscow they had agreed to reopen after 
almost two year's closure. 
  Bosnian government officials have already protested the 
deployment of 400 Russian UN troops behind Serb lines in 
Sarajevo. 
  Meanwhile ceasefires were holding broadly, UN officials 
said. 
But UN peacekeepers admitted problems pinpointing the origins of 
the sporadic shellfire that fell within the NATO-imposed 
exclusion zone around the Bosnian capital. 
  Two mortars shells fell overnight Friday near the 
UN-controlled Sarajevo airport, without causing casualties, said 
UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Major Rob Annink. The 
incident was the latest breach of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation's heavy weapons exclusion zone set up 20-kilometres 
(12-miles) around Sarajevo. 
  UN Bosnian Commander General Sir Michael Rose on Friday 
repeated his urgent appeal for more UN troops to be sent to 
Bosnia to help enforce the ceasefires, warning continued 
ceasefire breaches threatened to topple the fragile peace 
process. The British general has called for at least 5,000 more 
troops to reinforce the 13,000 UNPROFOR soldiers already in 
Bosnia. 
  Meanwhile, five 122-mm howitzers discovered inside the 
Sarajevo exclusion zone Thursday have been driven out by the 
Serbs, UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink said, adding that a sixth 
was due to leave Saturday. The Serbs told UNPROFOR that they 
considered that the weapons, discovered at Cifluk, 19 kilometres 
from Sarajevo, were outside the exclusion zone. 
  In central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina British and 
Canadian UN troops were due Saturday to deploy along the 
confrontation lines between government soldiers and Bosnian 
Croat forces. UNPROFOR planned to inspect 350 kilometres of 
front lines, mainly in the areas around Vitez, Mostar, Gorni 
Vakuf, Prozor, Konijc and Jablanica. The opening of six aid 
routes through the front lines were also to be negotiated. 
  Under the terms of a Croat-Moslem ceasefire which came into 
force late last month, all HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and 
Bosnian army checkpoints are to be dismantled or placed under UN 
control.

  [Text] Army General Rasim Delic, chief of the general staff 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, and Gen. Michael Rose, UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] Commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, had 
talks in Sarajevo today. The two commanders discussed the 
dynamism of the implementation of the cease-fire agreement, 
signed between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO [Croatian 
Defense Council] transition from a war to a peace situation in 
the city of Sarajevo, as well as possibilities of UN 
representatives entering Maglaj. 
  Gen. Rose was optimistic in assessing the activity so far in 
the realization of the HVO-Bosnia-Herzegovina Army agreement, 
which he could see for himself during his visits to Old Vitez, 
Gornji Vakuf, and other parts of central Bosnia in the past few 
days. He pointed out the problems of implementing the agreement 
in the city of Sarajevo, where he expects a great deal of work 
in the near future. The Army and civil authorities are expected 
to make their contribution to this in cooperation with the 
UNPROFOR. 
  Army Gen. Delic said that Bosnia-Herzegovina Army units and 
commands were ready to carry out all the tasks laid down by the 
peace agreement with the HVO. The agreement is being 
implemented with success on the ground and there is room for 
optimism, said Army Gen. Delic. 
  As for the opening of Dubrave airport near Tuzla, the stands 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the state leadership are 
quite clear. We insist that the airport be opened, but I do not 
accept any Serb conditions regarding its opening. This is our 
free territory and there can be no discussion about the 
territory, which our army has liberated, stressed Army Gen. 
Delic at the end of the talks today.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 6 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb Foreign 
Minister Aleksa Buha said on Sunday that Bosnian Serbs would 
never agree to a federal Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Speaking at the day of Orthodox and Slav unity event 
organised in central Belgrade by the international Serbian 
community and the Belgrade-based non-governmental White Rose 
anti-racist organization, Buha said that the international 
community was advocating "a dual plan of a federation and 
confederation," instead of trying to separate Bosnia's three 
warring nations which can no longer live together. 
  Under strong U.S. pressure, Bosnian Croats and Moslems 
signed 
an agreement last Tuesday undertaking to form a Moslem-Croat 
federation in the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and subsequently enter into a loose 
confederation with neighbouring Croatia. 
  "The Croats and Moslems cam unite without us, if they want 
to, but they cannot unite against us," said Buha and added there 
could certainly be "no return to any sovereign and integral 
Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  The concept of Moslem-Croat federation is intended by 
Washington to make it possible for the Moslems to preserve an 
integral Bosnia-Herzegovina, enlarge the territory under their 
control and gain access to the sea. Last, but not least, it 
should create a firm negotiating and, possibly military, bloc 
against the Bosnian Serbs. 
  President of the White Rose organization Radomir Smiljanic 
said that the "Serbs are demonstrating their desire for a speedy 
signing of just peace for Bosnia-Herzegovina" and added that the 
day of Orthodox and Slav unity was being held simultaneously in 
all world capitals which have Serb communities. 
  "The world has met with Islamization, Germanization, 
conversion to Roman Catholicism, but it has never heard of 
conversion to Orthodox Christianity, because nothing like that 
has even been practiced," Smiljanic said. He added that "Serbs 
have never in their history waged crusades, they have only 
defended their peace and freedom."

<F P=106> [Interview with Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian </F>
Serbs, by an unidentified reporter; place and date not given: 
"Pushed Under the Russian Wing"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] For the first time NATO has enforced 
the no-fly zone over Bosnia by force. Has this blow taught the 
Serbs to be afraid? 
  [Karadzic] NATO's interference in our crisis is a disaster. 
NATO is clearly anti-Serbian, and threats directed one-sidedly 
against us will not lead to peace. No organization is 
legitimated to supplant the United Nations. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] However, the United Nations has proved to be 
incapable of dealing with the crisis and has not been able to 
implement any resolutions. 
  [Karadzic] Then the United Nations must reinforce its 
troops. Such a mission must not be left to a block pursuing its 
own interests. NATO, which has long become obsolete since the 
dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, has made use of the weakness of 
the United Nations and is now acting completely on its own. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But giving the order for an operation still 
rests with the UN commanders on site. 
  [Karadzic] NATO was determined to shoot also without an 
order. The Western alliance had the need to do so. Therefore, 
Boris Yeltsin asked me and President Milosevic to give in. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is it not becoming increasingly likely that 
there will be a new Yalta in the Balkans, with Serbia falling 
into the Russians' sphere of interests? 
  [Karadzic] The Russian culture, the Russian people and its 
religion are very close to us. However, when we are pushed 
under the Russian wing in political terms, this is just the 
fault of the West. It has proved to be merciless and aggressive 
toward our people. We are in a situation where one cannot 
choose one's friends. If Russia offers to protect our rights, 
we cannot refuse this. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You have just been to Moscow. Did President 
Yeltsin promise you any specific help if there was a further 
escalation between Serbs and NATO? 
  [Karadzic] Of course, Russia will not permit NATO to 
dominate the Balkans. Nor can Moscow have any interest in 
letting the conflict spread to Greece, Turkey, or Albania. By 
the way -- we can defend ourselves. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] President Yeltsin has suggested a peace 
conference with the big five: the United States, Russia, 
France, Britain, and Germany. Would you participate in such a 
conference and sign a peace plan worked out there? 
  [Karadzic] This conference would have to be prepared well. 
All three sides would have to make sacrifices. The final 
outcome should be an international peace treaty similar to the 
one of Versailles in 1919 that sets down the new borders. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And what should these borders be like? 
  [Karadzic] Our idea was the formation of a Muslim state in 
Bosnia with 33.3 percent of the territory. This is enough to 
survive. There are smaller states. We wanted to exchange 
territories with Croatia. As a result, the Serbs would not have 
gotten everything and the Croats would not have lost everything. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In the meantime, an agreement between Bosnian 
Muslims and Croats has been achieved, who want to form a joint 
federation and then plan to establish a confederation with 
Croatia. Will the Bosnian Serbs join this model? 
  [Karadzic] Only political illiterates could expect us to do 
that. We lived in the so-called Croatian-Muslim state in World 
War II. At that time hundreds of thousands of Serbs were killed 
under German protection under German protection. For us there 
can only be an independent Serbian state in Bosnia or the 
unification of the Bosnian Serbs with all other Serbs in one 
state. Anything else would be unnatural.

<F P=106> [Article by Michael Adler] </F>
  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, March 7 (AFP) -- Bosnian Moslem and 
Croatian troops were working Monday to meet a noon deadline to 
withdraw heavy weapons fom some 350 kilometres (210 miles) of 
front lines as part of a ceasefire accord. 
  The accord, signed last week in Washington and part of an 
overall agreement between both sides to form a loose federation, 
calls for mortars to be pulled back 10 kilometres (six miles) 
from front lines in southern and central Bosnia and tanks and 
artillery 20 kilometres (12 miles). All other heavy weapons are 
to be placed under UN control. 
  The ceasefire, patterned after a similar truce for Sarajevo, 
has generally been holding well with only sporadic incidents 
reported, UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman Major Jose 
Labandeira said Monday. He said Croat HVO [Croatian Defense 
Council] forces began to withdraw heavy weapons from the 
southern town of Mostar and the central town of Kiseljak on 
Sunday and that several artillery pieces had been handed over at 
UN collection sites. 
  The Bosnian Army had also marked minefields between Kiseljak 
and Bosovaca, Labandeira said. "The HVO and BIH (Bosnian Army) 
continue to cooperate very well," he said. 
  The two former allies began fighting last May when the 
Croats 
moved to carve a separate state for themselves in southwest 
Bosnia. They agreed to sign the U.S.-brokered truce last week 
in a bid to isolate Bosnia's Serb faction at peace talks and end 
a two-year war that has claimed some 200,000 lives. [passage 
omitted] 
  Meanwhile in Sarajevo a nearly monthlong ceasefire was 
holding Monday despite continued fighting in one stubborn 
pocket. UNPROFOR spokesman Captain Niels Otto Pedersen said the 
main battlefront in Bosnia had moved to the northerwestern town 
of Maglaj which was undergoing heavy Serb shelling according to 
British UN troops stationed nearby. 
  The Serbs were also continuing to block humanitarian aid 
from 
reaching the city, UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
spokesman Kris Janowski told reporters. He said that even if 
current NATO airdrops of food worked perfectly, which is not the 
case, this would meet only half the food needs of the city's 
population of 16,000. "I know the human situation is critical" 
in Maglaj, Janowski said. 
  In other developments, Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha 
af 
Ugglas arrived in Zagreb on Monday to meet with Croatian and UN 
officials before heading to Sarajevo on Tuesday. Sweden has 
peacekeeping troops deployed in Sarajevo and the northern town 
of Tuzla, where the UN is to take control of the airport so that 
humanitarian aid can be flown in to the Serb-besieged town. 
  Bosnian Serb officials agreed Sunday to the creation of two 
air-corridors into Tuzla, where Russian military observers are 
to be deployed to ensure that no military equipment reaches the 
Moslems.

  [Text] The Serb aggressors have continued an offensive on 
the Usora area (northern Bosnia), the local command of the 
Croatian Defense Council [HVO] reported on Sunday. The Serb 
forces fired three howitzer shells at civilian targets in the 
village of Jelah destroying several residential buildings on 
Sunday morning, the same source said. The HVO units managed to 
repel a severe artillery-supported infantry attack of the Serb 
aggressors in the area of Glavasi-Kriz-Komin on the western part 
of the Usora battlefield last night, whereas on the eastern part 
of the crisis area the Serb forces failed to carry out an 
infantry breakthrough in the region of 
Cerici-Razbjenjak-Makljanovac at the same time. The enemy 
forces opened antiaircraft weaponry and mortar fire all the 
night on the Usora battlefield, said the same source. Thus far 
one HVO soldier has been reported to be gravely wounded. The HVO 
reconnaissance troops noticed last night a concentration of the 
Serb aggressors' forces and artillery on the western part of the 
Usora battlefield. Another offensive of the enemy formations is 
being expected last few days.

  [Text] We've just heard that French UN troops again came 
under attack last night in Sarajevo in what they described as a 
deliberate Serb attack. Luc Lemonnier has this report from 
Sarajevo: 
  [Lemonnier] The incident once again took place at the Jewish 
cemetery, close to the center of Sarajevo, in the hills where 
Serbs and Muslims are separated by only a few dozen meters. A 
detachment of French UN troops is also in this frontline sector. 
Earlier in the week they had already returned fire against the 
Serbs with their heavy machine-guns. Last night, just after 
2000, they were the targets of deliberate fire, which a 
high-ranking UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] official said came 
from Bosnian Serb lines. The French soldiers returned fire for 
a few minutes with their machine guns, and one French soldier 
was injured by splinters of stone during the clash. Such 
incidents are a daily occurrence in Sarajevo, especially in the 
evening, and Generals Cot and Rose warned two days ago that 
without a significant increase in UN troop numbers, such 
incidents could end up threatening the cease-fire and the whole 
peace process.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 5 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem forces 
launched mortar attacks on Serb settlements and army positions 
around Sarajevo in the night between Friday and Saturday despite 
a cease-fire which came into force on February 10, the Bosnian 
Serb Army said in a statement. 
  On Friday and on Saturday, the Moslems opened cannon, 
mortar, 
anti-aircraft and small arms fire on Serb settlements and army 
positions in the areas of Doboj, Teslic, Maglaj and Mt. Ozren in 
northern Bosnia, the statement added. 
  It also said that regular troops of the Republic of Croatia 
had not withdrawn from Bosnia-Herzegovina although the deadline 
set by the U.N. Security Council expired on February 17. 
  On February 3, the Security Council threatened to introduce 
sanctions against Croatia unless it withdrew its regular troops 
from Bosnia. 
  From the outset of the Bosnian war nearly two years ago, the 
Croatian Army supported the local Croat and Moslem forces in 
their war against local Serbs. Since early 1993, however, 
Croatia's regular troops and Bosnian Croat forces have been 
fighting pitched battles with Bosnian Moslems for territories in 
central and southern Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Report by Hajrudin Fermic from Maglaj] </F>
  [Text] Although a cease-fire between the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army and the Serbian aggressor's side in order to exchange 
soldiers' remains was agreed upon and should have come into 
effect at 0700 this morning, the chetniks have fiercely attacked 
the defenders of Maglaj. 
  The attacks were directed at the positions of the fighters 
of 
the 201st Brigade in the Bijela Ploca-(Herdovace) region with 
the substantial support of tanks, mortars, guns, and 
self-propelled antiaircraft artillery [praga]. The chetniks 
also attempted an infantry breakthrough. However, the situation 
is most difficult for the civilian population of Maglaj which is 
being exposed to constant artillery activities. 
  A general alarm was again sounded at 0830 this morning. The 
shelling of Maglaj lasted throughout yesterday and overnight -- 
first came aircraft bombs and then attacks from howitzers, 
tanks, mortars, and Bofors guns. More than 500 shells have been 
fired, killing four civilians and injuring nine.

  [Text] We have received a statement from the press center 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army saying that combat planes 
belonging to the Serb aggressor attacked the free territory of 
Maglaj at 0500 this morning. In the bestial bombing, the 
chetniks destroyed the old bridge in Maglaj. 
  The headquarters of the supreme command of the Army of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina immediately informed the UN 
command for Bosnia-Herzegovina about the situation in Maglaj. 
At 1015, the Serb aggressor's combat planes again attacked Old 
Maglaj, and at the same time chetnik units launched a fierce 
combined tank and infantry attack. Soldiers of the 201st Knight 
Brigade of the Bosnia-Herzegovina army successfully repelled the 
attack. In preparation for a fresh tank and infantry attack, 
with air force support, the chetniks are regrouping their forces 
while still attacking the town of Maglaj. 
  Army General Rasim Delic, commander of the headquarters of 
the supreme command of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, informed 
General Michael Rose [UN Protection Forces commander for Bosnia] 
personally about the attacks by the Serb air force on Maglaj and 
demanded that NATO planes take more effective action to stop the 
bombing of Maglaj, which is primarily aimed at civilian targets 
and infrastructure. General Rose promised urgent intervention 
by NATO forces to protect the air space above Maglaj. This is 
what was said in a statement of the press center of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 6 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb aircraft 
did not bomb Moslem-held Maglaj on Sunday morning, Bosnian Serb 
military sources said. 
  The Moslem forces which control this northern Bosnian town 
are burning piles of tyres to make it look as if the town is in 
smoke after an air raid, the sources said. 
  Moslem-controlled Radio Sarajevo alleged on Sunday that 
Bosnian Serb aircraft had destroyed the bridge across the River 
Bosna which bisects Maglaj, and Moslem army commander Gen. Rasim 
Delic has requested the commander of the U.N. Protection Force 
in Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose, to order "an immediate 
intervention" by the NATO air force. 
  The NATO Command for Southern Europe in Naples, Italy, on 
Sunday denied that Bosnian Serb aircraft had violated the "no 
fly" zone over Bosnia. 
  NATO Spokesman in Naples John Jeffrey said NATO had no 
information about any violation of Bosnian air space and could 
not confirm that Maglaj had been raided from the air. 
  REUTERS, Mega and Antenne 1 television crews have filmed 
Moslem assaults on the eastern slopes of Mt Ozren and the 
situation in nearby Maglaj, and the footage showed the town to 
be quiet. 
  Bosnian Serb military sources said that the Moslem 
allegation 
of a Serb raid on Maglaj was designed to draw attention away 
from Moslem offensives in the north -- in the areas of Mt Ozren, 
Trebava and Doboj, and in the Bosna river valley. 
  The Bosnian Serb army said in a statement that a Moslem 
sabotage unit from Tesanj had blown up the iron bridge in Maglaj 
in order to prevent Moslem civilians from crossing to the right 
bank of the Bosna and fleeing to Moslem-held Zenica in central 
Bosnia, under an agreement with the Bosnian Serb army.

  [Excerpts] This morning, the chetniks again launched air 
attacks on the Maglaj area. They really want to cause a final 
show-down with NATO forces. 
  The chetniks are continuing the offensive on Maglaj, using 
all weapons and targeting everything. [passage omitted] 
  The aggressors tried to use aircraft again at 0915 GMT but 
failed to achieve the desired result. They let out their rage 
on civilians in the town, dropping tonnes of their deadly load. 
Howitzers, mortars, and tanks are pounding the town, and they 
have fired more than 400 shells on residential areas. We have 
learned that three civilians have been killed and six wounded. 
The shelling of Maglaj is going on as I speak. The best 
witnesses to the intensity of the shelling are NATO pilots who 
have been actively patrolling the air space above Maglaj since 
0900 GMT. 
  The war presidency of the Maglaj municipality has sent a 
request to Michael Rose [UN commander for Bosnia] to immediately 
dispatch UN Protection Force units to Maglaj to stop the further 
killing of civilians and protect material goods from the bestial 
shelling.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, March 6 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb 
warplanes twice attacked the northern Moslem enclave of Maglaj 
on Sunday [6 March], Radio Sarajevo reported, but NATO officials 
in Italy said they had no reports of a UN flight ban over Bosnia 
being breached. [passage omitted] 
  In Naples, a spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation denied the Bosnia "no-fly" order had been breached 
Sunday [6 March]. U.S. Major John Jeffrey said the Western 
military alliance had received no reports of an attack on 
Maglaj. Any breach of the flight ban would have led to a NATO 
riposte, he said. An Italian spokesman for NATO told AFP: "As 
far as we are concerned nothing happened." 
  Maglaj, whose pre-war population of 19,000 was 45 percent 
Moslem, has been besieged by the Serbs for eight months and its 
residents are said to be living in appalling conditions. Sadic 
said that 11 people were killed and 24 others recently when the 
town's hospital was shelled.

  [Text] Doboj, March 7 (TANJUG) -- A Muslim offensive 
against Serb positions and settlements continues in the region 
of Doboj in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina, where Serb troops have 
repelled four strong Musllim attacks, Bosnian Serb military 
sources said on Monday. 
  The Muslim offensive operations have been the strongest in 
the area of Mounts Ozren and Trebava, south of Doboj, where the 
arrival of fresh Muslim troops has been observed, the same 
sources said. 
  The Muslim side carried out three infantry attacks in the 
Mount Ozren area north-east of Zavidovici in an attempt to make 
a breakthrough and link up with Muslim troops south of Doboj. 
  Serb troops took effective action and repelled the three 
attacks and also an attempted infantry breakthrough east of 
Zavidovici, forcing the enemy to return to the starting 
positions. 
  All Serb settlements in the north-eastern part of Mount 
Ozren 
are a constant target of Muslim snipers, the Bosnian Serb 
military sources said. 
  Muslim forces kept on opening fire from infantry weapons all 
along the frontline in the area of Brcko in northern Bosnia- 
Herzegovina on the night of March 6-7. 
  Bosnian Muslim army commander Rasim Delic on Saturday said 
his troops would launch new operations against the Bosnian 
Serbs. He set out that, having signed the Washington agreement 
on a federation with the Bosnian Croats, the Muslims had one 
front less now and extra forces, the size of a few (?brigades), 
to send to the front against the Serbs. 
  Muslim forces from the region of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia- 
Herzegovina resumed attacks on Serb defence lines in the areas 
of Ustikolina and Cajnice on the night of March 6-7. 
  Although Gorazde is a U.N.-proclaimed Muslim "safe area," 
which was to be demilitarized, Muslim units from that area 
continue to engage in combat and even to try to get their 
commando-terrorist groups behind Serb lines, Bosnian Serb 
military sources said.

  [Text] Zagreb, March 5 (AFP) -- Thirty-two wounded were 
evacuated Saturday [5 March] from the besieged Moslem sector of 
the southern Bosnia-Herzegovina city of Mostar on Saturday, 
witnesses said. 
  The wounded and some 47 family members were taken to Citluk, 
around 20 kilometres (12 miles) south of Mostar, in Spanish UN 
Protection Force vehicles, before being flown to the Croatian 
port of Split on British helicopters, said journalists. 
  They were due to be flown to the Italian military base of 
Ancona where they are to be taken to a transit centre before 
flying on to hospitals in Britain, Denmark, Italy, Spain, the 
United States and the United Arab Emirates. 
  The evacuation comes after a ceasefire between the 
Moslem-dominated Bosnian army and Bosnian Croat forces came into 
effect February 25. 
  Some 55,000 Moslems are holed up in the shattered remains of 
eastern Mostar, battered by 11 months of shelling from Croat 
forces camped in the western districts of the historic city.

  [Excerpt] The Bihac area is stoically resisting a heavy 
chetnik offensive. The enemy's long-range artillery has not been 
quiet today, the 28th day of the aggressor's offensive against 
the Bihac region. Artillery and tank attacks on the defense 
lines on Hacin Vrh and Vrsak and on Cazin have intensified since 
midday. The chetniks also launched fresh attacks on the Grmusa 
plateau, where fierce fighting is under way as I am filing this 
report. 
  At the same time artillery attacks on the fringes of Cazin 
have been intensified. Several howitzer shells have fallen in 
the area of the town while the suburbs on the right bank of the 
river Una have been continuously shelled all day. According to 
unofficial reports there are several casualties. [passage

  [Text] The attacks by chetnik howitzers, tanks, and mortars 
of all calibers on the lines of defenders in the part of the 
front around Bihac and on Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau have 
continued throughout the night and up to this moment. Fierce 
battles were fought on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau early this 
morning, where, after ferocious artillery preparation, the 
chetniks considerably intensified attacks on all lines. 
  The defenders -- members of the 5th Corps of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army -- responded adamantly, defending every 
inch of territory. Following the established scenario, the 
Serbian aggressor also intensified artillery attacks on Bihac 
and Cazin and their outskirts. 
  There have been many injured and killed civilians in this 
savage artillery attack on Bihac; however, due to current 
hellish situation in this town and throughout the entire Bihac 
district, we do not have definitive reports about this. At the 
time of reporting, fierce shelling of the settlements on the 
right bank of Una River and of the two aforementioned towns is 
underway.

  [Text] Army General Rasim Delic, the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army commander in chief, spoke about the current military 
situation in our country at a public debate hosted by the 
Council of the Bosnian Intellectuals' Congress today. 
  Gen. Delic spoke about the creation and the strengthening of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, stressing that the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army had gained considerable strength in a 
short period of time thanks to the existence of organized 
patriotic forces. The creation of such a military force, 
according to Delic, thwarted the goals of the aggression: The 
creation of Greater Serbia, the occupation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the complete annihilation of the Muslim 
nation. 
  The Tudjman-Milosevic and Karadzic-Boban agreements should 
have served the enemy in the realization of its goals. For the 
Serbs they only represented Phase One in the creation of Greater 
Serbia. Following the signing of these agreements, the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army began fighting two aggressors. The 
front with the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] was still to be 
established. The HVO had blockaded roads and thwarted the 
dispatch of humanitarian aid. 
  Even though the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army had lost some 
important positions in that period -- Grebak, Trnovo, and Zepce 
-- Delic stressed, HVO forces were completely eliminated on the 
territory of Jablanica, Kakanj, Zenica, Travnik, and Bugojno. 
The HVO was defeated militarily and would have completely 
disappeared had not Croatia sent in its huge forces, Delic said. 
  A military balance with the forces of the Serb aggressor has 
been established. The enemy launched several offensives over 
the past few months -- against Teocak, Olovo, Bihac, and Maglaj 
-- but did not succeed in shifting our defense lines. Huge 
losses in manpower and equipment were inflicted on it. On some 
parts of the battlefield our forces even advanced. 
  According to Gen. Delic, results of strategic importance 
achieved by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army are: The thwarting of 
the occupation, the survival of the people, the opening up of 
roads, and the strengthening of the political reputation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in the world. The agreement reached with the 
Republic of Croatia should be regarded in this light. The 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army gained a lot by this agreement -- it no 
longer has to fight two enemies. The opening up of roads is 
also of great importance. 
  Speaking about the situation in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, 
Delic said this was an army in which military hierarchy was 
respected. The Army was cleansed of crime and paramilitary 
formations. He particularly stressed that good cooperation with 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Internal Affairs Ministry existed. 
According to Delic, Internal Affairs Ministry forces and the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army represent a united defense factor of our 
country. It is necessary to continue the strengthening of the 
Army regarding its organization and cadres, because there will 
more fighting, Rasim Delic said.

<F P=106> [Interview by F.B. with Mustafa Ceric, "spiritual leader of </F>
the Bosnian Muslims," in Sarajevo; date not given: "You Have 
Handed Us Over to the Russians"] 
  [Text] Mustafa Ceric, 42 years old, is venerated in 
Sarajevo with the title "Leader of the Wise Men." He is the 
highest religious authority in Bosnia. The Muslim faithful turn 
to him like Catholics to the pope. He received us at the 
"Careva Djamija," the city's oldest mosque, built on the banks 
of the Milijecka by Isak Isakovic in 1461, one year before the 
Turks occupied Sarajevo. 
  [F.B.] NATO has not bombed the hills around Sarajevo. The 
Serbs are controlled by the UN forces. How do Muslims feel 
about this result of the ultimatum? 
  [Ceric] I do not know what NATO has done for us in 22 
months. 
I do know, however, that we now have a double occupation. 
First, there was only the Serbian occupation. Now there is 
also the occupation by the Russians, who came solely to legalize 
what the Serbs have accomplished. In fact, they have 
consolidated the partition of the city. Therefore, thanks to 
the United Nations and NATO our position has worsened. Now we 
are slaves forced to live in a ghetto. The reason for this lies 
in the fact that as far as the international community is 
concerned the true problem does not lie with the Serbs, but with 
the Muslims. 
  [F.B.] That is a harsh opinion, one which combines pessimism 
with ill feeling. 
  [Ceric] We have survived so far, and we will survive in the 
future. However, Europe and the world have bound our hands, and 
now they are obliged to untie them. They have stopped 
blackmailing us with humanitarian aid and pushing us to 
surrender. We will not commit suicide. Therefore, I am neither 
pessimistic nor optimistic. I am realistic and I know that if we 
had been animals instead of human beings, the world would have 
taken a greater interest in our cause. 
  [F.B.] Just a few days ago, French President Mitterrand 
forcefully defended you. 
  [Ceric] Mitterrand should stop talking about human rights: 
Rather, give us arms to survive. We know the Serbs well and we 
know how they have to be treated. 
  [F.B.] Many people in the West fear an Islamic state. 
  [Ceric] Why? We have no fear of Christianity. We Bosnians 
are used to living in a pluralistic and diverse society. 
Believe me when I say that I truly wish the Bosnians were 
fundamentalists so that we could find the strength and cohesion 
needed to fight. 
  [F.B.] What kind of model are you thinking of for the 
Bosnian 
state? 
  [Ceric] Nothing innovative. The models are those which are 
already known. They are all subject to international laws. For 
example, laws cannot be passed to institutionalize ethnic 
cleansing. We live according to the laws of the international 
community. That is not true of the Serbs. They have overturned 
the principles of morals. So the right question to ask is this: 
Is it possible not to be multicultural? Or not to live in an 
international context? That is the question which Europe must 
answer. 
  [F.B.] But? 
  [Ceric] But Europe is putting the aggressors and those who 
have been attacked on the same level. However, if the world is 
unable to answer this question about the need to be 
multicultural, it will be the Serbs who bring their morals to 
the streets of Paris, Berlin, and London. And the question will 
arise as to whether the idea of a united, multinational, and 
multicultural Europe has not died right here in Sarajevo. 
  [F.B.] Many Muslims have fled Sarajevo. Will they return? 
  [Ceric] Anyone who has fled will return. War is not made up 
of soldiers alone. Often, the side effects are the most 
dramatic. Look at the UN soldiers who are here: They have no 
feeling for this land, they do not identify with the people, 
they do not see themselves in the culture. They are merely 
occupation troops. As for the humanitarian organizations, there 
is a legitimate suspicion that they want the war to continue. 
Indeed, for them the war has become the only reason for their 
existence.

<F P=106> [Report by ET-1 correspondent Dhimitrios Dheliolanis] </F>
  [Text] The 10 members of the Central European Initiative, 
which includes Italy, Austria and eight Eastern European 
countries, expressed here in Trieste, Italy, their deep concern 
about Greece's measures against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. At the same time, they called on 
both sides to continue negotiations in the United Nations. 
Following the end of the two-day ministerial meeting, Skopje 
Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski expressed his satisfaction 
with the communique and repeated his desire for dialogue with 
Greece. Asked if a goodwill gesture can be expected from 
Skopje, Crvenkovski replied: 
  [Begin recording, in English] [Crvenkovski] I think that our 
position is quite clear. We are absolutely for them and for 
continuing negotiations. We favor developing good relations 
between the two countries and we are strongly interested in 
obtaining good relations with.... 
  [Dheliolanis, interrupting] There will be some goodwill 
gesture on your part? 
  [Crvenkovski] There have been many goodwill gestures in the 
past few years and I think that now is the time to sit together 
at the table and continue negotiations in New York. I think the 
only way to solve any problems between the two countries is to 
sit together and talk. [end recording] 
  The Skopje minister, however, avoided answering a question 
about the thinking that led his country to adopt the Sun of 
Veryina as a symbol. Finally, in an interview with a local 
newspaper today, Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta 
said that he does not worry about Greece's anger with the 
planned transportation axis north of Greece.

<F P=106> [Report by J. Mironski: "No Justification for the Greek </F>
Measures"] 
  [Text] German Foreign Ministry Minister of State Helmut 
Scheffer and the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski held a 
news conference yesterday in which they emphasized their mutual 
interest in the further development of bilateral relations 
between the two countries. 
  Crvenkovski indicated that Scheffer's visit coincided with 
the embargo imposed by Greece against Macedonia, which was also 
a subject of the discussions. Minister Scheffer pointed out 
that he did not arrive in Macedonia as a mediator between Greece 
and Macedonia, but as a representative of a government of a 
member country of the European Union, which wanted to gain an 
insight into reactions in Macedonia and then transmit these 
impressions to its own government, and also to the Union. 
  He said: "My impression is that there is great tranquillity 
here concerning the development of events, without any 
demonstrative emotions about the Greek embargo. It is difficult 
for every state to make concessions under foreign pressures. 
That is why I consider the Greek measures to be wrong." 
Minister Scheffer also added: "Nobody in Europe wants the 
political isolation of Greece; it is part of Europe, but Greece 
must also admit that it should have agreed with its partners 
before taking these measures. The decision, which came without 
warning or reasons, was hard for everyone in Europe to 
understand." 
  "Greece must understand that it cannot make unilateral 
decisions without any reason," he said, and added: "I cannot 
find a single argument that Macedonia represents a threat for 
Greece; it is nothing but a fantasy. We cannot allow the 
borders in Europe to be changed by force. I do not believe that 
Macedonian integrity will be endangered, because it is 
impermissible to have another conflict on the territory of 
former Yugoslavia." 
  Concerning the Greek embargo and the damage suffered by 
Macedonia, Scheffer said: "Greece is losing a lot itself. 
Perhaps not as much as Macedonia, but it is. I do not see any 
reason why it should harm itself economically and politically. 
The embargo is a question that will have to be solved by the 
European Union, and the official German stance is that it has to 
be lifted immediately." He also emphasized that he would 
transmit his impressions to the Commissioner for Foreign Affairs 
of the Union Hans van den Brook, suggesting that negotiations 
should restart promptly, and he also pointed out that 
preliminary agreements should be organized. 
  Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski said that Scheffer's 
visit 
was of enormous importance, first of all for bilateral and 
economic cooperation between the two countries. An agreement 
was made about an exchange of experts to help companies restart 
the long cooperation that existed before the war in former 
Yugoslavia. A larger scientific and cultural cooperation was 
also subject of the discussions, and soon a German library is 
expected to open in Macedonia.

  [Text] Kiro Gligorov, president of Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --FYROM], on 3 March received 
Bulgarian Deputy Foreign Minister Dimitur Ikonomov, who paid a 
brief working visit to Skopje. Our correspondent in Skopje 
Kostadin Filipov reports. 
  [Begin Filipov recording] Dimitur Ikonomov conveyed to Mr. 
Gligorov a message from Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev, which 
was in response to a letter that the Macedonian head of state 
sent to Dr. Zhelev a week ago. 
  In his message to the Macedonian president, Dr. Zhelyu 
Zhelev 
expressed Bulgaria's willingness to further develop its friendly 
and goodneighborly relations with the Republic of Macedonia in 
all spheres -- economy, trade, culture, and so on -- on a 
constructive and principled basis. 
  Against the background of the complex political situation in 
this part of the Balkan peninsula, this is an expression of 
Bulgaria's willingness to help the Republic of Macedonia 
overcome the difficulties related to the tense relations between 
Macedonia and Greece. 
  The specific issues will apparently be specified at a later 
date by the appropriate organs and institutions of the two 
neighboring states. 
  This should by no means be interpreted as Bulgaria 
relinquishing its principled position of refusing to upset the 
balance of its relations with all states in the Balkan political 
space and supporting every step aimed at strengthening regional 
peace and stability. [end recording]

  [Text] Ljubljana, 7 Mar (TANJUG) -- The leader of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who, 
it has been learned, arrived in Slovenia this morning, has been 
held at Ljubljana's Brnik airport. 
  Slovene authorities are not allowing Zhirinovskiy to enter 
the country although the leader of the Russian Liberal Democrats 
has a valid diplomatic passport of the Russian Federation. 
  It is not clear whether the Slovene authorities will deny 
Zhirinovskiy entry, or whether they will let him stay, as is 
claimed, for a private visit to Slovenia.

  [Excerpt] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian 
Liberal Democratic Party, arrived from Moscow at Ljubljana 
airport on an Adria Airways aircraft last night. Together with 
his three companions, he was forced to spent the night at the 
airport as the Slovene immigration officials would not allow him 
entry. 
  In light of the experiences of his latest visit, 
Zhirinovskiy 
is supposedly persona non grata in our country. Zhirinovskiy 
lodged a protest with the immigration organs, while the Russian 
Embassy in Ljubljana has not reacted so far. 
  The Slovene border officials would not allow members of the 
press to come in contact with Zhirinovskiy. He is supposed to 
return to Moscow at 1355 today on a regular flight of the 
Russian carrier Aeroflot. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovene Defense Minister Janez Jansa by </F>
Teodor Marjanovic in Ljubljana; date not given: "At the Moment, 
We Are Not Threatened by War"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Marjanovic] You made a 
statement recently, according to which, at the time before 
Slovenia became a UN member and therefore did not feel itself 
bound by resolutions of that organization, arms shipments to 
Croatia and Bosnia were passing through its territory -- with 
the knowledge of the Slovene bodies. 
  [Jansa] No. I said that, at the time, Slovenia helped the 
two assaulted states, not by the permission to transfer weapons 
through our territory, but rather by providing them with some of 
the weapons expropriated from the Yugoslav People's Army. That 
assistance ended long before our country was recognized by the 
United Nations. 
  [Marjanovic] Slovenia, as one of the former Yugoslav 
republics, is still subject to the arms embargo. 
  [Jansa] The entity on which the embargo was imposed -- the 
former Yugoslavia -- no longer exists, and therefore the embargo 
should not apply to us. There has been no embargo imposed on 
Slovenia as an independent country. Nevertheless, it has been 
applied in practice. 
  [Marjanovic] Does it prevent your entry into the Partnership 
for Peace project? 
  [Jansa] We were told that it will not be a hindrance. 
Precisely, our joining the "Partnership" is a feasible way of 
leaving the entity on which the embargo was imposed. 
  [Marjanovic] Nonetheless, Slovene politics have not assumed 
a consistent stand regarding that project. 
  [Jansa] According to public opinion surveys, most of the 
citizens agree with our joining the "Partnership." That is in 
harmony with the government and most deputies in the parliament. 
After all, the parliament adopted a special resolution last year 
stating that the Slovenia's objective is full membership in the 
North Atlantic Alliance. There are forces here, however, that 
oppose it. They do not have a majority, nevertheless they play 
an important role on the political scale: They are, above all, 
some of the liberal democrats, currently the strongest Slovene 
party, and the entire party of the former communists. Even 
these people understand, however, that a direct opposition runs 
contrary to public inclinations, and therefore they have been 
using all kinds of intrigues and frauds to block actual 
cooperation with the Alliance. Because of one such intrigue, for 
instance, the cooperation with the U.S. National Guard, which is 
of a great importance to our army, has been jeopardized. These 
are the same people who, as early as spring 1991, tried to 
prevent the formation of the Slovene Army and render Slovene 
independence impossible. Today, they disagree with spending on 
the establishment of a defense system that would be comparable 
with the European one. Therefore, none of our units has a 
communication system compatible with the Western standards. At 
the same time, the "Partnership" assumes precisely compatible 
equipment so that one of the principal intentions could be 
realized -- joint military exercises. 
<H5>  Business as Usual </H5>
  [Marjanovic] What exactly is the objective of the Slovene 
communists? 
  [Jansa] The problem is that Slovenia has not passed through 
such a change as the Czech Republic, for instance. The top 
echelons of the past regime remained virtually unchanged in 
Slovenia and continue to operate from the same positions they 
held then. Hence, they are people who have, for 40 or 50 years, 
been spreading fear about a West that thirsts for our blood, and 
today, it is, for them, just a simple extension of business as 
usual. For them, the North Atlantic alliance has always been a 
tool of imperialism. Their goal is to keep Slovenia outside the 
European and world integration, because they have not yet 
abandoned the idea of joining Slovenia -- or at least 
cooperating -- with those countries in which socialism has 
survived, be it in the territory of the former Yugoslavia or on 
a wider scale. 
  [Marjanovic] Does it mean that a substantial number of 
Slovene politicians endorse the idea of the revival of 
Yugoslavia? 
  [Jansa] Yes. It is not based on political ideas, however, 
but rather on purely economic interests and, last but not least, 
also on family relations. 
  [Marjanovic] What about President Kucan? 
  [Jansa] To a great degree, the president symbolizes this 
situation: Until recently, he was -- the last -- chairman of 
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Slovenia. It is 
characteristic of the situation that, at one of its last plenums 
(before the party changed its name), their Central Committee 
condemned the "politics of U.S. imperialism." Although they 
speak differently today, the thinking of those people has simply 
not changed. 

<H5>    We Do Not Control Our Own Airspace </H5>
  [Marjanovic] Can Slovenia today shop the world markets for 
arms? 
  [Jansa] So far, we have not assigned any money for such 
purchases. Whether anyone would sell us something depends on 
how he views our country, either as an independent country or as 
a republic of the former Yugoslavia. From the legal point of 
view, the countries that recognized us should no longer apply 
the embargo to us. Nevertheless, it is not just the sale of 
arms. The world as a whole still refers to the term of "former 
Yugoslavia," be it in matters regarding the UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] or other world undertakings. As soon as that term 
disappears, the resolution on the embargo will no longer be 
valid. 
  [Marjanovic] So, until then, foreign aircraft can fly over 
Slovenia at an altitude of 6,000 meters and the Slovene anti- 
aircraft defenses will not act --because of a lack of technical 
equipment? 
  [Jansa] It would register them in some regions, but would 
not be able to take any action against them. In other places, 
they would not even be registered. We do not even control our 
air space as a whole today, how could we think of defending it? 
  [Marjanovic] Upon the recent announcement of the NATO 
ultimatum regarding the withdrawal of heavy equipment from the 
proximity of Sarajevo, you said that the alliance did not adopt 
any security provisions for the surrounding countries. Do you 
believe that the danger still exists of dragging Slovenia into 
the Balkan war? 
  [Jansa] At the moment, such a danger is not likely. It 
would be different if the conflict again approached our border. 
Regarding the ultimatum, one cannot but note that it did not 
think of the possible consequences. If threatened, the Serbian 
forces could act completely irrationally and endanger the 
neighboring countries. 
  [Marjanovic] You do not consider the Slovene-Croatian border 
dispute dangerous? 
  [Jansa] This does not concern such great problems that it 
could become the reason for a military conflict. 
<H5>  Muslims Are No Longer Naive </H5>
  [Marjanovic] What would be the consequences of imposing 
economic sanctions against Croatia? Do you believe that such a 
step would be reflected in an even closer cooperation between 
the Croatian and Serbian forces in Bosnia? 
  [Jansa] Yes, in the event of anti-Croat sanctions, one could 
also contemplate the Serbs and the Croats coming closer 
together. The pressure on Muslims would be only enhanced. The 
key issue of Serbo-Croatian relationship would nevertheless 
remain unsolved -- the conquered territory in Croatia. 
  [Marjanovic] How long, do you believe, can the war continue? 
  [Jansa] Neither of the so-called warring sides has such 
supremacy that it could achieve an absolute military victory. 
Not even the greater cooperation you mentioned, between the 
Serbs and the Croats, could definitely defeat the Muslims in a 
short time span. After all, they have also consolidated 
themselves, and -- especially -- they are no longer naive. It 
was precisely their naivete that resulted in such a large number 
of Muslim casualties. They no longer say that they do not know 
where the grenades are coming from. 
  If the world continues to let the war lie fallow, it can all 
go on for a very long time. The peace potentials necessary for 
the war to end by itself simply do not exist here. If it all 
goes on, then, the danger of its spreading to our territory 
remains. Measures to prevent this were taken in Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. The deployment 
of symbolic U.S. units there means a lot for the situation. In 
the case of Kosovo, however, the world assumed that the region 
is an administrative part of Serbia. 
  [Marjanovic] Hence, it will not object to conceivable ethnic 
purges? 
  [Jansa] They have taken place there for the past 15 years, 
and the world had no objections.

<F P=106> [Article by Sylwester Walczak from New York: "Former U.S. </F>
Ambassador in Warsaw to Clinton: Support Kuklinski"] 
  [Text] Richard T. Davies, former ambassador of the United 
States to Poland, recently sent an open letter to U.S. President 
Bill Clinton. In the letter, Davies requests intervention in the 
case of Colonel Ryszard Kuklinski. 
  Davies suggests that Clinton bring up the issue of 
Kuklinski's rehabilitation during his visit to Poland, scheduled 
for July. "I hope that you might draw President Walesa's 
attention to the irony of the fact that the Pole, who before 
1989 risked his life to help NATO, officially remains a traitor 
and is liable to imprisonment, whereas the leaders of today's 
Poland boast of its participation in NATO training and insist 
upon full membership in this organization," writes Davies. He 
emphasizes the "striking anomaly" that, in the case of the 
people who were sentenced earlier for treason, such as 
Spasowski, Rurarz, and Najder, the sentences were waived, but 
the charges against Kuklinski still stand. 
  Davies recalls his earlier pleas defending the colonel, when 
he made an appeal published in THE WASHINGTON POST, and in 
letters to senators and congressmen, in which he suggested that 
Kuklinski's rehabilitation be the preliminary condition for 
Poland's admission to NATO. Kuklinski himself objected to such 
a proposal at that time; he claimed that he attaches greater 
importance to Poland's security, and, therefore, he would not 
like this issue to even slightly impede Polish efforts to become 
a member of the organization. 
  "Now the situation has changed," notes Davies. Poland has 
joined the "Partnership for Peace," which is supposed to lead it 
to NATO. For this reason, the president of the United States, 
Poland's partner in this program, has a chance to repair the 
evil by "persistently insisting" that the same criteria applied 
in the cases of Spasowski, Rurarz, and Najder be applied to 
Kuklinski. 
  However, the Office of the President of the Polish Republic 
states that each of the three ways to rehabilitate Colonel 
Kuklinski--extraordinary appeal, another trial, or an act of 
clemency by the president--requires that he take the first step; 
this is because--Davies quotes a letter from the Belweder--the 
public debate that took place in Poland in 1992 did not provide 
any final answer to the question of whether Kuklinski deserves 
to be called a contemporary Wallenrod [heroic character in 
Polish literature], or simply a foreign spy. 
  Davies foresees two obstacles that Clinton may encounter in 
making an intervention in the case of Kuklinski. The president 
may decide that this problem is too minor to affect the good 
atmosphere of U.S.-Polish relations in any way; or he may decide 
that it is an internal Polish affair. 
  However, due to what Kuklinski did for the West, NATO, the 
United States, and the freedom of his own country, he really 
deserves strong support of the United States, argues Davies. 
Apart from that, he is now a U.S. citizen and the U.S. 
authorities should be concerned about his good name.

  [Text] The residents of Vitez, Travnik, Novi Travnik, and 
other towns in central Bosnia watched a kind of air show today. 
At 1612, two Super-Galeb aircraft of the former Yugoslav 
People's Army appeared in the sky above central Bosnia. 
Choosing their targets, they obviously wanted to demonstrate 
the planes' capabilities and the pilots' skills. Judging by 
appearances, the aircraft were only a bait for NATO planes 
because they did not engage in combat activity. So as not to be 
hit by ground weapons, one aircraft released protective flares 
over Vitez. The exhibition by Serb pilots ended at 1635, when 
NATO planes appeared flying at a very high altitude. The Serb 
Galebs gained height and flew away toward their home base, 
accompanied by whistles of many people who watched the display 
and obviously did not understand the aim of such a show of force.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 6 (TANJUG) -- The Bosnian Serb 
Republic (R.S.) and the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) on 
Sunday agreed on the opening of two air corridors to Tuzla, a 
Muslim-held town in the north-eastern part of the former 
Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The agreement was reached at Pale, the R.S. administrative 
centre, between R.S. president Radovan Karadzic, special U.N. 
Secretary-General's envoy for the former Yugoslavia Yasushi 
Akashi, and UNPROFOR Commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gen. 
Michael Rose, the R.S. news agency SRNA said. 
  Akashi confirmed after the meeting that an agreement had 
been 
reached on the opening of two air corridors which would link 
Tuzla with Croatia's capital of Zagreb and the Croatian Adriatic 
port of Split. Akashi said that the ways and means of securing 
the airfield near Tuzla had also been agreed. 
  The Japanese diplomat said that Karadzic had guaranteed the 
safe use of the airfield, but there remained some difficulties 
with the other two sides, the Bosnian Muslims and Croats, with 
whom he said no agreement had been reached yet. 
  A group of Russian experts left for Tuzla on Sunday to carry 
out preparations for the opening of the airfield in line with an 
agreement reached between the Russian Government and the R.S. 
  Russian observers will check all deliveries which arrive at 
the Dubrava airfield near Tuzla, because the Serb side fears the 
airfield could be used for illegal munitions shipments to the 
Bosnian Muslims. 
  Karadzic said after the meeting with the two UNPROFOR 
officials that he was satisfied since "things are moving in a 
positive direction and confidence is also gradually increasing." 
  The R.S. president set out special interest in the "free 
movement of civilians in Sarajevo, since arounds 60,000 Serbs 
are still to be found in the Muslim section of the city, where 
they are held as ethnic hostages." Karadzic recalled that an 
agreement had been reached at the Geneva peace talks on the free 
movement of civilians between the Serb and Muslim sections of 
Sarajevo. 
  Asked to comment the statements of Bosnian Muslim leaders 
that peace could be reached in Bosnia-Herzegovina in April if 
the Serbs were to join the Croat-Muslim agreement on a 
federation, Karadzic said that "peace is possible even earlier." 
He, however, said he doubted the new coalition's readiness to 
accept a peaceful solution to the conflict. 
  Karadzic recalled that Muslims and Croats had been "hostile 
towards Serbs" in both the first and second world wars, just as 
he said they were now.

others, President Gligorov emphasized that on 26 February 1944 
the 3d Macedonian Elite Group was formed in the Kumanovo village 
of Zegljane, consisting of over 320 fighters whose number 
subsequently kept growing. 
  "The National Liberation War of the Macedonian people and 
the 
nationalities living in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia -- FYROM] during World War II, like all previous 
rebellions and insurrections, was for national liberation and 
was defensive. Macedonia, occupied by various conquerors and 
aspirants to foreign territories over the centuries, sacrificed 
and shared, but never surrendered. Not only in the battles, in 
which around 24,000 soldiers lost their lives just between 1941 
and 1945, but it also won its sovereignty and independence in a 
peaceful, dignified, and democratic way, and there are few such 
countries in the world. The Republic of Macedonia has avoided 
the war that has been raging in our immediate neighborhood for 
two years. It has avoided divisions, and ethnic, inter-ethnic, 
and religious conflicts. It has avoided intervention from 
abroad and the possible expansion of the war onto our 
territories. It is of great importance not only for our state, 
but also for Europe and the international community. 
  The Republic of Macedonia has become a member of the United 
Nations, as well as of other international forums and 
associations. The Republic of Macedonia has been officially 
recognized by many countries, and by members of the European 
Union, which have opened diplomatic offices in our country. 
Because of all this, we are deeply interested in building 
relations and cooperation with all our neighbors on the basis of 
good neighborliness and in the interest of peace and certainly 
stability in the region. This constant determination that we 
have cannot be endangered by any blockades, or political or 
economic pressures, such as the latest measures by the Greek 
Government in closing the borders and the port of Salonika to 
our goods. As we always have in the past, we are resolutely 
opposing all pressures and we shall not allow anybody to deny 
our centuries-long Macedonian name. Macedonia is surviving and 
it will continue to survive," President Kiro Gligorov told a 
rally in Kumanovo celebrating the 50th anniversary of the 
formation of the 3d Macedonian Elite Group.

<F P=106> [Goran Gotev commentary: "NATO Crossed War's `Sound </F>
Barrier'"] 
  [Text] The report begins with bombs and sounds like a 
bomb. For the first time since NATO was formed in 1949, its Air 
Force took part in a combat operation in Europe, outside the 
range of the North Atlantic Alliance. Another "first" -- for 
the first time since the beginning of the ethnic and religious 
conflict in Bosnia, foreign forces interfered in the conflict. 
Such were the initial assessments of the political observers 
after it was reported that U.S. F-16 aircraft belonging to 
NATO's allied Air Force, took off from the base in Aviano and 
shot down four "Galeb" aircraft in the Banja Luka region, which 
is controlled by the Serbs. 
  The report marked a new date in the history of the longest 
and bloodiest military crisis in Europe since the end of World 
War II. Until now, even the famous NATO ultimatum of 9 February 
did not cause an escalation, however, the air action of the U.S. 
fighters in Bosnia crossed the border at which things become 
unpredictable and dangerous. 
  One was not surprised by the explanation given by NATO 
headquarters. The UN Security Council resolution that envisages 
a "clear sky" over Bosnia, i.e. a ban on military flights that 
have not been authorized by the United Nations Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR], has been violated. The truth is yet to be 
established, but a fact is well-known. The three fighting sides 
have violated the ban on flights since the day the resolution 
was adopted. Periodically one of the sides accuses the others 
of utilizing helicopters or combat aircraft. Nevertheless, 
NATO's "AWACS" intelligence aircraft have not accused any of the 
sides of violating the resolution, nor has UNPROFOR publicly 
warned any of the fighting sides. 
  Without justifying the actions of those who violated the 
resolution, and regardless of whether the airplanes were Serbian 
or not, it is obvious that NATO's operation comes at a very 
inappropriate moment -- precisely when the world public sighed 
with relief that the ultimatum did not prompt a bombardment and 
even directed the developments toward peace. The air operation 
contradicted the conclusion of the "Blue Helmets" commanders, 
who said that the cease-fire was generally observed, and the 
opinion of the political figures that the Sarajevo model of 
peacemaking must gradually be expanded to include all of Bosnia. 
  The first military intervention of NATO in Europe must evoke 
great concern. It demonstrated that contrary to Butrus-Ghali's 
assurance, the commanding center of the military operations in 
Bosnia is not in the UN glass skyscraper in New York, but in the 
Pentagon, and that Washington deliberately seeks an escalation 
in the conflict to prompt a new division of Bosnia's territory. 
It is not very hard to establish that the attack against the 
four airplanes in the Banja Luka sky, which was peaceful since 
the beginning of the war, was directly related to the tripartite 
talks in Washington on establishing the Croatian-Muslim 
federation. The U.S. plan practically eliminates the EC plan on 
dividing Bosnia into three parts. On the other hand, it 
envisages a much greater territory for the future federation 
than the Bosnia Serbs would be willing to concede. 
  Consequently, NATO's air fist had the important goal of 
demonstrating power to force the Serbs to make territorial 
concessions under the threat of military intervention. An 
unidentified Russian diplomat demanded an explanation from NATO 
regarding the air operation and said: "What happened is what we 
feared most and warned against frequently." 
  If one adds to this alarming sensation the intention of 
UNPROFOR to allow the "Blue Helmets" who accompany the 
humanitarian relief convoys, to open fire in order to clear the 
way, even without informing the fighting sides about this, it 
becomes clear that Bosnia is heading toward a new military 
escalation. They say that this corresponds to the interests of 
the Muslims and their protectors, the Americans. This could be 
so. However, it does not correspond to the desire of Bosnia's 
population for peace and the efforts of the world community to 
stop this shameful butchery.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Excerpts] The leader of the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF] parliamentary group [Ferenc Kulin] does not consider it 
probable that the government will start any sort of inquiry into 
the dismissals of radio staff for it has no right to do so. 
Levente Sukosd reports from Ferenc Kulin's press briefing. 
  [Begin recording] [Kulin] We consider and have to consider 
this endeavor on the part of the vice president as being totally 
obvious, since we in the Cultural Committee in 1991 were the 
ones who very resolutely requested and demanded from the then 
presidents of radio and television the implementation of a 
radical cut in staff. 
  [Sukosd] The list of names published today was a surprise 
for 
Kulin, he did not know the content of it until today, he said. 
He considers that this was not a politically motivated 
decision. [passage omitted] Kulin said that he believes [radio 
vice president] Laszlo Csucs could if necessary also convince 
public opinion that he has only dismissed editors who violated 
the radio's ethical code. Parliament is unable to deal with the 
matter properly until the media bill is adopted, however the 
parties' consensus would be needed for this. [passage omitted] 
  The government and the government party are not responsible 
for the situation, said Kulin. The dismissal of the vice 
president, according to the law on appointments adopted in 1990, 
can only be initiated by the employer, that is the prime 
minister. According to Ferenc Kulin's information, Prime 
Minister Peter Boross does not intend to take this measure. 
[passage omitted] 
  Because of the dismissals at the radio, the Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ] has appealed to Prime Minister Peter Boross to 
initiate the release of Laszlo Csucs and Gabor Nahlik, vice 
presidents of radio and television respectively. Ivan Peto, 
party chairman, gave an interview in Nyiregyhaza to Miklos Nagy. 
  [Begin recording] [Peto] The manner of the dismissals, that 
is that they are released from work with immediate effect and 
that they are not allowed to work during the period of notice, 
makes it perfectly unequivocal that these are not austerity 
measures. The government wants to silence the still existing 
multi-colored voice of radio. The fact is that the Government 
wants to make a propaganda institution out of the radio, as has 
already been done to television. [passage omitted] [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] According to the deputy chairman of the 
Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the radio dismissals 
threaten the functioning of the institution. Edit Schranz 
reports. 
  [Schranz] Fidesz Deputy Chairman Tamas Deutsch does not 
believe that one can sincerely talk of rationalization in 
connection with the dismissals at Hungarian radio. At a news 
briefing, Deutsch said the following: Laszlo Csucs has been in 
office, vested with full presidental power, for a year. If he 
believes that radio staff have to be made redundant for economic 
reasons, just when the government submits the new version of the 
Media Bill, which is to regulate the operation of radio, then 
something is not right; either that the vice president is 
competent in what he is doing, or that there is no political 
cleansing behind the dismissals. You can hear Tamas Deutsch: 
  [Begin Deutsch recording] The political intent behind the 
decisions is unacceptable for me. I am very sad because 
Hungarian radio's capability of functioning may be endangered, 
and just in a special period, in the midst of the election 
campaign. This measure has a particularly unfavorable and 
negative effect on the election campaign. But it also has a 
direct effect: Since it is a step which becomes a political 
scandal and a political stumbling block, it will obviously 
divert the election campaign, possibly for weeks, from the path 
-- which is normal to my mind -- of parties talking about their 
programs. The whole affair which is taking place at television 
and radio -- now especially at radio -- does influence the 
elections. However, politicians of the governing parties: do not 
entertain hopes! The past four years will not be forgotten. 
This in itself will not significantly increase the chances of 
the government parties. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] The Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP] considers 
the 
dismissal of leading radio staff, en masse and for an outright 
political reason, to be an open attack against democracy and 
press freedom. Kata Peli Nagy reports on the HSP's stance. 
  [Nagy] The leadership of the HSP is calling on Laszlo Csucs 
to revoke his decision. Party Chairman Gyula Horn today rang 
the radio vice chairman to get information on the backdrop to 
the dismissals. In Horn's view, the individuals in question have 
always served independent broadcasting. According to the HSP, 
the vice president's measure unfavorably influences the 
elections. They are afraid that radio, similarly with 
television, will become a mouthpiece of the Government. In the 
HSP's opinion, the Government is also responsible for the 
situation which has emerged, since everything happened with the 
support of the Cabinet. Yesterday they even provided money for 
the dismissals. 
  What will the HSP do in this situation? Gyula Horn said the 
following: 
  [Begin Horn recording] If this decision is not revoked, and 
the HSP enters Government as a result of the elections, the HSP 
will immediately take steps to reinstate these generally 
esteemed experts in their position. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] The Presidium of the National Association of 
Hungarian Journalists [MUOSZ] has received the news about the 
radio dismissals with indignation. MUOSZ agrees with there 
being a review of the radio's financial situation and with the 
absolutely necessary redundancies. However, the MUOSZ cannot 
accept the radio leadership sacking people for an outright 
political reason; by doing so it makes the provision of 
multifaceted and objective information impossible. These 
dismissals, which are unprecedented in the profession and which 
are happening just before the elections, threaten democracy to 
an extent which cannot be indifferent to anybody, the MUOSZ 
statement says.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Canton"] </F>
  [Text] Some people thought that they would not dare do it, 
because it is equivalent to trampling upon the freedom of the 
press. Some people thought that they do not want to do it. They 
have done it. This is the biggest clear-up in the Radio since 
1956. The MTI statement "Dismissals at the Hungarian Radio" in 
which this was officially published, is a historical document of 
this age. The statement formulated by Deputy Chairman Laszlo 
Csucs is a rare example of cynicism and hypocrisy. He, who has 
been working on, caressing, and polishing up the list of names 
for weeks, knows very well how much truth is in this statement: 
"The dismissals -- contrary to the published accusations -- 
were made on the basis of professional and ethical points of 
view, rather than political ones." It is enough to examine the 
list of names to understand what Csucs -- who with one stroke 
"streamlined" and beheaded the "168 ora" program -- means by 
professional and ethical viewpoints. Csucs's right to refer to 
ethics is well shown by the fact that he justified the 
"streamlining" by referring to the National Audit Office's [ASZ] 
investigations. The only unpleasant factor is that the chairman 
of the ASZ protests strongly against this. 
  A few weeks ago, Istvan Csurka's Hungarian Justice and Life 
Party [MIEP] was ready to support Laszlo Csucs as a 
parliamentary candidate. This was the only party he could 
definitely rely on. Now it is much easier to understand the 
reason: Csucs has indeed implemented Csurka's program in 
Hungarian Radio. Presumably, others also encouraged him to do 
this. Some people in the Hungarian Democratic Forum would like 
nothing better than to build bridges toward the Hungarian Way 
Circles, to "prove themselves," and to gain votes from Csurka's 
supporters. It will be an expensive bridge but, cost what it 
may, there are not any free votes left anywhere else. 
  The question, of course, is what the cabinet and the biggest 
governing party say about the "slaughtering on Friday" [4 
March]. So far -- unofficially -- we could hear that the prime 
minister is unfortunately in a trap, because, although he could 
relieve Csucs, what would come after that? The parties are 
unable to agree on a successor.... And: Due to the 
circumstances, the government is not responsible for Csucs's 
actions. Naturally, it is conceivable that [Prime Minister] 
Boross was serious about this. However, this will not improve 
his position: Those people, who will demonstrate on the eve of 
15 March [Hungarian National Day] -- which is also the day of 
the freedom of the press -- people, who are justifiably 
concerned about the cleanness of the elections, will not be 
writing to Csucs. No one wants to correspond with Csucs, who 
wanted to have the police remove his colleagues from the Radio 
building in Sandor Brody street. It is a waste of stamps. The 
addressee of the protest letters will be Peter Boross. There 
will not be many people either in Hungary or abroad who will 
believe that he and his colleagues -- the government members -- 
could not have done anything. Only to mention one factor, if 
more than 100 million forints from the tight budget had not been 
voted for partly financing severance pay then the dismissed 
people could not have been sent away. Naturally, after all 
this, we will not have a media law, and we fear that the 
consensus on certain issues on which there was a hope for 
reaching it, will also be endangered. If it has been difficult 
to escape from the trap up to now, it is twice as difficult now: 
It is a double trap. 
  Finally, Csucs's statement also contains the weighty 
argument 
that the "radio in Canton prepares seven programs with 600 
employees for 60 million people." It will be interesting to 
observe if the government that so steadfastly advocates joining 
Europe will be able or willing to do anything to prevent the 
complete cantonization of the public service media.

<F P=106> ["L.K."-signed interview with Fabian Jozsa, political state </F>
secretary at the Interior Ministry; place and date not given: 
"Former Agents Need Not Expect To Face Legal Consequences 
Regarding Employment"] 
  [Text] Prior examination of a person's political past 
cannot be a condition for his employment because this would be 
anticonstitutional. Therefore, if it later comes to light that 
a civil servant had, for example, cooperated with the agents of 
Department III/III [former secret service], the sanction can 
only be public humiliation, said Fabian Jozsa, whom we 
interviewed on the implementation of the bill on examining the 
political past of people in certain important positions. 
  [Jozsa] The government does not intend to issue an order on 
executing the law on agents because the law precisely regulates 
the steps of examination. However, regarding certain technical 
details of the procedure, instructions will have to be issued, 
but these will only help the work of the committees. The 
premises, the necessary equipment, and the fees for the 
participants will have to be ensured. Naturally the government 
will bear the costs. It is worth mentioning that the law on the 
legal standing of civil servants has to be applied in the case 
of the committee members who will carry out the examinations -- 
who will be judges elected by parliament for a limited period -- 
because the service conditions of the judges will be suspended 
during this time. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Do I understand correctly that many 
committees will operate? 
  [Jozsa] Yes, as a result of a deputy's proposal, the bill 
makes it possible for the necessary number of committees to 
operate to fulfill the tasks. Parliament will have to decide 
this issue. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The original proposal contained the names of 
people to be examined in order of importance, thus determining 
the order of the examinations at the same time. Therefore, the 
parliamentary deputies will be first, followed by the president 
of the republic and the government members, while certain heads 
of state-owned banks and insurance companies will be examined 
last of all, this being the last point on the list. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] When will the bill come into force? 
  [Jozsa] According to the plans, only the rules on forming 
the committees and their activities will come into force when 
the law is announced; the other rules will come into force on 1 
July. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Does this mean that we cannot expect any 
examinations before the elections? 
  [Jozsa] It would be technically impossible to begin the 
examinations earlier. However, this will not be a problem 
because the examinations will have to be started right after the 
new Parliament is formed. The law does not actually extend to 
the parliamentary candidates, therefore, this cannot influence 
the decision of the voters. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] In what period of time does the examination 
of these people have to be completed? 
  [Jozsa] The law stipulates one year; all these people have 
to be examined during this period. The same will happen if 
someone takes up his position later; his examination will have 
to be completed within one year of his taking up his position. 
The law will remain in force until July 2000; therefore, the 
Parliament formed after the 1998 elections will also be examined. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The bill does not envisage the application 
of sanctions, but can people who are found to have cooperated 
with the III/III service expect to face legal consequences as 
far as their employment is concerned? 
  [Jozsa] No, but this would be out of the question in the 
case of people in elected positions. The law stipulates public 
humiliation as the only sanction. I believe that this will make 
everyone think, and former agents will voluntarily leave after 
-- or even before -- the examination. It is worth mentioning 
here that, in addition to former III/III members, the law also 
applies to all those people who regularly received agents' 
reports because of their position, namely the former secretaries 
of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee, the 
former members of the Political Committee, and former prime 
ministers, interior ministers, and defense ministers. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Are you planning to examine the candidates 
before filling positions that fall under the government's sphere 
of authority? 
  [Jozsa] The law does not give authority for this. Prior 
examination cannot be a condition for employment because this 
would be against the Constitution. Therefore, if someone is 
later found to have, for example, cooperated with Department 
III/III, public humiliation can be the only sanction in this 
area, too. At the same time, naturally, the person who makes 
the appointments will try to find people with immaculate past 
records in other ways; for example, a statement by the candidate 
could be a solution. However, a false statement cannot have 
legal consequences as far as employment is concerned.

<F P=106> [Interview with Janos Deak, newly appointed commander of the </F>
Hungarian Army, by Andras Peto; place and date not given: "Our 
Eyes Were Opened Too Late"] 
  [Text] [Peto] It seems that since the beginning of last 
week the world has again become bipolar: International 
conflicts cannot be settled without Russia. Will all this 
affect Hungary's military role in the Yugoslav crisis? 
  [Deak] Russia has always been and will continue to be a 
great military power. We soldiers can only rejoice that the air 
attack in Bosnia failed to materialize and that the two 
previously opposing great military powers are now engaged in 
dialogue. This has also been noticeable from a military 
viewpoint lately and it has perhaps contributed to easing the 
Yugoslav tension. Our crisis prevention and crisis management 
concepts were approved by our prime minister and president at 
the end of 1991, and at the end of 1993, starting with the 
defense law and the constitutional modifications, the president 
again approved the concepts presented by Prime Minister Boross. 
The essence of our concept is that the Hungarian Republic 
should stay away from the Yugoslav conflict. Such a position 
was reaffirmed after Yugoslav bombs were dropped at Barcs in 
November 1991. Since then, we have maintained a steady, 
correct, but distanced contact with both the Yugoslav and 
Croatian military leadership; we do not yet have Bosnian 
contacts. The most tense period was perhaps the second half of 
1991 and the first half of 1992, when we had to apply a larger 
number of troops and expenses to strengthen our air defense and 
to deploy radar units. There is no direct threat on our borders 
now. Until the the NATO deadline expired, we strengthened our 
preparedness. Our air force units are on constant alert, and we 
can even increase this alert in tenser periods by increasing the 
level of combat readiness of one or two aircraft. Regarding our 
ground forces we will strengthen the surveillance units and 
services at some bases if necessary, and we will increase the 
efficiency of leadership; this means that, if necessary, we will 
keep the individual operational groups within individual 
headquarters. Obviously, it is important to have cooperation 
and contacts with the countries in question, including 
Yugoslavia. 
  [Peto] Would the Hungarian military approach to the Yugoslav 
crisis have been different if NATO had shown greater readiness 
to accept the Hungarian request to join the organization? 
  [Deak] This is a political question, not a military one. 
From a military viewpoint, we can only advise our state leaders 
to proceed from the interests of our small country. 
  [Peto] In one of your recent statements you said that the 
Hungarian officers are not leftist in their political 
orientation. How can one draw this conclusion in the Hungarian 
Army, which is so sensitive about its apolitical character? 
  [Deak] In accordance with the new defense law, the officer 
corps of the Hungarian Army cannot carry out party policy 
activity, and officers cannot be members of a political party. 
This was the desire of most of our officers. The Hungarian 
officers are neither leftist nor rightist in orientation; they 
are Hungarian military officers. Regarding the composition of 
our officer corps, it is quite different from the eight or 10 
years ago. At the moment, there are 13,500 officers serving in 
the Hungarian Army; some 5,500 have retired, moved into the 
reserves, or taken up a different job since the change of 
regime. There has been a complete change of personnel in army 
headquarters, and the heads of main army groups and heads of 
army groups today are people who did not serve in these 
positions before 1989. Among the middle-level commanding 
officers, no one served as army corps commander or brigadier 
general before. And some of the old political officers left the 
army and some of them are working in various professional 
positions. The lieutenants and first lieutenants who are coming 
into the service now began their military studies in 1989. I do 
not even want to know who means what by leftist or rightist; it 
is pointless to deal with this issue in the army. I do not 
believe that our officers think about their political 
affiliations. It is another matter that the officers are rather 
sensitive socially. This is understandable when you consider 
that a lieutenant's pay is about 17,000-18,000 forints. 
  [Peto] However, many people think that the Hungarian army 
officers have been given a strong ideological training. 
  [Deak] One can make someone hate ideology through training. 
Otto Habsburg said that he has travelled a lot throughout the 
world and when he met an anti-Soviet man in Africa, the man 
probably graduated from Lumumba University in Moscow; if someone 
does not like the Americans, he probably studied in America. 
Besides, the number of hours dedicated to the study of 
Marxism-Leninism at the military academies fell well short of 
the number of similar hours in the civilian universities. In my 
opinion, most officers have always served in the army because 
they liked being soldiers, and party membership was almost an 
automatic prerequisite for this job. That time is past. We 
did not know the situation and we did not have information. If 
I want to describe things simply and shortly, I must say that 
our eyes were opened too late. We lived in isolation, in army 
barracks and in housing developments, and we read the official 
newspapers; people who had a different television aerial and 
could watch a different program came under special surveillance. 
After all, everyone made sure they kept the rules of the game if 
they wanted to stay in the army. 
  [Peto] In 1989 the army was separated from the Defense 
Ministry in order to formalize its apolitical character. With 
the new defense law, this situation has been practically 
reversed: the defense minister has the right to give orders to 
the army commander. And the minister has just become a party 
chairman and the Defense Ministry public administration state 
secretary is also the military expert of the same party; and the 
same party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], provides the 
political secretary too. One cannot exclude the possibility 
that, after the elections, the Defense Ministry will come under 
similarly strong control of another party. Do you think that, 
by this, the army has become an instrument of party interests 
and its character as a national institution has ceased? 
  [Deak] We are completely independent of the parties, and 
we want to stay independent. I must say that the separation of 
the Defense Ministry and Army Headquarters in 1989 was done in a 
very brutal way. A lot of administrative and ministerial tasks 
remained with army headquarters. On the basis of the new 
defense law, the army is controlled from various sides: the 
president of the republic, Parliament, the government, and the 
minister. Without going into detail, I must conclude that the 
authority of both president and Parliament has become stronger. 
As he himself used to say, on entering the ministry building, 
the minister ceases to be a party man, and the army commander 
continues to have his former authority. The army is led by its 
commander. The ruling defense minister can only give orders to 
the army commander, and he can only ask for a report from the 
army commander. Any order has legal consequences, and this 
means that an order can only be issued on something that has 
legal conditions. The essential thing is that the defense 
minister manages his ministry on the basis of the law and 
regulations; he must accept responsibility for the budget and 
supplying the army, and he must supervise distribution and 
consumption; the ministry is also the army's legal 
representative, but the minister is not a commander. This is 
the difference compared with the old ways. The administrative 
state secretary cannot have any control whatever over the army 
and its headquarters. 
  [Peto] In any case, regarding the legal status of the state 
secretaries, the law says that the professional activity of the 
ministry is directed by the administrative state secretary, 
although some of the military leadership's tasks have been 
placed under the ministry's control. 
  [Deak] The Defense Ministry will most probably be a special 
ministry. The bloc within the ministry that will make up the 
country's actual military leadership will have to fulfill at 
least three tasks, namely to coordinate the military 
professional parts of the ministry, carry out the classic 
strategic and tactical planning activities of headquarters, and 
operate as a military command. The aforementioned tasks of the 
state secretary cannot apply to the military bloc in the 
ministry. 
  [Peto] At your parliamentary hearing, you said that it was 
not a good idea to include elements of an economic organization 
in the defense budget. What do you think would be the right 
thing, and what can be done with the funds available? 
  [Deak] We are in a very difficult situation. For us to be 
free of economic difficulties, our budget would neet to be a few 
billion forints bigger. The budget envisages a compulsory 
income of 8 billion forints for us, but presumably we will not 
be able to fulfill this because no one wants to buy our deserted 
barracks and we have no weapons to sell. 
  [Peto] Thinking of the Lupis [investment] scandal, the 
circulation of money does not seem to be a definitely military 
virtue. 
  [Deak] The army should definitely keep away from such 
activity. Even if it happens at other ministries, the Hungarian 
Army should not be obliged to generate income. The budget 
should cover our expenses! Maintaining the technical level of 
our equipment is at least as important as providing housing, 
clothing, food, and training for our soldiers. Without the 
latter, lives could be endangered. We have often declared our 
priorities: air defense, leadership, reconnaissance, and 
electronic warfare. In addition, we have tasks originating from 
the recent partnership for peace program and peacekeeping 
activities. According to the new budget, we can spend 160-170 
forints a day on food, but the soldiers have to be housed and 
given books to read, television to watch and tape recorders, as 
well as training. One cannot stress enough the importance of 
training, and all this costs a lot of money. For example, this 
year we cannot take our aircraft to the Baltic Sea to shoot live 
ammunition because we do not have the necessary 200 million 
forints. For example, a small portable air-defense missile 
costs 800,000 forints. Of course, it would be cheaper to train 
on simulators in the long run, but these simulators also have to 
be purchased, and they are very expensive too. A tank simulator 
costs 30 million forints, and an anti-armor missile costs more 
than 100,000 forints. But let me not only complain: A pilot 
flies 80 hours a year, and this is more than in any country in 
our neighborhood; we are training the MIG-20 squadron and 
placing it in operation; we carry out subunit exercises with 
live ammunition too; and we are continuing to train of 
commanders. I find the battalion- level exercises very 
important, but all this costs a lot of money and we are using 
our reserves. As the State Auditing Office showed us, we must 
reexamine our budget and administrative systems. Besides, any 
activity that has no connection with military life is quite 
alien to me. In any case, I hope the recent financial affair 
was a big lesson, and the consequences must be born by the 
relevant people.

<F P=106> ["The Election Program of the Hungarian Socialist Party"] </F>
  [Text] Hungary is again facing elections. It will decide 
whether to give four more years of rule to those who turned 
incompetence into a government policy and who lectured the 
people instead of serving them. Hungary will decide whether to 
keep in power those who further deteriorated the economic 
situation and brought the economy to the verge of collapse, 
people whose failure is reflected in an unemployment rate of 
almost 1 million, the fall of the middle classes, massive 
poverty, the hopeless situation of Hungarian agriculture, and 
the spread of corruption. Hungary will decide whether to 
continue to give credit to those who kept breaking their 
promises. 
  Contrary to its promises, this government has not become a 
government of freedom, because it is constantly attacking the 
institutions of freedom, and especially the press. It has not 
become the nation's government because, instead of cooperation, 
it caused a fateful division. It has not become a European 
government, because its policy is antiquated and it propagates 
ideas that have been obsolete in the better part of our 
continent for half a century, and it opened the way to extreme 
right-wing efforts. It has not become the government of 
economic change either; instead, it has become a government of 
wasted opportunities. This government is responsible to the 
voters for all this. 
  According to the socialists, it is the government that 
failed, and not democracy and the market economy. We are facing 
difficult years, because the wasted confidence and time and the 
wasted goods and resources cannot be regained. The situation is 
not hopeless only because there is a choice. This country can 
be led out of the crisis and the conditions for national 
prosperity can be created with an honest and competent policy 
supported by society. The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] 
offers such a policy to the voters. 
  Our program aims at Hungary's economic and social 
modernization. We want a modern society based on an efficient 
economy, one connecting economic rationality with social 
solidarity, social care and modern education that reduce 
inequalities of chances, protection of human rights and 
universal human values, and the protection of nature and the 
environment. 
  We believe that there is no way back! Hungary cannot be led 
back into the deadend of either five or 50 years ago. We must 
again take the road that the nation set out on with full 
consensus in 1989- 1990, a road from which the nation was 
diverted by the coalition. We do not promise a new change in the 
regime; instead, we promise a foreseeable future that will again 
lay the foundations for the people's lost faith. We want a 
change, not chaos. 
  A Change in the Economy! [subhead] 
  We offer an economic policy that will halt the decline 
within 
two years and will lead us out of the crisis and create the 
conditions of a lasting growth of 1-3 percent annually. We 
offer firm legal frameworks, predictable economic conditions, 
and venture-oriented financial possibilities. Our program 
protects Hungary from an unforeseeable increase in our domestic 
and foreign debt and from rampant inflation. We will force the 
decline of the forint to between 15-20 percent within four years. 
  The essence of our economic policy is to reduce our 
economy's 
lack of capital, reduce its technological backwardness and, 
thus, increase its competitiveness. We will encourage projects, 
investments, and savings accordingly. We are determined to halt 
state waste and limit government expenditures. We will increase 
the pace of economic restructuring and will create the necessary 
legal and economic regulations as well as the institutions that 
are still missing. 
  We will attribute special attention to broadening the 
foreign 
markets of Hungarian products, especially rebuilding some of the 
lost East European markets. 
  Our economic policy program pays particular attention to the 
budget reform, the modernization of the Hungarian banking 
system, the development of infrastructure, the revival of 
agriculture, the structural reorganization and modernization of 
our processing industry, and to tourism. 
  We are striving to develop a political, legal, and economic 
environment in which an active capital of at least $1-1.5 
billion annually will flow into Hungary, a capital essential for 
laying the foundations of economic growth and servicing our 
foreign debt. Our goal is that foreign capital should primarily 
serve the spreading of modern technology as well as the 
modernization of our infrastructure, including transportation, 
telephone services, public services, and settlement development. 
<H5>  An Honest and Efficient Privatization </H5>
  We want an economy based on the decisive role of individual 
and partnership private property, one that guarantees the equal 
rights of various forms of property. We believe that the 
economy functions efficiently through the interest of natural 
owners. 
  We want to get rid of the current privatization practice. We 
will continue to privatize the state property, but for the 
benefit of increasing economic efficiency, preserving the 
domestic market of competitive Hungarian products, and securing 
technological development and employment. We will eliminate the 
State Property Managing Company Ltd and will restore 
parliamentary control over the State Property Agency. We will 
use the funds originating from the selling of state property to 
improve the viable companies, create new jobs, and cover the 
debts of state enterprises. 
  We support the participation of small investors and 
employees 
in the privatization process, but we oppose the free 
distribution of property. We will provide an active property to 
the local self- government bodies and forms of public 
foundations to educational, cultural, scientific, and sports 
institutions. We want to prevent large-scale dismissals and 
production reductions with guarantees stipulated in the 
privatization contracts. 
  We reject the distribution of property and positions to 
compensate for political services, but we respect property 
acquired through privatization, as any legally-acquired 
property. We will take a stand against abuses connected with 
privatization and corruption through publicity and with every 
legal means. 

<H5>    Agriculture: Market and Production Security! </H5>
  We want to put an end to the disintegration of the 
agricultural sector. Our program serves the foundation of a 
modern and competitive agriculture and of a secure future for 
peasants. We will conclude the process of compensations. We 
will reexamine the debts of agricultural farms and will 
temporarily halt the land tax. 
  Our agricultural policy is in favor of agricultural 
cooperatives; at the same time, it creates identical rights and 
conditions and provides identical defense to all agricultural 
producers and owners. In the course of privatization, our 
program provides an opportunity for domestic producers to become 
owners both in processing and marketing. Our program limits the 
emergence of monopolies. 
  Our program would eliminate the chaos prevailing on the 
producers' market and will offer improving incomes to producers. 
In a short time, we will halt the decrease in agricultural 
production and will lay the foundations for an annual growth of 
3-5 percent. 
  By gradually stabilizing the standard of living, we will 
halt 
the drop in domestic consumption, including the drop in food 
consumption. We will improve the competitiveness of our food 
production. For this, we will introduce a market defense used 
in the West, and we will initiate the broadening of the 
framework of the agreement signed with the European Union and an 
improvement in the marketing conditions of Hungarian products. 
<H5>  Unemployment: Human Tragedy and Economic Shackles </H5>
  We cannot promise the complete elimination of unemployment. 
Not even a spectacular economic growth is capable of 
eliminating the current unemployment rate of almost 1 million; 
on the contrary, unemployment itself becomes the main obstacle 
to economic growth. We can only change this situation by 
counting on our society's resources and solidarity. 
  We want to prolong the training and instruction period so 
that young people can seek employment later and with better 
chances. We will gradually assert the right to the first job. 
We want to free jobs by introducing part-time employment and a 
flexible retirement system. 
  We offer an economic policy that also considers employment 
factors in order to save jobs. We support the creation of jobs 
through a new investment policy, the development of 
infrastructure, and public utility work. In the course of this 
activity, we will pay particular attention to helping the 
backward areas to catch up. 
  We will reduce the number of unemployed people to about 
500,000 by 1998 by means of coordinated economic decisions. We 
will encourage the unemployed to find jobs by providing adequate 
unemployment benefits and active employment help, without 
forcing people. We will make their situation more bearable by 
means of a humane administration. 
<H5>  Legal Security and Democracy in the Employment Field! </H5>
  It is only possible to solve the economic and social crisis 
on the basis of a broad social agreement. In preserving social 
peace, we attribute a key role to the coordination of interests 
of the employers, employees and the government and to the active 
system of social partnership. We regard the trade unions as 
natural allies in the implementation of our program. 
  We want to strengthen legal security in the employment 
field. 
We will guarantee increased labor rights to women, people 
raising small children, and people with reduced working 
capacity. We will encourage collective agreements with 
political and legal means. 
<H3>  A Proper Human Environment! Help for Backward Areas To 
Catch Up! </H3>
  The value of environmental protection expenditures is 
extremely low in Hungary. The deterioraton of the natural and 
built environment is so big that it threatens the healthy human 
life and the quality of work. Our program will increase the 
environmental protection expenditure threefold in the next four 
years. We want to cover the expenses from public funds, but the 
correction of new environmental damages will be paid by the 
polluters themselves. We want to focus our resources on halting 
the pollution of our air and waters, saving the forests, and 
spreading environmental protective and energy-saving 
technologies. We will initiate the legislation of modern and 
strict laws for the protection of nature and the environment; we 
will particularly support the information and educational 
programs connected with environmental protection. 
  We regard the development of backward areas and the easing 
of 
problems of village areas with critical employment and supply 
conditins as basic tasks, and we also attribute great importance 
to avoiding the extreme division of the country. We will set up 
institutions of regional coordination in charge of working out 
local and regional development programs. We want to create a 
harmony between initiatives based on local resources and efforts 
and the central development programs. We will initiate the 
legislation of a law on regional conditions and tasks as soon as 
possible. 
<H3>  A Just Distribution of Public Burdens and A More Thrifty 
State Budget! </H3>
  We think it is just when everyone shares in public burdens 
in 
accordance with one's ability. Within the tax system, we want 
to reduce the burden of personal income tax and increase the 
percentage of consumer taxes. This would make it more difficult 
to avoid taxes. We will considerably increase the corporate 
tax, and we will make the invested incomes free of tax; however, 
we will tax the accumulation of property. We will eliminate the 
tax on the interest on forint and hard currency saving accounts 
and the minimum tax, and we will restore the tax exemptions 
encouraging the foreign investors. We will reduce the 
exceptions and benefits. Along with reducing the central taxes, 
we will increase the right of local government bodies to levy 
taxes. 
  Today two-thirds of the income is taken by the budget. This 
is an unbearably high percentage, but it can only be reduced 
gradually. We want to pay particular attention to the reform of 
state administration and to the reduction of expenses, deficit, 
and income withdrawal. We will primarily save on wasteful and 
inefficient political, state power and administrative expenses. 
  We want to stabilize the tax system in order to create a 
predictable economic environment. It will be impossible to 
carry out a considerable tax reduction in the next four years, 
but it is possible to avoid the increase in taxes. The social 
security payments that seriously burden wages can only be 
reduced gradually, along with the reorganization of the welfare 
system and the development of supplementary insurance. 
<H5>  A Stronger Social Security! </H5>
  The source of the most severe tensions in the coming years 
is 
that welfare expenses can only increase slightly. However, the 
burdens of the most helpless strata of the society cannot be 
increased any more. Therefore, we need a reorganization of the 
welfare system in which help really reaches those eligible to 
get such help. 
  Instead of the humiliating eligibility investigations, the 
conditions of social welfare must be regulated by laws and local 
rules. By modifying the welfare law, we want to increase the 
basic social rights and expand the circle of recipients. Within 
the welfare expenses, we will curb the bureaucratic 
administrative and supervision expenses. We want to encourage 
the welfare activity of various civil organizations 
(associations, foundations, church services, and so on) by tax 
exemptions. 
  We want to preserve the real value of family allowances 
among 
the low and middle strata of the population. We will make the 
child- care benefits a citizen right, and an active grandparent 
who accepts the rearing of a child will also be able to get such 
benefits. We think that it is correct for the families to 
receive support, rather than the institutions, if these families 
enroll their children in nurseries and kindergartens. 
  We intend to take preventive measures for the benefit of 
children and youngsters living in an endangered environment. We 
will strengthen both the legal and institutional background of 
the bodies in charge of this and of the follow-up care. 
  The social security self-governing bodies are the 
independent 
and responsible organizations of social security. We will 
strengthen their role by providing them property and broadening 
their rights. 
  We want to make sure that pensions at least increase 
simultaneously with the net average salaries. We will guarantee 
income supplements as citizens' rights to people over 70 years 
of age who totally or partially lack any care. We will 
gradually introduce a widows pension supplement. We will 
introduce delaying measures for the benefit of women most 
affected by the increased retirement age. We will work out a 
flexible system of retirement, so that the people in question 
can choose the most favorable of the given alternatives. 
  We are fighting against poverty, not against prosperity. 
However, the process of pauperization can be halted at the end 
of the next government period at the earliest. Poverty that 
humiliates human dignity is everyone's shame. The economy 
cannot get into such a situation that anyone starves or freezes 
in the street. We regard the need for the society to jointly 
and obligatorily help its fallen members as a minimum of human 
solidarity. 
  Everyone has the right to basic health care. We want to 
guarantee the circle and quality of services within the 
compulsory health insurance by law. It is essential to settle 
the financial situation of health-care institutions and the 
wages of health workers. We will help the creation of private 
practices and the operation of other health and welfare ventures 
with adequate credits and tax exemptions. We will initiate a 
national cooperation in preventing illnesses leading to early 
death or physical impairment and in encouraging and spreading a 
healthy way of life. 
<H5>  A Chance for Sports! </H5>
  We regard physical exercise as an important part of a 
healthy 
way of life. Therefore, first of all, we want to settle the 
legal situation and ownership of the sports associations in 
order to save the competitive sports, the student, and 
leisure-time sports. We suggest that the sport clubs receive 
the facilities they use in the form of public foundations. We 
suggest that both private persons and economic units be able to 
deduct their support for sports from their taxes. 
  We initiate the legislation of a sports law that will put 
the 
entire issue in a uniform framework and will create 
institutional conditions for the development of competitive 
sports, student sports, and leisure sports. 
<H5>  Housing Also for People With Low Incomes! </H5>
  We will work out a system of housing support that will 
provide two-thirds of the relevant state funds to low-income 
families. We will help the construction of new housing projects 
with full reimbursement of value added tax. 
  We suggest that the state should provide support to local 
government bodies for the development of plots with public 
utilities suitable for housing construction and for the 
construction of social housing. We will help young people 
acquire their first housing with new and advantageous credits. 
We find it extremely important to spread the housing management 
ventures in towns, something that serves the mobility of the 
population. We want to support the construction of family 
houses that guarantee several generations living together. We 
will encourage this program with adequate credits, tax benefits, 
and proper inheritance rules. 
<H5>  A Modern and Democratic Education! </H5>
  As a basic condition of modernization, education is one of 
the breaking points where we must focus the available resources. 
In the wake of the state administration reform, we will halt 
the decrease in the real value of educational expenditures by 
1996, and we will gradually increase it later. 
  We want to increase the duration of the general and uniform 
basic education, and provide increasingly broader chances for 
secondary education. With the introduction of new training 
forms, we want to guarantee studies in vocational institutions 
and institutions of higher education for an increased number of 
young people older than the compulsory schooling age. 
  We want to stabilize the schooling system. We will support 
new institutional forms that exclude the need for an early 
career and school choice, reduce the division of families 
according to their financial situation, and guarantee the 
progress of talented children. It is our basic goal to provide 
school textbooks free of charge to children in a disadvantageous 
situation. We will take measures to expand the supply of cheap 
catering for students. In higher education, we will provide 
social scholarships and exemption from tuition fees for students 
in need. 
  We support the extension of the freedom of instruction. 
According to the social demands, needs, and support, we regard 
the strengthening of church and private schools as important. 
At the same time, we think it is the obligation of the state to 
guarantee an ideologically-neutral education. We oppose the 
instruction of religion or any other organized activity based on 
ideology in state schools. 
  We will eliminate the Educational District Instruction 
Centers, and will restore the independence of public education 
institutions, colleges and universities. We will make sure that 
the state can only appoint leaders to the state institutions who 
enjoy the support of most of the teachers and most of the 
council members of the respective college or university. We 
regard the ability of the educational institutions to use their 
own property freely as a guarantee of the autonomy of higher 
education. We regard the improvement in the training, 
retraining, and living and working conditions of the teachers as 
essential. We will assert the rights of student bodies by 
creating the necessary conditions. 
<H5>  National and Universal Values in Culture! </H5>
  We want to serve Hungary's spiritual prosperity and the 
preservation of our national culture. Our goal is to develop a 
spiritual environment and social public mood in this country 
that is favorable to the acceptance of an intellectual role 
suitable for a modern society at the turn of the century, namely 
to contribute to the financial and spiritual prosperity of the 
entire nation by enriching culture in the widest sense of the 
word, to make it open to anything new and thus help laying the 
foundations of our prosperity, and to constantly signal the 
disturbances in the functioning of the society and the mistakes 
of the prevailing government. 
  We want to guarantee the complete freedom of culture, namely 
of knowledge, research, arts, religion, publication, and 
creation. The state cannot interfere in the culture as a guider 
in any way whatsoever. However, it is the task of the state to 
maintain the national institutions, guarantee their operational 
conditions, and work out the legal regulations regarding 
cultural activity. Cultural centers, libraries, and some of the 
other institutions engaged in the spreading of culture have 
preserved their ability to function so far. It is also a task 
for the state and the local bodies to continue to maintain these 
institutions and to restore and save those in danger. We are 
urging, and we will encourage with tax benefits, the 
contribution of local government bodies, public foundations, 
civil organizations, private persons, and economic units in 
supporting culture. 
  We regard the freedom and independence of scientific and 
technical research as a natural condition. We support the 
independence and democratic structural reorganization of the 
Hungarian Academy of Sciences. 
  The Hungarian Radio and the Hungarian Television will 
continue to play a special role in informing, educating, 
entertaining the population, and in exercising a democratic 
control over the government. On the basis of the bitter 
experience of the past two years, we think that a law separating 
the mass media from the prevailing government, political forces 
and balance of power will guarantee an objective, multilateral, 
and clear information. We find state ownership over the press 
incompatible with the freedom of the press. 
<H5>  Independent Churches and Free Religious Life </H5>
  Spiritual freedom means the freedom of religious people and 
non- religious people alike. We respect the independence of the 
churches: They should be independent of the state and should 
not engage in the political struggle on either side. 
  We highly appreciate the role of the churches in supporting 
the ill, the old, and the fallen, and we acknowledge their 
activity in education. The churches must also receive budget 
support for this. 
  We fully accept the rights of the churches to have their 
property restored. Our goal is to see to it that that this 
process takes place as soon as possible, to the extent of public 
support and actual church activity, with the consideration of 
material and financial conditions, and by coordinating the 
different interests. We want to assert the spiritual and 
religious freedom and the peaceful coexistence of believers and 
non-believers in everyday practice in cooperation with the 
churches. 
<H5>  Public Security </H5>
  We find it particularly important that the citizens feel 
that 
they, their families, and their property are safe. The defense 
of life and values precedes every other task. For this, it is 
essential to increase the number of policemen, improve their 
professional training and technical equipment, and provide 
financial appreciation of the police staff. 
  We need a firm, but not a violent, police. It is expedient 
to shift some of the tasks related to public road control and 
administration to the local government bodies and give them 
rights with which they can influence and control the activity of 
the police. The aforementioned changes can only lead to results 
if society supports the cause of public safety and the various 
civil organizations help this cause. 

<H5>    A More Complete Democracy and a Cheaper State! </H5>
  There is no, nor can there be, political interest for us the 
assertion of which could precede the values of parliamentary 
democracy. We consistently defend the principles of a 
constitutional state, the democratic institutions, and the 
human, national minority, social, and cultural rights. We want 
a firm bourgeois democratic regime. We want to formulate the 
foundations of such a regime in a new constitution that 
expresses the requirements of a social constitutional state. 
  We will attribute greater role than hitherto to the direct 
forms of democracy, to the participation of citizens and their 
communities in the decisions. In accordance with the 
requirements of social partnership, we will systematize public 
dialogue in the legislative process. We want to create a system 
of public supervision and control over public foundations 
created by the government. 
  We want parliament to play a genuine role in supervising the 
government and we want to strengthen the Parliament's character 
of shaping policy. We want to declare the assertion of 
ministerial responsibility in the form of a law. 
  We want to broaden the role of the president of the 
republic, 
and we find it necessary to create his independent tasks and 
authority. We suggest to eliminate the uncertainty prevailing in 
the president's constitutional status. We will initiate the 
direct election of major public figures by the citizens. 
  We find it essential to assert the independence of judges 
and 
of their power. We think it is correct if judges decide on 
their leaders. 
  We want and offer a more thrifty, professional, and 
efficient 
government and public administration. We will limit the 
spreading of government bureaucracy. At the same time, we want 
to increase the freedom and responsibility of citizens and their 
communities, civil organizations, and self-government bodies. 
We will cut bureaucratic expenses considerably: We will 
initiate the elimination of compensation offices, decentralized 
government offices, and some ministries, or the reduction of 
their personnel. We will reexamine the position of minister 
without portfolio. However, we will strengthen the organization 
of justice administration, police, customs, and tax authorities. 
  We need non-party-affiliated public servants independent of 
government changes, civil officers who deserve social and 
financial appreciation on the basis of their professional 
knowledge and honesty. We must finally do away with the 
property-hoarding personnel policy. 
  Our goal is to develop self-government bodies that serve the 
citizens. For this, we will initiate the modification of the 
law on self-government bodies. We find the direct election of 
mayors and the expansion of the authority of local referenda 
justified. We want to eliminate the regional institution of 
republic commissioner; a small county office is sufficient to 
replace the republic commissioner. At the same time, we want to 
strengthen the role of elected county bodies. 
  We will continue to play an initiative role in the assertion 
of the individual and community rights of national minorities 
living in Hungary and in the consistent implementation of the 
law on national minorities. We support the creation of national 
minority self- government bodies and a change in the national 
minority education. We will pay particular attention to 
supporting the relevant efforts of the Gypsy population. 
  We think that a smaller army than today is necessary, one 
gradually modernizing, an armed force respected and appreciated 
by the society, an army that carries out Hungary's defense with 
a well- trained staff free of politics and subordinated to the 
country's interests. Just as it is natural that the 
organizational order of the Army is based on strict discipline 
and relations of subordinates and superiors, the same way we can 
expect that human rights are fully implemented in the Army. We 
will attribute particular attention to supporting such efforts 
by the Gypsy population. 
<H3>  Rapprochement With Our Neighbors and Living As Hungarians in 
Europe </H3>
  We offer a historical rapprochement and reconciliation to 
Hungary's neighbors. In our foreign policy, there is no place 
for reminding of historical grievances, a mission awareness, or 
ideological considerations. We are ready for clarifying debates 
and new initiatives in order to lay the foundations of good 
neighborly relations. We want to trade, rather than engage in 
litigations. 
  We think that the security and stability of Central and 
Eastern Europe can be strengthened by confirming the borders in 
the international law and fully asserting the rights of national 
minorities. We find it essential to mutually build confidence, 
develop bilateral relations and regional cooperation, and to 
make the borders open. We want to serve the full assertion of 
the rights of Hungarians living abroad and the acceptance of 
autonomy efforts in harmony with European norms with a firm and 
calm policy. We will continue to take a stand at international 
forums for the creation of an efficient system of national 
minority protection. 
  We can only guarantee the foreign resources and markets 
indispensable for the development of the Hungarian economy if 
Hungary becomes full member of the European Union. The domestic 
conditions for joining the European Union must be created as 
soon as possible. It is necessary to further develop Hungary's 
relations with NATO, but NATO-membership is not the only 
possible guarantee for Hungary's security. A referendum must 
decide on joining the European Union and NATO. 
  The Hungarian Socialist Party relies on the best traditions 
of the 1,100-year past of this nation, the lively political and 
spiritual heritage of the great figures of our nation, and on 
the current special historical possibility in which the people 
can decide on their own fate. The MSZP wants to serve the 
citizens, and does not ask services from them. The MSZP 
promises, but does not keep promising. 
  In harmony with the aforementioned political program, we 
formulated our concrete, detailed, and professionally-founded 
ideas that could provide the basis of government activity. If 
we gain the voters' confidences, we will count not only on those 
who voted for us, because we need the support of every Hungarian 
citizen for solving the tasks of coming years. The next 
government will not receive a 100-day period of grace, because 
Hungary's situation demands immediate action. 
  We call for social peace. Crisis management needs consensus: 
on a clear agreement between the government and society on the 
goals to be attained, on the distribution of burdens, and on 
compensation to be given to those whose interests are hurt. We 
need a consensus between generations according to which the 
current generations will not be sacrificed on the altar of the 
future, and future generations will not become victims of the 
present either. We cannot promise exemption from difficulties 
for the young people, but we can promise a predictable future. 
  No government can work wonders. However, the Socialists 
would start this country on the road leading out of this crisis 
and we would get over the hard part by the end of the government 
period, by 1998. We promise an honest, professional, calm, and 
rational government that takes every citizen into consideration 
as an individual, and we promise protection to the fallen, 
reduction of uncertainty and helplessness, and the suppression 
of corruption. 
  The democratic left based on social democratic values is 
capable of achieving these goals. This political force 
simultaneously represents the freedom that creates democracy, 
equality of chances based on justice, and solidarity that 
expresses brotherhood. 
  The stakes are very high: Whether we will succeed in laying 
the foundations for Hungary's progress in the coming four years, 
or we will helplessly drift to the level of the third world. 
The MSZP does not promise salvation; it offers a solution. 
The MSZP Congress.

  [Text] The Socialist Party of Labor [PSM] is not involved 
in the current government reshuffle, which was fully carried out 
by the ruling party, PSM Vice President Tudor Mohora said at a 
news conference held in Bucharest today. We consider this 
reshuffle to be a measure taken in accordance with 
constitutional standards. This is not only the result of the 
choice of the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], but also 
of the pressure applied by the parties of the parliamentary 
coalition, including the PSM, which demanded that urgent steps 
should be taken to improve the overall governmental activity. 
We will only support this government if concrete steps are 
taken to implement a coherent governmental program, Mr. Mohora 
said. 
  In connection with the elections in the Republic of Moldova, 
Senator Adrian Paunescu [PSM vice president] said: We must 
examine the newly created situation with lucidity and realism. 
In this respect, he pointed out that, quote, we are also to be 
partly blamed for this situation because of our inability to 
unite on major issues; therefore, it is necessary to work out a 
sole national strategy, which goes beyond party interests, Mr. 
Paunescu said. 
  In another order of ideas, the participants in today's news 
conference told the journalists that a PSM delegation 
participated as guests in the 25-27 February Congress of the 
Socialist Party of the Working People of Russia. On that 
occasion the delegation also participated in a roundtable on the 
following subject: The Socialist Idea Yesterday, Today, and 
Tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The UDMR Offensive"] </F>
  [Text] The 26-27 February meeting of the Council of 
Representatives of the UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in 
Romania], which was held in Miercurea Ciuc, adopted a 
declaration regarding the way in which Romania's obligations 
stipulated by the amendments of the Council of Europe with 
respect to the status of ethnic minorities should be complied 
with. 
  Assessing that "Romania's authorities are not observing 
these 
amendments and are not displaying the political will to accept 
and implement them," the signatories of the declaration reassert 
the ethnic minorities' right to have their own local 
self-administration bodies and a special status in the areas 
where they represent the majority of the population, and 
recommend that local administration bodies should be summoned 
within two months to decide upon the forms of autonomy that 
should be applied, as formulated in the UDMR program and in its 
draft bill on the status of the ethnic minorities and autonomous 
communities. The declaration also protests the draft bill on 
education, which has already been accepted by the Education 
Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, as well as the measures 
taken by certain county prefects annulling the decisions of 
local bodies regarding bilingual inscriptions, and requests that 
in the areas preponderantly inhabited by ethnic minorities they 
should be allowed to use their mother tongue in justice and 
administration. 
  In that context the declaration asks Romania's Parliament to 
sign the European Charter on Local Self-Administration, accept 
the UDMR amendments to the education bill, and put on the agenda 
the draft bill on the status of ethnic minorities and autonomous 
communities.

  [Text] Yesterday at around noon Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu signed the appointment of the chairman of the 
Privatization Agency, an office that is equivalent to that of a 
state secretary. The person who was appointed is Iacob Zelenco, 
who from September 1993 to 3 March 1994 was the prime minister's 
counselor. 
  Iacob Zelenco worked for over 17 years at the Ministry of 
Finance, where he used to coordinate the work of the state 
budget income departments, while after the revolution [December 
1989] he led the department for prices at the same ministry. 
For a while he was the deputy of Nicolae Vacaroiu. 
  In a brief statement that he made yesterday exclusively for 
our paper, Zelenco stressed: "I hope I can do some concrete 
things to boost privatization. Over the past three years there 
has been a great deal of talk about it, but we need to make 
privatization become tangible for our citizens."

as commander of the 4th [Transylvanian] Army. 
  Spiroiu said that General Cheler is still commander of that 
army and there are no problems whatsoever. This report is 
false, the defense minister asserted, after which he assessed 
that such misleading information is also intended to create an 
unfavorable atmosphere around the leadership of the ministry.

<F P=106> [Report by Enes Osmancevic from Tuzla] </F>
  [Text] Early this morning units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army left the area of Dubrave [Tuzla] Airport and at 1300 Tuzla 
airport was officially handed over to the UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR]. This was done by signing an agreement between the 
representatives of our republican authorities and UNPROFOR, that 
is to say, UN officials. 
  Although members of the Nordic Battalion took over control 
of 
Tuzla airport yesterday, UNPROFOR will be officially accountable 
for the safety of the airport, which has been under its control 
for several hours, as of today. 
  To recap, approximately 300 soldiers of the Nordic Battalion 
took up positions to secure the airport in the course of 
yesterday. Six Leopard tanks are positioned in the vicinity of 
the runway, which have the authority to protect this airport by 
force if need be, that is to say, to respond to possible fire 
from the Serbian aggressor's positions with fire. 
  It is worth mentioning once again that the runway has been 
ready to receive aircraft for over 18 months. We have learned 
unofficially that as of today all other preparations to make 
Tuzla airport operational have been accelerated. 
  Official forecasts say that this should happen on 18 March; 
however, sources close to UNPROFOR anticipate that it might 
happen before this date.

<F P=106> [Report by Alain Bommenel] </F>
  [Text] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, March 8 (AFP) -- UN 
peacekeepers now guarding Tuzla's military airport must clear 
the area of mines and tighten security before the resumption of 
aid flights in a few weeks, officers said on Tuesday. 
  Barely 24 hours after taking control of the airfield, the 
140 
Swedish and Danish troops under the command of the UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) have deployed across the north-east base, 
ensuring around-the-clock security along the 2,400-metre 
(3,000-yard) runway. 
  The bid to open the airfield to humanitarian flights for the 
first time in 23 months of war, in an operation codenamed 
Pegasus, is to officially begin at noon Tuesday. It follows an 
agreement by Bosnian Serbs encircling the area to allow two air 
corridors into the Moslem-held city airport. 
  Backed by machinegun-mounted armoured troop carriers and six 
Leopard tanks, they have been instructed to watch movements by 
Bosnian Serb forces dug in eight kilometres (five miles) away 
but in a direct line with the runway, which can take heavy 
transport aircraft. 
  The men must also pinpoint attempts to infiltrate the 
airfield perimetre, seven kilometres (4.2 miles) long. "I don't 
want to see flocks of sheep on the runway when the planes begin 
to land," an officer said. 
  But one of the top priorities for now is to clear the field 
of mines. "This military base has been mined three times," said 
the Swedish commander Magnus Lavman. 
  The army of former Yugoslavia laid mines, especially 
anti-tank devices, when the airport was built. It has remained 
in disuse since 1992 when troops avacuating the field 
booby-trapped the airport and commandeered its technical 
equipment and fighter planes, including MIGs. Last year, troops 
from the mainly-Moslem Bosnian army fearing attacks from enemy 
Bosnian Serbs laid new mines in the woods surrounding the field. 
French bomb disposal experts have already been ordered to the 
base. 
  A first military plane carrying technical equipment is 
expected within five to seven days. "We must move swiftly. The 
UN's credibility is at stake," one western officer said. During 
the first stages of the operation, UNPROFOR planes alone will 
land on the runway. The Russian-built Ilyushin 76s, Antonov 32s 
and Yakovlev 40s are to transport electronic, fire-fighting and 
loading and unloading equipment to be used for the relief 
flights. 
  Once this part of the operation is complete, within several 
weeks, UNPROFOR will have to establish flight approach routes to 
avoid over-flying combat zones. When the field has been secured 
and equipped, transport planes carrying aid for the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will be able to start bringing 
in relief. The relief flights will enable much-needed supplies 
to reach some 700,000 people, most of them refugees who fled 
from other areas and have been surviving on deliveries made by 
road convoys that cover only 30 percent of their needs. Aid 
flights are to come in from Zagreb and the Croatian port of 
Split under an agreement between the United Nations and the 
Bosnian Serbs. The airport is located about 15 kilometers (nine 
miles) from Tuzla.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, March 8 (AFP) -- A ceasefire accord 
between Bosnia's Moslems and Croats was holding Tuesday as UN 
troops patrolled 350 kilometres (210 miles) of front lines and 
collected heavy weaponry, Radio Sarajevo reported. [passage 
omitted] 
  Sarajevo radio said that both Moslems and Croats were 
pulling 
back heavy weapons 10 kilometres (six miles) from the front 
lines in central and southern Bosnia and tanks and artillery 
weapons were pulled back 20 kilometres (12 miles.) UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) officials said however that it would take them 
several more days before all the weapons were withdrawn or 
placed under UN control. 
  The ceasefire agreement, patterned after a similar truce for 
Sarajevo, was signed last week in Washington and is part of an 
overall accord between Bosnia's Moslems and Croats to form a 
loose federation. 
  The two sides on Monday also agreed to a prison exchange in 
the central Bosnian tows of Busovaca, Travnik and Vitez, the 
radio said without providing a specific date for the exchange or 
the number of prisoners involved. [passage omitted] 
  The Moslem-Croat negotiations meanwhile that started at the 
US Embassy in Vienna last Friday resumed there Tuesday. The head 
of the Moslem delegation, Bosnian Justice Minister Kasem Trnka, 
said talks were being held in a "good atmosphere" and "the 
question of the constitution (for the new federation) should be 
concluded tonight."

  [Text] Belgrade, March 7 (TANJUG)--The Bosnian Croat army 
command in Vitez, central Bosnia, on Monday protested with the 
U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) against the local Moslems' 
violations of the February 25 ceasefire agreement. 
  Moslem forces have disregarded the Monday noon deadline for 
withdrawal and have not placed their heavy weapons under 
control, Zagreb-based Croatian radio quotes a statement released 
by the Croat command as saying. 
  The radio said that Moslem troops had torched six Croat 
houses in the vicinity of Vitez on Monday. Fierce fighting 
between Moslems and Croats, erstwhile allies against Bosnian 
Serbs, has been raging since early 1993 in the central and 
southern parts of the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Representatives of Bosnian Croats and Moslems and of 
neighbouring Croatia, acting under strong U.S. pressure, signed 
a framework agreement in Washington on March 1 undertaking to 
form a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, 
the agreement has failed to curb the Moslem-Croat war.

<F P=106> [Report by Zdenko Vranjes] </F>
  [Excerpts] Mostar has been completely peaceful today. 
[passage omitted] 
  Croatian Defense Council [HVO] formations in the Lasva river 
valley have placed their heavy guns under UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] supervision at the UN base in Bila, in the 
municipality of Vitez, but HVO military sources said that the 
same action was not taken by Muslim soldiers. The command of 
the HVO Vitez operational zone lodged a protest with UNPROFOR 
because the Muslim side in that area had not placed a single gun 
under UNPROFOR supervision. [passage omitted] 
  Herceg-Bosna Prime Minister Jadranko Prlic and Chamber of 
Deputies President Ivan Bender had talks with French Ambassador 
Henri Jacolin today. In their talks they put forward a demand 
for Mostar not to be placed under European Union administration 
but to be included in the Croat Grand County, with a separate

by the Croat side that the Croat Grand County be given a land 
link with Herzegovina.

  [Text] By 1200 the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] units had 
fully implemented the agreement between [Bosnian Croat army 
commander] General Roso and [Bosnian Army commander General 
Rasim] Delic. Under the agreement, all heavy weapons of more 
than 12.7-mm caliber are to be placed under control of UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] or redeployed at an agreed distance from 
the line of separation. Part of the weapons have been moved to 
the agreed location, which is under the control of UNPROFOR and 
HVO soldiers, while the other location is under HVO control 
only. After 1200 UNPROFOR members began a tour of artillery 
positions and the line of separation, HVO spokesman Veso Vegar 
has reported.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic </F>
by A.J. in Trieste; date not given: "We Are Trying To Convince 
the Serbs With a Swiss Model"] 
  [Text] Following the Trieste conference of the 
Central European Initiative, Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic 
gave an interview to MAGYAR NEMZET. 
  [A.J.] At this conference in Trieste, an impression has been 
formed that you are much more optimistic about the chances of 
Bosnian peace than you were before. On what do you base this? 
  [Ljubijankic] We have indeed become more optimistic, which 
is mainly due to two developments. First, the deployment of the 
NATO planes, and because the Atlantic Alliance has given an 
ultimatum to the Serbs. The other factor giving hope to us is 
the Washington agreement between the Croatians and Bosnians on 
the structure of Bosnia and the division of responsibility, and 
the agreement on the confederation between Croatia and the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [A.J.] How can these agreements promote peace? 
  [Ljubijankic] This way, we will be in a better position on 
the front against the Serbs; this way, we have gained a stronger 
position against the Serbian expansion that we have seen over 
the past three years. 
  [A.J.] Do you think that this way you will be able to drive 
back the Bosnian Serbs from the areas that they have occupied 
illegally? 
  [Ljubijankic] These areas are not theirs and have never been 
theirs. We continue to emphasize that this is not a civil war 
and it is a big mistake to see it as such. This has always been 
an aggressive war in the course of which pseudo-states have been 
set up in Croatia and Bosnia as a first step to annexing them to 
Serbia. The international community has to recognize this 
intent. Now, as a result of these developments, we can 
negotiate from a better position than before. This is how I 
mean our stronger position: As NATO has at long last begun to 
talk language that the Serbs understand, it will be easier to 
negotiate with them. 
  [A.J.] Does the Croatian-Bosnian confederation mean a tacit 
acceptance of Bosnia's division and giving up the country's 
unity? 
  [Ljubijankic] We will never give up Bosnia's unity. 
However, this way, we establish a high-level example of local 
governments and local autonomy, thus even creating a kind of 
model that can be found in Switzerland or perhaps in other 
European countries, for example Belgium. 
  [A.J.] Are you trying to "recapture" the Serbs through this 
model so that they will join you in the future in a new Bosnia? 
  [Ljubijankic] I am not as optimistic as this regarding the 
Serbs, but we have to continue the practice that convinces them 
and the rest of the world that this viral infection of national 
socialism has to be defeated. In my view, without proving this, 
no one will be able to convince the Serbs to live in Bosnia. 
The Serbs have never been in the Vojvodina, but they are there 
now; they have never been on the left bank of the Drina River, 
and now they are there, too. This expansion should be stopped. 
  [A.J.] Do you therefore believe that the peace that can now 
be achieved is only temporary and not a final settlement? 
  [Ljubijankic] I would prefer to use the term creating an 
example to temporary peace. However, real peace does not exist 
if it is not just. Therefore, this is the first step toward 
establishing a just peace. 
  [A.J.] Shall we just call this a cease-fire? 
  [Ljubijanic] Yes, this can be seen as a kind of cease-fire.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Kasim Begic, chairman of the </F>
Economic Council of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government and 
participant in the work of the Transitory Committee for 
Developing and Implementing the General Agreement on 
establishing the federation, by Mehmed Agovic on 4 March; place 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Begic] From an economic viewpoint, the general 
agreement on establishing the federation deserves support at 
this stage of the talks because these solutions are basically on 
the verge of achieving two general effects. First, regarding 
the allocation of economic authority between the center and the 
cantons, accepted are those solutions that are typical for a 
usual federal setup of modern states -- on the one hand, kept at 
the central level are those solutions that ensure an unified 
economic-social system with unified money, freedom of the flow 
of goods, factors of economic operations, monetary and fiscal 
policy, and so on, and on the other, in allocating economic 
authority solutions also typical for federal states in the 
modern times are accepted, which means that apart from the 
separate powers of the center and the cantons, also accepted are 
joint engagements of the two levels of authority. Second, such 
solutions also create a basis for adequately realizing 
agreements with political, social, and other non-economic 
characteristics, which means that a basis is also thereby 
created for outlining the draft of the constitution of the 
federation, the work of which should start today. 
  [Agovic] What does this economic concept mean for the third 
side, which is not included in this agreement -- the Serbian 
side? Can (?this) be a kind of integrative (?link)? 
  [Begic] I must stress that the solutions that have been 
envisaged in this agreement are to a great extent identical to 
solutions that were offered at the initial Geneva negotiations 
by the legitimate bodies of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Namely, our 
official proposal within the framework of the peace plan was to 
try a federal setup of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, these 
solutions are to a great extent identical to our proposal from 
July 1993 and these solutions were offered for the entire 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which means that such solutions from this 
agreement are also creating a basis for this so-called third 
side, for it to be able to join this agreement in a way and do 
so in a very short period. 
  [Agovic] The Republic of Croatia is also included in this 
entire arrangement. What is this problem like? 
  [Begic] I must say that the framework of the preliminary 
agreement, which envisages the founding of a confederation 
between the Bosnian federation -- that is, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- 
and Croatia in an economic aspect and seen from present angle of 
vision, above all, contains a lot of optimistic and, I could 
even say, unrealistic content. Namely, this preliminary 
agreement, among other things, envisages the creation of a 
customs-monetary union, which already addresses elements of a 
special state entity. The fact that it sounds too optimistic as 
the prerequisite for joining a confederation between two 
sovereign states is, above all, an adequate constitutional setup 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, only when the work on the 
constitution of the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina is near 
completion will it be possible to assess the scope of the 
offered preliminary agreement on creating a confederation 
between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. 
  [Agovic] You are leaving for Vienna this evening to take 
part in the work of the committee for drafting these documents. 
Would this be a sufficient basis for doing so? 
  [Begic] The basis is good. I hope that the Transitory 
Committee, in whose work I will take part, will be able to 
continue along this good path that the Washington papers have 
offered and I hope that this will be a key to peace for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, today received Sukru Tufan, the Turkish 
ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  I am honored that Mr. Izetbegovic found time to receive me 
and I am satisfied with the very useful talks today on the 
current events concerning the denouement of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. This was stated by Ambassador Tufan 
for B-H Press. We exchanged views of the Washington agreement 
and the cease-fire in Sarajevo. We also discussed the 
participation of the Turkish forces as part of UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] units. We will soon establish the mechanism 
for permanent political consultations between the leaderships of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Turkey, the Turkish ambassador said. 
Ambassador Sukru Tufan expressed the hope that the numerous 
positive steps taken recently would lead to the final peace. 
  We consider the agreement between the Bosniaks and the 
Croats 
as a major and significant step. We hope that the talks in 
Vienna will continue in the direction of preserving a pluralist 
character of Bosnia-Herzegovina and that the Serbs will be 
enabled to join such a community. Of course, you must decide on 
the future of your country. Turkey will support the stand of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities, as has been the case from 
the very beginning, Turkish Ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Sukru Tufan said.

  [Text] Mirko Pejanovic, member of the state presidency, 
today held talks with Sukru Tufan, Turkish ambassador to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, on the denouement of the situation in our 
country. After the talks, Ambassador Tufan briefly stated that 
they discussed the new, real denouement of the situation, 
especially after the signing of the federation agreement between 
the Bosnian and Croatian sides. Tufan stressed that attempts 
are being made to find a model according to which the Serbian 
side would also be included in the agreement on the federal 
organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina that has already been signed. 
  Mirko Pejanovic, member of the state presidency, stressed 
the 
need for the further involvement of Turkey as a friendly country 
in the settlement of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Pejanovic said the following: 
  I believe that the (?talks) with the Turkish representatives 
will be of great importance for the implementation of the 
federation agreement in Bosnia-Herzegovina and confederation 
with the neighboring Republic of Croatia, as well as a possible 
participation of the Serbian people in the implementation of the 
agreement. 
  This was stated by Mirko Pejanovic, member of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency.

  [Text] President Izetbegovic has sent a letter to the UN 
Security Council regarding the situation in Srebrenica. 
  Srebrenica, which was declared a protected zone by Security 
Council Resolutions 824 and 836, had been quiet for some time. 
However, the Serbian aggressor has recently started attacking 
the town again and is brutally violating the obligations 
contained in these resolutions. 
  Exploiting the changeover of two contingents of peace 
forces, 
Karadzic's Serbs occupied the villages of Tjeskovici, Ursici, 
Jasenovo, and Podravanje on 2, 3, and 4 March. These villages 
are inside the protected zone. On the night of 4-5 March, they 
attacked the camp settlement in Slapovici. The settlement is 
being built with the donations of the Swedish and Norwegian 
Governments. In doing so, they killed and captured a fairly 
large number of civilians. Approximately 1,000 people who moved 
in in the finished part of the settlement were forced to flee 
toward the town. 
  It transpires from the aforementioned facts that the Serbian 
aggressor is continuing to ignore all the decisions of the 
international community. On the other hand, UNPROFOR [United 
Nations Protected Forces] is unable to effectively protect the 
civilian population in the demilitarized zone of Srebrenica. 
  Esteemed sir, we beg you that the Security Council take 
appropriate measures so that the units of Karadzic's Serbs 
withdraw to the previous lines of the protected Srebrenica zone 
and ensure firmer control of the situation on the ground so that 
the refugees could at least be guaranteed elementary safety in 
their settlements.

  [Excerpt] Bosnia's Muslim leaders are trying to end the 
protest against the departure of Canadian peacekeepers from 
Srebrenica. The Canadians have ended their tour of duty in the 
mainly Muslim enclave (?and been relieved) by Dutch troops. But 
protesting Muslims kept the Canadians from leaving their 
compound this weekend. The Muslims see the Canadians as their 
protectors and don't want them to leave. 
  The departure of the Canadians is also being blocked by 
Serbs 
surrounding Srebrenica. They claim the Canadians' heavy-duty 
vehicles will tear up the road and are preventing a UN convoy 
sent from Visoko from reaching the area. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Following the continuation of the Serbian forces' 
offensive on Maglaj, Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, sent a letter to the chairman 
of the UN Security Council, in which he says the following: 
  The Security Council's Resolution 900 is undoubtedly useful. 
We believe that it will encourage the process of calming the 
armed conflict throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina even more. 
However, it has not yet protected Maglaj, which has been under 
a siege for nine months and has been subjected to a general 
offensive by the Serbian forces in the past month. 
  The aggressor is constantly increasing pressure by 
introducing new weapons withdrawn from around Sarajevo. Several 
tens of thousands of people in the besieged town will not be 
able to put up resistance for much longer against the 
technically incomparably much stronger attacker. 
  The situation is critical and requires an urgent action of 
the Security Council. It is necessary to halt the attacks 
immediately and send international observers and peacekeeping 
troops to the besieged town. Otherwise, there will be another 
genocide. 
  If the international community allows this to happen through 
its passivity, all progress made in the past month would be 
devalued. If, on the other hand, the tragedy of Maglaj is 
prevented with a resolute action, this will give a new impetus 
to the process of establishing peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Esteemed sir, I beg you that the Security Council 
immediately 
adopt a decision appropriate to the gravity of the situation.

  [Excerpts] Banja Luka, 6 Mar (TANJUG) -- Maglaj has not 
been bombed and the so-called army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in 
line with its common practice, has been setting old tires ablaze 
to create an impression that the town was bombed, the 
information service of the First Krajina Corps of the Serb 
Republic Army said in today's statement in Banja Luka. 
  It is a question of the offensive which the so-called 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army began after the Croat-Muslim agreement 
was signed in Washington. The offensive had also been announced 
on several occasions in the media by the chief of their General 
Staff, Army General Rasim Delic, and the chief of the Supreme 
Command, General Sefer Halilovic. 
  The Serb army statement adds that in the past few days the 
Muslim army stepped up the concentration of its forces from the 
117th Muslim brigade, 208th shock Muslim brigade, and of new 
units brought in from Kakanj to the areas of Gracanica and 
Lukavac. Offensive actions have already started against Ozren, 
Trebava, and Doboj. [passage omitted] 
  The statement also warns of a link between the commands of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], 
and also representatives of the EU observer mission staying at 
the Internacional Hotel in Zenica.

  [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, today sent a letter to Lord Owen 
and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the cochairmen of the peace conference 
on Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which he informed them that 
representatives of the Sandzak Muslim National Council -- as the 
legal and legitimate representative of the Bosniak people living 
in the Sandzak Province -- had requested of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina president that they be included in talks on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Bosniaks in Bosnia and Sandzak are one people and have been 
living in the same state since the Berlin Congress in 1878. This 
congress had passed a decision whereby the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
borders were redrawn, Sandzak was separated from Bosnia and 
divided between Serbia and Montenegro. From 1878 to 1945 the 
people of Sandzak were under various forms of pressure and 
emigrated to Bosnia and Turkey. The pressure on Muslims in 
Sandzak increased after the disintegration of Yugoslavia and 
reached its peak during the war in Bosnia. Organized state 
terror against the Bosniak minority has caused a new wave of 
emigration of Muslims from Sandzak not dissimilar to ethnic 
cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The focus of world attention on the tragedy in Bosnia has 
pushed our people outside Bosnia into the background. These 
people are exposed to the terror of the same forces and people 
who had planned and carried out the genocide in Bosnia. 
  Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia are actively involved in the 
Geneva talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this way conditions are 
created for a global settlement of the national status of Serbs 
and Croats, as well as the status of Muslims in former 
Yugoslavia. It is obvious that the issue of the Bosniak people 
outside Bosnia cannot be resolved by temporarily sending a 
working group from Sandzak, which took part in the Conference on 
Former Yugoslavia in London, The Hague, and Geneva. Therefore, 
I think it necessary to accede to the demand of the Sandzak 
Muslim National Council to include representatives of this 
council in the talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina as an interested 
party, we read in President Izetbegovic's letter to the 
cochairmen of the Peace Conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 7 (TANJUG)--Apart from expelling 
Serbs from its territory, Germany is gathering Moslem refugees 
to organize their departure for the ex-Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to join the Bosnian Moslem Army. 
  Citing Bosnian Serb military sources, the news agency of the 
Bosnian Serb Republic (RS)--SRNA, says that the German 
authorities are in this way getting rid of the Moslem refugees 
and, at the same time, enabling the Moslem side to take better 
military positions in the almost two-year civil war in Bosnia. 
  It is clear, a Bosnian Serb military statement said, that 
the 
entire action was completely agreed by Bonn and the Moslem 
authorities in Sarajevo and is carried out in synchronization 
with Bonn's and Washington's efforts to re-establish the 
Moslem-Croat military and diplomatic coalition with unconcealed 
anti-Serb intentions. 
  The Bosnian Croats and Moslems, former allies against the 
Bosnian Serbs, clashed a year ago over territories with a mixed 
population. 
  Last week the two sides met in Washington, at the insistence 
of the United States, and signed a draft agreement on setting up 
a joint federation in Bosnia and a subsequent confederation with 
neighbouring Croatia. 
  On Monday Germany announced it would begin expelling 100,000 
people with Yugoslav passports who are illegally in Germany.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Rasim Cerimagic: "A Hostage to His Own Greed"] </F>
  [Text] The copy has become more clear than the original. 
Tudjman has outdone his own ideal, and Milosevic has become 
owner of not only the Serb souls but "the father of all Croats," 
too. Tudjman has become more of a Serb than Milosevic -- not 
because he wants to, on the contrary. However, he was caught in 
the net he and Milosevic had woven in Karadjordjevo, intending 
it for Bosnia. 
  Like Milosevic, the leader of the Croats did not even 
mention 
the number one world event until his visit to the "friendly 
state of Romania," during which he condescendingly stated that 
the ultimatum may play a certain role in the Bosnian conflict, 
but that the bombing of the Serb positions would lead to an 
escalation of the war -- no less and no more than that. In 
front of the entire international community, including the Serb 
Orthodox mother Russia, Tudjman sides with the almost abandoned 
Karadzic. The Croat leader has irretrievably become hostage to 
Milosevic's stratagem and his own greed for the territory of 
someone else's internationally recognized country. Paradoxical 
or not, the fact is that he now has to save Milosevic by 
defending his part of their joint plan -- wiping Bosnia off the 
world political map. With the removal of the Serb artillery (by 
hook or by crook) from the positions at the Sarajevo 
encirclement, certain -- possibly crucial -- instruments of 
dividing Bosnia in the way that the two had planned and carried 
it out have been taken to pieces. 
  It took the international political and military giant two 
years of unprecedented brutal killing of a small state and a 
people -- the Bosniak one -- to move. Slow reactions are 
characteristic of the internal logic of a huge mechanism. 
However, once the machinery is started, it is constantly 
accelerated and is difficult to bring to a standstill. Tudjman 
feels that the end to the international community policy that 
indifferently acknowledged new "realities on the ground" is 
near. The ultimatum to the Serbs hangs over Croatian policies 
in Bosnia as a heavy lead cloud, too. However, its president, 
who has long ago put everything on one card -- the division of 
Bosnia into two parts -- has gone too deep into its 
blood-stained mire to be able to get out of it. This is why, in 
a state of panic, he gave the statement in Bucharest. 
  Franjo Tudjman must do what is impossible: save the now 
questionable job of breaking Bosnia in two, which is well under 
way, while, with the new, changed attitude of the international 
community, which has been getting into full swing of stopping 
the bloodshed, avoiding economic sanctions or an ultimatum 
similar to the Serb one. Another possibility is going a few 
years back, breaking off the ghostly engagement with Milosevic, 
and giving up on the so-called exclusive Croatia at the expense 
of the neighboring Bosnia. 
  What he is going to opt for can best be discerned in his 
program address to the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] 
Presidency and HDZ representatives in the parliament. Those who 
may still have had illusions or doubts were finally given a 
first-hand answer to the question who the real creators or the 
Croatian policies toward Bosnia are and who are the executors. 
Tudjman did not directly respond to Miko Tripalo's [official of 
the Croatian National Party] accusations, which said that three 
years ago, he had arranged a dual division of Bosnia with 
Milosevic, but said that, regarding Bosnia, he "carried out the 
only possible policy," that he "anticipated and realized," and 
that "our people in Herceg-Bosna and Boban and everyone else 
carried out and will carry out this policy." He swung his 
rhetorical sword before the parliament representatives and 
pointed it even at the pope himself, reproaching him for the 
desire for the establishment of a new community of the Southern 
Slavs. Moreover, says Tudjman, "the pope claims that the cause 
of all the evil in the present-day world is the exaggerated and 
extremist nationalism, for which leaders rather than the people 
are to blame, that nationalism has led to a new paganism -- the 
deification of the state." In that context, Tudjman recognizes 
himself. The pope supporting sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
expressing solidarity with its people who have suffered so much 
suits his politics even less. 
  By imputing this to the Vatican, Croatia is losing its last 
friend. It, therefore, seems that there is no going back for 
Tudjman and Croatia. He has chosen the same loner's way as his 
model Slobodan Milosevic. They are faced with the same future. 
Disputed and isolated by the world, they will be each other's 
only support and solace.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Franjo Tudjman with domestic </F>
and foreign correspondents in the presidential palace in Zagreb 
-- live] 
  [Text] [Tudjman] Despite the fact that the preliminary 
Washington agreement has been received by all people of goodwill 
and all responsible political factors both in the country and in 
the world not only with understanding but also with the 
assessment that it is of great importance -- this agreement to 
bring the war to an end and create the preconditions for a 
lasting peace in this area and create a new international order 
-- there are those who, either for reasons of political 
opportunism or because they do not understand or because of a 
malicious interpretation, want to belittle this agreement and 
even ascribe to it a significance that it does not have [as 
heard]. 
  It could be said that there are two main criticisms. One is 
that this is a turnabout in previous Croatian state policy and 
the policy of the Croatian president, and the second is that 
Croatia has in this way accepted the U.S. diktat. What is our 
position here? Is this a turnabout? 
  Although I have said something about this in my statements, 
nevertheless, precisely because this is being repeated, I too 
will repeat: Croatian state policy, and my own personal policy, 
in fact has consistently prepared for such a solution. 
Remember: We recommended, and I personally did so -- to 
representatives of the Croatian people and to the 
representatives of the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] who were 
elected at the first democratic elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
-- that the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina should take 
part in a referendum for an independent (?Bosnia). 
  After this we did not accept everything and sign everything 
ostensibly offered to us just like that -- as some have said -- 
but we sought solutions which might be in the interests of the 
Croatian people as a whole, in the interests of Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, of the Croatian state, and also of the 
international community in creating peace on the territory of 
the former Yugoslavia in this part of southeast Europe. So we 
were the ones who proposed and gave impetus to acceptance from 
the beginning of a cantonal solution to the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, this was not accepted because the 
Serb side, especially the Serb side, and the Muslim side, did 
not accept this cantonal system. 
  Then it was we who, seeking a solution in those 
circumstances, suggested and accepted Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
organization as a set of provinces, meaning a community or an 
organization of provinces which would suit all three peoples. 
This was not acepted either. This means that on our part it 
was a matter of seeking solutions within the framework of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina which would satisfy all three peoples. This 
was not accepted either. 
  We then went on to find a solution which would be accepted 
-- 
as the world has always said and is still saying today -- which 
would satisfy all three peoples. Later on, in the framework of 
the European conference on the former Yugoslavia, a proposal was 
tabled whereby Bosnia-Herzegovina would be organized as a union 
of three republics. Consequently, in this context of resolving 
the problems, far from being passive observers, we were active 
factors, active subjects in the course of such a solution which 
would save Bosnia- Herzegovina and which would also be in the 
interest of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole 
and in the interest of the protection of the Croatian state's 
strategic interests. 
  From this point of view -- given that solutions were being 
postponed and given that the Croats first faced Serbian 
aggression and then when the Serbian aggression was over and 
when the Serbs had conquered 70 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
territory, when the Muslims turned against the Croats partly 
because of the influence of extremist elements, we were 
supporting and organizing the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
throughout all that time so that they could put up resistance to 
aggression and safeguard Croat interests. 
  Consequently, we also supported the creation of the Croat 
republic of Herceg-Bosna as opposed to the secession of the so- 
called Serb republic and as opposed to the Muslim leadership's 
ambition -- an ambition that was clearly expressed at some 
stages -- to create their independent Muslim state in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Consequently, we supported the creation of 
the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and this was not in the least 
at odds with our continuing initiatives. On the contrary, this 
was geared toward securing Croat interests, toward the creation 
of -- both in a political and a military sense -- a situation 
whereby the interests of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
must be taken into account on the basis of what the Croat people 
had achieved in defending themselves from the aggression. 
  That is enough on whether this is a turnabout or whether 
acceptance of the Washington agreement is in line with the 
Croatian policies Croatia has been pursuing since day one. 
  After all, that can be seen from my letter to President 
Clinton of more than a year ago, from my repeated suggestions 
during talks with Messrs Izetbegovic and Silajdzic and from 
written proposals tabled in Bonn and Petersburg. Therefore, this 
is no turnabout, but a consistent policy implemented by the main 
Croat party in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- which won absolute majority 
of the Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- and by the Croatian 
state leadership and me personally. 
  Concerning the other piece of criticism, that Croatia 
allegedly accepted a diktat, I think that I have already 
answered that too. Croatia has definitely not accepted a diktat 
and, as alleged, sold its interests for some $500 million. 
Croatia's policy has since the very beginning been too 
consistent to accept anyone's diktat or to sell itself for any 
amount of money. But, Croatia's policy and I personally 
accepted with gratitude the involvement by the United States and 
main European countries, and we especially appreciated and 
viewed as a historic event the fact that the United States 
managed to reach an agreement with the main European states and 
that it has taken over the initiative to find this solution of 
the preliminary Washington agreement. 
  The Washington agreement on the creation of a 
Croat-Bosniak-Muslim federation in Bosnia and on federal 
Bosnia-Herzegovina entering a confederal union with Croatia is 
no diktat, but it is in line with the policy we have been 
implementing, which has been and remains in the interest of the 
Croatian people as a whole and the Croatian state. 
  This is all I wanted to say at the beginning of the news 
conference. Feel free to ask me questions. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, you have said that this 
agreement in Washington has received a great deal of attention. 
I would nevertheless like to ask something from a journalistic 
point of view. It has also received a great deal of attention 
from the world media, over 60 TV networks carried shorter or 
longer excerpts from your address. The majority of 
international news agencies did the same. What is your comment 
on this really high level of interest on the part of the world 
media? And also what do you say about the Serb comments which 
say that Croatia has played a winning card and taught the Serbs 
a lesson about how national interests should be protected? 
Thank you. 
  [Tudjman] I have not yet heard these Serb comments. 
Obviously, there is sometimes common sense there too, so things 
are seen as they should be seen. The fact that people in the 
world demonstrate such a high level of interest proves that this 
Yugoslav crisis threatened to fuel the spread of war, that the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis in objective terms was and still is 
one of the most complicated in today's world, and that the world 
sighed with slight relief as the principal factors of the world 
- the European Union [EU] states, the leading states of the EU, 
and the United States in its capacity as the main world power -- 
have at last realized that some more determined steps should be 
taken, that they have agreed on these steps and that, 
consequently, the world has welcomed this agreement as a way out 
of this war and crisis that have been threatening not only to 
spread the method of settling accounts by means of war but also 
to bring about a conflict of civilizations. 
  This is the significance of the agreement not only for us, 
who are directly involved, but for the world too. After all, 
the involvement of the world's and Europe's powers, the United 
States on the one hand and the Russian Federation on the other, 
made it evident that this is not only a matter of drawing 
borders between Croatia and Serbia; Serbia and the Muslims. 
This is therefore also in a sense a matter of drawing borders 
between the worlds and civilizations which have existed here on 
this soil since the break-up of the Roman empire, including the 
well-known Yalta agreement, and so forth. 
  Consequently, this is a matter of decisive and fateful 
solutions which will reverberate, not only reverberate but they 
will also have a decisive influence on the future development of 
relations in southeast Europe and, consequently, in the world 
too. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, how do you comment on the 
fact that Mr. Alija Izetbegovic has so yet made no direct 
comment on the Washington agreement? In the latest issue of 
LJILJAN [Bosnian Muslim newspaper] we could read Alija 
Izetbegovic's seven theses which show that he has not given up 
on the concept of a unitary civic state. 
  [Tudjman] I think that Mr. Izetbegovic had to agree with Mr. 
Silajdzic before Silajdzic put his signature on the Washington 
agreement. The fact that he has so far not spoken in public 
could perhaps be explained by Mr. Izetbegovic not being as quick 
as he usually was, which resulted in his search for a solution 
occasionally showing inconsistencies or attempts to pass the 
blame for the clashes between Muslims and Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on Croatia. 
  Someone has drawn my attention to his recent statement on 
fascism from the left and right, and it is obviously not clear 
what he referred to. 
  However, I think that it is important that Mr. Izetbegovic 
had to give his approval to the Washington agreement, and that 
in the talks we have held, Mr. Izetbegovic agreed that there is 
a need for coexistence of Croats and Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have also signed public and -- I can say 
this today -- secret agreements on a confederal solution such as 
this one. However, after that he also signed other agreements, 
for example the famous agreement with the Serbs in which he 
accepted the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina because the 
agreement specified that in the event of the division, that is, 
if Serbia [as heard] opted out, the rights of an international 
entity -- that is the right to UN membership -- would pass on to 
the Muslim republic. 
  Anyhow, all these events took place in the very complex 
circumstances of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. In my opinion, 
it is important today that we have this solution which Mr. 
Silajdzic already signed, and which I believe to have Mr. 
Izetbegovic's approval. 
  [Correspondent] [name indistinct], VJESNIK editor. Mr. 
President, will a referendum be held in Croatia on the 
confederal relationship or a federation between Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? And is there a possibility that this 
confederation might also be joined by the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia [FRY]? Thank you. 
  [Tudjman, laughing] A referendum will certainly be held 
because this is envisaged in the Croatian Constitution. But 
where you got the idea that this confederation will be joined by 
Yugoslavia -- this I really do not know. I do not think there 
will be such a referendum in Croatia. Allow me -- as I said in 
my message -- we are continuing to adhere to the policy of the 
need and necessity for the normalization of relations between 
Croatia and Serbia and Yugoslavia. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, if I can ask a question. 
Something which is not looking as far into the future as my 
colleague (Sejakovic) suggested: What would happen -- would 
there be a confederation of the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
with Croatia or the Republic of Croatia? To what extent would 
the Bosnian Serbs agree to a federative or rather a cantonal 
system in Bosnia? As far as I know Mr. Redman has just come up 
with this idea in Belgrade today. I have another question which 
is more important -- perhaps you could answer this first. You 
probably already know the vague outlines of the future 
super-counties or cantons in Bosnia. What will happen with the 
canton or what will happen to the Croatian part of Bosnian 
Posavina? Is there a possibility that this might cut through 
the Serb corridor with the western part of Bosnia? Thank you. 
  [Tudjman] What might happen and what will happen if the 
current so-called Serb Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina agrees to 
remain in a federal or confederal relationship with 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- I would not like to speculate on this. It 
is difficult to imagine something like this. It also seems to 
me that this proposal and initiative by the main international 
factors starts from the fact that there will not be such a 
thing. However, in any event responsible people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina must consider this but, of course, from a 
Croatian point of view this represents a new element which we 
will consider with full responsibility and bearing in mind the 
interests of the Croatian people as a whole and the Croatian 
state. 
  Understandably, Posavina, the territory of Bosnian Posavina 
was -- as everyone knows -- purely Croatian in historic terms. 
It was envisaged as a Croat canton. This issue will be solved 
as a whole in the organization of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
federation, that is between the Muslims and the Croats and even 
the Serbs. As you said yourself, I believe that the emphasis, 
that the efforts will now be focused on persuading the Serbs -- 
something that is indicated by Mr. Redman's visit to Belgrade -- 
to accept a solution that would be acceptable to the other two 
peoples. 
  [Redzep] Diana Redzep, Deutsche Welle. Mr. President, the 
Serbian press, citing Mr. Simic's statements, are heralding 
Slobodan Milosevic's visit to Zagreb in the near future or, 
alternatively, your visit to Belgrade. Are you getting ready 
for such a visit -- which inevitably leads to the question: Why 
is Croatia sending its official representative to Belgrade at a 
time when foreign diplomats have left it, and what is the 
country he has been sent to? Thank you. 
  [Tudjman] As far as foreign diplomats are concerned, as far 
as I know they are just coming back to Belgrade. They left 
Belgrade at the moment when it was being debated whether the 
ultimatum and air strikes would incite large-scale flames of 
war, so they would be threatened. As far as I know, they are 
coming back. 
  Croatia is sending its representative, it is opening its 
office in Belgrade in order to bring about the normalization of 
relations, a normalization of relations that is not only in the 
interest of the Croatian people, so we can integrate as soon as 
possible the Croatian territories under the protection of the 
peace forces without warfare, but also because the normalization 
of relations between Croatia and Serbia is also a precondition 
for the creation of the new world order in the area of the 
former Yugoslavia in this part of southeast Europe. 
  Consequently, this was and still is our policy. But this is 
also the policy of the responsible world factors, Europe and 
even the United States, as you can see even in the fact that 
President Clinton's envoy is also visiting Belgrade. 
Consequently, it is impossible to rule out negotiations with 
Belgrade. We welcome the fact that the international community, 
headed by the United States, has at last realized that more 
decisive steps should be taken if these negotiations fail, if 
there is no success. 
  [Correspsondent] HRVATSKI VJESNIK, Vinkovci. Mr. President, 
the result of your continuous policy of cooperation and 
friendship with Croats of Islamic faith, or Bosniak-Muslims will 
be the signing of the federal and confederal agreements. I 
would like to know whether you will accept and whether you can 
accept Mr. Izetbegovic's view that the Serbs in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are the occupying force and that they are not 
a constituent people any more, but a national minority, which 
has been confirmed on Croatian Television by Bosnia- 
Herzegovina's ambassador to Croatia. 
  [Tudjman] I will first refer to the previous question and 
then I will return to yours. I have not heard so far that we 
had already announced my trip to Belgrade or Milosevic's arrival 
in Zagreb. In any case that has not been discussed and that 
cannot happen before our relations are normalized, until Croatia 
is diplomatically recognized in its borders. I would welcome 
such a meeting, but only provided that we have first achieved a 
peaceful solution, reintegrated Croatian territories into the 
constitutional and legal system of Croatia, and provided 
Belgrade has given up the occupation of these territories. 
Belgrade is still involved in the occupation of Croatian 
territories through providing weapons and through including Knin 
and so-called Krajina in its monetary system etc. When our 
relations are normalized in such a way I will accept such a 
meeting. As I have once said: For the sake of peace and in 
order to stop the bloodshed of Croat people, to enable Croats to 
live normal lives, I am willing to go even to hell and back. I 
have said this once before and I stick to it. 
  And now your question. It is clear that the Serbs were 
aggressors, first through the Yugo-communist army, and then 
through Serbia's expansionist policy, in their attempts to 
create Greater Serbia. They first occupied a third of Croatia's 
territory, or rather that third of the territory that remained 
in their hands -- they had, with the Yugoslav army, held the 
whole of Croatia. They were holding one third, and then we 
liberated a part of it -- there is still a quarter of our 
territory under the protection of the peace-keeping forces, or 
under Serb occupation. 
  It is also a fact that they are holding two thirds of 
Bosnia- 
Herzegovina under their authority, and -- clearly, it can be 
said -- under their occupation. But it is also a fact that the 
Serbs are one of the three constituent peoples there and that 
the international community accepts this fact and has negotiated 
with representatives of the Bosnian Serbs so far, as well as 
with Belgrade. In conducting our policy we have to take this 
reality into consideration, and we have to adjust our policy to 
the real state of affairs and to the facts of international 
politics. 
  [Paradzic] Zeljko Paradzic, GLAS SLAVONIJE. Mr. President, 
can you comment on statements by Assembly Deputy Speaker, Mr. 
Djukic, that the Serbs will never accede to being a national 
minority in Croatia; also, which guarantee is the world 
community offering to ensure that the occupied Croatian areas -- 
that Belgrade will give them up? Thank you. 
  [Tudjman] The position of Serbs in Croatia is set out in the 
Croatian constitution and in a special constitutional law which 
we adopted in agreement with the EC arbitration commission and 
the European conference on the former Yugoslavia, so statements 
by individuals along these lines cannot change anything. 
  Your other question -- on guarantees. The statements by the 
most responsible world factors, the heads of almost all main 
states, not only foreign ministers but also state statesmen, and 
the most important European states and the United States [words 
indistinct]. However, the guarantee of the world organization 
of the United Nations -- which in all its resolutions, 
especially resolution 871, confirms and guarantees the 
territorial integrity of independent Croatia -- is more 
important. 
  In these circumstances Croatia has demonstrated that it is 
an 
effective factor in precisely these international attempts to 
resolve all sober questions in the modern world in a peaceful 
way and in not allowing individual national minorities to cause 
the destruction of sovereign states and the provocation of 
general war chaos. 
  In these circumstances when Croatia has on its side both the 
EU and the main world great power of the United Nations, when 
our agreement is also being welcomed by the Islamic countries, 
in these circumstances we can really be sure that we will have 
the support of all these international factors and that we will 
realize the incorporation of these Croatian territories under UN 
protection into the constitutional and legal system of Croatia 
in a peaceful way. If this is not successful, then we would have 
the political support for those steps which we would have to 
take -- and it is in this that the success of Croatian state 
policy and the far-reaching nature of the agreement which we 
have signed is reflected. 
  [Skugor] Milana Skugor, HINA. Mr. President, how far has the 
process of dividing [former] Yugoslavia's assets gone, and can 
we see what Croatia will get? My second question is about 
preparations for the tourist season. What is the Croatian 
government doing to bring back tourists who used to come before 
the war? 
  [Tudjman] Okay, please, can you ask just one question at a 
time from now on? I cannot remember two. 
  Tourism. The Croatian Government is already taking steps. 
You could have read that there have been echoes of this 
[Washington] agreement at the Berlin tourist congress, whatever 
that gathering is called. It is certain that the agreement in 
itself, and especially its implementation, will have a 
considerable impact not only on the revival but also on the 
development of tourism in Croatia at a level higher than before. 
  Your first question referred to the succession. 
  Concerning the Croatian delegation and the delegations of 
the 
other countries -- from Slovenia to Macedonia -- they have made 
quite a good progress in solving all those problems with the 
help of the EU negotiators taking part in negotiations on the 
division of assets. However, the Serb -- that is Yugoslav -- 
delegation obstructed the negotiations and prevented them from 
reaching an agreement. 
  This step in the search for peace, in forcing all those -- 
and primarily Belgrade -- who are in one way or another involved 
in the overall crisis, and consequently in the problem of the 
succession will be forced to solve that problem [as heard]. 
Both we and the world understand that the solving of the 
problem of the succession -- as well as the occupation of the 
Croatian areas -- cannot be postponed for a long time, because 
that means that Belgrade has the assets which belonged to the 
former Yugoslavia. That problem needs to be put on the agenda 
to be solved as soon as possible. 
  Besides, in connection with this, there is a question of a 
practical nature. The UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is now placing part of the heavy weaponry 
under its control. It would probably be very useful if those 
weapons did not come again -- for any purpose -- into the hands 
of the aggressor and the Serbian army, the Serbian side in whose 
possession they have been until now, but were instead destroyed 
or put at the disposal of the others. Personally, I prefer the 
destruction and a financial deal to solve that part of the 
succession, which to a large extent involves weaponry. 
  [Ggorgyi] Orban Gyorgyi, Hungarian Radio. Mr. President, 
is there a certain fear that a confederal resolution of state 
relations between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia 
could serve the Serbs in the so-called Krajina in their demand 
for a confederation with Serbia, and unfortunately also 
statements by Mr. Churkin indicate the complexity of possible 
parallels [as heard]. What do you think about this? 
  [Tudjman] First of all, one cannot compare the problem of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina - the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina -- with the Serbs in Croatia. The Serbs, Croats, 
and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina are three constituent peoples 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, whereas the Serbs in Croatia -- the 
ethnic Serb community -- are a minority in Croatia. Their 
position is set out in the Croatian constitution and 
constitutional law. So they do not have any right to 
self-determination; and it is clearly stated in international 
conventions that minorities do not have the right to 
self-determination, and this is the case in practice in the 
world as well, because if this were recognized, if the right of 
all minorities to self-determination and separation were 
recognized, no international order would be possible and general 
chaos and general war would ensue. 
  [Ramljak] Olga Ramljak, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. Will we have a 
referendum on establishing of confederal relations with the 
Bosnia- Herzegovina federation before the Bosnian Serbs decide 
where they want to be -- whether they will remain in the Bosnian 
federation or join Yugoslavia? And which part of Bosnia can the 
Bosnian Serbs take out with them, and what consequences does 
this have, bearing in mind that Croatia has a narrow coastal 
strip? 
  [Tudjman] We certainly will not hold a referendum until the 
Serb question in Bosnia-Herzegovina is resolved, for the final 
confederal agreement cannot be reached until that issue is 
clear. As you know, the Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina at their 
meeting in Mostar yesterday and before that put forward a 
justified demand -- that they can agree to a confederation 
within Bosnia-Herzegovina only if a confederation with Croatia 
is subsequently to be founded. 
  I believe this demand is justified, although the draft 
constitution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation also 
guarantees complete equality to the Croats and full sovereignty 
on the territories where they are the majority population. The 
cantons are envisaged to have their own constitutions, their 
legislative authorities, their own budget, police, president. 
It is also envisaged that the cantons where Croats are in the 
majority should form a Croat council for coordination of the 
Croat policy in federal organs. Full equality is guaranteed to 
the Croats within the federal organs of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It 
is envisaged that the president and vice president of the 
federation are elected every four years, that one is a Croat and 
the other is a Muslim, and that the president's nationality 
changes every four years. Full equality is also guaranteed in 
the government. At least one-third of ministers have to be of 
Croat nationality, although the Croat population in the 
federation is not as large. The prime minister, deputy prime 
minister, and ministers also have deputies, one is Croat, the 
other Muslim. Therefore, full equality and participation is 
guaranteed to the Croats in the whole of the state 
administration of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. 
  The important issues, if they may be in the government, 
because the government will reflect the composition of the 
population, but perhaps if the government includes a larger 
number of ministers of other nationalities, the Muslim 
nationality or others that would remain in the Bosnian 
federation, decisions on the important issues can only be taken 
by a consensus [sentence as heard]. Therefore, nothing can be 
imposed on the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina that would 
contravene their interests. 
  This is envisaged both as regards the president and the vice 
president of the federation, as regards both chambers of the 
parliament, the government, judiciary, the state prosecutor and 
so on. Therefore, with this solution the Croats are gaining not 
only what they now have in their hands, what they have managed 
to defend from the Serb aggression, and managed to preserve in 
this conflict with the Muslims, but also all the Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are gaining an opportunity to secure not only 
their national survival, but also an opportunity to be involved 
in the state administration throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, which 
is then particularly included that, the confederal alliance with 
Croatia is also creating favorable conditions [as heard]. 
  Of course, this does not mean that the Muslims are thus 
being 
put in an inferior position. Full equality is being secured 
between the Bosniak-Muslim and the Croat nations regarding their 
equality in interests in the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and 
in the confederation with Croatia, which is also in the 
interest, as I said in my address to the nation, which is in the 
interest of the Western democratic world. To exclude 
nationalist or extremist fundamentalist elements and to 
streamline this federation of Bosnia- Herzegovina toward the 
Western world, the Western democracy in the sense of eternal 
(?watersheds) in this part of Europe by relying on Croatia and 
through the cooperation between the Croat and the Bosniak-Muslim 
nations [sentence as heard]. 
  [Correspondent] I asked [words indistinct] will go to 
Yugoslavia? 
  [Tudjman] This remains to be seen. Anyway, our interests are 
one thing and Serbia's interests are another. Still, I believe 
it is evident that in this case we have reached a stage where 
agreement has been reached between Croatian views and the views 
of major European states and even the United States as the 
world's main superpower. Once we have reached this stage we can 
say that the issue is not just our issue but that of those main 
world powerlines and factors and that it will be examined from 
this point of view too. 
  On my part I have suggested, as I put forward proposals in 
the past, I have now again put forward some proposals which are 
regarded from precisely this world and strategic point of view 
as very interesting and which will be considered by these 
factors who are being preoccupied with resolving the crisis and 
who will take final decisions. 
  [al-Isa] Nada al-Isa, Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and TV. I 
would like to ask you to comment on the increasingly frequent 
rumors, at least that is what you can read in the Croatian 
press, originating in Herzegovina, Herceg-Bosna, according to 
which the message is as follows: We are not going to stay in 
any kind of Bosnia-Herzegovina union, whatever its name, unless 
the Serbs are there too, that is in the event of the Serbs 
joining the so-called Yugoslavia. Your comment, please. 
  [Tudjman] I believe that these views were in evidence when 
the talk was of a union of three republics. At yesterday's 
meeting the presidential council of Herceg-Bosna and the 
political leadership of Herceg-Bosna generally welcomed this 
preliminary Washington agreement. Their only condition 
stipulates that a Bosnia-Herzegovina federation is in a 
confederation with Croatia. Consequently, this is my answer to 
your question. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] the Serbs were the first 
to violate the cease-fire again yesterday when they shelled 
Gospic. What is your comment on this? 
  [Tudjman] You have already seen -- especially in that air 
attack by Serb planes on the factories in Bugojno and Novi 
Travnik and also in some provocations on Croatian soil -- that 
in the Serb ranks there are those who oppose a peaceful solution 
and who particularly want to provoke a renewal of the war in 
Croatia in order to draw attention away from the problem of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the face of the resolve of the 
international community to find a solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina 
before going for the decisive incorporation of Croatian 
territory under control of the peacekeeping forces in Croatia, 
they wanted to thwart this or rather provoke war, and the 
renewal of the war. 
  Such things will happen and it is to be expected on the Serb 
side too -- both in the protected areas and especially in 
Belgrade -- that reason will prevail and that we will reach a 
general solution precisely with what we have achieved. 
  [Nareshkin] Nareshkin, ITAR-TASS. Mr. President, what can be 
expected from Mr. Granic's visit to Moscow on 9 March? Thank 
you. 
  [Tudjman] Well, the invitation sent by Minister Kozyrev to 
our foreign minister indicates that the government of Russia has 
hitherto tried to act constructively and has acted 
constructively to resolve the crisis on the territory of the 
former Yugoslavia and, regardless of the fact that many consider 
that it has one-sidedly placed itself on the side of Serbia, we 
can say with our experience that the government of the Russian 
Federation has come out in favor of the territorial integrity of 
Croatia and that it has proposed to Belgrade that it recognize 
Croatia and establish diplomatic relations on this basis. 
  Mr. Churkin -- during his stay here in Croatia and in his 
talks with the Serbs in Knin -- also proposed that they begin to 
have talks to find a peaceful solution to the Serb question in 
Croatia. So we see the invitation to our foreign minister, 
Granic, to visit Moscow as the continuation of Russia's positive 
policy, i.e. Russia is not one-sidedly on the side of Serbia or 
what it has achieved through its aggression, but Russia wants to 
have a positive influence in the sense that, in agreement both 
with the EU and the United States, Russia will also play a 
positive role in finding a lasting solution. 
  [Modric] Franja Modric, NOVI LIST. Please, Mr. President, to 
what extent would this powerful international community led by 
the United States succeed in forcing the Bosnian Serbs into a 
Bosnian federation? Would you say in this case that Croatia 
should enter a confederation with such a Bosnia-Herzegovina or 
not? In other words, if you were to support entry at that time 
what would Croatia's interest be in joining a confederal union? 
  [Tudjman] I said that we would consider this question if and 
when this might happen. In any event, it is one kind of 
confederation if there is to be only a federation of Croats with 
Bosniak Muslims, and it is another kind of confederation if it 
is also to include Serbs. I do not rule out that Croatia could 
have an interest in this if this were to happen, but of course, 
as I said, this would be in a different kind of confederation. 
  In any event it is in Croatia's interest that conditions are 
created to prevent a Serb expansionist policy aimed at creating 
a Greater Serbia and conquering even Croatian territory -- and 
this kind of Serb expansionist policy -- and to this end we have 
strong guarantees not only for the organization of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina but also from the international community. 
  [Kuzmanovic] Jasmina Kuzmanovic, AP. Mr. President, if the 
decision on a confederation with the Bosnian republic is 
implemented.... 
  [Tudjman, interrupting] I do not understand, if? 
  [Kuzmanovic] Mr. President, if the confederation begins 
truly 
to function in real life, is there a possibility that the 
Bosniaks and Croats together might recover some territories in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? For example, they could set out to regain 
the north, the corridor where the Bosnian Serbs seem to have 
been rather nervous over the past few days and are launching a 
counteroffensive in the area. Thank you. 
  [Tudjman] The agreement which we signed, toward which we are 
aspiring, is not an agreement to continue the war, but to end 
the war. We believe that the international community -- as it 
is oriented today, including major European states and the 
United States -- must play the main role in solving the issues 
of borders in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Tudjen] Branko Tudjen, VECERNJI LIST. My question will not 
have such political overtones, something that is a little 
unusual. For the second time I am recalling the fact that I was 
a sports reporter for a number of years. There are a great deal 
of sports problems which in my view are not negligible. This 
one is about football, about coaches, selectors, Markovic, 
Blazevic, Ivic, and so forth. The newspapers are full of that. 
I am saying this as the editor of a newspaper which finds this 
issue very important. Your name is being plugged in a way into 
this issue among the public -- as if you are taking part in 
this, you have decided in favor of one person or another. This 
whole crisis is being linked to you, too. I would like you to 
comment on this? 
  [Tudjman] Yes, there is no such evil. Sometimes it is good 
that it is ascribed to me. I am interested in having Croatian 
sports based on sound foundations. As far as the national team 
is concerned, it is a fact that today we have a number of 
European and world-class footballers in the world. This means 
that the Croatian national team could be an ambassador of this 
new democratic Croatia just as Ivanisevic and athletes in other 
fields are. Internal competitions in Croatia are organized in 
line with Croatian potentials. In this way Croatian clubs could 
represent Croatia in Europe on a long-term basis and be present 
as representatives of a people who have won their international 
recognition, something to which athletes can contribute in all 
areas. 
  At the same time machinations and swindles are being 
prevented from taking place as well as, above all, unsupervised 
spending in professional sport, and to a degree Croatia, as it 
is, cannot bear [as heard]. This is how much I am interested in 
my capacity as president of state. Not to mention that I know 
the importance of sport, that I like sport very much and that I 
know the importance of sport for the health of the young and 
even the entire people. 
  I have no connection with individual cases, whether this or 
that person will be. I do not want to take part in this.

  [Text] At a session last night of the Social Democratic 
Party [Socijal Demokratska Partija -- SDP] executive, a protocol 
on unification of the Social-Democratic Party of Croatia and the 
Social-Democratic Party of Croatia [Socijal Demokratska Stranka 
Hrvatske -- SDH] was signed by SDP President Ivica Racan and SDH 
president Antun Vujic, the SDP announced today. 
  Departing from their identical programs and commitments and 
closely related political views, the SDP and the SDH maintain 
that their unification is in the interest of both parties and 
particularly the left-wing of social-democratic orientation, its 
[SDP] statement says. Both parties regard this move as the 
first and necessary step toward a broader association of 
Croatia's left-wing democratic forces, it is stated in the 
protocol agreed by the presidents of the two parties. It will 
go in effect once it has been endorsed by the relevant bodies of 
both parties. 
  The united party is the political and legal successor of the 
SDP and SDH. Its official name is the Social-Democratic Party 
of Croatia [Socijal-Demokratska Partija Hrvatske]. According to 
the protocol, the post of president will be performed by Ivica 
Racan. Antun Vujic will act as president of the council. This 
change at the helm of the SDP council was carried out in 
agreement with, and with the support of, the present president 
of the council, Zdravko Tomac. The party's top bodies will 
include members of the hitherto top leaderships of both parties. 
A unification congress, or a convention, is expected to take 
place by the end of April, the statement says.

<F P=106> [Report by Danko Peric] </F>
  [Text] For the third day in a row, the majority of entries 
in the bulletin of the Serbian Krajina army press center refers 
to the activities of Krajina fighters in expelling Croatian 
combatants who had attacked a section of the region of 
Teslingrad in Lika. This morning, the report that the Cupovac 
region has been regained was confirmed. Yesterday's report said 
that what is in fact involved is the area between Jurkovic and 
(Bartic) Poljana, which was briefly occupied by the Croatian 
combatants. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops should have 
control over it, as was precisely stated in the Vance plan. 
  The headquarters of the Serbian Krajina army has announced 
the liberation of the (?facility) of (Trlo), also on the 
Teslingrad front. In the battles, Krajina fighters suffered no 
losses, but Croatian losses are claimed to be great. It is 
interesting to note that Croatian radio does not report on these 
battles, but has even carried reports that it is allegedly calm 
on the Gospic front. 
  According to the press center of the Serbian Krajina army 
headquarters, there have also been some Croatian Army 
provocations on the (Plascan) section of the Lika front, and 
attacks on Kricko and Zitnic near Drnis, as well as Otesic in 
the Vrlika region. These provocations by the Croatian Army drew 
a response.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish Sejm Marshal Jozef Oleksy by Marta </F>
Stolarova and Jan Zizka in Prague on 1 March: The Polish 
Coalition Is Not Threatened by a Collapse"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] During 
the talks with Prime Minister Klaus, you mentioned that the West 
could learn a lot in Poland and the Czech Republic. Could you 
be more specific? 
  [Oleksy] It sounds rather conceited, but we can say that 
Poland and the Czech Republic should not only take from Europe; 
they also have something to give. There is the potential 
ability to develop, for instance. The Western countries are 
facing recession, unemployment, and overproduction. I partially 
subscribe to the thesis that dynamic development is not to be 
expected in the West but, rather, in Central and East Europe. 
It is also a question of a certain orthodoxy, which is quite 
pronounced in our countries because the transformation requires 
it. This can be linked to the transparency of our politics and 
its suitable interpretation. We can also prove how strong the 
bond is between social intentions and the pragmatic 
decisionmaking in the economy. Finally, there is also the 
phenomenal experience with the system of real socialism. This 
experience is not only bad but also good, in the sense that we 
know how it should not look. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Would you care to comment on the 
proposed solution of the Polish debt to the former Czech and 
Slovak Federal Republic? 
  [Oleksy] It is a debt of $85 million, of which $65 million 
is the share of the Czech Republic. Prime Minister Klaus gave 
his support to the concept that these funds will be used on the 
basis of a jointly drafted plan for the development of the 
infrastructure and ecology in those regions of the Czech 
Republic that border Poland. I consider that very reasonable. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] The Polish ambassador to Prague 
comments very favorably on the "economization of Czech foreign 
policy." What do you think? 
  [Oleksy] It could be referred to by another term, too--the 
subordination of foreign policy to economic goals and 
interests--and that is something I have been trying for in 
Poland for a long time. I believe that, after 1989, there was a 
period in Polish foreign policy when it was necessary to 
concentrate on building a new "contractual infrastructure." We 
have succeeded in this task. Today Poland needs politics to 
serve, above all, economic interests. Every country--and it 
applies even more to the small ones--must be able to calculate 
its economic interests and advocate them in the framework of the 
worldwide economic game. [passage omitted] 
  [Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech on 2 March on pages 1 
and 
12, in a similar interview, adds: 
  (Petr Janyska, LIDOVE NOVINY) How do you perceive the Czech 
left wing, and what contacts do you have with it? 
  (Oleksy) Negligible--we meet with the social democrats only 
at international actions. We have not had any contacts with 
your communists for a long time. However, we do have very close 
contacts with Peter Weiss's party in Slovakia.]

<F P=106> [Interview with O. Vychodil (ODS), head of the parliamentary </F>
mission to the North Atlantic Assembly, by Nada Adamickova; 
place and date not given: "The World Does Not Perceive the 
Controversial Statements by Our Representative All That 
Dramatically"] 
  [Text] [Adamickova] Do you agree that, in foreign policy 
and related matters, party interests should not dominate? 
  [Vychodil] I agree absolutely. As a matter of fact, if the 
party interests dominated somewhere, which is not the case, I 
would consider it fatal for our foreign policy. 
  [Adamickova] So, you do not consider the big ado regarding 
Foreign Committee Chairman J. Payne, when even the Civic 
Democratic Party [ODS] itself had significant objections to his 
statements but defended him on the outside because his "recall 
was demanded by the opposition," to be a promotion of party 
interests? 
  [Vychodil] I will take the liberty of answering this direct 
question diplomatically because what you are referring to is 
actually diplomacy. The matter in question is really a 
parliamentary experiment with a coexistence of fire and water, 
with the provision that the fire must not be extinguished and 
water must not be heated up very much. Hence, it is a certain 
type of art, which man must learn to command. He has to learn 
in what area and on what topic he is to comment. Regarding the 
statements by colleague Payne, then, I know his views because he 
is a friend and colleague of mine, one of the most diligent 
people in this Chamber. What has been published does not 
completely correspond to his opinions. 
  [Adamickova] Nevertheless, at the session of the Foreign 
Committee, at which Payne was explaining his trip and statements 
he made in the United States, a detailed recording was heard of 
the meeting with compatriots, including precisely the phrases 
that appeared in the Czech press. 
  [Vychodil] Unfortunately, I did not take part in this 
session because I was abroad. Therefore, I cannot comment. 
  [Adamickova] Would you not agree that the Foreign Committee 
chairman should be more careful with what he says because he 
could possibly damage the interests of the Republic abroad? 
  [Vychodil] The question is how the statements by our 
politicians are perceived in the world--namely, I do not believe 
that statements made by the representatives of our parliament 
are perceived as neuralgically as we imagine. That is hardly 
the case. I believe that it is rather an internal affair. It is 
certain, however, that, given certain circumstances--i.e., if 
there were some hostile feelings against our Republic, it cannot 
be ruled out that the effect of some statements could be used 
against us. In this instance, however, it certainly did not 
happen. 
  [Adamickova] Do you believe it proper that your committee 
dealt with Payne's statements? 
  [Vychodil] I believe that the Foreign Committee is an 
autonomous body of the Chamber and can deal with whatever it 
sees appropriate. This right cannot be questioned. As far as 
my personal opinion goes, I do not believe it good if it deals 
with the statements of its chairman in his absence. 
  [Adamickova] The second time around, however, your committee 
dealt with the statements in the presence of its chairman, who 
declared that they should deal with foreign policy rather than 
matters of personnel.... 
  [Vychodil] I repeat again that the committee can deal with 
whatever it considers appropriate. It is simply a question of 
majority democracy. If the opposition holds a majority on the 
committee, it is a different matter entirely. 
  [Adamickova] How do you feel about our foreign policy 
suffering the malady of dearth of coordination? 
  [Vychodil] Of course, I am of the opinion that foreign 
policy should be coordinated and clear-cut. We have to realize 
one thing, however: Disparate statements by different 
representatives of the same state are nothing unusual. That is 
again overestimating something on our part. Let us take a 
specific example of the North Atlantic Alliance ultimatum to 
Bosnia, for instance. It is possible that, in statements for 
the press, various sides of the same problem are emphasized. 
One more, one less. Thus, it depends on what is more important 
from the point of view of that representative. Personally, I do 
not see it as a tragedy, and it is not perceived dramatically in 
the world. On the other hand, I must say frankly that our 
Republic is judged from a different perspective. What is only 
recorded in the instance of traditionally democratic countries 
is occasionally dramatized in our instance. Fortunately, this 
trend exists only here. 
  [Adamickova] Excuse me, but I cannot agree with you 
regarding the specific example of the Bosnia ultimatum when you 
speak about the unequal emphasis. The difference between the 
statements by the president and the prime minister certainly was 
not one of emphasis but of a completely different stance. 
  [Vychodil] Allow me to polemicize. We have here the 
resolution adopted by the Foreign Committee on the situation in 
Bosnia. When you read it, you will find that both 
aforementioned views fit in there, and it really is just a 
matter of emphasis. It is one thing if we emphasize the force 
of the ultimatum, and another the bombing itself. We know that 
it is a dangerous thing, and the consequences can hardly be 
imagined. 
  [Adamickova] How do you, as the head of our parliamentary 
mission to the North Atlantic Assembly, view this problem? 
  [Vychodil] I do not believe that the conflict in Bosnia was 
brought there from without but, rather, that it is a problem 
that was dormant there. It is a very complex issue, where the 
Catholic civilization meets with the orthodox and the Muslim 
ones. The entire local history is very complex, and I see it as 
a conflict of cultures. I believe that the conflict cannot be 
solved in simple terms, and, to be frank, I do not know a 
responsible person who could imagine such a solution. I am 
convinced that the conflict cannot be solved from without. In 
any instance of a simplification, it may result in a threat to 
the security of not only that region but also the entire Balkans 
and, by extension, Europe. And we are only a six-hour drive 
from there. We must realize this and be very careful with 
various strong and unqualified statements. 
  [Adamickova] Do you believe that, if I accept your theory of 
different emphases, Czech interests could not have been damaged? 
  [Vychodil] It certainly was recorded, but just as certainly 
it will not damage our interests. 
  [Adamickova] Several days ago, your committee dealt with the 
preparations of a trip to Germany. This occurred after the 
parliamentary delegation began its visit to the German 
Parliament last December in a rather awkward way. Do you not 
believe it late to prepare a trip at the time when a faux pas 
takes place? 
  [Vychodil] I believe that preparations for a trip should be 
a matter of fact. Nevertheless--and do not take this as an 
excuse but, rather, as a statement of fact--we learn certain 
things by the hit-and-miss method. The misses are sometimes 
painful; at other times they are not. 
  [Adamickova] In a RUDE PRAVO interview, former Foreign 
Minister Dienstbier criticized some of our politicians for their 
opinion that what is happening east of us should not be at the 
center of our attention. Do you agree? 
  [Vychodil] I am deeply convinced that what is happening east 
of us must be at the center of our attention rather than not. 
Not to care about it could be fatal. I insist on this, 
regardless of what the politicians Dienstbier mentioned are like. 
  [Adamickova] At the same time, Dienstbier said that we had 
the opportunity to become the country we claim to be on the 
occasion of Bill Clinton's visit, but we did not use it. What 
is your opinion? 
  [Vychodil] Our country gained respect by the U.S. 
President's choice of it as the place to go. That speaks for 
itself. Regarding the respect per se, it is necessary to follow 
foreign press and statements by foreign politicians, who tend to 
agree that the Czech Republic is the best off of all of the 
postcommunist countries. That, I believe, is the best evidence. 
Moreover, I cannot imagine how we could prove this respect. By 
a one-time act or a declaration? After all, the world is not 
moved by opinions but, rather, by people and their cooperation, 
if I am to phrase it in a somewhat elevated manner. 
  [Adamickova] Do you agree that the belief that if someone is 
admitted to NATO, it would be the Czech Republic first, and no 
one will joint the Alliance without it is exaggerated? I am 
referring to Payne's statements made in the United States. 
  [Vychodil] I am not talking about entry into NATO but, 
rather, an integration of world security structures. If 
countries are to join, they must know everything it involves. 
That is not just having a protecting umbrella. It also means a 
certain economic burden and, especially, a certain way of 
assuming responsibility. In other words, if countries want to 
join the Alliance, they must be democratic and economically 
stable, and membership can be built on that. I emphasize again 
that it is not some act or declaration but a process. 
  [Adamickova] You have not answered my question.... 
  [Vychodil] I tried to answer it fully. Regarding your 
question, it is possible that we will be first to join NATO. It 
is also possible that it will be someone else. I would applaud 
him and certainly not envy him.

  [Text] The Czech foreign intelligence service--that is, the 
Office for Foreign Relations and Information--does not work 
against the interests of other countries and is not engaged in 
either political or economic espionage. Jan Subert, press 
spokesman of the Czech Ministry of the Interior, said this today 
in response to reports published in the Berlin-based newspaper 
DIE WELT, according to which the activities of espionage 
services of East European countries--above all, the Czech 
Republic--have increased of late. 
  According to Subert, the intelligence service gathers 
information about foreign activities that might endanger the 
security of the Czech Republic. In cooperation with partner 
intelligence services, it is oriented toward the areas of global 
risks against civilization--such as terrorism, drug trafficking, 
and the illegal transfer of arms.

  [Summary] According to officials of the National Property 
Fund, the overall receipts from the privatization of both 
small-size and large-size companies has amounted to 90.5 billion 
Czech korunas [Kc]. The revenues from the privatization of 
large-size companies in 1993 amounted to approximately Kc24.405 
billion. Since the Fund came into existence, this has amounted 
to approximately Kc50.937 billion. Overall receipts from the 
privatization of small-size companies amounted to Kc36.085 
billion. 
  Regarding privatization of large-size companies, foreign 
investors have invested more than Kc22 billion up to the 
present, which is almost 44 percent of the capital that has been 
invested overall. On 31 December 1993, more than Kc43 billion 
remained on the National Property Fund account after the 
deduction of all expenditures connected primarily with writing 
off the debts of the privatized companies. Out of this amount, 
Kc20 billion has been deposited with the Czech State Savings 
Bank. The interest from this long-term deposit will be used for 
the privatization of the health service. 
  There have also been problems with the repayment of money of 
the already privatized assets. At present, the Fund has taken 
to court a total of 93 subjects who have failed to repay money 
owed, which amounts to Kc2 billion. The court has so far 
resolved only five cases.

<F P=106> [Article by Robert Zelenka: "Jan Vlcek: The RDP Group Has </F>
Not Arranged Tank Deliveries"] 
  [Text] The reports about the possible export of modernized 
Russian-made T-72 tanks to Iran by the Czech RDP Group arms 
consortium are imprecise. This statement was made by RDP Group 
Director General Jan Vlcek at yesterday's news conference in 
Prague. He added that the "consortium rejects any suggestions 
that it would act at variance with the state's interests." 
  According to Director Vlcek, the RDP Group has not asked for 
permission to export modernized tanks or for a license to export 
equipment to Iran for repairing tanks; the company was merely 
"mapping out the market." The modernized tank, if it is 
exported, will not, according to him, be oriented toward regions 
engaged in conflict. The consortium will always consult the 
Foreign and Trade and Industry Ministries on the export of all 
military materials. 
  The fact that representatives from these ministries and the 
Defense Ministry have free access to each board meeting also 
contributes to the "transparency" of the company's commercial 
and manufacturing activity. The consortium has already 
concluded agreements abroad for certain orders, while others are 
being negotiated. Vlcek refused to specify them, however, in 
view of commercial confidentiality. The three-year stoppage has 
not benefited Czech arms exports on foreign markets, and many 
orders were canceled; nevertheless, the customers have remained 
aware of their quality. 
  The main objective of the RDP Group, however, is not exports 
but coordinating production activity, conducting research and 
development, securing new projects, financing them, and, last 
but not least, holding a dialogue with the Czech Army. 
  In this connection, the consortium's representatives 
criticized the Army's inadequate approach to its rearmament 
program, whose implementation has constantly been postponed. 
The RDP Group is trying to make sure that as many Czech 
enterprises as possible are involved in this state order. "We 
will produce whatever Czech industry can produce in the Czech 
Republic. Whatever it cannot produce will be guaranteed by 
linking up to a foreign partner," said Vlcek. If transferring 
production to the Czech Republic is unsuitable, the RDP Group 
will endeavor to agree upon countershipments at the same cost. 
  A number of projects, the criteria for which are price, high 
standards, and quality, have been prepared for the Czech Army. 
Modernizing the existing hardware will be one of the most 
comprehensive projects; new types of wheeled vehicles (including 
a licensed product from Avia Letnany, which is already being 
tested by the Interior Ministry) are also being prepared. Other 
projects involve hand weapons, including antitank missiles, the 
development of new ammunition, including intelligent ammunition, 
and communications systems. The projects should be put forward 
in the very near future. Cooperation with the Army, however, is 
not proceeding as the producers, who need to sell as much as 
possible in the shortest time possible, had hoped. 
  The Topfin banking hous, which is, in fact, a consortium of 
banks involving, for example, the Investicni banka and the 
Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka, is prepared to provide finance 
for the projects. The company also has links to banks in Paris 
and Washington and is organizing representation in Moscow.

<F P=106> [Article by "(gag)": "The Engineers' Ambitions and Plans </F>
Are in Contrast to the Army's Dilatoriness"] 
  [Text] Prague--The 40 companies affiliated in the RDP 
Group now account for 60 percent of arms production in the Czech 
Republic, said Jan Vlcek, the consortium's director general, to 
reporters. Coordinating production, pooling resources and 
capacities, and importing advanced technologies are not the 
consortium's only aims; it is also interested in offering to 
quickly and economically reaarm the Czech Army with equipment 
compatible with that of NATO. In reply to a question on how the 
RDP Group Board explains the inactive cooperation with the Army, 
the director general of LIAZ, Jablonec, said the following at 
yesterday's news conference: "We are still seeking our place in 
relation to the state institutions; apart from this, the Army is 
going through comprehensive transformation, which also involves 
conceptual changes in procuring equipment. There is a dialogue 
between us. Otherwise, it is impossible--armies throughout the 
world have an important position with regard to domestic 
industry. After all, it is financed from the state budget and 
from taxpayers' money." Modernizing weapons and logistics, new 
types of wheeled vehicles (from a jeep that is being tested by 
the Interior Ministry to heavy tractors), a modular system of 
hand weapons, antitank missiles, intelligent ammunition, and 
effective communications systems are among the RDP Group's key 
projects. 
  The RDP Group would like to discuss its projects with the 
Army in the next few days. The director general of Avia Praha, 
which will manufacture 200 special jeep-type all-terrain 
vehicles this year, said that the Army still does not have a 
rearmament program, which has a severe affect on the development 
and production capacity of the engineering enterprises. 
  "The concept for the Army's rearmament was made public in 
the 
middle of last year, with the proviso that it should be ready in 
January," added Director Vlcek. "However, it will not be 
submitted until the second half of the year, and then only in 
general form." According to Vlcek, this is a common problem 
between a businessman and a customer. Apparently, what is worse 
is that the RDP Group is losing out on a qualified expert in the 
Defense Ministry, with which it could be holding talks.

  [Excerpt] A whole system of submersible walls has had to be 
built against oil leakages at River Olse in the border area from 
Jablunkov in the direction of Bohumin. More from our reporter 
Frantisek Tvrz, who is in the affected area: 
  [Tvrz] At the moment, investigators and ecology inspectors 
are investigating how many tonnes of the crude oil product 
leaked from the fuel area of the Czech railways at Jablunkov 
yesterday. According to this morning's statement by the 
breakdown commission, the nonspecialist estimates suggest a 
leakage of approximately six to seven tonnes. 
  The whole system of submersible walls was built immediately 
below Jablunkov but also at the brook at Navsi and then lower 
down, toward the confluence of the Olse border river to the Odra 
River, via Trinec, Cesky Tesin up to Bohumin-Vernovice. [passage

  [Excerpts] [Announcer Lydia Mrazova] The parliamentary 
Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] held talks with the 
nonparliamentary Social Democratic Party of Slovakia [SDSS] this 
morning. [passage omitted] 
  At a news conference held at midday today, Peter Weiss and 
Jaroslav Volf, the chairmen of the two parties, reported on new 
elements in the relations between these two parties. Ludmila 
Bulakova returned from the news briefing only a few minutes ago. 
Good day to you. 
  [Bulakova] Good day. 
  [Mrazova] I presume that issues relating to parliamentary 
elections and the solution of internal political crisis topped 
the agenda, especially because, in the interview broadcast by 
Bratislava radio yesterday, SDL Chairman Peter Weiss did not 
rule out the possibility of forming a coalition with the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. What do the social 
democrats think of it? 
  [Bulakova] First of all, Jaroslav Volf said that forming a 
temporary government would be a risky business. Replying to the 
specific question as to what they would think if the SDL joined 
Vladimir Meciar's government, Volf said, and I quote, this move 
would not promote stabilization in Slovakia and would amount to 
a denial of the idea of the government of broad coalition. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Mrazova] According to Pavol Kanis [SDL deputy chairman], 
the 
SDL is prepared to discuss the date of early elections today. 
At the same time, it is not against any date because it wants 
the present situation to calm down. But, as is known, Jaroslav 
Volf thinks that the elections should be a tool through which 
political entities could acquire a definite shape. Because of 
this, he thinks that the June date is very questionable. Was 
this also discussed? 
  [Bulakova] As far as this disputed point is concerned, Mr. 
Volf said that it was tabled at the talks with the SDL. The two 
parties then discussed their positions and felt that a realistic 
date for elections is the end of September or the beginning of 
October. [passage omitted] 
  But, to wind it all up, the whole news conference and the 
pronouncements made there ended with a statement made by SDL 
Chairman Weiss, who said that the SDSS views would be taken into 
consideration in the PDL's talks with the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. The SDL described the SDSS as its 
strategic partner. 
  [Mrazova] Let us assume that the HZDS and the SDL will not 
reach an agreement today. Will the SDL initiate a dismissal of 
the government? 
  [Bulakova] Peter Weiss's answer to this was that the word 
"never" does not exist in politics. One has to consider all of 
the available options. One of the options is to form a 
reconstituted coalition government of experts. He did not rule 
out any of the options, however.

  [Excerpt] Representatives of the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak National Party [SNS] met today 
for their regular Monday talks. Their talks were likely to 
contain a new topic: the possibility that the Party of the 
Democratic Left [SDL] will join the coalition. 
  At a short press briefing, today's talks were described 
first 
by Vladimir Meciar and then by Jan Slota, chairman of the Slovak 
National Party. 
  [Begin recording] [Meciar] The coalition talks concentrated 
on finding support in parliament from other political parties 
and movements for passing important decisions, such as the date 
of the elections, what to do before the elections, and the 
stabilization of the government. Then we discussed which party 
we should consider. It is, however, still too early to say more. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] We have heard that you are to 
hold talks today with the SDL. Can you reveal the topic of your 
talks? 
  [Meciar] The talks with the SDL are to be held this evening. 
We have informed the SNS about the likely course of these talks 
and our position. It is, however, premature to reveal anything 
because this is to be the first official meeting of this nature. 
  [Correspondent] What does your coalition partner think about 
these talks? 
  [Slota] The SNS sees clearly that political stabilization 
has 
priority. This means it wishes for early parliamentary 
elections to be held as soon as possible. For this reason, it 
will support all of the HZDS's steps. 
  [Correspondent] Would the SNS agree with an election 
coalition between the HZDS and the SDL, knowing that the SDL 
presidium said that it would be willing to get together with the 
SNS but without its chairman? 
  [Slota] I do not know the exact words they used. I doubt 
that 
anybody would formulate it in this way because Slota is not 
everything. A party is a party and Slota is Slota. In my view, 
the Slovak part of the SDL is aware that, in particular with 
regard to the economy, it is necessary to hold the elections in 
June. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, have you discussed 
personnel issues, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? 
  [Meciar] We analyzed the situation arising from the 
nonacceptance of Mr. Prokes by the president. He can be deputy 
prime minister but not minister. This is slightly paradoxical. 
Personnel issues will also be discussed tomorrow. 
  [Correspondent, in Czech] Mr. Prime Minister, would you be 
willing to change the date of the elections should an agreement 
be reached on other issues--as an exchange for something else? 
  [Meciar] For God's sake, we cannot make this into a market 
place. Citizens have made a decision through a petition that 
calls for a referendum. This should be implemented within 90 
days from the date decided by the president--that is, by the end 
of June 1994 at the latest. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Slovak National Bank Governor Vladimir Masar and 
Marian Jusko, vice governor of the bank, returned from Japan 
today. The main aim of their trip was signing an agreement with 
the Exim Bank of Japan about the loan to the value of 
approximately $42 million. 
  The first installment of this loan will be transferred to 
Slovakia as early as 9 March. It will be used for the support 
of small-scale and medium businesses. The first repayment of 
the loan has been set for 15 February 1998. 
  Representatives of the National Bank of Slovakia also held 
talks with the Japanese bank about the possibility of support in 
financing large investment projects. They include, above all, 
development of railway and river transport, development of the 
Bratislava airport, and transportation of gas and oil. [passage

  [Text] President of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy at 1400 departed from Ljubljana airport on 
a regular flight by the Russian air carrier Aeroflot to Moscow. 
  Because the Slovene authorities did not allow him entry into 
the country, he spent the night at the airport, together with 
his three companions. He was visited by Yuri Girenko, charge 
d'affaires of the Russian Federation Embassy in Ljubljana. 
  The Slovene Foreign Ministry has reported that it did not 
allow entry to Zhirinovskiy because of violations of public law 
and order during his visit in Slovenia at the end of January. 
On that occasion the Foreign Ministry merely advised him to 
leave the territory of the Republic of Slovenia as soon as 
possible.

  [Text] Ljubljana, March 5 (TANJUG) -- Slovenian Defence 
Minister Janez Jansa accuses President Milan Kucan of running 
illegal para-intelligence services and spy groups, the 
LJUBLJANSKI DNEVNIK daily wrote on Saturday. 
  The accusation comes at a time when the activity of these 
services in this breakaway Yugoslav republic, which has recently 
been made public by Kucan, is being traced back to Jansa's 
ministry. 
  Commenting on Kucan's statement that para-intelligence 
services and spies are keeping under surveillance leading 
Slovenian state officials, prominent citizens and individual 
reporters and are prepared to liquidate them if necessary, Jansa 
told LJUBLJANSKI DNEVNIK that the president "probably has in 
mind the various detective agencies ruled" by members of the 
State Security Service from the Communist times, "most of whom 
he knows personally." The agents were officially subordinated 
to Kucan while he was Slovenia's communist leader, "and are 
today probably unofficially" subordinated to him, averred Jansa. 
  The defence minister for the first time mentioned that he 
has 
received "numerous threats of physical liquidation," but did not 
elaborate. 
  "Liquidation threats should be taken seriously, especially 
after the murder of Ivan Kramberger," killed in the finale of 
the 1992 presidential campaign, said Jansa. 
  The quarrel between Kucan and Jansa, who have traded 
accusations also in a scandal involving arms smuggling for the 
interests of Bosnian Moslems, has been joined by the leadership 
of the United List, the second most influential parliamentary 
party, which has announced its intention to demand the 
resignation or recall of Jansa in the ruling coalition next 
week, on the grounds that "he is unfit for this position of 
authority."

  [Text] Ljubljana, March 4 (TANJUG) -- Slovenia has a public 
debt of nearly four billion dollars, the Bank of Slovenia 
(central bank) has said, making it clear this is only an 
unofficial estimate. This figure does not include the sum owed 
to depositors in neighbouring Croatia by the former Zagreb-based 
branch of Ljubljanska Banka, which Croatia insists exceeds 600 
million dollars. 
  On Thursday, Slovenia gave its first intimation that it has 
no intention of beginning to pay off its debt to the Croatian 
depositors this year. 
  Political and banking circles in Ljubljana expect the delay 
in paying money back to the Croatian depositors to provoke fresh 
differences in the already strained relations between the 
neighbours. Difficulties in relations between the two former 
Yugoslav republics, which have violently seceded from 
Yugoslavia, have become apparent earlier this year. 
  Trouble first surfaced because of Slovenia's refusal to 
deliver electricity from the jointly-built Krsko nuclear power 
plant because of Croatia's tardiness with the payments. Another 
bone of contention has been the Slovenian-Croatian common border 
in Istra. Last week, Slovenian police seized a Croatian boat in 
the Bay of Piran, for allegedly poaching in Slovenian 
territorial waters.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, deputy prime </F>
minister and minister of justice, by Piotr Gabryel and Marek 
Krol; place and date not given: "A Country of Anarchists"] 
  [Excerpts] [WPROST] Is there such a thing as an SLD-PSL 
[Democratic Left Alliance-Polish Peasant Party] coalition? 
  [Cimoszewicz] Yes. If we are to survive in politics, we 
have to accept the coalition. But show me a government in 
recent years that did not have any internal conflicts. There is 
nothing unusual about the fact that, after several months in 
office, there is a need to reexamine various issues, which we do 
at meetings of the so-called directorate--in other words, an 
informal gathering of coalition representatives. We do not mind 
the fact that PSL and SLD politicians hold various views, 
including on the subject of forming a government and the kind of 
information policy it should pursue. 
  [WPROST] Can one describe this government as Pawlak's "own" 
government? 
  [Cimoszewicz] According to the Constitution, the prime 
minister has the power to reach the kind of decisions he has 
just reached in relation to the deputy prime minister [Pawlak 
fired him]. On the other hand, the present government is based 
on two parties and that determines its method of functioning. 
Unfortunately, the Constitution does not envisage such a thing 
as a Government Presidium. Providing the government leadership 
with prestige is quite another matter. 
  [WPROST] But an absence of detailed regulations make it 
easier to mollify coalition members and turn the entire 
coalition into an illusory body. 
  [Cimoszewicz] That depends on the way one interprets events. 
I think it is too soon to say that the coalition is illusory. 
Our coalition requires a consolidation of its structures. We 
want certain political provisions to be set in writing so that 
we might know who is responsible for what. Only if we prove 
incapable of creating proper mechanisms for the functioning of 
the coalition will there be a danger that the coalition is 
incapable of functioning efficiently. 
  [WPROST] A danger for whom? 
  [Cimoszewicz] If the coalition experienced problems with 
trying to survive, the SLD would be in a difficult situation 
because, on its own, it might not be able to act effectively and 
implement its preelection pledges. [passage omitted] 
  [WPROST] Is Poland a democratic country, as the Constitution 
says it is? 
  [Cimoszewicz] It is trying to become one. We will succeed 
in turning it into a democratic country, but the day that 
happens is a very long way off. This involves not so much 
legislation as social consciousness and the attitudes of 
politicians. The law is still regarded as a means to an end. 
Even in recent years, violations of the law have been excused 
on grounds of so-called necessity. The civic ombudsman says 
that, in 1993, there were more violations of civic rights than 
before. [passage omitted] 
  [WPROST] Do you agree that the establishment of a 
law-governed state will be very difficult without a new 
constitution? 
  [Cimoszewicz] Unfortunately, even the present parliament 
might have problems with it, and even if it satisfies the formal 
requirements. If Lech Walesa were to put into practice some of 
the things members of the Presidential Chancellery have been 
saying, he would be playing a destructive role. Nothing can 
justify using the Constitution for the purpose of pursuing a 
political contest. I would be happier if the government 
concentrated on social and economic policy this year because 
that is the main source of conflict. [passage omitted] 
  [WPROST] Either we have a law-governed country or one ruled 
by the fist of stronger groups who win privileges for themselves 
at society's expense. 
  [Cimoszewicz] I am very upset about what I would describe as 
an anarchistic, unimaginative approach toward the affairs of 
one's own country. We are observing increasing egoism among 
professional groups that are convinced that they have to reap 
maximum benefits for the state. Frequently, we encounter the 
snowball effect--one group stages a demonstration for the sake 
of some benefit or concession and another sees this 
demonstration and follows suit. At the same time, we as a 
society fail to see that actions like this are suicidal for the 
state. We should consider which is better--a disintegration of 
what little resources we have, or the creation of a chance for 
the future. 
  [WPROST] How about a few examples? 
  [Cimoszewicz] Several years ago, a law on compensation for 
Stalinist persecution was passed. The lawmakers assumed that 
all affected persons would behave honorably and not make undue 
demands on the state's finances. But this year alone, 1.5 
trillion zlotys has had to be allocated for compensation. It is 
the same with reprivatization. It costs trillions of zlotys 
just to restore property that was misappropriated in pursuance 
of the previous legislation. Every single claim involves 
material or legal interests. But the sum total of these 
interests is ruining the state.

  [Text] Professor of Economics Dariusz Rosati is the 
official candidate of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] to the 
post of deputy prime minister and finance minister. Journalists 
were informed about this decision by the Alliance's press 
spokesman, Zbigniew Siemiatkowski. 
  [Reporter] The SLD leadership and that of the Polish Peasant 
Party, at a joint session on Saturday, gave their support to the 
candidature of Prof. Rosati, Zbigniew Siemiatkowski said. The 
deciding factors were the qualifications of the candidate, his 
wide experience, and the fact that he is well known in 
international economic circles. 
  On Saturday afternoon, the Alliance leader, Aleksander 
Kwasniewski, sent a letter regarding this matter to Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak. The prime minister is in touch with 
our candidate, Siemiatkowski said. 
  Prof. Rosati has spent the past few days in Warsaw. He is at 
present in Geneva, where, for the past three years, he has been 
working as an expert for the United Nations at the European 
Economic Commission. 
  Prof. Rosati is to return to Warsaw at the end of the week, 
Zbigniew Siemiatkowski said. 
  Now a few words about the candidate: He is in his forties, 
is not a member of any party, and had been a member of the 
Polish United Workers Party until its dissolution. He comes 
from Radom. He is married, with two children, and has 
outstanding qualifications and abilities for these posts, 
Zbigniew Siemiatkowski stressed.

  [Text] Professor Dariusz Rosati is the candidate of the 
Democratic Left Alliance for the post of deputy prime minister 
and minister of finance. Monika Olejnik spoke to the professor, 
who is now working for the UN European Economic Commission in 
Geneva: 
  [Begin Rosati recording] I would like to have a sufficient 
degree of autonomy and independence in managing economic 
affairs, which would ensure the effectiveness of the economic 
policy. To put it briefly, the aim would be that the government 
should speak with one voice on economic affairs. 
  Second, I would like to have the approval of the prime 
minister and of those who will decide that it is I who should be 
looking after finances and economic affairs--an approval with 
respect to the general directions of economic policy--not just 
for three months but perhaps for a medium-term period. [end 
recording] 
  The coalition partners will discuss Prof. Rosati's candidacy 
on 8 March. 
  The president will decide whether to approve Prof. Rosati's 
nomination after his return to Poland, Andrzej Drzycimski, the 
president's spokesman, told PAP. Lech Walesa is returning to 
Poland tomorrow. Drzycimski said that the coalition should make 
decisions that are acceptable to the president. However, as to 
the question of whether the decision on Prof. Rosati's candidacy 
was acceptable to Walesa, Drzycimski only said: I do not know. 
Some time ago, the president said that he would not accept 
Rakowski [Poland's former communist prime minister].

<F P=106> [Interview with General Wojciech Jaruzelski by Maciej </F>
Lukasiewicz; place and date not given: "Not All of the World's 
Sins; How Did It Happen?"] 
  [Text] We continue with our exchange of opinions on 
the reality of the Third Republic. Did the shift to the left 
that occurred on 19 September of last year and the bitter defeat 
by Solidarity-derived parties result from mistakes by new 
political elites, were they a price that was paid for the 
radical reforms, or were they linked to broader processes 
occurring in postcommunist countries? What will Poland's 
political and economic future be like? What will happen next? 
And, above all, how did it happen that political parties 
deriving from the period of the Polish People's Republic [PRL] 
managed to return to power? These are the topics we would like 
to be the subject of common reflection. 
  So far, the following people have spoken out: Jerzy 
Holzer, Zdzislaw Najder, Tomasz Lubienski, Kazimierz Orlos, Jan 
Maria Rokita, Aleksander Hall, Stefan Bratkowski, Jerzy 
Surdykowski, Kazimierz Dziewanowski, Jozef Oleksy, Jerzy 
Giedroyc, Krzysztof Kozlowski, Aleksander Luczak, Slawomir 
Siwek, Aleksander Jerzy Wieczorkowski, and Marek Garztecki. Our 
interviewee today is General Wojciech Jaruzelski. 
  [Lukasiewicz] Did you expect a change of guard on 19 
September of last year, and do you think that society, by 
voting, really was motivated by a yearning for the lost 
communist paradise? 
  [Jaruzelski] Let us begin with the paradise aspect. I do 
not know how it is up in heaven, but, as far as earth is 
concerned, nobody has ever succeeded in establishing a paradise 
here, nor will anybody succeed in doing so in the future. And 
that also applies to a capitalist paradise. It is precisely the 
illusion that the rejection of "communism" will make life better 
almost automatically for everybody and regarding everything that 
became one of the main reasons for social frustration and 
discontent. Disappointment is the kind of feeling that has the 
traits of a boomerang. But this time, it was a yearning not so 
much for the past as for the different. Nobody has any doubts 
anymore that the so-called real socialism is a closed chapter. 
To make it look better in an artificial manner, to try to erase 
mistakes, deformations, or anachronisms, would be both immoral 
and make no political sense. On the other hand, to ascribe all 
of the world's sins to real socialism would be false and 
opportunistic, and would also bring results that are the 
opposite of what had been intended--among other things, last 
year's 19 September election results are an example of that. 
  Every extremism must lose sooner or later. I knew that once 
the pendulum had made its move to one side, it was only a 
question of time before it began moving back to the opposite 
side--that is almost a regular phenomenon in democratic regimes. 
What I did not expect was that it was going to happen so 
quickly. 
  Was that, as you put it, a "change of guard"? Not quite. I 
would rather call it a half-turn. It is true that the current 
government is, as people often say, center-leftist. A 
center-leftist coalition has a big advantage in parliament. But 
there is also the president of the Republic of Poland who, 
although he tries to maintain a balance and be a patron to all 
Poles, clearly has been showing signs of being in favor of the 
"right-wing option," especially recently. Also, it is not the 
government or the parliament but the president who has a 
dominating impact on such key ministries as Defense, Internal 
Affairs, and Foreign Affairs. One must also add to that the 
so-called fourth power--that is a majority of the mass 
media--which rather tends not to have the left wing in its good 
books, to put it in subtle terms. The future will show to what 
extent the current governing configuration will turn out 
permanent or constructive. That will also be a test of a 
feeling of responsibility for the country and of democratic 
manners by all participants of the political scene. I am 
hopeful that this Polish train of ours, although squeaking while 
moving and recently even with sparks flying, will eventually 
manage to avoid a derailing. 
  [Lukasiewicz] Postcommunists are returning to power also in 
other countries of the former Soviet bloc; their return is also 
expected in Hungary in the immediate future. What are the 
reasons for that phenomenon, and do you think the postcommunists 
will manage to bear responsibility for a consistent process of 
continuing with democratic and market reforms? 
  [Jaruzelski] The term "postcommunist" is currently a 
titular kind of phrase, one that is used more as an invective 
than as a substantive evaluation. The fact that somebody used 
to be a member of a communist party does not have to mean an 
uncritical "going back to the sources." Moreover, today many 
former members of the Polish United Workers Party [PZPR] are 
distancing themselves from the past in a vigorous manner. What 
is characteristic in that process is the spectacularity of the 
various personal transformations and conversions. As it turns 
out, a majority of them havealways been reform-oriented. That 
is perhaps not a nice thing from the perspective of political 
aesthetics. But, on the other hand, thanks to the wonderful 
nature of human memory, I think it is probably also frank. In 
that sense, it is also a positive phenomenon because the return 
to power of the so-called postcommunists is not something 
directly linked to political and economic systems. This is even 
more so because the leadership of the Democratic Left Alliance 
[SLD] and the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP] 
derives in most cases from a reform-oriented trend within the 
former PZPR. My view is that the same, with modifications 
taking the party's nature into account, applies also to the 
leadership of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], which derives from 
the United Peasant Accord. After all, they are all definitely 
in favor of principles of parliamentary democracy, the market 
economy, and guaranteeing all civic freedoms. There is just the 
issue of the right instruments, the right proportions, and the 
rate of implementation of the process of political and economic 
transformations. By the way, from that standpoint, there are 
major differences also in the right-wing camp. On certain 
issues, some of the right-wing factions are outrightly populist 
and extremely left-wing. 
  The real left wing must be itself. There are certain 
socially universal, socialist values that are conformant with 
the spirit of a given time and that left-wing parties cannot 
abandon if they do not want to lose credibility or commit a 
historical discredit. The point is that, while implementing the 
necessary and, alas, painful economic reforms, while paying 
determinant attention to economic development, which means a 
prevalence of creative attitudes over ones that are about making 
claims, the point is to at the same time "keep your ear to the 
ground," not to overdo it with the reforms, and to constantly 
have the supreme social goal in view. That is why I think it is 
precisely left-wing, or center-left-wing, forces that have the 
biggest chance for an effective implementation of the reforms. 
After all, the biggest problem is social resistance. By the 
way, that resistance is understandable. The joyous 
anesthetization of 4 June 1989 is over. The ongoing pain 
inflicted by the operation of reforms caused society to have 
rejected the "surgeons" in charge up to now, and also their 
elites, which, by the way, also suffered from infighting. 
Polish society has a great deal of grievance against the left 
wing, especially historical grievance. But society also knows 
that the left wing is, by definition and by virtue of the 
doctrines it is based on, at the same time more socially 
sensitive. That is why the West's reception of the election 
results was also quiet. For the West, the most important thing 
is stability in this part of Europe. It is precisely the center 
left wing that has the greatest chances to alleviate social 
unrest linked to the difficult process of transformations. A 
decomposition and a premature fall of the center left wing could 
bring various solutions to the surface, including extreme 
right-wing, populist, autocratic, or even exotic ones. Would 
that contribute to a widening of the social basis for the 
transformations and, consequently, to increasing the efficiency 
of the reforms? I doubt that. 
  [Lukasiewicz] But how would you assess, generally speaking, 
the four years of rule by the "surgeons"? What do you consider 
to be the biggest achievement of Solidarity-derived cabinets, 
and what do you think were their biggest mistakes? Also, could 
they really have avoided the mistakes, when you bear in mind 
that we were the first and that there had been no past cases of 
"leaving the [communist] system"? 
  [Jaruzelski] I do not want to sound grandiose or moralizing. 
I am a politician of the past, and I am aware of the very 
serious deficiencies of the past type of political and economic 
regime. I am also aware of my own responsibility, which I have 
never tried to evade, nor do I now. I appreciate the historical 
meaning of the changes that were accomplished during the four 
years. So much has been written about that, both in Poland and 
abroad, that it is not easy to say something original on the 
topic. Therefore, I will just mention two achievements that in 
my view are especially significant. In the social and political 
area, it is civic freedoms, broadly speaking. In the economic 
area, it is the convertibility of the zloty and the main 
consequences of that fact. 
  Words of my highest appreciation, though, go to the activity 
of the Tadeusz Mazowiecki government, which, in essence, was of 
a pioneer nature, and also to his personal contribution and his 
serious approach. I cannot imagine his making a statement that 
the communists ruined Poland more than the Nazis did, or showing 
the kind of doctrinal nonchalance toward social problems that 
was displayed by [former Prime Minister] Jan Krzysztof Bielecki. 
I also cannot imagine Mazowiecki being capable of waging the 
kinds of revenge-oriented emotions and file-checking brawls that 
were effected by the government of [former Prime Minister] Jan 
Olszewski. Finally, I also cannot imagine Mazowiecki displaying 
the kind of amazingly self-satisfactory frame of mind, faced 
with a difficult situation of social tensions, that was 
displayed by Hanna Suchocka's government. 
  On the other hand, my view is that, all in all, the biggest 
mistake by Solidarity-derived governments was this specific 
mixture of arrogance and naivete (by the way, from that 
perspective, these governments turned out to have a lot in 
common with many governments in the PRL). We all know the kind 
of message it was based on: We know how to do things best, 
there is no alternative to our ideas; only we, from the 
Solidarity-derived basis, have the right patent for reforms, and 
everybody else is genetically predisposed to be antireform; that 
is the line of thinking in a nutshell. 
  At this point, I would like to take a stand on the view that 
we [the Polish people] were the first, and there had been no 
past experiences of "leaving the system." As a matter of fact, 
we were the "second" in the years 1944-45, inasmuch as the 
events of 1917 had taken place before that. And it was 
precisely the transfer of those 1917 experiences that was the 
main reason for our failures, even if the extent to which those 
experiences were implemented in Poland was small and kept 
getting ever smaller. Still, recently, when we turned out to be 
"the first" this time around, the temptation of imitating 
someone else is what prevailed. True, the models were different 
and better this time, but still not all of them were 
implementable in Poland's situation. The syndrome of a "late 
comer" had its toll on the trend to imitate that I just 
mentioned, and also a desire to just skip some of the phases and 
achieve the standard of living and the way of life being applied 
in countries that are more developed than Poland--in particular, 
in economic terms. That is how all of the mindless following of 
somebody else came about--from Jeffrey Sachs's prescriptions to 
the clownery of Valentine's Day. 
  But it is not possible to ascribe all of the deficiencies 
exclusively to the governing elites. After all, these elites 
operate within the framework of a social and psychological 
situation, to the formation of which they also have contributed 
in some way--that must be said. And what was the situation 
like? Well, to use a columnist's style for a moment, the common 
bread-eaters expected luxury because, after all, the 
"communists" are no longer interfering this or that way, or 
stealing. Many people had the illusion that a moral revolution 
would take place in "our own house," that social pathologies 
would subside, and that people would just be better because, 
after all, the "communists" are no longer trampling on freedom, 
cheating, or showing bad moral examples to the nation. Many of 
the so-called independence-oriented activists were convinced 
that, once sovereignty was gained, one would be able to teach 
Moscow a lesson, while the West would take very good care of us 
in political, economic, and military terms. 
  But that did not materialize. It could not have. And that is 
one of the necessary costs of the systemwide transformation, of 
that "earthquake" that took place in this part of the globe. 
Was it possible to avoid these disappointments? Partially no, 
and partially yes. As far as I can recall, it was Schopenhauer 
who said that people who complain about their lot should 
remember that their fate was mainly shaped by stupid things they 
themselves did. It is beyond doubt an extreme view and one 
clearly biased toward polemics, but there is something rational 
about it. After all, how frequently all of us, former and 
current politicians, like to ascribe all failures to a difficult 
legacy, a disadvantageous domestic and foreign situation, and 
mainly to mistakes committed by our predecessors. And, although 
in many cases such a position is justified, it also has a 
demobilizing effect in a way and directs our attention to the 
past, not to the future. 
  [Lukasiewicz] I must ask you to provide some of your own 
reflections pertaining to your own role and activity: What do 
you consider the biggest achievement and the biggest failure in 
your own life story? 
  [Jaruzelski] Is turning 70 years of age not a success? When 
one has behind oneself the experience of September 1939, a 
deportation to Siberia, a long war-front road of a sniper 
officer, and, finally, all of the stress and burden associated 
with decades of military service and political activity, there 
are reasons to be able to say all of this is a success. But 
there is a personal dimension. As far as the greatest political 
achievement is concerned, which, by the way, was shared by both 
sides of the political barricade and also by church 
representatives back then, I regard the "Roundtable" as the 
biggest achievement. Finally, I treasure in particular my 
military achievements, including 15 years at the post of 
national defense minister. It is a source of pride for me that 
I commanded a good army. I think, even though it may be viewed 
as immodest, that I contributed to securing the Army's combat 
capability, taking into account the possibilities and needs back 
then. On the basis of that structure, in terms of personnel, 
training, and logistics, Poland's defense system is being built 
also today (even though the basis has been modified and adapted 
to contemporary political and international realities). 
  And now as to what I regard to be the biggest failure, or 
actually a life mistake--speaking in personal terms, it was my 
decision to join politics. That put an enormous burden on me, 
and it also brought a lot of bitterness. But I would like to 
expand my answer a bit here. In my view, in politics one can 
speak of defeat in historical dimensions, defeat in strategic 
dimensions, and defeat in tactical dimensions. The last kind of 
defeat unavoidably accompanies the activity of every government, 
to a lesser or greater extent. If a government does not commit 
too many of these defeats, and if they do not manage to become a 
negative process, they are, of course, not pleasant, but they 
still tend not to be a major danger. A historical defeat takes 
place when the defeat's all-national impact is of enormous 
importance and when it is first of all irreplaceable and also 
accompanied by a heavy bloodbath. My conscience is not stained 
with a defeat of this kind. And, finally, a strategic defeat: 
It does not always have to be linked to a specific decision, 
act, or fact. In my view, the fact that I failed to lead to a 
national agreement before 13 December 1981 is such a defeat. I 
said and wrote a lot about the reasons for that. Right now, I 
would just like to air what may be regarded as a controversial 
view, but it is one that has been confirmed by life practice: 
Martial law was a common defeat. But, however paradoxical that 
may also sound, martial law was also a common victory. I am 
saying that because, while not ignoring the tragedy that 
occurred at the Wujek coal mine or other painful issues and 
events, we are not divided by an insurmountable abyss. That 
made it possible, going step by step on a winding and rough 
road, to come to the "Roundtable" and sign an agreement. What 
turned out impossible for domestic and external reasons in 1981 
became realistic in 1989. 
  [Lukasiewicz] I would like to return to martial law for a 
moment. You said during a conversation with THE NEW YORK TIMES 
last year that, if the situation of 13 years ago was repeated 
right now, you would prefer to commit suicide than introduce 
martial law again. Why is that? 
  [Jaruzelski] And tell me, would any sane person want to find 
himself again in the same kind of situation, with all of its 
nightmare, and be faced with the most dramatic decision of his 
life? My statement, which you cited, should be interpreted 
precisely in that sense. The statement was about personal and 
human aspects. As regards a political assessment of the 
decision to introduce martial law, I have presented it on many 
occasions, and I find no reason to change it now. 
  [Lukasiewicz] Some of your colleagues from the past have 
been proposing a thesis from time to time--in the context of the 
famous theory of "choosing the lesser evil"--that the 
"Roundtable" talks and the subsequent changes in Poland would 
not have taken place if it had not been for martial law. Do you 
share this view, and, if so, my question is: Could it not have 
been done sooner? Why did it have to take as long as eight 
years? 
  [Jaruzelski] Yes, I do indeed share the view you mentioned. 
After all, the view expresses a knowledge and an awareness of 
the fact that martial law prevented a multidimensional disaster. 
It is not my intention to diminish the evil--in particular, the 
personal harm--that martial law caused. But, on the other hand 
and objectively speaking, it also created a chance for the 
gradual development of the right conditions for fundamental 
changes that occurred later. Attempts to demonstrate that the 
introduction of martial law was accompanied by an idea of 
surrendering power and paving the way for capitalism in Poland 
would of course be ridiculous. But it is true that the 
extraordinary measures that were undertaken at the time made it 
possible to reduce the extremely high social tensions that were 
close to eruption, to maintain the indispensable leadership of 
the country, and to prevent economic destruction. 
  Various types of reform-oriented measures were undertaken to 
follow that. It is true that their extent was limited, but it 
was not a "black hole," nevertheless. In June 1989, not 
everything started from scratch. Also in previous years there 
were searches, experiences, embryos, and bridgeheads. We were a 
heretic island within the [socialist] bloc, in the 
"pre-Gorbachev" years. In the years of perestroyka, Poland 
became a testing ground for various tests and measures. 
Finally, the "Roundtable" and its consequences occurred as an 
incentive and a model for transformations throughout the region. 
So one can put it this way: Martial law froze the political 
and social arrangement that was formed in the 1980-81 period. 
It transferred the arrangement into a different historical time 
and a different geopolitical dimension, into a situation where 
the idea of national agreement became the only way to resolve 
Polish problems. After all, the "Roundtable" was, in essence, a 
repetition of the concept of the National Agreement Council, 
which I had suggested in the fall of 1981. Even what happened 
in Magdalenka was to a certain extent a reflection of the 
so-called initiating group that was supposed to come to 
agreement and suggest the council's structure and functions. 
  However, there is the question of whether it all could have 
been done earlier, faster, and better. It undoubtedly could 
have. Today I can see various mistakes and inconsistencies, 
setbacks, and delays more clearly. However, any "great leap," 
both for external and internal reasons, was not possible in that 
reality. If even today, in a new political and international 
reality, there emerge such great obstacles on the road of 
thorough economic transformations, one can imagine what the 
obstacles were in that period. Apart from that, we were very 
strict about the social duties of the state, which often took 
precedence over the economy. It is worth recalling how many 
apartments were built in the martial law period: in 1982, 
approximately 185,000; in 1983, over 195,000; in the years that 
followed, until 1989, the numbers were similar. At the same 
time, I still remember the charge that was leveled at me: One 
has to wait for an apartment as long as 30 years. Now that we 
build fewer apartments, such complaints have become less 
audible. However, I think that the people still remember 
various social solutions. In the last elections, the Polish 
people showed that certain achievements, which martial law also 
protected, are very close to them. I am not saying this from 
the position of "Now, what did I tell you?," but I am rather 
encouraging a quiet, sine ira et studio reflection on 
the entire complexity of the past road. 
  [Lukasiewicz] However, despite the fact that the governing 
administration has changed, the responsibility for imposing 
martial law is still a subject of constitutional proceedings. 
Do you not think that the so-called Suslov documents played a 
role here? I mean the documents that suggest that you did not 
rule out the possibility of requesting help from the "Soviet 
comrades". [Jaruzelski] I already discussed this topic 
in RZECZPOSPOLITA twice (25-26 September and 6-7 November 1993). 
No one has refuted the substance of those explanations. How 
many times must we recall the desperate efforts we made so that 
our Polish problems would remain ours? This is what happened. 
This is concrete and palpable proof; it is more important than 
any sensational news that is contrary to it. 
  It is worth noting that the order for them came from Poland. 
This was proved by its evident selectiveness and by taking 
advantage of it in the preelection period. The way the previous 
management of television used this topic was very significant; 
it allowed me to present my explanations only two weeks after 
the elections. The following fact is very important here: Unlike 
the case of many other documents from the already mentioned 
Archives, protocols signed by a secretary of the Central 
Committee [KC], the only pretext for this "sensation" was not a 
protocol, but an unsigned working note. The fact that the list 
of people participating in that session did not include the name 
of Mikhail Gorbachev is characteristic. In several interviews 
he stated that the Politburo of KC of the Communist Party of the 
Soviet Union did not take such things into consideration. There 
are also other arguments in this issue that I have already 
explained, among others, in RZECZPOSPOLITA. Their meaning has 
been strengthened by the recently revealed documents from the 
archives of the former German Democratic Republic. I think that 
similar materials can also be found in former Czechoslovakia. 
  I must recall again, however, that I never put the external 
factor in first place. I have often said, also in my book 
The Martial Law. Why... that it would have been 
below my dignity as an officer if I had used the pretext of some 
external disposition or directive. However, it is true that the 
awareness of the seriousness of the situation hung over us like 
a black cloud. Such was the logic of the geostrategic division 
of Europe and the world. Disregarding it would have meant 
playing with the fate of the nation and the state. Various 
accusers of the so-called authors of martial law are becoming 
ludicrous. They claim that we were not threatened by anything 
at that time; however, today, in a much more advantageous 
international situation, they feel great anxiety because of 
every other statement by Zhirinovskiy. We can also say the same 
about the very nervous reactions to the possibility of 
decreasing the gas supply from Russia for a time, even though 
this possibility was only slightly signaled in 1992. Now, how 
much more dangerous it all looked at the end of 1981. The 
Soviets almost delivered an ultimatum, announcing that they 
would drastically cut the supplies of gas, oil, and many other 
raw materials and commodities. The results would have been 
catastrophic. 
  Therefore, we must take an objective look at the past, 
primarily at our common Polish faults. At that time, we, both 
the authorities and Solidarity, were not mature enough to reach 
an agreement. Today many activists of the opposition of that 
time proudly call those events a rebellion, an insurrection. I 
feel respect for the freedom-oriented, democratic intentions of 
those activities--all the more so because, as it is said 
informally, not even one windowpane was broken at that time. 
However, the economy was destroyed, with all of the material and 
biological effects of that on the people; the functioning of the 
state was paralyzed, and confrontation was a real danger. If 
someone has a poor memory, he will find the confirmation of this 
evaluation in countless archival materials that illustrated that 
situation and the consequent circumstances of the introduction 
of martial law. I also feel that we should recall many 
confidential and public statements by Western and Eastern 
politicians, as well as by many foreign publications. 
  In light of all those facts, one can only be surprised at 
the 
decision of the previous Sejm, which started proceedings in the 
Constitutional Responsibility Committee. A dramatically complex 
problem, which will be disputed by historians for decades, has 
been subjected to a procedure that is burdened with political 
emotions. Instead, in line with the wise Spanish model, 
shortening the distance and linking, we will recreate historical 
antagonisms and divisions in modern wrappings. This will not be 
beneficial either to Poland, or even to the political circles 
that have inherited the oppositional ethos. The hearing of 
evidence will reveal and recall many issues that I believe the 
extremist circles of the Solidarity of that period would rather 
forget. Who, then, needs this? 
  [Lukasiewicz] Let us, however, revert to the present. Do 
you think the democratic mechanisms, which have no doubt been 
implemented by the Solidarity governments, are so lasting that 
the next change of the governing elites will be made in an 
equally peaceful manner as the one on 19 September? 
  [Jaruzelski] I fully appreciate the role of the Solidarity 
governments in the process of implementing democratic 
mechanisms. I think that the Polish people, despite the fact 
that they are critical of some manifestations of the 
parliament's activities, have really been bitten by the bug of 
democracy. Therefore, any nondemocratic moves would have been 
evaluated critically. Frequent elections and changes of 
parliaments and governments, even due to the costs of these 
operations, are not received enthusiastically. There are not 
many people left who believe in slogans and promises. Tired of 
the turmoil of not really understandable disputes and conflicts, 
people want some stabilization. No authorities can enjoy their 
honeymoon periods for a long time. The popularity of 
politicians is changeable, all the more so because there is 
enough fuel for social tensions. The tensions can primarily be 
found in the difficult living conditions of many people in 
Poland. The Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity" 
can see a chance for itself there. It is a union that 
particularly willingly employs the instrument of protests and 
strikes. The political reality has changed, but they still say 
"bad government" and "down with communists." The All-Polish 
Trade Unions Agreement, even though more numerous and often 
treated as a postsocialist relic, did not create as many 
problems even to the Solidarity governments as Solidarity is 
creating now. Its destabilizing moves, politically backed by 
radically rightist circles, may disturb the rhythm of the 
functioning and of the normal changes of the democratically 
elected state authorities. 
  Also, the conflict between the president and the parliament 
adds to this situation. The statement made by Deputy Jerzy 
Jaskiernia in the Sejm seemed to me to be more convincing than 
the arguments put forward by Minister Lech Falandysz. However, 
it was also wrong and unseemly to reject the president's motion 
without forwarding it to the committees and without a debate 
that might have resulted in some compromise solution. Even 
though the rules of democracy were not slighted, the president 
may have perceived this decision as an act of disrespect and 
arrogance. This may have been the reason for such an emotional 
response, which, however, was rather exaggerated to the rank of 
the event. However, Lech Walesa is a realist. He plays 
roughly, to be sure, and not always fairly; he goes especially 
far in rhetoric. In practice, however, he does not go beyond 
the playground thatc is called democracy. I am also convinced 
that the other party to the conflict will have enough composure 
and restraint. Therefore, we should only hope that the present 
situation will not turn into a "war in high places," which would 
be detrimental primarily to Poland. No one can really gain 
anything in such a war. Everyone will be defeated. 
  [Lukasiewicz] Apologizing right after the elections in 
rather general terms to all those who suffered under the old 
system, Aleksander Kwasniewski announced that there would be no 
comeback either to the communist past, or to the republic of 
"Solidarity buddies." However, what we have recently been 
witnessing in the cadre policy does look like the recreation of 
the "republic of buddies," the only difference being that they 
are from "a different shelf." What do you think about that? 
Slogans are only slogans, but a concrete policy is carried out 
by concrete people. 
  [Jaruzelski] Aleksander Kwasniewski told the truth--there is 
no going back to the past system, and there is no retreating 
from the road of democratic and free-market-oriented 
transformations. This is the most important assumption. It is 
confirmed by practice. Personnel moves, however important they 
are, are not able to change the generally accepted direction. 
Actually, there is no such intention. The differences in views 
on the transformations concern the technology, not the 
foundations. Of course, the people in the administration quite 
considerably influence the implementation process. Therefore, I 
understand the sensitivity to personnel decisions. Over the 
four years of the Solidarity governments a thorough change, 
especially in the people in managerial positions, was made. The 
substantive criteria were often not taken into account. Apart 
from justified decisions, most of them were dictated by the 
political past and membership. This was often accompanied by 
revenge and looting. This must not be repeated in the new 
situation. However, I believe that lifelong anathemas imposed 
on people active before 1989, and consequent nervous reactions 
to the present personnel moves cannot block the changes. Of 
course, if the necessary requirements concerning their 
qualifications, competence, loyalty, and morale are satisfied. 
  I do not know exactly the scale of the personnel changes 
that 
are being made now, nor do I know to what extent they can be 
said to be controversial from the viewpoint of qualifications. 
I believe, however, that too far-reaching generalizations 
should be avoided. This does not mean, of course, that we should 
close our eyes to such moves which, being a play of various 
pressures, would lead to clique configurations, weaker than 
their predecessors as far as their competence and functioning 
are concerned. The most important criterion must be the 
potential and real efficiency of the persons' activities. 
  [Lukasiewicz] How long do you think the so-called left wing 
will govern the country, especially after the recent crisis in 
the governing coalition, and after the increasing differences 
within the leftist parliamentary clubs have become visible? 
  [Jaruzelski] I am a supporter of the left wing. I hope it 
will stay in power for a long time, at least until the end of 
the term. It must be remembered that a complex program of 
transformations can only be implemented over three or four 
years; I mean a program of transformations that would harmonize 
the mechanisms of economic growth with social goals, which is 
extremely difficult. This coalition has the greatest chance to 
do this. Both components of the coalition know that a different 
composition is not very real (PSL) and entirely unreal (SLD). 
This should also have a soothing influence on internal 
factional-centrifugal trends within the parties. However, even 
possible factions do not necessarily have to lead to the 
disturbing of the fundamental potential of each of the 
groupings. However, there will be no idyll. The differences 
are quite considerable in some areas. However, "first, do not 
disturb." Being in a coalition is an art of compromise, the 
ability to be above the parochial interests in the name of 
higher issues. All the more so because after all no one in the 
coalition will become stronger only because someone else will be 
weaker--in this way the whole is weaker. I believe in the 
intelligence, pragmatism, and the feeling of responsibility of 
Waldemar Pawlak and Aleksander Kwasniewski. These young 
leaders--age being their great advantage--are quite different, 
but for this reason they complement each other. I think that in 
the long run they can gain a strategic victory only if they 
stick together. This is not easy. However, whoever has agreed 
to carry the burden of power, whoever treats the interest of the 
state as the most important thing, must have the courage and 
wisdom to walk this proverbial line. 
  [Lukasiewicz] Finally, let us go beyond Polish reality. 
How do you evaluate the recent years of the Polish foreign 
policy, and do you share the opinion that only the closest 
possible relations of Poland with the West can assure us 
security? The Russian elections and the statements not only by 
Zhirinovskiy, but also recently by Yeltsin himself and persons 
related to him, such as Grachev or Kozyrev, reveal increasingly 
clearly the imperial appetites of Russia. It seems that it 
would have nothing against including us in its zone of influence 
once again. 
  [Jaruzelski] This is a broad and extensively discussed 
subject. I will, therefore, confine myself to several general 
remarks, because I do not feel entitled to evaluate the Polish 
foreign policy as a whole; I have too little information and 
up-to-date knowledge. Its most important elements are hidden in 
the safes of appropriate chancelleries, headquarters, and 
ministries. However, as I look at it from a certain distance, I 
can say that my evaluation of the policy pursued by Andrzej 
Olechowski is higher than the evaluation of the policy of his 
predecessor, whom I know very well and highly value for his 
activeness between 1986-89, when he was a member of the 
Consultation Council of the Chairman of the State of PRL. I 
think that the communicativeness and dynamics of the present 
foreign policy are much bigger. Apart from the understandable 
involvement and anchorage in the West, the activities in the 
eastern direction have increased; the economic aspect is also 
stressed. 
  For a few years now Poland has felt the comfort of relations 
with its great eastern neighbor, relations based on equal 
rights. I believe that this allows us to lower the temperature 
of reactions to historical events. There is no doubt that as 
far as the issues of national security are concerned, one can 
never stand at ease. However, emotions are a bad adviser as 
well. In other words, we must open our eyes wider than we open 
our mouths. Historical-psychological factors should not take 
precedence over cool, substantive analysis. I have the 
military, professional habit of getting to the core of a matter; 
I usually start with the evaluation of the forces, the 
possibilities, and probable intentions of the other side, let us 
say. Then one's own forces and possibilities should be 
evaluated. This is supplemented by an analysis of other 
accompanying conditions; as a result, by seeing the difference 
between the possible and the real threat, one can draw the right 
conclusions: For today, for tomorrow, and for the day after 
tomorrow. I believe that a quiet, substantive analysis of the 
international situation, a pragmatic calculation of the gains 
and losses would allow us to have more options, adequate to the 
actual and forecast situation. Of course, the problem is 
extremely important. Therefore, both the official stance of the 
authorities and the published materials show the world our 
options and expectations. At the same time they enrich the 
knowledge and the feeling of joint responsibility of the people 
for the future of the country. This should be one of the most 
important levers strengthening the political, economic, and 
defense condition of Poland. 
  "Hell is paved" with treaties and guarantees. They are 
really credible only when they are in agreement with the broadly 
understood interests of the state that issues the guarantees. 
Adam Daniel Rotfeld, director of the Stockholm Institute of 
Peace Research (SPIRI), writes that right now no one in the West 
can see a "danger from the East," but only "danger in the East," 
and in addition, of an unpredictable character. Only a Poland 
that is socially stable, economically healthy, and politically 
predictable will be a valuable and really protected link in the 
European order and security. 
  One more conclusion is to be vigilant and ready, but, at the 
same time, to do everything to have friends not only far, but 
also near.

  [Text] Lodz, 7 Mar--Piotr Zak, press spokesman of the 
National Commission of the Independent Self-Governing Trade 
Union Solidarity [NSZZ], declared today that the union was ready 
for a strike "that could last weeks". 
  Zak refused to divulge details of Monday's debates by 
Solidarity's national section for the metallurgical industry, 
which were held in Lodz. He reported that there would a session 
of the National Commission of NSZZ Solidarity in Lodz on 9 March. 
  "We have presented our areas of negotiation to the 
government, and we intend to talk exclusively about specific 
matters--for example, about how the profamily tax system is to 
be introduced and about the price increases by energy carriers," 
Zak told a PAP journalist. 
  The National Commission spokesman said: "The union is 
examining the possibility of making life difficult for those 
governing the country." Solidarity wants social disruption 
caused by the strike to be as limited as possible. It is for 
that reason, for example, that Solidarity's national section for 
the power industry plans first to cut electricity in public 
offices and among those industrial customers who owe the 
industry money. 
  Zak said that payments from the Solidarity strike fund would 
also be received by those taking part in the Solidarity strike 
who were not union members and who were members of other trade 
union federations.

  [Text] Warsaw, 8 Mar--In the opinion of Marian Krzaklewski, 
Solidarity is now concentrating on spreading the protest action 
according to the snowball principle. The Solidarity leader said 
on the Polish Radio Third Programme on 8 March that the action 
would be implemented with all force to "make the government sit 
down at the negotiating table at last." 
  According to him, consensus is possible, although the 
government decision has made talks difficult. "I think that 
consensus is a real possibility, but the political decision made 
by the government has made talks with the union impossible," 
Krzaklewski said, adding that "some leaked information had 
reached him on the subject" because some union members tried to 
mediate in order to bring about talks with the government. 
  Krzaklewski did not want to comment more on the "leaks." He 
only added that this was an "initiative of people of goodwill" 
who wanted to bring about mediation by talking to high-ranking 
state officials, from whom they got a reply that the government 
would not be discussing the demands that had been put forward. 
"I am surprised about this, and I think it is a clear challenge 
for Solidarity and an attempt to test the union," Krzaklewski 
said.

  [Text] Katowice, 8 Mar--A two-hour warning strike was 
organized on Tuesday by the Independent Self-Governing Trade 
Union [NSZZ] Solidarity Steelworks National Division [SKH NSZZ 
Solidarity] as part of a nationwide Solidarity protest action, 
Wlodzimierz Lewandowski, deputy chairman of the SKH NSZZ 
Solidarity, told PAP. 
  Lewandowski said that the strikes were taking place in a 
variety of forms. The protest action is to draw attention to 
the financial problems of employees and their families. The 
teams from the raw material departments have not discontinued 
the technological processes so as not to make the financial 
situation of their steelworks even worse. The strike action has 
been joined by the workers of the Bankowa, Zawiercie, Baildon, 
Batory, Bobrek, and 1 Maja steelworks, among others. At the 
Katowice steelworks, the protest action had been limited to 
collecting money for the strike fund, Renata Bytomska, the 
steelworks press spokeswoman, told PAP.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Henryk Kunik, chairman of the Board of </F>
the Katowice Chamber of the Metallurgical Industry and Trade, by 
correspondent Henryk Nykiel; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Nykiel] The past year was not the worst that the 
Polish metallurgical industry has know to date. Does this mean 
that it is on the way up from its worst depression? 
  [Kunik] Unfortunately not. Although it is true that, after 
a few years of recession, we have noted a slight increase in the 
output of steel and rolled steel products, as well as some 
improvement in the industry's economic situation, the condition 
of our sector is still critical. Our steel mills face the 
threat that the banks will block their accounts and that their 
supplies of power, gas, coal, and scrap metal will be 
discontinued. The majority of our steelworks show an adverse 
balance of payments. Exporting their goods often proves 
unprofitable, while the chances of selling them in the domestic 
market decrease steadily because there are not enough 
potential--and solvent--customers. 
  [Nykiel] Are there no better prospects for 1994? 
  [Kunik] There are no indications of any surge of activity in 
investment projects. Unless this happens, it is certain that we 
will witness a decrease rather than an increase in production. 
Sales dropped already in both January and February. In 
addition, our steelworks have found themselves caught in a 
costs-and-prices dilemma. The prices of energy and raw 
materials, which influence the costs of production, are dictated 
by official state monopoly-holders. Consequently, to balance 
their accounts, steelworks are forced to raise the prices of 
their products. But, by the same token, they become less 
competitive and lose potential clients in both the free domestic 
market and abroad. 
  [Nykiel] We also hear of the danger of competition from 
outside.... 
  [Kunik] ...which is most serious. Despite all of its 
official declarations, the government still does not treat the 
metallurgical industry as a strategic sector of the economy. 
There is practically no protection extended to the internal 
market (because imports tariffs alone are decidedly 
insufficient). As a result, the domestic market is swamped with 
cheap products from former CEMA countries as well as similar 
goods from Western countries. At the same time, the European 
Community, acting through Eurofer [European association of steel 
companies], imposes on us trading quotas that serve exclusively 
to protect the interests of EEC states. The EC's declared 
interest in restructuring the Polish metallurgical industry is 
more ostentatious than real, and it is largely restricted to 
making empty promises clothed in winsome gestures. In reality, 
major steel concerns have been preparing aggressive sales 
programs in order to reinforce their position in the Polish 
market by setting up whole networks of agencies selling their 
steel products here. 
  [Nykiel] Is the Chamber of Metallurgical Industry and Trade 
unable to force the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the 
government to make and implement decisions that would allow you 
to throroughly restructure and modernize your sector? 
  [Kunik] We notified successive ministers and prime ministers 
many times of our alarm at the deteriorating condition of our 
sector; we told them of the dangers threatening the 
metallurgical industry, and, at the same time, we suggested 
possible solutions that could avert these dangers. The central 
administration arrogantly left all of our messages and alarm 
signals unanswered. Recently, acting in conjunction with 
individual steelworking plants, our Chamber prepared a 
restructuring and modernization project, complete with a 
timetable of recommended implementation and consistent with all 
of the provisions written into the ministry's own study 
document. We submitted this project to the Industry Ministry 
and the government. We also drafted a proposal for setting up a 
dedicated institution that could direct the implementation of 
the project, as well as a separate proposal for creating a 
strong organization, Polish Steel SA [joint-stock company], to 
be endowed with the necessary powers and decisionmaking 
competence to protect the interests of the Polish metallurgical 
industry. Again, we have had no reaction at all to our 
proposals. This silence is surprising even to certain bodies 
within the European Community, which certainly expected the 
Polish Government to demonstrate greater readiness to help one 
of their more important state industries. 
  [Nykiel] We often hear allegations that Polish 
steelworkers demand huge sums of money from the 
government--money the government simply does not have. 
  [Kunik] That is not true. The main sources of funds for the 
financing of our restructuring operations will be bank loans and 
steelworks' own resources. We are first and foremost interested 
in persuading the government to introduce appropriate tax and 
investment policies and securing government guarantees on our 
loans because, without such guarantees, we will be unable to 
obtain funds for modernization and development from foreign 
banks. On the other hand, we pin our hopes on obtaining the 
necessary funds for social welfare provisions associated with 
restructuring the employment profile of the sector from both the 
budget and the World Bank--as we were promised according to a 
provision written into the ministry's study document. We 
estimate that, during the next six years, some 80,000 employees 
will leave the metallurgical sector. This problem cannot be 
solved by individual plants and their management on their own. 
The only thing is that we do not know who will end up with that 
particular milestone tied to his neck and dragging him into deep 
water.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 7 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime 
Minister Radoje Kontic said on Monday that the establishing of a 
peace in the territory of the former Yugoslavia is his 
government's priority and that the urgent lifting of the U.N. 
sanctions would considerably speed up this process. 
  The sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
border on a genocide against a nation and their consequences 
have acquired the proportions of war operations, Kontic said 
during talks in Belgrade with a delegation of the Greek 
committee for humanitarian aid to the people of the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  The Yugoslav Information Ministry announced that Kontic said 
that the sanctions are counterproductive and are an expression 
of the inability of the international community to resolve 
regional conflicts. Underscoring Greece's objective approach to 
the resolution of the Yugoslav crisis, Kontic said that the 
tragedy in the former Yugoslavia would not have occurred if the 
other members of the European Community had taken the same stand. 
  Kontic expressed gratitude to the Greek delegation, headed 
by 
the honorary president of the World Council for Peace and the 
president of the Greek Anti-War Committee, Evangelos Makheras, 
for everything Athens and the Greek people have done for the 
resolution of the Yugoslav crisis and in sending the 
humanitarian aid which has saved many lives and reduced the 
suffering of the people. 
  "We believe that Greece, as the chairman of the European 
Union, will do everything towards reaching a political solution 
to the Yugoslav crisis, and this will be the biggest 
humanitarian aid," Kontic said. 
  Makheras pointed out that the lifting of the sanctions is a 
priority of the Greek Anti-War Committee and the committee for 
aiding the people of the former yugoslavia. "We are opposed to 
all forms of sanctions because they are aimed against the 
people," he said. Makheras informed Kontic that his 
humanitarian organization had three months ago requested from 
the U.N. sanctions committee permission to send an additional 
550 tonnes of relief aid, but has received no answer so far. 
Although humanitarian aid is exempt from the sanctions, it 
arrives in Yugoslavia infrequently and in insufficient 
quantities due to the inefficiency of the U.N. sanctions 
committee. 
  The almost two-year strict blockade of Yugoslavia has 
gravely 
affected the health and living standards of the 10.5 million 
Yugoslavs and some 600,000 registered refugees from the former 
Yugoslav republics.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 7 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Minister of 
Human and Minority Rights Margit Savovic said on Monday that the 
U.N. Human Rights Commission was unwilling to have a discussion 
on sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), because the 
United Nations had violated the Yugoslavs' basic human rights by 
voting for the sanctions in the first place. 
  Minister Savovic said Yugoslavia was being accused of 
violating human and minority rights, while the rights of its 
citizens were being violated by the U.N. sanctions, and its 
population was surviving in inhuman conditions through a sheer 
will to live. 
  The Yugoslav Government has filed countless memoranda with 
the United Nations, apprising it about the difficult position of 
the children, women, the ill and the elderly in the country and 
making it clear that "our people have virtually been deprived of 
the right to live, and the sanctions have violated a host of 
U.N. conventions, but nothing has been done about it," she said 
in a statement to Serbia's Radio Jagodina. 
  "The United Nations is well aware that a discussion on the 
anti-Yugoslav sanctions would call in question their further 
justifiability since Yugoslavia has complied with all 
requirements for their lifting. It would also broach the highly 
unpleasant question of why the United Nations is violating its 
own conventions," she said. 
  The United Nations imposed comprehensive and mandatory 
sanctions on Yugoslavia in May 1992, because of its alleged 
military involvement in civil war in neighbouring 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is being waged among Bosnia's Moslems, 
Serbs and Croats. 
  Margit Savovic said that more than 180,000 Serbs were living 
in Albania, Hungary and Romania, and their position there "is 
far different from that of the minorities in Yugoslavia." 
  "They are deprived of rights in all fields, from the right 
to 
education in their mother tongue, to information, cultural 
development and power-sharing, to being assimilated," she said. 
  Yugoslavia "has no intention of insisting on reciprocity, 
but 
wants its minorities to retain their rights, and the rights of 
the Serbs in the neighbouring countries to be enhanced to 
correspond to those the national minorities have here," she 
explained.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Slavoljub Susic] </F>
  [Text] The latest request for additional UN troops in the 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina could be understood more as the 
confirmation of the assessment of the better informed analysts 
that the Balkans is a special experimental arena of the creators 
of the new world order than an indication that this hotbed of 
crisis would soon be mollified. Here is a military-political 
commentary by Slavoljub Susic: 
  [Susic] It is indicative that almost all new peace proposals 
for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina are followed by requests to 
increase the UN military contingent to supervise the 
implementation of these proposals. Does this mean that there is 
an a priori doubt about the effectiveness of the offered 
solutions that are drafted most frequently according to the 
interests of foreign factors? 
  Let us recall that the failure of Cutiliero's plan in Lisbon 
in 1991 was followed by the dispatch of the first battalion of 
the UN Blue Helmets to Sarajevo -- consisting of soldiers from 
France, Ukraine, and Egypt -- with the task of securing the 
airport for the delivery of humanitarian aid. After the London 
conference on the former Yugoslavia in August of the same year, 
NATO's offer to protect relief convoys in Bosnia under the UN 
mandate was accepted. By the end of 1992, there were about 7,000 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina from 10 member countries of the Western 
military alliance. 
  After Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zepa, Gorazde, Bihac, and Srebrenica 
were declared protected zones in May 1993, the Security Council 
decided to increase the existing contingent with an additional 
7,600 troops. This was not fully realized. After the well-known 
Geneva plans for the settlement of the crisis in Bosnia, offered 
during 1993, there were about 12,000 Blue Helmets in Bosnia and 
more than 26,000 troops on the territory of the entire former 
Yugoslavia. That year, more than $1 billion was spent on their 
mission. 
  In order to ensure the implementation of the Security 
Council 
resolutions adopted so far and the agreements reached by the 
warring parties, including the agreement reached on the creation 
of the Muslim-Croat federation in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina 
in Washington this week, with a possibility of including it in a 
confederation with Croatia, Mr. Akashi, special envoy of the UN 
secretary general, and General Cot, the chief commander of the 
peace forces, are asking for an additional 10,650 troops. If 
this request, which is also strongly favored by British General 
Michael Rose, commander of the peace forces in Bosnia, is met, 
then the mission on the territory of the former Yugoslavia with 
nearly 40,000 deployed troops and other staff would be the 
largest and the most expensive peace operation by the United 
Nations since its founding. 
  Judging by the mood in Europe and on the other side of the 
Atlantic, it appears that the request for additional forces will 
not be met. Russia has offered to send another 300 troops to 
Bosnia in addition to the 400 troops already deployed there. 
This has been received with visible uneasiness in the West. 
  The United States, on the other hand, sees its contribution 
in support to the air force's mission, remaining consistent with 
its view not to send land forces to the Bosnian nightmare before 
an effective peace agreement acceptable to all three sides in 
the conflict has been reached. One could not object to this at 
all if the U.S. policy was in line with this stand. However, it 
is known that Washington favors the Muslims and the Croats in 
particular. This is confirmed by the latest separate agreement 
between these two sides without the participation of the third, 
the Serbian side. 
  Thus, the fear of the possible renewal of the 
Muslim-Croatian 
coalition, which, supported by powerful protectors, could renew 
and even expand territorial and other demands to the detriment 
of the Serbs, is justifiable. The old slogan that there are 
many Russians and us will not be of much help to the Serbs, 
because one must take into account the fact that Russia as an 
indisputably big and influential power has strategic interests 
in the Balkans as a whole, as well as partnership relations with 
the United States and other developed countries in the West. 
Therefore, our expectations should not exceed the level of that 
reality. 
  Russia would do enough if it contributes to the halting of 
further experimenting with the peoples in this region by the 
creators of the new world order and if it helps in finding a 
compromise solution acceptable to all sides. In that case even 
a symbolic contingent of UN peace forces would be sufficient.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 8 (TANJUG) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's special envoy Charles Redman arrived in Belgrade on 
Tuesday morning and, as it has been learned, is shortly to meet 
with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. 
  Redman, it has been learned, has not brought with him any 
concrete proposals, and obviously means only to hear Belgrade's 
position on the U.S. initiative for the creation of a 
Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The question of 
the Bosnian Serb side has been left open in that context. 
  An answer has, however, come from Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan 
Karadzic, who has said that "only political illiterates can 
expect the Serbs in Bosnia to accept a confederative model with 
the Muslims and Croats," and who has underscored that only two 
possibilities exist as far as the Bosnian Serbs are concerned -- 
"an independent Serb state in Bosnia or the unification of the 
Bosnian Serbs with the other Serbs into a single state." 
  It is believed that Milosevic and Redman will exchange views 
on the enhancement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina negotiating 
process, which is to produce a comprehensive settlement 
acceptable to all three warring sides in the former Yugoslav 
republic. 
  According to unconfirmed reports, Redman will meet in 
Belgrade also with Vice-President of the Bosnian Serb Republic 
Nikola Koljevic.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 7 (TANJUG)--Serbia's Deputy 
Commissioner for Refugees Slobodan Popovic said on Monday that 
Germany's decision to expell refugees who hold Yugoslav 
passports was uncalled for, in view of the fact that the refugee 
status is regulated under international law which protects 
refugees everywhere in the world. 
  In a statement made to TANJUG, Popovic specified that, since 
the outbreak of war in former Yugoslavia, between 17,000 and 
20,000 refugees from the breakaway Yugoslav Republics of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia have transited through Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) on their way to Germany as well as to 
America, Asia and Australia. 
  "German authorities appear to see the refugees in only one 
light--viz, as Yugoslavs," Popovic said. 
  Germany has announced its intention to begin expelling the 
refugees from Serbia and Montenegro in three days' time. The 
local press estimates that the decision will affect about 
200,000 refugees, mainly Bosnian Serbs and ethnic Albanians from 
the Serbian province of Kosovo-Metohija -- holders of Yugoslav 
passports. 
  The Serbian commissioner for refugees believes that this 
unprecedented move on the part of Germany is meant to provoke a 
reaction from Yugoslavia which would then be taken as a pretext 
to continue to pursue the present anti-Yugoslav policy. 
  The German weekly DER SPIEGEL estimates there are about 
350,000 refugees from former Yugoslavia in Germany, 230,000 of 
whom have come from Serbia and Montenegro. This number 
obviously includes Serbs from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia who 
have refused to renounce their Yugoslav citizenship at the time 
of the disintegration of the Balkan federation and take the 
citizenship of the newly-proclaimed states.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ilija Ilijevski, chairman of the Human </F>
Rights Party of FYROM, by Galya Nikolova; place and date not 
given: "Our Party Was Banned Because of Its Good Relations With 
Bulgaria"] 
  [Text] [Nikolova] Mr. Ilijevski, when and why was your 
party banned? 
  [Ilijevski] It was banned a month and a half ago. The 
decision of the Okrug Court in Stip became binding over a week 
ago. Its sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. 
It is interesting to note that the court in Stip banned us 
because we were described as a threat to the country's 
constitutional order. However, we think that the old 
constitution is not binding any longer, because there is a new 
Constitution. It bans violent anticonstitutional actions, but 
our party has not been accused of any such actions. When 
Macedonia's Supreme Court discovered this paradox it amended the 
legal basis of the ban. We were accused of fanning 
international and interethnic hatred. We cannot even utilize 
our constitutional right to appeal against this judgment any 
longer because the reason for it has been changed, and our 
appeal was based on the previous reason. 
  We sought the protection of Macedonia's chief prosecutor and 
demanded that the Constitutional Court cancel the ban because it 
violates the Constitution. We have informed international legal 
organizations and the governments of many countries. We most 
fervently appeal to official Bulgaria, because we think that it 
has the greatest reason to help us. Our party was banned 
because of its good relations with Bulgaria. 
  [Nikolova] How did the Bulgarian authorities react to this? 
  [Ilijevski] Unfortunately, before and after 10 November 1989 
Sofia's policy toward the Bulgarians in Macedonia did not 
change. We were left in the hands of the Serbian state and 
Serbian denationalization. After 50 years of oppression we 
hoped that under the new conditions of pluralism we would have 
the opportunity to state our rights clearly. However, this did 
not happen. We think that it is high time that Bulgaria took 
care of its children outside her borders. There will be nothing 
unusual in this, because all the countries in the world do it. 
  [Nikolova] Have you met any official Bulgarian 
representatives to discuss this issue? 
  [Ilijevski] Over the last six months I have had many useful 
contacts in Sofia. I have had talks with [National Assembly 
Chairman] Aleksandur Yordanov and with President Zhelev's 
advisers. I have also had meetings at the Agency for Bulgarians 
Abroad and many political party leaders. However, most of my 
meetings have been with journalists. Thus, the problems of the 
Bulgarians in Macedonia have been presented to the Bulgarian and 
world public. Unfortunately, official Bulgaria continues to keep 
silent. It is high time that Bulgaria announced its position on 
the so-called Macedonian issue. 
  [Nikolova] Our country was the first to recognize 
Macedonia's independence. Do you think that Sofia is afraid to 
declare openly its support for the Bulgarians in the former 
Yugoslav republic? 
  [Ilijevski] There is no reason to be afraid, but I think 
that the old understandings still prevail. Unfortunately, the 
good relations between Bulgaria and Macedonia are at the expense 
of the Bulgarians who live there. There used to exist an 
unwritten treaty between Sofia and Skopje that there are no 
Bulgarians in Macedonia. Good relations between the two 
countries could and can exist only if Bulgaria does not look 
after us. 
  I do not think that this is either good or moral. If I may 
use a metaphor, it means that the Bulgarians in Macedonia have a 
mother who is alive but does not look after them. Let me ask 
the following: If a mother does not think about her children 
across the border, how will it help those who live here? 
  [Nikolova] Bulgaria offered Macedonia its ports when Greece 
announced its trade blockade. How do you think the conflict 
with Greece will develop? 
  [Ilijevski] I cannot forecast anything, but I think that 
there could be a positive result. Both Greece and Macedonia 
could make concessions. However, it is a different matter as to 
whether Greece is right. Many states throughout the world have 
already denounced it, while its neighbors are keeping silent in 
an attempt to maintain good relations with it. 
  It is true that official Macedonia, led by Kiro Gligorov, 
defends Macedonism. However, this involves twisting historical 
facts and distorting the history of Bulgaria and Greece. In 
such a case it was normal on the part of the Greeks to react in 
such a sharp manner. 
  [Nikolova] How will the Yugocrisis develop and will there be 
a war in Macedonia? 
  [Ilijevski] I do not think that there will be war if there 
is no military intervention and the problems are peacefully 
resolved, unless we ourselves do something to ourselves. In 
order to avoid this, the Balkan states are called upon to be law 
abiding and democratic states and respect human rights. In this 
way international conflicts could be avoided.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bad Economic Situation"] </F>
  [Text] The economic system in Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] is not functioning 
completely, and the parts of it that do function are faced with 
conditions worse than last year's. These are the global 
evaluations of the Macedonian Chamber of Commerce, which is 
following the realization of the 1994 stabilization program of 
the government. The situation in certain segments, as for 
example in the monetary policy, is even worse than last year and 
threaten to prove disastrous for the economy. 
  The companies, besides on the Greek embargo and reduced 
foreign markets, also bitterly criticized the domestic factors 
smothering the realization of the stabilization program. They 
point out the low percentage of using of the available 
capacities, the heavy burden of public expenditures, the low 
accumulative capacity of the economy, and the unemployment. The 
January break of the planned 8 percent to even up to [passage 
indistinct] end of the year is realistic. Therefore, they 
appealed to the bankers not to introduce a rapid increase of the 
interest rates. The restrictive monetary policy threatens to 
grow into a real war between the banks and the companies, since 
it gives little opportunities for the weakened Macedonian 
economy. The companies claim the interest rates are not in the 
function of stabilizing and stimulating the production. 
  Additional problems are also the delayed privatization 
process, the too large exposure of the domestic market to 
liberalization, etc. In such conditions it is hard to expect 
that the economy will function property, and a co-operation 
between the proposer -- the Government and [passage indistinct].

<F P=106> [Article by Irene Miller: "Macedonia Does Not Want To Be a </F>
Victim"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- "We are not giving our companies away, we 
are selling them. And everybody can buy them, no matter whether 
he is a foreigner or a Macedonian." In a lecture at the 
Austrian Economic Chamber, Jane Miljovski, privatization 
minister of the Yugoslav successor republic Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], was looking for 
helpers on the difficult path into an economic future. 
  Currently, Macedonia is suffering from the UN sanctions 
against what remains of Yugoslavia and from the crumbling of 
Yugoslavia as a whole: In the past, 70 percent of Macedonian 
exports went to the other Yugoslav republics, 60 percent of that 
to Serbia; now deliveries to Serbia are prohibited by the UN 
sanctions. 
  Goods that are exported elsewhere can be brought to their 
destination only with great difficulties: The roads lead 
through the rump Yugoslavia, which is closed to transit, or 
though Greece, which has closed its borders to its small 
neighbor. With this, Athens wants to force Macedonia to change 
the name of its state. 
<H5>  Privatization Has Started </H5>
  Miljovski explains that the new privatization law has been 
in 
force just for three months and has not yet had a great effect. 
About 1,400 companies are to be transferred from "social" to 
private ownership. Generally, a buyer for 51 percent of the 
companies searched first. With this it is intended to make sure 
that the company is taken over by a responsible owner and is 
managed with an orientation toward profits and that there are no 
speculations. 
  In Skopje, it is known that the domestic savings assets 
cover 
only about 10 percent of the value of the companies. Therefore, 
the state wants to lend the owner 41 percent of the company's 
value for five years, if the new owner fulfills two conditions: 
He must create jobs and pay taxes. 
  Skopje is also aware of the fact that foreign investors are 
not particularly lining up to buy, because the infrastructure -- 
high rents, bad telephone lines, a lack of electricity, to give 
just a few examples -- is still a few steps away from European 
standards even though improvements are underway. 
  Foreign trading partners also complain that Slovenia can 
export self-imported goods to Macedonia practically without 
customs duties -- in contrast to that, the other countries have 
to overcome very high customs barriers. Miljovski explains that 
this is due to the UN request not to erect any trade barriers 
for the ex-Yugoslav area during the search for peace. The 
discrepancy will certainly be abolished soon, Miljvoski says.

  [Text] A two-day meeting of the foreign ministers of the 10 
countries of the Central European Initiative [CEI] ended in 
Trieste in northern Italy today with the adoption of the 
document on political and economic issues. 
  In the document the ministers welcomed the recent Washington 
agreement between the Croats and Muslims as a positive step 
toward achieving a global solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
ministers also welcomed the latest developments around Sarajevo 
and confirmed their support for the sovereignty, territorial 
integrity, and independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In the economic document, the ministers expressed 
satisfaction at the implementation of some approved projects but 
at the same time stressed that the CEI's economic consolidation 
needed more effective work by the individual working groups.

  [Excerpts] Foreign ministers of the Central European 
Initiative [CEI] member states ended their two-day meeting in 
the Italian city of Trieste today. Here is our special 
correspondent Klara Stejskalova with a summary of what happened 
at the conference. 
  [Stejskalova] [passage omitted] Czech Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec emphasized that the Czech Republic is interested in 
deepening cooperation in the area of migration and in 
contributing to the shaping of pan-European migration policy. 
[passage omitted] 
  More controversial was, as usual, the question of ethnic 
minorities, which was brought to a head mainly by the Hungarian 
side. In this connection, Slovak representative Jozef Prokes 
emphasized that the Council of Europe session in Vienna did not 
reach any agreement on ethnic minorities. He reminded of the 
absence of a comparative study of the position of Central 
European minorities, something that is needed for an overall 
solution to this problem. At the same time, he firmly refused 
to accept that this problem is specific to our region. 
  Josef Zieleniec stated his belief that the minority issue -- 
and other political problems -- should be dealt with by 
appropriate bodies, such as the Council of Europe. The CEI 
should rather concentrate on concrete economic cooperation.

  [Text] Trieste, March 5 (TANJUG) -- A two-day session of 
the foreign ministers of the countries of the so-called Central 
European Initiative ended on Saturday evening, after lending 
all-out support to the Washington agreement between the Bosnian 
Croats and Muslims and expressing hope that the Bosnian Serbs 
would join the "Bosnian Federation." 
  Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic and his Bosnian Muslim 
counterpart Irfan Ljubijankic informed the chief diplomats of 
Italy, Austria, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Slovak 
Republic, Slovenia and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
(FYROM) that the Croat-Muslim agreement was "open to the Serbs, 
too." 
  Representatives of the Bosnian Croats, Muslims and the 
Republic of Croatia signed in Washington on Tuesday, under 
strong pressure from the U.S. Administration, a preliminary 
agreement on a federation of the two peoples in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and a subsequent 
confederation with neighbouring Croatia. 
  The U.S. peace negotiator for the former Yugoslavia Thorvald 
Stoltenberg, who attended the session of the Central European 
Initiative, set out that there was no reason to believe that the 
Serbs were not ready for a peaceful solution, and underscored 
that no lasting solution was possible without the Serb side.

<F P=106> ["Open Letter by Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov in </F>
Connection With the Petition Signed by Officers of the Bulgarian 
Army, and Organized by Certain Members of the Rakovski Bulgarian 
Officer Legion"] 
  [Text] Democracy in the Armed Forces has its limits. 
Certain activists of the Rakovski Bulgarian Officer Legion 
crossed these limits. Already, on several occasions petitions 
were initiated and signed by officers of he Bulgarian Army, 
something that contradicts the Disciplinary Regulations of the 
Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria, Article 104, Chapter 
5, and the following paragraphs, according to which petitions, 
proposals, and complains can only have a personal character. 
Those actions contradict the basic postulates regarding 
relations between the Ministry of Defense and the Rakovski 
Officer Legion, according to which mutual activity must be based 
on the steady observance of the Constitution, the country's 
laws, the military charters, and the principle of 
one-man-command. 
  Those who seek an increase in the military budget through 
petitions and publishing opinions at this very difficult period 
for the country, speculate with the common interest of the 
military personnel, and push the Army toward destabilization and 
politicization. In their striving to protect their own 
interests the organizers and initiators of the petition are 
prepared to trigger a confrontation between the Army and 
society. As a minister of defense, I have only one choice in 
anything related to the military budget: To accommodate the 
Army within the budget adopted by the National Assembly through 
painful but prudent decisions. 
  With its actions, the leadership of the Rakovski Bulgarian 
Officer Legion inflicted a blow on the authority of the Legion, 
which as established in order to increase the status and 
prestige of the officers, rally the officer corps, and assert 
the Bulgarian Army's values and traditions. 
  There can be no instigation in the Bulgarian Army, and such 
a 
situation will not be tolerated. 
  Those who think that the Armed Forces of the Republic of 
Bulgaria could be directed through petitions from the bottom to 
the top are deceiving themselves.

  [Excerpts] Promotion, graduation, and oath-taking 
ceremonies for new officers and the start of school activity at 
the Defense Academy of the Republic of Albania were held in one 
of the halls of the Military Academy this morning. [passage 
omitted] 
  Prime Minister Meksi conveyed the greetings of Sali Berisha, 
president of the Republic and commander general, to those 
present. He wished them success in their new, sacred task of 
defending the country. Among other things, Meksi said: 
  [Begin Meksi recording] Today is a remarkable day for you 
and the Army. Your promotion and graduation, as well the start 
of the school process in the Defense Academy, which is 
completely reformed and restructured, constitute an important 
achievement. All this is being held at a historic moment of 
special importance, at a time when real democracy is being 
consolidated in our country and when, on the international 
level, Albania's position has been improved and recognized 
through its numerous education activities in many important 
international institutions. 
  Consequently, even our Army, with its reformation, has 
already broken the framework of long isolation by cooperating 
with many armies of Western and other democratic countries, thus 
aiming to be converted into a qualitative, modern, and 
contemporary army. These prospects become more certain due to 
the approach to NATO as well as the signing of the Partnership 
for Peace initiative, which will naturally integrate Albania 
into the bosom of the NATO alliance. However, the road to 
membership passes through the difficult but indispensable road 
of efficiency, increased military and contemporary knowledge, 
high discipline, and a very high state of alertness. [end

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on first day of trial of Socialist </F>
Party Chairman Fatos Nano in Tirana on 5 March: "The Albanians 
Again Say No to Violations of Human Rights and Freedoms, 
Manipulation, and Political Persecution; The State Is Determined 
To See Fatos Nano Sentenced and in Prison; Fatos Nano Accuses, 
Prosecutors Qeleshi and Gjokutaj Fall Silent and Sweat"] 
  [Text] Because of the situation created in Tirana the day 
before yesterday [4 March], with its associated tension, panic, 
anxiety, and terror in the hearts of those in power, the Tirana 
Court on Durres Street, before the start of the trial of Fatos 
Nano, Socialist Party [PS] chairman and parliamentary deputy, 
was surrounded by hundreds of uniformed policemen, dozens of 
members of the special rapid deployment forces, and high-level 
officers from the Public Order Ministry armed with shields, blue 
helmets, bulletproof vests, rubber truncheons, Kalashnikov 
rifles, and of course their whistles and handcuffs. This was 
all to guarantee what President Berisha promised: openness, 
judicial independence, and the enforcement of legal standards 
and procedures in the trial of the opposition leader. 
  According to announcements, the trial was to take place in 
open court but with admission by invitation issued by the Tirana 
Court because of the size of the hall. Shaqir Vukaj, deputy 
chairman of the Albanian parliament, was not allowed entry to 
the courtroom to follow the proceedings. Meanwhile, dozens of 
policemen who were not on escort duty were present in the court. 
  Judge Agim Bendo opened the session at 0900. The case's 
prosecutors were Arben Qeleshi and that strange little fellow 
Genc Gjokutaj. Facing them in the dock were opposition leader 
Fatos Nano, Sokrat Plaka, Hasan Allkja, and Robert Gjini. After 
presenting the bench of judges to the court, Mr. Bendo turned to 
the defendants and asked whether they recognized the court. 
Fatos Nano then read the statement we publish under the title, 
"Even Though You Do Not Have the Civil Courage to Face Up to Us, 
I Agree To Stand Before You, Because the Law Stands Between Us." 
Defense counsel Perparim Sanxhaku then spoke, making a detailed 
summary based on individual articles and laws of the Penal Code, 
describing all the violations of procedure committed from PS 
Chairman Fatos Nano's arrest to his imprisonment and the 
rejection as inadmissible of the submissions of Fatos Nano and 
his lawyers. The lawyers of the other defendants also protests 
procedural violations. The lawyer Sanxhaku called for the court 
to threat Nano's case separately from those of the other 
defendants, to return the files to the prosecutor, and to 
commute Nano's arrest. The other defendants' lawyers made the 
same requests on behalf of their clients. Prosecutor Gjokutaj 
then asked for one hour to reply to the lawyer's requests. 
After one hour he replied in his own way; i.e., he gave no 
reply. The bench then withdrew to decide on the lawyers' 
requests. At 1500, Judge Bendo seemed to repeat Prosecutor 
Gjukotaj's reply. He rejected the lawyers' requests, with the 
exception of commuting Sokrat Plaka's arrest. After this 
decision, Deputy Fatos Nano stated that he was breaking all 
relations with the bench. Lawyer Tirana supported and explained 
Mr. Nano's legal decision and asked for the court to remove Mr. 
Nano and his two lawyers from the court. Mr. Bendo considered 
this an unreasonable attitude on the part of the lawyers, and 
gave them 10 minutes to reconsider. However, it seems that 
these 10 minutes were less for the lawyers to reconsider than 
for Mr. Bendo himself. Mr. Bendo opened the session, asking 
Prosecutor Qeleshi to read the charge. For 25 minutes, Qeleshi 
reread for the umpteenth time the State Control Commission's 
report published by Blerim Cela. After this, Mr. Bendo asked 
the accused whether they accepted the charges. Opposition 
leader Fatos Nano repeated his stand in his statement, "I Have 
Broken All Relations With the Court." Lawyer Sanxahku reminded 
Mr. Bendo of the need for 10 minutes' break, but the latter 
interrupted him, saying that the court's decision could not be 
opposed at this moment. The defendants did not accept the 
charges. Mr. Bendo closed the session, to reopen it at 1000 
today with the questioning of opposition leader Fatos Nano. 

<H5>    Courtroom Incidents </H5>
  Prosecutor Genc Gjokutaj bellowed instead of giving a reply 
to charges of violations of procedure by the Prosecutor's Office 
during the investigation of the Nano affair. 
  From the manner in which he read, it was clear he was not 
reading his own writing. 
  Meanwhile, in contrast to his junior colleague Gjokutaj, 
Chief Prosecutor Arben Qeleshi, whom Fatos Nano called a puppet 
prosecutor required by the state solely to sign arrest warrants, 
showed himself able to read fluently a typed charged sheet that 
bore the signature of his deputy Dervishi at the end. 
  The presiding judge Agim Bendo tried to maintain the 
seriousness of the court, and succeeded when he was reminded of 
the Arsidi trial and his trip to Paris with Ilir Hoti, who is 
now in prison. At this moment, cameras flashed in the courtoom 
to preserve on celluloid the expression of his face. 
  At the end of the first session, Mr. Bendo broke a taboo of 
trials under the dictatorship by allowing the defendants to meet 
those of their relations who were in the courtroom. 
  Kurt Kola, chairman of the Association of Former Political 
Prisoners and Victims of Persecution, was the most attentive 
person in the hall. Who knows what ideas swirled through the 
mind of this martyr of democracy as he heard the denunciations 
of the violations of the human rights to which he and his 
association are so attached, exceeding in their dedication even 
the Meksi Government and the former Communist President Sali 
Berisha. Let us remember how Kola once let off his revolver in 
Kavaje as a sign of understanding and conciliation among 
Albanians and then wiped the barrel before thrusting it back in 
his belt. 
<H3>  Fatos Nano Addresses the Bench: "Even Though You Do Not 
Have the Civil Courage To Face Up to Us, I Agree To Stand Before 
You, Because the Law Stands Between Us" </H3>
  Your honor, this is a political trial, because it has been 
seriously prejudiced by the attitudes, statements, and public 
and private activities of persons associated or not with the 
judicial process, from the head of state, the chairman of the 
People's Assembly, the chairman of the ruling Democratic Party, 
the chairman of the Association of Former Political Prisoners 
and Victims of Persecution,, the president of the Appeal Court, 
etc., down to the most recent chairman of the Democratic Party 
Youth Forum. 
  Of course, at the appropriate time, I will ask for their 
well- documented public pressure on the judiciary to be taken as 
evidence of the political character of the trial, and will call 
on these persons, together with their "minion," as witnesses to 
this and to other private acts. 
  Because of these circumstances, and because I do not 
identify 
justice with individual names, I am indifferent to the selection 
and composition of your bench. This indifference extends to 
yourself as presiding judge, despite the substantial and strong 
evidence that compromises your position as an independent judge 
such as the law demands. I will mention here only one piece of 
evidence. The state is using against you "the Paris Charter," 
by which I mean not the well-known Paris Charter on democratic 
principles recognized throughout the world, but the one 
connected with the "Arsidi affair," and your involvement in this 
scandal, in tandem with Hoti, on the side of citizen Berisha. 
The latter, in his capacity as president and chairman of the 
Supreme Coucil of Justice, quashed your last moral stand when 
you submitted your resignation to this Council, of which you are 
still a member. The tandem has now become a quartet, and, as on 
other occasions, you are coming to this trial after meetings 
last Monday [1 Mar] and between 0900 and 1300 yesterday with 
President Berisha, at which P. Martini, A. Qeleshi, and F. 
Dervishi were also present, in Villa Number Four near the Palace 
of Brigades, where the Supreme Council of Justice now meets to 
discuss the "Nano affair" and many others. Thus, you are 
prisoners in a villa-prison, while we are free, as you also see 
from the press. 
  In conclusion, even though you do not have the civil courage 
to face up to us, I agree to stand before you, because the law 
stands between us. 
  Thank you. 
  Fatos Nano, PS chairman, People's Assembly deputy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu by Jan Skoda </F>
in Bratislava on 3 March: "We Will Not Discuss Borders"] 
  [Text] Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu arrived in 
Bratislava yesterday for a one-day working visit to Slovakia. 
He met in Bratislava with the republic's most senior 
constitutional representatives -- Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar 
and Ivan Gasparovic, chairman of the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic -- and he was received by Slovak President 
Michal Kovac. During his visit, the Romanian prime minister 
granted our daily an exclusive interview. 
  [Skoda] Could you compare the standard of Romania's 
relations with Slovakia and with the other Visegrad Group 
countries? Are they better or do they lag behind in any respect? 
  [Vacaroiu] We have traditionally good relations with 
Slovakia. A general agreement on friendship and cooperation 
between Romania and Slovakia and a whole series of important 
agreements -- for example, a memorandum on whose basis an 
agreement on creating a free trade zone will be drafted -- have 
come into force. We have signed an agreement on preventing dual 
taxation and on protecting investments and payments as well as 
other agreements concerning culture and tourism. A consular 
agreement is under preparation. The important thing is that we 
have formed a basis for intensifying cooperation between our 
business entities. So, the dynamism of our bilateral relations 
is very good on all levels. 
  [Skoda] Our countries are coordinating their foreign policy 
and their policy toward the ethnic minorities within the 
framework of the Romanian-Slovak agreement on friendship and 
cooperation. Some political forces in neighboring Hungary have 
described the signing of this agreement as "a step oriented 
against the interests of Hungary." How do you now assess this 
coordination? 
  [Vacaroiu] We are especially concerned about harmonizing 
certain steps of common interest. Dealing with the issue of the 
Hungarian minority in Romania, however, is our internal affair. 
We are merely interested in ensuring that all the citizens of 
our states have the same rights and responsibilities, but not 
privileges. Our laws guarantee them rights. Certain circles in 
Hungary and in our country are coming up with demands that are 
unacceptable to us as a sovereign state. For example, we will 
not discuss borders; otherwise, this could lead to 
destabilization. The ethnic minorities -- and not only the 
Hungarians -- enjoy the same rights as other citizens, and they 
are not discriminated against thanks to the principles by which 
we are governed. In any case, in resolving these issues, it is 
essential to follow a correct path. 
  [Skoda] In essence, our two countries are pursuing the same 
aims in foreign policy -- to join the North Atlantic pact and to 
become integrated as fast as possible into West European 
economic structures. How is Romania approaching the Partnership 
for Peace? Have you already drafted a specific program for 
Romania's involvement in NATO's military maneuvers and in the UN 
"peace-keeping" operations in Europe? 
  [Vacaroiu] At the moment, we are going through the first, 
transition stage of the economy's radical transformation and of 
establishing a law-governed state. Therefore, in foreign policy 
we are striving to secure stability and peace in our region. 
For this reason, we have signed the Partnership for Peace, and 
were the first country to do so. Adapting to the structures of 
the NATO armies is proceeding concurrently with the reform of 
the Romanian Army. Of course, we envisage that we will also 
take part in some NATO exercises and UN peace-keeping 
operations. However, this will also depend a great deal on the 
financial resources.... 
  [Skoda] In connection with recent developments in the 
Balkans and the increased diplomatic activity by Moscow to bring 
about peace in Bosnia, what is your assessment of the signing of 
an agreement on the creation of a Muslim-Croatian Confederation? 
  [Vacaroiu] Romania has good relations with all the republics 
of the former Yugoslavia. We believe, however, that the 
involvement of all three sides in the Bosnian conflict is 
necessary to bring about a lasting peace. Greater involvement 
by the international community is essential in order for it to 
supervise for a certain period the outcome of the peace process .

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 7 March carries within 
its regular 30-minute newscast several reports on the combat 
situation in the republic: 
  According to Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Cermic, "instead 
of a cease-fire arranged to exchange the dead bodies of the 
soldiers of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and those of the Serbian 
aggressor, Maglaj is being subjected to artillery fire. After 
unsuccessful attacks on [words indistinct], the attacks were 
directed exclusively on civilian targets. Some 70 57-mm shells 
were fired from Bofors, while tanks are opening intermittent 
fire from [name indistinct]. One civilian was wounded." 
  Correspondent Mirudin Aldobasic reports from the 7th South 
Operations Group that "the aggressor early this morning suddenly 
shelled with heavy artillery Kalosevici and the lines of defense 
of the 207th Brcko Brigade and [word indistinct]. The shelling 
is continuing, although infantry attacks have been successfully 
repelled." Aldobasic also says that "the aggressor is 
constantly" attacking defense lines in the Teslic region with 
heavy arms. 
  Reporting on the shelling of Bihac, correspondent Mirza 
Sadikovic says that "one shell alone killed three and wounded 
five persons while they were performing their duties and jobs. 
Regarding the new material damage, no one is talking about it 
any longer. The final number of the victims of today's shelling 
is still unfortunately unknown, considering that the killing 
from the hills around Bihac is still going on. In addition to 
Bihac, Cazin and the surrounding area are also being targeted 
with howitzers and mortars." 
  Zavidovici correspondent Viktor Boban reports that "the 
chetniks this afternoon launched attacks on the defense lines in 
several sectors." He also says that the "defenders are fiercely 
responding, not allowing the aggressor to advance even a 
millimeter." 
  Boban concludes his report by saying that three civilians 
have been killed.

  [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman received Fikret 
Abdic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, in the 
presidential palace in Zagreb today. The meeting was also 
attended by Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister. They discussed the details of the Washington 
agreement and the course of the Vienna negotiations conducted by 
the transition committee for the preparation of a final 
agreement between Croats and Bosnian Muslims on entering a 
federation as two equal and constituent nations and on setting 
up a confederal union with the Republic of Croatia. 
  It was said during the talks that the Vienna negotiations 
are 
expected to end by 15 March, when the final agreement should be 
signed. President Tudjman stressed that the agreement is not 
directed against the third side, but that the Bosnian Serbs are 
invited to join the negotiations. 
  Lending his support to the Washington agreement, Abdic 
stressed that he has always advocated close cooperation between 
the Croat and Muslim nations, and that he opposed the elements 
in the Muslim leadership which fomented Croat-Muslim clashes. 
Abdic particularly stressed the importance of President 
Tudjman's efforts to involve the Serb side in the negotiations 
in order to restore peace.

  [Text] There are tones in Russian foreign policy that are 
beginning to cause concern. The Czech Republic wants to enjoy a 
good relationship with Moscow, but "Russia cannot decide on our 
behalf which international organizations we can or cannot join." 
  The statement was made by Czech President Vaclav Havel, who 
was speaking at a news conference in Rome on the Moscow veto on 
any Central and East European country joining NATO. Havel then 
said that the West "had been too slow" in understanding the 
problems of East Europe. Earlier, the Czech president had been 
received by the pope and by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.

<F P=106> ["Regular" Friday interview with Prime Minister Vladimir </F>
Meciar by correspondent Martin Bartisek; place and date not 
given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Bartisek] The work aimed at gaining the 
necessary 350,000 signatures required to call a referendum on 
early elections ended last week. It appears that more 
signatures than required have been obtained and that all of the 
documents still have to be checked. But time is seemingly 
against this endeavor. 
  Prime Minister, you have proposed 25-26 June as the date of 
the election. But this means that the elections will have to be 
officially called on 2 April at the latest. With regard to the 
demanding nature of the measures that will have to be 
implemented, this date appears to be virtually unrealistic. Do 
you still think that elections can take place on this date? 
  [Meciar] Yes, I do. First, Mr. President does not have to 
wait the whole 30 days. He could speed up his decision. 
Equally, there is always a chance that the political entities 
represented in the National Council [of the Slovak Republic] 
might reach an agreement on holding elections earlier. After 
all, opposition parties have been calling for early elections 
the entire year, and now, when they have a chance, they scream 
that they are not ready. 
  There are two criteria that should be considered. The basic 
criterion is what is the interest of the state. The interest of 
the state is to resolve this parliamentary crisis as soon as 
possible because the economic and social effect of this crisis 
on citizens and on the state is very serious. If we consider 
the interest of the state to be a priority issue, nobody should 
hesitate as to whether elections should or should not be held in 
June. If, on the other hand, we take into consideration the 
interests of political parties, the elections will take place as 
late as possible. 
  We would act irresponsibly toward our state if we were to 
subordinate the interests of the state to people like Mr. 
Knazko, the chairman of the Alliance of Democrats, Mr. Cernak, 
the chairman of the national democratic faction in the Slovak 
National Party, and former Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac 
until they have built up their parties. We would act 
irresponsibly if we were to let the economy and the social 
sphere be tossed around in uncertainty, if we let the name of 
our state be questioned abroad. Here we can see a line dividing 
us from those who apply their past attitude toward the state to 
current conditions. 
  No matter what the election result, the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia will have to lend its support to the 
interests of the state and to give utmost priority to this 
interest, while the movement's election results and interests 
should take second place. Others should do the same thing, and 
this would then clarify the election date issue. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Bartisek] I do not think we have reached any significant 
positive turning point since our last interview, when we agreed 
that the internal political crisis had deepened in a certain 
way. The failure to fill two ministerial posts in your Cabinet 
continues to be alarming and, for the present Slovakia--I will 
put this openly--it is to a certain degree disadvantageous. You 
have said that somebody who is good enough to be a deputy prime 
minister is good enough to be entrusted with the post of a 
foreign minister. Can you clarify your statement a little? 
  [Meciar] To put it clearly, I would be at fault if my 
failure 
to put forward proposals resulted in not having ministerial 
posts filled. However, in fact, we have to share responsibility 
also with the person who failed to accept my proposals, without 
giving any reason for doing so. 
  The fact that President Michal Kovac expressed a lack of 
confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Jozef Prokes, supporter of 
European integration, whom he had considered acceptable [as a 
deputy prime minister] and whom he refuses now to consider 
acceptable as a foreign minister, is a matter of political and 
ethical dimension. It is not restricted to a legal 
dimension--the field where the law does not oblige the president 
to give any reasons for his actions. 
  The selection of a new foreign minister is now being 
discussed in our talks with other political subjects. The issue 
is whether, in the period until the elections, the Cabinet 
should be joined by members of other parties. Talks are under 
way. We should be clear about the fundamental stance on 7 March. 
Once we are clear about our stance, we can take further 
decisions to solve this burning problem. 
  I am alarmed by the fact that, after having a crisis 
introduced in the parliament, the failure to meet each other 
halfway on personnel issues is also being introduced in the 
Cabinet. However, we will not allow this to have an impact on 
the way the Cabinet functions. This will not happen. The Cabinet 
functions and works as responsibly as possible. 
  [Bartisek] New candidates should emerge following coalition 
talks between the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the 
Slovak National Party. [passage omitted] 
  [Meciar] I would wait before drawing any conclusions. 
There is no doubt that, as far as the privatization post is 
concerned, the candidate will be generally acceptable. As far 
as foreign affairs are concerned, I will take into account not 
only the coalition talks between the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia and the Slovak National Party because one or two other 
partners are being considered, too. Perhaps the Foreign Affairs 
Ministry will be the post where we reach an agreement to widen 
[the range of the Cabinet]. [passage omitted] 
  [Bartisek] Coexistence Chairman Mikulas Duray made a rather 
important statement addressed to Slovak political parties when 
he said: Some government coalition statements have created a 
political configuration that might be described as representing 
fascism with a human face. 
  This image literally creates fear. Therefore, I would ask 
you 
for clarification coming from you as the coalition 
representative. 
  [Meciar] Mr. Duray should own up to responsibility for his 
statements. 
  He has already called the government fascist. This is 
nothing 
new in his vocabulary. He repeats such statements. Following 
the first accusation, the authorities began criminal 
proceedings, but, because he is a deputy of the [former 
Czechoslovak] Federal Assembly, it is not clear who has the 
power to strip him of parliamentary immunity. If this is done 
by the Slovak National Council, it would mean that by doing so 
they accept all deputies of the Federal Assembly as full members 
of the representative body. This is why the affair came to a 
standstill and they have asked the Constitutional Court for 
interpretation. This is preventing the bodies that are 
responsible for dealing with such statements and that are 
drawing conclusions regarding personal responsibility from 
concluding the matter. 
  Let me present some facts. No one can doubt the fact that 
the Slovak Republic has been recognized abroad. The signing of 
the association agreement means the recognition of the Slovak 
Republic's democratic regime. The fact that we have gained 
access to the Council of Europe means recognition of our 
democratic regime. We have joined Partnership for 
Peace--without the recognition of a democratic regime there is 
no partnership. 
  We have to stop this self-damaging, self-degrading, and 
self-destructing carried out by Slovak Republic citizens, 
regardless of their nationality. Elections have to take place, 
among other reasons, to give our citizens a chance to tell those 
who are engaged in this self-destruction, who are tearing our 
society apart: We have had enough of you; we do not want you 
anymore; go somewhere else--do not do these things from inside 
the parliament. This is why I think that a purification through 
elections will also help regarding this aspect. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] Zamosc, 7 Mar--Today Colonel Andrzej Stasiak, 
head of the Provincial Civil Defense Inspectorate, said that an 
agreement has been signed in Zamosc on border cooperation 
between the civil defense services in Zamosc province and Volyn 
Oblast in Ukraine. 
  Using this opportunity, the Ukrainian side, represented by 
Anatoliy Arkhipov, head of the Civil Defense Headquarters in 
Volyn Oblast, and Mykola Tarasenko, head of the defense and 
extraordinary situations department, spoke for the first time 
about the border enterprises that have toxic industrial products 
and the nuclear power station in Rovno. The representatives of 
Zamosc province and Volyn Oblast decided that enterprises on 
both sides of the border no longer post any threats. 
  The agreement signed today anticipates the creation of 
information and warning systems in case of extraordinary 
dangers. Among other things, it envisages cooperation in the 
event of a breakdown at nuclear power stations, radioactive 
contamination, and natural disasters that put human lives in 
danger, and in eliminating the consequences of disasters. 
[passage omitted] A similar agreement with civil defense 
services in Lvov district is planned.

  [Text] Esteemed listeners, governmental spokesman Raycho 
Raykov is on the telephone to provide us with details on Prime 
Minister Berov's health condition: 
  [Raykov] Good day to you and the listeners. A short while 
ago I had a telephone conversation with Professor Petrov, head 
of the Military Medical Academy, who informed me that after a 
thorough checkup and examination today at 0800, the medical team 
of the Military-Medical Academy's Lozenets Hospital in Sofia 
established that the condition of Professor Lyuben Berov, who 
suffered a heart attack yesterday, is slowly stabilizing. The 
basic symptoms of the heart attack have been overcome, and the 
patient is in good spirits. 
  There will be a news conference with the Lozenets Hospital 
medical team at the Governmental Press Center at 1400 today 
regarding the health condition of Prof. Lyuben Berov. 
  With your permission, I would like to add something. I want 
to officially deny the nonsense -- to put it mildly -- published 
in some of today's newspapers regarding the prime minister's 
condition. I would like to invite correspondents to the news 
conference to learn about the prime minister's condition. 
Apparently some of them would like the prime minister to be in 
much worse condition than he already is. 
  One more thing: No one has been fired at the Council of 
Ministers. A newspaper today even claimed that Georgi Nedev, 
the chief of the Prime Minister's Office, was fired yesterday. 
I want to deny this report. Nothing similar has happened, and 
I hope nothing will happen because the government is functioning 
normally. The prime minister's scheduled meetings with 
representatives of various Bulgarian and foreign institutions 
will be carried out by his deputies. As you know, the prime 
minister yesterday signed an order according to which, during 
his sick leave, he will be replaced by Deputy Prime Minister 
Evgeni Matinchev. Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Editorial report: "Petition of Legion's `Agitators' Stirs </F>
Defense Ministry"] 
  [Text] The petition of the Rakovski Bulgarian Officer 
Legion, regarding the inadequacy of the military budget adopted 
by the National Assembly one week ago, prompted meetings and 
discussions at the Ministry of Defense. 
  Minister Valentin Mikhaylov sharply reacted to the petition 
and in a 28 February letter to the initiators he stressed that 
the legion's activists have crossed the limits of democracy, and 
that agitators will not be tolerated in the Army. On the same 
day the president discussed the situation in the Army with his 
military advisers. 
  On 1 and 2 March the leadership of the Ministry of Defense 
had a working meeting with commanders and officers from the 1st, 
2d, and 3d Armies, the Press Center of the Ministry of Defense 
announced on 2 March. Later, at a "special meeting," the 
ministry's leadership and the General Staff discussed the issues 
posed at the meeting related to the structural reform in the 
Army, the officers' wages and housing conditions, and the 
everyday life of the soldiers. 
  The same issues have been repeatedly posed in the past by 
the 
Rakovski Legion which, in recent weeks, energetically insisted 
on adopting the 37-billion-leva military budget requested by the 
General Staff. The parliament voted only 12 billion leva for 
defense needs. 
  Despite the limited budget possibilities, the defense 
minister ordered that proposals be prepared on resolving the 
most acute problems. 
  The Press Center of the Ministry of Defense noted that 
"violations of the military regulations and discipline on the 
part of certain officers," were discussed at the meeting. 
However, the written announcement does not indicate whether the 
petition's initiators will be punished.

<F P=106> [Georgi Asyov commentary: "Divorce Continues"] </F>
  [Text] Skirmishes between extremists and pragmatists, and 
between phantom leaders of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] 
and its parliamentary faction, continued at the 1 March meeting 
of the SDS National Coordinating Council. It is well-known that 
a divorce is inevitable; the question is what side will get most 
of the inheritance -- the property and constituency of the SDS. 
  At the present stage of the divorce proceedings it appears 
that Filip Dimitrov and other leaders affiliated with him have 
the upper hand. They will probably succeed in establishing the 
blue [SDS] party, which many people have wanted for a long time. 
It is precisely this side to the divorce that is pressing for 
an extraordinary national conference, because they know that the 
delegates from the local branches will demand new elections, 
hoping to become parliament members. 
  Naturally, this variant does not excite the Democratic and 
Radical-Democratic Parties. The result will probably be an even 
greater emancipation of the SDS parliamentary faction vis-a-vis 
the SDS National Coordinating Council, which claims to lead it. 
This is the reason that the Radical-Democratic Party launched 
the idea of holding a "national meeting," rather than a 
conference. Such a meeting will be attended by elected 
officials (mostly National Assembly members and mayors, in other 
words, people who are not in a hurry to part with their 
mandates). 
  Against this background it appears that the talks proposed 
by 
the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] would be impossible 
or at least, certainly futile. On the other hand, one could not 
exclude the possibility of "separate" agreements between the DPS 
and certain more moderate SDS leaders and parties.

<F P=106> [Valeriya Mikhaylova report: "Konstantin Trenchev Closes </F>
PODKREPA Daily"] 
  [Text] The Executive Council of the Podkrepa Labor 
Confederation adopted a decision on "temporarily" stopping the 
publication of the PODKREPA daily as of 2 March. The decision 
was explained by the trade union's activity related to 
restructuring its information-publishing activity. 
  An announcement of the Podkrepa Labor Confederation's Press 
Center indicates that the Executive Council has declared a 
partial liquidation of the PODKREPA daily as a separate 
department of the confederation. The effective date is 2 March 
1994. 
  The decision on the newspaper's going into liquidation was 
adopted against the background of the conflicts that developed 
between the newspaper's editorial board and the leadership of 
the Podkrepa Labor Confederation. More than one month ago Dr. 
Trenchev openly expressed his dissatisfaction with the 
information published by the newspaper. Margarita Vurbanova, 
PODKREPA's chief editor, was fired. PODKREPA's journalists 
accused the confederation of refusing to pay their wages and 
royalties. Informed sources claim that the newspaper will begin 
to appear in a new format, and that it will be financed by 
powerful economic groups.

<F P=106> ["G.H."-initialed report: "Domestic Stability, Incalculable </F>
Factors in Foreign Policy"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 2 March -- In reply to a question about 
whether he will still be head of the government after the May 
parliamentary elections, Hungarian Prime Minister Boross said 
that he looked ahead to June with "moderate or cheerful 
optimism." "These will be the second free elections, it will be 
possible to make more accurate predictions when the fourth 
elections take place. However, the latest data indicates that 
an important part of the population understands our efforts and 
recognizes what we have done within the country and in bringing 
Hungary closer to Europe," said Boross, the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum's leading candidate, confidently. He ruled out coalitions 
with the Socialist Party, the Alliance of Free Democrats under 
its present leadership, the "Hungarian Life and Justice Party," 
and the "Independent Smallholders Party. Boross has thus made 
it clear that he does not want to have anything to do 
politically with the right-wing extremists Csurka and Torgyan, 
who lead the last two of the above parties and were formerly 
politicians in the current coalition government: "Their 
rhetoric and mentality is not compatible with the center-right 
direction that we consider acceptable, also acceptable from the 
viewpoint of the interests of our European efforts." 
  Speaking to this newspaper, the Hungarian prime minister 
also 
noted that Hungary was "potentially in a very dangerous 
geopolitical position." Five new states had been created on its 
borders, war is being waged in Hungary's vicinity, and there is 
a possibility that there might be another wave of refugees. 
That makes the domestic stability that the government has 
achieved all the more noteworthy. So, what is the significance 
of the skinheads, who have also created much commotion in 
Hungary? "In the past, skinheads were a relatively infrequent 
phenomenon in our country, and now there are only isolated 
incidents. However, we must implement one or two measures to 
dissolve these childish gangs. In Hungary, the phenomenon plays 
a smaller role than in most Europe states." 
  Regarding the emergence of extreme right-wing groupings that 
draw on the legacy of Arrow Cross leader Szalasi, who formed a 
Quisling regime in 1944 during the German occupation, the prime 
minister said: "If the supporters are very old people, then I 
feel sorry for them, if they are young people, then I cannot 
understand them. Szalasi was a traitor to the fatherland and has 
no place in Hungarian history." Recently, a man returned to 
Hungary from abroad and formed a group with a good 30 members. 
"Currently, the prosecution service is dealing with them; they 
are more of an irritation than a danger. There is nothing to 
indicate that they are spreading to the provinces." This kind 
of extremism has no support in Hungary and there is also no real 
left-wing danger. 
  Is Hungary, disappointed about the distance that the West is 
maintaining -- the "Partnership for Peace" instead of membership 
of MATO, associate membership of the European Union rather than 
full membership? "Hungary has really been regularly 
disappointed by the West since 1526. This stems from its 
difficult position and in part from its realistic and in part 
unrealistic expectations," conceded Boross. In 1989, in view of 
the opening up of borders and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact 
(which Hungary initiated), Hungary had great expectations, but 
two years later, one had to recognize reality "especially, that 
moving closer to the economic and security alliances, to that 
which offers real security, requires time." 
  The Hungarian head of government attracted international 
attention when, shortly after the announcement of the NATO 
ultimatum to end the siege of Sarajevo, he said that should the 
sanction be applied, then Hungarian airspace would not be 
available for AWACs flights. The background to that statement, 
which could be viewed as a political mistake and as indicating a 
new direction in Hungarian security in view of NATO's 
disappointing overall conduct and Russia's involvement in the 
former Yugoslavia, was explained by Boross as follows: "Hungary 
is a neighbor of Yugoslavia (he constantly used that term for 
the Belgrade republic) and one can expect to remain so for 
hundreds of years. There are 500,000 Hungarians living on the 
territory of Yugoslavia and they live in a region where there is 
no international control. In addition, Hungary is interested in 
the Danube shipping route, the 'Adria' oil pipeline, and, not 
least, in putting at ease the Hungarians in Vojvodina, of whom 
100,000 have already left their homes." He added that Hungary 
was not a member of NATO "and thus had no clear guarantees for 
its security, even if it were to receive such guarantees under 
certain circumstances in a conflict situation." The government 
is seeking to ensure its security and the interests of the 
Hungarian minority by maintaining good-neighborly relations, 
including contacts between military leaderships. This has led 
to the Hungarian stance of strictly adhering to the UN and UN 
Security Council resolutions and participating in the 
implementation of the embargo and the ban on flights. "However, 
the direct bombardment of ground targets does worry us." In 
connection with Boross' 1-day visit to Bonn, Hungarian diplomats 
said that the Hungarian Government was bound by a parliamentary 
resolution that only permits the use of Hungarian airspace for 
overseeing airspace and nothing else. 
  Russia's involvement in a region that it was forced out of 
by 
Tito in 1948 has also affected Hungary. There is power vacuum 
in the region and that whets appetites. The head of the 
Hungarian Government stated that Hungary, which is smaller than 
Bavaria, wants to convince Russia that dynamic relations and 
extensive commerce are advantageous (Hungary exports goods worth 
over $3 billion to Russia) and that Moscow can have no interests 
that are directed against Hungary. It is not the first time in 
Hungary's history that the country has clearly oriented itself 
to the West, while, at the same time, negotiating with all 
influential powers. In a speech delivered at the headquarters 
of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, Boross said: "We want 
security as quickly as possible, at the present time we, miss 
it."
