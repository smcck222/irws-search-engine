<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of </F>
Young Democrats, by Dezso Pinter; place and date not given: "We 
Are Facing the Citizens With A Good Conscience"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Orban] I am convinced that 
only a calm force that acts rationally and is capable of 
cooperating with the two other political camps, a political 
force really standing at the center of the political arena, can 
face the current tasks. In the difficult years to come, only 
such a force will be able to guarantee a compromise between the 
various interests and, subsequently, social peace. Unless a 
liberal center government leads the country after 1994, I really 
fear that neither of the forces at the right or at the left of 
the political arena will recoil from making use of all the 
available means to topple the other's government. And this will 
hurt the entire country. 
  I find it particularly dangerous that, in the case of such a 
political polarization, the basis of the bourgeois center could 
also slowly disintegrate, because a bourgeois middle class needs 
peace. If this center force disappears and if everyone has to 
belong to some camp in order to assert his interests, then we 
can give up our hopes of a bourgeois Hungary. 
  [Pinter] In your opinion, does the concept of bourgeois 
center originate from the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] 
exclusively? 
  [Orban] The process that led to the signing of an agreement 
between the Fidesz and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] 
and later between the other two liberal parties started at our 
pressure. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] Do you exclude the existence of liberal political 
parties that want to cooperation between liberals and leftists 
in principle? 
  [Orban] Of course, there are leftist liberal forces, and no 
one should be ashamed of this, because the social-liberal trend 
is present in many areas in the world. However, for such a 
policy in Hungary today, we lack one of the the major 
conditions, namely a genuine and strong social democratic party 
with which the liberals could easily agree. As for us, in our 
policy, we would like to assert the idea that the liberal 
thought always failed on two issues that are still timely today; 
one of them is the national issue, to which the liberals have 
failed to give an efficient answer since the beginning of this 
century and have left this issue to the right-wing and often 
extremist forces. We know well what tragedies came in the wake 
of all this. Certain circles of the current government 
coalition followed this tradition when they called us a force 
"insensitive to vital national questions" and tried to make 
people believe that liberalism was an article of mass 
consumption brought from abroad. The Fidesz has faced this 
challenge in the past three years. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] Could the elections in Hungary lead to results in 
the wake of which you revised your position about the 
undesirable aspect of a social liberal coalition? Gabor Fodor 
left the Fidesz and, as "second" on the national list of the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], he said that a government 
coalition based on the liberal force and the center would be the 
most balanced one, and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and 
a conservative party, perhaps the Christian Democratic People's 
Party might also have a place in such a coalition. Is it 
possible to form a real political agreement? 
  [Orban] I consider Gabor Fodor to be a full SZDSZ 
politician. Our personal relations cannot affect the cooperation 
between liberals. However, with a more clever policy, we could 
have postponed this issue until after the elections. This 
change of parties will hurt the SZDSZ, at least to the same 
extent it hurt the Fidesz. I fear that there will be no winner 
in this competition, and all of us will only lose. The 
"Fodor-affair" can always be heated up and used to question the 
cooperation between liberal parties; those who aim at this will 
do this. As for a social liberal coalition, I do not think that 
a situation could emerge in the wake of which I would change my 
opinion. I cannot know in advance whether a situation might 
emerge in which Hungary's interests require a cooperation 
between liberals and the socialists. In any case, I would be 
very glad if Hungary did not get into such a situation. My goal 
is to see Hungary led by a strong liberal center after May 1994. 
However, elections could lead to special situations. The 
Fidesz represents a principled position and, in a given case, 
surmounting party policy considerations, we could negotiate with 
every democratic party on cooperation. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] Can you see the possibilities of cooperation with 
the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] more clearly now that it 
again has a chairman? 
  [Orban] No. But I can generally see much more clearly now 
compared to the time before [former Prime Minister] Jozsef 
Antall separated the radical right wing from his party. I find 
the prime minister's statement reassuring when he says that the 
chances of cooperation between the MDF and the Hungarian Justice 
and Life Party are the same as that between the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] and the MSZP. I trust that the 
consolidation of the conservative forces will continue and this 
has to manifest itself, among other things, precisely in 
consistent distancing from the radical forces. This is desirable 
for all civic middle classes that are interested in politics. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] Do you feel that you have prepared to comply with 
all aspects of the responsibility of governing? 
  [Orban] The level of preparations can always be improved a 
little. However, it is a fact that, since 1992, large 
committees have been working on making the Fidesz suitable for 
government work. With this in mind, we expanded the Fidesz's 
expert basis, we formed our relations with other parties, 
employers, and -- with less success -- employee organizations in 
accordance with this, and we worked in foreign politics in the 
interest of this. 
  We are ready, taking the possibilities into consideration, 
to 
prepare Hungary for an earliest possible European Union and NATO 
membership. In spite of the economic policy failures, the 
country is enjoying some kind of stability; we are ready to 
preserve this, to launch an economic program that favors 
enterprises and establishes the conditions for growth, and to 
implement a grand educational reform. We have prepared as far 
as our abilities allow us and we will face the electors with a 
clear conscience: Here we are, the choice is yours. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Surjan, chairman of the Christian </F>
Democratic People's Party, by Eszter Radai; place and not given: 
"Service to the Nation -- Which Is the Real KDNP?"] 
  [Excerpts] With the approach of the elections, naturally 
all the parties are trying to show off their virtues to their 
prospective supporters. The Christian Democratic People's 
[KDNP] Party, often described as having a minor role in the 
coalition, is doing just this. Others call the Christian 
Democrat leaders grey and public opinion polls predict 
relatively few votes for the party. What are the views of 
Chairman Laszlo Surjan, who has recently been more prominent in 
public affairs, about all this and what are his actual plans? 
Eszter Radai interviewed him. 
  [Radai] The KDNP has been a dark horse for political 
analysts and the public for a long time. In the past, many 
people thought that the party would have multiplied its 
supporters by the end of the electoral cycle. However, this 
prediction does not seem to be coming true. According to 
opinion polls, the KDNP occupies one of the last two places 
among the parliamentary parties just as it did before. 
  [Surjan] The KDNP treats the results of opinion polls with 
care and caution. It does not ignore apparently unpleasant data 
but we do not start to celebrate even when the results are good; 
instead, we analyze them. In political speeches -- when one is 
a little bit more outspoken -- I usually say that in 1990, 2 
percent was predicted for us and we received 6.5 percent. If we 
again triple the predicted amount then I will be satisfied. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Radai] Of all the coalition parties, the KDNP has appeared 
to be the "most suitable for coalition" up to now, it was an 
acceptable partner for all the parties without exception, and it 
was included in all coalition speculations. Now, it seems to be 
you who are narrowing your options by saying that, in addition 
to the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], you cannot imagine a 
coalition with the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], either. 
  [Surjan] This formulation fits into the general tactics 
whereby party leaders do not make final and irrevocable 
statements; they only indicate their willingness for cooperation 
or the lack of it. The KDNP indeed does not have any desire to 
cooperate with the MSZP, and this is not being outlined with the 
SZDSZ, either. Many people are saying that a forced coalition 
might have to be formed in 1994. When the election results are 
known, all the parties will have to examine their consciences 
and they certainly must not forget about the governability of 
the country. Therefore, we will have to ponder about what 
consequences our participation or absence will have for the 
country. Can we follow or accept the former Italian model with 
governments changing every month? Is our economy already 
operating so well that it can run the country without politics 
mattering too much? Or is our situation quite different? In 
the meantime, the electors have the right to know what I will 
"bring upon them," what kind of government they are voting for 
when voting for me. The party leaders are not in the position 
to give clear answers to this. Therefore, they usually only 
express their willingness for collaboration and, naturally, 
rejections are expressed at various levels of leadership. 
However, it has to be seen that the issue will not be decided 
by them but, in the case of the KDNP, for example, a 50-member 
body will decide when the election results are known with whom 
and how we will negotiate. 
<H5>  Coalition -- With Whom? </H5>
  [Radai] Does this mean that you would not like to enter into 
coalition with the SZDSZ but would not reject it either? 
  [Surjan] When talking about the KDNP's center party position 
-- which is of course misunderstood by many people -- I usually 
refer to the fact that human dignity and the freedom of personal 
decision occupy a central place in the intellectual world of 
Christian democrats. Therefore, these parties can also come to 
an understanding with liberal parties; Germany is the best 
example for this where a successful coalition on this basis has 
been operating for years. However, the deep social commitment 
of this line is also well known, so a Christian democratic type 
party is also acceptable to social democrats, of which Austria 
is a good example. Therefore, our party is open in principle. 
On the other hand, we must not forget, either, that while all 
the parties are having sharp debates before the elections, these 
are actually artificial in terms of economic policy because 
almost everyone wants the same. [passage omitted] 
  [Radai] In your view, which is the KDNP's real face? The 
one represented by you, one of the leaders of European Christian 
democracy, or the one shown by the Mikloses [Gaspar, Hasznos, 
and Palos], those relentless justice makers and radicals, who 
sometimes even flirt with the Hungarian Justice and Life Party 
[MIEP]? And you also have so-called pragmatic people, who, 
being local government politicians, have not yet acquired 
national fame. A political analyst said that "the party 
chairman has been able to hold together people attracted to the 
radical right wing, followers of modern European Christian 
democracy, and the socially deeply committed Christian 
socialists." Which is the real KDNP? 
  [Surjan] I do not think that you mean this offensively but I 
have to reject it. It actually contradicts the statements that 
our opponents have been making for years, namely that this is a 
grey party. The point is that here, as in all normal parties, 
there is a constant movement, new colors are appearing, and if 
this party still manages to present a united front then this 
harmony is composed of diversity, rather than greyness. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Radai] Can you see any tendencies in the fact that the 
so-called radicals occupy prominent places on the KDNP's 
national list while the pragmatic young people are pushed low 
down, and only a few of the old and eminent politicians who are 
attracted to modern European Christian democracy are on it, and 
only then after a debate? 
  [Surjan] Nevertheless, of the older generation that you 
mention, we have Deputy Chairman Laszlo Varga in a prominent 
position on the list, and Sandor Keresztes, too, so this 
criticism is not justified. It is true that my idea and goal 
was that the members of a potential Christian Democratic 
government should be at the top of the list. However, the 
majority of the National Committee did not agree with this and I 
was in a minority at the voting. 
<H5>  Tactics -- How? </H5>
  [Radai] I have also heard views from certain Christian 
Democratic politicians that the prominent position of the 
radicals on the list is part of your election tactics. Through 
them -- they hope -- many votes can be gained from the extreme 
right in the second round of the elections. 
  [Surjan] I am not sure if election tactics can be the 
subject of interviews. A party that is able to gain voters from 
the extreme parties, therefore, is able to draw an uncertain 
section of society from the extreme to the center, and, I 
believe, is doing a service to the nation.

  [Text] A ceremony to install the new minister of national 
defense, Gheorghe Tinca, took place in Bucharest today. The 
ceremony, which took place without the participation of the 
press, was marked by the presence of Romanian Prime Minister 
Nicolae Vacaroiu. The ceremony was also attended by Lieutenant 
General Niculae Spiroiu, former minister of national defense, 
and other members of the leadership of the Ministry and the 
Superior Military Council of the Armed Forces. 
  After the ceremony Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca granted 
an 
interview to our reporters in which he expressed the hope that 
his dialogue with the military will be a very good one. The 
appointment of a civilian as head of the Defense Ministry, Mr. 
Tinca said, is part of a process aimed at modernizing our 
various structures, a process that we assumed by ourselves, as 
it was not imposed but rather merely suggested by European 
bodies. 
  Tinca also expressed his hope that the Armed Forces will 
benefit from his experience as a diplomat in its relations with 
parliament, the political parties, and other state bodies. He 
said that he will promote values such as calmness, tactfulness, 
sincerity, honesty and noted that he preferred open discussions 
to the benefit of the Armed Forces and the country. 
  At noon today at the headquarters of the Romanian Interior 
Ministry, in the presence of Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and 
members of the Interior Ministry Collegium, a ceremony was held 
to install new Interior Minister Doru Ioan Taracila. 
  In his speech Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu presented the 
personality of the new minister, pointing out that the 
appointment of a civilian personality to lead that ministry is 
part of the broad process of the country's democratization and 
its adaptation to the practices and standards of the advanced 
democracies. 
  After assessing the previous activity of the Ministry as 
positive, Vacaroiu thanked the former interior minister, 
Lieutenant General George Ioan Danescu, who was appointed state 
secretary and deputy of the interior minister. 
  New Interior Minister Doru Ioan Taracila stated that he will 
firmly act to continue reform and to boost the efficiency of 
actions aimed at fighting the phenomenon of infractions and the 
scourge of corruption and at ensuring law and public order. 
  Lieutenant General George Ioan Danescu mentioned a few 
issues 
in which the Ministry of Interior achieved progress over the 
past year and pointed out that in his new capacity he will work 
to improve the entire activity of the Ministry. The newly 
appointed interior minister is currently holding a news 
conference.

  [Text] In a statement to our reporters today, Democratic 
Party [PD] Chairman Petre Roman referred to the recent 
government reshuffle, expressing his disappointment that it had 
been done without first consulting with the other political 
forces and, especially, without first consulting with 
parliament. The reshuffle was done in this way despite the fact 
that lately the government party and the other parliamentary 
parties had been engaged in a dialogue, Roman said. Such 
consultations would have been necessary, he assessed, as some of 
the offices subjected to the reshuffle are important for our 
national interests. 
  Regarding the talks conducted by PD representatives with the 
leaders of PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania], Roman said 
that actually they were discussions rather than negotiations 
merely intended to clear up certain things. However, 
consultations and the dialogue have to be continued in order to 
concretely solve the problems and sorrows of the people. 
  The PD leader said that the current government seems to be 
detached from reality, which is a serious matter, considering 
the way the people's problems and sorrows have accumulated. 
Those who bear high responsibility in our society ought to show 
interest for all such problems, Roman pointed out, saying that 
the time is ripe for a program of hope and confidence.

  [Text] Current consultations between the PDSR [Social 
Democracy Party of Romania] ruling party and the other 
parliamentary formations is a new element in Romanian political 
life and, regardless of results, one should hail them because 
they will allow for better communication, proving that it is 
possible to hold a dialogue even if the political climate is 
quite tense, said PDSR Executive President Adrian Nastase to a 
morning program of Bucharest Radio. 
  Nastase mentioned that these consultations have only an 
exploratory character and that it is difficult to accomplish 
several steps in a brief time, given the big differences between 
parties in approaching various issues. However, for the time 
being it is very clear that the revitalization of the executive 
is necessary because the only realistic formula today is a 
monocolor, reshuffled PDSR government, meaning that it will be a 
government that has acquired a greater degree of competence and 
efficiency. 
  The parliamentary forces on both sides of the political 
spectrum will be able to support such a government in accordance 
with the initiatives that the executive is going to suggest. 
  Adrian Nastase did not wish to mention for the time being 
which are the portfolios that will be affected by the reshuffle, 
but stressed that the modifications in the government team could 
be carried out very soon. 
  Mircea Cosea, state minister and president of the Council 
for 
Coordination, Strategy, and Economic Reform, also talked about 
negotiations between political parties during an interview 
broadcast on Bucharest Radio this morning. He mentioned that 
there is a very encouraging development on this subject, meaning 
that the mutual accusations of anti-reformism have disappeared 
and the sides reached a stage where they accept reform as the 
only chance to come out of the current impasse. Likewise, the 
Chamber of Deputies and the Senate have given positive signs in 
connection with the memorandum concluded with the IMF and there 
is justified hope that in a reasonable time, the few laws that 
are still to be passed by the parliament and which are 
unquestionably necessary for the implementation of the 
memorandum will be adopted and will serve as a basis to 
reformulating the prognosis for 1994, an activity to start as 
early as next month. 
  Mircea Cosea warned the population that this year no 
economic 
miracle or a radical improvement of production and life 
conditions should be expected, but rather a gradual, step by 
step accumulation and a positive tendency, which would permit 
the revival of economic activity. Privatization will have to be 
accelerated indeed because it is high time to move on from words 
to facts. Thus, as of May 1994, the enterprises put on sale 
will be auctioned and thus a secondary market will be created 
for ownership certificates. 
  Cosea also announced that Iacob Zelenco was appointed 
secretary of state at the Privatization Agency on the basis of 
his experience and competence. 
  As far as the issue of attracting foreign investors is 
concerned, substantial progress has been achieved in 
negotiations with important firms such as [?Credit Bank] and 
[name indistinct] and finalization of accord is expected with 
the latter during President Ion Iliescu's upcoming visit to 
South Korea. 
  Mircea Cosea also approached the issue of inflation and 
increase of prices, which he considered as being normal for the 
present situation, when the issue of exchange rate is being 
worked out. He added that certainly, in the second half of this 
year, a more adequate rate of inflation will be reached as wel 
as a relative decrease of prices. 
  His conclusion was that our country has reached a phase of 
real and irreversible reform, which consists of a more alert 
pace of privatization and restructuring but also a more careful 
evaluation of social costs of transition.

  [Text] During its Romanian visit, a three-member delegation 
of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] met today with the 
former Romanian Prime Minister Petre Roman. The central issue 
of their talks with all the political parties so far was the 
rights of minorities in Romania. Our special correspondent 
Judit Laszlo reports from Bucharest: 
  [Laszlo] The Democratic Party, led by former Prime Minister 
Petre Roman, considers itself a social democratic party, though 
a liberal one in economic matters. Therefore its program is 
similar to the SZDSZ's program, Gabor Kuncze, parliamentary 
deputy group leader of the SZDSZ, said. Minority rights have 
also been on the agenda of their talks with Petre Roman. It is 
Romania's primary interest to guarantee minority rights and to 
avoid ethnic conflicts, the former Romanian prime minister said. 
  Senate President Oliviu Gherman also met the SZDSZ 
delegation. He promised that Romanian legislation will, in the 
near future, ratify the readmission agreement and agreements 
concluded by the two countries on avoiding double taxation and 
on the protection of investments. The issue of establishing a 
Hungarian university is also on the agenda. The Romanian 
negotiating party accepted the need for it but drew attention to 
the difficulties of its realization, Kuncze said. He told the 
chairman of the Senate that it would be desirable if Hungarians 
in Romania could peacefully celebrate 15 March [anniversary of 
the Hungarian revolution and war of independence in 1848]. A 
Romanian extremist leader has recently called this celebration 
an anti-Romanian action. 
  There was great understanding on political matters between 
the Young Liberals--a party of the Civic Alliance--and the 
SZDSZ, particularly with regard to the situation of Hungarians. 
The leaders of the Romanian opposition expressed their views 
that Romania's democratic future depends directly on a 
responsible policy by the leadership of the Hungarian Democratic 
Union of Romania [HDUR] and, last but not least, on the 
statements of the Hungarian Government in power. The liberal 
parties would also like HDUR not to monopolize the protection of 
minorities. At the same time, other parties should also 
undertake this issue. The SZDSZ delegation has agreed with this 
idea.

  [Text] In Bucharest today the Hungarian Cultural Center 
hosted a news conference by a delegation for Hungary's Alliance 
of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. SZDSZ leader Gabor Kuncze and Istvan 
Szentivanyi, deputy chairman of the Foreign Relations Commission 
of Hungary's parliament and a member of SZDSZ, answered the 
questions asked by the journalists. 
  Our correspondent Letitia Militaru inquired about the 
SZDSZ's 
chances in the 8 May elections. 
  [Begin recording] [Militaru, in Romanian with simultaneous 
Hungarian translation] What are SZDSZ's chances in the 8 May 
elections? 
  [Kuncze, in Hungarian with simultaneous Romanian 
translation] 
Naturally I cannot discuss this issue in an unbiased way, but I 
think our chances are very good. According to public opinion 
polls, the SZDSZ is the second-strongest party and its 
popularity is growing continuously. If we add up the two 
liberal-oriented parties in Hungary, the liberal bloc could have 
a great weight. 
  [Militaru] How does your party view the Romanian-Hungarian 
relations? 
  [Kuncze] In the eyes of SZDSZ, Hungarian-Romanian ties have 
a strategic importance. It is a strategic one owing to the fact 
that we are neighbors, owing to the Hungarian ethnic minority 
living here, and owing to our economic interests. The 
efficiency of Hungarian diplomacy could be measured by the way 
in which it will manage to achieve progress in this issue. 
  [Militaru] What does the Hungarian ethnic minority living in 
Romania mean to the SZDSZ? 
  [Kuncze] I think it is important to state that we cannot 
restrict our bilateral relations merely to our ties with that 
minority, which should be just a part of our bilateral 
relations. Culturally speaking, the Hungarian ethnic minority 
belongs to the Hungarian nation. Hungary's Constitution 
stipulates that every Hungarian government has to consider 
itself responsible for the Hungarians living outside the 
country's borders and to protect their interests. As far as I 
know, Romania's Constitution, in Paragraph 2 of its Article 7, 
contains similar stipulations.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Professor Dariusz Rosati, </F>
Democratic Left Alliance candidate for deputy prime minister and 
finance minister, in Geneva, by Krzysztof Skowronski at the 
Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet" 
program--live] 
  [Text] [Skowronski] What is the weather like in Geneva? 
  [Rosati] The weather is lovely, it is very warm. 
  [Skowronski] How warm? 
  [Rosati] Twelve degrees Celsius. 
  [Skowronski] Do you really feel like leaving such a warm 
sunny city for Warsaw to fill such a difficult post in our 
government? 
  [Rosati] Well, the proposal is definitely interesting and 
attractive. Perhaps it will offset the losses resulting from 
the change in the climate. 
  [Skowronski] Have you made a final decision yet? 
  [Rosati] I have agreed that my candidacy for the two posts 
you mentioned be submitted to Prime Minister Pawlak. However, 
it is really hard to tell now what the decision of the prime 
minister and then of the president will be. 
  [Skowronski] When will you meet with Prime Minister Pawlak? 
  [Rosati] We have an appointment to meet in a few days. 
During that talk, we are going to agree as to what our economy 
should look like in the immediate future and what should be done 
to maintain the growth trend and to ensure that the situation 
gradually improves. 
  [Skowronski] What should our economy look like in the 
immediate future? 
  [Rosati] Well, everyone wants it to look as good as 
possible, everyone wants an improvement of the situation. 
However, there are certain limitations: A budget has been 
passed that imposes certain limits on this year's economic 
policy. Certain legal solutions are in rather advanced stages; 
they will decide what will be happening in the economy in the 
next few months or half-year. However, a more long-term vision 
of development should be given some thought--what should be done 
so that the economy can start developing intensively and in a 
balanced manner. 
  [Skowronski] Do you envision any changes in the economic 
policy of our state? 
  [Rosati] Well, it is difficult for me to envision anything 
now because, as I have said, the issue is still being discussed 
by the coalition partners, as I understand it. Now, as an 
economist I think that Poland is going through a stage when 
certain growth trends should be strengthened; one should think 
about some steps that would allow investment expansion to 
increase, that would allow us to accelerate exports; only on the 
road to economic growth are we able to resolve the problems that 
we have now--the crisis of public finances, mass unemployment, 
and so on and so forth. 
  [Skowronski] How can growth trends in the economy be 
strengthened? 
  [Rosati] A number of steps can be taken that would simply 
improve the investment climate, that would encourage investors 
to invest their money, and that would make those investments 
possible by increasing financial means, decreasing the 
uncertainty concerning the future, and introducing a certain 
stabilization of the rules of play. 
  [Skowronski] Does the increase in accessibility mean more 
money on the market, or is it something else? 
  [Rosati] A number of solutions are possible here that do not 
necessarily lead to increasing the quantity of money on the 
market but that will create incentives to invest money. Of 
course, these solutions also include financial policy 
instruments. Because we are talking about money, let me tell 
you that such solutions make sense and are effective in the long 
run only when they do not accelerate inflation; this is a very 
important limitation that I believe will be strictly observed. 
  [Skowronski] Are you going to continue the policy of 
Former Deputy Prime Minister Borowski? 
  [Rosati] Even though he has not finished it, Mr. Borowski 
started a certain maneuver in the area of economic policy that, 
as I see and understand it, can be summed up as follows: A 
restrictive, responsible, strict economic policy should be 
continued, but it should at the same time be supplemented by 
certain steps that would stimulate economic growth and decrease 
as much as possible the negative social results of some steps 
that are necessary from the point of view of economics. In this 
sense, such a policy definitely deserves to be continued. 
  [Skowronski] How do you evaluate everything that has 
happened in Poland since 1990--that is, mainly the Balcerowicz 
plan? 
  [Rosati] My evaluation of the Balcerowicz plan is positive. 
I think that generally it was certainly a correct decision. In 
a further stage of the implementation of the program, let us say 
that, after a year or two, certain changes could and should have 
been made. These changes were not made; perhaps the evaluation 
of the situation was different, or maybe I am wrong. However, 
generally speaking, the direction of the transformations we 
began in 1990 was absolutely correct. 
  [Skowronski] What is your evaluation of the privatization 
process in Poland? 
  [Rosati] I would like this process to be much more advanced 
and quicker. Privatization is the part of the transformations 
that is of paramount importance if we want to increase the 
efficiency of the economy, increase the sensitivity or the 
manner of responding of companies to market signals. It is 
certainly easier to carry out a macroeconomic policy in an 
economy that has many private companies than in an economy, such 
as ours, where there still are a lot of state-run enterprises, 
which look at things differently, which have a different 
hierarchy of purposes, and which simply operate with a different 
configuration of motivations. 
  [Skowronski] That means that privatization is a very 
positive factor in the economy? 
  [Rosati] Yes, privatization is very positive. It should be 
continued, and I believe that there are possibilities of 
accelerating it and perhaps employing more diversified methods 
and means of accelerating it. 
  [Skowronski] What about the exchange rate of the dollar? 
Has this exchange rate been correctly set in Poland? Or should 
we change anything here? 
  [Rosati] Well, again, I understand that I should answer this 
question as an economist... 
  [Skowronski, interrupting] Yes, certainly as an economist. 
  [Rosati] The decision concerning the exchange rate and the 
exchange-rate policy is up to the president of the National Bank 
of Poland [NBP]. I believe that the exchange-rate policy should 
really be a little more active; however, I do not think that, in 
these concrete conditions...[Rosati pauses] Again I will tell 
you that I am saying this on the basis of...[Rosati pauses] I do 
not have all of the information I would need to express my 
opinion on this with full responsibility. However, as I see it, 
at the moment more important for stimulating the exports and for 
opening the economy are certain institutional solutions that are 
beyond the exchange-rate policy. Now, generally speaking, the 
effectiveness of the exchange-rate policy in the past years has 
not been such as it should and could have been. 
  [Skowronski] And if you are indeed appointed deputy prime 
minister, what will be your first priority in office? 
  [Rosati] Well, you know, I will familiarize myself in a 
detailed manner with the budget and with those draft laws that 
are now in the Sejm or on the finance minister's desk. I will 
first of all find out what progress has been made in terms of 
proposals for systemwide solutions that the current coalition 
submitted [hesitating] before the elections or immediately after 
the elections, and then I will deal with a good formulation of 
certain principles having to do with long-term economic policies 
and what our goals are for the next two to three years. I will 
deal with that issue as the second-most-important priority. 
Actually, I will deal with that simultaneously. 
  [Skowronski] And what about right now? Where are we heading 
right now? I mean if you were to evaluate what we have been 
doing in Poland for four years, where are we heading? 
  [Rosati] We are heading toward building an efficient market 
economy, where the people's standard of living will be good. We 
all wanted that to happen, beginning with the start of the 
transformations in 1990. The process of transformation proved 
more costly than had been expected; my view is that it could 
have been less costly. My feeling is that the most difficult 
part of the process is already behind us, and I think that--you 
have already asked me about that--the former finance ministers 
also greatly contributed to that, primarily Leszek Balcerowicz. 
Nonetheless, I think the right conditions and a chance now 
exist for an acceleration of economic growth trends. 
  [Skowronski] You just said the most difficult phase is 
already behind us, but you know perfectly well that a wave of 
strikes is just beginning in Poland. Today was the first day of 
strikes and you probably have not received news on that--there 
was not too much of that. 
  [Rosati] You know, of course, those social aspects that 
result either from disappointments with regard to some necessary 
cost of the transformation or from the fact that some specific 
mistakes have been made--these are very important aspects of 
development that cannot be ignored. Perhaps it is the case 
that, in the past, one used to [hesitating] put too much stress 
on conducting policies according to some textbook patterns and 
ignoring, to some extent, certain social consequences of 
applying these patterns. That does absolutely not mean that 
social consequences will be a determinant factor in shaping 
economic policies. Unfortunately, there are certain economic 
principles that simply cannot be taken lightly, so the policies 
will be--or at least should be, in my view--reasonable. 
  [Skowronski] Would you be willing to attempt to convince 
those on strike that it is not worth it? 
  [Rosati] I think one should always make such attempts 
because only....[Rosati pauses] I think that not enough social 
communication was perhaps one of the reasons for all these 
social conflicts that accompany these efforts aimed at 
transformations and building a market economy. 
  [Skowronski] What kind of an argument would you use [in 
talking to the strikers]? A lot of arguments have already been 
used, and they ceased to be effective. 
  [Rosati] You know, I do not think at all that the strikers 
just consist of people who have no idea of economic issues. I am 
deeply convinced that rational arguments can be accepted. I am 
also convinced that, even if there are rational arguments, a 
whole lot of people--actually [hesitating], quite a lot of 
people in Poland--have completely genuine and justified 
grievances concerning the fact that their lots have radically 
deteriorated. I think one can find such solutions that will to 
some extent make life easier for some social groups, but one 
must also be aware that, without some kind of firm concept of a 
policy that would finally lead us to permanent growth, the 
country will simply collapse. 
  [Skowronski] And you claim to have precisely such a concept? 
  [Rosati] I think a concept based primarily on a policy of 
economic growth is one that may be formulated and that is not 
just my personal one but is also shared by a number of 
economists. That is actually the only chance to solve the 
problems of unemployment, public finances, and low salaries when 
you look long term--well, actually, not long term but let us say 
medium term. These three problems I mentioned are striking a 
lethal blow to the Polish economy right now. 
  [Skowronski] There are economists who say that the money 
supply in Poland is not high enough. Are you among them? 
  [Rosati] You know [hesitating], the situation with money is 
that one can only introduce as much of it into the economic 
system, as much as society is willing to accept. 
  [Skowronski] I think people are willing to accept... 
  [Rosati, interrupting] No, no, I mean demand for money. 
Demand for money is... 
  [Skowronski, interrupting] It is high in Poland. 
  [Rosati] Demand for money when we speak in economic terms 
means demand for that money that people have in their pockets, 
as opposed to that which is immediately spent on day-to-day 
transactions. So this issue requires thorough research and 
debates--of course, also with the NBP, which probably has more 
information on that. My view is that [hesitating] perhaps there 
is some possibility of increasing the money supply, while 
meeting certain terms that could be helpful in terms of growth 
and that would not necessarily have inflationary effects. 
  [Skowronski] Would you please remain on the line for a 
moment while Michal Kowalewski reads a newscast during which he 
will tell us what that is interesting has happened recently in 
Poland and around the world? Would you please listen to it, and 
I have two more questions for you that I will ask after the 
newscast? Is that all right? 
  [Rosati] That is fine with me. 
  [Skowronski] Let me remind you that Radio Zet's guest 
today is Prof. Dariusz Rosati, the Democratic Left Alliance 
[SLD] candidate for the post of deputy prime minister and 
finance minister. 
  Is the same kind of news being broadcast by radio stations 
in 
Geneva right now? I mean you did not hear the one now, but let 
us say from today's newscasts--was the news the same or similar? 
  [Rosati] In terms of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Yugoslavia, yes, 
these are the main news items all the time. 
  [Skowronski] And now to return to Polish issues: What is 
your view on the stock market and on everything that happened in 
the Bank Slaski case? 
  [Rosati] The stock market is a very positive phenomenon in 
what is happening in Poland; I think the incredible increase in 
share prices over the past six months--I think that is not to be 
repeated in the future, let me put it this way. It was linked 
to an entire array of factors that simply caused, first of all, 
the increase in share prices, and, second, they caused private 
investors to go after shares immediately. Second [as heard], 
there occurred such a shift in the prices of shares that we had 
an opportunity of witnessing also in the case of Bank Slaski. 
This boom or incredible growth will be slowed down, and I think 
there will occur a certain cooling down of the heated 
atmosphere, but I do not think any disaster will happen. 
  [Skowronski] And you think interference by politicians is 
not called for in the stock market, and you would not be willing 
to take the initiative when it comes to the stock market? 
  [Rosati] Of course, the government should keep its hands off 
these issues as best it can. Stock market and capital market 
measures in general are an extremely delicate mechanism that is 
guided to a large extent, alas, by imponderables and certain 
purely psychological factors, and so one must be aware of that 
while making decisions or even declarations on that issue. 
  [Skowronski] Let us return to your future conversation with 
Prime Minister Pawlak. What preconditions will you set? 
  [Rosati] I think I will begin by asking the prime minister 
what he expects me to do in the government. Of course, if we 
manage to come to some agreement or some common strategic policy 
on program-related issues--that is a fundamental issue--it is my 
intention to ask the prime minister to help me assure creating 
certain conditions that will make it possible for the government 
to act efficiently in the area of the economy. 
  [Skowronski] Could you give us a list of those items you 
will definitely not give up? What kinds of concessions can you 
not make? Of course, it is hard to speak about that because 
first of all... 
  [Rosati, interrupting] It is hard to speak about it because 
one probably has a number of principles, depending on what it is 
that we are talking about. If you could phrase the question 
more precisely, perhaps I could answer it. 
  [Skowronski] Well, in that case, perhaps I will give it up. 
  To end the interview, how would you describe your views: Are 
you a social democrat, a liberal, or do they use completely 
different terms nowadays with regard to economists and economics 
professors? 
  [Rosati] Well, I am first of all an economist, and that is 
how I view my role in the government. 
  [Skowronski] What about a liberal? Are you offended by such 
a label? 
  [Rosati] No, I do not feel offended if someone calls me a 
liberal. On the contrary, I think that the liberal doctrine, if 
one perceives it the right way, and I want to say that 
liberalism is perceived one way in Europe but quite another way 
in America; these are completely different concepts, so, 
generally speaking, I have nothing against using the term. But 
of course, one would have to define the term with precision in 
the first place, to find out what it really means. 
  [Skowronski] And how did Mr. Aleksander Kwasniewski come 
across you? How did the proposition come about? 
  [Rosati] The best thing would be to ask Mr. Kwasniewski 
himself. 
  [Skowronski] When did you find out that you were a candidate 
for deputy prime minister? How did it happen? 
  [Rosati] I was asked a preliminary question of whether I 
would be interested in it at all. That was about three weeks ago. 
  [Skowronski] So three weeks have already passed. You see 
how tight-lipped the SLD coalition is? There were no leaks at 
all to the press, and so the press failed to find out about your 
candidacy. 
  [Rosati] Perhaps that was just a simple question, without 
any political ramifications. 
  [Skowronski] But it turned out otherwise. What are you doing 
in Geneva? 
  [Rosati] I am working at the European Economic Commission, 
and I deal with analyses and assessments of the macroeconomic 
situation in East European countries. 
  [Skowronski] Thank you very much for the conversation, and I 
wish you a good night. 
  Radio Zet's guest today has been Prof. Dariusz Rosati, the 
SLD's candidate for the post of deputy prime minister and 
finance minister. 
  [Rosati] Thank you very much.

  [Excerpt] [Announcer] A strike organized by Solidarity 
started an hour ago in 100 enterprises in Katowice province. 
  [Correspondent Pagiela] The Wanda textile plant in 
Sosnowiec, the mining electronic equipment plant in Tychy, and 
the Fablok locomotive factory in Chrzanow are among the 
enterprises on strike. We have been told that the OPZZ 
[All-Polish Trade Union Agreement] unions have joined the 
strike. Despite earlier announcements, muncipal transport is 
not on strike in Silesia. Marek Kepski, chairman of the 
Solidarity Silesia-Dabrowa region, said that a strike of public 
transport would inconvenience the public, and Solidarity wants 
to avoid this. The decision as to whether a public transport 
strike should take place in Silesia will probably be made on 15 
March. 
  [Announcer] Piotr Pagiela was speaking from Katowice. 
  Public transport in Koszalin was not working between 0400 
and 
0700 hours because the work force of the MZK [Municipal 
Transport Enterprise] joined the Solidarity strike. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by B.I.W. and PAD: "Strike Action of Solidarity; </F>
From Slupsk to Mines"] 
  [Text] The strike at two plants in the Slupsk Region of 
Solidarity started a protest action of the trade union. Monday 
[7 March] was "the first day of large-scale money collection" in 
regions for the strike fund. On each day now, there are 
supposed to be increasingly more serious strikes. Between 0900 
and 1100 today, steel workers in 74 plants, primarily in 
Silesia, will go on strike. Beginning Wednesday, "the 
significant regions"--for example, the plants in the Lodz 
Region--will strike for two hours. At that time, in Lodz, the 
National Committee [KK] of Solidarity will debate the current 
situation and further steps concerning the action. On Thursday, 
pit-coal mines will strike for two hours and block coal 
shipments for the entire day. 
<H5>  Strike for Minimum Wage </H5>
  According to Piotr Zak, press spokesman of the Solidarity 
KK, 
each member of the union will pay on average between 50,000 and 
100,000 zlotys [Z] to the strike fund; the size of the 
remuneration for the participation in the strike has been 
initially set at approximately Z75,000 per day (minimum day's 
earning). However, everything will depend on the state of the 
account. 
  On 7 March in Bialystok, Deputy Prime Minister Wlodzimierz 
Cimoszewicz said that the Solidarity strikes are political and 
"disrespecting to the law." "No government established as a 
result of truly democratic elections can accept such a dictate," 
said Cimoszewicz, suggesting that Solidarity should ask itself a 
question concerning responsibility to the state. 
<H5>  Stoppages and Flags </H5>
  According to "Solidarity," 95 percent of the work force of 
the Wood Industry Plants in Slawno and the Heat Energy 
Enterprise participated in the four-hour strike. In the latter 
action, the water temperature was lowered by 10 degrees Celsius. 
If the weather had been frosty, the strike would have been felt 
by town inhabitants. Head of the region, Edward Muller, said 
that next time "people will get 100 percent of the heat, 
industry--zero." 
  In Elblag Voivodship, in Pieniezno, the supply of heat was 
completely cut off. A warning strike was also organized on 7 
March in the Agricultural Machines Factory in Czarna Bialostocka. 
  The strike alert has been announced in the Lomza and Suwalki 
Voivodships, where there will probably be no great strikes. The 
following regions are getting ready for active participation in 
the action: Bydgoszcz, Torun, and the region of Kujawy and 
Ziemia Dobrzynska (Wloclawek), which on 7 March announced a 
passive strike. The Swietokrzyski Region has announced a higher 
state of strike readiness. 
  In Malopolska, strike readiness has already been reported by 
approximately 70 enterprises, including the metal branch and the 
Polish State Railroads. The first strike will probably be held 
there in the middle of this week. 
  Also 12 enterprises of the Bialystok Voivodship and several 
of the biggest plants in the Bielsko Biala voivodships have 
announced their readiness for an active strike. In the Mazowsze 
Region, referendums among work forces are still under way. 
<H5>  Steel Workers and Miners </H5>
  On 8 March, 74 plants of the National Steel Works' Section 
of 
Solidarity, including the Tadeusz Sedzimir Steel Works in 
Krakow, will go on strike. A several-hour-long progressive 
strike will be organized in several plants in Koszalin. Lodz 
will be on strike on 9 March, and the Silesian branch of 
Solidarity will continue its progressive strike. On 10 March, 
there will be a two-hour warning strike in all pit-coal mines; 
miners will block the shipment of coal for 24 hours. Miners' 
Solidarity Spokesman Adam Jawor did not rule out the possibility 
that in some mines the strike may last eight hours. On 10 
March, a one-hour warning strike is supposed to be staged in 
Gdansk. 
  On 7 March, Solidarity Head Marian Krzaklewski requested 
that 
the industry minister present him with data on the average 
demand for electricity in the morning and evening rush hours 
from the energy grid. This has to do with the possibility of a 
strike in the fuel-energy sector: "The data are indispensable 
for coordinating the supply of as much fuel as is needed by the 
system to ensure electricity production exclusively for 
individual customers," wrote the head of Solidarity.

<F P=106> [Article by B.I.W., PAD, and B.C.: "Miller: Solidarity </F>
Forces an Opened Door; Jankowski: Strikes May Last Several 
Months"] 
  [Text] It has been confirmed that on Friday [11 March] 
railroads workers are going to stage a 10-hour strike. 
Yesterday, work at over a dozen plants associated in the 
National Steel Works Section of Solidarity was suspended; 
rallies were held in other plants and money was collected for 
strike funds. 
  At a conference organized in the morning at the Office of 
the 
Council of Ministers [URM], the government stated that it is not 
able to change the Budget Law--it has been passed by parliament: 
it has been holding talks with trade unions since January, so 
Solidarity cannot accuse it of having too little good will to 
negotiate; Solidarity can negotiate its demands in the 
trilateral committee; miners are only "an instrument of force" 
and will not receive any money for striking; the strike by 
railroads workers is illegal. The government did not say this 
directly; however, it is not going to forward a special 
invitation for "Solidarity" to attend talks. 
<H5>  Yesterday Steel Works, Tomorrow Miners </H5>
  Today in Lodz, the National Committee [KK] of Solidarity 
will 
hold a session. Unofficial information suggests that there 
appear to be two options for further action: one can either 
expect an escalation of the protest, or--this is more 
likely--Solidarity may suspend the protests in two weeks or so 
because of the uncompromising attitude adopted by the government. 
  The same sources maintain that the collection of money for 
the strike fund "is going quite well." The funds will be placed 
in an interest-bearing account. 
  In a few months' time, Solidarity may take advantage of the 
social dissatisfaction and, with the necessary financial means, 
may organize a serious action, perhaps not in all sectors of the 
economy but "in several important sectors that are vital from a 
strategic point of view." 
  KK Press Spokesman Piotr Zak evaluated the 8 March strikes 
as 
a success for the trade union: "According to our information, 
participating in the protest action were four plants in the 
Koszalin voivodship, as well as 80 plants in the steel works 
branch--69 in the two-hour warning strike; in 11 plants money 
was collected for the strike fund." 
  Fourteen steel plants were on strike in Silesia; in the 
other 
11, money was collected for the strike fund--the workers 
earmarked 2 percent of their earnings to the cause. On strike 
were, among other plants, the following steel works: Bankowa, 
Zawiercie, Baildon, Batory, Bobrek, Zabrze, as well as 
Czestochowa and Sendzimira in Krakow. In the Lucchini-Warsaw 
steel works, only two rallies were organized, in which 
participating were only those employees (approximately 350 
persons) who could leave their work posts without causing a drop 
in production. The plant decided that it could not afford to go 
on active strike in a situation where there were already 
production delays. During one of the rallies, Mazowsze Region 
Head Maciej Jankowski said that "what we are starting today may 
last as long as several months--fight for the rights of 
employees has always been long and calls for considerable 
determination." 
  Warning strikes will be staged today at plants in and 
around Lodz, as well as at 100 selected plants in the 
Silesian-Dabrowa region. On 10 March, strikes are supposed to be 
staged in Gdansk and at pit-coal mines. Deputy Industry 
Minister Eugeniusz Morawski told URM that mining and energy "are 
not the area of the strike; they are the instruments of forcing 
decisions." He believes that here "the issue is political." He 
stated that the strike in these branches leads to 
destabilization and added that the violations of the law will be 
scrupulously registered; he will insist on coal partnerships not 
paying "a single penny" toward the strike. "If any of the 
partnerships does make any such payments, I will institute legal 
proceedings to find out about the results of such an unjustified 
gift." 
<H5>  Railroads Workers "Illegally"? </H5>
  "The 10-hour strike by railroad workers is supposed to 
affect 
the entire Polish State Railroads [PKP] network, in both freight 
and passenger traffic. The protest will be organized between 
0900 [0800 GMT] and 1900," assured Railroads Solidarity Head 
Krzysztof Maminski. He did not rule out the possibility, 
however, that the strikes may be staged as soon as Thursday. He 
assured that rescue and special trains will be allowed to pass; 
he also did not exclude the possibility that some international 
trains that near their destination when the strike starts, will 
be allowed to reach their destinations. 
  At a URM news conference, PKP Director General Aleksander 
Janiszewski said that Solidarity was informed that their wage 
demands are impossible to meet--PKP would have to pay from 500 
million to 1 billion zlotys of the popiwek [tax on excessive 
wage increases]. Therefore, lower increases were put into 
effect, which were agreed upon with the other trade unions. 
Janiszewski deemed the Solidarity strike illegal because the 
PKP General Administration "finds out about it from the press, 
whereas, in line with the law, it should have been informed 
about it five days ahead of time." As a consequence, PKP will 
take steps to oppose it. 
<H5>  The Government Is Ready and Waiting </H5>
  Labor Minister Leszek Miller said on 8 March that the fact 
that Solidarity is forcing the government to hold talks with 
trade unions is like "forcing an opened door" because it has 
been holding such talks almost since the very first day it was 
established. According to him, the negotiations on social 
guarantees and the trilateral committee have such broad powers 
that they are a sufficient platform for discussions and 
negotiations on any demands. 
  Miller stressed that the government cannot implement the 
demand that the budget be changed because the budget has already 
been passed by parliament; however, the trilateral committee may 
discuss next year's budget. Andrzej Baczkowski, deputy labor 
minister and head of the trilateral committee, added that the 
committee may discuss any topic, and it can be convened at once 
if Solidarity decides that it is willing talk.

  [Text] Labor Minister Leszek Miller has called the 
statement by Solidarity leaders--that the union intended, by 
staging strikes, to make the government commence talks--forcing 
open the door that is already open. Leszek Miller rejected the 
union's accusations, pointing out a number of negotiations that 
have been conducted with the unions since the moment this 
government was formed. 
  [Begin Miller recording] From the moment the government was 
formed, talks have been taking place in various ministries on 
the restructuring of plants in Mielec, Lodz, and Walbrzych. 
Talks have been taking place on the restructuring of Polish 
State Railways. In January, talks began with the mining trade 
union federations, in the form of both a review and 
negotiations. As a result of those talks, an agreement on 
social protection in the mining industry was signed last week. 
Finally, on 18 January, the Council of Ministers made a 
decision on beginning talks on social guarantees for citizens. 
These talks are still taking place, and significant progress 
has already been achieved. 
  In conclusion, let me also mention a fact that is of great 
importance also from the point of view of the political system: 
On 15 February, the Council of Ministers made a decision on the 
setting up of a tripartite commission for socioeconomic affairs. 
This is an event that is significant for the political system 
because a platform for negotiating and resolving disputes has 
now been built into the sociopolitical landscape of our country. 
What is more, this will happen with the future in mind, because 
this is a tripartite setup, characteristic of West European 
systems, where employers, trade unions, and the government have 
an opportunity to hold serious talks and search for ways to 
ensure social peace. 
  When it comes to the other two demands that have been 
surfacing--the demand for the budget to be amended--the 
government cannot negotiate this demand because the parliament 
recently approved the budget. If the government wanted to 
influence the Sejm now, in order to make it work out radical 
changes in the budget, the government would not only fail to be 
acting in a serious way, but would also breach the democratic 
principles of a law-abiding state. 
  The second demand concerns the Enterprise Pact. The 
government cannot influence the pace at which the pact 
regulations are approved by the parliament. The government has 
already submitted five bills. One of them has been passed and is 
in force. The second bill on the enterprise social fund is 
awaiting the president's signature. The remaining ones are 
currently being examined by the extraordinary commission working 
on the Enterprise Pact. [end recording] 
  Eugeniusz Morawski, deputy minister of industry and trade, 
and Aleksander Janiszewski, director general of Polish State 
Railways, who took part in the meeting with journalists, both 
agreed that strategic areas of economy such as the power and 
mining industries, as well as the railways, were not a scene of 
social conflict but an instrument of political struggle.

  [Text] Several cases of cease-fire violations were 
registered in Sarajevo yesterday, UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] representative Major Jose (La Bandeira) said today. 
Three soldiers of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army were injured by 
small arms fire from the Serbian aggressor's positions. 
  Major (La Bandeira) confirmed that six howitzers of the 
Serbian aggressor are positioned 900 meters inside the protected 
zone around Sarajevo. They are situated near Ilijas. UNPROFOR 
is negotiating their withdrawal with Karadzic's Serbs even 
though these howitzers should have long since been removed or 
placed under the control of the peace troops on the basis of the 
NATO ultimatum and the agreement reached at Sarajevo airport.

  [Excerpts] Visoko, Bosnia-Herzegovina, March 8 (AFP) -- 
[Passage omitted] In Visoko, the base for the Canadian troops 
patrolling the Kiseljak region, about 40 kilometres (24 miles) 
northwest of Sarajevo, Lieutenant Bruno Vanasse said Tuesday [8 
March] that the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was well aware 
the Croat HVO army had not surrendered most of its weapons. 
  "We know there are two to four tanks and since the beginning 
of January there have been two multiple rocket launchers 
sighted," Vanasse, an intelligence officer, said in an interview 
with AFP. 
  But he said that while Bosnian Moslem and Croat armies had 
clearly not met the noon (1100 GMT) Monday deadline to withdraw 
all heavy weapons from some 350 kilometres (210 miles) of front 
lines, the ceasefire remained a success. 
  "We know they don't want war. The implementation of the 
agreement was under their initiative. 
  "They've been fighting for a year and nothing's changed. 
Both sides are losing," Vanasse said. The Moslem-Croat 
fighting is in three main areas, two of them totally isolated 
pockets held by the HVO. 
  Mortars and anti-aircraft guns were to be pulled back 10 
kilometres (six miles) from front lines and tanks and artillery 
20 kilometres (12 miles). 
  Weapons not withdrawn by the Croats in the enclaves were to 
be placed under UNPROFOR control in five collection sites. The 
Moslems have room to withdraw their weapons, Vanasse said. The 
Moslems have requested 1,200 litres of fuel to move their guns, 
UN press officer Captain Niels Otto Pedersen of Denmark said 
Tuesday in Kislejak. 
  He said that on Sunday Croat forces had handed in 57 heavy 
weapons in the Vitez pocket, mainly mortars but including some 
multiple rocket launchers. 
  Captain Raymond Belanger, press officer for the Canadians in 
Visoko, said it was clear the two sides had "not fixed a 
realistic deadline." He said the same caution had to be applied 
to the setting up of UN checkpoints to replace those of the 
warring parties and guarantee free access on crucial roads. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Croats have refused to take down their checkpoints at 
some sites. Belanger said of one, only a few hundred metres 
(yards) in front of a UNPROFOR site on the road from Kiseljak to 
Visoko: "It's there. We leave it there. They let people 
through. 
  "We're just trying to let things calm down." 
  Meanwhile, at the Kiseljak arms collection point, the 
Canadian troops have two tanks with 50 mm guns deployed to 
protect the former brick factory, now gutted and empty, that 
houses the surrendered weapons. 
  Dube said the Croatians had wanted to leave two of their men 
to watch over the weapons but this was refused. The 
Sarajevo-style heavy arms withdrawal that began Monday for 
warring Croats and Moslems provides that arms left with UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) troops are not to be recuperated. 
  The Canadians said they were ready to fight to keep anyone 
from taking the weapons, which included a 14.5 mm machine gun, 
two M-60 heavy machine guns, six 82 mm mortars, and three 120 mm 
mortars. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, 8 Mar (TANJUG) -- Nikola Koljevic, the 
vice president of the Srpska republic, and Charles Redman, the 
U.S. President's special envoy, today agreed that the Bosnian 
Serbs should equitably and actively join the next phase of 
negotiations on ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina initiated by an agreement 
between the Muslims and Croats in Washington. 
  Koljevic and Redman today talked for about an hour in 
Belgrade. They stated that they had discussed a method of 
resuming negotiations so as to bring about an acceptable and 
comprehensive solution rather than any concrete proposals. 
  Their press statements convey their shared view that peace 
is 
more certain in the wake of the Washington talks, with an 
increasing possibility of reaching a global agreement. 
  Koljevic stressed that "this plan recognizes the Serb people 
as being a constituent people with all rights, and that it will 
be involved in the further peace process." 
  According to Koljevic, the Serb side has no political 
proposal as yet, whereas whether and how the Bosnian Serbs will 
join the Muslim-Croat federal agreement will be decided by the 
Srpska republic's parliament. 
  Asked what the United States would do if the Serbs refused 
the Washington plan, Redman said: "We will be working with all 
sides to reach something that will be accepted and not refused." 
  Although the Serbs were not involved in the first stage of 
negotiations on the plan, they nevertheless, in Redman's words, 
"received some information and were given some documents. We 
hope that in the second phase we will maintain close contacts 
with the Serbs in the same way we have done with the Bosnian 
Government and the Croats," Redman said. 
  In this context he noted that the aim of the first phase was 
to secure an agreement between the Muslims and the Croats, 
whereas in the second phase all three sides must be brought 
together. 
  "What we have done so far was focused on speeding up the 
process leading to a global agreement. It seems to me that now 
we are in a better position to do so. We will continue to be 
actively involved; the United States the European Union, the 
Russian Federation, all three sides in Bosnia, and all countries 
in the region. This will require huge efforts on the part of 
all of us," the special U.S. envoy said. 
  Redman stressed that the peace process must not drag on for 
months. "We are trying to do something within the next few 
weeks," he said. 
  The Bosnian Serb vice president said that the first phase of 
the Washington agreement was about eliminating flash points of 
fighting and establishing a lasting peace. 
  "If you ask yourself what is the essence of the Washington 
agreement between the Muslims and the Croats, the answer is that 
it is the elimination of the flash points of fighting. Sarajevo 
has been eliminated as a flash point of fighting between the 
Serbs and the Muslims. Neum, as a contentious issue between the 
Muslims and Croats, has been removed. Central Bosnia, as a 
fighting flash point, has been eliminated or is in the process 
of being eliminated," Koljevic said. 
  "All moves that are being made are aimed more at achieving 
peace than imposing a solution. We will have to find a 
political solution ourselves," he explained and added that the 
right of a people to participate in this process and to make 
decisions about itself cannot be denied by anyone. 
  Asked if the issue of the Bosnian Serbs joining the Bosnian 
Federation, agreed on by the Croats and Muslims, was discussed, 
Koljevic said that this, as well as the maps and other concrete 
questions, would be discussed in the second phase of the peace 
process. 
  He noted that the Serbs would raise the issue of the lifting 
of sanctions as a precondition for embarking on the second phase 
of the peace process. He recalled that the Serbs had accepted 
the peace plan in Geneva which implied the lifting of sanctions, 
and that everyone but the Muslims agreed to that plan. 
  Koljevic said the lifting of sanctions was linked to the 
peace process and was very important for several reasons, two of 
which were most important: "Only the lifting of sanctions can 
completely discourage the militant groups in the Muslim 
leadership, who are still planning a spring offensive. It would 
also be a signal to the Serbs and Russians that the war flash 
points are not going to spread, and that no military advantages 
are trying to be achieved, but that the intention is really to 
reach peace," Koljevic said. 
  The talks will resume at Sarajevo airport in two days, he 
said. Redman has left Belgrade for Zagreb and is also expected 
to go to Sarajevo.

<F P=106> [Report by Slobodan Jankovic] </F>
  [Text] After his meeting with Serbian President Milosevic, 
U.S. envoy Charles Redman held an hour of talks in Belgrade with 
Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the Srpska republic [of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina]. After this meeting, Redman again denied 
presenting any specific proposals to the Bosnian Serbs. 
Slobodan Jankovic reports: 
  [Jankovic] After the talks, Charles Redman told journalists 
the following: 
  [Begin Redman recording in English with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] I think that Dr. Koljevic and I had 
a very good exchange. We are looking at ways to speed up this 
process and make progress. I think that we agreed that we 
should all take part and be very active in this process, because 
it is high time we saw whether we can reach final (?overall) 
solutions. 
  In the first phase we succeeded in having the Bosnian 
Government and the Croatian representatives sign an agreement. 
We are now entering the second, important phase in which we 
will try to gather together all three sides. What we have done 
has accelerated the process. [end recording] 
  [Jankovic] This was stated by Charles Redman after his talks 
with Nikola Koljevic, announcing that the United States, Russia, 
the European Union, and the three warring factions will continue 
to be involved in all the efforts to find a solution to the war 
in the region. Redman denied presenting any proposals, as he 
did after his talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. 
  Here is now a statement by Nikola Koljevic. 
  [Begin Koljevic recording] I think that this is a positive 
step and, judging from the results, a very pragmatic move, 
without any extreme political conclusions. If you look at the 
sense of what the Muslim and the Croatian sides worked on in 
Washington, you will see that the most important thing was to 
eliminate the hotbeds of war. The war between the Muslims and 
Serbs was halted in Sarajevo. Neum has been eliminated as a 
contentious issue between the Muslims and the Croats. Central 
Bosnia as a hotbed of war has been or is being eliminated. 
  When you take all this into account, you can see that all 
moves are being made in the direction of peace rather than 
imposing a political solution. We will have to find a 
political solution ourselves. Of course, no one can deprive a 
nation of the right to find a political solution itself. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Three parliamentary commissions -- for 
constitutional issues, for foreign relations, and for the 
protection of human rights and freedoms -- at a joint session 
held in Sarajevo today discussed issues concerning 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's future state and legal constitution. 
Merliha Colo reports: 
  [Begins Colo recording] The members of the parliamentary 
commission at today's session discussed the general agreement 
for the formation of a federation on those Bosnia-Herzegovina 
territories with a majority Bosniak and Croatian population, and 
a framework for the preliminary agreement on principles and 
bases for the formation of a confederation between the Republic 
of Croatia and the Bosnian federation. 
  Secretary General of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly [word 
indistinct] Sampara explained the main provisions contained in 
the general agreement on the federation of the Bosniaks, the 
Muslims, and the Croats concerning the structure of the central 
state authorities. 
  The agreement envisages that the assembly of the future 
republic will consist of two chambers -- a chamber of deputies 
and a chamber of peoples. The chamber of deputies will have 120 
seats and will consist of deputies from political parties, while 
the other chamber, the chamber of peoples, is seen as having 90 
deputies -- 30 each from the Croatian and Muslim communities, 
and 30 from other ethnic groups. 
  The president and vice president of the state, as well as 
the 
prime minister and deputy prime minister, would be from each of 
the ethnic groups, while the foreign minister and defense 
minister could not come from the same ethnic group. 
  Several members of the commissions said that the existing 
draft is more generalized that it should have been and, as such, 
does not answer numerous questions concerning the future 
constitutional-legal order of the Bosnian federation as well as 
purely procedural matters, for example, in what manner will the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly and its bodies take part in the 
passing of a future constitution. 
  The presentation by Dr. Haldo Causevic was interesting. He 
pointed at several terminological imprecisions in the agreement 
that create dilemmas and hide legal traps. For example, it is 
not defined whether by forming the new federation, the state and 
legal sovereignty of the existing Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
will be forfeited and whether the new state community will be 
able to inherit its rights. 
  The agreement is also not precise in the part in which it 
outlines the territories of the future state, while the 
territories and the peoples are the two pillars of each state. 
  In deciding about these and other controversial issues, not 
a 
single step further must be made without activating the work of 
the republican assembly, which must adopt a stance toward them, 
it was concluded at today's session of the republican assembly 
commissions. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] A joint control point was set up at the southern 
approaches to Mostar this afternoon, at which UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] members are accompanied by HVO [Croatian 
Defense Council] policemen and members of the Bosnian Muslim 
army. Zdenko Vranjes reports for Croatian radio: 
  [Vranjes] This is the beginning of the implementation of the 
agreement signed yesterday between the commissions of the HVO 
and the Bosnia-Herzegovina army on setting up joint control 
points on the roads crossing the front lines. 
  Representatives of both sides signed maps yesterday with 
precisely outlined demarcation lines between the HVO and the 
Muslim forces. It was also agreed that six main roads be opened 
with unrestricted movement for all civilians, except for men 
between the ages of 16 and 60. It was also agreed that the 
following roads be opened: Zenica-Stari Vitez, 
Mostar-Jablanica-Konjic-Sarajevo, Kiseljak-Vares, 
Kiseljak-Busovaca, Prozor-Jablanica-Gornji Vakuf- Travnik, and 
Vitez-Zenica-Maglaj. 
  According to the Spanish UNPROFOR battalion, the HVO and the 
Muslim army have withdrawn their heavy weapons. Mortars have 
been withdrawn 10 kms and tanks and heavy guns 20 kms from the 
front line. [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 9 March within its 
regular 11-minute newscast carries several reports on the 
situation in the Republic. 
  In his report from the Bihac region, Mirza Sadikovic says 
that "the Serbian aggressor forces' offensive on the Bihac 
region has entered its second month with unabated ferocity. The 
past 24 hours have been marked by constant aggressor's artillery 
operations on the outskirts of the Bihac and Cazin communes. 
Yesterday afternoon and last night, howitzers and mortars 
targeted the Cazin region more. The situation along the defense 
lines was as usual: With the activity with Bofors weapons, 
[word indistinct], (?machine-guns), mortars of all kinds, and an 
increased sniper activity on Grabez, (Hasin Vrh), and 
Grmusko-Srbljanski Height, the Chetniks marked last night and 
the morning so far. In this period, a dozen people were 
seriously or lightly wounded. The Serbian aggressors acted 
along the lines of the fighters of the Croatian Defense Council 
[HVO] of the Bihac region, particularly in the Pljesevica region 
and shelled parts of Veliki Skocaj." 
  A report by the Press Center of the Maglaj Commune War 
Presidency read by an unidentified correspondent says that 
"yesterday and this morning on the Maglaj battlefield there has 
been a strange lull with only occasional artillery provocations 
along the entire line of separation and sniper activity on [word 
indistinct] in the northern part of the city. However, the visit 
by [Serbian Republic Presidency Member Biljana] Plavsic and 
Mirko Jovic [chairman of the Serbian National Defense] to Ozren, 
as well as an intensive concentration and regrouping of manpower 
and artillery pieces around Maglaj, harbinger a continuation of 
even fiercer attacks on the city soon." 
  A partly indistinct report by a Press Center of the 3d Corps 
says that "shots fired from the HVO positions in the zone 
covered by the 3d Corps can be counted on the fingers of one 
hand. A sniper is heard from time to time, as was the case in 
Stari Vitez. A mortar bomb fell on (Busovaca) [word 
indistinct]. These were incidents that failed to seriously 
threaten the truce. 
  "However, the Chetniks have not been calm. At 2030 last 
night, they fired seven howitzer shells from (Zmetan) on 
Travnik. On the Zavidovici battlefield [word indistinct] and 
Karaula, Chetniks opened fire from antiaircraft weapons. In the 
Bugojno region, they occasionally acted with infantry weapons. 
At about 0800 this morning, a general danger alarm was sounded 
in Zenica. Three shells were launched from the Chetnik 
strongholds on Vlasic. According to reports so far, two people 
have been lightly injured. 
  "Prisoners were exchanged yesterday between the Army of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the HVO in the region of 
Zepce. Seventeen Croatian fighters were released by our side, 
while 31 fighters of our army left Zepce."

  [Text] We have just received the letter sent by the 
president of our country's Presidency Alija Izetbegovic to 
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. It reads as follows: 
  Dear Sir: 
  In connection with your government's decision to deny 
further 
hospitality to the citizens of the so-called Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, we wish to draw your attention to the fact that its 
literal implementation could do a great injustice to certain 
members of our nation. Namely, this decision also applies to 
Muslim refugees from Sandzak who, as your excellency knows all 
too well, have been the target of brutal repression by the 
Belgrade regime. Those from Sandzak had to flee their homes due 
to open police terror and also because they refused to be 
mobilized by the Serbian army and to be forced to commit crimes 
against the Croats and later against their brethren in Bosnia. 
To our knowledge, most of these people in Germany today hail 
from the municipalities of Novi Pazar, Sjenica, Tutin, Rozaje, 
Bijelo Polje, Berane, Prijepolje, Priboj, Nova Varos, Plevlja, 
and Plav. 
  I am pleading with you, Sir, to exempt these unfortunate 
people from the decision on deportation, because they simply 
have nowhere to return. They would be sent to prison or, worse, 
to the front in Bosnia or Croatia the minute they crossed the 
border, President Izetbegovic wrote in his letter to Klaus 
Kinkel.

  [Text] Washington, March 8 (TANJUG) -- United Nations 
experts have established that Moslems were responsible for the 
explosion at a Sarajevo market in early February, TANJUG learned 
from usually well-informed American circles. 
  The sources said that two officers of the U.N. commission, 
one from Great Britain and one from Belgium, independently came 
to the conclusion that the shell had been fired from the Moslem 
side. 
  The ballistics experts sent the report to the U.N. 
Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR), but the document apparently got side-tracked 
somewhere along the way, the sources said. The sources told 
TANJUG that the White House also had a copy of this report. 
  The French television network TF-1 recently broadcast a 
report by its New York correspondent which mentioned the 
UNPROFOR report blaming the Moslems for the massacre. The 
official UNPROFOR report on the massacre, which killed 68 
civilians and wounded around 200 according to Moslem media, said 
that it was not possible to establish the guilty party. 
  THE WASHINGTON POST said on Tuesday that the shell which 
caused the massacre at the Sarajevo market, judging from its 
effects, could have come from the Moslem side. This article is 
the first of its kind in a major U.S. newspaper which even 
allows for the possibility that Bosnian Serbs were not 
responsible for the massacre. 
  The massacre triggered NATO to issue an ultimatum and demand 
that Bosnian Serbs and Moslems withdraw or place under UNPROFOR 
control their heavy weapons in and around Sarajevo or face air 
strikes. Western politicians and media, however, interpreted 
this as an ultimatum and threat to Serbs, urging only them to 
honour the NATO ultimatum.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Soljic, newly appointed defense </F>
minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, by Mario 
Marusic; place and date not given: "The Soldiers Do Not Mind 
`The Herzegovinian Lobby'"] 
  [Text] With the many changes that have occurred in the 
Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna in the past month -- including 
that concerning the establishment of the Presidential Council, 
which, in the established state of emergency and until further 
notice, is to carry out the duties of president instead of Mate 
Boban -- public attention was particularly aroused by the 
appointment of Vladimir Soljic, the former minister of energy, 
mining, and industry, to the position of defense minister. We 
talked to him about the present situation in Herceg-Bosna, the 
tasks of the ministry of defense, the Croat negotiating 
position, the future of the Croats of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
many other issues. 
<H5>  A Long Chess Game </H5>
  [Marusic] Mr. Soljic, there have been many changes following 
the session in Livno, Herceg-Bosna. Do these only concern new 
people who should improve the former positions, or a fundamental 
change of Croatian policies in and toward Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Soljic] Many reporters attended the session of the Chamber 
of Representatives in Livno, and public reports of the 
Presidential Council sessions and the sessions of the Government 
of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna are regularly issued. 
There are no other facts whereby I could give a more complete 
answer to your question than what the aforementioned bodies have 
already said about it. I see this whole issue as a chess game 
that will be played for a long time, and I cannot give a final 
assessment on the basis of one or several moves. The basic aims 
of the policies of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, I 
believe, Croatian politics as well, will not be questioned. The 
Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina can be certain that every inch of 
Croat land is taken into consideration, as is each Croat in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it is simply impossible to satisfy each 
individual interest here -- as not all Russians will live in 
Russia, all Germans in Germany, or all Serbs in Serbia, so not 
all Croats will live in the Republic of Croatia or in the Croat 
republic of Herceg-Bosna, but, with the existence of the Croat 
state and the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, the freedom and 
the rights of all the Croats outside these areas will be 
guaranteed. We will achieve the maximum possible in this 
situation. 
  [Marusic] Let us summarize: The Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna (after all) remains the foundation-stone of 
Croatian policies in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Soljic] That is our orientation, and it will not change. 
There is no sovereignty without territory. 
  [Marusic] Nevertheless, many, particularly the opposition, 
which has been especially hard on the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna policies, have assessed the placing of Boban's 
mandate "at the disposal of the present" as the defeat and ruin 
of a policy -- the policy of the "Herzegovinian lobby," as they 
like to say. Mr. Budisa's [president of the Croatian Social 
Liberal Party] comment was that "the Herzegovinians do not 
realize that Yugoslavia has fallen to ruins, but that they will 
still not live in Croatia." 
  [Soljic] I would like to send all those who disagree with 
the policies of Herceg-Bosna, and who question this idea, to 
central Bosnia, so that they can ask the Croats there if they 
support Herceg-Bosna and if they mind the "Herzegovinian lobby." 
As far as Budisa's statement is concerned, it is possible that 
Herzegovinians will not be in Croatia -- it is one of the 
realistic variants. However, if the Croatian state exists, they 
will be freer than they have ever been. Otherwise, the 
positions of part of the opposition is quite unfair, whenever 
the Croats in Herceg-Bosna are at issue. If they do not 
appreciate the contribution of the Croats of Herceg- Bosna and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to the fact that the Croatian state exists, 
and that it will exist, then there is nothing to discuss there. 
We have shown how much we love Croatia at the referendum, when 
we simply voted against our common sense -- for Bosnia- 
Herzegovina, just so that Croatia could exist. It is sad that 
whoever does not bear that in mind, appreciate and respect it, 
should declare themselves a Croat. 
  [Marusic] You have been elected defense minister from among 
very strong competition. Certain circles were somewhat 
surprised by your nomination. What is your position on that, 
and what is the truth about your appointment to the position of 
defense minister? Can a successful businessperson be a 
successful defense minister? 
  [Soljic] I would not like to talk about the reasons for my 
appointment -- those who elected me should talk about that. I 
can only say that I am honored. Both those who held this 
position before me, and those who could have been appointed 
instead of me are people who are implementing a program. I am 
certain that I will find a way to have all of them help me in 
carrying out this task, which, at the moment, is the most 
important one for all of us. I belong to neither a formal 
party, nor to any non-formal group. I do not agree with any 
division of Croats on a regional or any other basis, other than 
that concerning whether a person supports our general policies, 
whether they work and want to work, and nothing else. The 
answer to the second part of your question is yes -- I will do 
my best, and let others talk about the results. If I or someone 
else decides that I am not carrying out my duties 
satisfactorily, there will be ways of solving that. I will 
accept it as reality, because any job in politics is a seasonal 
one: Everyone who is elected will either be replaced, or their 
mandate will expire. 

<H5>    More Rights Than the Mojahedin </H5>
  [Marusic] What do you intend to do when you begin your 
duties -- will you start from where your predecessor left off, 
or with something completely new? What has not worked so far, 
and how should it be corrected? 
  [Soljic] I never start from the assumption that the world 
starts with me, and I respect what has been done well, but I 
will try to improve what has not been done well. Reorganization 
is under way, and I believe we will complete it successfully. I 
do not want to analyze the causes of certain mistakes -- I can 
only say that many of them were made for objective reasons -- 
from entering the fight spontaneously to certain people growing 
tired and the fighting becoming complicated.... I cannot say 
that it has been bad, it is just that the circumstances have 
changed, and a new organization needs to be found for the new 
circumstances, for which we will need new people. 
  [Marusic] How do you view the frequent accusations in the 
past several months concerning open military involvement of the 
HVO in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Soljic] I have not met either a formation or an individual 
whose superior is anyone other than myself. Defending the 
territories of Herceg-Bosna is the moral right of the citizens 
of the Republic of Croatia -- our citizens did the same at the 
beginning of the war in Croatia. However, we are not asking 
them to, and we will not do so, because there is no need. There 
are enough Croats who are originally from Herceg-Bosna and want 
to come to Herceg-Bosna from Croatia and defend their homeland. 
They have much more right to do so than, for instance, the 
Mojahedin. Let the same hold for us and the others. 
  [Marusic] What are the chances of peace in Mostar? Whose 
city will it be, and what about the establishment of a 
protectorate? 
  [Soljic] For, when the question arises what the capital of 
the "Serb republic" is, or what the capital of the Muslim people 
is, there are not many dilemmas, I would like to ask everyone 
who has a different opinion what the capital of the Croats in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina is indeed. There is no other possible 
answer than the city of Mostar, since the Croats, too, have the 
right to a city that has a university, an airport, and the rest 
of the city infrastructure. Therefore, Mostar will remain the 
capital of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. As far as 
concerns the citizens of Mostar who are of Serb or Muslim 
nationality, I believe that Mostar can offer them more as 
capital of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna than as a city in 
any other republic. We will try to find a satisfactory solution 
for the coexistence of all three peoples in these areas. There 
will be no coexistence on the basis of brotherhood and unity, 
but only on the basis of partnership. In all this, the 
establishment of a protectorate represents another goodwill 
gesture on the part of the Croats. 
  [Marusic] Lately there have been many meetings of the Croat 
and Muslim representatives (Frankfurt, Washington), and the 
ceasefire agreement has been signed by generals Roso and Delic. 
However, reports from the ground still talk of new Muslim 
attacks. 
  [Soljic] There have been many cease-fire agreements. 
Judging by experience, I am not sure this signature will be the 
right one. Nevertheless, one cease-fire must be the right one. 
However, the situation in which there are three players is very 
complicated, and in these areas there is also the conflict of 
interest of the superpowers and the neighboring countries. Try 
as we might, it is not only up to us to decide. However, much 
depends on our power. There is no such criterion, if applied the 
same way to all, that would leave the Croats unsatisfied. The 
Croats simply never had the intention to take what does not 
belong to them. 
  [Marusic] Under the pressure of the United States, the 
existence of Bosnia-Herzegovina is viewed exclusively through 
the alliance of Croats and Muslims. It seems that the 
international community is prepared to acknowledge the results 
of the Serb aggression. Do you believe in the restoration of 
the Croat-Muslim alliance? 
  [Soljic] Generally speaking, it is wrong to talk of a single 
solution in politics. As far as the international community is 
concerned, it simply recognizes force or power to a greater or 
lesser extent, and this will be the case with the results of the 
Serb aggression. That is certain already. It will perhaps not 
be to the extent the Serbs expect, but as soon as aggression is 
acknowledged, it is a bad sign. Regarding the latest proposals 
for a federation/confederacy, I think that the representatives 
of the Croat people will be able to find a satisfactory 
solution. Indeed, when there is a war, it is difficult to 
discuss an alliance or friendship. However, a way will have to 
be found of living one next to another, or one with another -- 
that is a matter of politics. The Croat experience of life in a 
community has mostly been bad. However, I think that a way will 
be found that will suit the Croat people best and that is 
possible in this situation. 
<H5>  We Will Stop All Offensives </H5>
  [Marusic] If these peace initiatives fail, it is certain 
that in the next few weeks the great spring Muslim offensive, 
which has been announced, will follow. Will the HVO be able to 
defend the Croat territories if this offensive occurs? 
  [Soljic] There should be no doubt about the defense of the 
Croat territories. We were able to stop one of the most 
powerful armies with hunting guns and tanks at Siroki Brijeg 
with our bare hands, and there should be no doubt about whether 
we can stop a Muslim offensive. We are certainly capable of 
doing so. The weakness that occurred at the beginning of the 
conflict with the Muslims, when we entered it unprepared for a 
classic Muslim betrayal, cannot happen again. The Croat people 
can be certain that these territories will be defended.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina </F>
Presidency, by Zdravka Soldic; place and date not given: "The 
Croats Are at Home in Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency, is probably the most media-exposed 
Bosnia-Herzegovina government official, always prepared to make 
statements and give interviews. Many say he is Alija 
Izetbegovic's right hand. However, circles close to the 
authorities report that he is close to Izetbegovic primarily due 
to the fact that he is best acquainted with military 
technological potential and its possible applications. They say: 
"Izetbegovic needs Ganic, but Izetbegovic is afraid Ganic will 
seize power. Ganic makes many decisions on his own, without 
consulting with anyone." 
  The inhabitants of Sarajevo have different opinions about 
Ganic. Some think he is capable and necessary, especially at a 
time like this, and that he must be given more authority and 
competence. Others recall his Sandzak origin and ekavian dialect 
[dialect spoken in Serbia proper], the fact that he entered the 
presidency as the representative of the Yugoslavs, and that he 
does not observe strict fasting during Ramadan. 
  We could notice he does not fast during Ramadan when he 
received us in the building of the Presidency. He had coffee 
and juice with us at the time of the day when that is forbidden 
by the Koran. 
  Ganic is a skillful diplomat. He tries to forget to give the 
answer to every sensitive question. 
  Since, in the past couple of days, the most topical issue 
was 
the agreement on cessation of hostilities between the Croats and 
the Muslims and the negotiations in Washington on the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, we began this interview by 
talking about that. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
<H5>  I Barely Managed To Stay Alive </H5>
  [Soldic] Mr. Ganic, this is the 14th or the 15th agreement 
on the cessation of hostilities between the Croats and the 
Muslims. What do you think are the prospects of this agreement? 
  [Ganic] Its prospects are good. We took all political and 
military steps for its implementation. We are creating a 
climate on the ground for this agreement to be respected. A 
couple of minutes ago, I talked to commanding officers on the 
phone. They confirmed that results are excellent on the ground. 
  [Soldic] Who took the initiative to sign the agreement? 
  [Ganic] You see, the climate has been created by all sides. 
We have held many talks, made many agreements. We have always 
wanted to stop fighting. It was not logical to fight against 
the Croats. But we also knew we were not fighting the entire 
Croatian nation, but merely a faction of the Croats. The 
inhabitants of Dubrovnik, people in Dalmatia, Istria, Zagreb, 
Slavonia have always advocated Bosnia. Unfortunately, we could 
not establish a proper dialogue with the Herzegovinians. I am 
the first politician from Bosnia-Herzegovina who visited the 
Croat village of Ravno, near Trebinje, when it was destroyed, 
and not a single Herzegovinian politician set foot in the 
village for days. 
  [Soldic] Since you mentioned Ravno, the president of the 
Presidency has often been reproached for not having reacted 
properly at the time when the village was attacked. 
  [Ganic] I went to visit the village the day it was attacked. 
No one in the Croatian press will mention that. They recorded 
it with television cameras as well as the statement I gave in 
Ravno. I said: "This is terrible." The village was completely 
destroyed. I was stunned. I barely managed to stay alive. 
  [Soldic] But for some three or four days, President 
Izetbegovic did not make any statement and a part of his 
territory was attacked. 
  [Ganic] I went there and made a statement. 
  [Soldic] Who proposed the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Croats and the Muslims? 
  [Ganic] We proposed the federation several months ago in 
Zagreb, during the session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency 
I presided over. Do you remember the session of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency in Zagreb? We kept making that 
proposal. And then the United States and Germany said: "That 
proposal is not bad at all." It was planned, first of all, to 
reach an agreement between the Croats and the Muslims. If the 
Serbs do not agree to the confederation, then we will see what 
they want. They cannot just take away a part of the territory. 
If they want to leave Bosnia-Herzegovina, then that opens a 
series of other problems. 
  [Soldic] If the Bosnia-Herzegovina borders should change, 
will you demand the annexation of Sandzak? 
  [Ganic] If the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina should change, 
there would be another 150 countries demanding the same. And 
that is why Europe never allowed changing borders. If borders 
should nevertheless be changed, we would demand the integrity of 
the country. Why should we not enter the belly of the Serbs, if 
they are doing the same to us. However, it will not come to 
that. Sandzak will get the same kind of autonomy as the Serbs in 
Knin. 
  [Soldic] Do you think it is realistic to expect a federation 
with the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Is it possible to impose 
that on Milosevic and Karadzic? On the other hand, I do not see 
a political party in Serbia that could seize power and change 
the relation toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Ganic] Milosevic and Karadzic are, first of all, people who 
have tens of millions of dollars. You must be aware of that. 
On the other hand, when Milosevic feels the pressure, Karadzic 
is gone for a couple of hours. If the international community 
should simultaneously adhere to the principle which persecutes 
criminals of war, then Karadzic would automatically be put on 
trial. The Serbs can obey perfectly when they have to. 
<H5>  The Serbs Must Be Stretched Out </H5>
  [Soldic] How do you interpret the change of political course 
of the international community toward Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Ganic] Great Britain has supported the Serbs from the 
start. To some extent, the French have supported Great Britain 
in that, so as to hinder the growing influence of Germany in 
this region. Actually, that is a very primitive concept: 
Slobodan Milosevic was found to create a chaos here, so that 
this part of Europe would not merge with Asia and so that 
Germany would not dominate over it. However, tolerating a 
fascist like Milosevic, with the project of greater Serbia, 
resulted in another fascist with the project of greater Russia. 
That made the French change their politics. This is a global 
aberration. Serbia has crossed the Drina. The Drina River has 
always been a border. The United States suggested Great Britain 
should support the change of concept toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
I expect to see better days for Bosnia. 
  [Soldic] Lately, one often hears that, in addition to 
political support of the United States, Bosnia also gets 
substantial financial aid. 
  [Ganic] I do not want to comment on that. After all, the 
United States defends the consistency of its policies in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. In my opinion, they have made a good 
political move. They first left it up to Europe to solve the 
problem of Bosnia. As is now obvious, the Europeans can not or 
will not do that, so the United States decided to get more 
actively involved. You can see that from the Sarajevo ultimatum 
and from the support to the proposal about Bosnia-Herzegovina 
federation. 
  [Soldic] Does Bosnia-Herzegovina, apart from political 
support, get any financial support from Islamic countries? 
  [Ganic] We get significant financial aid. 
  [Soldic] The NATO ultimatum about Sarajevo did not prove to 
be determined enough, it seems. The Serbs have not withdrawn 
their weapons, not everything has been put under the control of 
the UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces], and there were 
no air strikes after all. 
  [Ganic] This is nevertheless the biggest move since the 
beginning of the war. I am sure they will be more decisive in 
future, as we could see this time. 
  [Soldic] The inhabitants of Sarajevo say the UNPROFOR is to 
blame for the fact that the NATO plan has not been implemented 
to the full. And you made a statement on Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Television after the ultimatum expired that you were not 
satisfied with the work of the UNPROFOR. 
  [Ganic] They are to blame for having tolerated the Serbs, 
who did not do anything for eight days. And when they did get 
around to doing it, they could not manage to complete it in two 
days. The UNPROFOR always supports the stronger side. And they 
always have the same excuse -- that they do not have enough 
soldiers. They did not need Russian soldiers who proved in 
Croatia that they are not neutral. But we gave a clear message 
to Russian soldiers. They should think twice before they do 
anything next time. 
  [Soldic] The Sarajevo model of disarming the warring 
factions is soon to be applied in Tuzla, Mostar, and Vitez. Can 
the same model be applied to those other areas as well? How 
"soon" will that be? 
  [Ganic] It can be applied in some towns. However, it is not 
such a good solution for others. Resolution No. 836, which was 
adopted before, is better. It includes the withdrawal of heavy 
artillery and the withdrawal of the Serbian army. But they get 
panicky even when they must only withdraw their heavy artillery. 
This war of Serbia is actually the war of artillery against 
civilians. In Sarajevo they say: "You are safest at the front 
line with soldiers." And that is the weakness of that regime. 
That is why we must not yield to the Serbs, for no such army 
has ever won a war. And that is why I have always said that the 
Serbs must be stretched out. But the Presidency is a collective 
body and we must coordinate our views. 
<H5>  We Are Opening Roads in Central Bosnia </H5>
  [Soldic] The Croatian media broadcast your statement which 
announced that you would clean central Bosnia. 
  [Ganic] With regard to central Bosnia, your media often 
broadcast things that were not said. I said we would open roads 
in central Bosnia and seize key positions which will enable our 
army to function. We managed to do that. We connected Bugojno 
to Travnik, Travnik to Zenica. We were fighting for Vitez. In 
a way, it was a battle for communications. Why do we control 
Fojnica? Because we go to Zenica from Fojnica via Konjic. From 
Zenica, we go to Tuzla via Vares. We had to have that 
communication route. 
  [Soldic] How come that, in a couple of months, you conquered 
several towns controlled by the HVO? 
  [Ganic] Vares was besieged to the extent that it was 
impossible to defend it. 
  [Soldic] Did you make any agreements with the HVO to 
withdraw? 
  [Ganic] No, believe me. There were no agreements. Vares 
was completely surrounded. We had the 2d Corps, the forces of 
the 1st and 3d Corps. It was impossible to defend Vares. They 
managed to get out, but they were wrong in dragging the people 
along. We demanded that UNPROFOR enter Vares as soon as 
possible. We asked Monsignor Puljic to go to Vares and stop 
people from getting out. We kept fighting against ethnic 
cleansing. Boban had very little feeling for the Croats from 
central Bosnia. 
  [Soldic] Why did you attack Vares? 
  [Ganic] The Chetniks were coming into town from the hills. 
They came to do their shopping, and we had to pay for passage 
from Zenica to Tuzla. 
  [Soldic] Fojnica? 
  [Ganic] We had to liberate Fojnica. There was a problem 
regarding communications. 
  [Soldic] Bugojno? Who began first? 
  [Ganic] In the beginning, we fought together against the 
Chetniks. The Army was better organized and the HVO withdrew 
after a couple of days of fighting. 
  [Soldic] Konjic, Travnik? 
  [Ganic] We had the 17th Krajina brigade there, which is very 
strong. They liberated Travnik from the HVO in a flash. And 
commands were very strange too. Some units fought to the end 
and some simply withdrew. But the Croats also had the dilemma 
as to why they were fighting. The HVO has never had a clear 
program regarding their goals in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Boban 
wanted a state for himself. 
  [Soldic] Was Vitez attacked because of the territory or 
because of the explosives factory controlled by the HVO? 
Military experts who are well acquainted with military 
technology of that factory (both the one before the war as well 
as today's) say that those explosives cannot be used for 
weapons, that those explosives can only be used in civil 
engineering. Can they also be used for military purposes? 
  [Ganic] Before the war, I returned from the United States 
and took over the development of UNIS. UNIS was the largest 
manufacturer of weapons and military equipment in former 
Yugoslavia. I founded military and technological institute. The 
production has been going on for years and documentation was 
kept in Belgrade. I was chosen to buy technology for the 
factory in Vitez. I know exactly what they have. 
  [Soldic] Then tell me, can the explosives in Vitez be used 
for military purposes? Can they be used for making mortars? 
  [Ganic] There are two factories there: "Vitezit" and the 
"SPS." There are two possibilities. The HVO exaggerated the 
importance of that factory. The factory should not be destroyed 
for other reasons. Because there are certain standards. The 
story that it cannot be destroyed is a fairy tale. The way they 
think, they could not destroy it. [paragraph as published] 
<H5>  Boban Made a Deal With Karadzic </H5>
  [Soldic] Why was there fighting in central Bosnia? 
  [Ganic] There was fighting in central Bosnia because Boban 
made an agreement with Karadzic to tie our forces so as to 
prevent us from advancing toward the Chetniks. But, on the 
other hand, also because he wanted to create a state within a 
state. He wanted to separate a part of Bosnia. Both our and 
Croatian forces were involved at the wrong place. And the Serbs 
took advantage of that. They say that Croat-Muslim conflicts are 
the "sweet part of the news." That is a strategic mistake, but 
it is never too late. The Croats desire to return to Bosanska 
Posavina, central Bosnia -- all who went away are welcome back. 
The Croats have two countries: Croatia and Bosnia. But Bosnia 
does not only belong to the Croats, but also to the Bosniaks, 
the Muslims, and the Serbs. But it is senseless to risk the 
existence of both countries. If you divide Bosnia, it would be 
difficult to convince the Serbs in Knin not to demand the same. 
Realizing the concept of the federation of the Muslims and the 
Croats, which would include Posavina and the Drina basin, would 
leave the Serbs from Knin without arguments. 
  [Soldic] In Croatia, they say that Komsic and Kljuic are 
just puppets in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, that they 
make no decisions, and only serve Izetbegovic to show to the 
world that his presidency is organized on the principle of 
national parity. However, I have read some statements by both 
Komsic and Kljuic, released a couple of months ago, and they 
said there was no discussion nor voting about the offensive 
against Vares, or about the transformation of the HVO in 
Sarajevo. 
  [Ganic] You see, when he became a member of the Presidency, 
Komsic started working very hard. Kljuic was a member of the 
Presidency, then he resigned, and then got back to the 
Presidency in a different way. They participate in making 
decisions, although I must admit that in the beginning, when the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army was being created, most important 
decisions were indeed made by President Izetbegovic and myself. 
Those who work are influential in the Presidency. Those who do 
not do any work, do not get to make any decisions. Today, I had 
to commit myself on the arrival of more Russian soldiers to 
Sarajevo. I said 400 was more than enough. I took that 
political risk and am responsible for that. 
  [Soldic] Stjepan Siber is no longer deputy commander of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Did he resign or was he replaced? 
  [Ganic] His wife became ill. He went to Switzerland for 
treatment. He asked to accompany her. He now works for our 
diplomatic service. 
  [Soldic] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army mobilizes the Sarajevo 
Croats to fight against the Croats in central Bosnia. I think 
that the Army and the Presidency ought to show some 
consideration for this very sensitive situation. 
  [Ganic] I can safely claim that those units that surrounded 
Vitez had an insignificant percentage of the Croats. The Croats 
were mostly sent toward the north to Tuzla. But, believe me, 
some Croats advocate Bosnia, and they are first of all Bosnians 
and then Croats. Eighty heroes, young Croats, gave their lives 
for Sarajevo. That will never be forgotten. The Croats have 
made a significant contribution in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. 
<H5>  Zelic Should Be Put on Public Trial </H5>
  [Soldic] During a couple of days I stayed in Sarajevo, I 
heard many Croats say they feel like second-rate citizens. Do 
they fear for their physical and existential survival? 
  [Ganic] It is possible there were some isolated incidents, 
but as far as global politics is concerned, the Croats are at 
home here. They enjoy the same rights as other nations. Bishop 
Puljic is here from the beginning of the war. We must respect 
that. The Croats did much for development and culture both 
before and during the war. One should not make statistics on the 
basis of isolated incidents. We made an analysis of theft and 
murders in Sarajevo. The Muslims were killed in 90 percent of 
the cases. 
  [Soldic] Why is Slavko Zelic in prison? 
  [Ganic] They say he was doing what was forbidden. Kljuic 
visited him in prison. I would like his to be a public trial. 
Come and inform your public why Slavko Zelic is put on trial. 
Among other things, he wanted to act in Sarajevo following 
instructions from Mate Boban of Grude. 
  [Soldic] In conclusion, can we say that you think Bosnia is 
not a state which is disappearing, but a state in the making? 
  [Ganic] Bosnia is a state which is recovering.

<F P=106> [Commentary by V. Cvetkovska: "Merchandise Worth $1 Billion </F>
Passes Through Thessaloniki"] 
  [Text] The Greek embargo on transit of goods from and to 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
forced Macedonian economists to obtain their first evaluations 
and reviews on current and future damages resulting from the 
unilateral blockade. 
  The first general evaluation of the Macedonian Chamber of 
Commerce assesses that, besides damages to some companies' 
already agreed import-export deals, the southern blockade will 
cause direct stoppages in the economy: in production in some 
economic sectors due to the impossibility of getting supplies, 
but also in disposing of the goods. Lowered productivity 
because of this situation threaten to put a complete halt to the 
energetic industry and production based on raw materials, 
particularly those that will be incapable of solving the 
problems caused by additional costs for alternative 
transportation routes. The economists were unanimous, at the 
last assembly of the Macedonian Chamber of Commerce, in their 
demand to the government to request urgent permission from the 
UN Sanctions Committee for a transport corridor through the rump 
Yugoslavia, because, as the economists said, other alternatives 
are only temporary solutions that will cause additional 
expenditures and damages. The annual balance of foreign trade 
goods delivered through Thessaloniki Harbor reveals that the 
value of export-import deals and transit amounts to around $1 
billion, and separate analyses on damages to the economy, 
energy, metallurgy, metal, chemical, leather, and construction 
materials industries, as well as railway traffic, addresses the 
fact that, aside from the basic damages caused by the unilateral 
blockade, companies must also calculate damages generated from 
alternative routes that will have a final impact on their 
production process. In the energy sector, negative influences 
in petrol supplies and derivatives, coke, coal, and other raw 
materials, are expected. Based on the country's energy reserves 
for 1994, it was planned to provide 1,100 metric tons of petrol 
derivatives, and there are presently 52,000 tons of petrol being 
held in Thessaloniki Harbor, amounting to $7 million. The 
alternative direction crossing Albania is not the best choice 
because of the small storehouses, but also because of the 
limited transportation possibilities, thus the refinery will be 
able to keep up the process of production only if railway 
transportation across the territory of the rump Yugoslavia is 
opened, as this would facilitate petrol transportation from 
Bulgarian harbors. Increased transportation expenditures, this 
sector warned, will be reflected in petrol and derivative 
prices, which will be most directly felt in the economy and 
citizens through their consumer goods. In order to avoid these 
high prices, besides the transportation corridor across the rump 
Yugoslavia, it is indispensable to diminish expenditures in the 
derivatives production process. The sector most affected by the 
Greek blockade is the metal-working industry, which realizes 80 
percent of its exports through Thessaloniki Harbor, and 60 
percent of raw materials are supplied from that direction. The 
first evaluations of this sector's companies are that they will 
have to spend an additional $20 million if they are forced to 
transport their goods across other areas, such as Burgas and 
Drac. Only the Skopje Iron Factory has to import goods worth $84 
million from Thessaloniki Harbor and export 340,000 tons of 
goods worth $106 million. The iron factory finds that 
transportation alternatives across Bulgaria and Albania are 
suitable only for small quantities, therefore it will not be 
able to keep up even a minimum level of production. Jugohrom has 
to import $5 million worth of goods, and import 14,500 tons of 
raw materials worth $2.3 million, in the first quarter of the 
year. Alternative transportation routes will add $1 million in 
extra costs for the first three months; therefore they are 
planning to reduce production to 50 percent in case the blockade 
remains. 
  The 11 October Tractor company from Kumanovo had signed a 
deal with a Greek partner for $26 million (the water supply 
project for Greece), and since there is no other alternative 
than pipeline transport, the whole project might "fall into the 
water." The mines of Zletovo and Bucim are also expecting 
additional expenditures for the supply of raw materials, and the 
Alumina factory will be charged $3.4 million extra for 
alternative transportation routes. The metal and electrical 
industries will have to pay $3.1 million additional for 
alternative transportation across Burgas, Varna, Drac, and 
Istanbul, and the two "FAM" [not further specified] deals with a 
Japanese company and Korea, Egypt, and Iraq will cost them 
additional $140,000. The situation in EMO-Ohrid is similar, and 
by the end of the year damages will amount to $500,000. OHIS, 
which succeeded in finding new markets in Asian countries, will 
have to increase its costs by 50 percent, and this chemical 
giant has raw materials in the amount of $400,000 being held up 
in Thessaloniki Harbor, alongside 13 tons of goods worth 
$12,600. "Hemteks" was forced to stop production because it 
couldn't get hold of raw materials held hostage on a ship in 
Thessaloniki, worth 1 million German marks. 
<H5>  No Alternative </H5>
  "Strumicanka" will face the most irreconcilible situation in 
the textile branch; its production and distribution is 90 
percent oriented to Greek companies, which will engender damages 
of $12 million. "Makedonka" from Stip will experience damages 
of $2.7 million because it also has made import-export deals 
with Greek partners. Knitted fabric companies have 100 tons of 
knitting materials worth $600,000 held up in Thessaloniki 
Harbor, and "Prespateks" from Resen has 33 tons of knitting and 
other materials worth $200,000 being held up. The 
leather-working sector has been affected by a blockade from two 
sides, according to the chamber's observations. There are 18 
containers of Australian leather for the needs of "Godel" and 
"Dimko Mitrev" valued at $300,000 and assembly firms that have 
made deals will have to pay 30 to 40 percent more for 
alternative transportation. 
  Railway transportation, according to the findings of the 
Skopje Railway Transport company, will experience monthly losses 
of $8 million, and by the end of the year damages will amount to 
$80 million, while public cargo transportation losses are 
calculated at 14 million German marks. The transportation 
companies are multiplying their expenditures by three from the 
very start, and the opinion is that the alternative transport 
through Albania is almost impossible, because it is difficult to 
negotiate and cooperate with them. This problem has been 
stressed in particular by the Tehnomental-Vardar, Inteks, 
Gradinar Lozar, and Javor companies from Bitola, because, as 
they say, it will have negative repercussions not only on trade, 
but also on supplies for domestic producers. 
  These circumstances have compelled economists to be 
unanimous 
in their request for opening the northern corridor (transit 
across the rump Yugoslavia), and they asked the government to 
persist in that. The Bulgarians have already fought for that, 
although only for humanitarian products. Although economists do 
not give up the idea of constructing an east-west corridor 
(Albania-Bulgaria-Turkey); still the most convenient solution 
for our economy is to open the transit to the north, regardless 
of how much more expensive it might be (its opening is expected 
to cause new transit prices) -- nevertheless, it does not have 
an alternative as a transit point for some products and sectors.

<F P=106> [Commentary by S. Jovanovska: "Greek List of Wishes"] </F>
  [Text] In agreement with the folk proverb "The hungry 
dream of full plates," our neighbor, Greece, is once again 
sending us dramatic announcements. These range from the 
announcement that this week will be conclusive for the 
Macedonian-Greek negotiations, that mediator Vance has already 
prepared a memorandum that Skopje and Athens have to support, 
that Delors and Van den Broek have prepared their "formulas" for 
solving the crisis after the Greek closure of the borders, that 
the European mediator will again visit Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], to a possible meeting 
between Papoulias and Crvenkovski in Brussels or Geneva. 
  According to what we could learn from reliable Macedonian 
sources, nothing can be expected from all these dramatic 
announcements. That is to say, there is no Vance memorandum and 
Macedonia has not been informed of it, and even laymen can be 
assured by reading between the lines that it is comparable to a 
Greek list of wishes and another testing "balloon" for us and 
the European Union. According to the mentioned memorandum, 
Macedonia should agree to withdraw the symbols [Star of Vergina 
on FYROM flag], alter the Constitution where it deals with care 
for the minorities abroad, and guarantee the borders -- all as a 
precondition for placing the name issue under international 
arbitration. This had no chance hitherto, and the Macedonian 
side was never asked directly to do that. In return, Greece 
should lift the embargo and the "veto" from the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, from the European Union, and 
NATO, to which Macedonia is waiting to be admitted. Also, some 
other benefits could be allotted to it [Macedonia] if it 
fulfills some of the conditions that are not so dramatic for us, 
and that were not acceptable when recognition of this state was 
at stake. However, NATO is present in Macedonia with the 
presence of the U.S. troops, and all European countries can give 
the country their help separately, and not as members of the 
Union (some have already done that), and the Republic is already 
present in the CSCE, regardless of the status it has been given. 
  According to all this, all the drama has but one goal -- to 
return the Macedonian-Greek dispute to the European Union, and 
instead of reviewing the closure of the borders as a legal 
problem (which it really is), it is adding a political dimension 
to it, because the main defense of official Athens is based on 
this trump, contained in the two articles of the Maastricht 
agreement. That is, in the case of a threat to the stability of 
this region, it is possible to close the borders with a 
particular neighboring country, although it says "in 
consultation with other EU countries." The way matters are now, 
it is evident that these efforts are not echoed in Brussels, 
where the closure of the borders is seen as an internal question 
and as a violation of the regulations signed by all the member 
states, starting from those on free trade and the transfer of 
services, up to the fact that the Greek border also represents a 
EU border. 
  All this speaks in favor of the announcement that this week 
will really be conclusive, but for Greece, which could 
definitely be put on the agenda of the European Justice Court. 
What we are particularly interested in is the possible, though 
not yet scheduled, meeting between Foreign Minister Stevo 
Crvenkovski and Cyrus Vance in Geneva, after he has met and 
talked to Greek Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias. It is also 
sure that our position will remain the same, and it means that 
we are constantly ready to talk about all disputed questions -- 
"a basket" that has already been offered a few times so far, in 
which there is no "item" on the change of the name of Macedonia, 
regardless of how much Greece wants it and of what it is capable 
of doing to achieve it.

<F P=106> [Article by Petr Dudek: "The Future: Pressure of Arms </F>
Lobbies"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Light Arms Are in Greatest Demand </H5>
  The Czech Republic cannot boast of having the most perfect 
arms systems, but this does not matter in today's world of war 
conflicts. On the contrary. A British paper, THE ECONOMIST, 
quotes the annual report of the Stockholm International Peace 
Institute (SIPRI), according to which only light weapons were 
used in the approximately 30 wars last year. 
  Sophisticated arms systems (such as those used by the 
Western 
allies in the Persian Gulf war) are in the arsenal of the armies 
to divert inimical neighbors from possible intentions to launch 
an attack. The combat in Bosnia, Azerbaijan, and Angola, as we 
can see on our television screens, is conducted with light arms, 
not the most modern ones. Rifles, machine guns, and 
minesweepers used today may have been used in World War II. 
  Illicit dealers find potential partners in countries of 
Central and East Europe. These countries are traditional arms 
producers, and their newly established market economies do not 
abound with foreign currency. How does the Czech Republic 
control the export of these goods? 
<H5>  Industrial Circles Can Deal With Whomever They Want </H5>
  At present, the government interferes in the negotiation 
process at a stage where the deal is about to be concluded and 
not before. In fact, Czech enterprises can negotiate contracts 
as they want, with the risk that the export license for a 
specific case may be refused. The state administration is 
invited in only when the deal is about to be concluded. The 
affair surrounding the RDP Consortium Group shows where these 
practices may lead. 
  As of 1 April, a new law on foreign trade in military 
material, approved by parliament recently, will come into force. 
According to this law, an enterprise will only be allowed to 
enter the arms market with a license issued by the Ministry of 
Industry, which will be issued after consultations with the 
Foreign Ministry, the Interior Ministry, and the Defense 
Ministry. 
  The RDP Consortium Group is one of the best known entities 
on 
the arms market in the Czech Republic. The weekly RESPEKT no. 
8/94 carried information on the intention of the consortium to 
export, in cooperation with the Skoda factory, military 
technology, including surface-to-surface missiles and spare 
parts for T-72 tanks, to Iran--that is, into a politically and 
militarily very unreliable country. 
  By being reluctant to state their clear opinion on the case, 
official places have shown that the RDP Group intentions are not 
something that should be discussed publicly. Vladimir Dlouhy, 
minister of industry and trade, announced to CTK on 22 February 
that no one had negotiated the deal, and he refused to comment 
on it. All of this activity was initiated by Czech 
industrialists. "The Ministry of Defense will not approve of 
exports to any country that is politically inappropriate," 
Defense Minister Antonin Baudys told LIDOVE NOVINY on 4 February 
on the subject of the possible export of Czech arms to 
fundamentalist Iran. At the same time, he admitted that 
industrial circles may negotiate with whomever they want. 
  Lubomir Soudek, director general of the Skoda factory and a 
member of the RDP Group Presidium, criticized the publicity the 
case had received and indicated that, if the intentions of the 
Skoda factory do not materialize, it could cause higher 
unemployment. Does that mean that the RDP will export the arms 
to Iran? 
  Dr. Bretislav Gregr is the responsible official from the 
Ministry of Industry and Trade who decides on granting the final 
license (in the form of an administrative decision), after 
preliminary discussion with appropriate ministries. "The 
problem of the export of heavy arms to Iran is quite 
hypothetical because the Czech Republic is not a manufacturer of 
these products. I personally believe that, as long as the 
situation in Iran remains unchanged, our country will not step 
out of the line of countries that are carefully considering the 
possible international impact and will not export military 
technology to that region," he told LIDOVE NOVINY on 22 
February, and he added that he did not expect that he would have 
to decide the RDP Group proposition in the near future. 
Nevertheless, should such a situation arise, Dr. Gregr believes 
that it is "difficult to imagine" that he would give his consent. 
<H5>  Wandering Kalashnikovs </H5>
  In Europe, the parties engaged in the Yugoslav conflict feel 
the shortage of arms of all kinds. Irrespective of the embargo, 
arms are flowing into the former Yugoslavia from all directions. 
Estimates for 1993 speak about military material worth some $2 
billion. Arms of various origin are being smuggled into former 
Yugoslavia. They are coming from at least as many countries as 
there are countries forming the United Nations Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR]. "It is useless to even ask from where this or that 
Kalashnikov has come," Canadian Colonel Oehring, commander of 
the South Sector in Croatia, told LIDOVE NOVINY last week. 
  During the real or faked transactions, the most remote 
countries can play the role of the country of destination. The 
Czech Republic could quite easily become a source of arms for 
the battlefields in Bosnia. A strong enough lobby promoting 
arms exports could manage it. Can such a pressure group appear 
in the Czech Republic? "The trade in arms is linked to 
important financial profits, and this is why it is possible to 
imagine a situation where the most important arms companies 
could acquire an increased influence on the state administration 
(as the signals from the RDP Group have indicated). However, the 
newly adopted law will be able to sufficiently resist the 
pressure from possible lobbies," Dr. Gregr says.

<F P=106> [Regular Tuesday interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav </F>
Klaus by correspondent Lucie Weissova in Great Britain; date not 
given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Weissova] Our interview is taking place in 
Great Britain. You are halfway through your visit and many 
meetings are still ahead of you. However, I would like to ask 
you to tell us something about the significance of your visit 
and to assess the talks you have held so far, above all your 
talks with Prime Minister John Major. 
  [Klaus] [passage omitted] So far we have not had many 
official contacts at the highest state level with Great Britain. 
[passage omitted] Thus our visit is filling this vacuum. It is 
necessary to leave a mark here. [passage omitted] 
  Simply, it is necessary to represent the Czech Republic 
here. 
I think that this is a never-ending process that is important 
because it is continuing and never-ending, rather than because 
of one specific result of one specific action. This is the 
purpose of such visits. 
  Our talks with John Major concentrated, of course, more on 
international political phenomena than on bilateral relations. 
There is no significant political, economic, or any other 
problem in relations between the Czech Republic and Great 
Britain that we should put an end to, resolve, or put right. I 
think the fundamental things, fundamental necessary agreements, 
are in existence. We have formed the legislative basis for our 
relations. Thus, the Cabinets have done what they should have 
done and might have done, and now it is the turn of micro 
subjects--i.e., citizens, entrepreneurs--to make use of the 
created space. 
  We spoke about external issues, about foreign policy. As far 
as John Major is concerned, the subject of Bosnia dominated [our 
talks], without doubt. This is so because Great Britain, as we 
are well aware, was a bit less vocal when those strong 
ultimatums were being issued by NATO, laying stress on the land 
forces rather than an air attack. However, it has seized the 
initiative now and is strongly emphasizing the land forces, 
strengthening its contingent there, seeking support for this 
kind of activity. It was not by chance that John Major opened 
our talks by speaking about this. 
  [Weissova] Prime Minister, Hungary announced last week that 
it would submit an application to join the European Union by the 
end of April. You reacted by saying that the Czech Republic 
would do the same when it was ready. When do you think we are 
going to be ready? I am not asking about the time but about the 
conditions that we will have to fulfill. 
  [Klaus] We all know that the question of our entry to the 
European Union or NATO is not about how quickly we file our 
application. We hope no one is deluding himself into thinking 
along these lines. [passage omitted] 
  [Weissova] Do you think we might wait for such a long time, 
for 20 or 30 years? 
  [Klaus] Certainly not. Norway's experience was specific. 
[passage omitted] This is not our case. Time runs faster now. 
[passage omitted] I would say we have already succeeded in one 
go to overcome all world records. In 1990, when I was finance 
minister, I organized the readmittance into the International 
Monetary Fund. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by "cer": "A Good Sign for Czech-Slovene </F>
Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Prague--Herman Rigelnik, chairman of the State 
Chamber of the Republic of Slovenia, described the two-day visit 
to the Czech Republic he started yesterday as a continuation in 
the development of the very good relations between the two 
states. 
  Following its arrival in Prague, the Slovene delegation 
talked with the Chamber of Deputies chairman and Deputy Chairman 
Karel Ledvinka, who also took part in the working lunch at the 
seat of the Chamber. Milan Uhde and Herman Rigelnik expressed 
their shared interest in the drafting and adopting of a 
framework Czech-Slovene Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation. 
Further, Milan Uhde assured the guest of the Czech support for 
the Slovene endeavors to join the European structures. 
  The chamber chairman declared that the smooth running of the 
talks regarding the Czech-Slovene agreement on a free-trade zone 
is a good sign for cooperation between the two countries. After 
the joint working lunch, Chamber Deputy Chairman Karel Ledvinka 
told a CESKY DENIK correspondent the following: 
  "The chairman of the Slovene parliament is an economist like 
myself, so we had something to discuss. The reception by 
Chairman Uhde was conducted in the spirit of cooperation between 
the parliaments and cooperation in the sphere of culture. 
  "At the lunch, we dealt with the economic development 
indicators for both countries, assessed the progress of 
privatization, and mutually clarified the budget problems. We 
agreed that, after the meeting with the president, which will be 
dedicated to the questions of foreign policy, and the talks 
between the delegation and the finance minister, we will again 
meet for lunch. Chairman Rigelnik invited us to visit Slovenia, 
and an impulse also came from the Slovene side for closer 
cooperation between our Foreign Committees. The treaty between 
the two countries that the Foreign Ministry is preparing 
according to a new model will play a significant role in the 
awareness of Slovenia in the Czech Republic.''

<F P=106> [Interview with Milos Zeman, chairman of the Czech Social </F>
Democratic Party, by Jiri Leschtina; place and date not given: 
"Meeting the Government Halfway Would Be Political Suicide"] 
  [Text] Milos Zeman, a year after he was elected chairman 
of the Social Democrats, is still embarrassing not only his 
opponents within his own party, but also those who helped him to 
come to power some time ago. Some of his people are asking if 
his strong antigovernment course of action makes any sense at 
all, and they are disquieted by the declining election 
preferences for the party. Milos Zeman, who threatened that his 
arrival as head of the Czech Social Democratic Party [CSSD] 
would become a tragedy for the rightist parties, does not allow, 
in an interview for MLADA FRONTA DNES, any questioning of his 
work as head of the CSSD: 
  [Zeman] Politics is a long-distance race. It is measured 
not in months but in years. We will become a dangerous 
opposition to today's conservative government, as dangerous as 
the Labor Party is to the Conservatives in Great Britain or the 
Social Democrats to the Christian Democrats in Germany. 
  [Leschtina] After you were elected you said that your party 
would flood parliament with legislative bills. Where are they? 
  [Zeman] We presented a bill to abolish the senate and one on 
conflict of interests. In a short time, we will be presenting 
two bills--one on territorial division and one on the obligation 
to prove one's source of income and property. 
  [Leschtina] This is not a formidable flood of bills. 
Moreover, according to information available to us, the bill on 
the conflict of interest has not been presented to parliament 
yet. 
  [Zeman] Your information is not correct. We have already 
presented the bill to committee, and we are now holding talks 
with the Civic Democratic Alliance on whether we can come up 
with a joint draft. Otherwise, I admit that our original idea 
to establish a team of well-paid experts whom we need to draft 
individual sections of the law has been abandoned because our 
coffers are empty and we have debts. Owing to our lack of 
funds, our original intentions have been curbed but not changed. 
  [Leschtina] You have promised to disclose a number of 
privatization affairs, including the "violation of the law by 
the Civic Democratic Party." Can you give an example to our 
readers of a case in which you have caught the Civic Democratic 
Party violating the law? 
  [Zeman] We have presented dozens of these. For example, the 
Aero Holding affair, which was presented by Deputy Kraus, the 
Plzenske Pivovary [Plzen Breweries] affair presented by Vaclav 
Grulich, the affair surrounding the buildings of the Research 
Institute of Agricultural Technology belonging to a religious 
order.... I could continue.... 
  [Leschtina] They are cases that have been discussed in the 
press. Have you yourselves come up with evidence that the Civic 
Democratic Party has violated the law? 
  [Zeman] The opposition can only suggest that the cases that 
had been revealed be sorted out. We have suggested several 
times, always in vain, that a parliamentary commission be 
established. We have submitted a report to the Control Office. 
Our party is not a detective agency able to discover all of the 
violations of the law in all the minute details. 
  [Leschtina] As long as you say that the law has been 
violated, you can initiate criminal proceedings at the Office 
for Investigation. Why did you not do so after you had said 
that Communist Party of Czechoslovakia property was used, to a 
certain extent, to finance the election campaign of the parties 
with a strong anticommunist program? 
  [Zeman] You are asking me to assume the role not only of a 
detective office but also that of the prosecutor general, which 
has been abolished, by the way. A political party may express 
suspicion that the law has been broken and present supporting 
arguments. 
  [Leschtina] What arguments can you bring to support the 
suspicion that one of the rightist parties financed its election 
campaign using some communist property? 
  [Zeman] We are willing, of course, to present evidence, if 
parliament deals with the problem. Specifically, this case 
happened in North Bohemia. 
  [Leschtina] You are not going to tell us more? 
  [Zeman] Our sources are from former inspection authorities. 
You will certainly understand that I do not want to say anything 
specific because we would be unable to acquire more information. 
  [Leschtina] Very often, in connection with the Civic 
Democratic Party, you say that we have, once again, one-party 
rule. The Civic Democratic Party, however, is working in 
coalition with three parties and is unable to push for anything 
without their support in parliament. 
  [Zeman] I do not want to dramatize the situation, but I do 
realize that there is a significant difference between the 
situation after and before November 1989. Nevertheless, if I 
have to use your arguments, I must say that even the Communist 
Party of Czechoslovakia did not have an absolute monopoly. 
Other government parties shared power, at least formally. 
  [Leschtina] Are you then comparing the Civic Democratic 
Party and other coalition parties to the powerless members of 
the National Front? 
  [Zeman] I am not saying that the two things are identical, 
but I am saying that pushing for only one acceptable alternative 
means limiting the democratic space. 
  [Leschtina] In the annual report you presented to the 
Central Executive Committee of the CSSD in January, you said, 
among other things: "Zhirinovskiy's relative success may 
finally have opened the eyes of those who have been idealizing 
our right-wing parties and refuse to see their inclination 
toward authoritarian, and, in extreme case, fascist, forms of 
government." Do you believe that our right-wing parties have 
fascist tendencies? 
  [Zeman] I was building on Mr. Kotas's statement some time 
ago that the more right-wing that people were, the better. With 
my sentence I am reacting to the idea that the more right-wing I 
am, the more democratic and open I am. Josef Kudlacek, the 
publisher of CESKY DENIK, is of the opinion that we should 
become even more right-wing. I was trying to use the proof by 
contradiction. If you amplify a certain trend, which has 
authoritarian forms in our country, you can demonstrate its 
extremes. The fascist form is such an extreme. Mr. Kudlacek or 
the Republicans are certainly extreme right-wingers. 
  [Leschtina] These gentlemen are not in government. Does 
that mean that you do not believe that the government parties 
have fascist traits? 
  [Zeman] Our coalition is being accused of having 
authoritarian inclinations. However, I cannot exclude the 
possibility that, if some representatives from the ruling 
parties--I mean mainly their fundamental wings--found themselves 
facing a difficult situation, they would show fascist traits. 
On the other hand, I firmly believe that those who describe 
themselves as pragmatists will win within these parties. 
  [Leschtina] How do you explain that the continued growth in 
your party's popularity has halted and declined, according to 
recent polls? 
  [Zeman] As I said, without money, successful politics cannot 
be conducted for a long time. Almost everything is done on the 
basis of voluntary work in our party, and this is why we often 
react with a certain delay, and--I have to add 
self-critically--we often lack expertise. By cooperating with a 
team of qualified experts, we can become a more efficient and 
aggressive opposition. I do not need to remind you that the 
popularity of our party is better than Mr. Lux's party, which 
has 85,000 members and whose chairman we can see constantly on 
television. 
  [Leschtina] On the other hand, the Civic Democratic Party 
still has the support of two-thirds of the population. What is 
the reason for that, in your opinion? 
  [Zeman] People have the feeling, thanks to coupon 
privatization, that they have become rich owners, and they are 
expecting fat dividends, which makes them satisfied with the 
government. However, the enterprises that thousands of small 
owners are unable to control are facing a gradual downturn. 
When the people sober up from their illusions, from the dream 
that every little old lady in the Orlicke mountains has become a 
minicapitalist, as Tomas Jezek [National Property Fund chairman] 
put it, they will turn away from the Civic Democratic Party. 
  [Leschtina] Are you sticking to your statement that our 
coupon privatization is the fraud of the century? 
  [Zeman] I am convinced that it will soon become clear that 
the feedback that has been severed between the owner and 
management will lead to a decline in output in a large number of 
our enterprises. From this viewpoint, the statement about the 
fraud of the century holds. 
  [Leschtina] Are you not underestimating the intelligence of 
our population when you say that 80 percent of the nation has 
swallowed the bait? 
  [Zeman] The Bolshevik concept of nationwide ownership is not 
very remote from the idea of coupon privatization, and the 
majority of our population swallowed it in the past. We cannot 
argue by saying that, if the majority agrees with an idea, this 
is sufficient proof of its correctness. We would then have to 
accept the absurd fact that Hitlerism was correct because almost 
80 percent of the population agreed with it. 
  [Leschtina] Those are dangerous comparisons. 
  [Zeman] You cannot infer from this that I am comparing the 
existing regime to Hitlerism--God forbid! I am only describing, 
using a drastic example, that majority approval may be 
meaningless. 
  [Leschtina] Are you suggesting that your party's strategy 
should be based on the fact that people are somewhat retarded, 
but they will realize it, and one day they will understand the 
avant-garde management of the CSSD? 
  [Zeman] I have never said anything like that. We are not 
visionaries, we are not turning away from today's problems, and 
our reactions--to the security situation, for example--testify 
to this fact. Apart from that, we are trying to react to 
problems that do not seem topical to a number of people, but 
soon will be. A classical example of these problems is 
unemployment, a problem that is dismissed by the majority but 
that will become a topical problem tomorrow. We are preparing 
specific programs to deal with unemployment now. 
  [Leschtina] Recently, your adviser Oto Novotny came up with 
a document saying that the Social Democrats cannot become 
successful in the long run through a confrontational strategy 
and by criticizing the government without giving it credit for 
its successes. How does the man who has become a celebrity 
because of his statement "we must go for the government's 
throat" react to this document? 
  [Zeman] The case of Mr. Hirs and many others shows that a 
policy that would meet the government halfway is political 
suicide for the opposition parties. Every day the opposition 
must vehemently criticize errors by the government, its 
conservatism and its monetarism. Monetarism ceased to be a 
topical issue in economic science a long time ago. This is what 
other social democratic parties in Europe are doing, in any case. 
  [Leschtina] Their criticism is specific and does not go 
beyond the borders of elementary political culture, which cannot 
be said of some of your statements. 
  [Zeman] Look, U.S. President George Bush once said that his 
dog Millie understood foreign policy better than Bill Clinton. 
I do not see any reason to use less juicy statements than a 
politician who, unlike us, lived in the milieu of the 
traditional Western culture for 40 years. 
  [Leschtina] Some CSSD members are afraid that Zeman's 
antigovernment bigotry will become an increasingly large burden 
on his party on a political scene that is stabilizing. Will 
your election for leader of the CSSD become a tragedy for the 
CSSD? 
  [Zeman] First, I do not believe that our political scene is 
stabilizing. The constant deterioration of the economic 
situation will lead to political unrest. As regards my future: 
Sartre wrote that the truth about yourself becomes the genuine 
truth only after it is understood by others. I would like to 
add that the truth becomes the genuine truth for a politician 
only when it is understood by the electorate.

<F P=106> [Interview with I. Prikryl, chairman of the Union of Czech </F>
and Moravian Housing Cooperatives, by Vladimir Cechlovsky; place 
and date not given: "Including Transformation Norms in the 
Housing Law Is Neither Legally Clean nor Decent"] 
  [Text] [Cechlovsky] Recently, when commenting on the 
proposals by the [government] coalition deputies that other 
cooperative property be included in the transfer of cooperative 
housing units [to private ownership], you said that it would 
lead to the liquidation of many cooperatives. These deputies, 
however--O. Fejfar (Civic Democratic Party), for 
instance--categorically refused this view. Do you insist on it? 
  [Prikryl] Yes, I do. Following the adoption of the new 
statutes, which the Transformation Law of 1992 compelled the 
cooperatives to accept, most of the cooperatives' property was 
included in an indivisible fund. If it is now enshrined in the 
law that the member of a cooperative also has the right, when 
taking over the housing unit, to have that part of the property 
that is registered in the indivisible fund paid out, it really 
can lead to the liquidation of the cooperative. As a matter of 
fact, such a liquidation can also be initiated by the court. To 
pretend that nothing is at stake and, at the same time, beyond 
the framework of the proposal of their own coalition government, 
try to include fundamental transformation norms in the housing 
law is neither legally clean nor decent. 
  [Cechlovsky] So, you are against a further transformation of 
housing cooperatives? 
  [Prikryl] The transformation of housing cooperatives took 
place in the past, and precisely according to instructions. 
Another question altogether is whether the instructions called 
for a lot or a little. Nonetheless, the actual responsibility 
for the results is borne by the deputies of the then Federal 
Assembly. They are basically the same ones as those who are 
dissatisfied today and submit additional proposals. If, today, 
the coalition deputies do not like the result of the 
transformation of cooperatives, they certainly are free to 
request another transformation. We consider it appropriate, 
however, that such an intervention has the form of an amendment 
to the transformation law, the Commercial Code, and the law on 
banks. 
  [Cechlovsky] Why? 
  [Prikryl] It is a guarantee that the eventual change is 
implemented responsibly. After all, no parliament--and that 
includes this one--it is not a simple matter to alter the 
Commercial or Civic Codes, which belong to the pillars of the 
legal system in any advanced country. 
  [Cechlovsky] That is the legal side of the issue. The 
deputies are reasoning for urgency, however, by, among other 
things, numerous letters from the cooperative members, and, by 
extension, that a further transformation is in the interest of 
all members of the cooperatives. 
  [Prikryl] As long as it was not self-help construction by 
the members or nonresidential premises in cooperative buildings, 
like various shops, stores, offices, etc., in 90 percent of 
cases they were financed solely by the state and not by the 
members of the cooperatives. In these instances, I do not see 
any reason that several individuals should grab these 
nonresidential premises. They should remain in the ownership of 
the cooperative, and the proceeds should support the cost of 
housing of all members of the cooperative. 
  [Cechlovsky] Without any exception? What if these 
nonresidential premises are a burden for the people living in 
the given house because, for instance, there is noise, etc.? 
  [Prikryl] That is something else. In such an instance, we 
would agree that the nonresidential premises be transferred to 
co-ownership of the people in the building. It is necessary, 
however, to individually assess whether that is the case. In 
case of a conflict, even before a court. 
  [Cechlovsky] What about the other nonresidential premises, 
the cost of which the cooperative members in the given building 
shared? 
  [Prikryl] It is quite clear there. We have no objections 
regarding their transfer to the co-ownership of the people in 
the building. 
  [Cechlovsky] The deputies are proposing and will probably 
approve a compulsory transfer of the housing units from the 
ownership of the cooperative to the ownership of the members. 
How do you feel about that? 
  [Prikryl] Frankly, this stipulation does not worry us in the 
least. If I decided to do something voluntarily earlier, it 
cannot trouble me when the state orders me to do it by law. 
Personally, however, I cannot come to terms with the parliament 
again showing disrespect for the ownership rights. After all, 
it is inexcusable to expropriate a legal person to benefit its 
shareholder. It is a dangerous precedent. 
  [Cechlovsky] The fact is that the transfers of cooperative 
housing units stopped.... 
  [Prikryl] It is not through any fault of ours. The housing 
cooperatives wanted to transfer the units and did a lot for that 
purpose. The transfers were stopped by the Czech Land Register 
and Surveying Bureau that reasoned for this by not having a 
legal basis for making the entry in the real estate register. 
This lapse is to be eliminated by the currently drafted law on 
housing ownership. 
  [Cechlovsky] To own a housing unit is not the end. Someone 
must maintain it and take care of its administration. A 
cooperative member may not feel comfortable in a large 
cooperative. What will you offer to these people? Should they 
not have the opportunity, after all, to secede from the 
cooperative even with a share of the cooperative property. 
  [Prikryl] There is a better solution--namely, that 
individual self-administrative units emerge from the original 
cooperative, which, however, remains functional. The new units 
would then take care of the entrusted housing units, thus 
bringing the ownership closer to the people while being able to 
use the services of the original cooperative. 
  [Cechlovsky] How would this benefit the people? 
  [Prikryl] The principle of cooperatives is a service to the 
people. They will not have to take care of everything, and the 
cost will be relatively reasonable. Take the energy aspect of 
our housing, for instance. There are many houses that should 
have been built in North Africa rather than here because their 
insulation would be more appropriate there, are in desperate 
need of repairs: a thermal treatment of the encasements and 
roofs, and reconstruction of the housing cores. The people in 
an individual building are not always able to take care of this 
all by themselves. Nonetheless, there is also just the ordinary 
caretaking in the building. If the cooperatives were eliminated 
and each member got with his unit, say, 3,000 korunas--it would 
hardly be more--it would not be of much help. For this money, 
nobody would take care of the houses for long. 
  [Cechlovsky] The individual buildings can, however, leave 
the cooperatives right now. They do not need any complex 
legislation for that.... 
  [Prikryl] Yes, that is true, but there still are certain 
barriers. The secession of the self-administration would result 
in the transfer of property, and that means paying taxes. Thus, 
the taxes must be eliminated first. Furthermore, the secession 
of any self-administration must be approved by the plenary 
session of the entire cooperative. The transformation means 
that a decision by the self-administration would suffice for 
leaving the cooperative. No outsider could prevent it. Such a 
solution is virtually identical with that demanded by the 
coalition deputies, but it is a pragmatic one and not a 
politically impulsive one.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Slovakia Supports the U.S. Presence in </F>
Europe"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The Slovak Government approved at its 
most recent session pioneering material drafted by the Defense 
Ministry and submitted by Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak. 
This material contains the Slovak Republic Defense Doctrine, 
which incorporates a set of official principles and views on the 
Slovak Republic's defense, preventing war, the structure of the 
Armed Forces, and the means of conducting an armed struggle in 
defense of the state. Asserting Slovakia's national interests, 
with the aim of guaranteeing its territorial integrity and the 
inviolability or unchangeability of its internationally 
recognized state borders, is among the fundamental principles of 
the Defense Doctrine. 
  In its Defense Doctrine, the Slovak Republic avows that, 
under no circumstances, will it either precipitate an armed 
conflict or initiate one against another state. According to 
the doctrine, the Slovak Republic will not condone the 
propaganda of war and armed force, terrorism, chauvinism, 
fascism, race and class hatred, or national and religious 
intolerance. Slovakia will not give up its right to take part 
in establishing collective security and therefore will strive to 
join NATO and the Western European Union (WEU). 
  Apart from the Defense Doctrine, the Slovak Government also 
approved other important material drafted by the Defense 
Ministry--the Principles for the Slovak Republic's National 
Security. This document was drafted in cooperation with the 
Interior Ministry and the Foreign Ministry. 
  The principles establish a political, legal, and 
methodological basis for the Republic's national defense system. 
At the same time, they represent a systematized series of 
general objectives in issues such as the sovereignty of the 
state, territorial integrity, and Slovakia's equality, and in 
guaranteeing the citizen's basic rights and freedoms. Binding 
international documents, the Slovak Constitution, and 
recommendations and information from analyses of the security 
systems of comparable European states were endorsed in the 
drafting of the Principles for the Slovak Republic's National 
Security. 
  Slovakia's security is an element of the broader framework 
of 
European and global security. The Slovak Republic relies on its 
own forces. However, at the same time, it places emphasis on 
establishing new international relations. In its objectives, it 
is counting, first and foremost, on NATO, the WEU, the CSCE, and 
the United Nations. Slovakia considers stable, conflict-free, 
and correct relations with its immediate neighbors to be an 
important aspect of guaranteeing its national security. It is 
interested in activity within the Visegrad Group and the Central 
European Initiative. 
  The Slovak Republic is aware of the need for equilibrium in 
its relations with all European states. At the moment, it is 
achieving this aim by means of bilateral treaties. It is also 
aware of the positive role filled by the U.S. presence in Europe 
and is in favor of its preservation.

  [Text] The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] has 
been holding talks with the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] 
within the context of its coalition agreement with the Slovak 
National Party [SNS]. HZDS Deputy Chairman Sergej Kozlik said 
this after today's joint session of the HZDS and SNS 
parliamentary groups in Bratislava. At the same time, he said 
that they would not exclude an agreement with the SDL with 
regard to stabilizing the Cabinet for a certain limited period 
or until the elections, regardless of whom the HZDS was in 
coalition. 
  Answering a question regarding whether a cancellation of the 
coalition agreement with the SNS and concluding a new coalition 
with the SDL are being considered, Kozlik said that they had not 
looked at this issue from this point of view. 
  In this context, Miloslav Kona, chairman of the SNS 
parliamentary group, expressed the conviction that the SDL would 
change its stance on refusing a coalition with the SNS while its 
chairman is Jan Slota. 
  Commenting on the alleged offer of the presidential post to 
the SDL by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, Kozlik explained 
that, during a free debate outside the framework of the official 
HZDS-SDL talks, it had been noted that it would not be 
impossible for the HZDS to imagine an SDL candidate for the 
presidential post. However, this was not discussed as an actual 
offer. 
  The parliamentary groups of the coalition parties also 
discussed individual points of the agenda of the session of the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic, which will open on 9 
March.

<F P=106> [From the "Pressclub" program--live] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Good evening, esteemed television 
viewers. As usual on Tuesday, you can watch a live relay of the 
Pressclub roundtable about topical issues discussed by the 
Cabinet. I welcome the Cabinet members who are here to brief us 
on the 86th Session of the Cabinet--Prime Minister Vladimir 
Meciar, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Julius Toth, 
and Deputy Prime Minister Jozef Prokes. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Minister, the Cabinet's original agenda for its session 
about two weeks ago included the issue of [word indistinct] a 
memorandum to the IMF. Could you explain what this document is, 
what the issue is? 
  [Toth] I cannot tell you much detail because the document 
has 
not been discussed. [passage omitted] It is not so much the 
issue of making stricter some criteria we agreed upon in 
December. As you know, the deficit of our state budget has been 
a bit higher than what we agreed on. A certain responsibility 
is felt, a certain fear has emerged that we might fail to keep 
this year's budget within the planned framework, though we have 
explained that our criteria are totally different from those of 
last year. As you all remember, in March 1993 our budget 
deficit had already reached 11 billion korunas; we do not expect 
such a dynamic development this year. Our economy has become, 
to a certain extent, clear, and we know its outlines. We are 
not engaged any more in drafting a new tax system, and I hope we 
will not have to do so in the next 50 years. This means that 
our macroeconomic conditions are different. 
  However, IMF experts, like all good bankers, always have 
worse times in mind. This is why our views on this issue were 
controversial, that two of us held different views. 
  We believe that, provided we keep the budget criteria 
according to our original agreement, we will not have to take 
any further, more serious, measures. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified journalist] Prime Minister, a report by the 
Slovak-Czech border commission was heard by the government 
today. It emerges from this that the only controversial point, 
in fact, is Kasarnie. It would appear that this question should 
be discussed by the Czech and Slovak prime ministers. I talked 
about it today with Minister Tuchyna, who said that there was 
nothing controversial, that everything was but Czech conjecture 
and everything was in fact all right. What would you say about 
the situation that exists on the Czech-Slovak border? 
  [Meciar] It is about setting frontiers. A border line is 
being sought so it may run along natural features--for example, 
waterways: along the center of a waterway, or along mountain 
tops. Since the Morava River has been canalized, the flow of 
the river has been somewhat simplified and Slovakia lost 120 
hectares. We are asking the Czech side to compensate for this 
loss by increasing the territory from the Czech Republic in 
other places that have been discussed and proposed, as 
compensation of territory in the interests of balance. If this 
is not the case, naturally, the river would in some places flow 
only on the territory of the Slovak Republic. 
  Another demand that came from the Czech side was aimed at a 
part of the Sidonia settlement, specifically 11 houses in the 
village of Horne Srnie in the district of Trencin, belonging to 
the Czech Republic. We had a petition of citizen inhabitants, 
the majority of whom asked to be citizens of the Czech Republic 
and for the territory to belong to the Czech Republic. There 
has been a proposal of compensation for this territory by 
another part of Sidonia, which has not been accepted by the 
government. 
  So, the situation is a little more complicated here in that 
Sidonia should also have been the subject of compensation, but 
it will not be. 
  The third aspect concerns Kasarnie, where the original talks 
had led to a proposal being made to the government for the prime 
ministers to talk about the settlement of Makov, a part of 
Kasarnie, where there is a shortage of 60-500 hectares. The 
government has accepted the viewpoint that there was nothing to 
discuss. It is the territory of the Slovak Republic, the state 
border is clear, the Czech tourists who do not want to go there 
[changes thought], it is their property, but it does not belong 
to the Czech Republic just because they have holiday houses and 
territory there. We will not talk about it. 
  So, this in fact simplified compensation down to only 120 
hectares of territory as a result of the canalization of the 
Morava River. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] [Announcer Lydia Mrazova] The Slovak Cabinet, 
led by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, is holding a regular 
meeting in Bratislava today. The Cabinet is due to discuss more 
than 30 issues. According to the Slovak Republic News Agency 
[TASR], the prime minister said the government would discuss 
personnel issues today, and it would assess also the nominees to 
the post of minister of foreign affairs and minister for the 
administration and privatization of national property. Michal 
Tvarozek reports from the Government's Office about the meeting 
so far. 
  [Tvarozek] The aforementioned issues have not gotten onto 
the 
agenda so far. Jozef Tuchyna, minister of the interior, and 
Ondrej Hanko, director of the [Government] Press and Information 
Department, took part in a short news briefing, which ended 
about 25 minutes ago. 
  Mr. Hanko provided a brief summary of the meeting so far. He 
said that the prime minister first briefed the Cabinet members 
on his talks with the Party of the Democratic Left on 7 March, 
adding that the results were confidential. Hanko went on to say 
that the government had adopted a resolution entrusting Deputy 
Prime Ministers Sergej Kozlik and Julius Toth to draft proposals 
on the use of the Japanese loan for small and medium-sized 
enteprise. [passage omitted] 
  [Tvarozek] Minister Jozef Tuchyna said afterwards: 
  [Begin recording] [Tuchyna] The last item we discussed was 
the report on the work of the joint [Czech-Slovak] border 
delimitation commission submitted on behalf of the Slovak side 
by the commission's chairman, Mr. (Becka). This report was not 
adopted in its entirety. Regarding the incorporation of the 
settlement of Sidonia in the area of the village of Horne Srnie 
and compensation for this, the government decided not to 
incorporate it into the Czech Republic. [passage omitted] 
  [Hanko] Representative of PRACE, if you please. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I would like to know what the 
border delimination commission will do next and whether this 
issue will be returned to the government again. 
  [Tuchyna] The border delimitation commission has worked in a 
particular way, but now it is a matter for talks between the 
governments. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I would like to ask about the 
reasons that led the government to decide not to add Sidonia to 
the Czech Republic or to a village in the Czech Republic. 
  [Tuchyna] It was simple. The vote taken by the government 
rejected this proposal. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Jozef Tuchyna by Robert </F>
Kotian; place and date not given: "The Crime Rate Is a Common 
Phenomenon Today"] 
  [Excerpts] According to public opinion polls, Slovaks 
consider the crime rate to be one of the greatest problems in 
Slovakia right now. We spoke about some reasons and certain 
interesting cases with Interior Minister Jozef Tuchyna. 
  [Kotian] What are the main reasons for the growing crime 
rate, in your opinion? Is the weakness of the new state a 
reason for that? 
  [Tuchyna] We need to look at several sides to this problem. 
The high crime rate is not only a Slovak problem; it is a common 
phenomenon today in advanced, postcommunist, or totalitarian 
countries. We are distinguishing four main reasons for the 
growth of the crime rate--socioeconomic, legislative, 
international, and personal. After we introduced the market 
economy, many people became uneasy because they lost social 
guarantees and did not know how to tackle the new situation. On 
the other hand, other people are abusing this situation. Many 
legal standards at present overlap--the new ones and the 
socialist ones. Many are imperfect because they have been 
drafted in haste. The people should know the law, but they 
often do not know it at all. We are building a law-abiding 
society, but we have a disparity here between people's awareness 
[of the law] and their actions. From the international 
viewpoint, I would like to stress that Slovakia is facing a new 
situation, where migration is going hand in hand with the 
internationalization of crime. This is a very serious problem 
and should be solved at all levels, not only at the level of the 
Interior Ministry and the police. We have to search for a 
solution and not only in the socioeconomic sphere and the 
material security of the people. We also have to complete our 
legal system and establish the legal awareness of the people, 
which is a long-term affair. The Interior Ministry is much 
engaged in international cooperation. The perfection of the 
school system, family activity, churches, and social 
organizations have positive influence on the development of 
personality. Unfortunately, we did not manage to introduce into 
our schools lessons on crime, drugs, and their impact on human 
personality. [passage omitted] 
  [Kotian] What is the situation with the readmission 
treaties? Do you know how many refugees have been returned from 
the Czech Republic? 
  [Tuchyna] This era is one of movement of nations. Last 
year, some 40 million people went through Slovak territory. 
More than 10 million transportation vehicles were checked in. 
A total of 1,041 people were apprehended when on their way in, 
and 1,140 on their way out. A total of 2,422 people were 
apprehended because of falsifying or tampering with travel 
documents. A total of 82,600 people were returned because of 
flaws in travel documents. This is why the international norms 
and readmission treaties are important to us. We have concluded 
such treaties with practically every country except Hungary. We 
want to conclude a standard international treaty with them, as 
with all other countries. We cannot conclude a treaty on the 
readmission of only Hungarian citizens, which is what they would 
like. [passage omitted]

The official said there were several injured aboard the 
aircraft, which had landed on the island of Krk off the northern 
Croatian coast.

  [Text] A Spanish plane of the Aviocar type, which was on a 
mission controlling the airspace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, has been 
hit by antiaircraft fire. Three of its nine passengers, one 
British, one French, and one American, were slightly wounded by 
shrapnel. 
  The planes' crew of three pilots and a Spanish mechanic were 
not hurt, although it had to make an emergency landing at the 
Rijeka airport in Croatia. 
  The plane was transporting personnel between Split and 
Zagreb, in Croatian territory. It was flying over Krajina where 
there is often fighting between Serbs and Croats. So far, the 
origin of the antiaircraft fire has not been determined.

  [Text] The political department of the Croatian Ministry of 
Defense has issued the following statement: 
  Shortly after 1200 today a Spanish UN Protection Force plane 
took off from Zagreb for Split. When it was above the Plasko 
area, which is under the control of Serb terrorists, two 
missiles were fired at it. One missed the target and the other 
exploded near the plane and damaged its tail. 
  It can be reliably said that the missiles were fired by Serb 
terrorists, members of the so-called 39th Banija Corps. 
  There were four crew members and five passengers on the 
plane. Three of them were slightly wounded. The missiles were 
fired at 1235. 
  The plane made an emergency landing at Krk airport at 1252, 
the statement says.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 9 (AFP) -- Separatist Serbs in 
Croatia's Krajina province denied Wednesday [9 March] having 
shot at a Spanish Air Force plane used by NATO which was forced 
to make an emergency landing on Tuesday [8 March]. 
  A military headquarters statement carried by the ISKRA news 
agency said the Serb forces had not been informed-of the flight 
and had not even picked it up on their tracking equipment. 
"Consequently, our units could not have opened fire on the 
plane," it said. 
  In Zagreb, the Croatian Defence Ministry said the plane, a 
C-212 Aviocar transport, was hit by anti-aircraft fire, but did 
not explicitly say the Krajina Serbs were responsible. 
  Three of the five people aboard were slightly wounded. The 
plane, heading from Zagreb to Split on the Adriatic, made an 
emergency landing on Krk island near Rijeka port. 
  The NATO supreme command in Brussels said Tuesday the three 
wounded were from France, Britain and the United States.

  [Text] Brussels, March 8 (AFP) -- A NATO transport plane 
was hit by anti-aircraft fire Tuesday while flying over Croatia 
and forced to make an emergency landing, NATO said. 
  Three of the five passengers on the Spanish air force plane 
were injured. The three-member crew escaped injury, NATO said. 
  NATO officials here and the Spanish defense ministry in 
Madrid said they did not know where the gunfire came from. NATO 
officials in Naples said it was hit by ground-based 
anti-aircraft fire. 
  In Zagreb, the Croatian defense ministry said the plane was 
attacked by separatist Serbs who control the Krajina region of 
the former Yugoslav republic. The plane was damaged by the 
mid-air explosion of one of two missiles fired from the ground, 
the ministry said in a statement. 
  NATO said the plane was hit in the right motor and the tail 
while transporting passengers from the capital Zagreb to the 
port city of Split in the south. 
  The NATO supreme command in Brussels said the three wounded 
were from France, Britain and the United States. 
  The plane made an emergency landing on the island of Krk, 
which serves the Croatian coastal city of Rijeka, NATO officials 
said. 
  A Croatian government official in Zagreb, asking not to be 
named, suggested that the plane may have been fired on after it 
strayed off course. "The plane probably mistook its air corridor 
and deviated from its route," he said. 
  The twin-engined CASA 212 aircraft is designed to transport 
either 16 or 19 passengers, depending on the model. It can also 
be used for transporting wounded, aerial photography and 
training missions.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Andjelko Perincic] </F>
  [Text] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister, and Charles Redman, U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's special envoy, held talks in Zagreb this afternoon. 
The talks focused on the implementation of the principles 
governing the constitutional set-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina and a 
possible confederation with Croatia. 
  After the talks the U.S. official declared: To my mind we 
made an enormous amount of progress compared to what had been 
achieved in Washington. Many things still remain to be done. 
This awaits both the U.S. Administration and the Croatian 
Government but I must point out that we are not alone in 
fulfilling this task -- we have the backing of the European 
Union or, more precisely, most of that region, and the other 
peoples in Bosnia. In view of all this we can optimistically 
believe that we are on the right track. However, we are facing 
hard work if we are to work to the benefit of Croatia and 
Bosnia, to the benefit of Europe and the United States. As for 
my talks in Belgrade, this was only a preliminary meeting 
because right now we are focusing on the issue of the Bosnian 
Croats and the Bosnian government. Nevertheless we are studying 
possibilities that would be acceptable to all three sides in 
Bosnia and to the entire region. It is certain that we will 
first have to resolve the existing territorial differences by 
political means, Redman concluded. 
  Croatian Minister Mate Granic also made a brief assessment: 
  [Begin Granic recording] The Vienna negotiations are 
proceeding well and I believe that we will round off the next 
stage on time. Likewise, we can see the first tangible results 
in the field. We are closely collaborating with the European 
Union and, as you know, I will be leaving for Moscow tomorrow, 
where I will have the opportunity to exchange views with my 
colleague, Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
[end recording] 
  [Perincic] Charles Redman will be received by the President 
of the Republic of Croatia, Franjo Tudjman, this evening.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 8 (TANJUG) -- Croatia will intensify 
its activities and initiate "a diplomatic offensive" in an 
effort to re-integrate the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) 
into Croatia, TANJUG learned on Tuesday from well-informed 
Croatian sources. 
  The R.S.K. is now one of the U.N. Protected Areas (UNPA) in 
Croatia. 
  Croatia will focus its activities on negotiations with the 
R.S.K. local and military authorities about the return of Croats 
who have fled these lands. The negotiations will be brokered by 
the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR). 
  The same sources maintain that Serb representatives will be 
offered a possibility of re-integrating the R.S.K. territories 
into Croatian districts, as well as cultural and administrative 
autonomy in the lands where they constituted a majority 
population according to the 1991 census, and the right to take 
part in district assemblies. 
  The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 in predominantly 
Serb-populated parts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia 
in response to Croatia's forcible secession from former 
Yugoslavia and its attempt to reduce the Serbs' status as a 
constituent nation to that of a national minority. 
  The R.S.K. has been the UNPA since 1992, but Croatia has 
launched three large offensives against Krajina's territories 
since then, while uninterrupted Croatian Army attacks on Serb 
positions along the demarcation lines ceased after a ceasefire 
had been signed last December. 
  However, all efforts to reach a lasting agreement on a 
cessation of hostilities have been unsuccessful so far. 
  The sources estimate that the main purpose of Monday's visit 
of Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic to the Senj-Lika 
District, bordering on the R.S.K. in western Croatia, was a 
preparation of a new "diplomatic offensive" against the R.S.K. 
  Jure Radic, head of the presidential office and 
secretary-general of Croatia's ruling party the Croatian 
Democratic Union, confirmed on Saturday in Osijek that Croatia 
intended to initiate "a diplomatic offensive" backed by "a 
variety of political skills." The Osijek District borders on the 
R.S.K in eastern Croatia. 
  The sources estimate that Croatia's officials will primarily 
undertake these activities to "collect evidence" that it is 
necessary for the United Nations to prolong its mandate in the 
R.S.K., i.e. to convince the international community that the 
re-integration of the R.S.K. into Croatia is impossible unless 
pressure is put on Krajina. 
  The current UNPROFOR mandate in the R.S.K. is due to expire 
on March 31, and it is to be renewed by the U.N. Security 
Council if approved by the countries that signed the Cyrus Vance 
plan on the introduction of U.N. Protected Areas to Krajina. 
  At the same time, the R.S.K. Foreign Ministry said it had 
rejected the proposal by UNPROFOR Commander in the UNPA "South" 
Sector, George Oehring, to negotiate with representatives of the 
Serb National Party whose leader is Milan Djukic. 
  The Serb National Party is one of the opposition parties in 
Croatia which has been instructed by the Croatian regime to 
gather all Serbs who have chosen to remain in Croatia. The 
party has proclaimed itself to be a protector of their minority 
rights. 
  A statement released by the R.S.K. Foreign Ministry says the 
R.S.K. considered this proposal by the Serb National Party as 
"one which lacks seriousness," while the document "peace with no 
alternatives" by this party, proposed late last year as a 
negotiating basis, was described as "a set of forgeries." 
  According to the R.S.K. Foreign Ministry, the document 
"contains untenable information that, instead of 400,000 Serbs, 
only 180,000 Serbs have been expelled from Croatia, and that, 
instead of 500,000 Serbs, only 180,000 are living there at this 
time." 
  The document advocates a kind of "confederal" autonomy of 
the 
R.S.K., but it does not envisage for Krajina to have the right 
to secede from Croatia. 
  The R.S.K. authorities underscore that Serbs, who are 
entitled to self-determination like any other former 
Yugoslavia's nation, have voted in a referendum to live in an 
independent state, and therefore any further negotiations on the 
issue are totally out of the question.

<F P=106> [Report by Jelena Hinic] </F>
  [Text] After an hour of talks with Serbian President 
Milosevic, which were held behind closed doors, Charles Redman 
[U.S. President's special envoy] made a statement for 
journalists. Jelena Hinic reports: 
  [Hinic] Redman said that the peace negotiations are going 
though a very important stage and that all the protagonists are 
trying to find comprehensive solutions for Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
which, as he said, will bring more stability to the entire 
region. He said that the United States' efforts concerning an 
agreement between the Bosnian Croats and Muslims have yielded 
fruit. He also positively assessed reports that the military 
forces in central Bosnia are withdrawing from the front lines. 
  Redman said that the agreement between the Bosnian Croats 
and 
Muslims is not enough and that a comprehensive solution for 
Bosnia also requires the participation of the Bosnian Serbs. 
  In reply to the question of whether President Milosevic 
supported this plan during today's talks, Redman said: 
  [Begin Redman recording, in English with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] The negotiations today were of 
course still preliminary, but I wanted to be sure that President 
Milosevic understands what we are trying to do with the Bosnian 
Muslims and Croats. Our intention is to work, I hope rapidly, 
in the direction of an overall solution on Bosnia. We believe 
that all the regional protagonists play an important role in the 
work on this agreement. We expect President Milosevic and other 
leaders in the region to take a very active part in this, as we 
are now trying to move to the second phase in the 
solution-searching process. [end recording] 
  [Hinic] Answering a journalist's question on whether there 
was any mention in the talks of a possible confederation of the 
former Yugoslav republics, Redman said that such plans did not 
exist at this moment. He said that the central issue for the 
Bosnian Serbs at present is whether they accept the offer to 
join the Muslim-Croat confederation. However, regardless of 
this answer, important decisions must be made on territories, 
because it was the question of territories that have been 
blocking all solutions to Bosnia so far, Redman said. 
  We should now determine how the different sides in Bosnia 
will build relations among themselves. This is something that 
they must agree on themselves, U.S. envoy Charles Redman 
stressed in conclusion.

  [Text] Belgrade, 8 March (TANJUG) -- Slobodan Milosevic, 
the president of the Srpska republic, today received Charles 
Redman, President Clinton's special envoy for the Balkans. The 
talks related to the developments in the peace process. 
  President Milosevic said the Croat-Muslim agreement was 
their 
internal affair and there was no reason for anyone to dispute it 
as long as it did not impinge on the interests of the Serb side 
-- and all the more so if its was aimed at achieving peace. 
  At the same time it is understood that no political 
obligations on the Serb side could be inferred from the 
agreement, since the Serb side was not taking part in its 
preparation. Since the final agreement has not yet been 
reached, but has only been announced, it is impossible to take a 
final position on it. 
  President Milosevic stressed he expected the United States 
to 
make efforts towards the suspension of economic sanctions 
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, since the Serb side 
had accepted the European Union's peace plan, to which the 
United States and Russia had also given support. Such an action 
by the United States would be in the spirit of impartiality and 
equal treatment of all three sides in the conflict, which is of 
crucial importance for the lasting resolution of the Yugoslav 
crisis. 
  The Srpska republic will continue to make a contribution 
towards peace in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and to support 
efforts aimed at achieving it, in keeping with its principle 
that nations should be able to exercise their unalienable rights 
and protect their national interests on an equal basis.

  [Text] Banja Luka, March 8 (TANJUG) -- President of 
Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) Zoran Lilic said he hoped peace 
would soon be restored in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "If the war continues, the danger of its spilling is very 
real, and this means a war in the Balkans and Europe, not to go 
anywhere further," Lilic said in an interview published by the 
Banja Luka paper GLAS SRPSKI on Tuesday. 
  He said last week's U.S.-brokered agreement on a 
Moslem-Croat 
federation in Bosnia simply could not work, adding it was wrong 
to exclude the Serbs from the talks. 
  Unless it is aimed against the Serb side, it should not 
bother anyone in the Bosnian Serb republic or Yugoslavia, the 
Yugoslav president said. 
  Bosnian Croats and Moslems started the 23-month-old war as 
allies against local Serbs, but have later turned against each 
other in an attempt to win more territory. Acting under the 
U.S. pressure, they met in Washington last week to sign a 
preliminary deal on forming a federation in Bosnia, which would 
subsequently form a confederation with neighbouring Croatia. 
  Political analysts say Washington has opted for this 
initiative in an attempt to isolate the Serbs before 
pressurizing them at the conference table to make more 
territorial concessions. 
  Arguing that the war had been imposed on Bosnian Serbs, 
Lilic 
said: "Were it for the Serbs, the war would never have started 
... anyway, they have not been fighting for months." [as 
received] 
  "Bosnian Serbs had no other choice but to defend their homes 
and their very existence, and Yugoslavs had no other choice but 
to support Bosnian Serbs in their just struggle for survival," 
Lilic said. 
  "International media had been demonizing Bosnian Serbs and 
fabricating lies about them although all relevant international 
factors are very well aware that Bosnian Serbs have been trying 
very hard from the very outset of the war to help find a 
peaceful settlement as soon as possible." 
  To show their readiness to conclude peace, the Serbs have so 
far offered considerable territorial concessions to the Moslems, 
withdrawn their heavy artillery from around Sarajevo and agreed, 
on certain conditions, that the city be administered by the 
United Nations, but this has not satisfied the Moslems, Lilic 
said.

  [Text] New York, 8 Mar (TANJUG) -- "During the period 20-25 
February, NATO planes violated the airspace of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] on several occasions, threatening 
its sovereignty and territorial integrity, with possible 
unforeseeable consequences," Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav 
Jovanovic says in a letter forwarded to UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali on Tuesday. 
  Jovanovic draws the secretary general's attention to the 
fact 
that the airspace violations took place in the area of Boka 
Kotorska and near Uzice and Kraljevo, and said this was an 
integral part of a campaign of continuous pressure on the Serb 
nation. 
  "We are particularly concerned because all this is happening 
under the auspices of the United Nations and because nothing has 
been done yet to stop such provocations," the letter says. "If 
these violations continue they could spark off incidents with 
unforeseeable consequences for the security of not only the FRY 
but also the entire Balkan region, including the peace process 
aimed at ending the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  Jovanovic appealed to Butrus-Ghali to take appropriate 
measures within the framework of the United Nations and NATO to 
prevent "such dangerous provocations" in the future.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 8 (TANJUG) -- The Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia will not allow the arrival of permanent missions 
of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) 
in its territory until it is readmitted as a full member of this 
organization because this country refuses to be an object which 
will only carry out decisions which it has not made, the 
Yugoslav Minister for Human Rights and Rights of Minorities, 
Margit Savovic, said on Tuesday. 
  She, however, underscored that this stand does not mean that 
certain missions will not be allowed to come, but only on 
condition that they announce they are arriving in Yugoslavia, 
and not in Kosovo (Serbia's southern province), Vojvodina 
(Serbia's northern province) or the Raska region (southeast 
region in Serbia, Turkish name Sandzak). 
  Savovic said that there had been attempts that the 
activities 
of permanent missions be carried out by the representatives of 
several embassies in Yugoslavia, who had even submitted reports 
about their findings. They were, however, warned that this is 
out of the question. 
  Yugoslavia also cannot accept the proposal by a Swedish 
independent foundation that U.N. civilian rule be imposed in 
Kosovo due to the alleged human rights violations in this 
Serbian province, because this represents an attempt to 
internationalize the situation in Kosovo and impose a U.N. 
protectorate in Yugoslavia, the minister said. 
  The same or similar reasons exist for refusing a permanent 
UNESCO representative in Kosovo to help organize the situation 
in the province's education system, because this is an internal 
affair which should be resolved through talks rather than 
internationalization, Savovic said. 
  For decades the Albanian separatists in Kosovo have been 
trying to secede this province from Serbia, i.e. Yugoslavia, and 
annex it to neighbouring Albania. The Albanian separatists are 
also using classical terrorist tactics of attacking the police 
and army. 
  A letter by the Islamic Organization Conference to the U.N. 
Security Council about the violation of the human rights of the 
allegedly indigenous 'Bosnian Moslem' population in Raska 
(Sandzak), also represents interference in Yugoslavia's internal 
affairs together with a statement by Moslem leader Alija 
Izetbegovic that the so-called 'Moslem national council of 
Sandzak' should be included in the talks on the resolution of 
the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, Savovic said. 
  Raska is a region divided between Montenegro, Serbia and the 
ex- Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is mainly 
populated by Moslems. Extremist Moslem leaders are persistently 
trying to annex this region to the Bosnian Moslem territories. 
Throughout the entire war in Bosnia, the Raska Moslems have 
supplied the Bosnian Moslems with weapons and manpower. 
  The Yugoslav human rights minister said that the Yugoslav 
government would write to the U.N. Human Rights Commission to 
deny a draft resolution by this commission, as well as 84 
letters to this international body, about the alleged human 
rights violations and ethnic cleansing in Vojvodina and southern 
Baranja. 
  Hungarians are the biggest ethnic majority in the Vojvodina 
province and they enjoy the same rights as all Yugoslav citizens. 
  Asked about the work of the international war crimes 
tribunal 
in The Hague, Savovic said that this court would be more 
acceptable if it had a universal character, and did not deal 
solely with war crimes committed in the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Savovic said that lists consisting mainly of Serb names are 
being compiled for the Hague court and underscored that 
Yugoslavia will not extradite its citizens because this is 
prohibited by its constitution. All war criminals will be tried 
in Yugoslav courts according to Yugoslav laws.

  The charge d'affairs of the German Embassy in Belgrade was

the German Government's decision on the mass deportation of 
Yugoslav citizens from Germany. 
  The German charge d'affairs stressed that the media reports 
on the expulsion of a large number of people were unfounded, 
that the number of the so-called asylum-seekers was not so 
large, and that deportation measures would be applied only 
against those who are in Germany illegally. 
  The German charge d'affairs was told that the method 
announced to deport the Yugoslavs is not acceptable, that it 
would represent the violation of human rights and international 
conventions, and that the deportation measures have been adopted 
in a discriminatory fashion without prior consultations with the 
Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on solving 
complex humanitarian problems. The Federal Government has taken 
certain steps with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees with 
regard to this issue.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 9 (TANJUG) -- Airlines from The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] and Slovenia will 
again use air corridors over the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
(F.R.Y.), after they announced settling of their dues over which 
the Belgrade flight control denied to provide them with its 
services as of March 1. 
  "The ban on flights over the F.R.Y. is still in force for 
some Turkish airlines, but the talks are underway and we hope 
the matter will be resolved to mutual satisfaction," said Branko 
Bilbija, the director of the Federal Flight Control Office. 
  He said that several national airlines tried to avoid paying 
the office's service fees by invoking international sanctions 
against the F.R.Y. 
  In the overall debt of millions of dollars incurred to the 
Federal Flight Control Office, Macedonia's share is said to 
amount to 2.5 million dollars. 
  Bilbija underscored that no U.N. Security Council's 
resolution banned flying through the F.R.Y. airspace, using or 
paying for the services of the Belgrade flight control. 
  He said that charging the airlines for their services was 
the 
only source of the office's income, which they spend on 
equipment and wages. Owing to that, he added, they maintained 
very high technical, technological and security standards. 
  The Federal Flight Control Office report said that during 
1993, 150,000 aircraft owned by 150 world airlines had used the 
F.R.Y. air routes. 
  In May 1992, the U.N. Security Council banned international 
flights of the Yugoslav JAT Airlines.

  [Text] A meeting between representatives of the Democratic 
Left Alliance [SLD] and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] has just 
ended at the Parkowa hostel in Warsaw. 
  [Reporter] A meeting of the SLD-PSL coalition is over. 
According to Jerzy Szmajdzinski, the coalition members 
acquainted themselves with the sociopolitical situation in 
Poland in the context of the spreading strike action by 
Solidarity. The government's readiness for talks with 
Solidarity has been reiterated. The SLD presented to Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak a proposal that the deputy prime 
minister and finance minister portfolios be given to Dariusz 
Rosati. 
  As Szmajdzinski put it, the prime minister received the 
proposal in silence. It was agreed that, before the end of this 
week, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak will hold a longer 
conversation with the candidate for deputy prime ministership. 
During this conversation, Pawlak will agree on conditions for 
cooperation with the new finance minister. 
  Journalists asked if the coalition members also discussed 
clauses in the Budget Law that oblige the Ministry of National 
Defense to purchase equipment only from Polish arms 
manufacturers. Answering this question, Jerzy Szmajdzinski 
stated that the SLD expects Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk to 
indicate all of his reservations concerning the budget of his 
ministry during the Senate debate on the budget. 
  During the evening meeting, the coalition members also 
discussed sending the concordat to the Sejm.

<F P=106> [Article by "km": "Diplomats Will Apparently Not Permit </F>
Arms Manufacturers To Sell on the Iranian Market"] 
  [Text] The possibility that the RDP Group of Czech arms 
manufacturers could negotiate exports to Iran of repair 
technology for the T-72 tank is apparently not very likely. 
  RDP Group Director General Jan Vlcek asked Industry and 
Trade 
Minister Vladimir Dlouhy to make the political decision whether 
his company may enter the Iranian market. Minister Dlouhy, 
according to his spokesman Kamil Cermak, is awaiting, however, 
the stance of Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec and Defense 
Minister Antonin Baudys. 
  A source from diplomatic circles, who does not wish to be 
identified, told MLADA FRONTA DNES yesterday that the Foreign 
Ministry intends to honor international obligations and, on 
principle, not export arms to high-risk regions. Although Iran 
is not among the countries to which the sale of arms is banned, 
many countries consider Iran a very high-risk region. "After 
all, the situation in Iran is not calm and clear. It is in the 
interest of the Czech Republic not to support armament in this 
region," the diplomat added. 
  "The RDP Group does not want to export tanks to Iran; it has 
never even considered it. The consortium discussed the 
possibility of supplying repairs technology for these tanks," 
RDP Group press spokesman Jiri Vich specified. The planned deal 
with Iran should revive some stagnating enterprises. The 
expected financial volume of this order, which should be filled 
over five years, allegedly amounts to $0.5 billion. 
  The RDP Group even founded its own bank, TOPFIN. By means of 
this consortium of small and medium-sized banks, the 
arms-manufacturing company should finance its production and 
business transactions.

  [Text] Belgrade, 8 Mar (TANJUG) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic has received Charles Redman, U.S. President 
Clinton's special envoy, who arrived in Belgrade today. They 
exchanged views on the current phase of the peace process in 
Bosnia, particularly in light of the Washington agreement on 
creating a Muslim-Croat federation. 
  After an hour and a half of talks with Milosevic, Redman 
said: "We have reached a very important phase in the process, 
which should result in a comprehensive solution to the Bosnian 
conflict, something that will contribute to the stability of the 
entire region." 
  Recalling U.S. involvement in the peace process in Bosnia 
and 
the agreement on a Muslim-Croat federation, Redman said things 
on the ground were progressing successfully, adding in support 
of this claim that the disengagement of Muslim and Croat forces 
had already begun in central Bosnia. 
  "Today's talks with President Milosevic were the first 
exchange of views," Redman said, and added: "My intention was to 
be sure that President Slobodan Milosevic fully acknowledged and 
understood what we are doing in the Muslim-Croat agreement." 
  According to the special envoy of the U.S. President, it is 
time to work quickly to find a comprehensive solution to the 
Bosnian conflict: "We believe that all regional elements can 
play an important role in seeking a comprehensive solution. We 
believe that President Milosevic, as well as other regional 
leaders, will be actively involved in the second phase of the 
peace process." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prague, March 4 (CTK) -- Positive evaluation of the 
recent developments in Sarajevo, but also the critical nature of 
the overall situation in the area, were clearly heard during 
discussion at the 25th session of the Committee of Senior 
Officials of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE), General Secretary Wilhelm Hoynck told journalists 
today. 
  The session has been going on in the Cernin Palace in Prague 
since Wednesday [2 March] ends today. The situation in the 
former Yugoslavia was a key question of the session, Hoynck said. 
  Hoynck said it was emphasised that the only real way out was 
a complex solution, and this could only be achieved through 
close cooperation by the international community and the 
recognition of the constructive role which could be played by 
all its components. The CSCE could play a new role here, 
especially in the sphere of human rights and freedoms and above 
all by establishing ombudsmen appointed and supported by the 
CSCE. Negotiations were also going on for the renewal of CSCE 
missions in Kosovo, Sandzak and Vojvodina. 
  The participants of the session approved a decision to renew 
the activity of the CSCE mission in Georgia, and to enable it to 
monitor the peacekeeping forces in South Osetia and Georgia and 
widen its mandate. They expressed themselves in favour of an 
active role for this mission in stimulating dialogue between the 
sides involved in the conflict by organising round-table talks. 
They also favoured the arrangement of an international 
conference under the aegis of the CSCE and with UN participation. 
  Hoynck also talked about the necessity for close cooperation 
between the CSCE missions in South Osetia and Abkhazia. He 
pointed in particular to the humanitarian aspect to the 
problematic situation of this area, where thousands of refugees 
needed help which could only be provided to them by the 
international community.

<F P=106> [From BTA's 9 March "Press Review"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sofia, March 9 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov's heart attack yesterday and his hospitalization is in the 
highlights of today's press. Along with reports on his sickness, 
the papers run comments and forecasts on the turn of political 
events in this country. According to NOVINAR, the prime 
minister felt bad as early as Monday [7 March]; the initial 
diagnosis was acute heart insufficiency; a cardiac infarction 
followed. 24 CHASA says Prof. Milan Petrov, boss of the 
Military Medical Academy, denied this report. According to him, 
the premier had only a minor heart attack, yet he declined to 
specify if Berov's life was out of danger. According to 
KONTINENT, Prof. Petrov did not deny "the rumour spreading in 
Sofia of an infarction". Recent exhaustion and pressure are 
seen as a cause of the heart failure, says DUMA. KONTINENT and 
NOVINAR link Berov's heart attack to a stormy cabinet meeting 
Monday, and more specifically to a quarrel between Deputy Prime 
Ministers Matinchev and Karabashev on privatization of the 
tourist industry. 24 CHASA says the Prime Minister's sickness 
had nothing to do with "emotional pressure" as a result of that 
meeting, observing that Berov had had heart problems earlier. 
DUMA and TRUD specify the premier has already had two heart 
attacks. According to unofficial forecasts, the prime minister 
will be away on sick leave for at least two months, says 24 
CHASA. 
  "Berov Sick, Matinchev at Helm", says the headline of the 
leader in "TRUD. [sentence as received] The paper cites a prime 
minister order authorizing deputy prime minister to stand in for 
him. Evgeni Matinchev is a representative of the ethnic Turks' 
Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) which had a decisive role 
in voting in the Berov government. This would force Deputy Prime 
Minister Valentin Karabashev into resigning, predicts NOVINAR, 
adding the cabinet row on privatization would lead to its 
downfall. In a brief statement on national radio this morning, 
Karabashev denied rumours of his upcoming resignation, saying 
the prime minister did nothing out of the way by asking one of 
his deputies to stand in for him during his sick leave. Small 
wonder if the long and forcibly forestalled cabinet crisis sets 
in, says a signed comment in STANDART NEWS. Leaders of DPS and 
the anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) are alarmed 
about a likely complication of the political situation in case 
of inability by Berov to lead the cabinet, says DUMA. 
DEMOKRATSIYA says leaders of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) 
yesterday met with Deputy Prime Minister Matinchev. They, 
however, said they did not discuss implications of the premier's 
illness. The paper quotes Yanaki Stoilov MP of BSP as saying it 
was accidental that Socialists yesterday discussed the 
pre-election situation and the need for passing a new election 
law and a regional and urban planning law. KONTINENT writes that 
DPS will take a final stand on the Berov cabinet at an 
extraordinary meeting on March 18. In the days to March 18, it 
will try to find a solution to the tobacco harvest purchasing 
issue, hand in hand with the cabinet. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vidin, March 6 (BTA correspondent) -- The Bulgarian 
ship Khan Koubrat towing six barges loaded with 6,000 tonnes of 
oil left Bulgarian territorial waters at 3 a.m. on Sunday, BTA 
learned from the State Shipping Inspectorate. It was followed 
by two patrol boats of the Western European Union (WEU) and a 
patrol boat of the Bulgarian border troops upstream to kilometre 
845 at the Timok River. The ship disobeyed orders to stop. 
  Official sources who declined to be named said that today at 
noon the ship called at the Serb port of Prahovo where the 
unloading of the fuel began. This is the first armed hijacking 
of a ship in the history of Bulgarian river shipping, according 
to reliable sources, provided it is not a sham. 
  As the ship passed Vidin yesterday, two persons could be 
seen 
on deck pointing a gun and a pistol at seven crew members who 
held their hands up. 
  All papers of the ship were left behind at the port of 
Somovit and the regional prosecutor's office in Nikopol, which 
was expected to rule on a document crime consisting in the entry 
of a new discharge port in the shipping documents. 
  The fate of the crew is unknown. If kidnapped at gun point, 
they should be let free to return to Bulgaria. 
  This morning Vidin customs representatives met WEU monitors 
in Calafat (Romania) to discuss the incident. Customs Chief 
Nedyalko Yolov declined to give official information. 
  The Council of Ministers today said the Khan Koubrat had 
crossed Bulgaria's western border with its cargo, entering the 
Serb section of the Danube. After intensive talks it was 
decided not to use force to free the hostages and stop the ship 
so as to avoid the risk of bloodshed and pollution of the Danube 
by a possible explosion, the government's press office also 
said. Vesselin Blagoev, chief secretary of the Council of 
Ministers, said the competent authorities are working on the 
case. 
  The Khan Koubrat and six barges carrying 6,000 tonnes of oil 
were detained by WEU monitors near Calafat on January 31 on 
suspicion of sanctions-busting. Pending a ruling by the Nikopol 
regional prosecutor's office, the ship was held under customs 
control at the port of Somovit. On the night of March 3, it 
sailed undocumented westward to Romanian and Yugoslav 
territorial waters, apparently hijacked according to eyewitness 
accounts of representatives of the Vidin customs and the State 
Shipping Inspectorate and of BTA's local correspondent. The 
possibility of a sham hijacking cannot be ruled out. 
  Later on the Foreign Ministry's press office said the 
ministry had been assigned to inform the UN Sanctions Committee 
of the incident, to take the necessary steps to repatriate the 
crew, ship and cargo, and to have the hijackers handed over by 
the country where they will seek refuge. According to the 
border troops and WEU mission leaders, armed persons aboard the 
ship had forced the crew to steer to Bulgaria's western border, 
the Foreign Ministry's press release says. The information by 
the WEU mission leaders that there might be foreign nationals 
among the hijackers has not been confirmed so far by the 
investigation launched by the competent Bulgarian authorities, 
according to the Foreign Ministry. 
  The Bulgarian authorities took steps to stop the ship as 
soon 
as the violation of the customs ban was established. They were 
assisted by the Romanian authorities, monitors of the WEU 
mission and the Sanctions Assistance Mission, the Foreign 
Ministry said. All attempts to stop the train of vessels were 
unsuccessful.

March 6, the Bulgarian Embassy in Belgrade contacted the Foreign 
Ministry of Yugoslavia (Serbia-Montenegro) asking the Yugoslav 
authorities to provide assistance in the arrest and 
identification of the hijackers of the Khan Kubrat, in ensuring 
the safety of the crew and the inviolability of the ship and its 
cargo, and in returning them to Bulgaria, BTA learned from the 
Press Centre of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry. The same 
request was made to the Yugoslav Embassy in Sofia. 
  Bulgaria's permanent representation to the United Nations in 
New York was instructed to inform the UN Sanctions Committee 
about the case, the Foreign Ministry's Press Centre informed. 
  Passing Vidin on March 6, the Bulgarian vessel Khan Kubrat 
disobeyed orders to stop for a check and threatened to blow up 
if forced to do so. Two armed men were seen on board the ship 
holding its 7-member crew at gun point. The vessel is carrying 
6,000 tonnes of diesel oil and has already left Bulgaria's 
territorial waters. Detained on January 31 by patrol boats 
operated by the Western European Union on suspicion of trying to 
break the embargo on Serbia-Montenegro, it was waiting the 
Regional Prosecutor's Office to rule if the Khan Kubrat's was a 
case of embargo busting or not in the port of Somovit. On the 
night of March 3 to March 4 the vessel slipped out of port 
leaving all its papers behind. 
  Yesterday the Bulgarian Government stated that after 
intensive discussions a decision had been made not to use force 
to liberate the hostages and stop the ship in order to avoid a 
risk of bloodshed and pollution of the Danube River in case of 
an eventual explosion.

  [Excerpts] Sofia, March 7 (BTA) -- The Bulgarian Embassy 
in Belgrade contacted the Foreign Ministry of Yugoslavia 
(Serbia-Montenegro), asking the Serbian authorities to provide 
assistance in the arrest and identification of the hijackers of 
the Khan Kubrat, in ensuring the safety of the crew and the 
inviolability of the ship and its cargo, and in returning them 
to Bulgaria, BTA learned from the Press Centre of the Bulgarian 
Foreign Ministry. The Yugoslav Embassy in Sofia was approached 
with the same request. [passage omitted] 
  National radio reported that at a meeting of Mr. Konstantin 
Andreev, Head of the Foreign Ministry's Southern Europe 
Department, and Mr. Smilkovic, charge d'affaires of Yugoslavia 
in Sofia, the Bulgarian diplomat had been assured of the Serbian 
authorities' readiness to assist in the arrest and 
identification of the hijackers, in ensuring the crew's safety 
and the vessel's inviolability and in returning it to Bulgaria. 
  An official source who asked not to be identified told the 
BTA correspondent in the Danubian town of Vidin (northwestern 
Bulgaria) that the Khan Kubrat, hijacked on March 3 at about 
22:00 hrs. from the port of Somovit, had already reached the 
port of Prahovo in Serbia. Prahovo is the first Serbian 
liquid-fuel terminal upstream from the Bulgarian section of the 
Danube. The communication came from members of the sanctions 
assistance mission in Turnu Severin, Romania. According to it, 
the hijacked Bulgarian vessel came to a berth at about 200 m. 
from the fuel-discharging facilities at about 05:00 hrs. on 
March 6, but it is not known if the 6,000 tonnes of diesel fuel 
it carries have been unloaded. 
  Another official source says that the fuel has not been 
unloaded yet and that the governments of Bulgaria and Serbia 
have reached an agreement to keep the vessel loaded until the 
case is clarified. No information is available about the fate 
of the crew and the armed men on board the ship. 
  "It is a very bizarre case," said Rainer Boyssel of the EC 
Monitor Mission. "I believe that organized crime is involved. 
I do not blame the Bulgarian Government. Embargo busting can 
be extremely profitable. This business has a very good reason 
to exist. I am sure the Bulgarian Government has nothing to do 
with it, and I hope that the investigation will detect the 
truth," he said in an interview on national television. 
"Western European monitors chose not to halt the vessel to 
avoid pollution of the river in case it was blown up," he 
explained.

  [Text] Sofia, March 8 (BTA) -- On March 6, at 5.50 AM, the 
Khan Kubrat ship called at the port of Prahovo, Bulgaria's 
Embassy in Belgrade said, quoting official Serb sources. Reports 
said the ship towing 6 barges loaded with 5,136 tonnes of fuel 
were placed under surveillance and the fuel was not unloaded. 
This was done to meet the request of the Bulgarian captain, a 
Foreign Ministry spokesman said today. Ways for bringing back 
the ship, the barges and the crew are being considered at the 
moment at Bulgaria's insistence. 
  The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry and the Bulgarian Embassy in 
Belgrade continue their efforts to clear up the circumstances on 
the Khan Kubrat case, the spokesman also said. 
  The Khan Kubrat ship and the barges were detained by 
monitors 
of the Western European Union (WEU) near Calafat, Romania, on 
January 31 on suspicion of embargo-busting. Pending a ruling by 
the Nikipol Regional Prosecutor's Office the ship was held under 
customs control at the port of Sumovit, which it left uncleared 
on the night of March 3 to sail to Romanian and Serb territorial 
waters. Customs officials, the State Shipping Inspectorate and 
the local BTA correspondent said the ship was hijacked but did 
not rule out the possibility of a sham hijacking. The cabinet 
on March 6 said that the ship had entered the Serbian section of 
the Danube. A decision was taken not to use force to rescue the 
hostages so as to avoid bloodshed and pollution of the river is 
case the ship was blown up, the Cabinet's press office said. 
The WEU monitors chose not to use their right to halt the ship 
for the same reasons, Monitor Mission Head Rainer Boyssel told a 
BTA reporter last night. According to Mr. Boyssel, organized 
gang groups were to blame for the case and the government was 
not involved. A National Radio report yesterday said that 
meeting with Foreign Ministry's Southeastern Europe Department 
Chief Konstantin Andreev, Yugoslav Charge d'Affaires in Sofia 
Smilkovich expressed the readiness of the Serb authorities to 
assist in the detention of the hijackers, in assuring the crew's 
safety and returning the ship to Bulgaria. 
  Union of the Democratic Forces (SDS) leader Filip Dimitrov 
today said that the SDS parliamentary faction will insist on 
holding a parliamentary hearing on the case and setting up an ad 
hoc commission of inquiry to collect details on Khan Kubrat's 
hijacking.

  [Text] Budapest, 8 March (MTI) -- The Hungarian 
representative in the Danube Commission recently forwarded a 
letter to representatives of the other member states, Hungarian 
Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman announced on Tuesday [8 
March]. 
  In the letter, the Hungarian Government, citing the February 
tragedy of the Ukrainian tugboat, reminded the member states of 
the Danube Commission that the Slovak Government, in serious 
violation of its international contractual obligations, 
rechanneled the Danube river flow in a 40-kilometer section from 
the river's natural bed, previously used for international 
shipping, and has thus prevented navigation on this section. 
  In order to fully enforce the safety and freedom of Danube 
shipping, the Hungarian Government considers it necessary for 
the Danube Commission to call on the Government of the Slovak 
Republic to continuously provide the necessary water amount in 
the natural bed of the Danube in order to restore the original 
conditions of navigation, as was previously demanded by the 
Hungarian side. 
  The Hungarian Government also deems it necessary for the 
Danube Commission to call on Bratislava to restore the official 
announcement system which has not been in force since the 
Gabcikovo facility was unilaterally placed into operation. 
Under the terms of the system, the Danube Commission, and 
through it the governments of the countries concerned, must 
immediately be informed of all circumstantial events -- for 
instance, the serious accident in February. 
  However, the Danube Commission has still not received any 
such notification concerning the Ukrainian boat accident. 
  The Hungarian Government has requested that the Commission 
place these issues on the discussion agenda for the session next 
month.

  [Text] Budapest, 7 March (MTI) -- A heated debate came 
about during the Monday [7 March] session of Hungarian 
Parliament: 
  Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ], the largest opposition party, asked to take the floor 
prior to the agenda. Peto qualified Friday's dismissal of 129 
radio program makers as a politically motivated "cleansing" 
maneuver. "The action announced on Friday by the deputy chairman 
of Hungarian Radio (who is vested with full powers of chairman) 
surpasses in dimensions even the dismissals following the 1956 
uprising," Peto said. 
  The SZDSZ chairman placed the responsibility on the 
government, as the cabinet provided 105 million forints to 
Hungarian Radio to cover severance pay for those dismissed. 
Peto said the Radio deputy chairman took the unlawful step in 
the knowledge that legal remedy will only be possible following 
the elections. 
  The leader of the Hungarian Socialist Party's parliamentary 
group, Zoltan Gal, said the government wants to transform the 
electronic public service institutions into a mouth-piece for 
the values of one single political order. 
  Tamas Deutsch of the Federation of Young Democrats pointed 
to 
the fact that his party had always opposed the appointment of 
the deputy chairmen of Hungarian Radio and Television, and 
consistently held out for Elemer Hankiss and Csaba Gombar, the 
chairmen of the organizations. "The current decision of Radio 
Deputy Chairman Laszlo Csucs has annulled the hope of a clean 
election campaign. The government is now striving to divert the 
public's attention from other inglorious details of its final 
certificate," Deutsch said. 
  Istvan Csurka of the extreme-right Hungarian Justice and 
Life 
Party said he did not write the scenario for the events that 
have taken place in Hungarian Radio, but he did propose similar 
measures back in 1990. 
  Zoltan Kiraly, an independent deputy who is now the chairman 
of the Social Democratic Party of Hungary, called on Laszlo 
Csucs and Television Deputy Chairman Gabor Nahlik to return to 
their original professions (Csucs formerly worked in the Finance 
Ministry and Nahlik was an engineer). 
  The parliamentary group leader of the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum, Ferenc Kulin, said the events do not favor the governing 
coalition, which he claimed indicates that there was no hidden 
governmental agenda behind the measure. 
  He blamed the opposition for the hopeless situation of the 
entire media affair. In his view, the opposition has tried to 
turn the wrangling surrounding the media bill to its own 
advantage. He recalled that a consensus was nearly reached on 
the media bill, as well as on the leaders of radio and 
television holding regular consultations with opposition 
representatives. This agreement in the making was, according to 
Kulin, upset by the opposition's representatives because they 
felt they would be better off if they shifted all responsibility 
in media matters on the government. 
  Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross called the supposition 
that the government and the prime minister played a role in the 
selection of persons to be dismissed ungrounded and false. He 
said the government has no political relations with Istvan 
Csurka, in other words, it does not pass measures based on 
Csurka's scenarios. In conclusion, Boross promised that the 
government would take a stand in all issues which genuinely 
endanger a clean election. 
  The chairmen of Hungarian Television and Hungarian Radio, 
Elemer Hankiss and Csaba Gombar -- both sociologists -- were 
appointed with the approval of the parliamentary parties by the 
president of the republic, on August 1, 1990, at the proposal of 
the prime minister. Barely one year later, the representatives 
of the governing coalition parties qualified both as unsuited to 
fulfil their posts. 
  In March 1992, at the request of the prime minister, the 
president of the republic appointed deputy chairmen to head both 
institutions. In May 1992, the two chairmen were summoned for 
hearings by Parliament's Cultural Committee, to re-examine their 
suitability. The government-party majority in the committee, 
citing unsuitability, proposed that the presidents be relieved. 
  The prime minister forwarded the committee's proposal to the 
president of the republic, who refused to relieve the Radio and 
Television chairmen from their posts. Five months later, the 
government initiated disciplinary action against the chairman of 
Hungarian Television. The disciplinary committee, led by the 
minister of justice, duly suspended Television Chairman Elemer 
Hankiss in December of 1992. Hankiss argues with the legality 
of the proceedings and has since been trying to prove his case 
through legal channels. 
  The president of the republic became the target of attacks 
by 
the ruling parties and by right-wing political forces not 
represented in Parliament because he would not relieve the two 
media chairmen. 
  In January 1993, the two media chairmen asked the president 
of the republic to relieve them of their posts, but the 
president has not fulfilled their requests to this day. 
  Under the terms of a government decree from 1974, the public 
service media are under the supervision of the government, thus 
the prime minister relieved the two media chairmen on the basis 
of this decree and invested the two deputy chairmen with full 
authority of chairmen. 
  At Hungarian Television, the deputy chairman exercising the 
rights of chairman took the alternative news program off the 
air, and has dismissed the news crew accused of being 
sympathetic to the opposition. 
  Hungarian Radio has now dismissed 129 staff members who were 
mainly known to have prepared programs of a critical tone.

  [Text] Budapest, 8 March (MTI) -- The Hungarian Government 
and the governing parties do not strive to monopolize and occupy 
the public service mass media, the National Information Office 
(OIH) of the Prime Minister's Office said in an analysis sent to 
MTI today. 
  Entitled "What Happened in Hungarian Radio?", the document 
states that the Hungarian Government is not in a position to 
directly intervene in the management of Hungarian Radio. 
Precisely due to the forthcoming elections, the governing 
parties would have been interested in postponing the required 
workforce cuts until the post- election period. 
  According to the analysis, the radio deputy chairman's 
decision to dismiss 129 members of the staff was motivated by 
financial and ethical considerations, the reasoning of which had 
to be understood by the government, as well. The present 
situation would not have come about, the analysis says, if 
President Arpad Goncz had relieved the chairmen of Hungarian 
Radio and Hungarian Television of their posts after they asked 
him to do so on January 6, 1993, and if the attitude of the 
opposition parties had not prevented enactment of a media law. 
  The document says that there are only a few papers and 
programs in Hungary in which government officials can speak in 
the awareness that they will not be subjected to the methods of 
intentional and one-sided distortion. Since the leaders and 
editors of the majority of national and provincial papers have 
retained their previous positions, 80 to 85 percent of the press 
follows an opposition (usually left-wing) line, the document 
says. The OIH excludes the chance that this situation, 
detrimental to the government, would or could become a relic of 
the past. 
  Reacting to criticism addressed to the government over the 
dismissals, the analysis says, "it would be beneficial if all 
those abroad who have doubts listened to the daily program of 
Hungarian Radio for only a single occasion to decide whether or 
not it is pro- government." 
  The OIH sees it as reasonable that a media company, even one 
belonging to the opposition, should conduct a survey of the 
programs for the coming month. 
  Referring to a recent report by the Hungarian Radio's 
Supervisory Committee, the analysis says, "Hungarian Radio 
continues to give much more coverage to the media debate than is 
justified."

  [Text] Budapest, 7 March (MTI) -- The Budapest Chief 
Public Prosecutor's Office proposed in a civil lawsuit starting 
last Friday [4 March] that the Budapest Metropolitan Court 
dissolve the far-right World National Popular Rule Party (VNP). 
  According to the prosecutorial complaint, read out by Judge 
Mrs Csiky Julianna Szobacsi, the party's aims and deeds sharply 
violate constitutional provisions related to human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, particularly the right to human dignity, 
minority rights, the equality of citizens, and the freedom of 
learning. 
  The party proposes university applicants should state their 
nationality, with Gypsies and Jews to be admitted according to 
their numerical proportion, in addition to ability. 
  In its monthly, MAGYAR TUDAT (HUNGARIAN CONSCIOUSNESS), 
published on November 16, 1993, the VNP (registered on October 
11, 1993) published an article entitled "Justice to Ferenc 
Szalasi", making the fascist takover in Hungary appear as a 
heroic deed. 
  Ferenc Szalasi (1897-1946), leader of the Hungarian fascist 
(Arrow-Cross) party, seized power on October 15, 1944 with 
Hitler's help and introduced a reign of terror to the country. 
He was condemned to death by the Hungarian people's court and 
executed as a war-criminal. 
  At a meeting in Budapest's 13rd district on January 18, 
1994, 
VNP activists incited hatred against Jews and Gypsies living in 
Hungary. The police investigated the case as representing a 
crime of incitement against a community and recently sent 
related documents and an accusation proposal to the court. 
  Party Chairman Albert Szabo and his defender asked the court 
to dismiss the prosecution's complaint as unfounded and denied 
the charge of unconstitutional party operations. 
  Szabo pointed out that newspaper reports on the VNP's 
January 
18 meeting distorted the facts because they are not racists but 
would like to replace predatory capitalism by socialism based on 
national ideas. The trial will continue on April 13.

  [Text] Budapest, 6 March (MTI) -- The United Smallholders 
Party (EKGP) held its third national board meeting this weekend 
to draft its electoral manifesto. The party was formed last 
November through the merger of some breakaway factions of the 
Independent Smallholders' Party (FKGP). 
  The FKGP was originally a member of the governing coalition 
but later on party Chairman Jozsef Torgyan and some other 
deputies went into opposition. Thirty-six Smallholders, 
however, turned against Torgyan and remained in the coalition. 
Some of them are now leaders of the EKGP. 
  The EKGP manifesto lays emphasis on economic development, 
mainly in the provinces, and covers home policy, foreign policy, 
nature protection, education, and health, too. 
  The United Smallholders seek to develop an efficient 
agriculture based on private ownership. To attain this aim, 
they wish to join the next cabinet in any case. The EKGP says 
Hungary's agriculture should be duly prepared for European 
integration, which is an indispensable condition of economic 
growth. 
  The EKGP criticizes the current banking system for its 
failure to finance private farms appropriately. The party is of 
the view that the whole food industry should be transferred to 
the scope of the Ministry of Agriculture. 
  The United Smallholders say the new Parliament should draft 
a 
new Constitution to be confirmed by a referendum. 
  According to the manifesto, the president of the republic 
should be elected in a referendum, and the government controlled 
more efficiently by a bicameral parliament.

  [Text] Budapest, 6 March (MTI) -- "The Federation of Young 
Democrats (Fidesz) is a party of balance and unity, which 
provides a political home for people with different world 
outlooks and ways of thinking," Fidesz Chairman Viktor Orban 
said in Szekesfehervar today. 
  Addressing the first rally of the Young Democrats' election 
campaign, Orban said, "Over the past few years the Fidesz proved 
that it could represent the ideas of political and national 
unity in an authentic way." 
  "The Fidesz was perhaps the first party in the 20th-century 
history of Hungarian liberalism which could reconcile liberalism 
with national commitment," he said. 
  The Fidesz chairman said the country needs a government 
which 
helps stabilize democarcy and is committed to Hungary's soonest 
possible membership in the European Union and NATO. "A liberal 
government has the best chance to cope with the tasks the 
country will face in the coming years," Orban said. 
  Concerning the strengthening of the Socialist Party, Orban 
said most people wish calm, security and a better life rather 
than a return to the past.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 8--Director of the Defence Ministry's 
Legal Department Gen. Kazimierz Nalaskowski said Tuesday that a 
possible appeal by the defence minister to the constitutional 
tribunal against the part of the 1994 budget law which pertains 
to the armed forces may only relate to the final shape of the 
law and may be lodged after the end of the legislative procedure 
i.e. when the budget law is adopted by the Senate and signed by 
the president. 
  Under the law on the constitutional tribunal, ministers are 
not entitled to lodge appeals against the budget law but they 
have the right to ask for support from such entities as the 
cabinet, the prime minister, the Sejm committees and a group of 
50 deputies that are eligible to file appeals against the 
budget, Nalaskowski said. 
  On Monday, Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk told a press 
conference in Bydgoszcz that he would appeal to the 
constitutional tribunal against the budget law adopted by the 
Sejm on Saturday. Kolodziejczyk declared that "what has happened 
to the Defence Ministry's budget this year is scandalous" and 
accused the legislative authorities of deeply interfering in the 
prerogatives of executive power.

  [Text] Gdansk, March 4 -- Defence Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk said in Gdynia Friday he hoped that in May Poland 
would be granted the status of at least an associate-member of 
the Western European Union (WEU). Kolodziejczyk was speaking at 
a press conference shortly after his return from Paris were he 
had held talks with French and German Defence Ministers Francois 
Leotard and Volker Ruehe, respectively. 
  "We return from Paris highly satisfied since we have gained 
more than we have expected, Kolodziejczyk said. [no closing 
quotation mark as received] He also said that Poland has two 
powerful allies who will support its bid for the WEU associate 
status. 
  According to the defence minister, the Polish-French-German 
cooperation in defence is of a great significance to Poland, 
bringing it closer to European security structures. 
  The French meeting, the first of its kind, opened up a new 
stage in the defence cooperation between the three countries. 
It was decided that the French, German and Polish defence 
ministers would hold regular tripartite meetings with the next 
one scheduled to take place in Warsaw in July. These meetings, 
to be held at least once a year, are to be preceded by working 
meetings of military experts, Kolodziejczyk announced. 
  Joint military exercises of Polish, German and French forces 
are also planned for this year. Details of two sets of 
Polish-French manoeuvres to be held in summer are to be 
discussed during a visit to Poland by the chief of the general 
staff of the French Armed Forces scheduled for March 9-12. 
  referring to possible threats to European security, 
Kolodziejczyk pointed mainly to a large military potential 
gathered in the Russian Kaliningrad district and to developments 
in Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine. 
  According to Kolodziejczyk, participation of Russia in the 
"Partnership for Peace" initiative would diminish these dangers. 
He stressed, however, that Russia should firstly meet all 
conditions set by NATO for prospective partners.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES 7/3/1994 -- "The Romanian 
National Unity Party [PUNR] cannot be considered as defeated by 
this government reshuffle," said party's Vice President Ioan 
Gavra, cited by daily ADEVARUL. "As a matter of fact the PUNR 
has to be credited with the change," Ioan Gavra mentioned, 
"because it is us that have awakened the ruling party to 
reality, through this reshuffle and through the implementation 
of the political program. This is the political performance 
number one, especially that a part of the executive's program 
belongs to us." 
  Octavian Cozminca, secretary of state, explains in daily 
ADEVARUL that the government reshuffle was necessary, because 
there was lack of concordance in the process of reform in some 
ministries. "I can assure you that the four ministers are 
competent politicians or technocrats." 
  Corneliu Coposu, president of the Christian Democratic 
National Peasant Party, told the national radio: "I think this 
reshuffle has had a negative impact on public opinion, i.e. it 
is an inconsequential face-lift meant to extend the government's 
agony. The government has not been consolidated with this 
reshuffle, it has gained nothing in point of prestige or 
stability and especially as regards external credibility." 
  Dinu Patriciu, the Liberal Party [PL '93] 1993: "Instead of 
a parliamentary majority that should back a genuinely 
reform-oriented government, the minimal solution was chosen of 
changing some ministers, again in disregard of the Constitution, 
i.e. without having them heard in the parliament. This proves 
that the attitude of the PL '93 was justified and we hope our 
partners in the opposition too, have understood that the talks 
with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] are not 
serious, as they are meant only to mark time, with no serious 
end." 
  Sergiu Cunescu -- the Romanian Social-Democratic Party: "I 
appreciate the power has understood the necessity of appointing 
civilians at the head of the Ministries of the Interior and 
Defence. But we deplore the replacement at the head of the Army 
of General Spiroiu whom we highly regard." 
  Daily ADEVARUL prints General Niculae Spiroiu's statement 
that the decision to change him belongs to the PDSR. "I can 
tell you the Army is under political control." 
  Like President Ion Iliescu announced, General Spiroiu will 
represent Romania at the NATO Headquarters in Brussels, while 
Lieutenant-General George Ioan Danescu will remain with the 
Ministry of the Interior, as the new minister's deputy, thus 
helping with his experience in the modernization of the Ministry. 
  As regards Petre Ninosu and Paul Teodoru, they too, will 
assist for a while in the reorganization of the ministries they 
headed -- justice and transport -- and will then be given other 
assignments.

  [Text] Bucharest. ROMPRES 8/3/1994 -- Oliviu Gherman, 
president of the Party of Social Democracy of Romania, told a 
news conference on 8 March that the recent government reshuffle 
was, "like everywhere in the world and the more so in a country 
in transition, a natural and constitutional way of improving the 
activity of the executive." In that context, Oliviu Gherman 
stressed his party's readiness to continuously improve the 
government activity by associating personalities "adjusted the 
new requirements of the Romanian society." 
  The recent government reshuffle meant the replacement of the 
ministers of defence, the interior, transport, and justice. 
  Ioan Solcanu, vice-president of the ruling party, said that 
his party's negotiations with the Social Democratic Party, the 
Christian Democratic National Peasant Party and the Democratic 
Party (National Salvation Front) were not fortuitous. "Their 
purpose was to probe those parties' attitude in the event that 
the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] would propose a 
minority, one-colour government, improved with technocrats." 
Also, Ioan Solcanu said that the current government reshuffle, 
tacitly accepted by the Romanian National Unity Party, completed 
a first round of consultations, that with the parties of the 
majority parliamentary coalition. For the time being, Ioan 
Solcanu said, the formula proposed by the National Peasant 
Christian Democratic Party (a government formed by the 
PDSR-Democratic Convention and Democratic Party) could not be 
achieved. The PDSR's intention, Ioan Solcanu recognized, was to 
single out through those political dialogues the possibilities 
to speed up the reform through an agreement of the parties of 
the whole political arena.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES 7/3/1994 -- "The government 
whose head I am has a detailed governing programme, drafted on 
the basis of the general one, with actions and measures for the 
year 1994, that has been refined of late," said Premier Vacaroiu 
in an interview with the daily CRONICA ROMANA. 
"Social-democratic in character, the programme lays stress on 
welfare and is by all means reformist." The premier added that 
decisive steps were in view for 1994 as far as restructuring and 
privatisation are concerned. He mentioned that the government 
was open to "a dialogue with political parties in search of 
(restructuring and privatisation) solutions, and, if good ideas 
are expressed, we are definitely ready to take them over." 
  The head of the Romanian executive rejected the "slogan" 
saying that no reform had been carried out in Romania and showed 
that important good things were achieved in 1993 in external 
relations "in consequence of our policy of reform that has been 
known and recognised as such." Premier Vacaroiu admitted that 
"things did not go equally well as regards restructuring and 
privatisation," although "more than 3,000 assets were sold and 
more than 300 small- and middle-sized commercial companies were 
privatised." The pace was too slow, implied Premier Vacaroiu, 
who mentioned that 2,000 of the 6,7000 companies selected for 
privatisation so far would be passed to private hands by making 
use of the vouchers distributed to the population about two 
years ago, for which shares can be bought."

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/3/1994 -- The Bucharest 
newspapers of 9 March comment on Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu's tour of countries in Europe and Asia. "The first stage 
of the new presidential tour" daily LIBERTATEA writes, "was 
Vilnius, Lithuania's capital, where, considering that Romania 
and Lithuania have had similar political evolution and 
principles, Presidents Ion Iliescu and Algirdas Brazauskas 
signed the first Treaty of Friendship and Collaboration between 
the two countries." The government daily VOCEA ROMANIEI 
emphasizes in a commentary entitled "The First Steps Toward 
Rewarding Cooperation" the Lithuanian head of state's assessment 
made during a dinner according to which "this visit has given 
new impetus to the Lithuanian-Romanian relations, materialized 
among other things in bilateral agreements, a political 
agreement included." Also, the Lithuanian head of state 
expressed the confidence that "it is about the first steps on 
the path of a cooperation rewarding for either party." In turn, 
President Iliescu noted that "the visit is a welcome opportunity 
to single out the traditions of the relations between our 
countries and peoples, the similarity of certain moments and 
stages in their remote history." 
  "What seems noteworthy to me," writes the CRONICA ROMANA 
special envoy, "is the moment at which Romania is signing the 
treaty with Lithuania, a country which has not regretted for a 
moment its disjoining from the CIS. The contacts between 
Romanian and Lithuanian businessmen proved promising for either 
party. A fine winter tale has been written in Vilnius, of two 
countries that are being united faster and more thoroughly than 
we could suspect, by their poverty and problems. And they, the 
Lithuanians, are close enough for the relations between the two 
countries to follow the growth confirmed through the treaty 
signed yesterday". 
  The DIMINEATA envoy in Vilnius opines in his dispatch that 
"the presence of Romania's president in the Lithuanian capital 
and especially the political Treaty of Friendship and 
Collaboration between the two states have meanings that cannot 
be missed by analysts. Above all, both states were among the 
first (Romania was the very first) to sign the Partnership for 
Peace with the NATO and that was not prompted by the wish to 
remake the 'sanitary belt' through which the west seemed to 
isolate the Soviet empire in the inter-bellum period, but in 
order to build a system of relations meant to secure their quiet 
which they need so much in order to build a market economy and a 
state of law, in the lastingness of which they are equally 
interested".

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 7/3/1994 -- A communique issued 
in Bucharest on 7 March informs that, in compliance with the 
recommendation of the Supreme Council of Defense, the Romanian 
Government has adopted a resolution for the appointment, 
organization and functioning of a government board for the 
restructuring of the defense industry. 
  The restructuring of the defense industry is part of the 
reform programme developed by the Government of Romania, and its 
purpose is to adjust production capacities to the technical 
endowment requirements of the forces forming the national 
defense system, as well as to modernize and update certain 
units, to keep under conservation strictly specialized 
equipment, to convert, partly or entirely, some manufacturing 
units, to offer the personnel to be laid-off professional 
readjustment opportunities. 
  The main aim of the government board for the restructuring 
of 
the defense industry is to adapt the defense industry to the new 
demands of the market economy without affecting Romania's 
defense capabilities.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/3/1994 -- The 
widely-circulated bucharest daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, under the 
direction of Ion Cristoiu, has been put under penal inquiry for 
infringement of the law of national security and of Romania's 
Constitution. The daily was sued by the General Prosecution on 
March 8 for having tapped and published phone messages addressed 
to President Ion Iliescu on his birthday. 
  EVENIMENTUL ZILEI front paged on its March 3 issue the 
telephone number at which the head of the Romanian state could 
be congratulated. The daily carried the next day on a whole 
page part of the congratulation messages addressed to President 
Iliescu, which, it said, were "recorded by specific means." 
  The article of the national security law on the basis of 
which EVENIMENTUL ZILEI has been accused says that "... illegal 
possession, fabrication or use of specific means of tapping 
communications and the collecting and release of secret or 
confidential information, by all means other than legal, is an 
infraction and is punished with two up to seven years of 
imprisonment, unless the action is a graver infraction." 
  A page of the March 9 issue of EVENIMENTUL ZILEI is devoted 
to the ... events, including opinions of other publications, 
items of news, comments by politicians. EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, 
which treats the whole thing as a media "joke," also publishes a 
note titled "The Penal Inquiry Against EVENIMENTUL ZILEI Reaches 
Far." It concludes on a humorous note: "Unconscious and 
optimist, we say in sweet ignorance: "Let the dance start in 
roars of laughter."

  [Text] Bucharest, 7 March (MTI) -- Delegates from 
Hungary's main opposition party, the Alliance of Free Democrats 
(SZDSZ), held talks with Viorel Hrebenciuc, general secretary of 
the Romanian Government, Corneliu Coposu, chairman of the 
Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party, Petre Roman, 
chairman of the Democratic Party, Oliviu Gherman, president of 
the Senate and chairman of the ruling Romanian Party of Social 
Democracy, and a group of liberal politicians, including Liberal 
Party 93 acting Chairman Horia Rusu, in Bucharest on Monday [7 
March]. 
  Members of the SZDSZ delegation, headed by the party's 
parliamentary faction head and prime minister candidate Gabor 
Kuncze, told MTI they had raised to Hrebenciuc the problem of 
releasing Transylvanian Hungarian convicts imprisoned in 
connection with the 1989 December revolution in Romania. 
Hrebenciuc said a positive decision is expected in the matter 
soon. 
  SZDSZ delegates stressed that the affair of Romania's ethnic 
Hungarian community and the Hungarian-Romanian basic treaty were 
inseparable from each other. 
  As for the delay in opening new border posts, Hrebenciuc 
said 
construction will begin between Battonya and Turnu, and between 
Mehkerek and Salonta, with further crossings in the offing. 
  Coposu said his party sticks to the principles laid down in 
the 1918 Alba Iulia declaration stating that Romanian Hungarians 
are entitled to the same rights as the Romanians, with special 
regard to education, including the opportunity of pursuing 
higher studies in the native language.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 7/3/1994 -- The president of 
the Romanian Senate, Oliviu Gherman, received Monday, 7 March, a 
delegation of the Alliance of the Free Democrats of Hungary 
[SZDSZ], led by Gabor Kuncze, leader of a parliamentary faction 
and its candidate for premiership. 
  The sides talked about the necessity to strengthen the 
bilateral parliamentary ties as a basic element for the 
improvement of the Romanian-Hungarian relations. 
  Oliviu Gherman termed the inexistence of interparliamentary 
relations of the ruling party and the opposition forces in 
Romania with their counterparts in Hungary as "illogical and 
contrary to bilateral interests" and said that as long as UDMR 
(Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania -- an ethnic party 
with representation to Romania's Parliament -- e.n.) is the sole 
parliamentary representative of Romania to the Hungarian 
Parliament, the progress in the bilateral parliamentary 
relations will be "insignificant". Gabor Kuncze remarked that, 
given the short time lying before the present Hungarian 
legislative, the bilateral parliamentary relations between the 
two countries could be intensified after the new legislative 
assumes duties. 
  Both sides agreed that all possibilities should be used to 
improve Romanian-Hungarian relations, and that keeping up false 
tensions is to the interest of neither party. The president of 
the Romanian Senate gave assurances to the Hungarian guests 
that, before its term is over, the Romanian legislative body 
will ratify the Romanian-Hungarian agreement for the mutual 
protection of investments.

  [Text] Bratislava March 9 (CTK) -- Slovak President Michal 
Kovac sharply criticised Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar in 
parliament on Wednesday [9 March], accusing Meciar of an attempt 
to dismiss him. Kovac appeared in parliament today with a 
report on the state of the Slovak Republic. 
  "I had and still have nothing against the (ruling Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia of which Meciar is chairman) HZDS and 
the government, but I have serious reservations about the way 
Mr. Meciar governs the country and the practices which create an 
atmosphere of confrontation in political life," Kovac said. He 
stated that at HZDS meetings he was regularly accused of 
"banding together" with the opposition and Hungarians, and of 
"being bribed" by foreign countries. 
  The end of Kovac's address seemed to be a defence of his 
performance as president and an extraordinarily strong criticism 
of the premier's methods of ruling. However, Kovac did not call 
on the parliament, in which the government has lost its 
majority, to dismiss the premier, nor did he urge the premier 
himself to resign. He said that an end should be put to 
denouncing people, and called for political, national and civic 
conciliation. 
  The premier was not present in parliament when Kovac was 
speaking. 
  Kovac assured deputies he would never commit treason "even 
if 
he had to drain the cup of bitterness to the dregs." 
  Observers believe the president's speech could influence 
talks between Meciar's HZDS and the Democratic Left Party (SDL), 
the strongest opposition party, on the government's stability, 
the term of early elections, if they take place, and the 
possibility of expanding the government coalition (now formed by 
the HZDS and the Slovak National Party -- SNS).

  [Text] Bratislava, March 9 (CTK) -- The present Slovak 
cabinet, personified by Premier Vladimir Meciar, was losing the 
"moral claim to legitimacy" which in a democracy is an 
inseparable part of the legitimacy of power, President Michal 
Kovac said in his speech to parliament today. 
  Political power in Slovakia is going through a period of 
severe crisis, ensuing from the gradual loss of a reliable 
government base in parliament and in the ranks of the governing 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Kovac said. Many 
voices, he said, pointed to the autocratic methods of the 
premier's government, adding that "Whoever expresses an opinion 
or standpoint different from that of Vladimir Meciar is 
gradually branded disloyal, unreliable and finally a traitor." 
  Some unethical practices such as slander and not speaking 
the 
truth were being carried over into the whole of society, and not 
even workers in the president's office or the president himself 
were immune to the premier's lunges, Kovac said. 
  "As soon as the premier discovered that I intended to 
perform 
the function of head of state with sovereignty in the spirit of 
the Constitution, he gradually began to ignore me, cast doubt on 
my work and finally set out to influence and discredit, which 
was to result in my being prematurely removed from the post of 
president," he said. 
  "I am not against the HZDS, nor am I against the government. 
I do however have serious reservations about the ethics and 
style of Mr. Meciar's political work, about the methods of his 
government and about the practices which create an atmosphere of 
confrontation in political life," the president stressed. 
  He gave a number of examples of Meciar putting pressure on 
him to carry out state policy in the most immediate interest of 
the HZDS, and that after he refused to do so, Meciar attacked 
him sharply. Also relevant here, he said, was Meciar's 
opposition to Kovac's attempts to meet the heads of district 
authorities. This climaxed in the premier's announcement that 
he would "immediately dismiss those functionaries who accepted 
the invitation. Kovac also recalled Meciar's pressure on him to 
appoint his faithful follower Ivan Lexa privatization minister 
last year. 
  "The premier insisted on the appointment of Lexa, saying 
that 
the HZDS needed money and it had no other means of obtaining it. 
He also promised that he would then dismiss Lexa as soon as he 
had fulfilled his task," Kovac said. He also pointed to the 
dispute concerning the filling of the post of foreign minister, 
the offensive breaking of state protocol concerning the 
president and other clashes. In general, Meciar's approach was 
an "unheard-of limitation of the constitutional rights of the 
head of state," he said. 
  Kovac denied the accusation that he would try to destabilize 
the HZDS or create a new government with the help of 
behind-the-scenes negotiation, and that "he behaved like an 
enemy the whole time." 
  "The chief guilty party on the unstable domestic political 
scene in Slovakia is not the president," Kovac stressed. 
  He then said expressly that he was not calling for the 
dismissal of the current government, and called on Meciar to 
think "seriously and dispassionately" about the criticisms which 
he had made about the premier. He also called on parliamentary 
deputies and all the components of the political spectrum in 
Slovakia to cooperate and bring about national reconciliation in 
the interest of the general welfare of the state.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 7 (CTK) -- The government 
coalition of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and 
the Slovak National Party (SNS) is seeking the support of 
parliamentary parties for early elections being held in June and 
for stabilization of the government, Premier Vladimir Meciar 
said on Monday [7 March]. 
  The HZDS has informed its coalition partner, the SNS, of its 
talks with the opposition Democratic Left Party (SDL) to be held 
this evening, Meciar said. He declined, however, to give 
details on the content of the forthcoming talks, arguing that it 
was to be only "the first official meeting." 
  The SNS considers calling early elections as soon as 
possible 
to be a pre-condition for stabilizing the situation in Slovakia, 
SNS Chairman Jan Slota said. On the SDL negative stand 
concerning its participation in a coalition with Slota, Slota 
said that "the party is the party and Slota is Slota." He said 
that "the Slovak part of the SDL" was aware of the necessity for 
early elections to be held in June due above all to economic 
reasons. "It is clear who in the SDL's deputies' group is of 
what nationality," Slota said regarding the opposition left 
party. 
  Meciar said that coalition talks to be held Tuesday would 
concern the staffing of the foreign ministry and privatization 
ministry. After the dismissal of Jozef Moravcik as foreign 
minister President Kovac refused to appoint Jozef Prokes, SNS 
honorary chairman and deputy premier, as a new foreign minister. 
  Kovac demanded that the post of the minister of the 
administration of national property and its privatization be 
also filled. Meciar had been charged with managing the ministry 
earlier when the president refused to name Ivan Lexa, the state 
secretary in the Privatization Ministry and Meciar's close 
co-worker, the new privatization minister.

  [Text] Bratislava March 8 (CTK) -- Last night's meeting 
between Premier Vladimir Meciar, leader of the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and Peter Weiss, his counterpart from 
the Democratic Left Party (SDL), ended without a concrete 
agreement, HZDS Deputy Chairman Sergej Kozlik and SDL Deputy 
Chairman Milan Ftacnik told journalists on Tuesday [8 March]. 
  The HZDS is the major party in the government coalition and 
the SDL is the largest opposition party. 
  The two men did not reach agreement on the date for the 
early 
elections or the extension of the present coalition, but the 
talks are to continue and a later agreement has not been ruled 
out. 
  The SDL suggests September or October as a "compromise" 
election date while the HZDS sticks to the June term. 
  "We have formed a basis for further alignment," party 
spokesmen said. 
  "The [Slovak National Party] SNS led by Jan Slota is not an 
acceptable partner for the SDL," Ftacnik said, adding that he 
considers finding clear answers to the contents of the political 
agenda on future legislation and social, political and economic 
policy a priority compared with personnel questions. 
  "If Meciar's government agreed to take on certain 
obligations, we could visualise the present cabinet leading the 
country to early elections," Ftacnik said, mentioning wider 
government coalition and replacing the present cabinet with 
another one with or without Meciar's participation as other ways 
to resolve the current political situation. 
  "We remain a party of the opposition," Ftacnik said.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 8 (CTK) -- The Democratic Left 
Party (SDL) is remaining in opposition but is continuing talks 
on solving the current political crisis in Slovakia with all 
suitable political partners, SDL Chairman Peter Weiss told 
journalists on Tuesday [8 March], referring to the results of 
his overnight talks with the leadership of the ruling Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). 
  "We will not join the current government coalition of the 
HZDS and the Slovak National Party (SNS) and this is our 
fundamental position, " Weiss said. He was trying to dismiss 
the impressions about his party possibly shifting into the 
government camp which have been created by his intensive talks 
with Slovak Premier and HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar. 
  However, immediately after that Weiss elaborated that it was 
primarily the SNS which did not suit the SDL in this coalition. 
"We are not even considering government cooperation with the SNS 
as led by Jan Slota," Weiss said, adding that he did not rule 
out other forms of cooperation with the HZDS. 
  SDL Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik admitted that the HZDS 
tried to persuade his party into joining the current government 
coalition with the promise of highest state offices including 
the office of president for Weiss during the talks. 
  "If such an offer has been made it has been rejected. But I 
am not saying it was made," Ftacnik said. 
  Meciar has allegedly acquainted the SDL leadership with his 
idea about the filling of the foreign minister post. Ftacnik 
refused to give the names of the three people discussed but said 
that one of them was a woman. According to journalists' circles 
Minister of Labor, Social Affairs and Family Olga Keltosova 
could be that woman. 
  Pressed by journalists, Weiss confirmed his recent critical 
statements characterizing the HZDS as a "a pro-state vulgar 
right-wing movement." But he explained his turn in the 
direction of possible cooperation with the HZDS by the fact that 
the HZDS "won the elections and still enjoys considerable 
support from the public." "The time when a political adversary 
should be necessarily stamped on and destroyed has passed," 
Weiss said. 
  He said that at talks with the HZDS the SDL concentrated 
mainly on achieving an agreement on what legislative processes 
were to be concluded before possible early elections and what 
are to be handed over to a new parliament. The SDL rejects any 
changes to the constitution, to the current administrative 
division of Slovakia and any restructuring of the state 
administration or of its individual structures, he said. 
  The SDL does not, however, refuse to cooperate with the 
opposition, Weiss said, adding that he was going to inform the 
opposition parliamentary parties about his last night's talks 
with Meciar in the evening.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 5 (CTK) -- A call to the 
"democratic forces in the Slovak Parliament" was adopted by the 
opposition Alliance of Slovak Democrats (AD SR) at its meeting 
in Trebisov, east Slovakia. 
  The AD SR, headed by former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko, 
former aide of Premier Vladimir Meciar and currently his radical 
opponent, called on the opposition to make another attempt to 
pass the constitutional law on early elections. 
  Two recent attempts failed as it was not able to obtain the 
90 votes necessary for this. 
  "The political crisis in Slovakia is intensifying, while the 
latest steps by the governing forces are jeopardising the 
long-term economic and political interests of the country," says 
the appeal by the leadership of the AD SR which has eight 
deputies in the 150-member Slovak Parliament. 
  The AD SR considers the referendum on the the loss of 
mandates of the deputies who left their parties during the 
electoral term to be unconstitutional. 
  The AD SR call assured that if the current government is 
dismissed, it would support a broad coalition government which 
would lead Slovakia to the early elections which should be held, 
according to the AD SR, in autumn.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 4 (CTK) -- The case of Ivan Lexa, 
who was prosecuted for the alleged defamation of the Slovak 
president, has been dropped, Slovak Radio announced on Friday [4 
March]. 
  Lexa is state secretary for privatisation and head of the 
Government Office. 
  The radio quoted Lexa as saying he was informed about the 
decision in a letter from the Police Investigations Office. 
  Following Slovak President Michal Kovac's refusal last 
November to appoint Lexa, who is a close associate of Premier 
Vladimir Meciar's, as the privatisation minister, Lexa publicly 
questioned Kovac's expertise and morale, which led to the 
prosecution. 
  After a lengthy investigation, Lexa was found to be innocent 
under criminal law and was referred to a district court for 
consideration on a breach of regulations punishable by a fine. 
  His prosecution was sanctioned by the alleged violation of 
the articles 102 and 103 on defamation of the republic and the 
president of the republic. Bearing in mind the Helsinki 
Citizens' Committee efforts aimed at the removal of the two 
articles from the Slovak Criminal Code, the Slovak Government 
meanwhile raised the matter in parliament but the passage of a 
respective amendment was blocked by opposition deputies who 
thought the government proposal was a ploy intended to free 
Lexa, a man of the government, of the accusations.

and rate its military cooperation positively, according to the 
results of a January poll conducted by the Slovak Statistical 
Office. 
  Fifty-six percent of respondents, on the other hand, think 
Slovakia's economic performance internationally has been 
unsuccessful. 
  The activity of Slovak embassies abroad is judged as a 
disappointment by 42 percent. Twenty-nine percent think there 
are still too few embassies and consulates abroad, while 12 
percent reckon there are too many. 
  Slovaks are most satisfied with the performance of Slovak 
sportsmen abroad and the representation of Slovak culture, with 
two-thirds rating it positively.

The young Albanians are ignoring the induction notices because 
they don't want to serve in the army "of a neighbouring

call-ups is to apply pressure on the Albanian young men to force 
them to abandon Kosova.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 9 (TANJUG) -- Americans have 
invested all their political credibility in finding a 
comprehensive settlement to the conflict in the war-torn former 
Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina after their own 
prescription. 
  Judging by the U.S. President's special envoy Charles 
Redman's visit to Belgrade on Tuesday, the Americans seem to be 
very anxious to find the solution, but, at the moment, they fail 
to come up with a clear conception of how to give a definite 
shape to the peace package. 
  The reason for the U.S. anxiousness is obviously a result of 
its wish to neutralize, as efficiently as possible, the Russian 
initiative in seeking a solution to the Bosnian conflict. 
  Following the talks with Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic, Redman indicated two phases of the peace process. He 
said that the first phase, which was almost finished, would 
complete a Moslem-Croat deal on setting up a federation made up 
of territories controlled by the two peoples and its later 
entering into a confederation with Croatia. The key to the 
solution, however, could not be found before reaching the 
following (second) phase, for which the U.S. needs the 
participation of the third warring nation, i.e., the Serbs. 
  Redman's visit to Belgrade was a "feel the pulse" operation 
and an attempt to solve essential matters "in passing." It is 
hard to tell whether the U.S. official, while conferring with 
Milosevic and later with Bosnian Serb Republic Vice-President 
Nikola Koljevic, had found out what he came to Belgrade for. It 
was made clear to him, however, that the Moslem-Croat agreement 
is not binding for the Serb side. 
  Redman in Belgrade insisted on "an overall settlement" of 
the 
Bosnian crisis, but failed to specify what exactly he meant by 
that. He was also told that under the circumstances it was very 
hard for the Bosnian Serbs to take an integral stand. 
  The statements he made in Belgrade differ a great deal from 
a 
statement by U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith. 
Redman, for instance, categorically argued that the 
Moslem-Croat agreement was not aimed against the Bosnian Serbs. 
On the other hand, Galbraith on Tuesday told the press 
conference in Zagreb the agreement's main aim was to put an end 
to the senseless conflict between the two nations, victims of 
the Serb aggression. 
  At a point when Redman tried to persuade the Bosnian Serbs 
of 
the necessity of their involvement in the latest peace process, 
Galbraith has offered them only an alternative -- either to join 
the Moslem-Croat agreement and the West, or to continue the war. 
  Be that as it may, Charles Redman left unfinished the job he 
came to Belgrade for, so he is likely to come back for talks 
shortly. 
  Meanwhile, the Russians don't sit on their hands, either. 
Bosnian Moslem Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian 
Foreign Minister Mate Granic were in Moscow on Wednesday. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. State 
Secretary Warren Christopher are scheduled to meet next Monday. 
To all appearances, the situation would somewhat clear up only 
after all these talks about the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Geneva, March 9 (TANJUG) -- The Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia on Wednesday appealed to the U.N. High Commission for 
Refugees (UNHCR) to do everything in its power to prevent the 
forceful expulsion of Yugoslav citizens from Germany and that 
their status is determined before that. 
  The permanent Yugoslav mission at the Geneva U.N. 
headquarters sent a letter to U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees Sadako Ogata saying that Germany has not officially 
informed the Yugoslav authorities about its intention for the 
mass expulsion of Yugoslav citizens -- Serbs, Montenegrins and 
Albanians, who are being denied refugee status. 
  In question are 200,000 people whose requests for asylum in 
Germany were rejected, the letter said. 
  It underscored that Yugoslavia will not prevent the return 
of 
its citizens who have the correct documents, but warned that 
those persons who do not fulfill the requirements of the 
Yugoslav law, will not be able to enter Yugoslav territory. 
  If Germany expels such persons, UNHCR should prepare camps 
for them in Romania, the letter said. 
  If Germany carries out its threats, UNHCR should also act in 
Yugoslav territory to prevent the deterioration of the already 
grave situation regarding the refugees. 
  In Yugoslavia there are some 600,000 registered refugees 
from 
the breakaway ex-Yugoslav republics, and estimates are that 
there are at least 200,000 unregistered refugees living with 
relatives and friends. 
  Yugoslavia believes that UNHCR should insist that the German 
authorities strictly respect the 1951 Convention on the 
protection of refugees, the 1967 Protocol and other relevant 
international documents, and thus prevent yet another 
humanitarian catastrophe, the letter said. 
  Bonn's decision to expel Yugoslav citizens is clearly aimed 
to exert political pressure on Yugoslavia. It is simultaneous 
with the persecution and arrests of Serbs in Germany on charges 
of alleged war crimes in ex-Yugoslavia. 
  At the same time, Bosnian Serb military sources claim that 
Moslem refugees are being rounded up in Germany and dispatched 
to the Moslem Army in the civil war-torn ex-Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Belgrade, Mar 9 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav Government, 
with its new economic measures, has eliminated hyperinflation 
and saved the national currency, the dinar, but it has not 
significantly improved the standard of living of the population 
which continues to be critically low. 
  According to federal statistics, although the cost of living 
for a four-member family in February has dropped by one-quarter 
as compared to January, average salaries are on a subsistence 
level. 
  According to statistics, a four-member family needed 440 new 
dinars (or 440 German marks) for a normal diet in January and 
340 dinars in February. 
  Official data have not yet been published but estimates are 
that average salaries in February amounted to 50 dinars. This 
means that one needed almost seven salaries to ensure a quality 
diet. 
  Average salaries in the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia amounted 
to 35 dinars (or 35 German marks) including payments in kind 
recieved by employees of many companies. In comparison, the 
average salary at the end of 1990 amounted to 560 German marks. 
  Massive impoverishment of the population began in 1991 when 
the Yugoslav Federation disintegrated, rocking the foundations 
of the economies of all six former members. 
  The drop of the standard of living became dramatic in May, 
1992, when the U.N. Security Council imposed economic sanctions 
on the Yugoslav Republics of Serbia and Montenegro. 
  The new economic measures, enforced late January, prevented 
a 
total financial and economic collapse and are being implemented 
without foreign aid or loans.

<F P=106> [Interview with Franz Neubaer, spokesman of the Sudeten </F>
German Landsmanschaft, by Emilie Harantova; place and date not 
given: "Compensation Should Be Made Collectively, Neubauer Says"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Sudeten German Landsmanschaft 
appreciates that Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has not been silent 
about compensation to Sudeten Germans; nevertheless it rejects 
his concept. Landsmanschaft Spokesman Franz Neubauer said in an 
interview for MLADA FRONTA DNES that Sudeten Germans must insist 
on their idea of collective compensation. "It is not all right 
for Prime Minister Klaus to try to provide compensation only on 
an individual basis," Neubauer said. 
  "If we recognized the rights of individuals, the government 
would have to decide whether to provide compensation to 
Neubauer, for example. I do not believe that they would decide 
in my favor. This is why we want collective solutions." 
  [Harantova] Klaus's concept is completely unacceptable to 
you, then? 
  [Neubauer] We would be prepared to accept even this 
alternative if Klaus would waive, in his new concept, the 
condition for granting Czech citizenship being knowledge of the 
Czech language and five years of residence. Even this would 
always have to be connected with some administrative action on 
the Czech side, which would make the right to return more 
general. If this is not what Klaus meant, I do not understand 
why he spoke about his new concept. 
  [Harantova] Let us suppose that, despite the individual 
solutions, we found a certain way and some Sudeten Germans 
wanted to settle here as Czech citizens and claim their property 
rights. What would happen then? 
  [Neubauer] There are many fields without owners in your 
country. Some of them lie fallow and the rest are 
collectivized. My mother comes from a small village near Karlovy 
Vary. Certain houses have disappeared, and, in the rest, I saw 
some Gypsies. All of it belongs to a collective farm--that is, 
the state. 
  [Harantova] The fields should be returned to their original 
German owners? 
  [Neubauer] If they want them, yes. The remaining property, 
whose original owners were Germans, could be used to establish a 
fund. From this fund, compensation could be paid out to those 
people whose houses have been demolished or sold to Czech 
owners. Again, I am stressing, we do not want to expel anyone. 
This would not be the correct way to begin a new coexistence. 
It is impossible to reduce the entire problem only to property 
issues. First, we have to eliminate distrust and speak again. 
Why does your policy not have the courage to stand up to the 
communists? Why is it impossible to abolish the law of May 1946 
whereby crimes committed against Germans and Hungarians after 
the war were amnestied? In fact, this would have little 
impact--those are affairs of 50 years ago--but it would be a 
nice gesture of goodwill. 
  [Harantova] Do you consider the restitution of Jewish 
property to be a precedent? 
  [Neubauer] The problem of restitution shows that the 
inflexible conditions given by your restitution laws are 
unacceptable. This has become apparent in the problem of 
church, Jewish, and Sudeten German property. From the legal 
point of view, these three problems are equal. Is it possible 
to consider only injustices that occurred during communist rule? 
What about injustice before the communists? Is injustice done 
by communists worse than other injustices?

<F P=106> [Report by Kalina Stancheva on news conference on Prime </F>
Minister Berov's condition, at the Council of Ministers Press 
Center in Sofia -- live] 
  [Text] A news conference began several minutes ago, in 
which Colonel Dr. Milan Petrov, director of the Military Medical 
Academy, and Dr. Gerasimov of the Lozenets Government Hospital 
took part. The briefing provided exhaustive information on 
yesterday's events and the condition of their patient, Prime 
Minister Berov. 
  According to Col. Milan Petrov's statement and to our great 
joy, things are proceeding normally. Col. Petrov said that there 
has been an improvement in the patient's state of health as 
compared with yesterday, and the doctors hoped that his 
situation would continue to improve more quickly during the next 
few days. 
  Dr. Gerasimov was the first doctor who saw Professor Berov 
when he was admitted yesterday. After a medical consultation in 
which eminent cardiologists took part, the necessary 
investigations were carried out, and only then was a diagnosis 
made. Dr. Gerasimov agreed that the expression "cardiac crisis" 
that was used yesterday did not constitute a diagnosis, but 
merely described the state of the patient at the time of 
admission. The diagnosis that was announced a short time ago 
was a crisis of unstable stenocardia, whose effects the doctors 
have succeeded in bringing under control -- that is, a period of 
so-called cardiac ischemia. So far, the doctors declared, there 
is no sign that Prof. Berov has a developed infarct. The 
doctors said they had succeeded in controlling the stenocardia, 
but they made the proviso, which we understand, that every 
problem follows its own peculiar development. 
  In answer to a question as to how long their patient would 
undergo treatment, the doctors said he would be treated for 
15-30 days, depending on whether the heart attack caused any 
damage and how the patient's body reacts. 
  A further question tried unsuccessfully to commit the 
medical 
team to say whether, following his recovery, Prof. Berov would 
be able to return to active political life, Dr. Gerasimov 
somewhat jokingly said: I might be able to say if the case was 
one of a psychic illness, which is not the case. However, as 
far as a heart illness is concerned, following his recovery 
every individual can return to the active life he was following 
previously. How much of a load he can put on himself is another 
question. However, in recent history we have examples of 
presidents who have had bypass operations and had other cardiac 
complaints. 
  An explanation was given on another matter that had caused 
annoyance to the team of doctors and the Council of Ministers 
Press Center -- namely, the headline in a medical journal: 
Prime Minister Struck Down by Third Infarct. The medical team 
from the Government Hospital declared that, to date, Prof. Berov 
had suffered only one infarct, and that was in 1972. In the 
present case, the attack had not developed so far as to cause an 
infarct. 
  The briefing continues, and we hope to have more information 
later.

to the political forces to continue working on fulfilling the 
national budget and concluding deals with the creditor banks of 
the London Club and the IMF, instead of exploiting Prime 
Minister Berov's state of health to increase tension in the 
country. According to GOR leader Aleksandur Tomov, the 
situation at the moment should not be dramatized, especially 
because no one currently wants new elections. Tomov assesses 
the recent visit of the GOR delegation to Russia as useful and 
timely.

  [Text] Today Burgas Port started to step up its 
operations, after it had offered its services for handling goods 
shipped from and to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM]. The first shipment of export goods from 
Macedonia has arrived. 
  A Russian cargo ship is expected to arrive with 14,000 
metric 
tons of rice, which has to be transported to Macedonia by road. 
The trend is for mainly food products to be shipped to 
Macedonia, in return for exports of chemical industry products 
and raw materials. 
  According to a preliminary arrangement, a Macedonian 
delegation is expected to visit Burgas Port at the beginning of 
next week, with a view to signing a final agreement on handling 
goods shipped to and from Macedonia.

<F P=106> [Report by Bozhidar Spasov: "2d Army Dissociates Itself From </F>
Rakovski Legion Petition"] 
  [Text] Under the leadership of Major General Gancho Denev, 
a meeting was held at the Plovdiv Military Club of the officers 
and commanders of the 2d Army, the subordinated units and 
detachments, and commanders of the Air Force Corps. Deputy 
Defense Minister Vladimir Penchev, Defense Ministry 
parliamentary secretary Nencho Nenchev, and Lieutenant General 
Lyuben Pekhlivanov, deputy commander of the Bulgarian Army 
General Staff, were also present. 
  Two issues were discussed -- the declaration of the Rakovski 
Bulgarian Officer Legion and the petition organized by the 
legion's officers and members in connection with the defense 
budget, which has already been adopted. 
  Colonel Stefan Dervishev, commander of one of the units, 
said 
that no more than 10 officers in the Khaskovo Division are 
members of the officer legion. He urged the participants not to 
connect the opinion of the officers in the division and the 
garrison with the opinion of a few officers. 
  The commander of the 2d Army said: As a member of the 
Military Council of the Bulgarian Army General Staff, the Ground 
Troops Military Council, and commander of the 2d Army, I think 
it is high time to stop speculating about the Army, and 2d Army 
personnel support that position. The officers of our Army do 
not rebel. A difficult year lies ahead, and our main concern is 
combat training -- more specifically, how to conduct training 
with the means that we have been allocated. Deputy Defense 
Minister Penchev thinks that most of the officer legion members 
who signed the petition have done so with a pure heart and a 
desire to help. However, he dissociated himself from the form 
utilized by the legion members.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Plamen Enchev: "Officer Putsch?"] </F>
  [Text] Judging the recent statement by Minister Valentin 
Aleksandrov, one could say that the Rakovski Bulgarian Officer 
Legion has crossed all limits of democracy in the Army. The 
reason for the statement was the notorious petition signed by 
the officers of the Khaskovo Garrison, which demanded that the 
military budget be increased. People started to talk about a 
rebellion of the officers and even an army putsch. Some people 
even suspected that behind the petition, there was the long hand 
of General Lyutskanov, who was forced to retire. 
  Members of the legion claim that they have not violated the 
Constitution and described the minister's thesis as absurd. It 
is not easy to determine which side is correct. Visits by 
high-ranking officers to the headquarters of the three Bulgarian 
armies were intended to smooth over the scandal under the cover 
of seeking measures aimed at providing more means than those 
envisaged by the republican budget, which has already been 
adopted. 
  Precisely one year ago, the Rakovski Bulgarian Officer 
Legion 
warned the politicians and the mass media that they would not 
allow vagabonds to mock our national symbols. What prompted the 
warning was the fact that the government and the national flag 
were booed at the 3 March 1993 celebrations. No one in the 
leadership of the Defense Ministry or the Chief Prosecutor's 
Office thought that the warning violated the Constitution or the 
Armed Forces' regulations. 
  It appears that the situation has changed today. 
High-ranking officers panicked when they realized that their 
subordinate officers want precisely what they themselves want -- 
more money for the country's defense and security. Despite the 
fact that they wear uniforms and carry shoulder straps, the 
military are also citizens of our republic and enjoy the same 
rights as every other citizen. 
  On 1 March, the legion's initiative to convene a roundtable 
on the Army's problems was supported by the National Police 
Trade Union. Solidarity actions were promised. Policemen said 
that political neutrality and the one-man-command principle 
should not prevent the officers and sergeants from discussing 
the country's vitally important problems. One could hardly 
object to that argument. 
  It is excessive to fan tension around the officers' 
initiative. It will only escalate tension in other areas at a 
time when a consensus exists among society about defense and 
security. The high-ranking officers should have more confidence 
in the lower-ranking officers, because they all serve a common 
cause.

  [Excerpts] There was a slight hitch in the agenda in 
Brussels, Gyorgy Foris reports: 
  [Foris] It created a general surprise in Brussels that, at 
the last minute, the meeting of the European Union's troika and 
the six Eastern European countries that had already signed the 
association agreement--Hungary included--was cancelled or, 
rather, postponed. The reason for the delay is the non-stop 
negotiation with Norway on admission. [passage omitted] 
  The Czech foreign minister's answer to all this was to 
propose the cancellation of the meeting altogether and to fix a 
new date in a few weeks. The parties finally agreed to it and 
parted. In the meantime, the bargaining over Norway's membership 
is still under way. 
  Opinions regarding the evaluation of these events are, to 
say 
the least, divided. The official Hungarian position--according 
to Gyorgy Granasztoi, Hungarian ambassador in Brussels--is that 
we understand the difficulties faced by the European Union and 
the Greek presidium. After all, the European Union is currently 
experiencing crucial hours these days. 
  Anyway, according to Hungarian evaluations, we are very 
satisfied with the results achieved during the past two days, 
and the Hungarian delegation considers its trip to Brussels 
successful. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Istvan Kulcsar reports on the foreign affairs 
spokesman's regular press briefing today. 
  [Kulcsar] [Passage omitted] At the news conference Foreign 
Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman took several questions regarding 
the foreign ministers' meeting of the Central European 
Initiative in Trieste last weekend. He replied: 
  [Begin Herman recording] At the foreign ministers' 
consultation, it could be detected that certain countries were 
backing out from handling the national minority issue. A 
proposal had been made earlier -- and every country of the 
organization agreed with this proposal in the initial stages -- 
to work out a document about the protection of national minority 
rights. The original idea was to ratify the document at a 
special foreign ministerial conference to be convened in 
Hungary. The attitude of Slovakia and the Czech Republic is 
currently less favorable than that of the former Czechoslovakia 
had been. 
  Nevertheless, preparations of the document on the protection 
of national minority rights are continuing. The national 
coordinators will meet again in the near future, and we hope 
that this new consultation will produce progress in the 
formulation of the document. [end recording]

  [Text] The Hungarian parliament has passed the agent bill, 
which stipulates vetting the past of important officials. 
According to the law -- which was passed with 177 votes for, 12 
against, and 50 abstentions -- parliamentary deputies, 
government members, the heads of the National Bank of Hungary, 
and the mayor of Budapest will have to be vetted in future. The 
past of ambassadors, military and police heads, the top 
officials and editors of Hungarian Radio, Hungarian Television, 
MTI, and newspapers with a circulation of more than 30,000 will 
also have to be checked.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with SZDSZ Deputy Imre Mecs by </F>
unidentified announcer; date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] I welcome Imre Mecs, deputy of the 
SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], who is also a member of the 
parliament's National Security Committee. According to the new 
so-called Agents' Law [adopted on 8 March], the parliament's 
National Security Committee will have to select three judges 
whose duty will be to screen citizens. 
  Let us start with the most interesting aspect of the law: It 
is backdated to 1 January 1994 and will be in force untill 30 
June 2000. The relevant documents are closed to inspection 
until the year 2030. Well, this puts the whole affair in a 
different light. [passage omitted] 
  [Mecs] [Passage omitted] Back in the autumn of 1990, right 
at 
the beginning of the parliament's tenure, Gabor Demszky, then 
deputy, and Peter Hack, an excellent lawyer, submitted an 
excellent bill, which could have settled the matter. The 
government parties voted down the proposal, it was not even put 
up for debate in the parliament. 
  Then the government submitted several times a less well 
thought out and less clear bill that went on and on. Prime 
Minister Peter Boross participated in the debate of the bill in 
various capacities -- as a minister without portfolio 
supervising the secret services, and later as interior minister, 
and finally as prime minister -- and every time he voiced his 
doubts. 
  So, perhaps the kind of behavior that characterizes this 
matter is hypocrisy. On the one hand, they were pushing the 
propaganda for this bill, on the other, the government and the 
government parties did everything in their power to see that 
this law should not be adopted until the end of this 
parliament's tenure. 
  And here it is: The parliament adopted a law for the next 
parliament in the 11th hour, without sufficient preparation, and 
with the hastily thought out proposed amendments of the 
Constitutional Committee. And this is morally very 
objectionable behavior, and on behalf of my party I dissociate 
myself from it. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] However, you personally will have to search for 
the judges who will carry out the task of screening. [Passage 
omitted] What does not come to light from the Agents' Law is how 
far the investigation goes back into the past. For example, 
there are questions about whether or not someone was a member of 
the Arrow-Cross Party. So how far are we going back -- 40, 50 
years? [Mecs] [Passage omitted] It is rather a matter of 
principle. However, the law, in its opening paragraphs, lists 
the predecessor organizations it applies to and the PRO 
[Political Police Department -- Politikai Rendeszeti Osztaly] 
that was formed in February 1945, and thus its agent network and 
officer corps fall under the law. [passage omitted] 
  However, on the basis of various considerations, the 
government confined the terms of the law to the activities and 
employees of the III/3 Department [reference to the Interior 
Ministry's secret police group during the communist regime] and 
its predecessors. Thus, the informers who worked for the Army 
or the military police are exempt, and so are those who were 
planted in the emigration abroad and who caused immense damage. 
[passage omitted] 
  However, an even bigger problem is that, in effect, the 
implementation of the law will fail because, at the last minute, 
the National Assembly's Constitutional Committee smuggled into 
the law a provision that covers the editors and editor in chiefs 
of privately-owned papers with a circulation exceeding 30,000. 
This, we think, is unconstitutional on several counts. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] [Passage omitted] Do you think that the 
reporting 
of suspected former agents by members of the public will now 
become a fashion? [passage omitted] 
  [Mecs] It is very difficult to make reports like this 
because 
those in the know are former staff in the Interior Ministry, the 
officers of the III/3 Department, and a few leading former 
politicians. [passage omitted] However, there is no defense 
against slanderous accusations because the amendment that 
intended to create the possibility for any citizen to ask for a 
vetting against himself was rejected by the National Assembly. 
I fear that there will be many sly slanderous charges and 
people will not be able to clear themselves. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Are you sure that the documents of the reports 
survived? Some people doubt that the documents are authentic. 
We know that around the change of the regime there were 
cleansing and paper laundering at various departments. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Mecs] [Passage omitted] Indeed, very many papers were 
destroyed but even more survived. The staff of Istvan Horvath, 
did not select properly, but panicked and had all sorts of 
things destroyed. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Did you expect, when debating the law, that 
people would confess voluntarily? [passage omitted] 
  [Mecs] Look, this law is not, in effect, a penal law, it 
only 
exerts pressure on somebody to resign. He, who -- as a result 
of pressure regrettably became involved into the secret service 
and has since purified himself, having gone through a catharsis 
-- is a valuable person who is acceptable to society. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Istvan Csurka, cochairman of the Hungarian </F>
Justice and Life Party, by Pal Szombathy in the parliament on 8 
March: "The Agents Law Is Merely a `Powder Law'"] 
  [Text] I am glad I vetted myself earlier, and I voted 
in favor of this cosmetic law in order to prove that this thing 
no longer interests me -- Istvan Csurka told MAGYAR HIRLAP after 
the parliamentary vote of the so-called "agents law." Istvan 
Csurka, the cochairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party 
[MIEP], who uncovered his recruitment as an informer prior to 
his expulsion from the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], also 
complained that the parliament failed to extend the memorial day 
of Nazi victims to the victims of Bolshevism. 
  [Szombathy] What position did you and the MIEP group take at 
the vote on the agents law? 
  [Csurka] We voted yes, so we accepted the proposal. Our 
parliamentary group coordinated its stand prior to the vote and 
all of us tried to participate in the vote in order to emphasize 
our position. However, Janos Denes was so shocked at the 
previous vote (on the memorial day of the Nazi victims) that he 
was no longer able to wait for this vote too. I understand his 
indignation, because the entire legislative process is becoming 
ridiculous. 
  [Szombathy] Why did you decide to support the agents law? 
  [Csurka] Actually, this has never been questionable for us. 
We would have liked to adopt a serious law, but our strength is 
still to limited for that. The law is not an agent law, but an 
irresponsible "cosmetic law." The law on former informers will 
have no positive consequences on the Hungarian public 
whatsoever, because the law continues to leave the real agents 
unnamed and unpunished. 
  [Szombathy] If this is your opinion about the law, why did 
you support it? 
  [Csurka] It is better than nothing. We could not allow 
ourselves to be accused that precisely the MIEP was not voting 
in favor of the law, when we exclude every communist element 
from our activity. 
  [Szombathy] In your opinion, why is this law incapable of 
fulfilling its real function? 
  [Csurka] It does not have power, and it does not contain 
restrictions, punishments, and sanctions, like other laws. It 
makes the procedure extremely lax, and it does not cover the 
entire public life, and it is extremely lenient toward the old 
regime and party machinery. 
  [Szombathy] Why did you not try to make the bill stricter 
with various modification proposals? 
  [Csurka] We submitted modification proposals, but the 
miserable results of the vote preceding the agents law proves 
the extent to which such MIEP efforts were swept away. For 
example, we earlier demanded the replacement of the chief 
prosecutor. We are alone when we want to modify a law in order 
to condemn communism and the old regime. It is interesting 
that, yesterday too, there were 57 of us who wanted the memorial 
day of Nazi victims to be extended to the victims of Bolshevism. 
In our view, Nazism and Bolshevism are totally identical 
concepts. However, our parliament absolves Bolshevism and 
condemns Nazism. One victim should not be more sympathetic than 
the other one. In addition, I think the law on creating a 
memorial day is slightly dangerous because talks are now being 
held between certain Jewish organizations and the government on 
compensating the Jews and settling the damages incurred to them, 
and now the representatives of full compensation have received a 
big moral push with this law. Unfortunately, the parliament 
failed to sense that circumstance. This parliament is 
definitely ripe to step down. 
  [Szombathy] To what extent does your own case influence you 
when you voice your criticism? Certain things became known 
about this before your departure from the MDF.... 
  [Csurka] Those were difficult days, but I can only say that 
I am glad that I vetted myself and accepted the things that can 
be used against me. It is both an honest and Christian thing to 
remain alone on the pedestal, although I do not feel guilty at 
all. They cannot bring anything against me by which I caused 
any damage to anyone; I never submitted any report. 
  [Szombathy] Starting from your own case, what advice can you 
give to those affected by the law? 
  [Csurka] I do not deal with it, and I will not answer that 
question. I have nothing to do with them.

  The Romanian General Directorate for Passports within the

  Tonight, at 2100, our correspondent received information 
from 
the Romanian Embassy in Belgrade that the Romanian charge 
d'affaires, Constantin Garbea, was received today at the FRG 
Foreign Ministry upon his request, where he presented the 
official position of Romania in connection with the deportation 
of the Yugoslav refugees from Germany and their transit through 
Romania on their way to Yugoslavia. 
  It was noted that no understanding or accord between the 
Governments of Romania and Germany regarding the transit through 
Timisoara of Yugoslav citizens who will be deported from Germany 
has been reached and rumors that were circulating are groundless.

Reprisals Against Those Who Participated in Poll in the Republic

  [Text] On the occasion of the sociological poll "What 
People Advise," Dniester leader Smirnov's police closed the 
border crossing point at Gura Bacului, while in Dubasari the 
military control of Romanians who wished to go to the polls was 
intensified. The 14th Army took steps to find out who were the 
people who had voted in the parliamentary elections and the 
referendum,. The employees of the Ministry of Interior of the 
Republic of Moldova did not have the right to vote in the 
referendum, just as the they did not have the right to vote in 
the parliamentary elections either. As far as the results of the 
referendum are concerned, all the international observers 
announced that there was a much reduced presence at the polls in 
case of the referendum polls than in the parliamentary 
elections, and the government-backed television of the republic 
announced a presence of over 70 percent at the polls. Just as 
it has always been the case so far, the population was used to 
explain the prosoviet policy promoted by President Snegur.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergiu Andon: "Who Knocks Out Whom?"] </F>
  [Text] The suspense in connection with the government 
formula for the hot season has suddenly ceased. A few hours 
before boarding the plane that was to take him to the peninsula 
that is dominated in the north by a red dictator and the south 
by a strongarm capitalist regime, as well as to the lands of an 
uncertain but nevertheless much eulogized Chinese model, Mr. Ion 
Iliescu strengthened the bolts and screws of the state mechanism 
with one energetic key move. Prime Minister Vacaroiu tried in an 
expansive statement to convey the message that the reshuffle was 
according to his proposals. He could convince no one. The 
reshuffle is a move that obviously reflects the will of the 
president and the people who surround him, made exactly at a 
time when the voyage to faraway countries demanded that a 
tranquilizer be administered to the public that stays at home 
and to the others who were stimulated by the desire to govern. 
It was also a fortifier for the muscles of the central 
administration. 
  The fact that the reshuffle was carried out in haste is also 
seen from the given situation that, except for the defense 
minister, no rotations could be found for any of the former 
dignitaries. The improvisation from this viewpoint is very 
clear. In order to assuage Petre Ninosu's indignation, they 
quickly turned to a formula that is typical of the old regime -- 
namely, "he will be assigned to the Senate," as if appointing 
people to the Senate would still be decided in Office Number One 
and Office Number Two [reference to Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu]. 
  After so many negotiations, delays, and euphemisms, the 
hasty 
reshuffle suggests an action carried out under conditions of 
great irritation. One can speculate quite a bit about the 
reasons for this irritation. In any event, the public attacks 
to which many heads of the current political life were submitted 
was not the most upsetting thing, since the changes rather 
satisfy than discourage the slanderer nationalism. However, it 
would not be an exaggeration to assume that the journalistic 
performance, as well as the misdemeanor, to listen to the 
president's telephone and disclose the stenogram of the talks 
without any other obvious political reason but to simply make 
noise and show "who knocks out whom?" seem to somehow be 
connected with the only concrete and threatening declaration 
gathered from the new dignitaries -- namely, the statement made 
by the justice minister. In one of his states of strictness, 
which draws water to both the mill of sympathizers and the 
rivals, the president seems to have been insistent in his wish 
to demonstrate "who knocks out whom?" especially before the long 
journey. 
  The way in which the reshuffle was carried out -- compared 
to 
the previous declarations of the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of 
Romania] leaders, with the effort to pretend holding a dialogue 
with various political forces and the entire current driving 
force of the country -- makes us assume that the government 
changes have been carried out not only with a formal 
consultation of the prime minister but also over the heads of 
those who made calculations and competition within the ruling 
party. Not to accept this interpretation means to assume that 
the PDSR is a much too conspiring formula and much too 
hypocritical for an important party in a real democracy. 
  Still, there is a common element between the president and 
the party -- the continuously monocolor character of the 
government. In the light of the same relationship between the 
party and the president, one should also think of the very 
serious declaration made by [former Defense Minister] General 
Spiroiu upon leaving the cabinet: "I can tell you that the Army 
is under political control." 
  As a matter of fact, we are not just talking about the Army 
but all the levers of state authority. That can be seen by 
anyone who is looking at the list of portfolios that have been 
rotated. The official declaration of the president to the 
effect that the goal of the changes was to accelerate the reform 
process, curb inflation, and stabilize economic life in general 
sound either superficial or cynical. In this context, even the 
transportation department appears significant under a strategic 
rather than economic aspect. Thus, there is no doubt that the 
goal of this reshuffle -- the same goal that has been pursued 
for a long time now -- was to strengthen authority through a new 
act of authority. 
  Also in accordance with a more general style, certain 
appearances are also kept for those people abroad, especially 
when deciding on those changes that might acquire a European 
significance, when, in reality, all they do is satisfy internal 
political calculations. Here is just one example: the reference 
to the number of civilians who took the seat of generals is 
exaggerated when one thinks of the absence of any reference to 
the large file of incomplete legislation compared with the 
European legislation. And all this, when one of the four 
changes refers exactly to a "specialized" minister. 
  Smiling in a diplomatic way toward other countries, the 
political behavior of our president also seems connected with 
the hidden thought "who knocks out whom?"

  [Text] This afternoon, the leaders of the Democratic 
Convention of Romania [CDR] and those of the Democratic Party 
(National Salvation Front) [PD-FSN] discussed the political 
situation following the recent government reshuffle. 
  A declaration was signed that specifies that the 
parliamentary opposition parties believe that the reshuffle was 
carried out by ignoring the parliament; thus the situation has 
been reached that a third of the current government is made up 
of people who have not been confirmed by the parliament. 
  At the same time, the party leaders expressed their common 
attitude toward the replacement of Lieutenant General Niculae 
Spiroiu as head of the Ministry of National Defense within the 
context, quote, of intolerable extremist attacks against the 
military institution, something that creates great concern about 
the modernization and reform process, a measure that will exert 
a negative effect on the army and that will lead to the 
instability of basic institutions of the Romanian state, unquote. 
  The declaration expresses the parties' joint position in 
connection with the attacks -- which are viewed as immoral -- 
against former political detainees of the communist regime 
coming, quote, from some of the most docile servants of that 
regime, unquote. 
  In conclusion of the declaration, all the leaders of the 
opposition parties call on those responsible within the current 
government majority not to waste the chance for a rapid recovery 
of the material situation of our country's citizens. 
  Our reporter has also informed us that the PD(FSN) 
secretary, 
Mr. Cristian Radulescu, specified that tomorrow's planned 
meeting between the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] and 
the PD(FSN) has been postponed until next week. The date will 
be announced later. The reason for the postponement is the 
prolongation of the PDSR permanent delegation meeting that will 
be held tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu commentary: "A Reshuffle That Does Not Solve </F>
Anything"] 
  [Text] Yesterday morning, on the seventh day of the week, 
which was created by the Lord for all humans to rest, the news 
started circulating among political and press circles that at 
the Cotroceni [presidential headquarters] audio and video cables 
were being laid down to record the oath-taking ceremony of the 
newly appointed ministers. Many thought that is was just a 
joke. In order to have new ministers sworn in, first the old 
ones have to go. Until yesterday morning no one knew anything 
about any imminent government reshuffle. This is how yesterday 
at the Cotroceni they managed to set a new record of condensing 
into just a few minutes events that usually stretch over several 
days: The announcement of the government reshuffle, the 
announcing of the names of the new ministers, the oath-taking 
ceremony, and the sipping of the customary glass of champagne. 
Taking into consideration that all these historic moments took 
place at once, on Sunday at noon, when people are usually trying 
to cure their hangovers, we can safely say without fear of 
contradiction that this was a genuine original in the history of 
Romanian and even world politics. What made the PDSR [Social 
Democracy Party of Romania] leaders and Ion Iliescu adopt such a 
style of doing things -- that is, covering things in secrecy 
while gasping because of the sudden effort -- remains an enigma. 
In the next few days, when people will be less careful to keep 
their mouths shut, they will probably offer us the solution to 
this mystery. Until then all we can do is remark that such a 
style is far from being able to meet the requirements of 
democracy, which may be defined precisely by the long pondering 
that precedes decisionmaking, and that previously decisions were 
usually subject to debates or, at least, to the test of public 
opinion. Having secretly appointed Petre Salcudeanu as culture 
minister, the PDSR was subsequently surprised to find that the 
dignitary in question does not refrain from going to work with 
blurry eyes and with the zipper of his pants open [reference to 
photograph of minister in a compromising situation]. Let us 
hope that the PDSR will not be surprised in a similar way by any 
of the new ministers sworn in yesterday! 
  It is very difficult to work out a formula explaining the 
latest moves of the government party. It froze the negotiations 
with its left-wing allies to set up the red pentagon government 
[coalition consisting of PDSR, the National Romanian Unity Party 
-- PUNR, the Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania -- PDAR, the 
Socialist Party of Labor -- PSM, and the Greater Romania Party 
-- PRM], and opened negotiations with opposition parties. 
Despite the fact that PDSR issued a firm declaration engaging 
in a controversy with the left-wing political parties, the 
government party was very careful not to severe all the links 
connecting it with the PUNR, the PRM, and the PSM. This 
ambiguous stance made many of the country's nationalists wonder 
toward which end of the political scale the PDSR is actually 
leaning: the right or the left? Does yesterday's reshuffle 
answer that question? In my opinion, it does not. A closer 
look at yesterday's changes shows that the PDSR headed by 
Iliescu continues to play a double game. Some of the 
replacements were intended to satisfy the left wing, such as 
Niculae Spiroiu's ousting from the leadership of the defense 
ministry. Other replacements were designed to please the right 
wing, such as the ousting of George Ioan Danescu. One can 
assume that all these changes made the object of previous 
discreet consultations with the parties both on the left and the 
right of our political spectrum. However, considering that 
friendship does not count much in politics, one can safely 
assume that what the PDSR actually wanted to achieve by this 
government reshuffle is to continue to play the ball alone. 
After all, it cannot be excluded that the new ministers were 
appointed merely because they pass as reliable members of the 
government party and supporters of Ion Iliescu. They need 
reliable people if early elections are to be held, as in such 
electoral processes the key ministries are those of the interior 
and justice. 
  While in terms of the power struggle the reshuffle 
represents 
an important moment, in terms of the struggle to pull the 
country out of the current crisis it totally lacks significance. 
Trying to explain the replacements, the PDSR and Ion Iliescu 
claimed that they were necessary because more competence was 
required. However, it is quite clear that more competence was 
needed in areas other than those in which the reshuffle 
occurred. The latter, except for transportation, had been 
working quite well under the leadership of their former 
ministers. More competence would have been needed in the key 
ministries for the promotion of reform and privatization. But 
the reshuffle avoided precisely those sectors, while preferring 
those that are fundamental for the PDSR's survival. This gives 
us the right to assert that once more, the PDSR has placed party 
interests above the general interests of the country. The 
earth-shaking, epoch-making government reshuffle with which the 
PDSR has been threatening us over the past month does not solve 
anything.

<F P=106> [Report on lecture given by Petre Roman, president of the </F>
Democratic Party (National Salvation Front), at a conference 
held in Bucharest on 4 March on "Romania's Integration Into the 
Free World"] 
  [Text] Within the framework of the Romanian Athenaeum 
Conferences, the conference on "Romania's Integration in the 
Free World" was held at the Romanian Peasant Museum on Friday, 4 
March. Mr. Petre Roman, president of the Democratic Party 
(National Salvation Front) [PD-FSN] presented this lecture, 
while Messrs. Dan Amedeo Lazarescu, vice president of the 
National Liberal Party [PNL], and Andrei Plesu, acted as 
collocutors. 
  At the beginning of his lecture, Mr. Petre Roman referred to 
an inescapable fact: 
  "Reform is our country's road beyond communism. Certainly, 
all the former communist countries are experiencing a reform 
process. For us and in general, reform means seeking economic, 
social, and political normality, a normality of mentality, 
day-to-day normality, and, in the final instance, normality from 
a historical perspective. What is at stake is seeking not only 
our initial normality. We also have to ensure a synchronization 
with developments in the Western world and our entry into 
today's flow of world history. This self- discovery may be 
achieved not because it represents a recovery, but only because 
it represents the key to our access to modernity. In this 
century, Romania has run up a deficit of modernity caused by the 
fierce struggle with the numerous vicissitudes of history. This 
deficit exists and manifests itself in institutions with hardly 
any power, in a faulty and often confusing operation of 
democracy, in acute economic inefficiency, and in the 
insufficient competence of the most dynamic segments of 
practical activity. For those who love freedom, the way of 
post-communist transition cannot be anything other than openly 
moving toward the free world and then fusing with it (...) 
Romania's integration into the free world is not an ideal, but 
a tangible stage of our hopes. Our strength lies in the fact 
that we are able to say what we are; and we would be more 
powerful today if we clearly stated what we want to be (...) 
  "For us easterners, our mission is to reestablish and repair 
the thread that was broken on the eve of World War II and 
replaced, for almost 45 years, by communist integration with the 
internationalist Gulag. Our country's totalitarian past did not 
only mean lagging behind, but also being torn away from its 
times altogether. We are able to demonstrate that communist 
totalitarianism isolated us compared with the progress made in 
the free world. Because it was utopian, communism felt 
threatened by everything that was real and thus became obtuse 
and terrorizing." 
  Referring to Romania's economic situation between the two 
world wars, Mr. Roman specified the following: 
  "The statistics demonstrated that the main influence on the 
rhythm, proportions, and structures of the economy was exerted 
by the process of expanding the free market, a process that was, 
however, characterized by a hesitant liberalization practice." 
  He specified that "the statistics on our country's economic 
situation revealed disturbing facts: Both at the end of the 
inter- war period, and in 1989 -- after 45 years of communism -- 
Romania ranked 23d out of the 24 European states. In 1989, the 
country's GNP was 3.5 times lower than the European average. 
Also in 1989, for one GNP unit Romania used to consume 10 times 
more prime energy than Western European countries. During the 
25 years of Ceausescu's dictatorship, $230 billion was injected 
in our economy, which ranked 23d in Europe in terms of 
efficiency. Given the injection into the economy of such 
important sums of money, it would have been absolutely normal 
for economic efficiency, in general, to come close to the 
European average, something that was not even achieved in, let 
us say, the better periods of the dictatorial regime. (...) The 
communist regime, specifically the Ceausescu one, made Romania 
lose out on the great and truly revolutionary changes in Western 
society. I am talking of the technological revolution both in 
industry and agriculture of the 1960's, the revolution of 
inexpensive energy and the technological economizing on energy 
of the 1970's, and, finally, of the data processing revolution 
in the 1980's." 
  For Romania's integration into the free world, it is 
necessary, in Mr. Petre Roman's opinion, to take a number of 
measures: "Genuine national policies have to be put into motion, 
policies with precise aims, meaning primarily restructuring and 
privatization to ensure efficiency; conversion to eliminate 
waste; and adjustment and training to improve competence. We 
are no longer allowed to neglect, by any means in our political 
activity, such key words in the modern world as profitability, 
efficiency, efficient management, and productivity. It is clear 
that only economic freedom can ensure efficiency; exercising 
this freedom, however, should not generate unbearable effects 
for numerous people. (...) 
  "Thus we favor a competitive and equitable economic order. 
To overcome our historically accumulated economic and social 
deficit, Romania needs to adjust its economic credit, for a 
relatively short time, to the development model based on 
intercorrelated strategies. Namely: Obtaining resources for 
financing credits; giving an impetus to all kinds of investment; 
the development of markets to encourage profitable investment; 
and a selective and dynamic role of the state in managing and 
guiding the development process." 
  Summing up the ideas of his lecture, Mr. Petre Roman 
formulated the following objective: "Economic reconstruction and 
political democratization to ensure genuine national 
sovereignty." He stressed that without assistance on the part 
of the free world, Romania will not be able to integrate into 
Europe and recover.

<F P=106> [Interview with Victor Ciorbea, chairman of the CNSRL-Fratia </F>
Trade Union Confederation, by Constantin Mesenschi; place and 
date not given: "We Want Opposition Parties To Participate in 
the Government Also"] 
  [Text] [Mesenschi] Mr. Chairman, how do you view the 
results of the round of negotiations that have been held with 
the representatives of the government? 
  [Ciorbea] Unfortunately, we noticed that they showed a 
tendency to drag things out when it comes to finding solutions 
to the problems that we are currently facing. Most of the 14 
claims formulated by the CNSRL [National Confederation of 
Romania's Free Trade Unions]-Fratia were on a list that was 
submitted to the government as early as in May 1993 and those 
claims can be found again in the protocol concluded on 6 May 
1993 between the confederations that started the general strike 
and the government. Eleven claims were included among the 
requests expressed by our trade union confederation at the 18 
November rally. Immediately after the rally, during the round 
of negotiations held on 20 November, certain solutions were 
agreed upon and were to be adopted by the government within two 
weeks at the latest. This has not happened, so the problem is 
still topical, but meantime, another three claims have been 
added to the previous ones. 
  In conclusion, the discussions held recently with the 
government representatives have remained at a level of 
information exchanges and the government presented certain 
intentions and proposals that can be found in the draft activity 
program of that institution. Looking at things realistically, we 
believe that by not granting our claims, there was no way for 
the 28 February strike to be avoided. 
  [Mesenschi] What problems do you currently have to face and 
how do you believe they can be solved in time? 
  [Ciorbea] The 14 claims can be divided into two main groups. 
One refers to the acceleration of the reform process, that is, 
privatization, economic restructuring, ways to halt the 
subsidizing of those sectors that are working at a loss, and the 
need to introduce a new fiscal system, etc. The other refers to 
claims of a social nature, such as the need for the memorandum 
[with the IMF] to be accompanied by a program of social 
protection measures, particularly for the most disadvantaged 
groups of people, that is, the unemployed, the young, and 
pensioners. 
  Thus, our claims could be solved in a very short time, a 
minimum salary throughout the economy and a salary-price ratio 
could be established, and negotiations regarding the amount of 
money that will be allotted for the budget could start at once. 
But, first of all, it is necessary that the government and the 
Ministry of Finance show openness in connection with the draft 
budget, since both the provisions of Law 13/1991 regarding the 
collective labor contract as well as Article 15 of the 
collective labor contract at national level are currently being 
completely ignored. These laws stipulate that before the 
endorsement of the law on the budget, the representatives of 
trade union federations in all budgetary sectors and the 
representatives of the executive should hold negotiations on how 
much money will be allotted for the respective areas. We are at 
the end of February and those discussions have not even started 
yet, and we were not even given the document that contains the 
draft budget for 1994. 
  We have never had such a delay in negotiating the collective 
labor contract at the national level. The position adopted by 
the employers' association recently was extremely rigid, and 
even culminated with their representative being absent from the 
round of negotiations convened at the meeting with Dan Mircea 
Popescu. Thus, we can see that neither the employers' 
association nor the government are displaying any real desire to 
find solutions to the problems that we are currently facing. 
  Another group of claims refer to the need to have urgent 
programs endorsed immediately or to have them included in the 
norms, government decisions, or draft laws that have to be 
submitted to the parliament in urgent procedures. In this 
category I can mention some measures of social protection, such 
as establishing tripartite bodies, to ensure professional 
retraining, and modifying the package of laws that refers to the 
rights of trade unions and to labor legislation. But mainly 
they should refer to concrete measures to accelerate the reform 
process in the economic sector: privatization, restructuring, 
finding solutions to the economic-financial blockage problems, 
etc. 
  [Mesenschi] In that respect, how do you view the program of 
measures and actions drafted by the government to achieve the 
goals included in the government program for 1994? 
  [Ciorbea] Unfortunately, many provisions in this program 
can be found only a few years after the time we claimed them. 
The provisions regarding other claims are stipulated in 
extremely general terms, without any presentation of measures 
through which they could be implemented. Solutions to this 
program will almost totally depend on the implementation of the 
provisions included in the Memorandum concluded with the IMF. 
But, as is well known, there are real difficulties in this 
respect, because certain previous conditions have to be 
fulfilled and they have not been achieved to this very day. 
After the Memorandum is approved, there is still the question 
of the political will of the government to implement the 
provisions. Therefore, I must repeat our viewpoint that, in 
order to find solutions to those clauses stipulated in the 
memorandum, which are so very necessary to achieve 
macro-economic stability and mainly to obtain foreign financing, 
it is absolutely necessary to establish a new parliamentary 
majority. We believe this to be necessary because, in practical 
terms, we are currently witnessing an obstruction at the 
parliamentary level. That became even more obvious when the 
PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] and the PRM [Greater 
Romania Party] broke off relations, something that has become a 
reality. It is absolutely necessary to draft a new government 
program that basically should include concrete measures to 
enable the implementation of those provisions and the 
achievement of real social protection for the more disadvantaged 
social strata. Obviously, on the basis of this new 
parliamentary majority and of the program that I was talking 
about, a new government should be established. We would like to 
have a coalition government that should include the main 
opposition parties as well, because the social and economic 
crisis that we are currently facing can be solved only if we 
start solving the political crisis. 
  [Mesenschi] What have you done to achieve that goal? 
  [Ciorbea] We have recently been holding meetings at various 
levels. On the one hand, we have held discussions with the 
representatives of the government in an attempt to solve these 
claims and, on the other hand, we have held talks with our 
colleagues at the Alfa-Cartel, the leaders of the major 
opposition parties, and the PDSR leaders. During those 
discussions we wanted to find out what possibilities there are 
to establish a coalition government and a parliamentary 
majority, and to work out a new ruling program. 
  [Mesenschi] How are relations between the CNSRL-Fratia, 
Alfa- Cartel, and the BNS [National Trade Union Block] in terms 
of new trade union activities? 
  [Ciorbea] In accordance with the decision made during the 
latest meeting of the Executive Committee of our confederation, 
we are cooperating with the Alfa-Cartel with a view to carrying 
out certain joint activities. We noted with satisfaction the 
change of date of the general strike announced by the 
Alfa-Cartel, from 16 February to 28 February, as this has 
allowed the actions of our confederations to take place 
simultaneously. Similarly, we have agreed that if the general 
strike on 28 February does not have the expected effect, in 
March or April we will organize actions of greater scope such as 
rallies and a march in Bucharest and other towns. We might also 
organize a general strike by blocking roads, major arteries, etc. 
  For the time being, we are cooperating with the National 
Trade Union Block so as to finalize the collective labor 
contract for this year, a contract that the three confederations 
CNSRL-Fratia, Cartel- Alfa, and the BNS wish to sign on behalf 
of the trade unions. We would be pleased if the BNS 
participated in the organization of other joint activities in 
the coming period. 
  [Mesenschi] Mr. Ciorbea, please tell us what you think will 
be the consequences of the establishment of a government that 
would include the current parliamentary majority? 
  [Ciorbea] We hope that such a government will not be 
established, because this is one of the goals of the 28 February 
actions, to prevent such an act. The separation of the PDSR 
from the PRM represented a positive sign in this respect. We 
hope that a similar evolution will take place also regarding 
relations with other extremist, nationalist, and anti-Semitic 
parties. If, nevertheless, such a government were established, 
it is certain that the reactions, at least on the international 
plane, would be extremely unfavorable. There would even be a 
very big question mark next to the approval of the Memorandum if 
such a government were established. Similarly, the entire range 
of Romania's foreign relations and actions aimed at integration 
into European structures or NATO would be affected by such a 
decision. Obviously, international reaction would also have 
consequences for the domestic arena. 
  All these things also concern us, that is, trade unions, 
because such actions will be reflected directly in the evolution 
of the Romanian economy and the social and economic crisis in 
our country. 
  [Mesenschi] How will you hold a dialogue with such a 
government and how far will you go with your action in March or 
April? 
  [Ciorbea] In accordance with the decisions passed by the 
leading bodies of our confederation, we have not had, we do not 
have, and we will not have any relations with extremist, 
nationalist, or anti-Semitic parties. Thus, the problem of our 
relations with such a government would become an extremely 
serious problem, if we were to accept a dialogue or negotiations 
with an executive that includes such a formula. Obviously, our 
actions planned for March or April would be more aggressive if 
the executive opted for such a formula. I believe that our 
actions would reach extreme limits. 
  [Mesenschi] What do you mean by reaching extreme limits? 
  [Ciorbea] To stop the establishment of such a government. 
If, nevertheless, it were to be established, our actions would 
be directed toward dissolving such a government and replacing it 
with another one, based on a new parliamentary majority and a 
new program, which I mentioned before. 
  [Mesenschi] There has been much talk about the possible 
presence of the CNSRL-Fratia leaders at the helm of the Ministry 
of Labor and Social Protection. What should trade union members 
expect -- and not only they -- from a minister of labor who 
comes from their ranks? 
  [Ciorbea] No doubt such an act would also have positive 
aspects, but it would also involve certain risks, both for the 
respective organization as well as for the person in question. 
Among the advantages I could mention that the respective leader 
would take all the necessary measures to establish the legal 
basis for the tripartite leadership and social partnership, for 
a new labor legislation, and for new rights for employees in the 
industrial sectors and union members, which would be in 
accordance with generally accepted European and international 
standards. He would consider the trade union a serious partner 
in the social dialogue and would immediately proceed to the 
establishment of those triparty bodies, ensuring professional 
retraining, and establishing a socioeconomic council, etc. 
  Similarly, such a leader would be concerned with ensuring 
real and adequate social protection mainly for the most 
disadvantaged strata of the population in this period of 
transition, using all the available funds in that ministry to 
maximum effect: the unemployment fund, social security, and 
important sums that come from the PHARE [Economic Reconstruction 
Aid for Poland and Hungary] program or from loans obtained from 
the World Bank and the IMF. He would do all this to curb as 
quickly as possible the substantial, even twofold, increase in 
unemployment that is expected by the end of this year . 
  However, such a government would also take special risks 
because it is certain that currently or in the near future, of 
the ministries in our country, the Ministry of Labor will be the 
one most difficult to manage because it is necessary to ensure 
social protection while financial resources are limited as we 
know. 
  [Mesenschi] In your view, is it possible that a political 
pact, including a social pact as well, will be signed in the 
current political situation? 
  [Ciorbea] If, by political pact we understand an accord 
concluded with absolutely all the parliamentary parties, then my 
answer is negative. I do not believe that there are adequate 
conditions in this respect and, I repeat it, the break between 
the PDSR and the PRM emphasizes the impossibility, at least for 
the time being, of achieving such a pact. 
  On the other hand, it is very possible to conclude a 
government pact based on a new parliamentary majority that at 
the same time might include the necessary -- albeit not 
sufficient -- conditions to begin negotiations regarding the 
social pact that the country badly needs to overcome this period 
of crisis.

  [Text] The Cabinet of the Slovak Republic has held an 
extraordinary session to discuss the president's address at the 
National Council. The Cabinet adopted a statement expressing 
its great alarm and distress regarding the president's speech, 
which it considers to be an outrageous attack on the fundamental 
institutions of our young state that have been formed on the 
basis of democratic elections; the attack damages the name and 
status of the Slovak Republic abroad and significantly 
destabilizes the internal political situation, which is already 
rather complex. 
  The Cabinet on principle rejects the president's speech as 
confrontational and unprecedented, contradicting European 
political standards and human ethics and going beyond the 
constitutional powers of the president of the Republic, even 
more so because this Cabinet deserves credit for the formation 
of the independent and sovereign Slovak Republic and bears main 
responsibility for its development. 
  The Cabinet will submit the speech by the president of the 
Republic to a thorough analysis and will inform the citizens 
about its outcome.

  [Text] [Announcer] Shortly before 1800 hours, Deputy 
Ladislav Pittner [Christian Democratic Movement] submitted the 
following proposal in parliament: 
  [Begin Pittner recording] I am submitting a proposal for a 
vote of no confidence in Vladimir Meciar, the prime minister of 
the Slovak Republic. 
  Vladimir Meciar, as prime minister of the Slovak Republic, 
has led the Slovak Republic into a political and economic 
crisis. By his statements, attitudes, and decisions, he has 
diminished the credibility of the Slovak Republic abroad; by the 
methods of his political work, on a long-term basis, he was 
unable to win over sufficient support within the minority 
government and in the Slovak Republic National Council. He was 
incapable of maintaining acceptable relations with the other 
supreme bodies of the state, in particular with the Slovak 
Republic National Council and president. 
  It is for this reason that, in harmony with the Slovak 
Republic Constitution, I submit this proposal, together with the 
list of signatures of the necessary number of deputies, to the 
Slovak Republic National Council, asking for this proposal to be 
discussed. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] The parliament will vote on Ladislav Pittner's 
proposal in a short while.

  [Text] The cross-party standing committee of all Slovak 
parliamentary parties met today shortly before 1700. President 
Michal Kovac and Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar were also 
present. Peter Weiss, the parliament's deputy speaker, has 
informed us about the meeting's results: 
  [Begin Weiss recording] The cross-party standing committee 
has met on my initiative. I based it on the final part of the 
president's speech on the need to seek ways toward national and 
political conciliation, healing political wounds, easing the 
atmosphere of confrontation, and creating peaceful conditions 
for early elections. 
  On the basis of this initiative, a meeting was held in the 
presence of both the president and the prime minister. 
Representatives of all parliamentary parties and movements were 
there. Various proposals were presented there for the creation 
of a broad coalition government--also by the president and 
myself. 
  It must be said that the prime minister explicitly rejected 
the idea of a broad coalition government until early elections 
are held. The atmosphere that arose there was more likely to 
lead to a new confrontation than to a constructive dialogue. 
That is, the prime minister showed unwillingness to seek a 
solution that would be generally acceptable. [end recording]

  [Text] [Announcer] Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar took his 
place in parliament today during the discussion of Deputy 
Pittner's proposal to take a vote of no confidence in the Slovak 
Republic Government. 
  Pavol Kanis, from the Party of the Democratic Left, asked 
the 
prime minister to address parliament. 
  [Begin Meciar recording] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, 
esteemed Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to take the opportunity 
given to me by parliament to speak. This did not use to be the 
habit in these rooms in the past. 
  I have, however, been unable to acquaint myself with the 
speech by the president. I was receiving the World Jewish 
Congress's delegation during his address. There is no written 
record (?of his speech). The government members were acquainted 
with the speech. I was, unfortunately, present at the 
discussion (?here in the back of this hall), and, hence, I 
missed the government session. I do not even have the papers 
that the government has. 
  I would consider it an honor to speak about these matters 
tomorrow. But do not ask me to speak today. I am not familiar 
with the issue on which I am to express an opinion. [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] We are ready to broadcast the prime minister's 
speech in a live relay on ST2 tomorrow. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Slovak National Party [SNS] Chairman Jan Slota told 
a TASR correspondent that his party had suggested to the Party 
of the Democratic Left [SDL] chairman that it would withdraw 
from the coalition with the HZDS [Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia] if it was inevitable in order to form an HZDS-SDL 
coalition before early parliamentary elections. He said that 
the SNS was aware that the problem that has arisen was not a 
result of politicking but of the economic collapse of this young 
republic. 
  SDL Chairman Peter Weiss reacted to Slota's offer to 
withdraw 
from the coalition with the following words: We are willing to 
negotiate with anyone, but today, after the president's speech, 
the situation is different from what it was yesterday. 
  Asked whether the SDL was united, Weiss responded that four 
deputies had not signed the proposal to dismiss the prime 
minister because they insisted that the issue of early elections 
should be resolved first. He added that the current crisis in 
the country could not be resolved by passing a vote of no 
confidence in Vladimir Meciar without agreeing on a date for 
early elections.

  [Text] Imrich Mori, deputy chairman of the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia parliamentary group, has confirmed to the 
press agency [as heard] that he resigned from his post at 
yesterday's session of the parliamentary group. The reason for 
the decision is his fundamental disagreement with the 
formulation of the second question of the referendum, which 
concerns the withdrawal of deputies' mandate.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] After yesterday's talks in 
Bratislava with Slovak Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak, 
senators of the Kingdom of Belgium who are here at his 
invitation, visited southern Slovakia today. Peter Rohac has 
more to say about their agenda today. 
  [Rohac] [passage omitted] Although both senators are experts 
in defense and foreign policy, they also have great experience 
in the working of autonomy and coexistence between citizens of 
different ethnic backgrounds from their own country. [passage 
omitted] 
  On the other hand, Peter (Baby), a deputy for the municipal 
council, expressed the view that the local Hungarians, although 
Slovak Republic citizens, belonged to the Hungarian nation, 
which was artificially divided. 
  He alleged that the present Slovak state power was trying to 
assimilate the Hungarians rather than integrate them into a 
unified Slovak Republic. Our other state administration 
representatives reacted against this opposition standpoint. 
Senator Nestor Hubert Pecriaux, who is a member of the Council 
of Europe, remarked that they knew about the Hungarian political 
parties' complaints, but there was no need to dramatize the 
ethnic minority problem. On the basis of their experience here 
[in Slovakia], he thought that all who wanted to coexist could 
prove that this was possible. It is apparently clear that all of 
the European communities have a different approach to these 
questions, and it is logical that everybody has the right to 
organize himself according to how he feels, but, on one 
condition, and that is that all voters and citizens are 
satisfied. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Letter to the Editor by Vladimir Palko, Jozef Klein, Juraj </F>
Kohutiar, Pavol Katreniak, and Vladislav Chlipala: "Is There a 
KGB Threat?"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the editor received the text of a 
statement by top functionaries of the former Federal Security 
and Information Service (FBIS), in which they respond to the 
implications of a visit to Bratislava by the head of the Russian 
Foreign Secret Service. 
  ``Reports in the [Slovak] media covering the visit of J. 
Primakov, director of Russia's Foreign Secret Service, reveal 
that our intelligence service has `its man in the Russian 
service and, vice versa, the Russians have their man in SIS 
[Slovak Information Service].' Thus, four years after the day on 
which the CSFR Interior Minister, Jan Langos, legally suspended 
KGB activities on CSFR territory by canceling an agreement with 
the KGB, we are again witnessing the legalization of activity by 
members of the present Russian secret service on Slovak 
territory. 
  ``The Russian secret service is a direct successor to the 
First KGB Directorate and, from the personnel standpoint, is 
practically identical with it. Even if one takes into account 
the need for exchanging certain kinds of information between the 
Slovak information service and foreign information services--the 
Russian one included--we still consider that the presence of a 
representative of the Russian service in SIS amounts to a breach 
of the stated goals of the Slovak Republic's foreign policy. In 
view of the philosophy and practices of the Russian intelligence 
service, we feel that collaboration of the proposed sort 
disqualifies us from participation in wider cooperation with the 
special services of other democratic countries and, in 
conjunction with other factors, practically predetermines 
Slovakia's orientation toward the East. Neither can the 
proclaimed reason for this kind of close cooperation--fight 
against Russian and Chechen mafias--pass muster because these 
targets are not included in the Russian Federation law on 
foreign intelligence.'' 
  Signed: Vladimir Palko, former FBIS First Deputy Director; 
Jozef Klein, former Director, FBIS Office, Bratislava; Juraj 
Kohutiar, former Deputy Director, FBIS Office, Bratislava; Pavol 
Katreniak, former Director, FBIS Office, Banska Bystrica;

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "A False Claim, To Say the Least"] </F>
  [Text] Bratislava -- At its meeting in Zilina on Saturday 
[5 March], the Association of Slovak Soldiers (ASV) Presidium 
discussed the reasons cited by Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak 
when he expressed his disagreement with the signing of an 
agreement on cooperation between the ASV and the Defense 
Ministry. It considers his claim about the Association's almost 
illegal conduct to be, to say the least, false. This statement 
is contained in a letter handed to TA SR by ASV Chairman 
Lieutenant-Colonel Milan Stegena. 
  According to the letter, the ASV Presidium has weighed the 
reasons and circumstances associated with them for the planned 
nationwide commemoration of the 55th anniversary of the 
repulsion of Hungarian aggression in March 1939 and, after 
taking all of them into consideration, especially the 
organizational requirements, has decided to hold the event on 26 
March.

  [Text] This is Andjelko Perincic reporting from Zagreb 
airport for Croatian radio. Mate Granic, the deputy prime 
minister and minister of foreign affairs of the Republic of 
Croatia, returned to Zagreb at about 1000 this morning following 
his working visit to Russia. As reported yesterday, he had 
talks in Moscow with Andrey Kozyrev, the Russian minister of 
foreign affairs, and his deputy Vitaliy Churkin, who is also 
President Yeltsin's special envoy for former Yugoslavia. The 
main topic of the talks was the efforts to find solutions to the 
crisis in former Yugoslavia. 
  Speaking about the state of overall Croatian-Russian 
relations following the talks yesterday, Minister Granic said: 
  [Begin recording] As for our bilateral relations, these are 
developing well and it is likely that later this year my 
official visit to the Russian Federation will take place, and 
that the prime ministers will also exchange visits. There is 
also the possibility of a top-level visit by the end of the year. 
  Our talks in Moscow were dominated by two important issues: 
on the one hand Bosnia-Herzegovina and the efforts to involve 
the third side, i.e. the Bosnian Serbs in the negotiations; on 
the other, the completion of the current and the possibility of 
a new, more active mandate for UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] 
and the normalization of overall Croat-Serb relations. In our 
view the talks were useful, substantive, and open. The talks 
will continue. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, March 10 (TANJUG) -- President of the 
republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) Milan Martic proposed on 
Thursday to the U.S. President Bill Clinton to send a study 
delegation to ``ascertain the historical and contemporary causes 
of the war in the former Yugoslavia.'' 
  In his letter to Clinton, the copy of which was given to 
TANJUG, Martic says that ``the United States diplomatic body 
fails to gather information from the Serb side, and focuses its 
attention only on those given by Croatian, Moslem or Albanian 
sources.'' 
  Both the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade and American Ambassador in 
Zagreb Peter Galbraith act in this way, warns the president of 
the Republic of Serb Krajina, a republic proclaimed on the 
predominantly Serb-populated parts of Croatia in 1991, following 
Croatia's violent secession from the former Yugoslavia and the 
attempt to reduce the status of Serb people to that of an ethnic 
minority. 
  ``Mr. Galbraith has never mentioned in his public 
appearances 
any of ethnic cleansing operations the Serbs have been exposed 
to in Croatia since 1990-1991,'' Martic says, bearing in mind 
that about 300,000 Serbs were expelled from Croatia under 
different pressures. 
  ``Mr. Galbraith should know that Croatia killed about 
1,200,000 Serbs during the World War Two, half of them in the 
Jasenovac death camp. He lays blame on Serbs alone, which is as 
great a sin as to blame the Jews for being massively burned by 
Germans in Hitler's death camps,'' Martic says. 
  He reminds Clinton of an incident in May 1992, when the 
Bosnian Moslems planted explosive in central Sarajevo, 
committing a crime against their own citizens so that they could 
blame Serbs for it, and this was why the U.N. imposed sanctions 
on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which have had disastrous 
consequences so far. Serb babies die massively due to a lack of 
basic medicaments. For nearly two years Serbs have not been 
allowed either to import or export, while at the same time the 
war between Bosnian Croats and Moslems has been going on and no 
one has been punished for it, Martic says in his letter. 
  ``I believe, Mr. President, that you would agree with me, if 
you only had the true information, that it is disastrous to 
equal the states such as Croatia and Moslem Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
with the states of free and democratic West,'' Martic says in 
his letter to Clinton.

  [Text] Belgrade, 9 Mar (TANJUG) -- The foreign ministry of 
the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] today informed all diplomatic 
and consular missions in Belgrade about the major Croatian 
offensive in the area of the village of Kozjan near Korenica and 
Mali Alan on Mt. Velebit, near Gracac, ISKRA reports. 
  Following minor provocations on 4 March, the Croatian Army 
intensified its activities and is bringing in reinforcements 
with strong artillery backing, the information says. 
  The representatives of diplomatic and consular missions in 
Belgrade have been requested to inform their governments about 
these assaults by Croatia against the sovereignty of the RSK, 
and to raise the issue in international forums, in view of the 
fact that Croatia is violating all the cease-fire agreements 
signed with the RSK so far. 
  The Krajina Foreign Ministry warns that the latest attack 
against the RSK, if the Croatian offensive is not checked, could 
have dire consequences and could result in the escalation of the 
war in the region of former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] The Serb Democratic Forum, a nonparty organization 
for Croatian citizens of Serbian nationality, held a news 
conference in Zagreb today. A report by Nenad Kocmur: 
  [Kocmur] The Serb Democratic Forum holds that the UN 
presence 
in crisis areas in Croatia so far has produced some results, 
primarily in the halting of armed conflicts. According to Forum 
Chairman Milorad Pupovac, no important political changes have 
taken place in the field -- there have been no agreements on 
cease-fire and demilitarization. Therefore, they are proposing 
a number of concrete activities to be taken: 
  [Begin Pupovac recording] First, the presidency of the Serb 
Democratic Forum believes that the UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] mandate needs to be extended as long as possible in 
order to avoid the renewal of clashes by disputes on its 
extension which would create a stable time framework for the 
resolution of civilian and political issues. 
  Second, agreements governing a cease-fire and 
demilitarization should be reached as soon as possible. They 
should provide adequate control of pink zones, of separation 
lines, and the international political observation and control 
of possible irresponsible actions. 
  Third, full opening of all communications must be secured, 
both physical and commercial communications, which should be 
under the UNPROFOR mandate, on which the sides should be 
consulted, but are not expected to give their consent. [end 
recording] 
  [Kocmur] The mobilization of Serb citizens into the Croatian 
Army was also mentioned at the conference. Petar Lazovic, 
chairman of the political committee of the Serb Democratic 
Forum, stated that some mobilization drafts are unacceptable, 
because citizens who do not have Croatian citizenship or persons 
either under 18 or over 50 years of age have been receiving 
draft notices. In that regard a letter has been sent to top 
representatives of Croatian Government departments.

  [Text] Knin, 9 Mar (TANJUG) -- There has been no letup in 
attacks by the Croatian Army in the region of Kozjan, east of 
Korenica, for four days, ISKRA [Croatian Serb news agency] has 
reported. Fierce fighting took place yesterday and the 
aggressor used mortars, multiple rocket launchers, and infantry 
weapons, ISKRA says, quoting the information office of the Serb 
army of Krajina general staff. Serb defenders have been 
returning the attacks and are successfully holding the defense 
lines, the statement says. 
  There was no peace in northern Dalmatia yesterday either. 
The Croatian Army opened fire from infantry weapons throughout 
the Drnis area, on the free territory of Kasic, and on villages 
in the Novigrad hinterland, and in the direction of Benkovac. 
There were no casualties in the attacks and the Serb defenders 
responded to all enemy attacks, ISKRA says.

  [Text] Our colleague Tihomir Ladisic talked with 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic 
through a satellite link this afternoon. Here are excerpts from 
the conversation: 
  [Begin recording] [Ladisic] What has been promised to you, 
President Izetbegovic, what do you expect from this federation 
in Bosnia and the confederation with Croatia? 
  [Izetbegovic] I must say that this agreement is a result of 
our interests -- they did not have to bribe us or pay us to 
conclude it. However, they told us, the most authoritative 
instances -- they told both us and Croatian officials, I believe 
they told President Tudjman -- that Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
Croatia will have an open door to all forms of European 
integration. Step by step, of course, but this door will remain 
open and we will receive lavish support for the reconstruction 
of the war-ravaged parts of the country. We will receive 
financial aid. They were unequivocal in this. Of course, we 
Bosnians were told that Western forces would come and help out 
in the implementation of what has been agreed. 
  [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, would you agree to a single 
Bosnia-Herzegovina if the Serbs consented to remain in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina but made this conditional on the creation of 
a confederation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia? 
  [Izetbegovic] I believe I can give a brief reply to that: 
out of the question. 
  [Ladisic] Does that mean that the creation of a new 
Yugoslavia under pressure from the world powers would also be 
out of the question? 
  [Izetbegovic] I think there is too much speculation 
surrounding the world powers' ideas on the creation of a new 
Yugoslavia. As far as I could deduce from my contacts, such an 
idea is not being entertained by serious, responsible people in 
the West. I am not saying that certain individuals are not in 
favor of such a thing, but I believe that such an idea is not 
being voiced as a realistic possibility -- I have not heard 
anything to this effect so far, in any form. There has been 
talk about certain forms of cooperation between the states 
created on the ruins of the old Yugoslavia -- economic 
cooperation -- but nobody had even hinted at the creation of 
some state entity. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with President of the Presidency of the Republic </F>
of Bosnia-Herzegovina Alija Izetbegovic by an unidentified 
correspondent for Croatian Television on 9 March; place not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, gave an interview to Croatian 
Television today in which he spoke about the Washington 
documents, the creation of a federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
and the confederation with Croatia. 
  [Correspondent] There have not been any, or rather, there 
have been very few reactions from Sarajevo to the Washington 
preliminary agreement. How would you personally comment on 
this, as it is of great interest to us? 
  [Izetbegovic] I believe that this was a good agreement. 
Naturally, I was in contact with Dr. Silajdzic throughout the 
entire duration of the negotiations in Washington -- I talked to 
him two or three times a day. Therefore, the general agreement 
that was created there was created with my full approval. So, 
if you ask me for my comment, it is positive. 
  [Correspondent] It is often being said that the agreement 
reached in Washington was extorted from you and President 
Tudjman. Was the agreement truly reached out of political 
interests or is this agreement a result of pressures and threats 
from U.S. policy and the Islamic countries? 
  [Izetbegovic] In any case, this concerns our interests, 
naturally, and I would not say that it was extorted. I would 
like to remind you that I put forward almost an identical 
proposal sometime last year; I believe that your press noted it. 
On that occasion I proposed a joint state for the Muslims and 
the Croats, stretching from the Sava River to the sea, without 
borders, and perhaps with cantons. This agreement was not 
extorted as regards myself and we saw our interest in it, of 
course. 
  [Correspondent] We are facing the signing of an historic 
agreement, as we perceive it here in Croatia, namely on the 
federation of Croats and Bosniaks in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and on 
the confederation of such a Bosnia-Herzegovina with the Republic 
of Croatia. Is this a just end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Izetbegovic] I would be very happy if this were the end of 
the war. It might be that it is the end of the war and I 
believe that this is the end of the war -- I want to believe so 
-- on those territories inhabited by Muslims and Croats. 
However the end of the war now depends on the Serbian side. 
You have used the expression, the attribute, federal. Well, I 
would say that this will be a just end to the war. However, as 
I have said, the end of the war on Bosnia-Herzegovina territory 
now depends on the Serbian side. 
  [Correspondent] Before we touch upon the problem of the 
relations [word indistinct] in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I would like 
to ask the following: Central Bosnia, Mostar, and the access to 
the sea were the main problems. Are these issues resolved by 
the preliminary agreement or [words indistinct] the problems 
that could endanger the entire agreement? 
  [Izetbegovic] They have not been entirely resolved yet. To 
my knowledge, their resolution is imminent, and perhaps this is 
being discussed there [in Vienna] today. However, I do not 
believe that they could threaten the agreement. You have 
mentioned three problems -- Mostar, Central Bosnia, and the sea. 
  I think that Mostar has been temporarily resolved with the 
concept of the European Union [EU] administration, and 
therefore, by the EU administering the town temporarily. I 
believe that this solution is good even though it is, of course, 
not a final solution. 
  The issue of access to the sea has been resolved, too, I 
believe, with the concept of confederation, by which the 
federation would have access to the sea in Neum and would have 
the use of the port of Ploce. Reciprocal arrangements have been 
made here that envisage the free movement of goods and people 
from Croatia via the territory of the federation, and naturally, 
the free movement of goods and people from the federation toward 
Ploce. This situation would be as though there were no borders. 
I believe that this issue is resolved. 
  The very delicate issue of central Bosnia, however, remains. 
As I understand it, there are some ideas that this issue be 
resolved by establishing sub-cantons within the central Bosnian 
canton. In any case, I believe that this is the most sensitive 
question left. I think that it will be discussed today and 
tomorrow and [words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] What seems the biggest problem to you and 
what makes you the most optimistic? 
  [Izetbegovic] I can say that with this agreement with the 
Croats here in Bosnia-Herzegovina and with the agreement between 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia as states -- naturally they have 
not been signed yet [words indistinct] but we are on the best 
way to sign them -- we have definitely made a giant step toward 
peace. However, an (?open) issue of the behavior of the Serbs 
remains. I can not forecast their behavior no matter how hard I 
try, and therefore, I could not answer whether peace is a matter 
of a month or two. However, I have a sort of premonition that 
[passage indistinct].

<F P=106> [Interview via satellite with Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency </F>
President Alija Izetbegovic by correspondent Tihomir Ladisic -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Ladisic] A new turnabout in the international 
political arena. The future of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a 
Croat-Bosniak federation, a possible confederation between 
Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina -- these are the topics of our 
conversation with President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency 
Alija Izetbegovic. Mr. Izetbegovic, good evening. 
  [Izetbegovic] Good evening to you. 
  [Ladisic] There have been no, or at least there have been 
very few reactions from Sarajevo to the Washington preliminary 
agreement. How would you personally comment on it? 
  [Izetbegovic] I think that this was a good agreement. Of 
course, I was in touch with Haris Silajdzic while the 
negotiations were in progress in Washington. I spoke with him 
two or three times a day. The preliminary agreement that was 
reached there was reached with my full agreement. If you ask me 
about my comment, it is positive. 
  [Ladisic] Did you speak with the people in Sarajevo, with 
your closest associates, with commanders of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army? What are their comments on the 
preliminary Washington agreement? 
  [Izetbegovic] I followed the press, I heard some statements. 
I can say that the news on the agreement was met with support, 
globally speaking. Of course, there are skeptics, while some 
witty people have labelled it as a marriage of convenience, not 
a marriage of love. But I wonder now whether there are some 
political marriages that are not of convenience, and people say 
that marriages of convenience are sometimes more stable. People 
believe that both sides have done well out of this and I share 
that opinion. 
  [Ladisic] It has been said quite frequently that the 
Washington agreement was extorted from you and President 
Tudjman. Was the agreement really signed out of political 
interests, or is it an agreement signed due to the pressure and 
threats coming from the U.S. Government or some Islamic 
countries? 
  [Izetbegovic] Of course, our interests are at work here. But 
I could not say that it was extorted. I would like to remind 
you that I put forward a similar, identical proposal last 
summer. I think that it was mentioned in your press. My 
proposal then was a joint Muslim-Croat state between the Sava 
and the sea, without any borders, perhaps with cantons. 
Therefore, this agreement was not extorted as far as I am 
concerned. Of course, we saw our interests in that. 
  [Ladisic] What remains now is to sign this historic 
agreement, as we see it here in Croatia, namely on the 
Croat-Bosniak federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and a 
confederation of that Bosnia-Herzegovina with the Republic of 
Croatia. Does this represent a just end to the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Izetbegovic] I would be very happy if this were the end of 
the war. Maybe it is the end of the war. I hope it is the end 
of the war. I want to believe that this is the end of the war 
in Muslim and Croat-populated areas. But the end to the war now 
depends on the Serb side. You used an attribute -- a just end 
-- I would say that this is a just end to the war. However, as 
I said, the end of the war on the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina now depends on the Serb side. 
  [Ladisic] Before we reach this issue concerning relations 
with the Serb side in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I would like to ask 
you: Central Bosnia, Mostar, access to the sea, these were the 
central issues; have these issues been resolved by the 
preliminary agreement or do you still deem them as issues that 
could jeopardize the entire accord? 
  [Izetbegovic] This has not been completely resolved. To our 
knowledge, the resolution of these problems is forthcoming, they 
might be discussing this today, but I do not believe this could 
bring the agreement into question. You mentioned three problems 
-- Mostar, central Bosnia, the sea. I think Mostar has been 
temporarily resolved with the European Union's [EU] 
administration, therefore, the EU would be in temporary control 
of the city, I believe that this solution is good although it is 
certainly not a final solution. 
  The issue of access to the sea -- I believe this has been 
solved through the concept of the federation by which the 
federation has an outlet to the sea via Neum and has the right 
to use the port at Ploce. Reciprocal arrangements have been 
made in this case that envisage free flow of goods and people 
from Croatia through the territory of the federation and, of 
course, the free flow of goods and people from the federation to 
Ploce. This would resemble a situation where there are no 
borders. 
  So, I think this issue has been resolved, but what remains 
is 
the extremely delicate issue of central Bosnia. As far as I can 
gather, there are some ideas according to which this should be 
resolved within the central Bosnian canton, some subcantons, in 
any case, I believe that this remains the most delicate issue 
and this will be discussed today and tomorrow, so I think we 
will know more tomorrow evening. That is what I expect. 
  [Ladisic] Speaking of central Bosnia, please tell us 
something about what you believe to be the core issue in central 
Bosnia -- is the issue in question demarcation? 
  [Izetbegovic] You know, there is a complete ethnic balance 
here. Moreover, the population is mixed to the point of being 
topsy-turvy. Subsequently, some towns with a predominantly 
Muslim population have come closer to Herzegovina and, in 
contrast, areas with a predominantly Croat population like 
Busovaca and Novi Travnik have become closer to the Zenica 
region, therefore there has been a jumble. This could have been 
the motive for the conflict between us and the Croats, but the 
main reason why I proposed a joint state this summer was because 
I felt we would be fighting over central Bosnia -- fighting 
hopelessly and without any results. I wanted to avoid this 
conflict. Of course, this problem has resurfaced in a new 
constellation of circumstances, in a new atmosphere, so I expect 
us to find some kind of solution. As I said, solutions have 
been proposed in the form of sub-cantons. This might be a 
solution, but let us wait a day or two -- our negotiators are 
twisting their brains over this issue in Vienna right now. 
  [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, you have said that the 
crisis was most difficult in central Bosnia and Mostar where 
most of the combat took place. Are you optimistic, bearing in 
mind that the cease-fire has been in place in those areas for 
more than a week? 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, I am optimistic. Two days ago I was still 
a bit wary and then I saw a TV report showing the withdrawal of 
heavy weapons. You probably saw that report too. It was then 
that I was certain that both sides were serious in their 
intentions. Of course, we mostly worried about the Croat side. 
At that moment I understood that the Croat side too wanted the 
agreement to be implemented and that is why I am optimistic. 
  [Ladisic] How would you assess the cooperation between the 
two army commanders? It seems that General Rasim Delic and 
General Ante Roso played a key role in connection with this 
cease-fire agreement. 
  [Izetbegovic] I think that we were fortunate to have two 
reasonable men in this role. I believe that they respect each 
other as men and as soldiers, and I believe that they had no 
hidden agenda. I believe we have been fortunate that the two of 
them discussed the delicate military problem. Many unresolved 
issues remain in this field. You know that we still have to 
resolve the issue of a future joint army, joint commands; how to 
unify units which have been fighting each other until recently. 
I believe that Generals Delic and Roso will be able to resolve 
this problem with our full support of course. 
  [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, after a long time we have 
an 
opportunity to discuss the reasons for the clashes, particularly 
in central Bosnia and in Mostar. The leader of the Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mate Boban, resigned and many in the world 
saw this as a major Croat concession in their negotiations with 
the Muslims. 
  [Izetbegovic] I believe that Boban's resignation was 
necessary in this case. I have to be blunt when I tell you that 
our public is justified when it considers him to be an author 
and initiator of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On the 
other hand you said that he was the leader of Bosnian Croats. 
Many of our Bosnian Croats do not think that he was the leader 
of Bosnian Croats; maybe he was the leader of one-third of 
Bosnian Croats. When I take into account the sentiments of 
Croats in central Bosnia, northern Bosnia, Posavina, or Tuzla, I 
could not say that he has any support and that he could win any 
kind of elections. Anyway, he was not elected leader of Bosnian 
Croats, he did not pass the test of elections. 
  [Ladisic] But, President Izetbegovic, do you see a problem 
in 
statements such as: There are no Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
which was said by Arif Pasalic; or, We should have reached an 
agreement with the Serbs, which was said by Ejup Ganic; or, The 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army must have a naval base in Neum, which 
was said by Semso Tankovic, chairman of the Party of Democratic 
Action for Croatia. These statements triggered off very 
tempestuous reactions in Croatia and, I believe, among the 
Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Izetbegovic] First of all, a distinction ought to be made 
between statements and deeds. When I spoke earlier about Mate 
Boban, I spoke about his deeds, about his actions, not his 
statements. There have been very many statements which I may 
have not liked, but they did not inflict any direct damage on 
anyone. As regards statements that you have just mentioned, I 
am completely sure about one thing: Ganic never said that we 
needed an alliance with the Serbs. You have to check on that. 
Please look for it somewhere. I have never heard such a 
statement, although I know very well what Ganic says, as we are 
very close associates. I know what he thinks, and therefore I 
know what he might say. The other two statements are probably 
authentic. However, we forbade our soldiers, not only because 
of Pasalic's statement, but also because of others, to make 
political statements. They are not going to do that any more. 
As far as Semso Tankovic's statement is concerned, he is a 
citizen of Croatia, it is true that he is a Bosnian by birth, a 
very good friend and associate of mine, but I do not think that 
his statement that we need to have some kind of naval base in 
Neum is a dangerous one. That would be a navy of the future 
federation. This should be perceived in that way. 
  [Ladisic] I believe that this occasion gives us an 
opportunity to openly show many cards. As regards Mr. Ganic's 
statement, it was taken from the foreign press. But, generally 
speaking, do you think that the time for normalization has come 
and that we should turn toward the future and that we should try 
to build this trust together? 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, if somebody asked what I ought to tell 
both ours and the Croatian public, even though you did not 
explicitly ask me to do that, but this is how I understand your 
question, then I would say that we should all look toward the 
future, rather than look back into the past. The past is 
teeming with bad things, particularly dating from recent times, 
while the future offers a ray of light. I think that we should 
turn toward the future, and look with optimism toward our future. 
  [Ladisic] If the agreement is signed, Croatia expects 
support 
for the reintegration of its occupied areas and political, 
security, and economic aid from the West. What has been 
promised to you, President Izetbegovic, what do you expect from 
this federation in Bosnia and the confederation with Croatia? 
  [Izetbegovic] I must tell you that this agreement is a 
result 
of our interests -- they did not have to bribe us or pay us to 
conclude it. However, they told us, the most authoritative 
instances -- they told both us and Croatian officials, I believe 
they told President Tudjman -- that Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
Croatia will have an open door to all forms of European 
integration. Step by step, of course, but this door will remain 
open and we will receive lavish support for the reconstruction 
of the war-ravaged parts of the country. We will receive 
financial aid. They were unequivocal in this. Of course, we 
Bosnians were told that Western forces would come and help out 
in the implementation of what has been agreed. 
  [Ladisic] Croatian President Tudjman said the Croat-Bosnian 
[Muslim] agreement was not a military alliance aimed against the 
Serbs. Do you see a solution and an end to the war without the 
military defeat of the Serb army in Bosnia-Herzegovina and a 
return of the occupied territories to Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Izetbegovic] I could join President Tudjman in his 
assessment that this is not aimed against the Serbs. This 
statement is well- grounded and appropriate. And speaking of 
this -- the military defeat of the Serbs and the recovery of our 
territories -- the military defeat of the Serbs is desireable 
but not essential for the establishment of peace. However, the 
return of occupied territories is both desirable and essential. 
This is a condition we will not give up. 
  [Ladisic] Has the world guaranteed in any way that these 
Serb-occupied territories could be recovered? 
  [Izetbegovic] There have been no direct guarantees. You 
know, however, that the draft federation agreement prescribes in 
one of its first articles that the federation is to be created 
on territories populated by a predominantly Croat and Muslim 
population. This was done in the presence of the Americans, 
with the knowledge of the west Europeans -- everybody welcomed 
this agreement in principle -- that is to say, that this 
envisages the return of all territories, Muslim and Croat. 
Therefore, this is not explicit, but it is implicit. 
  [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, the federation agreement 
has 
also been offered to the Serb side these days, what do you 
expect from this offer -- will the Serbs accept it, if not, if 
partition takes place and Bosnia-Herzegovina is divided, how 
could things be divided and what could the Serbs keep for 
themselves? 
  [Izetbegovic] The agreement -- we have done this on numerous 
occasions and I believe the Croats have done so as well -- the 
agreement is also open to the Serbs. Silajdzic is in Russia 
today and I think he is discussing this problem. Redman was in 
Belgrade yesterday and I believe his talks with Milosevic 
centered on this -- I cannot say for sure, I will be seeing him 
today, he is expected in Sarajevo today. In any case, we are 
not contemplating that the Serbs could snatch away part of 
Bosnia and attach it to Serbia. We are not even dreaming of 
reviewing such an idea. We are in favor of a single 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, would you agree to a single 
Bosnia-Herzegovina if the Serbs consented to remaining in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina but made this conditional on the creation of 
a confederation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia? 
  [Izetbegovic] I believe I can give a brief reply to that: 
Out of the question. 
  [Ladisic] Does that mean that the creation of a new 
Yugoslavia under pressure from the world powers would also be 
out of the question? 
  [Izetbegovic] I think there is too much speculation 
surrounding the world powers' ideas on the creation of a new 
Yugoslavia. As far as I could deduce from my contacts, such an 
idea is not being entertained by serious, responsible people in 
the west. I am not saying that certain individuals are not in 
favor of such a thing, but I believe that such an idea is not 
being voiced as a realistic possibility -- I have not heard 
anything to this effect so far, in any form. There has been 
talk about certain forms of cooperation between the states 
created on the ruins of the old Yugoslavia -- economic 
cooperation -- but nobody had even hinted at the creation of 
some state entity. 
  [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, one of my last questions. 
Please, if I failed to ask you something, feel free to say. How 
do you see the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina? Are we any closer 
to the final peace? What do you consider to be the biggest 
problem, and what do you look at with most optimism? 
  [Izetbegovic] I can say with certainty that with this 
agreement with the Croats here in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and with 
the agreement between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia as states 
-- these agreements have not yet been signed, ratified -- we are 
on the right path to achieve it, we have definitely made a giant 
step toward peace. However, the behavior of the Serb side 
remains an open issue. I cannot forecast their behavior no 
matter how hard I try, and therefore I could not answer whether 
peace is a matter of a month or two. However, I have a sort of 
premonition that by the end of late autumn peace will return to 
these areas. This is more of premonition than a rational 
assessment. 
  [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, thank you for participating 
in our Croatian TV program.

  [Text] The Presidency of the Social Democratic Party of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina supports the preliminary agreement on 
establishing a federation in the regions of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
with a majority Bosniak and Croatian population as a significant 
step toward reaching a complete solution to the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina issue. 
  This presupposes creating the possibility and finding a way 
to include the Serbian [words indistinct] generally solving the 
problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Thus the agreement is very 
valuable in terms of the cessation of combat activities and the 
establishment of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which are 
necessary conditions for making political decisions that would 
ensure lasting peace in the region. 
  We want to point out in particular that we expect on the 
basis of the text of the agreement, along with the devising of 
more efficient mechanisms and instruments, the full protection 
of human rights, the return of the refugees, and the 
establishment of a state based on the rule of law. 
  The agreement requires the active and honest engagement of 
all political factors and the creation of a political consensus 
to find the best constitutional solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  At the same time, the outline of the preliminary agreement 
on 
establishing a confederation between the Republic of Croatia and 
the Federation is a significant step and a serious basis for a 
principled normalization of relations with the neighboring 
republics, which will at the same time make it possible for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to integrate itself more easily into European 
cultural, economic, and political currents. 
  Therefore, we demand of the Presidency of the Republic of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina and the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina the 
broadest political consultations and the opportunities for full 
participation in creating constitutional solutions, reads the 
public statement by the Social Democratic Party of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Jagodina, 9 Mar (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, the 
president of the Assembly of the Srpska republic, said today 
that by first offering a draft solution on the basis of the 
Owen-Stoltenberg plan and then failing to meet its obligations 
from the draft, the European Union had wasted its chances of 
playing a more active role in the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. 
  The Serbs were asked to agree on 33.3 percent of the 
territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina for the Muslims; to allow 
the replacement of the Canadian battalion in Srebrenica; to 
withdraw heavy weapons from around Sarajevo; and to allow the 
opening of Tuzla airport, while in return the EU would do its 
utmost to ensure that the sanctions imposed on the Serb people 
were lifted as a matter of urgency, Krajisnik told Jagodina 
Radio today. 
  We have met all our commitments but the EU has done nothing 
to lift the sanctions. The EU alone is to be blamed for losing 
our trust and its reputation, and from now on any EU proposal 
will be met with a large amount of reservation, Krajisnik said. 
  On the other hand, Washington's proposal for a federation 
and 
confederation of Muslims and Croats and speculations about the 
Serbs joining the Muslim-Croat agreement indicate, to say the 
least, an inability to view the situation on the ground 
realistically, Krajisnik said, and went on to add: 
  It is only by pressure that a federation and confederation 
of 
Croats and Muslims can be set up; however, not even force can 
secure Serb participation. 
  In view of the above I think that the most logical way 
forward would be to sum up the negotiations so far, to decide if 
the Owen-Stoltenberg plan is dead, and to convene a new 
conference in which all three sides would take part and at which 
fresh proposals for territorial divisions between the three 
national communities would be submitted, Krajisnik said and went 
on to stress: 
  It is only the issue of territories that can be discussed 
realistically since we have already committed ourselves to a 
union of three independent states in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Krajisnik said in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Vlasimir Mijovic report from Moscow] </F>
  [Text] Today's one-day visit of Bosnian Prime Minister 
Silajdzic to Moscow passed without any of the spectacular 
statements that usually, though without any substance, adorn 
diplomatic talks on Bosnia. 
  They discussed peace initiatives, the engagement of the 
Russian troops in Bosnia, territorial divisions, and the 
Washington Muslim-Croatian agreement. During separate meetings 
with Andrey Kozyrev and Vitaliy Churkin, Silajdzic also raised 
the issue of establishing diplomatic relations of the government 
in Sarajevo with the Kremlin. 
  Judging from the statements that the protagonists of today's 
talks gave to journalists, nothing has happened that would give 
a new, more decisive impetus to the resolution of the Bosnian 
crisis. This especially refers to the meeting of Haris Silajdzic 
and Andrey Kozyrev, whose talks seemed to have been primarily of 
a courtesy nature. 
  What will influence the current peace process happened 
behind 
the doors of Moscow's Savoy Hotel, where Silajdzic and Yeltsin's 
special envoy for former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin held direct 
talks. It is only natural that talks behind closed doors are 
more frank; however, the public is told considerably less than 
could be said. Before Silajdzic's arrival in Moscow, there was 
much speculation about important messages that Radovan Karadzic 
would like to convey to the Bosnian prime minister via a Russian 
intermediary. Unfortunately, nothing can be said about their 
contents. 
  The Kremlin today also learned first hand of Croatia's 
views. 
Immediately after Silajdzic, the head of Croatian diplomacy Mate 
Granic entered one of the elite negotiating buildings of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry. He would not disclose the reasons for 
his hasty arrival in Moscow either, but it is hard to believe 
that the reason could be a mere routine exchange of opinions. 
  In any case, the results of today's Moscow talks will become 
more certain when Russian and U.S. diplomatic heads Kozyrev and 
Christopher meet in Vladivostok next Monday. It is no longer a 
secret that Washington and Moscow will shape (?importantly) the 
final agreement to end the Bosnian crisis. This has been 
Vlasimir Mijovic, permanent OSLOBODJENJE correspondent from 
Moscow, reporting specially for Bosnia-Herzegovina Television.

  [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Member Ejup Ganic 
received representatives of the Russian Battalion today, which 
as a part of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] is carrying out 
its duties in the [Serb-held] Sarajevo district of Grbavica. 
  After welcoming them, Dr. Ganic explained the current 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina to the Russian UNPROFOR soldiers 
and emphasized that the Serbs are not the only ones to have the 
exclusive privilege of cooperation with Russia. The legal 
Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities want this cooperation, too. 
However, as Dr. Ganic said, very little is known in Russia 
about the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian media do 
not have the correct information about the events on these 
territories. When the war is over, Ganic said, some politicians 
will perhaps have to answer for concealing war crimes committed 
on the territories of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The reason for today's meeting with the representative of 
the 
Russian UN Battalion was also the mistrust of citizens toward 
these soldiers, especially after seeing the television footage 
of their arrival in Pale. However, it does not seem that there 
will be any major problems. 
  The representatives of the Russian forces -- Assistant 
Commander of the Sector South (Aleksandar Mihaylovic) [word 
indistinct] and Commander of the Russian Battalion in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Victor (?Vorodilov) -- emphasized that they 
are merely a part of UNPROFOR and only accountable to the UN 
Secretary General and the UN Security Council.

  [Text] We have just received a report that Swedish Foreign 
Minister Baroness Margaretha Af Ugglas after her visit to Tuzla 
also visited Sarajevo today where she held talks with 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency member Ejup Ganic. Nedzad Leko 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Leko] After the talks with Dr. Ganic, 
Baroness Margaretha Af Ugglas stated to the journalists: 
  [Ugglas, in English with superimposed translation into 
Serbo-Croatian] I am very glad to be here because of the 
changes that have taken place in Sarajevo and because of the end 
of terrorist attacks on the town. I am also satisfied with the 
talks that are currently under way between the Bosnian and the 
Croatian Governments. Sweden supports the Washington agreement. 
We believe that there are numerous constructive elements in this 
agreement and I am pleased that Mr. Ganic sees it as a very 
positive matter. 
  I would like to say that the international engagement on 
Bosnia's behalf will continue. Once peace is restored, perhaps 
we will no longer need the Nordic battalion. However, Sweden 
will be here as a partner in the reconstruction of the country. 
I have also told Mr. Ganic that Sweden would like very much to 
help Sarajevo, which is alive and not a ghost town. 
  [Leko] The journalists were then addressed by Dr. Ejup 
Ganic: 
  [Ganic, in English with superimposed translation into 
Serbo-Croatian] [passage indistinct] blockade of Sarajevo. 
Since there is no more shelling, we wish to secure the return of 
citizens to their homes in all suburbs of Sarajevo. This is our 
next step. We also informed the guest about our desire to 
continue negotiations. We will call upon the Serbs to join the 
talks to find a solution for Bosnia, as there is enough space 
for everybody in the federation while the entire world wishes to 
make use of this advantageous moment. It is very encouraging to 
hear that our friends will stand by us in the future. 
  [Leko] Answering a journalist's question about the 
impressions after yesterday's visit to Tuzla, Baroness 
Margaretha Af Ugglas said: 
  [Ugglas, in English with superimposed translation into 
Serbo-Croatian] My impression is that there is still plenty of 
work to be done. There is a blockade and the industry around 
Tuzla cannot work because of it. However, I am encouraged with 
public works that are being carried out in the town itself, for 
example, the cleaning of the town. I believe that this is 
important. I was also satisfied with the work of the Nordic 
battalion. The situation in Tuzla is now more peaceful, 
however, there are still unpleasant incidents which is 
definitely something that we should combat, because I believe 
that our battalion should carry out its work in peaceful 
conditions. 
  What is very encouraging is that the airport has now been 
taken over by the Nordic battalion and that it will soon be 
opened for delivery of humanitarian aid. [end recording]

  [Text] UN military observers yesterday noted several 
cease-fire violations in the Sarajevo region, for which the 
soldiers of the Serbian aggressor's side were responsible. 
  Thus, one Bosnia-Herzegovina Army soldier was killed and two 
were injured in the vicinity of (?Hrasnica). On that occasion 
one aggressor's soldier was injured, too. 
  According to Major Jose (La Bandeira), UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] military representative in Sarajevo, one French 
soldier sustained minor injures on Mt. Igman yesterday when 
Karadzic's Serbs opened fire toward a French unit. Fire was 
also opened at French soldiers in (?Dupovici) yesterday, 
however, the shooting stopped when the French returned fire. 
  Major Jose (La Bandeira) says that six aggressor's howitzers 
continue to be positioned in Ilijas, 900 meters inside the zone 
that is supposed to be free of heavy arms. He did not explain, 
though, what UNPROFOR will do to remove these arms.

  [Text] The region of Bihac remains the focus of aggressor's 
offensive. Throughout yesterday the aggressor used howitzers, 
in particular, and tanks to pound the area. Three civilians 
were killed and dozens injured. The aggressor also attacked the 
defense lines and threatened the Bihac-Cazin road. Forces of 
the so-called "autonomasi" [anti-Izetbegovic forces] have been 
also been very active. 
  Attacks on Maglaj were of a slightly lesser ferocity but 
there were civilian fatalities nevertheless. Chetnik snipers, 
howitzers and mortars killed four civilians. Infantry attacks 
were repulsed. The humanitarian situation in the town is 
exceptionally difficult.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 10 March within its 
regular 8-minute newscast carries several reports on the 
situation in the Republic. 
  Reporting from Maglaj, Hajrudin Fermic says that "the 
chetniks are once again showing their criminal face and as well 
as an intention to kill as many civilians as possible and ruin 
the city. To do so, they are indiscriminately using all means, 
shells of all calibers, snipers, antiaircraft weapons. 
Yesterday afternoon, a new massacre was carried out in Maglaj: 
One person was killed and 13 civilians seriously wounded from a 
tank shell fired on the very center of the city from (Procijep). 
Many of those people will remain permanently disabled. 
Unfortunately, before this, four people were also killed 
yesterday by snipers and howitzer shells and mortar bombs. If 
we recall that the chetniks have again sent back a convoy 
carrying food, the picture of the Maglaj inferno, of the 
sufferings and agony of the population will be complete." 
  Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko that "last night on the 
Brcko battlefield did not pass without aggressor's attacks. The 
enemy used 82-mm mortars to pound Vranovaca, Cupici, (Kladanj), 
and [name indistinct], while infantry battles were waged in 
[words indistinct] of the Brcko battlefield." Further on, 
Deronjic says that "the aggressor's regrouping on the Brcko 
battlefield is more and more (?intensive). During last night, 
movements of enemy military trucks were noticed along the Donja 
Mrka-Lipovac-Donji (Radjici) line. Movements of chetnik armored 
vehicles have been observed on the central section of the Brcko 
battlefield, as well as along the Potocari-[name indistinct] 
line." 
  A correspondent reading a report by the 3d Corps (?Press 
Center) reports that "the chetnik offensive on the Zavidovici 
battlefield is going on" and that, as for other regions covered 
by the 3d Corps, "chetnik artillery is shelling (?Bugojno, 
(Dubac), and the free villages of the Donji Vakuf and Gornji 
Vakuf regions. Zenica and Travnik were shelled with a shower of 
projectiles. The truce signed between the Army of the Republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council (HVO) is 
being respected in general. However, there are still 
provocations, particularly by sniper fire." 
  Izudin Durakovic reports from Gracanica that "last night on 
this section of the battlefield passed in occasional 
provocations with antiaircraft machine-guns and antiaircraft 
guns on the defense positions and with Bofors guns on populated 
places. The defense lines are still stable and unchanged." 
  Mirza Sadikovic reports that "in the last 24 hours, the Serb 
aggressor's attacks on Bihac gained in intensity. Artillery and 
infantry assaults on the defense lines on both Bihac section of 
the battlefield and the Grmusko-Srbljanski Heights are 
particularly frequent." "Several howitzer shells were fired 
from (Goriok) at Bihac (?and its) outskirts and [name 
indistinct] region, as well as the Bihac-[name indistinct] road 
and villages on the right bank of the Una River are under 
constant artillery fire."

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, March 9 (AFP) -- A UNHCR humanitarian 
aid convoy blocked at Teslic, 30 kilometres (18 miles) from the 
north-west Bosnian town of Maglaj does not have a UN military 
escort, the UNHCR admitted Wednesday. 
  "We didn't ask UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] escort since 
it 
is not operating in this area," Peter Kessler, spokesman for the 
UN High Commission for Refugees said. 
  Asked about the UN Protection Force's mandate for protecting 
humanitarian convoys, UNPROFOR spokesman Major Jose Labandeira 
said the organisation had not agreed to force the convoy's 
passage through blockades. 
  "We don't want to use force. If we do it, they (the local 
Bosnian Serb militia) can destroy bridges and put mines on 
roads," Labandeira said. 
  Kessler said that the last UNHCR convoy which tried to get 
into Maglaj on October 26 was given a UN military escort. Two 
of the convoy's driver's were killed in the action. 
  Maglaj, which has a majority-Moslem population, has been 
under seige by Serb forces since last June. 
  UNHCR has supplied Maglaj by airdrops, some of which fell 
onto Serb lines, Kessler said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Doboj, Mar 10 (TANJUG) - Moslem formations continued 
on Thursday their offensive on Serb settlements and positions in 
the broader area of the Serb-controlled town of Doboj, in 
northern Bosnia. 
  The strongest Moslem attacks with artillery support are 
taking place on Mount Ozren and Mount Trebava, south and east of 
Doboj. 
  Bosnian Serb military sources said that Moslem troops from 
Zavidovici are trying to make a breakthrough in the area on 
Mount Ozren in a bid to link up with Moslem forces from Maglaj. 
  The same source said that Serb fighters stopped the 
attackers 
with effective fire and forced them to retreat. 
  The Bosnian Serb Army command said that Moslem Leader Alija 
Izetbegovic had ordered all his units to take Doboj and Mount 
Trebava at any cost and that fresh units from central Bosnia 
have been brought into the Zavidovici area for this purpose 
since Moslem-Croat fighting there had abated in intensity. 
  Moslem units launched several attacks on Serb positions 
north 
of Maglaj, in northern Bosnia, Bosnian Serb military sources 
said. 
  The Herzegovina corps of the Bosnian Serb Army said on 
Thursday that Moslem formations on several ocassions opened 
infantry fire on Serb positions between Mostar and Nevesinje, in 
southwestern Bosnia, on Wednesday afternoon. 
  After the fire was responded to, the provocations ceased, it 
was said. A complete lull reigned on this part of the front 
during the past several months.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 8 (TANJUG) -- Moslem forces on 
Tuesday fired mortar shells at a school in the Croat village of 
Uzdol near Prozor in central Bosnia. 
  Moslems thus violated the ceasefire which they had agreed 
with Croats on February 25, warned a statement by the defence 
ministry of the Bosnian Croat state of Herceg-Bosna in the 
former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Zagreb-based 
Croatian Radio said. 
  The radio also said that Moslem forces were bringing in 
reinforcements and regrouping their troops around Uskolje 
(former Gornji Vakuf) in central Bosnia. 
  Heavy clashes between local Moslems and Croats, former 
allies 
in their war against Bosnian Serbs, have been underway in 
central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina for over a year. The 
clashes have not ceased even after the two sides agreed to form 
a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The agreement 
was signed by representatives of Bosnian Moslems and Croats in 
Washington on March 1, under strong pressure from the United 
States. 
  Moslem forces opened strong infantry and artillery fire on 
Serb villages and positions in the area of Mt. Ozren, northern 
Bosnia, on Monday and Tuesday, Bosnian Serb military sources 
said. 
  The army of the Serb republic repulsed a Moslem combined 
artillery-infantry attack in the region of this mountain, the 
sources said. 
  Strong Moslem infantry attacks were also repulsed in the 
valley of the River Trebava and around Maglaj in northern Bosnia. 
  Moslem forces used helicopters to scout Bosnian Serb army 
positions in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, despite the United 
Nations resolution on a no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 9 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Croats oppose 
the placing of Mostar under European Union (E.U.) protection, 
TANJUG on Wednesday learned from well-informed sources. 
  They are going to propose that this city in southern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina be included into the Bosnian Croat state, 
while the Moslems would get one of the Mostar municipalities, 
i.e. the section mostly Moslem-populated before the war. 
  TANJUG learned that an E.U. mission, made up of high-ranking 
Greek, German and Belgian officials, is due to arrive in Mostar 
in the next few days, with a view to determining the 
possibilities of the establishment and implementation of the 
E.U. protectorate. 
  The Serbs residing in Mostar have been excluded from the 
division. Before the war broke out in April 1992, 24,000 Serbs 
lived in Mostar, accounting for one-third of the population. 
44,000 Moslems, 43,000 Croats and 12,000 residents, who declared 
themselves as Yugoslavs, have lived in Mostar at that time. The 
E.U. protectorate would ensure the return of the Serbs, who have 
been forced to leave the city under Moslem-Croat pressure. Over 
45,000 Serbs have been expelled from Mostar and the Neretva 
valley and nearly all of their homes, churches, monasteries and 
cemeteries have been plundered, and burned and torn down. Since 
early 1993, fierce Moslem-Croat clashes have been taking place 
in central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, during which the 
city of Mostar has been completely destroyed. 
  Under strong pressure from the United States, 
representatives 
of the Bosnian Moslems and Croats along with Croatian 
representatives signed in Washington on March 1 a preliminary 
agreement on setting up a bi-national federation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would subsequently enter into a 
confederation with Croatia, but the hostilities have never 
ceased.

  [Text] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, March 9 (AFP) -- Three 
heavy mortar shells fell on the city centre on Wednesday, the 
first such attack in two weeks against the UN-protected 
north-east Bosnian city. 
  The shelling which shook the city and sent people scuttling 
indoors at 4:30 p.m. took place just a day after the city's 
airport was placed under UN control. 
  Alarm sirens screeched and an ambulance raced to the site of 
the attack but no immediate information was available on 
possible casualties. 
  Bosnian Serbs are dug into positions some 10 kilometres (six 
miles) from the city. 
  Troops from the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
officially took control Tuesday of the airport some 15 
kilometres (10 miles) outside the city in order to airlift aid 
to some 700,000 hungry civilians. 
  It was not immediately known whether or not the airport had 
been hit.

  [Text] Geneva, March 8 (TANJUG) -- Spokeswoman for the U.N. 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sylvana Foa on Tuesday 
announced that the airfield near Tuzla, a Moslem-controlled town 
in north-eastern Bosnia, would be reopened in 7-10 days if 
everything went as planned. 
  At a press conference, Foa stated precisely that an 
agreement 
would be signed, envisaging which air corridors would be used 
and which countries would use the airfield near Tuzla. Runway 
of the airfield requiring a thorough repair is the greatest 
problem at the moment, said Foa. 
  The U.N. Nordic battalion on Monday began to deploy troops 
around the airfield near Tuzla. The agreement on the opening of 
the airfield near Tuzla was reached after Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic had given his consent, provided Russian 
observers controlled all air shipments, to make sure no arms, 
ammunition and equipment were supplied to the Bosnian Moslems. 
  Humanitarian land convoys pass through Bosnia mainly 
unhindered, said Foa and added that 7,320 tonnes of food, 
medicine and clothes were distributed last week, accounting for 
73 percent of the total needs. She confirmed it was the highest 
total reached by the U.N. in that former Yugoslav republic. 
  Foa, however, accused the Bosnian Serb side of what she 
called stopping of the convoys headed for Tuzla and eastern 
enclaves. 
  Bosnian Serbs check the contents of the convoys, because 
earlier experience had proved that they transported arms and 
equipment to the Moslems. Checking of the convoys does not mean 
their stopping, because all of them passed unimpeded and safely 
through the Bosnian Serb territory and reached the Moslem 
territories, as was confirmed by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] 
reports. 
  The bulk of humanitarian aid to which foa referred arrives 
from Yugoslavia via the Bosnian Serb territory to the Moslems, 
because this is the safest way since land routes from Croatia to 
Bosnia are unsafe due to one-year-old bitter Croat-Moslem 
fighting in central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Visoko, Bosnia-Herzegovina, March 9 (AFP) -- A 
25-vehicle UN Canadian convoy reached the eastern Moslem enclave 
of Srebrenica Wednesday to evacuate Canadian infantry troops 
blocked there by Serb forces for over four months, officials 
said. 
  Canadian Captain George Petrokeleas said in Visoko, 40 
kilometres (25 miles) northwest of Sarajevo, that the convoy's 
arrival meant that "a long and frustrating time is now over." 
  The infantry troops are to help monitor a Croat-Moslem 
ceasefire in central Bosnia. "We've needed them here for a long 
time. We didn't have enough infantry," he said. 
  The convoy of the Royal 22nd Regiment was to pick up 69 
Canadian UN troops and their equipment and take them to Visoko. 
  Serb forces have for months blocked the rotation out of 
Srebrenica, a UN-declared safe haven. The Serbs said the number 
of UN troops in the enclave, at full strength 160 Canadians 
before they started leaving last week, should not be increased. 
  But some 350 Dutch troops arrived in Srebrenica last week to 
relieve the Canadians. The Dutch UN force there is eventually to 
number about 600. 
  The Canadian convoy was held up at a Serb checkpoint about 
25 
kilometres (15 miles) northwest of Sarajevo for 30 hours before 
continuing its trek on Tuesday. 
  The Serbs said they did not want tracked vehicles on their 
roads anymore. 
  The convoy included five Cougar tanks and 15 trucks.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 10 (AFP) -- A French transport 
aircraft Thursday brought in the 100,000th ton of food aid to 
reach the Bosnian capital since the air lift began 20 months ago. 
  Its load mainly of flour was for the 350,000 people of 
Sarajevo still besieged by Bosnian Serb forces, although a 
ceasefire has been in force for the past month. 
  General Andre Soubirou, commander of the French contingent 
of 
the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in Sarajevo, said the airlift 
had enabled every Sarajevan to receive 500 grams (nearly one 
pound) of food per day. 
  At present 5,000 tons of food are being brought in every 
day, 
80 percent of it by air on British, Canadian, French and U.S. 
transports flying from Split and Zagreb in Croatia, or from 
Frankfurt in Germany. 
  At the same time, 500 badly-wounded victims of Serb mortar, 
shell or sniper fire have been evacuated for treatment abroad 
since the air lift officially began on July 3, 1992. 
  The airport straddles the front lines of the conflict, with 
each end of the runway in the hands of the mainly-Moslem Bosnian 
Army and the sides controlled by the Serbs. 
  In the middle are the UNPROFOR troops, presently numbering 
1,300 mainly French soldiers. 
  More than 100 UN soldiers have been wounded while guarding 
the airport, which until the ceasefire was regularly closed 
because of shelling or because aircraft were hit by small-arms 
fire. 
  Hundreds of people, both civilians and troops of the warring 
sides, have also tried to cross the opposing lines by way of the 
airport. UNPROFOR has orders to send them back each time they 
are caught, in line with an agreement declaring the facility 
neutral.

<F P=106> [Article by Michael Adler] </F>
  [Text] Visoko, Bosnia-Herzegovina, March 10 (AFP) -- In the 
center of the Moslem town of Visoko, haggard people crowd 
sidewalks and occasionally spill into streets as they haggle in 
black market trade. 
  Prices here are high, up to 70 German marks (42 US dollars) 
for one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of coffee, while in Kiseljak, a 
town Moslems from Visoko besiege in Bosnia's war, the price is 
eight marks. Cooking oil is 20 marks a litre in Visoko, four 
marks in Kiseljak. 
  In one of the paradoxes of war, Croats in besieged Kiseljak 
in central Bosnia are eating better and paying less than the 
Moslems who surround them. 
  The key is a narrow front the Kiseljak pocket has with 
Bosnian Serb forces, who continue to allow Croats to move 
supplies through their lines despite Serb anger over 
Moslem-Croat rapprochement, UN military officers and a leading 
Moslem businessman said Wednesday in Visoko, eight kilometres 
(five miles) northeast of Kiseljak. 
  The Serbs, under international sanctions for being the 
aggressor in Bosnia since fighting began in April 1992, are too 
needy themselves to pass up chances for food, fuel or hard 
currency. 
  An additional irony is that most of the goods coming into 
Visoko that are not UN humanitarian aid are from Kiseljak. The 
Bosnian war is between neighbors and there has been a continuous 
and considerable amount of trading across front lines. 
  Kiseljak is a sleepy, sprawling place of only a few thousand 
people with two small main streets and a suburban, residential 
feel surprisingly untouched by the war. 
  Visoko is a small city with a pre-war population of 48,000, 
now swollen by refugees. Many of its Turkish-style wooden 
houses with red-tile roofs, built along a curve in the Bosna 
river, are damaged by shelling. 
  UN Canadian Lieutenant Bruno Vanasse told AFP the Croats 
bring in a convoy once a week from Split, in Bosnian neighbor 
Croatia on the Adriatic coast. The convoy detours through 
Croat-held territory in southern Bosnia to avoid Moslem lines in 
the center of the former Yugoslav republic. 
  It then approaches Sarajevo from Serb-held territory in the 
southeast. Somewhere near Pale, 15 kilometres (nine miles) 
southeast of Sarajevo, the Croats pay their "tax" to the Serbs 
-- 30 percent of the goods in the convoy, Vanasse said. 
  The convoy enters Kiseljak through a Serb checkpoint just 
southeast of Kiseljak. 
  Vanasse said this arrangement has not changed despite the 
Croats and Moslems declaring a ceasefire in their fighting 
February 28 and moving to create a political federation, which 
for the moment has isolated the more powerfully armed Serbs 
against a common front though diplomatic efforts are underway to 
try to bring the Serbs into the process. 
  Asmir Hodic, a leading Moslem businessman in Visoko, told 
AFP 
the Serbs were furious about the Moslem-Croat alliance but were 
not about to stop the convoys to Kiseljak. 
  The only retaliation they have made is to demand six tons of 
fuel, instead of the previous three tons, as part of the price 
of entry to Kiseljak. 
  Hodic is himself an active trader with the Croats, 
exchanging 
leather goods made in his family factory and coffins in his 
funeral business against food. He has become one of the few 
people to use a UN checkpoint set up last week to guarantee 
freedom of movement on the road between Kiseljak and Visoko, 
Vanasse said. 
  Asmir, 27, runs the city funeral parlor in Visoko. He said 
he gives away most of the food he gets from Kiseljak but does 
sell some of it on the black market since it is the only way to 
buy the wood and parts needed for coffins as Visoko's city 
administration has no money.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gligorov's Interview to Bulgarian </F>
Television"] 
  [Text] In his interview for the Bulgarian National 
Television, President Gligorov stated several current issues of 
the political and economic situation in the country. 
  As for the Greek demands of changes in the Macedonian [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Constitution and 
its flag, he stressed he "had never given nor can now give 
promises" for possible changes by Macedonia, but these issues 
can be discussed in an effort to seek compromises. But, he 
said, no negotiating is possible in conditions of embargoes and 
preconditions. 
  In reference to the "Greek-Serbian" axis, Papoulias' visit 
to 
Belgrade, and the embargo that followed afterward, President 
Gligorov said he considers mutual relations between the Balkan 
countries to be their internal affairs. It is only important to 
accept Macedonia as an independent and sovereign state, whose 
existence is a condition for peace and stability in the Balkans. 
  President Gligorov does not believe that additional troops 
in 
Macedonia, whether Russian or from any other country, are 
necessary. He said present UN peace-keeping forces are 
sufficient. 
  Asked on the latest radicalization of the Serbian party in 
Macedonia, Gligorov stated he does not expect any border 
incidents (although they are not completely excluded as long as 
the war is on), because Serbs in Macedonia are given all 
possible rights. "I would be happy to see such rights for the 
Macedonians in Serbia," he added. Gligorov said the PDP [Party 
for Democratic Prosperity] split is a "normal process in a 
democratic state." The worst possible solution would be forming 
ghettos of any nationality. It is another issue what forces and 
what party option will come out as a winner. 
  Asked on Bulgarians in Macedonia, Gligorov said they have 
been given the opportunity to self-declare themselves in 
previous consensus. 
  The East-West corridor is a "priority matter" for the 
Macedonian president. Mr. Gligorov said he is personal friend 
with the Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev and said Mr. Zhelev 
is a man of wide democratic views close to his own.

<F P=106> [Article by E.Cz., M.U., and J.B.L.: "Pawlak-Rosati Meeting </F>
on Saturday"] 
  [Text] On Saturday [12 March], Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak will meet with Dariusz Rosati, candidate of the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] for the post of deputy prime 
minister and finance minister. Only after this meeting will he 
make a final decision concerning his appointment. Upon his 
return from India, President Lech Walesa said at the airport 
that he had not been consulted concerning Rosati's candidacy and 
that he does not know him. The SLD insists upon appointing 
Rosati as quickly as possible; the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] 
has not submitted any objections and has left the decision to 
the prime minister. 
  Yesterday's meeting of the coalition leadership at the 
Parkowa Hotel lasted only two hours. Jerzy Szmajdzinski, 
general secretary of the Social Democracy of the Polish 
Republic, did not conceal after the meeting that the SLD would 
like Dariusz Rosati to be appointed to the post of deputy prime 
minister and finance minister as soon as possible. "The prime 
minister is, by his nature, a tight-lipped man, and he is not 
willing to express his opinions," replied Szmajdzinski, when 
asked about the prime minister's opinion on the candidacy of 
Rosati. The prime minister has put off making a final decision 
until after his meeting with the candidate, for which "he 
reserved a lot of time." Dariusz Rosati told us on the night of 
8 March that he has an appointment to hold such a long meeting 
with the prime minister on Saturday and that he has so far only 
spoken with him twice on the phone. 
  Also discussed at the evening meeting was the announcement 
by 
National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk that he will 
submit an objection in the Constitutional Tribunal to the 
provisions of the Budget Law, which obliges the Ministry of 
National Defense to purchase equipment from Polish factories, 
including Mielec. 
  We hope, Szmajdzinski said on behalf of the SLD, that 
Minister Kolodziejczyk will be able to fully present his stance 
in the Senate. We get the impression that it is not all that 
clear. The Senate should hold a satisfactory discussion of the 
budget. In the Senate, Kolodziejczyk is supposed to take the 
floor on behalf of the government, not the ministry. 
  It was agreed that, after the government forwards the law on 
ratification of the Concordat to the Sejm, it will be necessary 
for parliamentary clubs to discuss the procedures, pace, and 
time of the first reading of this law. 
  The coalition members declared on behalf of the government 
that they are ready to conduct talks with Solidarity and reach 
compromises. 
  The PSL deputies are "quietly waiting for new developments," 
said Franciszek J. Stefaniuk, deputy chairman of the club, 
before the meeting at Parkowa street. The PSL has not submitted 
any objections to the candidacy of Rosati and left the final 
decision to the prime minister. Rosati's statement that he 
would continue the policy pursued by Borowski disturbs the 
peasants. "Why, we will not question the budget that we have 
ourselves passed," he says. "Rosati declares an honest 
privatization policy, which is exactly what we want." 
  "I do not know him personally; however, from publications 
and 
opinions of the milieu, I know that he was critical of the 
Balcerowicz plan, which draws us closer to him. One can count 
on good cooperation with him," said Sejm Deputy Waldemar Michna 
(member of the Budget Committee).

<F P=106> [Interview with General Tadeusz Wilecki, chief of the </F>
General Staff, by Zbigniew Lentowicz; place and date not given: 
"Our Strong Army; In 10 Years, Our Army Will Be Smaller but 
More Professional"] 
  [Text] [Lentowicz] Mr. General, you and your close 
associates from the General Staff, which is the chief organ for 
commanding the Armed Forces today, have been charged with 
personal responsibility for what the Armed Forces of the Polish 
Republic will be like in the future. What did you begin with? 
  [Wilecki] We deliberated very thoroughly the issue of our 
country's defense philosophy, alliances, and security systems, 
and, of course, we also used our national tradition as a basis. 
It is the General Staff's view that Poland needs an army 
consisting of conscripts and of professional military, with the 
length of the basic military service being of one-year duration 
in the future. As a general rule, our goal is to extend the 
popular duty of defense preparation to all citizens, and that 
goal is expressed in the draft of a future law on the popular 
defense duty. 
  [Lentowicz] Does it mean that you [General Staff] intend to 
cut down on the current list of possibilities for using 
postponements of military service again? 
  [Wilecki] We intend to reduce the list radically. It is 
obvious that some exceptions to the general rule of popular 
military service must be allowed for purely humanitarian 
reasons. But what is happening today proves that the law-making 
agencies that enacted the current provisions, in our view, 
committed a strategic error. Fifty percent of Polish youth 
manage to avoid military service for various reasons. 
  [Lentowicz] Professionalization is the other issue.... 
  [Wilecki] We want to achieve a considerable degree of 
professionalization of the service. Therefore, we will have 
soldiers of a professional service, a contract service, and an 
over-the-time service. At the end of 1995, we should reach the 
level of 16,000-20,000 over-the-time soldiers. That would make 
it possible for us to assign experienced "experts" to the most 
modern combat equipment units. 
  When it comes to military units today, only every tenth 
person who would like to do so has the chance of remaining in 
the service longer--that is, for another two to four years. 
  When one looks at current price lists, about a trillion 
zlotys [Z] will have to be spent from the state budget for 
making all over-the-time contracts operational. By the end of 
June--that is, after the experiment is over--we will know how to 
go about creating an image of that kind of service and also how 
to provide financial incentives for people to serve there in the 
most unrewarding kinds of posts. 
  [Lentowicz] The Vienna treaties imposed an obligation on us 
to further cut down on the size of the Army, which now stands at 
250,000. How many officers will simply be deprived of their 
jobs? 
  [Wilecki] Reaching a specific size of the Armed Forces 
(234,000) and also limitations regarding military equipment also 
largely determine the future of the internal structures in the 
Army. One had to come up with new, better, and more effective 
kinds of measures, and also to see to it that the necessary 
combat readiness of detachments and subdetachments be maintained 
during restructuring. As early as 1997, an organizational 
framework of the Armed Forces will be set up, with the Army's 
final form being reached in 10 years. We will then have a 
smaller Army but also a more professional one, and it will also 
have greater combat and maneuver possibilities. One cannot 
avoid cuts that will occur on the way to reaching that goal. We 
must give up the professional cadre, especially in the Army 
administration and in "logistical" support--that is, 
quartermaster, medical, and commissary services. Many posts 
currently occupied by officers will be taken over by ensigns and 
noncommissioned officers. We are approaching difficult 
transformations in the most rational manner possible. Reductions 
in officer surpluses are facilitated by a new law on retirement 
pensions, which makes it possible to leave the service sooner. 
Besides, the changes will be spread over many years. 
  [Lentowicz] So we do not face the danger of a rebellion by 
unwanted officers? 
  [Wilecki] I do not think we so. In the Polish Army, there 
is no problem with lack of discipline or insufficient 
subordination. The fact that currently there are 20,000 members 
of the cadre awaiting apartments or improvements in their 
housing conditions or that there are many military families 
whose members do not live together did not have an impact on the 
needs of the service, either. If only other state structures 
were in as good condition as the Army, I think our country's 
situation would be much better. 
  [Lentowicz] During the times of the Warsaw Pact, the Polish 
Army was supposed to be a home front for Soviet fronts. Right 
now, getting rid of the asymmetrical dislocation of forces 
established at the time is a problem. What will change after 
"Wilecki's model" is implemented? 
  [Wilecki] The backbone of our Armed Forces is made up of 
land forces that in peace time are concentrated in four regions. 
The fact that they will be organized into corps-division-brigade 
structures will make these forces more mobile and also more 
easily maneuverable and logistically supplied. Air forces are 
another important element--these are supposed to perform the 
role of an umbrella for the Republic of Poland during peace 
time, and they are supposed to be a "shield and sword" in 
wartime. Unfortunately, that type of military unit costs a 
lot--supplying new missiles or aircraft means enormous 
expenditures. 
  [Lentowicz] And yet you began the process of strengthening 
air forces with cuts and reductions precisely in the area of 
aerial military units. 
  [Wilecki] As recently as a few years ago, we had almost 
1,000 aircraft. Currently, in accordance with the Vienna 
agreements, we can have 460 at most, so it would be hard to 
imagine maintaining entire technical supply units or the 
elaborate services supporting the aerial equipment. 
  [Lentowicz] These days, no one any longer wants buildings 
and other items left behind by the Army, whereas the Army made a 
decision, for instance, to give up 20 of its airfields.... 
  [Wilecki] We have addressed supreme authorities to prepare 
the territorial government administration to receive not only 
that part of the legacy. It would be a shame if the entire 
infrastructure were to go down the drain. 
  [Lentowicz] What is the current value of the so-called 
superfluous military property? Has anyone tried to calculate 
that at all? 
  [Wilecki] What we intend to transfer to the national economy 
this year and next is, according to our calculations, worth 
Z80-90 trillion. That comprises 10-15 percent of the entire 
military property: garrisons, airfields, and training fields' 
infrastructure. There are also serious problems. As late as a 
few years ago, local authorities were pressuring us to eliminate 
garrisons; they demanded an immediate transfer of military 
sites, and we defended ourselves. Today, the situation is 
different: Demands are being made that the Army be present in 
every small town, every gmina [small administrative units] and 
voivodship [administrative units]. 
  [Lentowicz] Is there a fear? Of what? 
  [Wilecki] This is not just about anxiety. Apart from a 
certain stabilization and contributing to a sense of safety, an 
army is also a factor contributing to the establishment of new 
cities and towns. It creates "civilian" jobs, and, in small 
centers, it occupies a significant position on the market in 
terms of being a purchaser. However, we cannot afford to 
maintain a military infrastructure this huge. So we are 
gradually eliminating garrisons in the country's central 
regions. Last year, we completely eliminated 11 garrisons, five 
airfields, and seven testing grounds. This year, another 13 
garrisons will be eliminated, including some with a substantive 
historical tradition. We must dissolve 25 garrisons in total 
and reduce the number of troops in many others. 
  [Lentowicz] Do the cadre, the officers in the units 
affected, have a clear vision of the future? Do they already 
know where they will be assigned next? 
  [Wilecki] The answer is yes with regard to a substantial 
proportion of units that are being established on the basis of 
the new structure, while the remaining officers will be learning 
about that in due course. 
  [Lentowicz] Do you not think that the youngest cadre, in 
particular--that is, officers dating back to the 1980's--who are 
largely the result of a negative selection, will be able to 
influence the cadre's quality shortly, and that they perhaps 
will fail to meet challenges a modern army creates? 
  [Wilecki] Every now and then I hear about this negative 
selection theory. I am hereby stating officially that there has 
never been any negative selection in the Army with regard to 
cadre selection. At least as far as I am concerned, I cannot 
agree with such statements. You can never tell whether a young 
man age 20 something will definitely become a general or whether 
he will burn himself out in the Army as a captain. An army is a 
tough school of life, and often we are not the ones who decide 
personally where to go next. During 30 years of service, I have 
already changed my residence 11 times. 
  [Lentowicz] And yet, many military, in accordance with the 
spirit of the time, are beginning to regard the Army not as a 
vocation but as a profession. 
  [Wilecki] I do not think there is anything wrong with that. 
But still, my experience is that I do not come across 
subordinates who tell me that they only work until 1500.... That 
is, I have not come across them from the time I first put on my 
uniform. 
  [Lentowicz] Army restructuring makes it imperative to make 
choices. So who will be treated preferentially in terms of jobs 
or finances? 
  [Wilecki] Reconnaissance and radioelectronic fight units are 
priorities, as well as commanding systems and those systems that 
secure the Army's functioning under combat conditions. We will 
enlarge the entire antiarmor branch and also the antiaircraft 
branch, the so-called small technologies. We are also concerned 
with building a popular defense system that would be based on 
territorial defenses, among others. 
  [Lentowicz] And a Krakow district will have new experiences 
in that field? 
  [Wilecki] A new military district of Krakow will be the 
experiment's main site. Within three to five years, we will 
test new corps-brigade structures in the district, as well as a 
model of land forces, where air forces would have a significant 
contribution. We intend to secure maximum aerial mobility and 
maneuverability of the troops in the region by equipping the 
units there, among others, with Polish-made helicopters produced 
by the Swidnik plant. 
  [Lentowicz] That is if appropriate finances can be found for 
that. 
  [Wilecki] The final say has not been proclaimed yet with 
regard to the state budget. If the budget really stays the way 
it is now, including the rigid formula for expenditures that 
have been imposed upon us, we will have to make substantial 
changes regarding our purchase plans. That would consequently 
mean a withdrawal of orders, which have already been submitted 
to some factories, especially orders for armored weaponry, 
antiarmor and antiaircraft means, and also other means of a 
so-called small combat technique. By the way, I cannot 
reconcile myself with the fact that, through a vote by this or 
that Sejm deputy who cares only for his factory, we are forced 
to make purchases of items we do not really need. To make IRYDA 
the kind of equipment that would make us happy, one must still 
make a lot of changes in it. For the moment, the aircraft does 
not meet our expectations. Right now, we are waiting for a 
satisfactory final offer from Mielec. 
  [Lentowicz] Does the present budget make it possible for 
you to take any steps aimed at modernizing the Army? 
  [Wilecki] The time has finally come for radical decisions 
and measures. Our military technology is to a large extent 
decapitalized. We have argued for a long time now that a budget 
that equals 3 percent of the GDP would allow us to begin 
modernizing the combat equipment. We are still looking for 
internal reserves; however, tightening one's belt is possible to 
only a certain extent. 
  [Lentowicz] Today it is not only the extra parliamentary 
opposition that keeps saying that the Army is "becoming 
increasingly autonomous." You yourself keep the General Staff 
away from the press--that is, from the judgments of public 
opinion. Does the head of the General Staff feel that he is 
fairly controlled by the civilians? 
  [Wilecki] I think the political practice in the recent 
period has been healthy and rational. If we look at it through 
the prism of accepted customs here, we can say that the control 
is full. It is exercised by the president with his office, by 
the parliament with the Sejm National Defense Committee; the 
Supreme Chamber of Control has proved its competence for years; 
there is also my superior, the civilian minister of defense, 
with his entire very significant apparatus. The spokesman for 
civic rights also comes to visit our units. Therefore, I 
believe that there are enough controlling establishments. We 
propose, however, that these controls be followed by responsible 
and concrete decisions. This calls for appropriate provisions 
in the Constitution and other legal solutions. You can be 
certain that, if the head of the General Staff--let us call him 
"the first soldier"--has influence on the Armed Forces, all of 
the important decisions he makes are consulted with his 
superiors. 
  [Lentowicz] How often do you consult the president? 
  [Wilecki] Not very often. Let us say, as often as is needed. 
  [Lentowicz] Is this the result of the fact that the 
commander in chief trusts you entirely? 
  [Wilecki] We value the friendliness and understanding of the 
president toward the Army. The president has done a lot for the 
Army, and we are grateful that the atmosphere he has created 
allows us to carry out the transformation of the Armed Forces 
without any interruption. 
  [Lentowicz] Military people are saying many bitter words 
about parliament members. The present Ministry of National 
Defense [MON] head has reiterated them many times in public. Is 
this not going to be detrimental to the interests of the defense 
system in the Sejm? 
  [Wilecki] The previous and the present National Defense 
Committee are making efforts that must be appreciated. I am 
more critical of various groupings that, in a political fight 
and to achieve some temporary goals, exaggerate some problems, 
which are usually of secondary or even less importance and claim 
that they are strategic issues. This is not conducive to 
building the image of the Polish Army in the world. I am also 
often utterly upset by statements of irresponsible, accidental 
persons, who have not served in the Army and sometimes have had 
only a fleeting contact with our ministry. I also often 
reiterate that, in the area of defense, there are issues that 
are better discussed in the recess of an office, at a closed 
parliamentary session; we should not reveal our greater or 
smaller defense weaknesses at an international forum. 
  Interesting is the fact that, whenever we meet with our 
partners abroad, the Polish Army, not an exaggerated courtesy, 
by any means, is perceived as a strong, responsible, 
well-organized partner. 
  Actually, we are cooperating with all of our seven neighbors 
in the border areas. On the continent, we are looked upon as a 
considerable, medium-size European army that has temporary 
problems with technical equipment but that has valuable soldiers 
at its disposal. In comparison with some NATO armies, such as 
the Turkish, Spanish, and Italian Armies, we really should not 
be ashamed. All of those armies, apart from ultramodern 
technology, have equipment of previous generations; one can even 
find older tanks, aircraft, or drawn artillery there. 
  [Lentowicz] How should we explain the recent measures that 
practically subordinate the Military Information Services 
(intelligence and counterintelligence) to the General Staff and 
thus deprive the civilian minister of some of the powers he had 
before? 
  [Wilecki] Special services are an element of reconnaissance, 
and they are supposed to provide the Armed Forces with all of 
the necessary information and data. Military intelligence and 
counterintelligence must first of all be included in the state's 
defense system--that is, serve the purpose for which they have 
been established. 
  [Lentowicz] The case of the Military Information Services, 
transferring educational issues to the General Staff, as well as 
other steps of this kind lead one to believe that increasingly 
more prerogatives of the civilian head of the ministry are now 
being taken away from him and given to the military segment. 
  [Wilecki] There is no use exaggerating this problem. It 
must be remembered that, in the area of legal regulations, we 
have not done anything special thus far. In place of a 
totalitarian military commander, the head of MON, with enormous 
prerogatives and powers, we once put a civilian person who was 
entirely unprepared for that. It could be seen every single day 
that the duties were greater than the capabilities of those 
people. Thus, every single day people in uniform had to explain 
certain issues, so obvious to them, to the inexperienced 
politicians. We lost a lot of energy explaining issues of 
secondary importance to them; there were many clashes, whereas 
the main problems remained unsolved. Therefore, I believe that 
first the powers must be divided very precisely "in high 
places"; they should be regulated by laws. I want to know 
exactly what my responsibility is in the area of the state's 
defense, of which the Army is only a fragment, and what the 
responsibility of the minister, as well as other cabinet 
members, is. 
  [Lentowicz] The new bill on the general duty of defense has 
been prepared in the General Staff, so it does reflect your 
viewpoint. 
  [Wilecki] This is really a dilemma of our times. However, 
who else should have drafted this law? The problem was that no 
one else was ready or able to deal with this matter. We propose 
that the solutions that have been arrived at in the General 
Staff now be discussed by politicians. Perhaps we will avoid a 
legislative catastrophe, which came in the wake of the recent 
amendment of the Law on General Defense Duty, the programmatic 
content of which was at that time not discussed with the 
military. Only now can we evaluate that the authors were guided 
by wishful thinking, emotions, and not by the desire to approach 
the building of a new defense system rationally. Instead of a 
comment, I will only say that, when last year we volunteered to 
provide politicians particularly interested in these issues with 
the most fundamental knowledge about the Army and the state 
defense system, and even prepared for that in the National 
Defense Academy, no politicians accepted the offer. 
  [Lentowicz] The Army does not willingly accept changes; it 
has always been a slightly conservative establishment. However, 
soldiers in barracks have for too long been waiting for new 
regulations--disciplinary regulations, for instance--that 
determine the life of military communities in units. 
  [Wilecki] I do not want to make my subordinates happy by 
force; they were brought up in a certain tradition. I do not 
want to do that by means of solutions that would not be 
accepted. The proposals of regulations are currently being 
consulted on a low level. Now, as for the conservatism, with 
which the Army feels quite good, I will only say that other 
armies as well as our state establishments envy us that. In 
opinion polls, in which the Army has been in the lead for a long 
time now, this pinch of conservatism is obviously approved of by 
the people as well. 
  [Lentowicz] What do you think of the political games aimed 
at introducing another "coalition" deputy minister to MON? 
  [Wilecki] The structures of the ministry cannot be built for 
the people who come there. 
  [Lentowicz] Does the Army now have any concrete plans 
concerning the "Partnership for Peace" initiative? 
  [Wilecki] We are now getting down to the practical 
dimension, related to the implementation of bilateral and 
multilateral political agreements. In the middle of this year 
in Denmark and Germany, there will be exercises with the 
participation of Polish soldiers; toward the end of the summer, 
maritime exercises will be conducted. Staff discussions on 
these issues have already begun. We are also planning joint 
training with the French Army. Today my French counterpart is 
beginning his visit to Poland.

<F P=106> [Speech by Slovak president Michal Kovac to the Slovak </F>
parliament in Bratislava--live] 
  [Excerpts] Esteemed National Council [parliament] of the 
Slovak Republic! This is the first time in the post of 
president that I am going to deliver to you the report on the 
state of the Slovak Republic. [passage omitted] 
  We should not forget the negative foreign political 
consequences of our actions and decisions, such as the 
statements and actions of Slovak politicians abroad, which are 
not always precisely formulated and adequately coordinated, and 
sometimes even contradict each other. Such occurrences are 
given considerable and frequently exaggerated coverage in the 
foreign media. What is more serious still, such actions give 
rise to doubts about our foreign political orientation in the 
decisive political centers of the Western world. 
  This is most clearly demonstrated in the relatively frequent 
ignoring of Slovakia in West European politicians' addresses 
concerning the gradual integration of the postcommunist 
countries in European economic, political, and security 
structures. I think that so far we have not done enough to 
achieve a proper coordination of our foreign policy and 
diplomacy with the needs of Slovakia's economic development and 
international standing. 
  The frequency of official high-level bilateral political 
contacts is a good indicator of the international standing of 
our Republic. On the level of government contacts, in 
particular, such contacts are less frequent than in comparable 
countries of our region. This, too, demonstrates a certain 
tendency to wait-and-see by representatives of, above all, 
traditional democratic states. [passage omitted] 
  We know that the democratic policy of both the state and the 
political parties must focus on the citizen. It should be based 
on his needs and interests, and it should serve him. But the 
mood among the public, which I have noticed and which has also 
been confirmed by the regular opinion polls, testifies to the 
great dissatisfaction of the general public with the state of 
public affairs in our Republic, with the activity of politicians 
and political organizations alike, and with the functioning of 
the highest state bodies. We all must, therefore, collectively 
and very seriously consider what causes our citizens to feel 
such profound distrust in our state institutions and in the 
actors on our political stage. [passage omitted] 
  I have said repeatedly that, at the moment, when we are 
still 
going through the stage of building our independent state and, 
at the same time, through a major transformation process, the 
country should be governed by a government of a broader--or 
broad--coalition. What I have in mind is a coalition based on a 
proper agreement on the most important goals that must be 
achieved in order to have a consolidated state and public life, 
a coalition that could work systematically and consistently on 
developing and improving our country. 
  However, I am not ruling out other options for solving the 
current crisis, either--above all, through early parliamentary 
elections. In a democratic regime, such a step is perfectly 
legitimate; it is a proven method of arriving at a new 
parliamentary majority, and it may have a successful application 
in our couuntry, too. 
  The path to early parliamentary elections can lead either 
through a decision made by the deputies in parliament, or 
through a referendum on early elections. Personally, I am 
convinced that there is still enough time to decide this matter 
in parliament, on the basis of a sensible compromise. 
  We should not forget, however, that even a referendum will 
not make it possible to hold the elections any earlier than some 
time in the fall. [passage omitted] 
  The issue of national minorities, the Hungarian national 
minority in particular, has been at the forefront of attention 
practically from the very beginning of the great political 
changes in our country. The Constitution of the Slovak Republic 
provides guarantees to members of national minorities, who are 
equal citizens of our state, regarding all rights and liberties 
and the rights connected with their belonging to a minority in 
particular. [passage omitted] 
  I believe that we will promptly fulfill our pledges given on 
the occasion of our state's admission to the Council of Europe. 
I am convinced that such issues as the language used for names 
and the currency, or spelling local names in the language of the 
nationality living there, should be concluded as soon as 
possible. [passage omitted] 
  We cannot ignore the position of those Slovaks who live in 
ethnically mixed areas--above all, in southern Slovakia--and who 
are in a minority. I have received a number of communications 
stating that, within such an ethnically isolated environment, 
our citizens feel isolated and abandoned, their own state is not 
looking after them adequately, and, in their own country, they 
do not feel at home. I consider this situation unacceptable, 
and it is necessary to say quite clearly that responsibility 
here belongs to the state bodies of our Republic and to no one 
else. 
  The Slovak state must guarantee all human and civic rights 
for all citizens on the state's territory, including Slovaks 
living in an ethnic minority anywhere in Slovakia. These 
Slovaks, too, must enjoy the state's guarantee that they can 
consider any place in this Republic their homeland. 
  The problem of the Romany nationality, or rather the Romany 
ethnic group, has some particular characteristics. It is well 
known that, in the case of the Romanies, the ethnic and cultural 
issues are dominated by very serious social problems. Over the 
past 10 years, the government has tried various social 
experiments concerning the Romanies, but the results have not 
satisfied anyone. At the moment, the Romanies frequently become 
the first victims of the rising unemployment, and their social 
situation is beginning to show signs of further dramatic 
complications, a fact that is reflected in their state of 
health, too. [passage omitted] 
  In assessing last year's economic developments, we note that 
the pessimistic expectations of a collapse of the Slovak economy 
have not materialized. [passage omitted] 
  A closer analysis of the processes determining macroeconomic 
development reveals, however, a number of negative trends. 
First of all, the structural adaptation of our economy has been 
slow. In the course of the transformation process, production 
in sectors with a higher degree of added value recorded a 
considerable drop. The manufacturing sectors involved have not 
managed to compensate for the drop in domestic demand and in 
demand in the former Eastern markets by higher exports based on 
more exacting criteria. 
  Both the volume and number of investment projects have also 
been on the decrease. As an illustration: Since 1990, the 
volume of investments has dropped by 20 percent when price 
increases are taken into account. This further aggravates the 
technical and technological backwardness of the Slovak economy 
in comparison with foreign competitors, which in turn makes 
further significant positive structural movement impossible. 
  The worst manifestations of our economy's problems have been 
experienced in the development of the foreign trade balance and 
the state budget. In 1993, the state budget deficit was the 
most negative economic indicator. Its size was influenced by a 
number of factors, but the main cause must be seen to be in the 
objectively low performance of the Slovak economy. The current 
economic performance is too poor to create adequate means for 
the state to pay for services, even at the level to which 
citizens were accustomed. It also makes the financing of public 
investment projects impossible and does not leave enough 
resources for the further development of the private sector. 
  In 1993, our foreign trade ended up with a negative balance 
to the tune of 26 billion Slovak korunas. This goes to show 
that the export performance of our economy is not yet good 
enough to generate foreign currency levels sufficient to cover 
Slovakia's import needs. [passage omitted] 
  If a more pronounced contribution is to be made by foreign 
capital, we must make sure that the world finds in us a reliable 
partner. But I am afraid--and this has been confirmed by my 
talks with foreign representatives--that we have not sent out 
the right signals regarding this issue. [passage omitted] 
  The fact that, when we compare 1993 with 1992 we see an 
absolute drop in the volume of foreign investment in Slovakia, 
serves as a serious warning. [passage omitted] 
  For some time, the issue of internal security in our 
country has been attracting particular attention as well as 
causing considerable concern. Citizens are particularly 
sensitive to this problem because guarantees of personal 
security and the security of property belong to the foremost 
tasks of every state. 
  The growth of crime concerning property, which accounts for 
more than three-quarters of the total volume of crime committed, 
is alarming. The brutality of the crime committed, as well as 
the ever-lower age of young delinquents, is also causing 
concern. True, crime is concentrated mainly in large urban 
areas, but the sense of personal danger is beginning to be 
widespread. 
  The growth of corruption, which also affects state offices 
and banks, is also a worrying phenomenon. We must do all we can 
to prevent Slovakia at every level--from the highest offices 
down--from becoming a country of mafia gangs and corrupt 
officials. 
  I am mentioning these issues because, so far, these things 
have been only whispered, even in front of me. Instead, using 
thorough evidence, the issue should be dealt with openly and 
very specifically. The gradual elimination of the causes and 
factors contributing to the high level of crime therefore 
belongs to one of our fundamental tasks. On the one hand, the 
bodies of legal protection must get our wholehearted support, 
and, on the other, it is necessary to deepen social control over 
their activity because they must act within the limits defined 
by our Constitution and the law of our Republic. 
  Similarly, it is necessary to nourish the legal awareness of 
our citizens because the relatively low legal awareness in 
society makes a considerable contribution to the current poor 
state in law observance. 
  In the sphere of external security, we follow a singular 
orientation toward NATO and the Western European Union. Some 
citizens have written to me asking whether we are doing the 
right thing when, soon after doing away with one military 
alliance, we are showing interest in close cooperation with 
another, and whether this is being done for opportunistic 
reasons--that is, joining the stronger side. 
  True, such questions are atypical, but I would like to 
answer 
them nonetheless. Modern European cooperation means, above all, 
the utilization of all of the proven structures operating in 
Europe--and NATO, too, belongs to Europe. Our interest in 
cooperation with this group is therefore a part of our interest 
in a fully fledged integration of our sovereign state, with 
arrangements reflecting basic values. We have no enemies and no 
one endangers our state. We are convinced of the need for close 
cooperation with NATO not because of fears but because of the 
recognition of the fact that it is essential that we create a 
reliable security system around us. 
  The further we are from the memorable November 1989, the 
more 
apparent it is that the chronic economic crisis, and also the 
repeated crisis phenomena in political life, are a part of 
deeper processes that affected the countries of the Soviet bloc 
after its disintegration. In the rapid developmental process, 
the accepted principles and mechanisms of the social life of 
advanced Western countries were being inorganically linked to 
the prevailing mechanisms, habits, and overall mentality of the 
totalitarian era. 
  As a result of this, below-standard and hybrid conditions of 
life came into being in the countries of Central and East 
Europe, which, in a certain sense, also surprised Western 
experts and politicians. They called this hitherto unknown and, 
in its own way, incomprehensible fact postcommunism. In its 
substance, it remains the continuing version of state society, 
where the material and spiritual sources of dynamism have been 
exhausted. 
  Our public life now is portrayed by permanent political 
struggle. Its accompanying signs often are random verbal 
attacks, mutual accusations, various half-truths, and even 
downright lies and deviousness, which have only one aim: to 
discredit the political opponent. 
  Our internal political scene ceases to be a place where 
there 
is a constructive exchange of views, a search for common ways 
out of a complicated situation. It is changing into an arena 
with a number of duels leading nowhere, in which many lose their 
judgment, their own face and character. Zealous fighters for 
their own truth often put their own interests above the needs of 
the state. They do not see or do not want to see the 
difficulties to which Slovakia is being led by the 
confrontational line they nurture. 
  Unfortunately, we are witnessing how the nervousness of the 
political parties is increasingly being transferred to the 
citizens. On the other hand, it causes apathy toward internal 
political events, disenchantment, and mistrust of politicians. 
[passage omitted] 
  Today we are not only facing the task of definitively 
breaking away from the practices of the pre-November regimes, 
but we must also carry out the vitally important maneuver of 
dissociating our country from postcommunism. This objective can 
be achieved only if we rely on the broadest basis of social 
change, newly awakened citizenship. [passage omitted] 
  I propose that the National Council, the government, and 
the president's office nominate their own specialists to a group 
of responsible people who would set up a committee for dealing 
with questions of the strategic development of Slovakia [vybor 
pre otazky strategickeho rozvoja Slovenska]. The committee's 
task would be to ensure, in the organizational and conceptual 
sense and on the principles of the [word indistinct] system, the 
preparation of the necessary concept of modernization. 
  At the same time, I appeal to banking circles and nonstate 
organizations to support this entire project as much as they can. 
  I am turning to you, deputies of the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic, chairmen of committees and groups of deputies, 
leading officials of political parties and movements, 
representatives of the state authorities, leading officials of 
the state administration, and elected representatives of towns 
and village governments; I am turning to all of the citizens of 
the Slovak Republic who have the fate of their homeland at heart: 
  Let us stop seeing one another as enemies only because we 
have different views. Let us not seek only mistakes in one 
another. Let us not argue about trifles that are being 
uselessly blown up by some politicians at speakers' tribunes. 
This is a path that leads us to the brink of an abyss and might 
destroy us. Let us seek conciliation--political, national, and 
civic. Let us remember that the citizens of the Slovak Republic 
are partners, that they live in a common country, and that is 
why they must jointly bear all of the successes and losses of 
life. Let us seek paths to one another. Let us not give up, let 
us work on ourselves and our work. 
  Our joint success and the success of our country will be our 
reward. It is in the name of these ideals, esteemed deputies, 
that I decided to adopt a standpoint in the next part of my 
address on serious questions concerning our internal political 
situation. [passage omitted] 
  Many point to the autocratic way of the prime minister's 
governing. Whoever voices a different view or a different 
standpoint is gradually disloyal, lacking solidarity, and, in 
the end, becomes a traitor. 
  The conflict in the government, unfortunately, was 
transferred to the entire society. I get letters from citizens 
in which they express dissatisfaction with the fact that 
relations between the president of the Slovak Republic and the 
prime minister are not good. Some citizens blame me for being 
against the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], that I do 
not support the government and its prime minister. 
  Before explaining the situation and the causes of our tense 
relationship, I should like to say that I have not been and I am 
not against the HZDS and I have not been and I am not against 
the government. However, I have serious reservations about the 
style and ethics of Mr. Meciar's policies, about the way he 
conducts government and about the practices that create a 
confrontational atmosphere in political life. [applause] 
  The prime minister, since a certain time when he found out 
that I wanted to perform the presidential role in an assertive 
way, in the spirit of the Constitution, gradually started to 
ignore me, questioning my work and, gradually, he started to 
blame and discredit me so much that I thought it was designed to 
lead toward my being prematurely removed from the post of 
president. 
  I want to assure you in this connection that I never did 
anything against the prime minister. I only defended the 
autonomy and independence of the president of the Slovak 
Republic as the official head of state. [passage omitted] 
  You may well remember that, during my first visit to 
parliament after being elected president on 27 October 1993, 
there was no one from the government present in this room; today 
there are at least a few ministers here. [applause] The public 
understand it as a loss of esteem for the office of the 
president. You also certainly noticed how protocol is being 
infringed when the president is on official visits abroad and 
when he returns. The prime minister and often the chairman of 
the National Council of the Slovak Republic [parliament] ignore 
the state ceremonial, which is normal practice all over the 
world. [passage omitted] 
  The HZDS accused me of surrounding myself with people who 
were against the birth of the Slovak Republic, that I was 
setting up a new government, that some people from my office 
took part in secret talks in Prague on the possible setting up 
of a new Slovak Government, that I ganged up with the 
opposition, with representatives of the Hungarian political 
parties in Slovakia, even that I have been bought from abroad. 
  Following my New Year's address, the prime minister accused 
me of destabilizing the HZDS and the government of the Slovak 
Republic. 
  I resolutely and totally reject these and other accusations 
as being misconstrued and untrue. The main culprit in our 
internal political instability and unfortunate situation is not 
the president. 
  Allow me now to recall some events that characterize the way 
they behave toward me: 
  On 28 February, with Mr. Gasparovic, chairman of the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic, present, I told the 
prime minister of my decision to accept the resignation of Mr. 
Roman Kovac and Mr. Jozef Moravcik, provided I do not accept the 
proposal to fill the post of the minister of foreign affairs 
with Mr. Prokes. [passage omitted] Then I was asked by the prime 
minister whether it was true that I intended to invite the heads 
of districts to talks. I explained to him that I intended to 
visit some districts personally. I wanted to invite to 
Bratislava those whom I did not visit. The prime minister did 
not agree with this, claiming that I had no business to invite 
the heads of the district offices. He said that, wherever I 
went, I created the impression of being an enemy. He threatened 
that the heads who accept my invitation will be immediately 
sacked by him. After that, he accused me of being responsible 
for the current internal political situation. 
  I will not engage in deep analysis of the prime minister's 
viewpoint to the prepared visit of heads of district offices 
now. I only note that I must assess it as an unheard-of 
limitation of the constitutional rights of the head of state. 
[applause] [passage omitted] 
  So far, there have been only two meetings at which the prime 
minister briefed me on government sessions. It was not my 
fault. I waited for him many Tuesdays in vain, but the prime 
minister did not even bother to announce that he would not come. 
The prime minister also accused me of causing decay, while he 
was striving to unite and harmonize everything. The prime 
minister got the expected response from the audience for this 
misleading accusation against the president, accompanied by 
exclamations such as: Recall the president, and other offensive 
statements. [passage omitted] 
  The view of the foreign partner is an important factor in 
assessing the success or otherwise of the president's foreign 
trips. I can assure you that I know the assessment of my 
foreign trips at least as well as the prime minister, and, what 
is more, I have it directly from competent foreign 
personalities. I can state with full responsibility that their 
official assessments, including those on the talks with 
President Clinton and the visit to Poland, have been positive. 
  But why should anyone want to cast doubt on these objective 
facts? Particularly because, personally, I am pleased at every 
success achieved by the prime minister or by the speaker of the 
Slovak parliament--in fact, everyone who represents our Republic 
abroad. 
  I have always recognized and appreciated some particular 
abilities of Mr. Meciar: his industriousness, enthusiasm, 
brilliant memory, quick response, vehemence, above-average 
rhetoric, and ability to maneuver. I have no intention of 
questioning these abilities now. At the same time, however, I 
have had to accept many reservations pointing to his negative 
qualities, which must be mitigated so that his abilities might 
be used for the good of our society. [passage omitted] 
  The prime minister is not willing to cooperate as a partner 
and to conduct a correct dialogue. He cannot unite the varied 
groupings of citizens and amplify the political energy of the 
state. In view of his suspiciousness, he is capable of 
cooperating only with the people who are in some way obligated 
to him. Mr. Meciar does not need advisers, cocreators, and 
opponents, but only helpers in implementing his intentions. 
[passage omitted] 
  It is a pity that the prime minister is not here, but I do 
turn to him: I ask you, prime minister, for the sake of the good 
name of Slovakia, for the sake of democracy; think, without 
anger and hatred in your heart, about all that I have said here. 
Remember that Slovakia also belongs to different-thinking 
Slovaks and all of our citizens, that they have the right to 
their views, to their convictions. [applause] 
  But I ask that this sincere attempt and appeal of mine might 
not be explained as a weakness. All those who think that the 
president of the Republic can be intimidated are wrong. 
[applause] So are those who think that he can be discouraged 
from fulfilling his duties, which he festively undertook to 
fulfill. 
  The president will remain in the service of the people, of 
the citizens of the Republic until the end. He will remain 
faithful to the promise that he will see to the well-being of 
the Slovak people, national minorities, and ethnic groups, that 
he will observe and defend the Constitution and other laws. 
  Michal Kovac, president of the Slovak Republic, will never 
betray the Slovak Republic, his people, or his reason and 
conscience, even if he has to drink the bitter cup to the dregs. 
[applause] 
  I do not know how to hate anyone. I do not want to engage in 
intrigues against anyone, and I am determined ato responsibly 
fulfill all of the duties and use all of the rights of the 
president. 
  Esteemed deputies, in November 1989 we promised one another 
that we would speak the truth, that we would try to call things 
by their right names, that heads would not roll any longer, that 
we would be tolerant and decent, and that the bearing of grudges 
and hatred would come to an end. 
  In the spirit of these ideals, I am not asking Mr. Meciar to 
resign. But I appeal to all of you, including the prime 
minister, to unite forces and take steps that will start a stage 
of political, national, and civic reconciliation. I appeal to 
everyone to stop attacking one another, accusing one another, 
dishonoring one's opponents, and escalating the tension in 
society. Let us help everyone to help create a peaceful 
atmosphere for the early parliamentary elections and let the 
citizens decide about us. 
  We always have the chance to sit down together and agree on 
the rules and conditions for political, national, and civic 
conciliation in the interest of Slovakia and its citizens. 
  Thank you for your attention. [applause]

<F P=106> [V. Staresina report on news conference by Foreign Minister </F>
and Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Mate Granic in Zagreb; date not 
given: "The Way to the Final Solution"] 
  [Text] The Washington agreement is a historic one because 
it marks a definite geostrategic orientation of Croatia toward 
the West, and everything that follows, and the complete 
conciliation of the Croats, except certain marginal people, 
concerning the concept of Bosnia-Herzegovina and connecting 
Croatia to the Bosnia- Herzegovina federation. The current 
negotiations in Vienna concern the constitution of the future 
federation. In the next few days, the delegations in Vienna 
should determine the intercantonal demarcations, especially in 
central Bosnia, after which the negotiations on the demarcation 
toward the Serbs will follow. Once the relations with the Serbs 
are settled, then follow the talks on the model of the 
confederation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, said Dr. 
Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, before 
leaving for Moscow, where, as he remarked, he was going to 
demand a confirmation of the Russian recognition of the 
territorial sovereignty of Croatia. 
  Minister Granic pointed out that the Washington agreement 
was 
the expression of the continuity of Croatian politics, which has 
supported the model of a decentralized Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
the proposed peace plans since the beginning -- from Cutiliero's 
to Vance-Owen's to Owen-Stoltenberg's -- which offered various 
degrees of decentralization. The Croat-Muslim talks on a 
confederation started as early as last fall, when several models 
of the organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its relations with 
Croatia were discussed. 
  "However, there was no realistic force from the outside that 
would support one of the peace plans and become involved in 
their implementation, until, after the stagnation in the Geneva 
talks, the United States signaled that it would implement the 
agreement in consultation with Russia and the European Union," 
said Dr. Granic, adding that, following the U.S. decision to 
become actively involved in the peace process, U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore talked to President Tudjman on the phone, 
telling him about the U.S. initiative, which was accepted 
immediately, while, in the final stage of the Washington 
negotiations, President Clinton talked to the Croatian 
president. During the Washington negotiations, the 
consultations between Washington and Moscow, Washington and the 
European allies, and Granic and Tudjman were practically 
constant. 
  "The reaching of the agreement was welcomed by practically 
all the important countries. Many European countries 
congratulated President Tudjman. The only country in which the 
agreement has been received with some anxiety is Serbia," said 
Minister Granic, adding that the Bosniak side also accepted the 
agreement very well, that all the members of its delegation 
involved in the negotiations were interested in the 
confederation between the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and 
Croatia, and that the results on the ground, primarily those 
related to the ending of the conflict between the HVO [Croatian 
Defense Council] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, were beyond 
expectations. 
  As far as the special solutions are concerned, Granic said 
that western Bosnia would be a canton with the Muslim majority 
and one Croat municipality, while its demarcation with the Serbs 
is left to be negotiated. Posavina will be a canton with a 
Croat majority, considerably extended in relation to the present 
territory held by the Croats and Muslims, and will contain a 
corridor for the Serbs, but just a corridor. 
  Talking about the pressures on the Croats regarding the 
reaching of an agreement, Minister Granic said that the Croat 
delegation entered the negotiations with thoroughly worked-out 
models that also contained the proposal of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and its confederation with 
Croatia, as the United States had the information that most 
Bosniaks also wanted the same and just needed a mighty force 
that would support those wishes and give guarantees for their 
realization. Regarding the occupied areas of Croatia, Minister 
Granic says there are no written guarantees, but that U.S. Vice 
President Gore offered U.S. assistance in their reintegration 
should the agreement with the Muslims be reached. Croatia, on 
the other hand, will offer the United Nations, or rather the 
secretary general, its proposal for solving the problem of UNPA 
[United Nations Protected Area] zones based on Security Council 
resolutions (even on the one regarding the control of borders) 
but which would contain the means for their implementation. 
  Referring to the possible future course of the negotiations, 
Minister Granic concluded that the reaching of the Washington 
agreement and the active involvement of the United States 
crossed the Rubicon on the way to the final solution, for 
without coordinating Croat-Muslim relations, the negotiations 
could not go forward, and that, for the first time, this laid a 
firm foundation for negotiations with the Serbs.

  [Text] Brigadier General Jovan Divjak [ethnic Serbian 
deputy commander of B-H Army] spoke about the current 
military-political situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
agreement between our country and Croatia at a roundtable 
discussion organized by the Liberal Bosnian [as heard] 
Organization today. 
  According to Divjak, the pressure exerted by the United 
States, and especially the Vatican, on Tudjman has yielded 
results. The cease-fire agreement reached with members of the 
Croatian Defense Council [HVO] is mainly being observed. 
Generals Delic and Roso [of the B-H Army and the HVO, 
respectively] should meet in Split or Geneva in two days to 
define the principles of the military agreement. 
  According to this agreement, there would initially be a 
joint 
command for the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the HVO. This 
command would later be transformed into an unified command. The 
day when the third side will enter the federation is not far 
away, Divjak said. 
  The enemy's attempts to cut through the forces of the 2d and 
3d Corps by capturing Maglaj and attacking Vozuca from Olovo 
have failed. The offensive on Bihac and the Cazin Krajina has 
not yielded results either. The cases of resistance to 
mobilization, a lack of military discipline, and crime have 
become increasingly frequent in the [Serbian] occupied 
territories. It is thought that [leader of the Bosnian Serb 
military] General Mladic is out of favor as he did not succeed 
in accomplishing his aims in Sarajevo, the Krivaja valley, the 
Posavina region, and the Neretva valley. General Milovanovic is 
being mentioned as his replacement. 
  What is also important is that two brigades under the 
command 
of Fikret Abdic have refused to take any further part in combat 
actions against the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The situation 
in the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina is very good. The front with 
the HVO has been freed. The 7th Army Corps has been founded in 
the Vrbas valley. According to Divjak, the founding of a corps 
that would assume responsibilities in the Drina valley is also 
being considered. 
  Divjak stressed that the social situation of the fighters is 
very bad. The question of accountability for the loss of some 
territories has also been raised. The key person responsible 
for the loss of Mount Igman is under investigation. 
  General Divjak particularly emphasized the differences 
between demilitarization and protected zones. The 
demilitarization of Bosnia-Herzegovina can be discussed only 
after Serbia and Croatia have been demilitarized. The 
demilitarization of Sarajevo cannot be discussed while enemy 
soldiers are around the city, Divjak said. Just because the 
street cars have started operating, or because there was a 
soccer match between UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and Sarajevo 
teams we must not neglect the situation in Maglaj and Mostar, or 
the humanitarian situation in the republic. This is having 
adverse effects on other places in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Divjak 
said.

  [Text] President Sali Berisha this afternoon received Loic 
Bouvard, president of the North Atlantic Assembly, and Peter 
Corterier, secretary general of the alliance. 
  I would first like to express my deep gratitude for the 
contribution made to Albania's associate membership in the North 
Atlantic Assembly through an accelerated process, President 
Berisha said. I also have the pleasure of ascertaining that 
this visit of yours came after Albania clearly and finally 
demonstrated its Western pertinence. During the days of the 
ultimatum, Albania offered the alliance its ports and airports. 
We did so, first of all, to respect our Western roots, but to 
also defend those prominent values and principles that the North 
Atlantic Alliance has decided to defend in Bosnia. 
  We also signed the Partnership for Peace plan with pleasure 
because we consider it an active and dynamic process in 
Albania's full and dignified membership in the pact. We hail 
the achievements that are being observed toward a solution to 
the extremely complicated crisis in Bosnia, Berisha continued. 
However, we observe with concern that this facilitation in the 
north is also accompanied by an increase in tension toward the 
south. 
  There is an undeniable escalation of violence and terror in 
Kosova today. Out of revenge for the defeats suffered in the 
north, Milosevic is closing the last remaining legal 
institutions in Kosova one after another, such as the recent 
closure of the Albanological Institute and the harassment of its 
Albanian scientists. This is being carried out in full 
conformity with the memorandum of the Academy of Serbia, which 
anticipates the extermination and ethnic cleansing of the 
non-Slavic peoples in the territories included in Greater 
Serbia. We welcome and support the contribution made by the 
European Union, the United States, and Russia in resolving the 
Balkan crisis, but we ask for determination so that no one's 
presence can serve as an encouragement for the Serbs, who are 
the only aggressors, or serve their certain imperial aims. This 
would have had very serious consequences in the region's 
stability. 
  I am happy to be in Albania, Mr. Bouvard said, and I am very 
enthusiastic about Albania's associate membership through an 
accelerated process, because Albania has showed itself worthy of 
this membership. We applaud your achievements in the determined 
and difficult reform that you have undertaken in the army. We 
consider Albania a country that belongs to Western Europe and a 
country that is working for stability in the region. We are 
determined to contribute to its strengthening, because in this 
way we are contributing to stability in the region. We see 
every possibility of granting Albania full membership in the 
North Atlantic Alliance.

  [Text] The Albanian Helsinki Committee has addressed a 
protest to the Serbian Government, energetically reacting 
against the violent act of usurping the Albanological Institute 
in Prishtina. The protest states that this Serbian apartheid and 
segregation against the ethnic Albanians in former Yugoslavia is 
every day exterminating every kind of institution and legal 
structure of the spiritual and material world in Kosova. This 
is a manifestation of another form of ethnic cleansing, which 
the Belgrade authorities are practicing in Kosova. 
  The Albanian Helsinki Committee addresses all international 
institutions to stop, as soon as possible, these inhuman acts 
that incite and provoke the spread of war toward the south of 
Balkans at any cost. The committee feels that the European 
consciousness cannot stand indifferent when academies are closed 
in front of its eyes, cultural and academic institutions are 
locked, and art and culture representatives are beaten, 
maltreated, and imprisoned, thus challenging the European 
science and culture itself. 
  The Albanian Helsinki Committee expresses its conviction 
that 
the international public, as well as the recent approved 
resolutions accepting the CSCE Commission as observers against 
the violations of human rights of Albanians in former 
Yugoslavia, will exert their pressure to stop Serbian 
repression, apartheid, and segregation in Kosova.

<F P=106> [Interview with Milos Zeman, chairman of the Czech Social </F>
Democratic Party, by Ivo Slavik and Marek Stonnis; place and 
date not given: "CSSD Wants To Be Vigorous Rather Than Obedient 
Opposition"] 
  [Text] [LIDOVE NOVINY] How should the policy of the Czech 
Social Democratic Party [CSSD] look? We ask because your 
personal political practice substantially differs not only from 
Polish social democracy and Weiss's Slovak Party of the 
Democratic Left, but also from the conduct of the CSSD Deputies' 
Club in parliament. 
  [Zeman] First of all, I start with the assumption that Czech 
social democracy has, as opposed to Poland or Slovakia, where it 
was not very strong between the wars, a certain tradition that 
must be respected but not blindly followed. There was a 40-year 
suspension here, while the West European social democracies 
progressed. We are approaching the Western political culture 
only very slowly, and sometimes the communist way of thinking 
prevails within us. [German Social Democratic Party (SPD) 
leader] Rudolf Scharping, for instance, in a televised 
discussion, described [German Chancellor] Helmut Kohl as an 
overgrown infant with cottage cheese on his brain, and the 
German voter takes it as something completely normal. If I used 
the same expression, I would be marked as a cryptocommunist, at 
least. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] After all, the SPD is shaped differently, 
and its supporters are not pining for communist "security." 
Moreover, the alternative you offer is very vague and rather 
confrontational toward the hitherto changes.... 
  [Zeman] I do not believe it is vague. It is based on the 
idea of solidarity. There are three maxims in the West European 
concept: freedom, justice, and solidarity. Every political 
party, even those that do not really mean it, will tell you 
today that it advocates freedom. Solidarity is the idea that 
society should take care of the people who will reach the state 
of not only social, but also human need. The entire problem 
rests in the fact that solidarity cannot be just a passive 
protectionism. We must seek an active policy aimed at the 
creation of new jobs, the development of the education and 
health-care systems.... If you set yourself this goal, the 
question immediately emerges of how to finance it. No program 
can be complete without answering this question. The difference 
between social democracy and, say, the Civic Democratic Party 
[ODS] is quite obvious on this point. 
  Just as we do not say that ecology is only the icing on the 
cake, we do not claim that the market will solve everything. We 
want society to have a long-term concept. We need industrial 
policy, structural policy, exports-enhancing policy, transport, 
and energy policies. If the government economists occasionally 
tell us that they do not need it because the market will solve 
everything, we disagree because we know that it all exists in 
the advanced economies. We did not make it up. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Nonetheless, the need for a long-term 
positive perception was also expressed recently by a cofounder 
of the ODS, Miroslav Macek, in RUDE PRAVO. Likewise, in the 
right-wing parties, there are, if not trends, then individuals, 
who perceive certain things in a broader context. In comparison 
with them, your approach to politics does not belong to the most 
fortunate ones, particularly, as the public trust in the 
government is high, and social or economic tremors are not 
expected. 
  [Zeman] We certainly do not wish for any social or economic 
tremors. It is irrelevant, however, what we wish. What is and 
what is not a realistic possibility is important. Yes, the 
government has the trust of the majority at this time. 
Although, if you browse through public opinion surveys, you 
will see that the trust has declined over the past three months. 
Let us ask, however, whether we are to respond only to the 
problems that are topical at a given time or also to those that 
will emerge in the foreseeable future. We have practically no 
unemployment, or it is very low, but it is becoming a regional 
phenomenon. While the government economists interpret the low 
unemployment as something favorable, we claim that it is, in 
effect, overemployment caused by the stagnation of industry 
restructuring. At the same time, industrial production is 
dropping. Another question is linked to the creation of 
regional development programs--in Ostrava region, for instance. 
Phasing down programs are occasionally mentioned, but almost no 
one will say what substitute to offer for the original jobs. 
That is, if we disregard the various plans for reforestation, 
grassing over, etc., which are about as realistic as Baudys's 
plan for a peaceful settlement of the situation in Bosnia. 
  We simply lack a combination of the market and extra- or 
supra-market mechanisms. That is where I see a specific 
difference. I read the interview with Mr. Macek. His long-term 
vision is reminiscent of Khrushchev's Communist Party program: 
Already this very generation will live in communism. I am 
repelled by all political parties without exception, which claim 
that theirs is the only acceptable way. If they offer a bright 
future and shining tomorrows, I do not care whether the shining 
tomorrows are communist or market because, in both instances, it 
is just an illusion. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Nevertheless, people trust the ODS and Civic 
Democratic Alliance [ODA], and it is, above all, the young and 
the better educated who believe in them. Does it not prove 
something? 
  [Zeman] I believe that it is given by several factors. Of 
course, the declining social economic situation hit the 
pensioners the hardest. 
  I would say that a certain ebb will ensue. Of course, some 
young dissatisfied people are attracted by the 
republicans--precisely by their radicalism. They have simple, 
understandable answers. Social democracy does not know simple 
answers. It does not know slogans of the type "the market will 
solve everything." 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Certainly, but we are more interested in 
the reason for the small number of younger supporters of the 
CSSD.... 
  [Zeman] Every generation must pass through political 
puberty. At the beginning of the 1950's, many intelligent young 
people trusted the communist ideology. Of course, we have not 
admitted it even to ourselves, and we pretend we were a nation 
that maintained an anticommunist resistance for 40 years. Well, 
and now, suddenly, because communism was of course abhorrent, it 
is only a natural reaction to say that the more the obvious 
opposite of communism is established, the better for us. I 
believe that Zhirinovskiy in Russia indicates to us that there 
is some nonlinear dependence. Extremes meet in a particular 
manner. The extreme left and the extreme right are often hard 
to distinguish. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Neither the ODS nor the ODA can be 
considered the extreme right. Moreover, the people have the 
opportunity today to compare the communist and the West European 
models of society according to their own experience. 
  [Zeman] The possibility of a comparison is not given by a 
trip to the West lasting several days. In a superficial, 
short-term view, you often realize the actual problems just as 
little as the Western tourists perceive ours. Anyway, that is 
not the issue. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Nevertheless, it was precisely the CSSD 
supporters, together with Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia 
[KSCM] supporters, who most frequently named [Association for 
the Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia chairman] 
Miroslav Sladek in public opinion surveys as the 
second-most-acceptable alternative. 
  [Zeman] If you want to support your argument by public 
opinion polls, I must point out that, to the question of which 
is the second-most-attractive party, the ODS supporters replied 
that the ODA is, while the ODA supporters named the social 
democracy. I do not wish to draw any definite conclusions from 
it, but I rather tend to believe that the support by the 
younger-age groups for political extremes is caused by a certain 
impasse, desperate situation. There are also numerous 
privatization and corruption problems. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Your party claimed that it would 
consistently determine and disclose corruption affairs, and 
nothing much has happened.... 
  [Zeman] A lack of information is not an argument. We have 
published, for instance, the Aero Holding affair. We proposed 
that an investigation commission be established. The government 
deputies rejected this proposal. I ask, why? We published the 
Plzen breweries affair. I am not accusing you of violating 
Article 102, but, even as we speak, you are at variance with the 
claim made by Interior Minister Jan Ruml, who publicly declared 
that the social democracy is responsible for the Wallis affair. 
Of course, I do not claim that we are. I only say that 
Minister Ruml believes it. 
  At the time of the Hradec congress, we were assured by the 
former leadership that we are the wealthiest party, so we 
assumed that investigation teams composed of lawyers, 
journalists, and economists would be established. When we 
learned that we are not able to finance these teams--which we, 
of course, learned only after the congress--it slowed us down 
but did not change our attitude. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] You said that some parties offer simple 
solutions. Would you not say that your statement "we are after 
the government's throat" qualifies for such a denotation? 
  [Zeman] A statement of the "we are after the government's 
throat" type is used in the West by opposition politicians on a 
daily basis in an infinite number of variations. I can 
understand that, in a country nursed on the communist political 
culture, such a statement seems rather out of place. 
Nevertheless, let us not be hypocrites. If we keep saying that 
we want to get closer to the Western political culture, we must 
understand that a certain, albeit rough, exchange of invectives 
between the government and the opposition is an organic part of 
it. I attended a conference of the British Labour Party in 
Brighton recently. There, [Labour Party Leader] John Smith 
recommended that the British Conservative Party replace [British 
Prime Minister] John Major with the winner of the last Liverpool 
[Grand National] steeplechase--i.e., by a horse. As you might 
have observed, I have not suggested that Vaclav Klaus be 
replaced by Zeleznik [Pardubice steeplechase winner]. Hence, I 
am somewhat more moderate. During the U.S. presidential 
campaign, George Bush said that his dog Millie understands 
foreign policy better than Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton, as 
opposed to Mr. Hruska [district police chief who sued Zeman for 
comments on his education], did not sue George Bush for damages 
of $100,000. We may dislike it. Let us ask why we dislike it. 
Whether it is not just that we are used to an opposition of the 
National-Front type, but, then, the National Front has never 
been an opposition. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] You claim that your party does not offer 
simple solutions. It seems, however, that your bon mot 
attracted more supporters to the CSSD than its complex program. 
  [Zeman] The fact that we are not able to offer simple 
solutions and that a positive program, of course, is more 
complex and continues to develop does not mean that we would not 
use, like any opposition party in the West, also formulations 
that will point out to the voters that we are a vigorous and 
aggressive rather than an obedient opposition. After all, you 
have an example in the parliament of a constructive and 
accommodating opposition. It is Hirs's liberal, social, 
national, and who-knows-what party. I do not have the feeling 
that the Czech political scene can in any way benefit from such 
an accommodating opposition. An opposition that is not 
attacking and trying to replace the ruling party in the next 
elections is not an opposition. It is only a certain 
modification of that well-behaving National Front type of party. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] The claim that coupon privatization is a 
fraud belongs to the simple slogans. Nevertheless, several 
hundred thousand more people have registered for the second wave 
of registration than did for the first wave, and some investors 
made a nice profit. Would you not say that your conjecture is 
rather controversial? 
  [Zeman] The enterprises privatized by the coupon 
privatization methods have two possibilities: The first, less 
common, has most capital shared by small investors. You will 
see that, in such an instance, the management virtually cannot 
be recalled. The other possibility, and one that occurs more 
frequently, has most of the share capital owned by privatization 
funds. The privatization fund is, however, a stockholding 
company in its own right. It has small shareholders 
exclusively. Thus, the management of these stockholding 
companies called privatization funds cannot be recalled, either. 
At the same time, one of the basic principles of the market 
economy is the right of the owner for an efficient control of 
the management. Our enterprises are de facto owned by the 
managers. I do not question their talents or efficiency but, 
rather, point out that, because of links from the past era, many 
of these managers are people who were brought up under the 
former regime and who, under the present system, when no 
sufficient legislative barriers exist, can have the tendency to 
bring the enterprise to bankruptcy, start their own company, and 
operate it at the cost of the quasi-privatized enterprise. They 
can also reach an agreement with a foreign capital company that 
does not always come to this country with such good intentions 
as to bring in the know-how and new technology and utilize the 
advantage of cheap labor but can be, instead, interested in 
eliminating a local manufacturer to open the Czech market for 
its own products. I am not claiming that it always is the case. 
I would wrong our managers--and I respect many of them. I do 
claim, however, that it can happen and that it is actually 
happening already in a marginal number of cases. That is my 
principal objection to coupon privatization. Yes, let us say 
that the Harvard Funds or any other fund will pay more for a 
share than its symbolic book value is. I say--and what? We all 
live and are going to live in this country. We all are going to 
depend on the output of our economy--i.e., on the output of the 
industrial enterprises. If we opted for a privatization method 
that reduces this output, we will all have to pay for it and 
will notice it in the lower standard of living, in our real 
income, and also in what is called the quality of life. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Some time ago, you said that there is no 
discrepancy between your annual report and the analysis by Mr. 
Novotny. So, why such a long discussion about something that is 
not controversial, and why did the Central Executive Committee 
members receive only the first part of Novotny's material and 
not the whole thing? 
  [Zeman] One has to realize that material regarding electoral 
preferences was discussed by the presidium approximately one 
month after it was received. So, you cannot say that the 
reaction was belated. This is the part that was put at the 
disposal of the Central Executive Committee. Regarding the 
second part, I believe that the discussion should continue. We 
are seeking ways to make us a more efficient opposition rather 
than an obedient one. I do not like parties that claim their 
congress to be the most important event of the year in domestic 
politics if they state, at the same time, that nothing 
significant happened at this congress. Every live party should 
contemplate its mistakes because its eventual successes are 
brought about by the voters, and, therefore, they do not have to 
think about the successes. We are perceived as an alternative 
to the current government policy, and if it is to be viable, it 
must be continuously cultivated. I pity the parties that do not 
do it. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] On the outside, the CSSD seems to be a party 
full of controversial and contradicting analyses, materials, and 
reports. 
  [Zeman] You are starting from two unmentioned assumptions. 
First, a party, in which there are no discussions and possible 
alternatives of development or hypotheses are not compared is a 
better party than one in which discussions are taking place. 
Second, you believe that, if the deputies' club of a party is 
assessed in at least two different ways, the party must be worse 
than one that has a unified opinion in its deputies' club. Both 
of these assumptions, which you did not mention but are valid, 
nonetheless, can be questioned. In the Middle East war, only 
two types of missiles were used. Unguided ones, which could not 
correct their course during flight--i.e., the Scud missiles. 
They mostly fell down in the desert and caused only minor 
damage. The guided, self-correcting antimissile Patriot 
missiles mostly hit their targets precisely because of the 
self-correcting feature. The social democrats are trying to be 
like these guided missiles. That means a missile that corrects 
its course in flight. We consider the politics of the ruling 
parties, particularly the ODS, which are often intoxicated by 
what Fulbright called the arrogance of power, an uncorrected 
course. So, ask yourself what is more expedient. Is it not to 
contemplate the possibilities and talk, make a decision, and go 
on? I myself asked that we take stock of our situation after 
one year. We could have kept saying how successful and great we 
are, how the nation admires us, and then come to the Ostrava ice 
arena [as Klaus did] and learn the opposite. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] God forbid that we would think that a 
party in which there are no discussions, or only one person 
discusses the issues, is better than a party in which 
discussions take place. The opposite is true. It seems on the 
outside, however, that there is not much willingness for 
discussion in your party.... 
  [Zeman] Two or three months do not solve the problem. 
Nonetheless, I can say that there is a proposal in my report to 
the Central Executive Committee that our Central Committee, 
which has held a 120-member-body meeting for one day every two 
or three months so far be divided into specific working sections 
that will deal with certain problem areas. The Central 
Committee working sections should identify the questions that 
are felt to be the most burning problems. I completely agree 
with Ota Novotny on this count, and that is also how I 
understand his proposal. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] You spoke about those simplifying slogans. 
We believe that your report was a simplifying one. We are 
referring to the part in which you demagogically spoke about our 
right wing as having fascist tendencies.... 
  [Zeman] Jiri Vcelar Kotas, who has been explaining to us in 
this country for a long time what an authentic right wing is, 
said once that the more right it is the better. That is on the 
record. I polemicize with this statement because, just as the 
left wing per se is nothing harmful, while in its extreme 
form--i.e., the communist form--it certainly is harmful, so 
there is nothing harmful on the conservative right wing. 
However, as soon as it reaches the extreme forms--if the space 
for the application of democratic institutions is reduced, the 
powers of the Supreme Control Office limited, and if, after the 
abolition of the Prosecutor General's Office, we transfer to the 
state attorney system, one of the self-correcting mechanisms is 
weakened--an intermediate stage ensues. Let us call the first 
stage an authoritarian one. It is happening again that the 
posts in the state apparatus are filled according to the party 
membership and not according to the qualifications. I could 
name other forms of nondemocratic tendencies. The proof by 
contradiction means that you try to simulate what happens as you 
reach the end of this process. Even if the end is very remote. 
My report says: fascist tendencies in their extremes. That is 
a common form of expression when you are trying to say how 
bitter the ends would be precisely because you want to prevent 
their actually taking place. You try to point out that you have 
set off on an avalanche slope, for instance, and want to go 
somewhere else. You are glad when the avalanche does not occur. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Of course, Mr. Kotas does not represent our 
right wing. He is more of a tragicomic figure.... 
  [Zeman] Our right wing is Mr. Kotas. It was Mr. Kotas who 
said that the more right, the better. I repeat that this 
statement is complete nonsense. Mr. Kotas declared himself a 
right-winger, and, in his time, he was known to a nonnegligible 
part of the public as a representative of the right wing. I 
must respect this fact.

  [Text] As we already reported, a Hungarian military 
delegation has paid a visit to our country, during which 
Lieutenant General Janos Deak, commander of the Hungarian Army 
and chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Hungarian 
Republic, and Lieutenant General Dumitru Cioflina, state 
secretary and chief of staff of the Romanian Armed Forces, 
signed the draft on bilateral cooperation activity in the 
military domain for 1994. 
  According to a statement made to our reporters by Lieutenant 
General Dumitru Cioflina, the aforementioned draft was signed in 
order to continue a number of such activities that were also 
included by the similar drafts for 1992 and 1993, such as the 
Open Skies action, professional exchanges of experience, and 
cooperation between military units in the joint border area. 
The chief of staff of the Romanian Armed Forces also said that 
the new elements included in the current draft refer to 
cooperation between the archive bodies of the two ministries, 
cooperation with respect to the security principles of [Danube] 
river shipping and ways to implement those principles, exchanges 
of experience in the education and training of military cadets, 
and in the two armies' relations with the civic society. 
Another element included in the draft refers to the regulation 
of the status of military cemeteries on the territory of the two 
countries. 
  According to a news item broadcast yesterday by the 
[Hungarian] Duna Budapest Television, Lieutenant General Janos 
Deak stated that on the basis of the Romanian-Hungarian military 
cooperation program 20 joint actions will be organized. The 
commander of the Hungarian Army emphasized the fact that the two 
countries' armies do not have, quote, a mutual enemy image, 
unquote, about each other.

  [Text] Today the Senate resumed its plenary session. At 
the opening of the session, upon a proposal made by Senator 
Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu, the senators marked their regret 
over the persons who fell in the struggle against Communism by 
standing silently for a minute. Following this, they resumed 
discussing the draft bill on the organization and functioning of 
the Romanian Police. 
  An amendment proposed by the Democratic Union of Hungarians 
in Romania [UDMR] parliamentary group stirred a fierce dispute 
among the senators. Among other things, the amendment 
stipulates that, quote, in the territorial-administrative units 
in which the ethnic minority inhabitants represent the majority 
as compared to the total number of the population, the newly 
appointed or employed personnel of the police must be able to 
speak the language of that ethnic minority, respectively, must 
come, in a sufficient number, from among the persons belonging 
to that ethnic minority, unquote. 
  However, the amendment was then rejected, as merely 16 
senators voted in its favor. 
  The debate continued after a short break. The most important 
article that was discussed by the end of the morning session 
referred to the sentencing to life imprisonment of persons who 
kill police officers in the exercise of their duty. 
  Our correspondent, Victor Spirache, also reports that, after 
discussions were suspended on that draft bill, a number of 
senators made statements in their own name on various issues.

<F P=106> ["Statement by Prime Minister Lyuben Berov on Adoption of </F>
1994 Budget," made in the National Assembly in Sofia on 1 March: 
"Accents in the Government's Activity"] 
  [Text] Albeit with considerable delay, the National 
Assembly has passed the 1994 Budget of the Republic of Bulgaria. 
For the government, the adoption of the budget in a certain 
sense signifies a vote of confidence in the policies it is 
following. However, this vote is also an occasion for 
considering certain problems and the main directions of the 
government's activity in 1994. 
  First, one should stress that the present government was 
elected by the National Assembly on 30 December 1992 on the 
basis of its declared program at the time, which in its 
principal directions remains in force even now, insofar as no 
party or parliamentary group in the majority coalition (after 
having been publicly invited to do so on two occasions in recent 
months) has so far declared that it wants any adjustment to the 
government program in terms of retracting or amending any of the 
main directions for the national economic and domestic policies 
that were formulated on 30 December 1992. In this connection I 
am bound to state firmly that several statements by certain of 
our opponents are completely groundless; these statements claim 
that the process of restoring land titles has stopped and is 
being blocked throughout the country; that certain basic 
restitution laws are about to be repealed; that preparations are 
being made to settle accounts with members and sympathizers of 
the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces], and so on. These are 
propaganda ploys. The government has never considered doing 
this, and will never allow such things to be done. They are 
wasting their time in trying to scare people with such bugbears 
as the possible restoration of the old nomenklatura to leading 
posts in state service and the enterprises, the restoration of 
the old labor cooperative farms, an alleged plot against private 
business, a realignment of foreign policy, and an assault 
against the judiciary. 
  Many criticisms can be leveled against the government, and 
it 
will accept them; nevertheless, the government is bound strictly 
to observe the laws and the democratic principles of the 
political system embodied in the Constitution -- the principle 
of the separation of powers, preservation of human rights, and 
so on, based on which a democratic political and economic reform 
is being carried out in the country. 
  Against the background of the adopted 1994 budget and the 
continuation in force of the government program of 30 December 
1992, I must state that during the coming spring months the 
government will concentrate its efforts in the following fields: 
  1. Improving the administration of state property and 
privatizing this property according to the law and the specific 
program approved by the National Assembly. This will be 
achieved by tightening the state's requirements relating to the 
existing supervisory boards of state companies by consistently 
applying Council of Ministers Decree No. 17 of 1994 and directly 
linking the remuneration of the board members with the financial 
and economic results achieved for each quarter by the 
enterprises under their supervision. A considerable number of 
privatization transactions have already been initiated. In 1994 
it is planned to privatize 320 state enterprises, using the 
existing, mainly market methods of privatization. When the 
National Assembly completes the second reading of the mass 
privatization program (often referred to as the social 
privatization program), which has a schedule with a deadline of 
August this year, a further 507 enterprises will be privatized. 
These make up almost 40 percent of the total capital held by the 
existing state companies. All this will be one of the main 
prerequisites for a turnaround of the national economy and 
starting the economic revival. 
  2. The government is drafting a scheme of incentive 
measures for private business (which will not have a negative 
effect on the state budget and not involve any granting of 
public money either directly or indirectly.) 
  This scheme will include a package of measures to stimulate 
the domestic markets for a number of industrial and agricultural 
products, measures for encouraging exports, measures to provide 
low-cost credit facilities for small and medium-sized businesses 
through the relevant fund formed under the international 
programs that have been worked out, and so on. The measure will 
be directed more toward private businesses in the production 
sector, because so far those with private capital have mainly 
preferred to invest their money in trade and other forms of 
middleman activities, which does not help to increase the GDP. 
I have often stated publicly that the government has given and 
will continue to give a helping hand to representatives of 
private business who, while pursuing their normal desire for 
profit and furthering their personal interests, commit 
themselves to sharing the fate of the people around them and 
help to achieve specific tasks of nationwide importance. 
  3. The government is working on additional measures in the 
field of social policy during the period of the structural 
reform. For example, additional compensation will be provided 
for consumers of thermal energy in the larger towns, in 
connection with the sharp rise in the cost of this service. 
Every quarter, pensions will be indexed in line with the 
expected consumer price index, not according to the index of the 
preceding quarter, and the state system for monitoring prices of 
essential goods will be extended in scope. 
  4. Now that the budget has been adopted, as of today a 
system of measures takes effect that is designed to free the 
country from its relative financial isolation that it has 
suffered until now. This will be achieved by resolving the 
problems regarding the necessary payments of settlement, with a 
view to finalizing the interim agreement on the foreign debt 
that has already been signed, increasing the inflow of foreign 
investments, providing state help for those wishing to enter new 
foreign markets, and so on. 
  5. One of the government's main tasks will be to restrict 
inflation further, bringing it down from the 64 percent 
experienced in 1993 to 40-45 percent or lower in 1994, which 
will be a step toward the financial stabilization of every 
Bulgarian family. 
  I consider that all the foregoing clearly outlines the 
directions of the government's activity in 1994. Some people 
continue to stake their bets on a confrontational, black against 
white conception of the political situation and the country's 
political future. Such a primitive use of a formula that is 
already outdated for Bulgaria does not lead to the development 
of a stable state policy during the period of transition. I 
think that, at the present political juncture and in the present 
difficult economic situation, a neutral, broadly based 
government of experts without any party bias is best able to 
preserve political and social equilibrium and lead the country 
to a brighter future. 
  Our government has demonstrated that it can work on a 
professional basis, and it will continue to work with all the 
political forces that have constructive attitudes and are able 
to suggest pragmatic solutions in the general national interest 
and for Bulgaria's prosperous future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak by Martin </F>
Hric; place and date not given: "Concerning Information In and 
Out of Uniform"] 
  [Text] The government approved a long-awaited 
document--the Slovak Defense Doctrine--last week. We asked 
Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak for an interview on not only 
this document, but also some of the allegations that have been 
made recently. 
  [Hric] Mr. Minister, the six-page text of the doctrine and 
its characteristic features suggest that this is more of a 
political document than a military-strategic one. Is this in 
order? 
  [Andrejcak] It is, after all, an exclusively political 
document. It expresses our aims and objectives. I think that 
the world accepts these principles and that Central Europe will 
be a region of peace. 
  [Hric] Have other states also drafted a defense doctrine in 
such a form? For instance, as far as we are aware, the 
Hungarian doctrine is of a more specific nature from which the 
structure and deployment of the Army evolve. 
  [Andrejcak] It is impossible to assume a direct link between 
the published text of the Defense Doctrine and the specific 
activity of the Army. Military experts react to this political 
manifestation of the state's will by adopting specific technical 
and organizational measures and by creating the financial and 
material resources necessary for peace time and a possible 
conflict. 
  [Hric] The fact of the matter is, we are drafting a defense 
doctrine in Slovakia for the first time. Until now, we have 
always accepted them from our powerful patrons--the French, the 
Germans, and the Soviets. 
  [Andrejcak] Such a comprehensively formulated military 
doctrine is unique in the postcommunist states and is also rare 
in the rest of the world. As a rule, to me, this doctrine 
outlines the ideas, views, and activities--their 
declarations--of the state's political and military 
representatives. 
  [Hric] Is it at all practical to devise a military doctrine 
without formulating the possible risks and dangers? Although we 
can imagine the diplomatic fireworks, what would happen then? 
  [Andrejcak] We have defined precisely the internal and 
external risks in the Principles for the Slovak Republic's 
National Security. However, no states are mentioned there 
because we declare our interest in friendship with all states on 
the basis of equality. For this reason, I do not think it is 
necessary, even in this document, to identify the cardinal 
points. Soldiers have to be able to react to any potential 
threat to the state, regardless of the direction from which it 
comes. However, this is a question of military strategy and of 
military craft, which is not promulgated in public documents. 
  [Hric] A too strong army, as well as a weak one, is also a 
source of instability. The former arouses anxiety, while the 
latter arouses the ambitions of neighbors. Do you think our 
Army has reached the exact level of so-called reasonable 
sufficiency? 
  [Andrejcak] The concept of "reasonable sufficiency" evolved 
during the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact when the treaty on 
conventional armed forces was being drafted. A means of 
reducing the disproportionally high number of weapons in Europe 
and of maintaining the certitude of equal security for states 
was being sought. The number of troops and weapon systems 
proceeds from the extent of the territory and size of the 
population of this or that state. This principle and term were 
also used during the division of the former Czechoslovak Army. 
The 2:1 ratio corresponds to the size of our population and the 
extent of our territory. However, the treaty allows us to have 
slightly higher numbers than a proportional NATO member would 
have. We have a permitted ceiling of 46,000 officers and men; 
if we were to reach the level of the Netherlands or Belgium, we 
could reduced the number of personnel to 35,000. If Central 
Europe reduces the number of personnel to below the level set by 
the treaty on conventional weapons, we will also reduce our 
numbers. 
  You are right. A weak army is, on the whole, a pointless 
waste of money--as is too strong an army. The principle of 
sufficiency proceeds from the certitude of a potential adversary 
that, in an assault, he would suffer such major losses that, 
compared with the possible gains, it would not be worth starting 
one at all. However, it is not necessary to have a 1:1 ratio 
for this; it is also possible to defend oneself with smaller 
forces. 
  [Hric] One of the reservations of Mr. Slota was that, during 
the division of the Federal Army, we did not immediately proceed 
with restructuring the division system into the more efficient 
brigade system. Was this realistic? What is the situation in 
other states? 
  [Andrejcak] Some people see the brigade system as a 
condition for our entry into NATO. This is not true. Countries 
coexist within NATO with either system. The future of the Army 
lies in the brigade system for completely different reasons. 
These include the geopolitical position of our state, the 
possibilities for the troops' combat function, and the need for 
forces in individual directions. That is, smaller units than 
today's divisions are necessary but functional separately to 
conduct combat activity for several days. We could transfer to 
a brigade system today. However, we would be responsible for 
reducing Slovakia's defense capability. For instance, a brigade 
needs a communications system virtually at the level of a 
division. Until we resolve this issue, we can only form 
specialist brigades--which is not a transition to a brigade 
system. 
  [Hric] The issue of the home guard is brought up 
repeatedly; people here note that, in the United States, the 
National Guard almost copies the structure of the Army, 
including being equipped with pursuit aircraft. Could you 
reiterate the Defense Ministry's point of view? 
  [Andrejcak] No home guard unit is formed in peace time. In 
the event of a threat, it will be formed from the same caliber 
of people that complement the field army. The planned units are 
called territorial army units, but, if people desire the name 
"home guard," they can be renamed. The aims are the same, 
regardless of the name. However, it would make no sense at all 
to form such units in peace time, within the framework of the 
permitted numbers, to the detriment of the units that have far 
more complex equipment and training. 
  [Hric] Did Mr. Klepac not have something else in mind when 
he made this demand? 
  [Andrejcak] Certainly not. He made it at the time of the 
joint Federal Army so that the units on our territory would have 
a Slovak command. There is no reason now to create a new 
ministry or other command for the "home guard." Two systems 
cannot protect the same territory without cooperating with each 
other; that would be nonsense. 
  [Hric] Although Prime Minister Meciar repeatedly emphasized 
his satisfaction with the division of the Federal Army (as 
opposed to the division of the fleet, the airline, CEDOK, and so 
on), Mr. Slota has publicly aired his misgivings that you have 
filled Slovakia with military scrap. 
  [Andrejcak] I suggested to the two prime ministers before 
the division of the Army that they appoint commissioners. The 
governments then appointed commissioners for individual sectors. 
They supervised the calculations of the group attached to the 
General Staff, for which I was responsible. The commissioners 
approved the fundamental principle of division and the 
correctness of the calculations. This is a matter of the level 
of information. I warned the commissioners in advance that they 
will sign documents on the division, and, in the event that 
doubts are expressed, they have to be prepared to thoroughly 
defend them. I am convinced that these hundreds of people did a 
perfect job. It is necessary to identify a problem and then 
express an opinion on it. 
  [Hric] The Association of Slovak Soldiers repeatedly 
reproaches you for making alleged cuts of 400 million korunas, 
despite the shortage of apartments or resources for training. 
  [Andrejcak] This is another old wives' tale that I have to 
keep on explaining ad infinitum: We adhered to the rules set by 
the government; we did not keep even a heller for ourselves. 
The accounting term leaked out and was misinterpreted. After 
all, we could not keep any money in our account because, on the 
contrary, we had to borrow for the apartments. 
  [Hric] And, finally, according to opinion polls, as far as 
Slovakia's defense is concerned, 31 percent of the citizens 
trust the president, 17 percent trust your ministry, and only 3 
percent trust the government. Just 2.2 percent trust us 
journalists, so we have nothing to sneer about. 
  [Andrejcak] According to the periodic polls conducted by the 
Statistical Office, the Army as a whole is repeatedly in first 
or second place. We have our internal problems. These include, 
for example, bullying. However, when an 18-year-old youth has 
been getting away with it for years, he does not believe the 
commanders that this is punishable in the Army. We need to 
increase the feeling of patriotism and to get our commanders to 
be more exacting. Many commanders have jumped a couple of grades 
of management and have to learn. However, these are the Army's 
internal problems, and we will deal with them. 
  [Hric] Thank you. We will keep our fingers crossed for you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian </F>
Democratic Movement, by Peter Toth; place and date not given: 
"Shall We Be the Pariah of Europe?"] 
  [Text] [Toth] You have returned from a meeting of the 
European Democratic Union [EDU] Steering Committee. Did you 
discuss with Andreas Khol, the EDU secretary general, the 
petition for a referendum [initiated by the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia], which he had called undemocratic a few 
days earlier? 
  [Carnogursky] I discussed this issue with Andreas Khol at 
the margin of the meeting. He confirmed his position that the 
EDU and the Council of Europe would consider the exclusion of 
elected deputies from parliament undemocratic. The issue of the 
observation of democratic rules in Slovakia would be raised in 
the Council of Europe in that case. As a matter of fact, this 
problem is known also from Albania, where a group of deputies 
broke away from the Democratic Party. This party, too, wanted 
to deal with this problem like Vladimir Meciar, but it finally 
abandoned its intention on the basis of warnings from 
international organizations. These deputies now represent an 
independent club of deputies in the Albanian parliament. 
  [Toth] You have spent approximately one week in the West. 
What is the view there of Slovakia, which is experiencing a 
crisis? 
  [Carnogursky] Slovakia is slowly but surely becoming the 
pariah of Europe. Compared with all other countries of the 
continent, it is declining. 
  [Toth] The Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] used to have 
a relatively good position in the EDU, particularly from the 
viewpoint of lobbying. Do you think that your credibility, or 
the effectiveness of KDH lobbying, might suffer, in view of the 
political and economic crisis in Slovakia? 
  [Carnogursky] The KDH's credibility will not suffer, but the 
effectiveness of lobbying will because it can only be done to a 
certain degree. Simply, when Slovakia gets itself into too many 
"troubles," these cannot be mitigated by lobbying. 
  [Toth] What does this mean for us, and what should be 
changed for Slovak diplomacy to gain scope for lobbying? 
  [Carnogursky] A wide range of steps is involved, which I am 
unable to enumerate at present. But rendering impossible a 
legislative amendment that would allow the exclusion from 
parliament of deputies [who have left the party, on the ticket 
of which they had been elected] would definitely be one of these 
steps. In economic policy, the generation of a budget deficit 
and the borrowing of money from abroad that is not reasonably 
covered must not continue. And a foreign policy must not 
continue, about which it is not clear where it is heading.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jan Slota, chairman of the Slovak National </F>
Party, by an unidentified EXTRA SLOVENSKO reporter; place and 
date not given: "Nationally Aware `Diehards'"--reprinted from 
issue No. 9 of EXTRA SLOVENSKO] 
  [Text] "Mr. Slota, you were elected chairman of the Slovak 
National Party [SNS] at an extraordinary party congress, where 
you "steamrolled" not only Ludovit Cernak but also Jozef Prokes. 
What are your ideas regarding cooperation with your coalition 
partner, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]?" [HZDS 
weekly] EXTRA SLOVENSKO No. 9 asked Jan Slota, the new SNS 
chairman. 
  [Slota] There exists a treaty regarding this issue, signed 
by the former SNS chairman. No one from our party has cast 
doubt on this treaty thus far so we continue to act in its 
intentions. This is not to say, however, that we are 
"subordinating ourselves" to the HZDS or that we represent some 
platform within the framework of that movement. For example, we 
have fundamental reservations about Defense Minister Andrejcak. 
We support the HZDS also with regard to the referendum. I am 
convinced that a minimum of 12 to 14 percent of nationally aware 
Slovak "diehards" live in Slovakia. These people must be 
persuaded that we are not hopping [from one extreme to another] 
but that we stick to our line and pursue our target. 
  [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] You have proclaimed the return to national 
principles. Could you explained that in greater detail? 
  [Slota] We proceed from the priorities of the SNS, which 
are, first and foremost, securing the independence and defense 
capability of the Slovak Republic at any price. This is the 
Army's assignment. Unfortunately, many of the highest positions 
in the Army are held by officers of Czech or Hungarian 
nationality. Apart from that, the soldiers are poorly trained. 
Another priority is education, a sphere in which the assertion 
of the national principle ranks last. After all, it is immoral 
when citizens of the state-forming nation are being assimilated 
on the sovereign territory of the Slovak Republic! And, at long 
last, there is culture. It is abnormal when we support from the 
state budget the publication of press in Hungarian, which is 
incessantly spitting on this Republic. Let us wake up, Slovaks! 
  [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] Will you contest the elections 
independently or together with the HZDS or, possibly, with the 
Christian Social Union? 
  [Slota] This can only be decided by an SNS congress. I can 
only express my personal opinion. It is 100 percent sure that 
we will obtain substantially more votes than in the last 
elections. It goes without saying that we are interested in 
nationally oriented forces--in particular, gaining seats in 
parliament--lest we have a Hungarian-Bolshevik parliament. That 
would mean our end as a national republic. 
  [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] After your election as SNS chairman, you 
declared that Zhirinovskiy was an interesting personality and 
that time would show what was going on in Russia. The world is 
dissociating itself from him, however.... 
  [Slota] Why should it dissociate itself? Zhirinovskiy is a 
deputy to the Russian parliament and 40 million Russians voted 
for his party! One can only have reservations about some of his 
statements. When someone speaks four languages, including 
Turkish, he cannot be a madman. 
  [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] Would you be able to invite him to 
Slovakia? 
  [Slota] I would not want to comment on that. 
  [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] What are your ideas regarding cooperation 
with Prime Minister Meciar? Do you think you will come to an 
agreement? 
  [Slota] I think that, essentially, there exists no reason 
for us not to talk constructively. This does not mean, however, 
that somebody will be there just to fill the numbers.... There 
is much common ground between us, where our thinking is 
identical.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mark Griffin: "Feeling Familiar Tremors in </F>
South Slovakia"] 
  [Text] As news of the Jan. 8 meeting of Slovakia's ethnic 
Hungarians in Komarno filtered through, one could discern a 
certain sense of deja vu about the whole affair. With leaders of 
the minority group gathered to condemn government proposals for 
new administrative boundaries, what transpired was a debate 
about the "sufferings" of the Hungarians at the hands of Slovaks. 
  While not detracting from the aspirations of a minority to 
express its identity, the situation provides more than a few 
worrying parallels to the pre-World War II conflicts between the 
Czech government and the Sudeten Germans in Bohemia and Moravia. 
Nazi Germany's extreme irredentism (the desire to regain lost 
territories) has no modern parallels, but the transnationalism 
of Hungarian minorities in Central Europe is similar to that of 
prewar German minorities. 
  Such parallels figure prominently in Slovak minds. German 
reunification in 1990 showed borders can be changed. To deny 
that possibility in the case of Slovakia would be gross naivete. 
  A campaign for minority rights poses more questions than it 
answers. What has to be dealt with is an equation of the rights 
and duties inherent in any concept of citizenship. This is 
problematic in a liberal democracy. 
  What is needed is a complete reformulation of the concept of 
citizenship. While this might seem theoretically removed from 
the aspirations of the Hungarian minority, the recurring theme 
of this conflict is self-administration. For the Slovak 
government, this would amount to a step toward redrawing the 
border. Hungarians both in Budapest and in South Slovakia rarely 
miss an opportunity to internationalize local tensions, shunning 
subdued solutions. 
  If the means of solving the problem are to be international, 
then there must be an unequivocal recognition of the borders of 
all of Hungary's neighbors. To make the situation conditional on 
minority rights precludes any settlement of an increasingly 
amplified dispute in southern Slovakia. 
  Add to this the communal memory and mutual recriminations 
over changes to the Slovak-Hungarian border between 1938 and 
1945, and one can begin to understand the nervousness of the 
Slovak government. Slovakia is a new state with a fragile 
coalition government and a history of tense relations among 
ethnic groups. 
  The government surprised few when it pursued a thinly veiled 
attempt to change voting districts to dilute the electoral 
composition of the more ethnically Hungarian districts. In 
return, the proposals presented at Komarno by the Hungarian 
minority were, likewise, less than realistic. 
  The Trianon agreement of 1920, which pared Hungary to its 
present size, remains for most Hungarians the ultimate betrayal 
and injustice, leaving large communities of Hungarians stranded 
in four foreign countries. This is a bitter pill they have never 
swallowed, though they have grudgingly accepted their neighbors' 
borders. The problem now is that Central Europe is a region 
where politics are not designed to facilitate solutions. 
  It's understandable that this minority should look across 
the 
border for support, given geographical proximity and the 
compactness of communities along the border. As Dutch Foreign 
Minister Louwe Kooijmans suggested on a recent visit, it would 
be more in the Hungarians' interest to seek an internal 
accommodation rather than work through a neighboring government. 
  While the danger of minorities being used by certain sectors 
of the Hungarian political spectrum are present, the perception 
of potential manipulation is more destabilizing than the 
reality. This is the Slovak national nightmare and the plaything 
of conspiracy theorists in both Slovakia and Hungary. 
  By sending a clear signal of recognition to both the Slovak 
government and its Hungarian minority, Hungary would play a 
positive role and deflate the nationalists on both sides. 
Accepting Trianon and thus undermining potential conflict is the 
only effective gesture that can lead to a settlement. 
Unfortunately, we are facing a deficit of constructive politics 
in the region. 
  A lasting solution may be found with Slovak President Michal 
Kovac's decision to invite a delegation of parliamentarians from 
the European Union to deliberate on all administrative boundary 
proposals. This was, of course, unique--the first time the issue 
has been internationalized by the Slovaks, in this case 
constructively.

  [Text] Belgrade, 11 Mar (TANJUG)--The European Union (EU) 
remains active in the peace process in the former Yugoslavia, 
Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias stressed upon his 
arrival in Belgrade today. 
  In his statement to reporters at Surcin airport, Papoulias 
said the Bosnian crisis would be the first problem to be 
discussed at an informal EU meeting on 26 and 27 March. 
  He did not specify whether he brought any proposals to 
Belgrade, but said: "I am here to make a contribution to the 
peace process in the capacity of the chairman of the European 
Council, but also as foreign minister of Greece, which is 
directly interested in the Balkan problem." 
  Asked what was happening with the EU proposal after the 
Washington agreement had been signed, Papoulias did not give a 
direct answer, but replied that the latest EU activities had 
been discussed at the latest session of the EU Council of 
Ministers. 
  "I would like to convince you that the EU will be actively 
present in the upcoming developments," he said. Asked whether 
the EU was upset about the United States having monopolized the 
issue, Papoulias said "we are not upset, but in any case, we 
want to remain present at the scene, together with powers such 
as the United States and Russia." 
  According to him, nobody "must forget the EU's contribution 
so far and the ideas of the EU's program of activities, which 
remain the most significant ideas at present," he stressed. 
  Asked about possible deployment of Turkish troops in Bosnia, 
Papoulias said that all Balkan countries were interested in the 
problem, since they had said in the past that no forces from any 
of the Balkan countries must be sent into former Yugoslavia. 
  Papoulias said if Turkey sends its units, Greece would also 
consider sending its forces.

  [Excerpts] Belgrade, 10 Mar (TANJUG)--At its session today 
presided over by Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kontic the 
federal government examined a report on spring sowing and 
adopted a decision on protected prices of basic agricultural 
products, the Federal Ministry of Information announced in a 
statement. [passage omitted] 
  The government also examined and endorsed a letter which the 
federal prime minister is to send to UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali regarding the extension of the UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] mandate in the protected zones on the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia. It has been concluded that 
the presence of the UN peace forces in the protected zones is an 
important factor for the creation of the necessary conditions 
for reaching a political solution to the problem. 
  The government was also informed about actions taken by the 
Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs in connection with a 
decision of the German authorities to expel FRY [Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia] citizens whose status in Germany has not 
been legalized. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been tasked 
with continuing and intensifying contacts with the relevant 
German authorities so that the full protection of the rights and 
interests of all FRY citizens in Germany may be secured, with 
particular insistence on the full application of the current 
international conventions and practice, the statement says. 
[passage omitted] 
  Milenko Perovic, hitherto the Montenegrin president's 
secretary general, has been appointed chairman of the Federal 
Council of Magistrates. 
  New Deputy Prime Minister Uros Klikovac has been appointed 
chairman of the Federal Commission for the Political and Legal 
System, the Federal Ministry of Information statement concludes.

  [Text] Zagreb, March 10 (TANJUG)--The United States plan 
for the creation of a Moslem-Croat federation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and its subsequent confederation with the 
Republic of Croatia is meeting with growing criticism and 
concern in Zagreb. 
  Not only the opposition, but also newspapers close to the 
ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), whose leader is Croatian 
President Franjo Tudjman, have been warning that the negative 
consequences of the Croat-Moslem "state marriage" could surface 
very soon. 
  The opposition in Croatia, which had strongly urged an 
agreement with the Moslems, now sets out that Zagreb has taken a 
rash political turn. It insists that there is no need for 
rushing into a confederation, above all because both Croatia and 
the future Moslem-Croat federation must first secure "integral 
internationally-recognized borders." 
  Commenting on the preliminary Moslem-Croat agreement signed 
in Washington last week under pressure from the United States, 
Croatian media say that everything has a "taste of punishment 
for both sides." 
  Several scores of thousands of Croatia's regular army troops 
have for over a year been aiding the Bosnian Croats in their 
battle against the Bosnian Moslems. 
  The weekly DANAS, close to the ruling HDZ, said in its 
latest 
issue that, under the Washington agreement, the central 
authorities in Sarajevo (which would be Moslem-dominated because 
Moslems are numerically stronger) would hold all vital 
departments, from the foreign affairs, national defence, 
economic policy, finance, to energy. 
  Croatian demographers set out that Croats would acount for 
4.5 million, or roughly 60 percent, of the confederation's 7.5 
million inhabitants, but that they would be faced with an 
"above-average birth rate of the Moslem population". 
  "The high birth rate, coupled with the settling of Moslems 
in 
Croatia, could very soon turn the Croats into a minority," 
demographers set out. 
  Moslems, as head of the Croatian state statistics bureau 
Jakov Gelo, himself, has said, "will spread not only on the 
territory of the federation, but also on that of the 
confederation, i.e. Croatia," and will have difficulty "fitting 
in with the Croats because of different religion, culture and 
customs." 
  Gelo said that the hitherto experiences had shown that, 
using 
the same criteria, "Croats and Serbs were more alike than Croats 
and Moslems".

  [Text] Belgrade, March 10 (TANJUG)--Leader of the Serbian 
Radical Party Dr Vojislav Seselj said on Thursday the Washington 
agreement on a Moslem-Croat federation had given the Serbs the 
most favourable opportunity to unify all their territories. 
  The Serbian Radical Party is the second-strongest opposition 
party in the Serbian Parliament. 
  "If Jamahiriya (Seselj's term for the Bosnian Moslem state) 
and the Bosnian-Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna can subsequently 
enter a confederation with Croatia, who can prevent the Bosnian 
Serb Republic to join Yugoslavia," Seselj underscored at a press 
conference. According to him, Serb politicians should use this 
opportunity in the best possible way. 
  He added, however, that the Belgrade authorities had voiced 
their restraint on the issue and lacked courage to make a more 
resolved move in their foreign policy. He urged that the 
Bosnian Serb Republic and the Republic of Serb Krajina should 
merge, and consequently have one government, prime minister and 
parliament. 
  Asked about Germany's decision to expel nationals of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, mainly ethnic Albanians from 
Serbia's province of Kosovo/Metohija, Seselj said it was a way 
of putting pressure on Belgrade. He added that this problem 
could be solved at the border. 
  His solution for the problem was to deny entrance to 
Yugoslavia to all Albanians who had illegaly come to 
Kosovo/Metohija in 1948 and later, and who had not acquired 
Yugoslav citizenship. As for ethnic Albanians who had refused 
to serve their military term with the Yugoslav Army and had, 
therefore, escaped to Germany, they should immediately be 
arrested.

  [Text] The 50th Session of the UN Human Rights Commission 
held in Geneva has approved two resolutions on Kosova, initiated 
by the United States and Pakistan. These resolutions condemn the 
brutality, acts, and violence of the Serbian regime against the 
Albanians of Kosova. 
  Welcoming the approval of these two resolutions, the 
government of the republic of Kosova has issued a public 
communique stressing that Belgrade has been shown to be 
responsible for violating the basic freedoms and rights of the 
Albanian people. Thus, the UN resolutions express the will of 
the civilized peoples in the world to object to every violation 
of human rights in Kosova and undertake actions in this regard. 
  The government of the republic of Kosova is of the opinion 
that the will expressed by its people is the only basis for a 
final solution. The communique asks the UN to increase its 
efforts to be present in Kosova to help prevent conflict and 
guarantee the return of democratic institutions to normality.

  [Text] The Press Center of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 
reports that Army General Rasim Delic and Brigadier-General 
Jovan Divjak held talks with General John Galvin, special 
military envoy of U.S. President Clinton, in Sarajevo today. 
  The discussion concerned further steps in the implementation 
of the agreement between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the 
Croatian Defense Council [HVO], which will be taken in the 
coming days. During the talks, General Delic informed General 
Galvin of the possible principles of a military solution in the 
future Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, which separately outlines 
possible solutions for the transitional period. 
  At the end of today's talks General Galvin expressed 
optimism 
about the future course of the talks, absolutely acknowledging 
all the difficulties that are possible in the course of the 
realization of the agreement, especially in the transitional 
period. 
  The talks of the representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army and the HVO about a military solution in the future 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation are scheduled to commence tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Lovrenovic on statements of Herceg-Bosna </F>
officials in Mostar; date not given: "Federation Simultaneous 
With Confederacy"] 
  [Text] Kresimir Zubak, president of the presidential 
council, said about the Washington agreement that "all the 
positions contained in the Washington documents were supported 
by the presidential council and the party leadership, and during 
the talks in Vienna we will try to include what was emphasized 
at the session in Mostar. My personal opinion is that the 
preliminary agreement on the future Bosnia-Herzegovina 
federation anticipates a much looser union than the former 
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. However, details and 
the final assessment will only be available after the final 
proposal for the constitutional documents is put together in 
Vienna." 
  Ivan Bender, president of the chamber of representatives of 
the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, said that "the Croat people 
consider these documents and everything they imply to be one of 
the possible solutions in the many possible events we may 
encounter in the upcoming period. Our negotiating team must get 
expert reinforcement, especially now that all the details of the 
future union are the issue, to make all the solutions as close 
to our positions as possible. This agreement on federation can 
only be concluded if the confederacy between the Republic of 
Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina is established simultaneously." 
  "After the document drafts are coordinated, the chamber of 
representatives will discuss them and give its opinion before 
the possible referendum. Our declaration, made at the session 
in Livno, is a valid document, and our negotiators bear that in 
mind. The preliminary agreement contains certain differences in 
relation to the documents passed at the chamber of 
representatives, but we will discuss everything after the work 
with the negotiations is completed," added Bender. 
  Pero Markovic, president of the Executive Committee of the 
Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] for Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
believes that "not all the Croats of Bosnia-Herzegovina are in 
the same position with regard to where they come from. In that 
respect, they supported various solutions, which had to be put 
into a single solution. This is why we support our negotiating 
team and the expert groups in everything they have done so far. 
At this meeting, Croat unity was expressed, and there were no 
separate positions regarding the agreement and general politics. 
The HDZ has not changed its policies. The HDZ of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has not given up on the ethnic principle that 
it incorporated in the Cutilheiro, Vance-Owen, Owen-Stoltenberg, 
and all other plans," said Markovic.

  [Excerpts] Zagreb, March 10 (AFP)--Bosnian Croats said 
Thursday they would not accept a federation with Moslems in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina which was not linked to a confederation with 
Croatia proper. [passage omitted] 
  The statement was issued here after the presidential council 
of the republic of Hereg-Bosna met in Mostar, southern Bosnia 
[location as received]. 
  The council has 11 members and is chaired by Kresimir Zubak, 
who has also headed the Bosnian Croat delegation in Vienna at 
talks on the proposed Moslem-Croat federation, brokered in 
Washington last week. 
  The council expressed its "full support" for its delegation 
in Vienna, but said that it had an "obligation to coordinate 
daily with the members of the presidential council who are not 
part of the delegation." 
  The report came after Zagreb's deputy foreign minister Ivo 
Sanader said that the talks in Vienna could be concluded Friday 
with leaders from both sides flying in to work out the final 
details. 
  Further discussions would be needed on the "demarcation of 
the Croat and Moslem cantons" in the future federation. [passage 
omitted] 
  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said on Monday that the 
question of a confederation would be put to a referendum in the 
republic, but added that the issue could not be settled "so long 
as the question of Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina remains 
unresolved."

  [Text] Representatives of the Serbian Consultative 
Council, the Council of the Congress of Bosnian-Muslim 
Intellectuals, and the Croatian Coordinating Committee held a 
joint meeting today at which they examined the general agreement 
on the establishment of a federation and the general agreement 
on confederation with Croatia. 
  The joint stance of the Serbian Consultative Council, the 
Council of the Congress of the Bosnian-Muslim Intellectuals, and 
the Croatian Coordinating Committee, is that the sovereignty of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina as a state over its entire territory, peace, 
and human rights for all its citizens and peoples must be 
secured in the future documents, and this appears in a statement 
from today's meeting. 
  At the meeting they expressed their full support for the 
initiative to call an assembly of the citizens of Serbian 
nationality and Serbian ethnic origin, as was initiated by the 
Serbian Consultative Council, the statement reads.

  In his statement Mr. Sanader voiced numerous imprecisions 
and 
inaccuracies about the work of the transitional committee. In 
this way he, among other things, mentioned the existence of 
Croatian and Bosniak cantons and said that Mostar would be the 
capital of the community of the Croatian cantons. 
  The concept of the constitution of the proposed federation, 
whose bases have been established by the Washington agreement, 
does not envisage ethnic cantons. This constitution does not 
envisage any other form of state organization beside a 
federation, cantons, and communes. Therefore, Trnka emphasizes, 
there was never any talk of any capitals of any community of 
cantons. The arbitrary statement by Mr. Sanader that Mostar 
will be the capital of such a community is completely inaccurate 
and bears no relation whatsoever to the Vienna talks. 
  Such statements, as well as certain other steps, do not 
contribute toward the strengthening of mutual trust or the peace 
process as a whole. 
  The Croatian delegation and the U.S. mediators had all these 
imprecisions and inaccuracies pointed out to them, after which 
Mr. Sanader personally asked me to accept his apologies, reads 
the statement for the public by Kasim Trnka, head of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation in Vienna talks.

  [Text] The [Serbian] aggressor this evening resumed his 
fierce attacks on Maglaj. The town has been under attack from 
surface-to-surface missiles of horrendous destructive power 
since 1800. Seven such missiles have been fired exclusively at 
residential and civilian buildings so far. The destruction of 
Maglaj in this fashion continues even as we are sending this 
dispatch, and it is 1850 hours now. A horrible evening in 
Maglaj!

  [Excerpts] Zepce, Bosnia-Herzegovina, March 10 (AFP)--Serb 
forces blocked Thursday a UN aid convoy to the besieged Moslem 
enclave of Maglaj but UN troops said the impasse would be 
resolved soon. [passage omitted] 
  The commander of a 150-man Company C Light Dragoons 
reconnaissance unit said Serb forces had Wednesday asked convoy 
leaders to sign "a disclaimer saying they would take 
responsibility" for the aid trucks and personnel if they entered 
the Maglaj area. The disclaimer meant that Serb troops would not 
be responsible if something happened to the aid workers. The 
commander, who spoke to AFP on condition that he not be named, 
said the UNHCR officials refused to do this. 
  He confirmed reports of recent fighting in the area and said 
that he had himself heard from Zepce the sounds of up to 10 
shells a minute falling on Maglaj which has been under a Serb 
siege since June. This matches reports from the mainly Moslem 
government's Radio Sarajevo which has spoken of days over the 
past two weeks when up to 4,000 shells fell on Maglaj. 
  Several UNHCR convoys have been kept from reaching Maglaj. 
The one blocked Thursday left Banja Luka in northwest Bosnia 
last week and has been stopped at Teslic for several days. 
[passage omitted] 
  Maglaj has not received humanitarian aid by land since last 
October. It depends on NATO airdrops of food but UNHCR 
officials have said the situation there is desperate. UNHCR 
director for Bosnia Larry Hollingworth was Thursday north of 
Zepce trying to arrange for the convoy, Croatian military 
commander for the region Niko Jozinovic told AFP. He did not 
say exactly what Hollingworth was doing. UN officials said 
requests had been made to Bosnian Serb military leader General 
Ratko Mladic in Pale, near Sarajevo in central Bosnia, to give 
the convoy authorization for Maglaj. Jozinovic said his HVO 
forces, which have positions between Zepce and Maglaj, were not 
involved in the fighting. He said, however, that Serb troops 
did pass through territory held by the HVO. "It is necessary to 
put pressure on the Serb side to end this war," Jozinovic said. 
He said the Moslem-Croat ceasefire in effect in central and 
southern Bosnia was holding for the Maglaj area as well. "In the 
next 20 days, this war will stop," Jozinovic said through an 
interpreter. 
  Elsewhere in northern Bosnia, mine-clearing operations by 
UNPROFOR continued at the Tuzla airbase to prepare it for 
international aid flights. The 2,400 metre (3,000 yard) runway 
was also being swept while Bosnian workers dismantled runway 
lighting. 
  Wednesday night was extremely calm, a spokesman for 
UNPROFOR's Nordic battalion said, following the firing of three 
mortar bombs on the town of Tuzla by besieging Serb forces which 
killed a man and his young son. Another UNPROFOR officer said 
there had been sounds of shellfire and automatic weapons from 
the mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army lines some eight kilometres (five 
miles) away. 
  In Zagreb UNPROFOR spokesman Michael Williams said no date 
had yet been fixed for opening the airfield, closed since the 
beginning of the war nearly two years ago, under an agreement 
concluded with the Bosnian Serbs. "We still have no definite 
date," said Williams. "There are still questions about possible 
presence of liaison officers on the airport, from the Serbian 
side and the Bosnian side." 
  On Wednesday UNPROFOR's military spokesman, Lieutenant 
Colonel Jean Marcotte, said the UN would like to start aid 
flights within a week, though new equipment for the airport to 
operate them would have to be flown in first. "Requests for 
equipment assistance have already gone out. We are pleased with 
the response that we've met to that," Williams said.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 11 (AFP)--The UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR) is readying two aid convoys for Bosnia's 
besieged Maglaj region which has been cut off for nine months by 
Serb forces, UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler said Friday. 
  The Bosnian Serbs Thursday again prevented one 10-truck 
convoy carrying 92 tons of food from entering the northern town, 
forcing the UNHCR to divert it to Zenica, in central Bosnia. 
  Kessler said the UNHCR's head of operations in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Larry Hollingworth, who accompanied the 
convoy, was splitting it into two, one for Maglaj itself and one 
for the town of Tesanj, 15 kilometres (10 miles) west. 
  The two towns are in the Maglaj pocket, containing some 
130,000 people who have been under siege by the Serbs since last 
June. They are only supplied by international air drops and 
latest reports speak of desperate conditions in the area.

  [Text] Zepce, Bosnia-Herzegovina, March 10 (AFP)--Bosnian 
Serb forces blocked Thursday [10 March] a UN aid convoy to the 
besieged Moslem enclave of Maglaj but UN troops only a few 
kilometres (miles) away said the impasse would be resolved soon. 
  The British commander of a UN forward base in Zepce said the 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) convoy was blocked in 
Teslic, only a few kilometres west of the Maglaj pocket where 
some 16,000 Moslems in Maglaj itself and over 100,000 people in 
the region are under a fierce Serb attack. 
  Maglaj, where UNHCR officials have described the situation 
as 
desperate, has received no humanitarian aid by road since last 
October, and is entirely dependent on NATO food airdrops. The 
commander of a 150-strong Light Dragoons reconnaissance unit 
said Serb forces had Wednesday asked convoy leaders to sign "a 
disclaimer saying they would take responsibility" for the aid 
trucks and personnel if they entered the Maglaj area. He said 
the UNHCR officials had refused to do this. 
  The convoy left Banja Luka in northwest Bosnia last week and 
has been blocked at Teslic for several days. Several UNHCR 
convoys have been kept from reaching Maglaj, in northern Bosnia, 
aid officials said. The commander spoke to AFP on condition that 
he not be named. The Dragoons, who arrived 10 days ago, were 
still filling in sandbags and working on positions at the 
abandoned factory where they are installed. The commander said 
the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) of which the British soldiers 
are a part had several options available to ensure that the 
convoy enters Maglaj "in a very, very short period of time." He 
said these included the Serbs agreeing to let it pass, Croat 
militia in the area helping it pass or for UNPROFOR to act on 
its own.

  [Excerpts] According to a communique of the Croatian 
Defense Council, there have been no violations of the cease-fire 
between the Croatian Defense Council and the Muslim army. 
Zdenko Vranjes, reporting for Croatian Radio: 
  [Passage omitted] Examining the implementation of the 
Muslim-Croat political and military agreements, the Presidential 
Council of the Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna reached the 
conclusion at its session today that the Croatian Defense 
Council had fully complied with the obligations from the 
cease-fire agreement and confirmed its permanent orientation to 
the cessation of hostilities. The Council said that the 
exchange of prisoners was a fundamental precondition for the 
continuation of the implementation of the agreement and the 
restoration of trust. 
  The Presidential Council reiterated that the Croat people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina would enter the setting-up and the 
establishment of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, but only 
with the simultaneous setting-up and establishment of a 
confederation between the Republic of Croatia and the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. 
  Lending its full support to a delegation of the Croat people 
at the Vienna negotiations led by [Council President] Kresimir 
Zubak, the Presidential Council at the same time stressed that 
the delegation was duty-bound to coordinate its views daily with 
other members of the Council who are not attending the 
negotiations. In negotiations, it is necessary to secure and 
emphasize the inherent sovereignty of the Croat grand counties 
with the precisely set out procedure for the realization of the 
right to self-determination, conclusions from the session say.

<F P=106> [Interview with RSK Foreign Minister Slobodan Jarcevic by </F>
news announcer in the Belgrade Radio studio on 10 March--live] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Mr. Jarcevic, could you briefly give us 
your comments on the latest attacks by Croatia? 
  [Jarcevic] Croatia is not attacking the Serbian positions in 
the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK], but has carried out 
aggression on the territory of the Korenica commune. Supported 
with artillery and tanks, Croatian soldiers have stormed that 
territory. Moreover, in northwestern Dalmatia, they are 
attacking the communes of Obrovac and Benkovac. 
  In the eastern part of the republic of Serbian Krajina, 
around Vinkovci, they are also attacking us with artillery and 
infantry weapons. This is only a prelude, and I am expecting 
all-out war between the Republic of Croatia and the republic of 
Serbian Krajina. 
  [Announcer] On what do you base your views? 
  [Jarcevic] General Tudjman was given support in all the 
international bodies, in the United Nations, the CSCE, and the 
European Union. Washington is now firmly supporting him in his 
calls for the reintegration of the republic of Serbian Krajina 
into the Republic of Croatia. He knows that he cannot 
accomplish this with the agreement of the Serbian people who 
live in the republic of Serbian Krajina or those Serbs whom he 
has expelled from the Republic of Croatia. He is only left with 
war and it is certain that in the secret connections with 
Western countries he has been given the green light for that. 
  [Announcer] Thank you.

  [Text] Vienna, March 11 (AFP)--Negotiations on forming a 
federation of Bosnian Moslems and Croats look set to stretch 
into next week, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said 
Friday after meeting with Austrian President Thomas Klestil. 
  "They will not end today," the premier said, adding that he 
expected to spend the whole of the weekend in Vienna. "I do not 
think we are in any hurry," he said. "We have to pay attention 
to each detail. It is serious work." 
  The US-sponsored talks were scheduled to work out the 
details 
of an agreement reached earlier this month in Washington to set 
up a Croat-Moslem federation in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
  The talks were complicated by a decision by Bosnian Croat 
leaders inside Bosnia on Wednesday to insist that the 
Moslem-Croat entity be formally linked in a confederation with 
neighbouring Croatia. 
  Silajdzic said he had talks scheduled for Friday evening 
with 
Croatia's Foreign Minister Mate Granic. 
  He said Serbs would be invited to take part in a joint 
effort 
to find a negotiated settlement to continued fighting between 
their forces and the Moslem-led Bosnian army, even though the 
Serbs have so far refused. 
  "Certain relations with the Serbs of Serbia and the Serbs of 
Bosnia will have to be discussed," he said. 
  Silajdzic noted that Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
had assured him during a meeting earlier this week in Moscow 
that Russia would do its best to bring the Serbs into a 
negotiated final solution. 
  There was a chance of reaching agreement in Vienna if there 
is "enough goodwill and if our friends, in particular the United 
States, maintain their current commitment," Silajdzic said.

<F P=106> [Article by Alfred Schwarz on interview with Bosnian Prime </F>
Minister Haris Silajdzic in Vienna on 11 March--recorded; 
Silajdzic's statements in English] 
  [Text] [Schwarz] What has not been accomplished by the 
three parties so far is now to be accomplished by two--finding a 
peace solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since last week, Muslims 
and Croats have been together in Vienna to unite their two 
so-far hostile ethnic groups in one state. For this purpose, 
many issues must be clarified--the constitution, the division of 
the territory into cantons, and, not least, the problem of the 
overall territory. And here, the circle closes with the so-far 
unsuccessful negotiations of all three ethnic groups--Muslims, 
Croats, and Serbs. 
  The Serbs are currently occupying about 70 percent of the 
Bosnian territory. A state of Muslims and Croats with only 30 
percent of the territory seems to be impossible. Thus, the Serbs 
would have to give up territory that they have conquered. 
However, they are not part of the negotiations in Vienna. 
  This defect is also seen by Bosnian Prime Minister 
Silajdzic. 
Since the Serbs are not willing to participate in the 
negotiations in Vienna, one now has to discuss the possibility 
of a Muslim-Croat state. 
  [Silajdzic] They will be invited to join this common effort 
of the Bosniaks and the Croats. For the time being, their 
statements show that they are not willing to do that. In that 
case, we can talk about a possibility of creating a political 
entity with a status, of course, within the international body 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Schwarz] However, even if a Muslim-Croat state in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is established without the Serbs, this will 
be a weak state. Therefore, a loose union with Croatia is 
envisaged. There are even voices from Zagreb that want to make 
this one of the basic preconditions for the negotiations in 
Vienna. 
  Prime Minister Silajdzic does not think anything of that. 
The 
new state will be a strong state, he says, and both Croatia and 
the new Muslim-Croat federation will be separate, sovereign, and 
independent states. 
  [Silajdzic] Well, of course, it will be even a stronger 
country. The two countries will retain their identity, their 
independence, their sovereignty. 
  [Schwarz] With consideration for the negotiations that are 
still underway, the Bosnian head of government was not able to 
say anything more specific about the planned Muslim-Croat state. 
However, there are continued efforts to include the Serbs in the 
planned solution in some way. Therefore, Silajdzic visited 
Serbia's protector, Russia, in Moscow yesterday. And he 
believes that Moscow will still play a positive role in the 
negotiations. 
  [Silajdzic] Yesterday, I came from Moscow, and Mr. Kozyrev 
assured me that Russia will do its best to play a constructive 
role in seeking the final negotiating settlement. 
  [Schwarz] One thing is clear in any case. The negotiations 
are now entering their decisive stage. This is also indicated 
by the fact that, this afternoon, Croatian Foreign Minister 
Granic will also come to the negotiations in Vienna. 
Nevertheless, Muslim Prime Minister Silajdzic does not expect a 
speedy conclusion. One is not in such a hurry, it will still 
take some time until peace will reign in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he 
said.

  [Excerpt] Under U.S. auspices, the Bosnian-Croatian 
transitional committee in Vienna is today working with the same 
intensity on the specification of details of the implementation 
of the preliminary Washington agreement. The entire constitution 
of the federation of the Croats and the Muslims, as a community 
of originally sovereign peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina, has been 
more or less completed. In this way a foundation stone has been 
laid for the restoration of peace in the Balkans. However, this 
will also depend on the behavior of Karadzic's Serbs, who are 
supposed to return a third of the conquered Bosnian territories. 
The Russian influence on the Serbian side will be crucial in all 
this. For the time being, though, there have been no encouraging 
signals from Belgrade yet, the Austrian media and political 
observers assess. 
  The expert Croatian-Bosniak commission is supposed to 
continue preparations until 17 March--as requested by the 
Bosnian side because of Ramadan--on all the relevant documents 
for the final agreement. 
  Charles Redman, special envoy of U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, 
arrived in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna this afternoon to take 
part in the continuation of the Croatian-Bosniak talks.

  [Text] Geneva, March 9 (TANJUG)--Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) [FRY--Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] was on 
Wednesday again unjustly accused of violating the human rights 
of ethnic Albanians in Serbia's southern province of 
Kosovo-Metohija. 
  The U.N. Human Rights Commission has adopted a special 
resolution alleging, in the absence of any valid explanation and 
evidence, that the Albanian minority in Kosovo-Metohija is being 
subjected to a brutal policy, summary arrests and even mass 
executions. 
  However, Yugoslav authorities deny the truth of this, 
insisting that there have never been any mass executions of 
ethnic Albanians in the province, and that only those ethnic 
Albanians have been arrested who have been actively involved in 
the movement to detach Kosovo-Metohija from Serbia and 
Yugoslavia. 
  In combating the separatist movement, Yugoslav authorities 
have acted in strict accordance with the law and have taken no 
action that would not have been taken by any other state in 
similar circumstances. 
  A strong separatist movement has been active in 
Kosovo-Metohija for decades, striving for the province's violent 
secession from Yugoslavia and annexation to neighbouring Albania. 
  The Russian representative to the U.N. Human Rights 
Commission moved that the resolution should not be put to the 
vote, explaining that individual positions included in the 
resolution had been incorporated, albeit in a milder form, in an 
already adopted omnibus resolution on former Yugoslavia. 
  The motion was supported by most Western countries, except 
Germany and some Nordic states, but the resolution was 
nevertheless voted in place, having been upheld by the Moslem 
countries which make up an overwhelming majority in the 
commission. 
  Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo-Metohija are Moslems, and 
neighbouring Albania is a member of the Organization of the 
Islamic Conference.

  [Text] New York, March 11 (TANJUG)--The U.N. Security 
Council on Thursday called on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
to return to Bulgaria the convoy of barges, crew, and cargo 
(6,000 tonnes of oil are claimed to be in question) which 
arrived in the Serbian port of Prahovo on the Danube last 
weekend. 
  News agencies have reported that the Bulgarian barges were 
hijacked by armed men and forced to go to Prahovo. 
  The Security Council has prepared a statement in which it 
condemns what it calls an extremely dangerous act, but says that 
it is yet to be determined who was responsible for it. The 
council has, however, decided not to adopt the statement but 
instead to call on Yugoslavia to return the barges, crew and 
cargo. 
  In a letter to the Security Council and later in a meeting 
with council president Jean-Bernard Merimee, Yugoslav Ambassador 
to the U.N. Dragomir Djokic stressed that Yugoslavia did not 
know of any hijacking and that the convoy of barges had normally 
arrived in Prahovo and undergone a routine check there. 
  Djokic said that Bulgaria had informed Yugoslavia only after 
over 24 hours that the Han Kubrat tugboat had been hijacked and 
that Yugoslavia immediately took the necessary steps and opened 
an investigation. 
  Djokic said that there were not only 21 crew members on 
board 
the tugboat, but also seven passengers, of whom five with 
Bulgarian passports which were in order, while two passengers 
had to be detained because their papers were not in order. 
  Djokic has said that Merimee thanked the Yugoslav Government 
for the information it had provided so far and the assistance it 
had offered in the clearing up of the case, but set out that the 
Security Council expected Yugoslavia to return the barges, crew 
and cargo to Bulgaria by the beginning of next week.

The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], had lengthy 
talks in Geneva today with Cyrus Vance, the UN mediator in the 
FYROM-Greek dispute. 
  Minister Crvenkovski has made a special statement for Skopje 
Radio from Geneva saying that Vance has been informed about all 
the aspects of problems created in the wake of the imposition of 
the Greek embargo, and that there was still a great deal to be 
discussed. The FYROM side stresses that it was difficult to 
conduct a dialogue under the pressure of the blockade and that 
it was necessary first to lift the embargo before the dialogue 
with Greece could be resumed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias met with UN 
mediator Cyrus Vance at 1400 today in Geneva and discussed the 
Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue. 
Mr. Papoulias presented to the international mediator the Greek 
proposals on the flag and constitution of Skopje and explained 
the reasons why the Greek Government decided to impose the trade 
embargo on this statelet. 
  According to reports from Geneva, after his meeting with 
Karolos Papoulias within the framework of efforts to settle the 
Greece-Skopje dispute, Cyrus Vance will also meet with Skopjean 
Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski. It has been learned from 
Cyrus Vance's circles that no meeting between the Greek and 
Skopjean foreign ministers has been scheduled. 
  Mr. Papoulias is expected in Belgrade this evening. He will 
meet with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic at 1100 tomorrow, 
and after their talks he will leave immediately for Moscow. 
  According to an ASSOCIATED PRESS dispatch received from 
Geneva a short time ago, UN envoy Cyrus Vance proposed to 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias some ideas to settle the 
dispute with Skopje, but the obstacles remain. Mr. Papoulias 
said that the trade embargo that Greece has imposed on the 
neighboring country will continue until an overall solution is 
found. The Greek foreign minister added that he will examine new 
proposals together with Mr. Vance when they meet again. Mr. 
Vance said that he hopes this new meeting will be held in two 
weeks. Mr. Papoulias said that in the meantime the Greek 
representatives will meet with Mr. Vance's aides as part of the 
efforts to solve the problem. After his two-hour talks with Mr. 
Papoulias, Mr. Vance told reporters that there is room for more 
negotiations.

  [Excerpts] Brussels--Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus is 
at this very moment signing the Partnership for Peace project, 
which offers postcommunist countries cooperation in security and 
political issues. The Czech Republic has become the 11th country 
to join the project. [passage omitted] 
  Klaus said in his speech that the Czech Republic regards the 
Partnership for Peace as a brave initiative that means a new 
stage in our relations with NATO, the military and political 
organization of 16 countries that we are striving to join. 
  As far as our admission into the European Union is 
concerned, 
Klaus was, in his own words, very optimistic following his talks 
with the EU Commission President Jacques Delors, in particular 
when he said that the end or the turn of the century was too 
late for us as a date for our admission as a fully fledged 
member. The Czech prime minister shocked the Hungarians and the 
Poles, in particular, with this statement. They are expecting 
to be admitted to the alliance at the turn of the century. 
  Neither Delors nor Klaus regard it as decisive when a 
country 
submits an application for full membership in the Twelve. What 
is more important is when they meet the specific qualitative 
criteria for membership set by the Maastricht Treaty. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MSZ] has instructed 
the Polish delegate of the UN Human Rights Commission to abstain 
from voting on the resolution condemning transgressions of human 
and civil rights in China. Sladyslaw Klaczynski, the director 
of the MSZ press department, explained that Poland did not 
condemn the transgression of human rights in China since it is 
difficult to conscientiously judge the situation by virtue of 
the distance between our countries. Director Jan Woroniecki of 
the UN department [of the MSZ] informed us that the MSZ had 
instructed the Human Rights Commission's Polish delegate to 
abstain from voting after consultations with the government. 
  In turn, Justice Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz stated 
that 
the stance of the MSZ on this matter is not the stance of the 
government, but merely an internal instruction of the MSZ, one 
with which he is not familiar. The Democratic Union and the 
Liberal Democratic Congress have expressed indignation on 
account of the nongranting by Poland of support for the UN 
resolution on the transgression of human rights in China. Union 
of Labor Deputy Aleksander Malachowski said that this decision 
is an example of the victory of trade and economic interests 
over a feeling of responsibility for adherence to elementary 
civil rights. 
  Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the special delegate of the UN Human 
Rights Commission in the former Yugoslavia, said that the 
sacrifice of higher criteria, as he termed the protection of 
human rights, for other political criteria threatens the state 
with a loss of respect in the world. On the other hand, in the 
view of Krzysztof Krol of the Confederation for Independent 
Poland, the decision of the Polish Government on the issue of 
the voting was correct and witnesses to the independence of 
Polish foreign policy.

  [Text] The Democratic Party [PD-FSN] is following with 
concern recent developments in the political and socioeconomic 
activity in the Republic of Moldova, a communique received from 
the PD-FSN Executive Bureau emphasizes. As an observer at the 
recent elections in the Republic of Moldova, the PD-FSN believes 
that the opposition parties have been systematically hampered in 
addressing the electorate, while the ruling party, with the 
support of the presidency, benefited from unlimited access to 
the television station. 
  The communique points out that the organization, a week 
after 
the election and during the absence of observers, of the 
sociological poll entitled Consulting the People, is viewed as 
something futile and the possible transformation of the poll 
into a referendum on the basis of a presidential decree is 
inacceptable.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 10 March carries a 
series of reports on the combat situation in the republic: 
  A dispatch from the 7th South Operative Group says: "After a 
peaceful morning, fierce enemy attacks have resumed on the 
defense lines in the operational zone of the 7th South Operative 
Group. After fierce artillery attacks, the chetniks have been 
attempting infantry breakthroughs in the Bandera-[word 
indistinct] region. The Doboj defenders are successfully 
resisting these attacks, which are still going on." 
  Hajrudin Fermic reports from the Maglaj front that "after 
last night's massacre in the old part of Maglaj, when five 
civilians were killed and 13 injured, the chetniks are today 
trying to repeat this by suddenly shelling the town and by 
sniper fire (?in the north). Tanks, Bofors guns, and mortars 
have been used to attack at various intervals from the western 
and southern side. We have learned in the emergency ward that 
one person was wounded by a sniper today. The chetniks are also 
continuing their rapid concentration of manpower and deployment 
of armored vehicles and artillery." However, he adds, "the 
fighters of the 201th Brigade and their affiliated units stand 
ready to resist the offensive." 
  Muhamed Mujic reports from Bihac that "the fierce 
Serbo-chetnik offensive continues today in the free part of the 
Bihac area. In addition to the defense lines of the 5th Corps 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Croatian Defense Council, 
the regions of Bihac and Cazin have been targeted by all kinds 
of artillery and tanks. The most destructive grenades have 
today been falling on Bihac, especially on its industrial zone 
and suburbs. The chetniks showed their insolence and truly 
desperate motives with a frontal tank assault on the base of the 
French battalion in the center of Bihac last night. At 2140 
[2040 GMT], tanks from the notorious aggressor's stronghold in 
Grabez suddenly opened fire on the French Battalion's base, 
which is clearly marked and has been there for over a year. 
Several shells hit the building in which the French soldiers 
are accommodated and one grenade landed in [word indistinct] 
where the vehicles are parked. One truck was completely 
destroyed in the powerful explosion while several vehicles have 
been damaged. Luckily, according to unofficial reports, none of 
the French soldiers was injured." Mujic adds here that "many 
people in Bihac wonder why NATO aircraft were not called in to 
help."

  [Text] Vienna, March 10 (AFP)--Talks on a proposed 
Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia could be concluded here Friday 
[11 March] with leaders from both sides flying in to work out 
the final details, the head of the Croat delegation said 
Thursday. 
  Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, in Vienna Thursday, 
is to participate Friday "for the final phase, if the talks end 
then," Bosnian justice minister Kasim Trnka said. 
  The head of the Croatian delegation, Zagreb's deputy foreign 
minister Ivo Sanader, said further discussions were needed on 
the "demarcation of the Croat and Moslem cantons" in the future 
federation. 
  The Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic might also 
participate in the talks Friday, Trnka said. 
  U.S. special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, Charles Redman, 
returned to Vienna, following trips to Belgrade, Zagreb and 
Sarajevo earlier this week in an unsuccessful effort to convince 
the Serbs to join the federation plan and end more than two 
years of bloodshed. 
  There was "still a lot of work to do" on the federation 
before negotations were completed, he said. 
  The talks are focusing on a U.S.-brokered federation plan 
signed last week in Washington. It calls for Bosnia's Moslem 
and Croats to join their territories under a loose federation 
that could eventually be linked with Croatia. 
  Thursday's session was focussing on the number and 
delineation of cantons in the future federation, according to a 
Bosnian official. 
  "There could be three Croat cantons and four Moslem 
cantons," 
he said. 
  The talks were also to cover the organisation of Bosnian and 
Croatian forces, until recently engaged in bitter fighting in 
central Bosnia, and the federation's political structures. 
  In Zagreb, the Croat news agency Hina said U.S. General John 
Galvin, the former head of allied forces in Europe, flew in from 
Sarajevo to the southern Croatian city of Split Thursday to 
prepare a meeting the following day between Bosnia's Moslem and 
Croat military leaders, Generals Rasim Delic and Ante Roso. 
  The Friday talks, expected to be also attended by U.S. 
General Larry Smith from NATO's Naples base, are to focus on the 
military aspects of the Vienna talks, including a joint command.

<F P=106> [Article by M.U.: "Walesa: I Must Check the Budget"; last </F>
paragraph unattributed] 
  [Text] Asked whether he will sign the budget, President 
Walesa said that he must first check it. "If it corresponds to 
my hopes, and these hopes spring from the people, then I will 
sign it," he stated. 
  Lech Walesa declared his support for the head of the 
Ministry 
of National Defense, who announced that he will institute legal 
proceedings in the Constitutional Tribunal because the Sejm 
encroached upon the powers of the executive branch by ordering 
the Defense Ministry to purchase equipment made exclusively in 
Poland. "In new democracies, when new deputies come, they think 
that everything depends on them," he added. 
  Commenting on his conflict with the National Council of 
Radio 
and Television [KRRiT], the president said: "I expect several 
moves that will make the task easier for me." Asked what kinds 
of moves he meant, he said: "effective," and, on the part of 
KRRiT, moves "making action and life easier for the president." 
Asked about the possibility of Ryszard Bender's leaving the 
council, he said that he has a few friends in KRRiT. Concerning 
Andrzej Zaorski, who is said to be the presidential candidate 
for the council's chairman, the president said: "He is a good 
expert." As to the candidacy of Aleksander Kwasniewski to the 
post of president, he said: "He will definitely be defeated by 
me." 
  Lech Walesa may refuse to sign the Budget Law, just like any 
other law. It would then return to the Sejm, which may overturn 
the presidential veto with a two-thirds majority vote. The 
Sejm's arithmetic suggests that the Sejm should not have any 
problem doing just that, if necessary. The lack of the 
president's signature would also in no way affect implementation 
of the budget.

  [Text] Warsaw, 11 Mar--Janusz Bryczkowski, leader of the 
"Self-Defense" National Front, told Polish Radio Three on Friday 
morning that money spent by him on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's 
Polish visit is an investment in the future president of Russia. 
  According to Bryczkowski, we cannot have an enemy in the 
future president of Russia. For Zhirinovskiy's visit, he will 
assign 300,000,000 zloty "for Poland." 
  "Zhirinovskiy is coming at a private invitation as a citizen 
of our great neighbor. He is a friend of Poland and declares 
this friendship at every opportunity. He will have a chance to 
confront what the newspapers write about him with reality," he 
said. 
  One of the main aims of the visits is to be the setting up 
of 
a nongovernment commission for political and economic 
cooperation, which will enhance the trade exchange between 
Poland and Russia. Several Russian banks and several "serious" 
Polish banks are to be incorporated in the cooperation. "A real 
goods exchange would begin then," the "Self-Defense" National 
Front leader said. 
  Zhirinovskiy's security will be guarded by the Misztal's 
private bodyguard firm as well as by a detachment of the 
"Self-Defense" National Front, all wearing specially purchased 
"nice, black uniforms." If there should be an attempt to expel 
Zhirinovskiy from Poland, they will be fighting against the 
police, the "Self-Defense" National Front leader announced. 
  Foreign journalists who would like to have an exclusive 
conversation with Zhirinovskiy will have to pay $1,000 a minute.

<F P=106> [Article by B.I.W. and P.W.R.: "Solidarity: Government </F>
Declared War"] 
  [Text] "The Government of the Republic of Poland has 
declared war on members of the Independent Self-Governing Trade 
Union `Solidarity' working in the railroads"--this according to 
the Solidarity National Committee [KK]. Repressive measures 
used against the railroad Solidarity were seen as similar To 
martial law, "similar to the one imposed on 13 December." 
  Unionists cited the consent for trains to run red lights on 
the day of the strike, which was denied by the minister's 
spokesperson. "A group of strike breakers has been prepared, 
which consists of former members of the Voluntary Reserve of 
Citizens Militia," claims Solidarity. "Despite that, from 0900 
to 1900 on Friday [11 March], trains will not go anywhere," 
declared the union. 
  The KK, which held a session in Lodz, threatens a general 
strike and protest to international organizations if the 
authorities do not stop taking repressive measures. The power 
plant and the mine in Belchatow are ready to go on strike; these 
enterprises have placed themselves at the disposal of the 
protest headquarters. Today there will be a warning strike in 
all mines. 
<H5>  Furious Unionists </H5>
  KK members were infuriated when railroad workers informed 
them about the repressions. A Solidarity spokesman said that, 
in mines and telecommunication centers, Solidarity members are 
intimidated. Railroad workers complained that directors cut off 
communications for plant committees, do not allow Solidarity 
members to perform their tasks on the day of the strike, 
strengthen police patrols and the Railroad Protection Services, 
and threaten layoffs. 
  Marian Krzaklewski said that the union can wait two or three 
days for the government to stop violating the rights of the 
unionists. After that time, a general strike may break out. 
Asked whether Solidarity will be able to stage such a protest 
because the strike fund is still accumulating, Krzaklewski 
answered: We will see. 
<H5>  Today Mines and Shipyards </H5>
  Participating in yesterday's strikes were five plants in the 
Koszalin region and a few dozen plants in the Lodz Voivodship 
(90 plants were assigned to take action; 21 are ready for a 
general strike). Strikes were also staged in 150 plants of the 
Silesian-Dabrowa branch of Solidarity--that is, in 50 more than 
the authorities of the region had assigned. Between 0600 and 
0800 today, all 64 pit-coal mines are supposed to strike. 
Regional Solidarity Head Marek Kempski told us that the 
situation in the region is so tense that in approximately six 
mines the break in work may last as long as 24 hours. It is 
also possible that some of them will want to begin a continuous 
strike. 
  The national demands of Solidarity will also be supported 
today by over a hundred plants in and around Gdansk, including 
most probably the Gdansk seaport, the Gdansk and Gdynia 
shipyards, and the Repair Shipyard. 
  Marian Krzaklewski stated that the next culmination point of 
the Solidarity action will come after 15 March.

<F P=106> [Article by A.F.T., B.C., B.I.W., and PAD: "The Friday </F>
Strike in the PKP Began on Thursday; Railroads Struggle"] 
  [Text] Freight traffic by rail was stopped yesterday, 
which was the beginning of the strike at some railway junctions 
of the Lower Silesian district--for example, in Czestochowa. It 
was announced that passenger trains would be stopped at 0300 on 
11 March. The nationwide strike by railroad workers will 
continue today into the evening, but Solidarity ["S"] does not 
rule out the possibility that it may last longer than that in 
some junctions unless the General Administration [DG] of the 
Polish State Railroads [PKP] stops "repressions and violations 
of unionists' rights." 
  It is not known whether the PKP will go on strike all over 
Poland because the DG is trying to "resist the illegal" action. 
According to "S", however, the activities of the DG will 
encounter the opposition of many employees (such as engine 
drivers--the permission to "pass red lights" and so the "strike 
impact" will be stronger). The DG PKP reported that it had 
forwarded a letter to the regional prosecutor's office, in which 
it wrote about the intention of the railroad S to violate the 
law. The Gdansk Region of "S" and mines were on strike 
yesterday; some of them were on strike for 18 to 24 hours. 
However, the scale of the miners' strikes is evaluated by "S" 
differently than by the boards of the coal partnerships. 
<H5>  The PKP Will Not Throw People Out </H5>
  DG PKP Press Spokesperson Anna Raczkowska stated on the 
evening of 10 March that she had received the first official 
report about the PKP strike on Thursday [10 March], when "in 
Silesia it had already begun 90 minutes earlier!" The DG PKP 
decided that this strike was illegal and sent information to 
that effect to the prosecutor's office. The strike will 
probably not be joined by the northern and central districts. 
According to the DG, losses resulting from the 10-hour strike 
will amount to 50 or 60 billion zlotys; approximately 3,300 
passenger trains will be stopped, and approximately 1.5 million 
people will have difficulty getting, among other places, to work. 
  PKP Director General Aleksander Janiszewski forwarded 
information "on the intention of violating the law" by the 
National Railroads Section of "S" to the prosecutor's office. 
He claims that "the section's chairman, Mr. Krzysztof Maminski, 
from 5 to 9 March" in the mass media "publicly encouraged people 
to organize a strike in the PKP on 11 March," which was contrary 
to the provisions of the Law on Resolving Collective Bargaining. 
"It is not true that we are implementing militarization of the 
railways, that we are cutting off telephone communications. We 
simply do not want fax machines to be used for the purposes of 
an illegal strike," he declared. 
  The director said that special regulations were issued for 
11 
March, which would limit the possibilities of entering the 
offices of employees who work different shifts; attempts to 
exchange some of the employees were made, so that those who do 
not want to strike would be able to work. The PKP will also 
employ the principle, in line with which trains may pass "on a 
special order"--that is, the same that "S" calls "passing the 
red lights." 
  "The enterprise should be governed by the administration, 
not by the trade unions." 
  The strikers will not be in any way punished, aside from the 
fact that they will not get remuneration for the period of the 
strike. Each of them will receive the scheduled wage increase. 
  "S" argues that the DG did not allow its members to issue 
information about the strike; in line with the law, this should 
be done five days ahead of time. It did not allow them to post 
information leaflets and thus arouse the interest of the people. 
  According to the Board of the Gdansk Region, approximately 
140 enterprises took part in the one-hour strike; among them 
were the following shipyards: Gdynia Shipyard, Navy Shipyard in 
Gdynia, Gdansk Shipyard, as well as Siarkopol. It is estimated 
that 70 percent of the work force took part in the protest. In 
line with the results of a quick opinion poll conducted by 
RZECZPOSPOLITA among directors of the enterprises, the scope of 
the strike was smaller than expected: In the Gdansk Shipyard, 
for instance, 25 percent of the work force was supposed to go on 
strike. The strike did not cause any losses at the port; 
neither departures nor arrivals of any ships were scheduled for 
that time. 
  "S" stated that yesterday's strike was a complete success. 
Presidents of the coal partnerships say that work at most of the 
mines was peaceful and uninterrupted. "S" reports that 50 mines 
were on strike from 0600 to 0800; the partnerships' presidents 
say that, in the overwhelming majority of mines, there were only 
rallies, lasting 15 minutes or so (according to the presidents, 
they were held in only some mines--for example, in the Gliwice 
partnerships, in three out of seven mines); after the rallies, 
the work force resumed work. The union emphasizes that the 
purpose of the "S" action is to resolve the problems of the work 
forces, not to hold strikes as such. The Silesian-Dabrowa 
branch of "S" reported that 18- or 24-hour strikes were staged 
in 19 mines (out of 70), including four zinc and lead mines, as 
well as in eight mines of the Bytom partnership (those miners 
began their strike on Wednesday night). The directors of the 
mines say that in only two mines were the majority of workers on 
strike; in the remaining mines, only a dozen or so percent of 
the work force participated. 
  In eight mines of the Vistula partnership, some of the 
workers staged an eight-hour strike. "S" speaks of the mines as 
a whole, whereas the president of the partnership lists them 
individually: In three mines, approximately 30 percent of the 
work force was on strike; in "Silesia," 50 percent; and in 
"Brzesc," the majority. "S" explains that the rallies may have 
been short, but mines fulfilled the quota of a two-hour protest 
by organizing strikes during all shifts.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol </F>
by Andrzej Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on 
the "Guest of Radio Zet" program--live] 
  [Excerpt] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is 
Industry Minister Marek Pol. Good morning to you, sir. 
  [Pol] Good morning. 
  [Woyciechowski] Miners in Silesia have been on strike since 
this morning. What do the miners demand from you, and what are 
you willing to give them? 
  [Pol] First of all, from what the organizers of the strike 
are saying, the miners are on strike over general issues--that 
is, regarding Solidarity's nationwide demands--and what I say is 
that [hesitating] the answer is always the same: Appropriate 
boards have been set up for talks with the government, and the 
purpose of the boards is to come to agreement over national 
demands by the trade unions and what they want to accomplish for 
the working class. It so happens that the trade unionists are 
not very eager to speak during sessions by the trilateral 
commission or by groups with the participation of the government 
and the trade unions that are negotiating social issues--they 
are much more eager to be heard in the media than during such 
meetings as I just mentioned. What they want is that real 
earnings be increased and that the Agreement on State-Owned 
Enterprises be implemented. When it comes to specific 
enterprises, the most frequent scenario is that, for instance, 
the specific enterprise's earning situation is the real reason 
for having a strike in that company. Then, when it deals with 
the nation, it is of course relatively easy to [words 
indistinct]... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In a word, the strike is 
simply about money? Is that the case, or does it also have a 
political nature? What is your assessment of [words 
indistinct]... 
  [Pol, interrupting] I mean, my view is that the intentions 
of the strike's organizers are political in many cases, but when 
it comes to the employees themselves, well, they make a decision 
to join the action because, on the one hand, they are told that 
no one wants to speak to trade unionists, which, by definition, 
stirs up emotions because that would be proof of the 
authorities' arrogance. Second, they are on strike because life 
in general is very hard for many people in Poland, including 
those in Silesia. So that provides quite good grounds for 
having a strike. 
  [Woyciechowski] But can one say that the strike is of a 
political nature? I mean, from your standpoint, not just as 
industry minister but also a leader of the Union of Labor? 
  [Pol] You know, when I watch the escalation of the trade 
unions' measures and the way they are being organized, as well 
as the kinds of regions where strikes are being organized or at 
least where such attempts are being made--I mean in the 
infrastructure, which is the most vulnerable, and also taking 
into account the fact that the strikes are being organized in 
very many cases in areas where poverty is not the worst at 
all--I think that in many cases one would have to apply a 
political label to these measures. I think the measures are a 
kind of politics vis-a-vis the current government. 
  [Woyciechowski] What could be the reason for the trade 
unions to organize political strikes? Is it to bring down the 
government? 
  [Pol] It is hard for me to answer that question with 
precision. You should rather ask the trade unionists about 
that. But it is a fact that this question remains: What next? I 
mean, after the government is brought down. 
  [Woyciechowski] [Words indistinct] some kind of a new 
government. That has always been the case. 
  [Pol] Frankly speaking, given the current political 
configuration in parliament--after all, the elections defined 
the parliament's composition this way--I cannot quite imagine 
any further attempts at an aggregation. Besides, my feeling is 
that any subsequent government would have to face precisely the 
same problem. After all, there have been governments in the past 
that were organized and established by Solidarity, and then the 
Solidarity trade union recalled those governments or influenced 
their recall because it could not see any possibility for 
cooperation anymore. Right now, we have a government that 
Solidarity definitely did not establish and a strike measure 
after four months--actually, very strong measures against the 
government's policies began after three months....[Pol pauses] 
All in all, I cannot quite imagine and I do not know whether the 
organizers of the strikes are asking themselves the question of 
what next. 
  [Woyciechowski] You mean what will happen next? Mr. 
Minister, could you give the miners a raise? If you were to do 
so, they would most probably cease their strike action. 
  [Pol] I mean, I am afraid they would not cease their strikes 
anyway because [words indistinct]... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But if the raise were to be 
substantial? 
  [Pol] A great number of the mining companies are reportedly 
on strike today--we will find out later what really 
happened--and a majority of the mines managed to gain some 
raises in the recent time period, first of all as a result of 
negotiations because only part of the mines were on strike and, 
in a majority of them, managements of the companies or of the 
mines somehow managed to come to agreement with the miners in a 
sensible manner, despite the fact that there are nine to 11 
trade unions in each mine. So I am quite surprised by the 
participation in the strikes of those mines that secured raises; 
in some cases, it is another in a series of strikes in a 
relatively short period of time. As for whether the minister or 
the government could give raises, generally speaking, the 
government's task is to formulate a policy that would allow for 
a gradual increase of earnings in a company. But, in practical 
terms, a company's economic policy is determined by the manager 
and the management because the manager is charged with the 
responsibility of whether the company will survive for the next 
few months or years, and whether it will be a permanent 
workplace for... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, you certainly have 
several telephone numbers in your notebook. You might call 
several mine directors and tell them to increwages. They would 
surely increase the wages because I am sure they are a little 
afraid of you, Mr. Minister. Why are you not doing that? 
  [Pol] I suppose that if I tried to exert that kind of 
pressure, some of the more reasonable directors would submit 
their resignations and others would perhaps act on such a 
suggestion; this would mean, however, that I would have to take 
on the responsibility for the functioning of this or that 
enterprise for several months or even years. The problem is, no 
one from Warsaw is able to take on the responsibility for the 
functioning of such an enterprise. Apart rom that, no one is 
formally entitled to do that. The right to run an enterprise in 
line with the art of the economy is possessed by the board of 
directors of that given enterprise. 
  [Woyciechowski] Those miners also demand that the debt 
burden of mines and steelworks be lessened. This decision is 
certainly up to you. What does the process of lessening the 
debt burden of mines mean? 
  [Pol] This means restructurization, which is the key word. 
The indebtedness of an enterprise, reaching some kind of an 
agreement with creditors... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Who are the creditors? 
  [Pol] They are most often other enterprises in Poland... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Which are also owned by the 
state? 
  [Pol] Both state and private companies, individual persons, 
the state budget, the budgets of gminas [smallest administrative 
units]... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And all of these mines, or 
almost all of them, are simply indebted, they have some enormous 
debts to pay? 
  [Pol] Enormous debts... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And what does the lessening of 
the debt burden mean... 
  [Pol, interrupting] The overall indebtedness of these mines 
exceeds 50 trillion zlotys. This is nearly as much as the 
state's budget deficit right now. The lessening of the debt 
burden means reaching agreements with the creditors. Because 
they are very numerous, it is the state's or the government's 
duty to prepare a law that would make this technically possible. 
There exists such a law; it is a settlement law. It is today a 
special law for state enterprises and state partnerships. It 
entails the possibility of bank settlement procedures with 
creditor enterprises, which in practice means the following: If 
over 50 percent of the creditors or creditors that have loaned 
more than 50 percent of the entire debt agree to limit the debt 
of the mine or a group of mines, such an agreement is 
implemented and concerns all of the creditors, even those that 
have not agreed to that. In practice, this means considerably 
less severe conditions... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That simply means that the 
debt will not be paid off? This reminds me of the operation 
that Poland is trying to perform with Western banks. 
  [Pol] Exactly. Unfortunately, in the case of the mines, the 
debt reductions are much greater than...[Pol pauses] Or the 
abandoning of the demand that the debt be repaid is much greater 
than in the case of Poland's debts. In that case, it often 
exceeds 50 percent. To make a long story short, the state must 
create the necessary conditions and laws to implement this. 
Now, the very operation of lessening the debt must be performed 
by the enterprises themselves. The government, especially the 
Industry Ministry, provides aid to enterprises that are 
experiencing problems... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Does that mean that it 
provides financial aid to them or comforts them... 
  [Pol, interrupting] It either provides them with good 
companies that know how to prepare such documents... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That means that it sends good 
lawyers? 
  [Pol] Yes, it sends good lawyers, good cooperators. 
Sometimes it almost forces the managers of a given enterprise. 
All of this entails a lot of work... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You can force them to do 
something, after all, then? 
  [Pol] Yes, I can. It so happens that, as far as mining is 
concerned, we force them, in a sense, but also standardize the 
proceedings in the case of coal partnerships. All of the coal 
partnerships have already found themselves in the process of 
lessening the debt burden. I will not conceal the fact that the 
judges who supervise those proceedings are probably a little 
alarmed when they hear the information about the miners' strike; 
it so happens that on strike are those enterprises that in 
courts of law will want to reach an agreement with their 
creditors--that is, enterprises that have not gone on strike.

  [Text] The prosecutors' department of the Ministry of 
Justice confirms that the ministry regulations regarding the 
sponsorship of the police arouse serious doubts as to their 
accordance with the law in force. In the view of Wlodzimierz 
Cimoszewicz, justice minister and deputy prime minister, 
sponsorship of the police ought to be decisively broken off. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] In the course of a news 
conference, Minister Cimoszewicz revealed that there had also 
been a wish to sponsor the prosecutor's office. Fortunately, 
this did not come about, he added. 
  [Cimoszewicz] "This was unambiguously cut off after the 
first 
case. This was never ever repeated." 
  [Correspondent] In the minister's view, the police ought to 
behave similarly. In accordance with the law of June 1990, the 
police are financed from the state budget. Today, there are not 
sufficient legal grounds for them to be sponsored. The 
principles for the accepting of gifts by the police are 
regulated by three documents, of which none is law. There is 
the minister of internal affairs' decree, an instruction by the 
director of the finance department of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, and a letter from the main commandant [of the police]. 
It is not precluded that the issue of sponsorship will be the 
main thread in the investigation into corruption in the Poznan 
police. Minister Cimoszewicz was surprised at the decision of 
the voivodship prosecutor's office in Warsaw, which shortly 
wishes to interview Dariusz Rossati, the candidate of the 
Democratic Left Alliance for [the post of] minister of finance. 
The interview is in association with Rossati's work on the 
supervisory board of the Foreign Indebtedness Servicing Fund 
[FOZZ]. 
  [Cimoszewicz] "What the composition of the supervisory board 
of this fund was has been known for a long time. Why is it only 
now necessary to determine the address at which Mr. Rossati 
lives in Geneva? He has been living there for quite some time." 
  [Correspondent] The minister's doubts are also shared by the 
head of the prosecutors' department. 
  [Waldemar Smardzewski, director of the prosecutors' 
department of the Ministry of Justice] "In the near future, I 
will clarify the reasons it has been acknowledged that it is 
appropriate now to precisely carry through this procedural 
event, which could have been carried out a long, long time ago. 
So, why is this raised only now?" 
  [Correspondent] According to the information in the hands of 
journalists, the capital prosecutor's office today asked the 
Ministry of Justice whether it is to question Rossati. Such an 
obligation has been laid upon it by the appeal court,

  [Text] Poland has reached an agreement with the London 
Club, whose members are our commercial bank creditors. 
Difficult negotiations have been going on for four years, and 
finally last night there was a breakthrough. Agreement was 
reached on the main conditions for settling the Polish debt. 
  These conditions include a comprehensive and realistic 
reduction of the debt, according to the statement published this 
morning. Mr. Krzysztof Krowacki, who led our delegation, says 
the agreement fulfills the basic requirements of the Polish 
side. First of all, our payments will be within the framework 
of the projected capabilities of the balance of payments and the 
state budget. They will be low in the first five years and will 
remain low during the most intensive period of payments due in 
accordance with agreements with the Paris Club. All of the 
components of the debt have been reduced. Also reduced were the 
costs of servicing the debt. Repayment periods will be longer, 
payments per one unit of debt will be lower, and the debt itself 
will be reduced further. The combined reduction of the debt 
exceeds 45 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Bazyl Lipszyc: "There Was No Affair; </F>
Unofficial Talk"] 
  [Text] There was no affair with regard to fixing the 
price of bank shares. There were just irregularities when it 
comes to getting the shares [of recently privatized Bank Slaski] 
into circulation, which should be cleared up, Sejm deputies say 
unofficially. What happened was an "accident at work"; these 
cannot be avoided in the process of privatization. The deputies 
are very much in agreement when it comes to expressing their 
views on this, regardless of their political affiliation. 
  "In my view, there has been no Bank Slaski affair," says 
former Finance Minister Jerzy Osiatynski of the Democratic Union 
[UD]. "But what did happen for sure are irregularities in the 
functioning of the bank's brokerage house, and these must be 
cleared up. What also needs to be examined is whether there has 
not been a conspiracy among the bank's employees aimed at 
artificially raising the shares' prices to a level that would 
not be justified economically. But that should be discussed now 
by representatives of the commission that was in charge of the 
issue, inasmuch as I am a bit of a judge in my own case here." 
  There was no affair, there are just a great deal of 
experiences linked to the privatization process, and I agree 
with the view that the same kind of decision (regarding fixing 
the prices of the shares) would have to be made today, as well, 
said Jacek Piechota of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], while 
Ryszard Ulicki, of the same Sejm deputies club, said that what 
happened in the case resulted from the "crawling on all fours" 
stage at which the financial system now operates; it is also a 
kind of "accident at work" and a lesson for the future. 
  In the view of the SLD's Adam Halber, if there was an affair 
at all, it only applied to allowing the shares into circulation. 
According to him, it is hard to say currently whether that is 
due to negligence, mindlessness, or something else, and that 
must be cleared up. Halber says that if all of the shares could 
get to the stock market at the same time, their prices would be 
set at a reasonable level. According to SLD Sejm Deputy Roman 
Nowicki, the case is a political game and a game of interests, 
not an affair. Someone is eager to be on the front pages of the 
newspapers. But that does not help the capital market. Nowicki 
also says that the issue should be examined, but it has to be 
done without emotion. 
  According to Zbigniew Bujak of the Union of Labor, there are 
two serious issues involved: First of all, the principle of 
equal access to the stock market for everyone who purchased 
shares, was not observed--and that is an affair. The other 
issue is participation by employees who had an opportunity to 
sell the shares and who bought more shares (at preferential 
prices) than they were entitled to. 
  Janusz Dobrosz, press spokesman of the Sejm Deputies Club of 
the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], expressed his support for a 
statement made by Bogdan Pek. Dobrosz said the statement 
cleared up the matter of fixing the share prices and the issue 
of the strategic investor. Their colleagues from the same Sejm 
deputies club can see no affair with regard to price fixing or 
the investor. If there was any affair at all, it pertained to 
completely different kinds of problems. 
  According to Sejm Deputy Jacek Cieciora (PSL), the fact that 
the shares were put into circulation at a time when only shares 
of the employees were on the stock market, was an affair. 
Cieciora says that was what raised the prices to such a high 
level. If there could just be 30 to 40 percent of the shares on 
the stock market, there would be no issue at all, and the 
shares' price would be 2 to 2.5 million zlotys, which "would be 
all right." Jerzy Pistelok (also of the PSL) thinks that hopes 
were stirred up among people for making very big money in a 
short amount of time, which caused the hurried efforts to 
acquire the shares. According to Pistelok, one can speak of 
irregularities that must be cleared up. 
  Only Grazyna Staniszewska of UD, who is deputy chairwoman of 
the Sejm Ownership Transformations Commission, said she does not 
really know whether there was an affair or not because a lot of 
doubts must still be cleared up and conclusions formulated after 
eight hours of debate by the commission. So, according to her, 
the Sejm debate on the issue is premature because all it can do 
is discuss suspicions. 
  There was no Bank Slaski affair. There is just the issue of 
Sejm Deputy Pek who, through his statements and ignorance of 
economics, put many stock market gamblers at risk of significant 
losses. This is how the problem was summed up by a few Sejm 
deputies for UD, who wanted to remain anonymous. 
  There was also unofficial talk in the Sejm to the effect 
that 
Bogdan Pek managed to become a widely known politician over a 
short period of time (at the expense of Bank Slaski), and that 
he is better in this than Jan Komornicki (also of the PSL), who 
failed to gain this kind of popularity while trying to track 
down, as the idea's author and a commission chief, "crimes of 
the Hanna Suchocka government."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Second Serbian Submarine Sighted in </F>
Adriatic Sea"; as released by The Hague ANP Database] 
  [Text] The Hague, 8 Mar (ANP) -- Western naval ships have 
observed a second Serbian submarine in the Adriatic Sea. It was 
already known that a Heroj-class submarine, the "Uskok," had 
already sailed. Now, however, a Sava-class submarine has also 
been observed, a navy spokesman confirmed. Each boat can be 
fitted out with 10 torpedoes. 
  Western ships are patrolling the Adriatic Sea in order to 
supervise the UN oil and arms embargo against the former 
Yugoslavia. The Netherlands ships serving there are the "Jacob 
van Heemskerck" and the "Van Kinsbergen." 
  The Adriatic Sea is not a no-go area for submarines from 
Serbia and Montenegro, the navy spokesman said. He did say, 
however, that it was interesting that a second submarine was 
operational.

  [Text] Prague, March 10 (CTK) -- One hundred and twenty 
troops forming the Czech UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection 
Force] unit will be deployed in the Croatian area of Zepce north 
of Sarajevo, the Czech defense minister said on Thursday. 
  Speaking at a meeting of the parliamentary foreign committee 
discussing the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Antonin 
Baudys said the transport will take place on March 15. 
  Asked whether the soldiers knew they were going to protect a 
Serbian enclave surrounded by Bosnian Muslims, Baudys said all 
of the soldiers volunteered for inclusion in the unit. They 
will be equipped with submachine guns and bulletproof vests and 
will use 14 armored personnel carriers, 11 trucks, five "special 
trailers" and one ambulance. 
  UNPROFOR command has not yet announced how long the unit, 
which is to operate within a Jordanian regiment, would be 
stationed in Croatia. [as received] 
  The Czech government approved the consignment on Wednesday 
[9 
March].

  [Text] Sofia, March 10 (BTA) -- In response to an inquiry 
made by the Bulgarian Embassy in Belgrade and the urgent demands 
for returning the crew, the cargo and the Khan Kubrat ship, the 
director of the Yugoslav River Shipping Company said that the 
cargo is being unloaded. According to the director, both the 
buyer and the seller are in Prahovo, their identity has not been 
revealed and they have presented regular documents, a spokesman 
for the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry said. 
  The crew is safe. 
  This information has not been confirmed by official 
representatives of the Serbian Government which the Bulgarian 
Embassy approached. 
  In this connection the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Republic of Bulgaria summoned the charge d'affaires of the 
Embassy of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Mr. Smilkovic and 
set forth once again Bulgaria's demand for clarifying all 
circumstances around the incident and for the immediate return 
of the crew, the ship and its cargo to Bulgaria, the spokesman 
of the Foreign Ministry said. 
  The hijacked Bulgarian ship Khan Kubrat is in the Serbian 
village of Prahovo. The tugboat is at the port itself and the 
six barges loaded with fuel are 2 km away, customs officials 
told the BTA correspondent in Vidin this morning. The 
information was received late last night from SANCOM [UN 
Sanctions Committee] representatives who are near the Romanian 
town of Turnu Severin. According to the same source, on the 
morning of March 9 the Bulgarian tugboat left the area of the 
port, which prompted the report that the Khan Kubrat had left 
Prahovo. But the tugboat only made a manoeuvre and took one of 
the barges loaded with fuel to the terminal. The tugboat and 
one of the barges are in position, the BTA correspondent 
reported, citing information provided by SANCOM officers.

  [Text] Warsaw, 10 Mar -- Poland did not abstain from voting 
in Geneva on a resolution demanding that China observe human 
rights -- it only supported a motion tabled by the delegation of 
the People's Republic of China that no vote should be taken on 
this resolution, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Stanislaw 
Szymanski told the Sejm on Thursday [10 March]. 
  A question regarding the motives of the Polish stand was put 
by deputies Bogdan Borusewicz, Henryk Wujec, and Andrzej Potocki 
(UD) [Democratic Union]. 
  Szymanski assured his listeners that had a vote on the 
resolution been taken Poland would certainly not have voted 
against it. "Poland attaches importance to human rights but 
there are matters which are complicated and difficult to assess, 
which make it impossible to take an unequivocal decision," said 
Szymanski. He reported that the resolution on China contained, 
for the first time, mentions of Tibet, not only in the context 
of human rights. He added that the UN Commission of Human 
Rights did not have a mandate to involve itself with territorial 
and political problems. 
  "I know nothing about a representative of China at the 
United 
Nations commission informing a Polish representative a day 
before the voting that he would be receiving instructions from 
Warsaw to abstain from voting," said Szymanski. At the request 
of the UD deputies he revealed which countries had taken the 
same stand as Poland regarding the resolution. These include, 
among others, Barbados, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Cyprus, 
Ecuador, Lesotho, Mauritius, Mexico, Peru, Romania, Uruguay, and 
Venezuela.

  [Text] Budapest, 9 Mar (MTI) -- A Hungarian-Romanian 
military cooperation agreement, covering 20 programmes in each 
country this year, has been signed by military leaders of the 
two countries, Lieut.-Gen. Janos Deak, commander and 
chief-of-staff of the Hungarian Army, told a press conference in 
Bucharest today. Deak has been the head of a delegation to 
Bucharest since Sunday. 
  This is one of the regular official meetings between the two 
armies, Deak added. Lieut.-Gen. Dumitru Cioflina, Romanian 
chief- of-staff and Deak's host, led a delegation to Hungary in 
1992. Since then several other meetings have taken place at the 
level of generals and troop officers. 
  The Hungarian delegation held talks with Cioflina and 
visited 
an artillery unit in Ploesti. Gheorghe Tinca, inaugurated as 
defence minister on Tuesday, is to meet the delegation today. 
The commander of the Hungarian Army said that the change in 
Romania's defence leadership would not effect the presently 
fair, unbroken and wide- ranging cooperation between the staffs 
and units of the two armies, which has been capped by the "Open 
Skies" agreement. 
  The discussions touched upon possible cooperation within the 
framework of NATO's Partnership for Peace scheme, which both 
countries have supported, Deak said. 
  The Romanian partners provided in-depth information 
concerning the ongoing transformation of Romanian armed forces, 
including the forthcoming withdrawal of tactical and operational 
missiles, which the Hungarian delegation welcomed.

especially in the field of high-energy physics. President 
Zhelev confirmed Bulgaria's determination to gain full CERN 
membership which has already been granted to some Central 
European countries. 
  The Deputy Minister of Science and Education Prof. Boris 
Gulubov, who is accompanying the President, handed the CERN 
managers a draft update of the effective agreement on 
cooperation and expressed the readiness of the Bulgarian

  [Text] Koln, March 9--A six-person Polish delegation 
negotiated on Monday and Tuesday in Bonn an agreement on 
cooperation between police and the customs services of Poland 
and Germany and a technical protocol on re-admission of people 
who arrived in Germany via Poland and violated the terms of stay 
in that country. 
  "Talks with Germans were conducted in a good atmosphere," 
said Polish Deputy Interior Minister Henryk Jasik before his 
return to Poland from Germany on Wednesday morning. 
  Jasik said that contacts between the leadership of the 
Polish 
and German Interior Ministries developed well while Polish 
Interior Minister Andrzej Milczanowski and his German 
counterpart had a good mutual understanding. 
  According to the asylum agreement of May 1993, Poland 
promised to earmark half of German aid (out of the global sum of 
120 million DM) for the purchase of equipment in Germany. German 
firms, however, offered equipment which is on the average twice 
as expensive as that offered by other suppliers. The delegation 
pointed to the fact during the present talks. The German 
Interior Ministry is entitled to buy equipment from German 
producers at reduced prices and the Polish delegation asked 
Germans to buy the equipment for Poland on the same principles. 
  It cannot be ruled out that the two documents, that is the 
technical protocol on readmission of people arriving in Germany 
via Poland and the agreement on cooperation of Police and 
customs services of Poland and Germany will be ready for signing 
in spring 1994. The second round of talks on the matter is 
scheduled to be held in Warsaw in a few weeks time.

  [Text] Luxembourg, March 9 -- Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski discussed in Luxembourg on Wednesday with his 
Luxembourg counterpart Jacques Poos the issue of strengthening 
the status of Poland and other Central European states as 
prospective members of the Western European Union (WEU). 
Jacques Poos is the head of the Council of WEU. 
  Olechowski and Poos discussed also Poland's relations with 
the European Union and NATO. 
  A debate on the status of Poland and other Central European 
states which have been WEU's partners for consultation is still 
being held and should end at a session of the Council of WEU 
scheduled to take place in Luxembourg on May 9-10, Poos stressed 
at a joint press conference ending Olechowski's visit to 
Luxembourg. 
  Poos expressed his hope that during the May session the 
Western European Union would agree on granting Poland and other 
countries of the region a status very close to association. He 
admitted, however, that such a status would not give Poland 
"legal security guarantees but will enable its full 
participation in political discussions and its gradual inclusion 
into joint operations in the military sphere". 
  According to Olechowski, the associate status with the WEU 
would be better for Poland than its partnership with NATO. 
  During his one-day official visit to Luxembourg Olechowski 
was also received by Grand Duke Jean and Prime Minister Jacques 
Santer.

<F P=106> ["We Are Looking Forward to Albania's Participation in NATO </F>
-- the Speech of Louis Bouvard, chairman of the North Atlantic 
Assembly to the Albanian Parliament" -- ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, March 10 (ATA) -- "The chairman of the 
North Atlantic Assembly has the honour of addressing one the 
oldest and bravest peoples in Europe. The wars waged by your 
country through centuries and the oppression exerted by one of 
the severest communist dictatorships in the world didn't subdue 
the legendary resistance of 'The eagle's sons.' You have been 
looked down upon until recently, but now you are manifesting an 
unprecedented zeal to integrate into Europe and Western 
democracies. 
  "Showing our affection towards your country, I decided to 
accept your invitation and visit your country. 
  "According to my proposal in Berlin a year ago, and with the 
unanimous approval of all our delegations, Albania became an 
associate member of our Assembly. In this context I have come 
to strengthen our relations. We are proud that you are among 
us. Your so fraternal and warm welcome you are extending to us, 
confirms once again that there is no doubt that you are part of 
Europe and you will be fully committed to your so important role. 
  "You showed your loyalty to the international community by 
giving the warships of NATO and the Western European Union fully 
access to your waters to supervise the embargo against former 
Yugoslavia, thus placing the interest of regional stability 
above your personal interest. We are so indebted to you in this 
regard. 
  "You showed your solidarity with NATO last month by 
proposing 
them to use your air bases in order to apply the measures 
envisaged by the ultimatum addressed to those who were attacking 
Sarajevo. You knew well the danger that was threatening you, 
anyhow you accepted to undertake this act being convinced that 
only this decision would help accelerate the re establishment of 
peace in Bosnia. 
  "You offered your cooperation to some of our Alliance 
members 
for the realisation of a number of initiatives they had 
undertaken. Thus, by allowing U.S. aircrafts to come to your 
country to survey the movements of the military troops in former 
Yugoslavia, you once more placed the interest of the regional 
security above the personal interests. I assure you that these 
acts have been welcome by the governments and parliaments of the 
NATO member countries. 
  "Your president signed in Brussels some weeks ago, the 
documents which will allow your country to strengthen its 
cooperation with our Alliance through Partnership For Peace. We 
do not forget that Albania has been one of the first countries 
to reply positively to the offer for Partnership For Peace 
presented in the extraordinary meeting of NATO on January of 
this year. This is a testimony to your good will not only to 
continue but also to have faster rates in your reforms to change 
your defence structure aiming at harmonising them better with 
the principles, means and procedures of the NATO. 
  "Accepting Albania as an associate member last year and I 
hail you on this occasion Mr. Selami who has made a great 
contribution to this direction, the Assembly of North [as 
received] aimed at making its contribution to precenting the 
escalation of war in the zone around you. We hope this act will 
serve as an encouragement for the leaders of our countries to be 
more sensitive towards your problems because security in the 
Balkans is security for Europe as well. 
  "You are right to be worried about the fate of the 2 million 
Albanians in Kosova. Nonviolent resistance of the Albanians 
headed by President Rugova deserves the support of the 
international community. Believe me, I share this worry with 
you with regard to the Serbian decision for the expulsion of the 
CSCE observers mission some months ago. Personally I am 
convinced that our Alliance will do its best for this decision 
to be reconsidered. We should see the possibility of military 
and civil deployment of observers in Kosova, as it is being 
operated in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM]. Our Alliance should use all its influence in support 
or talks which will lead to the establishment of a status which 
will observe the fundamental rights of the Albanians in Kosova 
because without resolving this problem stability in this zone 
will not last long. 
  "We also know your preoccupation to ensure for the numerous 
Albanians in Macedonia a full recognition of their civil rights. 
Your wisdom towards this neighbouring country, which is hardly 
coming into its full shape, and the political and economic 
support towards it are a guarantee for the stability in this 
zone. We also support your efforts for the normalisation of the 
tensions in the relations between some Albanian and Greek 
communities. 
  "We know that the losses inflicted to you by the embargo 
towards former Yugoslavia have to do not only with your security 
and the determination of the Albanian Government to strictly 
observe the international sanctions is a full justification for 
your demands for compensations. International community is 
rather delayed in studying the possibilities for the creation of 
a fund of compensation for the new democratic regimes which are 
greatly affected by the consequences of the embargo in this 
difficult economic transition period. 
  "Even after a cease-fire, which is a necessary preliminary 
condition, peace in the Balkans will not be established unless 
the peoples of this zone have a fair standard of living and the 
ability to use the assets of their countries and their talent to 
be more and more prosperous. 
  "Your resolute economic policy despite sacrifices to be made 
by your people, is now yielding its fruits. I am glad to see 
that investments in Albania are on the increase. The French, my 
compatriots, occupy now an important share in these investments, 
but I am convinced that the traditional relations that link you 
country with mine, France, need more serious endeavours from 
these countries. 
  "For nearly fifty years your country was self isolated by 
the 
rest of the continent. What a misfortune! The enthusiasm with 
which you are breaking through this isolation arouses great 
hopes in you and us. Let me say and you should believe me that 
we are going to help you in your revival, just as we have faith 
in the revival of a stable peace because we are a single 
European and Atlantic family. We are looking forward to seeing 
independent and solidarist Albania a NATO member, a cradle of a 
great culture as well an examplary case for the democracies of 
our great Alliance. I am convinced of this.

<F P=106> ["Foreign Ministry Works To Free Albanian Pair Arrested in </F>
Montenegro" -- ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, March 8 (ATA) -- The Yugoslav charge 
d'affaires was called to the Foreign Ministry on March 3, for a 
discussion of the arrest in Montenegro of Socialist Party Deputy 
Moikom Zeqo and the chairman of the National Unity Party, Idajet 
Beqiri. The charge informed ministry officials that on February 
27th at about 2300 [2200 GMT] hours during a normal check of a 
car with Yugoslav plates in the village of Zelenovice of Ulqin 
district, police arrested Zeqo and Beqiri because they had no 
visas for Yugoslavia. They apparently had entered Yugoslavia 
illegally by crossing Lake of Shkoder by boat. 
  On March 4, the Albanian Government demanded that the 
Yugoslav authorities describe the conditions of the detainees 
and say what measures have been taken against them, but Yugoslav 
Embassy had no further information. The Albanians have lodged a 
protest demanding that visas be issued for three persons who are 
supposed to be in touch with the arrested men. At the same time 
the Albanian Embassy in Belgrade was informed, and the charge 
d'affaires was sent to Montenegro immediately. 
  Several demands have been sent to the Yugoslav Embassy in 
Tirana, but so far no news has been received about the arrested 
men and no visas have been issued to those who like to visit 
them.

<F P=106> [From BTA's 11 March "Press Review"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sofia, March 11 (BTA) -- Today's press 
front-pages comments on the cardiac operation Prime Minister 
Berov is to undergo. Prof. Berov had a heart attack on March 8, 
at about 2 a.m. [1200 GMT], and was taken to hospital. He will 
be operated to have a bypass implanted, DUMA and 24 CHASA say. 
TRUD quotes Military Medical Academy Head Colonel Prof. Milan 
Petrov as saying the prime minister could be either operated 
within 15 days or get back to work first and have the operation 
on a later date. The Constitution does not specify the period 
during which the prime minister can be away from work neither 
does it answer a number of questions pertaining to the powers of 
the person sitting in for the prime minister (Deputy Prime 
Minister Evgeni Matinchev in this case), OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK 
writes. According to anonymous sources cited by this daily, the 
activity the acting prime minister is to perform are purely 
administrative. DEMOKRATSIYA, too, quotes anonymous sources as 
saying the Constitutional Court should be approached to rule on 
the powers of the person replacing the prime minister and thus 
fill in the gap in the effective legislation. New Policy Centre 
leader Dimitur Ludzhev yesterday called on acting Prime Minister 
Matinchev to resign, 24 CHASA reports. Prime Minister Berov is 
unlikely to return to politics, this daily quotes Mr. Ludzhev 
and goes on to say that Prof. Berov intends to hand in his 
resignation in case he is unable to soon return to his duties. 
STANDART NEWS for its part quotes Deputy Prime Minister 
Matinchev as saying the relations between himself and the other 
deputy prime minister, Valentin Karabashev, would not 
destabilize the cabinet's performance simply because there is no 
conflict between them. According to Mr. Ludzhev, to be ruled by 
Evgeni Matinchev for Bulgaria would be the same as to be ruled 
by Todor Zhivkov (this country's former communist dictator), 
DUMA says. Dimitur Ludzhev pledged to introduce a vote of no 
confidence in the cabinet headed by Mr. Matinchev when Prof. 
Berov recuperates. According to DUMA, he also predicted 
elections to be held this autumn. OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK quotes 
Mr. LUDZHEV as alleging Evgeni Matinchev to be a former 
communist functionary. The Podkrepa Labour Confederation (one 
of Bulgaria's two major trade unions) does not support Prof. 
Berov's cabinet, 24 CHASA learned from a forum this labour 
organization held in Stara Zagora (southern Bulgaria). [passage

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov by BTA </F>
Bulgarian Economic Outlook (BEO) Correspondent Nacho Khalachev; 
placer and date not given: "Bulgaria Pursues Sovereign Foreign 
Policy"] 
  [Text] Sofia, March 11 (BTA) (You can read the 
interview's full text in BEO No. 10 of March 11-17, 1994.) 
  Q.: Minister, which are Bulgaria's foreign policy priorities 
now, in view of the changes which have taken place in this 
country? 
  A.: Bulgaria pursues a sovereign foreign policy, proceeding 
from its national interests and based on the universal standards 
of international law. Our efforts are directed towards the 
attainment of two strategic objectives: identifying an optimum 
national security framework and creating foreign political 
conditions for this country's transition to a market economy and 
mitigation of any adverse external factors in this field. 
  These strategic objectives determine Bulgaria's specific 
priorities, and above all the integration into the European 
political, economic and military organizations and the 
Euro-Atlantic security structures. The entry into force of 
Bulgaria's Europe agreement will bring us considerably closer to 
the European Union. At the same time, we will persist in our 
efforts to promote economic contacts with the EFTA countries. 
Bulgaria joined NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative and 
will take an active part in it; will probably be granted special 
status within the framework of the Western European Union. 
Bulgaria will be the first postcommunist state to preside over 
the Council of Europe. 
  Other priorities include promoting dialogue and updating the 
contractual and legal framework of Bulgaria's relations with the 
industrialized nations. At the same time, Bulgaria will also 
seek to maintain active cooperation with the countries of 
Eastern Europe, with Russia, Ukraine and the other countries of 
the former Soviet Union. 
  It is our task to assist the creation of an external 
environment that would guarantee our national security and 
economic development. And this task is closely related to 
Bulgaria's activities in the Balkans. Bulgaria will continue to 
pursue balanced contacts with its next-door neighbours. 
  Q.: What are the objectives of Bulgarian diplomacy in Black 
Sea Economic Cooperation? 
  A.: Bulgaria has supported the idea for Black Sea Economic 
Cooperation from the very beginning and has substantially 
contributed to the drafting and adoption of the documents on its 
establishment. Bulgaria believes that Black Sea Economic 
Cooperation need not turn into a closed integration community 
but should rather continue developing as an open form of 
regional economic cooperation, allowing its members to integrate 
into the European structures. 
  Bulgarian diplomacy is also seeking to expedite work on 
specific projects and on the achievement of concrete results 
mainly in transport, communications, trade, power engineering, 
environmental protection, science and technology, agriculture 
and tourism. 
  Q.: How does Bulgarian diplomacy intend to help Bulgaria 
regain and expand its market positions in the former Soviet 
Union? 
  A.: Bulgarian-Russian relations are gradually entering the 
stage of practical solution of outstanding problems, especially 
in the trade and economic field. Our principal aim is clear: 
To restore and strengthen the positions which Bulgaria has lost 
in this boundless market. The Bulgarian-Russian Mixed 
Commission will hold its second session in March to discuss 
mainly economic issues such as debt settlement, payments system, 
facilitating Bulgarian imports, and transport connections, 
including the idea of a ferry service between Varna and 
Novorossiysk. Bulgaria believes that trilateral talks should be 
held with Russia and Ukraine to make efficient use of the 
existing transport infrastructure. 
  The foundations of trade and economic cooperation with 
states 
of Central Asia and the Caucasus are being laid on the 
initiative of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry. This is a 
difficult and slow process, but concrete results have already 
been achieved. A protocol on the establishment of a joint 
Balkan Credit Bank was signed with Kazakhstan in 1993. 
  Trade, financial and transport agreements are expected to be 
signed this year with Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and 
Uzbekistan. 
  Q.: To what extent are the priorities of Bulgarian diplomacy 
determined by this country's economic interests? 
  A.: Bulgarian diplomacy still attaches primary importance to 
seeking solutions and assisting various international 
institutions and advanced countries for compensation of 
Bulgaria's embargo- related losses and alleviating their burden 
on its economy. 
  I believe there is broad political consensus in this country 
on the invariability of the policy line towards Bulgaria's full 
integration into the European economic area. You have witnessed 
Bulgarian diplomatic activity over the past few years which 
resulted in the signing of a Europe Agreement and an Interim 
Trade Agreement between Bulgaria and the European Union. An 
free trade agreement with the EFTA countries has already entered 
into force. We intend to make still more active use of the 
European Union's cooperation programmes and maximize the funds 
provided within the framework of the PHARE [Economic 
Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] programme. 
Bulgaria's full integration into the European Union is a 
long-term target of this country's foreign policy. 
  I would like to stress the special importance we attach to 
our relations with GATT. The negotiations have reached a 
decisive stage. Bulgaria's accession to that organization would 
guarantee this country equal participation in world economy and 
trade, upgrade its international prestige and encourage foreign 
investment. 
  Q.: Minister, thank you for this interview.

  [Text] Sofia, March 9 (BTA) -- Deputy Prime Minister 
Evgeni Matinchev today received a government delegation of the 
Russian Federation, led by Chairman of the State 
Machine-Building Committee Anatoliy Ogurtsov. The meeting was 
attended by Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev, Chairman 
of the Power Engineering Committee Nikita Shervashidze, and 
Deputy Minister of Industry Racho Petrov. The prospects of 
Bulgarian-Russian relations in industry were on the agenda. 
  Mr. Ogurtsov declared that Russian enterprises are now ready 
for wide-scale cooperation with Bulgaria and for all-round 
assistance. He stressed that this is the official stand of the 
Russian Government. The sides considered some specific aspects 
of cooperation in power and mechanical engineering, the debts 
which Bulgaria and Russia owe each other and some other problems. 
  Mr. Karabashev familiarized the guests with the Bulgarian 
Government's decision on reciprocal settlement of obligations 
and asked Mr. Ogurtsov to assist for a prompt reply from the 
Russian Government, containing its specific proposals on the 
matter, the Government said in a press release.

  [Text] Sofia, March 10 (BTA) -- The government adopted at 
its meeting today regulations for the Interdepartmental 
Committee on Environment and Development, set up last year. The 
document regulates issues concerning the committee's structure, 
operation and relations with other departments. The committee 
will help ministries and departments publicize opportunities to 
move and requirements for priority environmental protection 
projects. 
  The ministers approved draft agreements on trade and 
economic 
cooperation between Bulgaria and Armenia, Azerbaijan and 
Uzbekistan as a basis for negotiations. They also approved a 
draft agreement on reciprocal investment protection and 
promotion between Bulgaria and Poland. At the suggestion of the 
Minister of Industry Rumen Bikov the cabinet gave consent to 
admit Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus as full members of the 
International Centre for Scientific and Technical Information in 
Moscow. 
  The government decided to propose to President Zhelyu Zhelev 
to appoint Bulgaria's ambassador to Spain Mikhail Petkov also 
ambassador to Andorra. The Council of Ministers gave permission 
to the Embassy of Tunisia to open a polling station here during 
the presidential and parliamentary elections in that country due 
to be held on March 20, 1994. 
  The cabinet returned a proposal to open new border 
checkpoints, one on the River Danube, and two on the Black Sea, 
for a reconsideration of its expediency and of ways to fund them. 
  After the meeting the Cabinet held a lengthy closed-door 
discussion, said national radio tonight, quoting Acting Prime 
Minister Evgeni Matinchev. [passage omitted] 
  In a televised interview tonight Deputy Prime Ministers 
Evgeni Matinchev and Valentin Karabashev dwelled on the problems 
of privatization and expressed their dissatisfaction with its 
progress. 
  The privatization of major units such as hotels and banks is 
bound to provoke heated disputes in Bulgaria, Mr. Karabashev 
said. The Government should support those interests which are in 
defence of the national economy. 
  In response to a question, Mr. Matinchev denied having 
pursued at government level the interests of certain circles in 
the privatization of tourism, interested in the preservation of 
the old structure of this economic branch. This year 
privatization in tourism may yield revenues exceeding 2 billion 
leva, Mr. Matinchev said. 
  According to Mr. Karabashev, the government is to take 
measures for speeding up the process of privatization.

  [Text] Sofia, March 10 (BTA) -- The central exchange rate 
as of March 14, 1994 will stand at 62 percent and capitalized 
interest at an annual 83 percent. Interest on overdrafts on 
commercial bank current accounts with the central Bulgarian 
National Bank [BNB] as well as overdrafts on obligatory reserves 
will be calculated on a daily basis. The BNB yesterday raised 
the latter rates more than two-fold to 150 percent and 120 
percent, respectively. 
  The BNB decisions are intended to curb inflationary 
expectations, which got an unjustifiably strong boost recently, 
more specifically as a result of a sharp plunge of the national 
currency, the impending electricity price hike and an upcoming 
levy a value added tax, said central bank sources. A BNB 
release sent to BTA says the Governing Board is debating and may 
take other steps in the same direction. 
  "We are seeking to above all protect personal savings," said 
BNB Governor Todor Vulchev. The BNB is trying to protect the 
national currency and expects that necessary steps will be taken 
to boost production and the structural reform. International 
institutions are also expected to meet commitments to Bulgaria. 
The present measures are intended to prevent the soaring dollar 
exchange rate from reflecting on internal inflation, i.e. on the 
prices of goods on the home market, Vulchev said. [passage 
omitted] 
  In 1993 the central exchange rate was updated five times, 
hitting a year high in November (52 percent) and a year low in 
August (44 percent). This January it climbed to an all-time 
record of 56 percent, with the BNB struggling to head off 
speculative hyperinflation and encourage endangered personal 
savings.

  [Text] Prague, March 9 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic does 
not look at the Partnership for Peace proposal "in any different 
way" now Russia has expressed interest in the plan, Czech 
Premier Vaclav Klaus told journalists on Wednesday [9 March]. 
  Russia announced its interest in joining on February 28 
after 
consultation with NATO experts. 
  The Czech Republic respects the plan, Klaus said, adding 
that 
"our sole task is, along with NATO's member states, to fill the 
plan with something of substance." 
  "We understand the Partnership for Peace unambiguously as a 
mechanism of our strategical aim, which is the admission of the 
Czech Republic to NATO," he said. 
  Klaus is to sign a general agreement on Czech participation 
in the scheme in Brussels on Thursday. 
  The programme was approved at the NATO summit in Brussels on 
January 10-11 this year. Since then Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, 
Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia and 
Estonia have added their signatures to the project.

  [Text] Prague, March 7 (CTK) -- Partnership for Peace is 
the "maximum possible and the minimum desired" and is understood 
to be the first step on the way to full NATO membership, Czech 
Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said on Monday. 
  NATO needs to create the "backbone" [7 March] of a security 
system in Europe, where the changes taking place in the post- 
communist countries are creating a range of problems and 
conflicts whose consequences affect the whole continent, Baudys 
said in a lecture entitled "Security in Europe" at a conference 
organized by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. 
  Europe requires clearly defined security structures - and 
defined procedures for discussion, information exchange and 
authority - should these conflicts escalate, he said. 
  He said the Czech Army's cooperation this year with units 
from the French, German and Dutch armies should be taken only 
symbolically, because "we need to begin from the very bottom." 
  Joint military exercises are already being planned for next 
year in the framework of the Partnership for Peace programme, he 
said, adding that materials clarifying the legislative status of 
the exercises are currently being drawn up. 
  The Czechs have had bad experiences with international 
leagues and unions, he recalled. Czechoslovakia's first 
treaties and the Little Entente ended with the Munich Agreement 
in 1938, and following the Second World War membership of the 
Warsaw Pact was "forced on us." Baudys said he was certain the 
Czechs' association with NATO would be a different kind of 
experience.

  [Text] Prague, March 9 (CTK) -- There is no other 
possibility than to continue talks concerning joining Sidonia 
(located on the Czech-Slovak border) to the Czech Republic, 
Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus told journalists today. 
  He added that unilateral steps by one or the other side 
would 
not solve the situation. 
  Slovak Interior Minister Jozef Tuchyna told journalists on 
Tuesday that the Slovak Government disagreed with joining the 
settlement of Sidonia, in the village of Horne Srnie, to the 
Czech Republic as has been proposed by the joint Czech-Slovak 
commission dealing with the delimitation of the common border. 
  According to initial recommendations by the two countries' 
interior ministers the settlement U Sabotu should be joined to 
Slovakia and Sidonia to the Czech Republic. Given the fact that 
the Slovak Government yesterday did not approve the commission's 
proposal in its full wording, it is now up to the Czech and 
Slovak governments to solve controversial questions, Tuchyna 
said yesterday. 
  Slovak Government spokesman Ondrej Hanko told journalists 
Tuesday that the government had charged the commission with 
discussing other possibilities of compensation with the Czech 
side.

  [Text] Budapest, 9 March (MTI) -- The ethnic Hungarian 
minorities living outside of Hungary would gain the best chance 
for survival by being granted autonomy, Hungarian Democratic 
Forum (MDF) Chairman Lajos Fur told a rally at Salgotarjan, 
northern Hungary, tonight. 
  "Hungary's internal stability and international relations, 
drawing a protective net around the country, are insufficient 
for the security of the country. Nor is it sufficient to keep 
the Army on a level enabling it to defend the country. For the 
security of Hungary, appropriate conditions should be guaranteed 
for the survival of ethnic Hungarian communities abroad," Fur 
said. 
  The rally was attended by members of the MDF National 
Presidium and the cabinet.

  [Text] Budapest, 10 Mar (MTI) -- Thousands of people 
assembled this morning outside the Hungarian Radio building in 
Budapest's Pollack Mihaly Square to express their concern over 
the threat to a free press. 
  The demonstration was originally announced as a sit-in by 
the 
Independent Union of Radio Broadcasters (IURB), but the 
protesters could not sit down because the square was watered 
earlier by unidentified persons. 
  IURB president Laszlo Gyori said the demonstration was to 
show solidarity for the 129 radio employees summarily laid off 
on March 4. "This was a deliberate move by Hungarian Radio 
leaders against 129 employees and press freedom," he said 
  Miklos Gyorffy, a well-known radio journalist, said that the 
dismissed have the sympathy of many colleagues still in place. 
He stated the radio has been undergoing a political cleansing. 
"It is not democracy when all this can be done without any 
objections," he added. 
  Several speakers called for the resignation of Laszlo Csucs, 
the radio vice-president invested with full presidential powers. 
  Editor-reporter Jozsef Barath announced that the presidium 
of 
the National Association of Hungarian Journalists (NAHJ) on 
Wednesday decided to lodge a complaint against Csucs for paying 
public money to workers whom he does not allow to work. (The 
dismissed were given notices effective in 30 days, but they were 
suspended from their duties immediately.) 
  In addition, the NAHJ will initiate an ethical examination 
against those of its members who played a part in the cleansing. 
  Simultaneous with the nearly 90-minute-long protest, an 
organization calling itself the "Patriotic Committee for 
National Radio and Television" organized a counter-demonstration 
(a so-called "standing strike" in Pollack Mihaly Square for 
those "who want a national radio". 
  One of the counter-demonstrators (most of whom who were 
standing in small groups amid the crowd of protesters) argued 
that nobody demonstrated for the hundreds of thousands of people 
who have been laid off, nor did anybody speak out in parliament 
in their defence. The middle-aged man, who stood on the edge of 
the officially announced protest (which had previously been 
granted a permit) was shouting through a loudspeaker and 
disturbing the other demonstrators. Police drove him away from 
the square.

  [Text] Budapest, 10 Mar (MTI) -- Bucharest places 
importance on improving political and business links with 
Hungary in its bid for European integration, according to 
leaders of Hungary's main opposition party, the Alliance of Free 
Democrats (AFD), who returned from a three-day visit to Romania 
on Wednesday. 
  To Romania, the proper handling of national minority issues 
is important because this is a key issue of European 
integration, the AFD's prime minister candidate Gabor Kuncze and 
the party's foreign affairs expert Istvan Szent-Ivanyi told 
journalists on Thursday. 
  They also said problems forestalling smooth cooperation had 
come up at their talks with leading Romanian politicians. 
  The AFD believes that efforts to improve bilateral relations 
should be linked together with the cause of the minorities. 
  The Romanian negotiating party promised to open two border 
posts at Battonya and Mehkerek by the end of June. In accord 
with an earlier agreement between the two countries, Hungary has 
made all necessary arrangements for the new crossings, while 
Romania has done little so far. 
  The delegation also held talks with representatives of 
Romania's Democratic Hungarian Union (RDHU), county leaders from 
Harghita and Covasna (which have substantial Hungarian 
populations), Calvinist Bishop Laszlo Tokes and Catholic Bishop 
Jozsef Tempfli. The AFD delegates stated that should they be 
elected to government in May, they would retain all forms of 
support granted to Romanian Hungarians today. 
  The AFD agrees with the RDHU's position that Romania's 
efforts to achieve European integration are likely to 
necessitate the expansion of human and minority rights.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 11--Poland recognises the universal 
character of human rights but it also takes into account the 
specific character of individual situations and cultural 
differences, stated representative of the Foreign Ministry on 
Friday. He was referring to the criticism of Poland's position 
during the vote on Chinese motion on March 9 in Geneva not to 
adopt a resolution on human rights observance in China. Poland 
abstained. 
  Jan Woroniecki from the ministry said that Polish vote was 
not a decisive one as the Chinese motion was accepted by 20 
votes with 16 votes against. 
  According to Woroniecki, the situation in China is "very 
complex and remote from Poland." He added that China is a big 
country and any perturbations would mean different implications 
for international security. He also admitted that most probably 
China will not look upon the Polish abstention unfavourably. 
  The resolution on human rights observance in China was 
prepared by the European Union countries and aimed to stress the 
inadequate protection of religion, culture and ethnic identity 
of Tibetans and other minorities. Woroniecki recalled that last 
year when China lodged the similar motion, Poland voted against 
it. Poland stressed then that it can see changes in China and 
hopes they will continue.

Commission condemning the violation of human and civic rights in 
China." 
  During Wednesday's vote in Geneva on the Chinese motion to 
give up voting on the resolution demanding that human rights be 
observed in China, the polish delegate abstained. 
  "We demand a decisive change in the Foreign Ministry's stand 
on that issue as well as a policy that would prevent similarly 
discrediting actions from taking place in the future," a 
statement issued by the KLD said.

  [Text] Warsaw, Moscow, March 10--Deputy Chairman of the 
Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN) Adam Slomka termed 
as a move against Poland's reason of state the Sejm's rejection 
of the KPN's motion to include into its agenda the Foreign 
Ministry's information related to a planned visit to Poland by 
Russian nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. 
  Speaking at a press conference in the Sejm Thursday, Slomka 
pointed to deputies of the ruling coalition as those who had 
been against the motion. 
  On Wednesday, officials of the 1st Congress of the National 
Self- Defence (Samoobrona) front announced that Zhirinovskiy was 
expected to come to Warsaw on March 11 to attend a debate of the 
1st congress of the organization. 
  According to Zhirinovskiy's aides in Moscow, the leader of 
the Russian Liberal-Democratic Party has not reached a final 
decision related for his departure for Warsaw. "The decision is 
to be taken at the last moment", one of the aides said Thursday. 
  According to KPN spokesman Andrzej Mazurkiewicz, the Sejm 
majority's decision to reject the motion filed by his party in 
connection with Zhirinovskiy's visit means hiding the head in 
the sand and continuing "a bad policy of bowing down before a 
great Russia". 
  Slomka announced that the KPN will demand a Sejm debate 
related to a recent decision by Russian authorities to reduce 
natural gas supplies to Ukraine and Belarus. According to the 
KPN, the decision, ignored by major political forces in Poland, 
is a sign of imperialistic trends in Russia.

  [Text] Rzeszow, March 10 -- The Solidarity Trade Union and 
six centre-right parties in Rzeszow have struck a regional 
election agreement to cooperate in the forthcoming local 
government elections, the leaders of the groupings said on 
Thursday, claiming that "this is an alliance against the 
Democratic Left Alliance (SLD)." 
  The regional Non-Party Reform Bloc (BBWR) is seeking to join 
the group but the coalition members, including the Christian 
National Union (ZCHN), the Confederation For an Independent 
Poland (KPN), the Peasant Agreement (PL), the Movement For the 
Republic of Poland (RDR), the Peasant Christian Party (SLCH) and 
the Centre Alliance (PC), have put off the decision till next 
week. The coalition's hesitance is caused by its "reservation 
towards one of the Rzeszow leaders of this political 
association." 
  The agreement signatories are discussing the name of the new 
bloc and its election manifesto.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 10: The strike proclaimed by

Gdansk shipyard. Later, four other companies of the region 
staged the protest action as well. 
  In the afternoon, the employees of the Czestochowa Railways

  [Text] Warsaw, March 9 -- Former Senate Speaker Prof. 
Andrzej Stelmachowski on Wednesday told PAP that a declaration 
to set up the "Programme Centre" is an attempt to return to the 
roots of the Solidarity movement and that this new movement will 
draw on the Catholic Social Thought. 
  "Accepting unanimously, that the Catholic Social Thought is 
an ideological foundation of further works, the group will seek 
to formulate theses and a political, social and economic 
programme for all who adhere to Christian, democratic ideals and 
the concept of social solidarity," the Programme Centre 
declaration reads. 
  The new movement will not seek to become a party, and was 
born "out of concern resulting from the fact that elements of 
social justice are put to the back burner despite a government's 
shift to the left," Stelmachowski claimed. He argued that the 
ruling coalition has failed to present a concrete 
socio-political programme that would contain a clear vision for 
the future. 
  The centre intends to cooperate with the Solidarity clubs 
and 
other socio-political groupings in formulating its programme. 
Representatives of the "Solidarity" Union Mazowsze Chapter, the 
New Polish Right (NPP), the Party of Polish Democracy (SDP), the 
Christian Democratic Centre (CCD), the Movement for the Republic 
of Poland (RDR) and former activists of the Centre Alliance (PC) 
have responded to Stelmachowski's invitation to join the centre.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 9 -- Wojciech Jaruzelski told a Sejm

State if the Sejm decided he should do it. 
  "I will accept the Sejm's decision with full understanding 
and respect, and with the hope that the tribunal will be 
impartial, honest and just," said the general who introduced 
martial law in Poland on 13 December, 1981 after 16 months of a 
political showdown between the solidarity trade union and the 
communist authorities. 
  Today's session of the Sejm Committee for Constitutional 
Accountability was the first in a series of sessions during 
which Jaruzelski and other former politicians accused of 
implementing martial law will answer questions from MP's.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 9 -- Democratic Left Alliance Deputy 
(SLD) Andrzej Lipski declared during a Wednesday meeting of the 
SLD parliamentary floor group that the group of deputies who 
lost membership in the SLD caucus after a Saturday vote against 
the 1994 budget, will not join the opposition and will continue 
to support the SLD programme. 
  Four SLD members: Piotr Ikonowicz, Andrzej Lipski, Cezary 
Mizejewski (Polish Socialist Party -- PPS) and Stanislaw 
Wisniewski (All-Poland alliance of Trade Unions -- OPZZ) were 
expelled from the caucus after they violated the caucus 
discipline in the budget vote. 
  "I want to stress clearly that we are not forming an 
opposition. we will create the PPS circle, but we will still be 
supporting these activities of the cabinet, which will aim at 
the implementation of the SLD programme," said Lipski.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 11 (CTK) -- Former Deputy Premier 
Roman Kovac confirmed to CTK today that several parties had 
proposed he become the new Slovak premier. 
  The governing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) will 
"almost certainly" be addressed when the new government is 
formed, said Kovac, who was recently expelled from the HZDS 
following his criticism of former Premier Vladimir Meciar. The 
composition of the government will be decided within a week, he 
added. 
  Leader of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) Jan 
Carnogursky called September the most likely election date. "I 
hope parliament will pass the constitutional law setting the 
date for early elections in the autumn," he added. 
  Carnogursky ruled out the possibility that he would join the 
new government, adding that the idea that the cabinet be formed 
without political leaders was correct. 
  "A new cabinet can be formed within a few hours," former 
chairman of the Slovak National Party Ludovit Cernak said. "All 
the parties are ready to put an end to feuds and to agree on a 
broad coalition government which will lead Slovakia to early 
elections," he said. 
  "I believe ethnic Hungarian parties will not make 
extravagant 
claims because all the parties have pledged to set their own 
needs aside," Cernak said. He confirmed he respected the 
preliminary agreement providing for the absence of political 
leaders in the provisional government.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 11 (CTK) -- Outgoing premier 
Vladimir Meciar devoted a large part of his parting speech to a 
run-down of his cabinet's merits in bringing about Slovak 
independence. 
  He said that after the 1992 elections, his government took 
the reins of a country which found itself in a state of total 
collapse. He stressed that although the Czech side prepared for 
the split, the Slovak political and legislative leadership at 
the time did nothing of the sort. 
  After the 1992 elections, the government had to find a 
formula for a six-month coexistence of the two unitary republics 
within the federation, achieve a democratically-led split and 
create a new model of coexistence with the independent Czech 
Republic, he said. 
  "It has never been our intention to set up an iron-curtain 
frontier between our republics. We have always wanted and 
worked for cooperation," Meciar said, pointing out, however, 
that there were certain conflicts in the course of the division 
in the military and economic sectors. At the same time, he 
praised the accommodating approach of Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus 
as one enabling solutions to be found rapidly. 
  After the split, Slovakia he said inherited high 
unemployment 
and a large foreign debt, with the economic performance down 
over 30 per cent on 1992, and went on to deny his government's 
responsibility for the facts. 
  "We have solved 95 per cent of the federal property 
division, 
but you can criticize me for what's left," he said. 
  The government had to adopt immediate changes in the tax 
system and budgeting, pass many new laws and prepare currency 
separation, Meciar said. 
  "The cabinet's work schedule was punishing," he said in 
recognition of the cabinet members' efforts. Reflecting on the 
allegations that he exerted too much control, he said he had 
never had real power, but only what he called an infinite 
responsibility for the running of institutions which were only 
set up after Slovakia was founded. He said he gradually handed 
the responsibility over to them. 
  The birth of Slovakia took place amid favorable 
international 
but poor economic conditions, he said, defining the latter as 
the recession, loss of eastern markets and total lack of funds. 
He stressed that arms manufacturing has been willfully 
suspended and pointed out that it was being revived in the Czech 
Republic. 
  After the split, Slovakia managed to avoid all of the 
envisaged complications. It created its own currency in a 
fortnight, opened up foreign loan negotiations and has all but 
implemented the banking system. The rules of order, discipline 
and the law has taken root, he said, adding that foreign 
investors are showing signs of growing interest in the country 
and that transformation of agriculture is under way. "Can you 
tell us who else has achieved that?" Meciar asked, adding, "We 
did." 
  He also recalled government attempts at tapping Far Eastern 
markets. Describing the attempts as an unfinished process, he 
warned against their dismissal. 
  He pointed out that parliamentary political strife might 
result in slower transformation, delayed loans and pressure for 
more restrictive social measures. 
  "I feel the need to inform you about all this. You cannot 
destroy the continuity. There is a risk that in the second half 
of the year the social agreement may come at an end in 
Slovakia," Meciar warned.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 11 (CTK) -- After the dismissal 
of Vladimir Meciar's cabinet Roman Kovac is likely to become new 
Slovak premier, chairman of the opposition Christian Democratic 
Movement (KDH) Jan Carnogursky told CTK today. 
  He said the view was not held only by him, as Kovac's 
candidacy resulted from preliminary agreements of the opposition 
parties and groups in the case of the no-confidence vote in 
Meciar's government. 
  Until recently, Roman Kovac held the post of deputy premier. 
He was, however, dismissed by Meciar as he stood up against him.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 10 (CTK) -- A crowd of about 
three hundred supporters of Premier Vladimir Meciar, fearing his 
possible dismissal, has formed outside the Slovak parliament 
building, calling for the dismissal instead of his critic 
President Michal Kovac. 
  However, they are far from being the thousands who were 
expected and who came when Meciar was last dismissed from the 
premier's seat in 1991. 
  Since this morning parliament has been debating the motion 
of 
no confidence in the government proposed yesterday by the 
Christian Democratic Party (KDH). Most of the speeches so far 
have been made by deputies of the governing HZDS-SNS (Slovak 
National Party) coalition, condemning yesterday's speech by 
Kovac in which he fiercely criticized Meciar. 
  KDH chairman Jan Carnogursky said in the parliamentary 
corridors that the opposition was waiting for a speech by 
Meciar. "Then I shall make my appearance," he said. 
  HZDS deputy Ivan Luptak called for an agreement between HZDS 
and the Democratic Left Party (SDL) and for a compromise date of 
July for early elections. (The HZDS wants a June date, the SDL 
an autumn one). 
  However, he said it was unlikely that the HZDS and SDL would 
go into an open coalition before parliamentary elections, 
because the SDL wanted to share in the government only on the 
basis of new elections.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 9 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government 
strongly denounced the speech delivered by President Michal 
Kovac this morning in the Slovak Parliament. 
  "The Slovak Government is greatly concerned and offended by 
the speech of Mr President as it considers it a crude assault on 
the basic institutions of the new state," the governmental 
statement reads. According to the cabinet, Kovac's speech 
"harms Slovakia's reputation and position abroad and 
destabilizes the complicated domestic situation." 
  In the speech Kovac attacked Meciar's cabinet. 
  The government fundamentally rejects his address as 
confrontational and unprecedented, opposing European political 
standards, human ethics and overreaching the constitutional 
powers of the head of state. 
  The declaration notes that it was Meciar's government which 
had credentials for the creation of the independent states and 
bears most responsibility for its developments. In this 
connection the document poses the question "on behalf of whom 
and in whose interest Kovac's speech was said," noting that 
"certainly not in the interests of Slovak nationals." 
  The government is ready to acquaint citizens with a 
"thorough 
analysis" of Kovac's speech.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 9 (CTK) -- "I have known the 
president long enough and I would continue to respect him. 
However, I have mixed feelings about the personal attacks in 
his speech," the chairman of the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS) deputies group, Tibor Cabaj, said today. 
  Deputy premier and honorary chairman of the coalition Slovak 
National Party (SNS) Jozef Prokes called the speech of President 
Michal Kovac confrontational, saying Kovac should first have 
consulted with the government, at least about those parts in 
which he spoke about the country's situation. "The government is 
responsible for running the country, not the president," he said.

  [Text] Kosice, East Slovakia, March 10 (CTK) -- The speech 
given by Slovak President Michal Kovac on Wednesday is a "gross 
insult to parliamentary democracy," says a statement passed at a 
Thursday meeting of heads of district authorities. 
  Seventeen district heads and two government commissioners 
signed the document, also saying that Kovac's "reckless and 
false accusations" of Premier Vladimir Meciar and some members 
of the government "cannot be described as being other than an 
expedient aimed at destabilizing political situation and 
discrediting the government." 
  They said that Kovac's "attacks" addressed to State 
Secretary 
of the Privatization Ministry Ivan Lexa were a show of "vanity 
incompatible with the post held by Michal Kovac," and that in 
this way, Kovac detracts from the weight of his office. 
  The statement says that Kovac is playing into the hands of 
the forces which lost in the elections, were against the Slovak 
independence and work for its destruction.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 10 (CTK) -- The Slovak economy is 
undergoing a period of stabilization, Vice-Premier and Finance 
Minister Julius Toth told CTK today in response to the 
opposition's accusation in Parliament that the Government lacks 
a clear economic and financial policy. 
  Toth thus also refuted President Michal Kovac's criticism of 
the Slovak economy expressed yesterday in his speech. 
  All the important macroeconomic figures are changing 
systematically, Toth said. Only after they have been stabilized 
by the Government can a better economic policy be formulated, he 
added. An economic strategy does indeed exist; its principles 
were approved by the International Monetary Fund, he said. 
  The opposition "criminalizes" almost all the Government's 
economic decisions, he stated. Of course the Government cannot 
influence all business activity; it can only supervise it, he 
said in response to criticism to the effect that millions of 
crowns worth of hard currency payments have been leaking abroad, 
including to the Czech Republic. 
  He admitted that Slovakia has a trade deficit vis-a-vis 
Russia totalling 30 billion Slovak crowns ($910 million). 
  He reminded CTK that last year the Government lowered taxes 
on businesses by five percent and plans to lower them still 
further. 
  Vice-Premier for the Economy Sergej Kozlik said in defense 
of 
the Government that the U.S. foreign secretary praised Slovakia 
for keeping inflation under control, building up foreign 
currency reserves, and managing the budget deficit. Foreign 
investment last year rose by 60 percent as compared to the three 
preceding years.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 10 (CTK) -- The opposition 
Democratic Left Party (SDL) will support the dismissal of 
Vladimir Meciar's cabinet only if it receives sufficient 
guarantee that early elections will be held, SDL Chairman Peter 
Weiss told CTK today. 
  The SDL fears that if Meciar's government is dismissed, some 
parties will lose interest in the elections, he added. 
  "If people underestimate the need for new elections, they do 
not understand the depth of political crisis in Slovakia," Weiss 
said. The position of the SDL is influenced by the fact that 
some unnamed politicians are ignoring the need for elections for 
which the SDL has been calling for a year, he said.

  [Text] Bratislava March 11 (CTK) -- In the renewed debate 
on confidence in the Slovak Government this morning, Deputy 
Chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL) Milan Ftacnik called 
on Premier Vladimir Meciar to resign or for the debate to be 
ended. 
  "The discussion is clearly only being prolonged, and 
deputies 
are straying from the matter in hand," Ftacnik said, calling on 
the premier to "pluck up courage" and make a speech. If he did 
not, then it was "clearly time to end the debate." 
  Chairman of Parliament Ivan Gasparovic said in reaction to 
this that the debate could be ended if deputies stopped asking 
for permission to speak. Ftacnik's appeal was not passed as a 
formal motion, and the debate continues with a speech by Culture 
Minister Dusan Slobodnik on the theme of success in the 
increasing of Slovakia's profile and the necessity of the 
Bojnicky Altar being returned from the Czech Republic. 
  After Ftacnik's speech, Meciar went to sit next to Deputy 
Chairman of Parliament and SDL chairman Peter Weiss and started 
talking to him.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, March 10 (CTK) -- Pavol Kanis, a 
parliamentary deputy for the SDL [Party of the Democratic Left], 
confirms in the daily NARODNA OBRODA today that Meciar has 
offered him the post of Slovak president during talks between 
representatives of the SDL and the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS). 
  "During the talks important and unimportant things are said. 
I understood this offer as Meciar merely tossing out the 
possibility," Kanis says. 
  Asked why he did not put his signature under the proposal 
for 
a confidence vote in the government, which was signed by the 
majority of SDL deputies, Kanis says: "The SDL strategy places 
the decision on an early election date above other things, and I 
am bound to comply with the party strategy. I am expecting that 
others will also behave in harmony with the party's line," he 
adds. 
  Kanis says that the statement by Slovak National Party (SNS) 
Chairman Jan Slota that he could leave the government coalition 
to the benefit of the peace in the state could be described 
without exaggeration as "a statement by a real statesman."

  [Text] Bratislava, March 11 (CTK) -- In his speech to 
parliament before his resignation, Premier Vladimir Meciar 
denied President Michal Kovac's accusation that he had 
conditioned appointment of Ivan Lexa as privatization minister 
on to the procurement of money for the ruling HZDS (Movement for 
a Democratic Slovakia). 
  Even if the talks took place and were true, there is an 
unwritten rule that they are never talked about, claimed Meciar. 
  Meciar said that former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko had to 
travel to Croatia on Meciar's order to withdraw Kovac's promise 
of cooperation in arms production. 
  Kovac allegedly sent a letter to Taiwan promising to 
recognize it if Slovakia received $500 million. "This would 
cause an immediate political conflict with China. We were 
essentially opposed to it," Meciar said. 
  After the first talks with Czech President Vaclav Havel, 
Kovac requested that the Slovak government pay 18.2 billion 
Slovak crowns [Sk] ($550 million) for the National Property Fund 
(FNM) and Sk24 billion ($800 million) for the Czech deficit. "I 
disagreed with the request, and the shares worth Sk178.2 billion 
($5,400 million) eventually arrived in Slovakia gratis," Meciar 
added. 
  The meeting between the Slovak delegation and American 
President Bill Clinton, which was preceded by careful 
preparations, was a wasted opportunity, Meciar said. The talks 
with Clinton were a historic chance for Slovakia to resolve its 
security and economic interests. 
  Meciar said he had not had a chance to speak because Kovac 
delivered a 34-minute speech. The American party reacted 
negatively, as well. "I felt ashamed," Meciar commented on the 
meeting.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 11 (CTK) -- Premier Vladimir 
Meciar accused the army of the former Czechoslovak Republic of 
preparing an attack against Slovakia. 
  He said he deduced this from a talk with former 
Chief-of-Staff of the Czechoslovak Army Karel Pezl, during which 
negotiations on division of the state were underway. 
  He stated that he and Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus managed to 
resolve the situation politically. 
  "During a session of the federal army General Staff I asked 
Pezl whether he could give me a pledge that the staff officers 
were not preparing a military attack plan against Slovakia. He 
sweated something terrible and said he could not," Meciar 
reported. 
  "There are other indications as well that this had been 
contemplated," Meciar stated, adding that it does Klaus honor 
that they were able to resolve the problem within 24 hours.

<F P=106> ["Albanian Language Materials Censored in the FYROM" -- ATA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, March 9 (ATA) -- The Kosovar newspaper 
RILINDJA of March 8 reports that it expects some of the private 
radio and television stations broadcasting in Albanian in the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) to be closed down 
on the initiative of several of the government ministries. 
  The RILINDJA commentary says that this action is indicative 
of the FYROM decision to eliminate the Albanian language from 
the mass media. 
  In keeping with this policy, the Macedonian police recently 
confiscated 200 copies of SHKENDIA magazine published in Kosova 
at the border point between Kosova and the FYROM, in the 
vicinity of Jazhice. The confiscation was explained by saying 
that the educational nature of the magazine made it subject to 
censorship. According to the chief of the customs house, this 
magazine "must be read" before its sale can be permitted.

<F P=106> [Article by Prec Zogaj: "Hooligans Assault With a </F>
Knuckle-Duster Teodor Keko, Deputy and ALEANCA Editor in 
Chief--Procedures To Settle Accounts With Opposition Journalists 
Accelerated"] 
  [Text] Handcuffs, iron bars, and brass knuckles are the 
fringe benefits now awarded to journalists of the free and 
opposition press. A handful of prosecutors and ministers, and 
bandits and hooligans of the night, have closed ranks in the 
defense of Selami's model democracy, mercilessly striking out 
against journalists. This unprecedented political aggression 
reached an unexpected climax at about 2000 on Thursday evening 
[10 March]. Deputy Teodor Keko, one of the founders of the 
opposition press, a well-known writer, and for the last two 
months editor in chief of ALEANCA, was treacherously assaulted 
in the dark, close to the Tirana Prosecutor's Office and very 
near his own apartment. He had just emerged from his home, 
accompanied by his wife, when an unknown person emerged from a 
group of three that had taken up positions, and struck the 
deputy above the left eyebrow with a set of brass knuckles, 
causing three wounds with the weapon's three studs on the 
knuckles. Neither the deputy nor his terrified wife managed to 
learn anything about the three assailants, who ran away without 
a word, perhaps so as not to reveal their dialect. 
  The guards at the Tirana Prosecutor's Office and Deputy 
Prosecutor Fatos Dervusgu administered first aid to the deputy, 
who was sent to hospital, where he received the necessary 
treatment. 
  This shameful act against a deputy and a journalist 
represents an extremely dangerous escalation of this 
unprecedented violence against journalists. 
  One week ago, the Ton-Ton Macoutes of Shkoder delivered an 
almost fatal blow with an iron bar to Gjergj Zefi, deputy 
chairman of the Democratic Alliance's Assembly and an ALEANCA 
journalist, solely because he had denounced sections of the 
Shkoder mafia, those very same groups that are growing rich from 
smuggling oil and who were denounced the evening before last by 
Appeal Court Judge Zef Brozi. 
  Gjergj Zefi had not left his sick-bed before the forces of 
darkness planned another assault against editor in chief Keko. 
It seems that these forces that are today trying to strangle 
the country see it as more appropriate to settle accounts with 
ALEANCA with iron bars and brass knuckles. Otherwise, how can 
one explain that Keko was struck after taking over ALEANCA's 
editorial desk? He has immunity as a People's Assembly deputy. 
Any prosecution raised against him would involve contriving a 
case, assembling parliament in order to remove his immunity, and 
risking criticism from Europe and abroad, in other words, a long 
and dangerous road. In such cases, there are ways to accelerate 
the process. Hooligans, whether paid or unpaid, attack the 
journalist and deputy, and this achieves the same purpose. 
  In any case, even if common criminals who do not read 
newspapers did not receive orders to assault the journalist, 
their ominous daring has been inspired by the aggression of the 
state itself against the free press. Under such circumstances, 
we are faced with serious attempts at political assassination, 
in other words terrorism. Responsibility for these incidents, 
and others that will occur, fall squarely on the shoulders of 
the present government and the bodies of justice that are not 
taking a single step to protect journalists. 
  The ALEANCA staff issued a strong protest against the 
violence of the night-time streets and the fascist-style forms 
of revenge on opposition journalists. We appeal for the support 
of all our readers, citizens, policemen, prosecutors, and 
judges. It is not only Gjergj Zefi and Teodor Keko that have 
been assaulted today. The bars and brass knuckles struck their 
faces, but the blows were suffered by freedom of the press in 
Albania, without which a free and democratic society is 
unimaginable.

<F P=106> [Statement by Democratic Alliance issued in Tirana on 11 </F>
March: "Continuing Violence Against the Democratic Alliance 
Will Not Yield Results"] 
  [Text] At about 2000 on Thursday [10 March], several 
unknown persons assaulted Deputy Teodor Keko, member of the 
Democratic Alliance [AD] Presidency, editor in chief of ALEANCA, 
journalist, and writer. This incident is part of a long line of 
oppressive measures that the present government has undertaken 
against the political opposition and the independent and 
opposition press. For the AD in particular, this criminal act 
comes after the murder of Gjovalin Cekini, after the shameful 
organization of a defense for his murderers, after the assault 
on deputy editor in chief Gjergj Zefi, after dozens of incidents 
prepared in the offices of the ruling Democratic Party against 
the AD's work, and after attacks, insults, and slanders against 
the party's leaders. This latest activity of the Albanian 
Ton-Ton macoutes neither surprises us nor weakens us. As we 
have declared, the AD's members are ready to give their lives to 
establish democracy in Albania. They will die as Cekini did, if 
this is the price required, but they will never fall silent and 
they will continue to loudly denounce the police state that has 
been created in Albania. The AD does not protest against the 
state and asks for nothing from it, but issues a strong warning 
that the last stop on the road of crime is prison.

<F P=106> [Statement by Democratic Alliance Chairman Neritan Ceka, </F>
issued in Tirana on 11 March: "Criminals Hold the Real Power in 
This Country"] 
  [Text] The ugly crime against the deputy and editor in 
chief, Teodor Keko, was clearly of a political nature. It marks 
a further escalation of the strategy of violence against the 
Democratic Alliance [AD] and free speech that began in Shkoder 
with the murder of Gjovalin Cekini and the assault on Gjergj 
Zefi, and continued in Tirana with the arrest and persecution of 
journalists. 
  There is no doubt that the hand that struck Teodor Keko was 
one of those criminal hands that raised a toast in the tourist 
hotel in Shkoder with the odd Democratic Party leader. For us, 
this represents a caveman's reaction to the letter from the 
Cekini family published in ALEANCA two days ago. 
  An assault on a deputy in the middle of the street, in the 
presence of his own wife, shows that criminals hold the real 
power in this country. 
  As chairman of the second-largest opposition party, an 
intellectual, and a citizen, I demand a public statement by the 
president, the prime minister, and the Public Order Ministry 
concerning guarantees that they give for the normal conduct of 
political life in Albania. The opposition is here to ensure a 
democratic order, not to create a pretty facade for foreign 
delegations, behind which a corrupt and criminal state can 
operate. 
  Silence would be a disgrace, if not an incrimination, for 
any 
civilized politican.

the situation in Slovakia. 
  [Begin Havel recording] I do not agree with the view that 
what is happening now in Slovakia is of no concern to us. It 
does concern us very much. We cannot be indifferent if, in a 
neighboring state, which at the same time is so close to us, 
which is so firmly bound to us by innumerable threads, there is 
order or chaos, whether democracy is winning there or an 
authoritarian rule predominates. We cannot be indifferent to 
this. Therefore, I observe very tensely the developments there.

<F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with Czech President Vaclav Havel </F>
by station editor Eva Hulkova; "Conversations at Lany"--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Hulkova] Mr. President, the fact that the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic passed the vote of no 
confidence in Premier Meciar's government is undoubtedly event 
number-one. In a way, I would say that this is the development 
of paramount importance in Slovakia's recent history. 
  [Havel] It seems to be the culmination of a crisis that has 
been continuing on the Slovak political scene for some time now. 
It is difficult to know how it will develop. However, it is 
probable that early elections will take place, and, until then, 
it is to be hoped that some kind of lower profile but efficient 
government should be formed rather soon. I imagine this would be 
a semicaretaker government, one that would span the transitional 
period and contribute to calming the situation. This is in the 
interest of the Slovak citizens as well as of all of us who are 
not indifferent to developments in Slovakia. [passage omitted] 
  On the whole, let us hope that the situation in Slovakia 
will 
stabilize after the elections, which are evidently going to go 
ahead. Let us hope it will calm down and that Slovakia will 
embark on a true path of building a democratic political system 
and market economy. [passage omitted] 
  [Hulkova] Mr. President, I always thought that Slovak 
President Michal Kovac was unlikely to make a strong imprint on 
his country's history. But now I feel that his moment has come. 
After all, it is he who controls a lot of things. 
  [Havel] It should be said that I personally began to respect 
President Kovac because we often met and discussed in a very 
businesslike and frank manner various issues of interest. It 
should be said that President Kovac has developed into an 
outstanding and independent politician who acted when he felt it 
was his duty to act. What he did was very courageous and risky. 
What he did was not commonplace. No matter what the given 
constitutional system is, it is not usual that the head of state 
should enter into such open confrontation with the prime 
minister or the government. 
  Nevertheless, Mr. President Kovac probably knew what he was 
doing, and he knew why he was doing it. 
  [Hulkova] I have always been under the impression that 
speculation about further developments in Slovakia is at this 
time evidently premature. However, I would like to ask one 
question: Do you think that whatever happens next will be less 
clear than what happened in the past? Although we often 
disagreed with these developments, we knew what was taking place. 
  [Havel] It is true that Prime Minister Meciar, whom I know 
very well from the time of the [Czechoslovak] federation, is a 
very self-styled, original person with a special method of 
ruling. It is true to say that, if a modus vivendi or a contact 
is established with him, he is a politician who can be to a 
certain extent understood. Having said that, I do not claim he 
is the best possible politician. It is possible that the 
situation will become less transparent now because several new 
political groupings have been formed. The political stage 
became fragmented in a certain way. [passage omitted] 
  Much will depend on whether these new parties will manage to 
unite before the elections and create some kind of a wider 
formation with a clear policy or whether they will fight each 
other. Policy fragmentation is a great misfortune in political 
life. 
  [Hulkova] And one final question on Slovakia: In your 
opinion, is a third comeback of Vladimir Meciar possible? 
  [Havel] I would not like to make any prognosis in this 
matter. Really, I do not know, but anything is possible in these 
fledgling democracies. 
  [Hulkova] Mr. President, let us now recall your trip to the 
Vatican and Strasbourg at the beginning of this week. Deputy 
Foreign Minister Bratinka said it could not have been more 
successful. I would like to hear your personal view, if you 
care tell me, of the impressions you had. 
  [Havel] I find it difficult to answer this question, but, 
because you have asked, I have no choice but to say that in my 
view it was successful. I thought the second leg of the trip, 
the Strasbourg one, was particularly successful. [passage 
omitted] 
  As for my trip to the Vatican, my hour-long conversation 
with the pope was, as usual, very valuable for me because I have 
good rapport with the pope. The pope radiates a special sort of 
kindness and understanding, and one draws strength from this 
kind of conversation. But this would be a small reason for my 
going on a state visit there. The main thing is that the visit 
boosts our good relations with the Vatican. [passage omitted] 
  [Hulkova] Mr. President, you have already mentioned how much 
you valued the outcome of the Strasbourg leg of your trip. I 
would like to know whether you were at all worried about the 
reception of some passages of your speech by the deputies of the 
European Parliament? 
  [Havel] I was completely surprised at how favorable the 
reception of my address was. Afterwards, during various 
discussions and chats with deputies, including the gala lunch 
and so on, many chairmen or vice chairmen of the individual 
groups or committees told me that they were so swamped by the 
everyday technical and administrative duties they had to tackle 
that a certain overview and awarness of a deeper meaning of 
European integration and European union escaped them. They said 
they were very grateful to me for voicing this and for bringing 
up these points. They told me directly that they needed it. 
This pleased me, of course. [passage omitted]

  It is in the interest of the Czech Republic that Slovakia is

Government also needs a partner. This is why we hope that the 
Slovak Government crisis is quickly over. I would like to thank 
Prime Minister Meciar and the outgoing Slovak Cabinet for their 
correct attitude with regard to Czech-Slovak relations and, 
above all, for our joint patient search for constructive 
solutions in the tense moments when our common state was 
splitting.

  [Text] Jan Ruml, Czech minister of the interior has 
returned from his working visit to France. Jiri Bohacek asked 
him what he thought about the dismissal of Slovak Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar. 
  [Begin recording] [Ruml] Of late, we have in a way been 
expecting his dismissal. There is one thing I would agree with, 
which is that we need a strong government in Slovakia. It does 
not matter who represents this government. In this case, it was 
Meciar, whose government has been useful for the Czech Republic 
because any destabilization would put our market in Slovakia in 
jeopardy. Naturally, we need a stabilized partner in the East. 
Nevertheless, speaking from the future's point of view, I think 
that Meciar himself and all of his policies were departing from 
being focused on economic reforms and democratization. Speaking 
as a person who has been following the Slovak scene for some 
time, in the long term I regard this as a positive development. 
  [Bohacek] Minister, do you think that the dismissal of 
Slovak 
Prime Minister will be manifested in the problems related to the 
marking of the borders with the Slovak Republic? 
  [Ruml] It will, definitely. The main thing will be that the 
whole task will become more complicated and might even be 
stopped because territorial problems and border-related issues 
are political problems of extreme sensitivity, especially if 
they are made to be sensitive. Thus, in this situation, which 
has come to a head in Slovakia, I cannot imagine that we would 
discuss tiny areas of either Czech or Slovak territory. I think 
it will delay the work a little, but no dramatic changes are 
likely. We will wait and see what the next Slovak Government 
will be like, and we will set the negotiating process 
accordingly. [end recording]

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Bratinka has given to 
the Czech Radio his statement on the dismissal of Slovak Prime 
Minister Vladimir Meciar. 
  [Begin Bratinka recording] It is a decision of a freely 
elected parliament of a sovereign state and, as such, we must 
respect it, of course. 
  Right from the time of the rise of the two states that 
replaced the former Czechoslovakia, the Czech Republic pursued 
an entirely, almost scrupulously, correct policy vis-a-vis 
Slovakia. Relations between the two states have been very good, 
although certain problems in the sphere of trade appeared of 
late. There is no reason to think that the replacement of the 
prime minister could have a negative impact on mutual relations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec by Alena </F>
Borovickova; place and date not given: "Our Relations Are 
Special"] 
  [Text] Relations between the Czech Republic and Slovakia 
and the fundamental aspects of the Czech Republic's foreign 
policy were the main topics discussed in an interview granted to 
PRAVDA by Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec. 
  [Borovickova] It was often emphasized during the breakup of 
Czechoslovakia that very close, sui generis very special, 
relations will continue to exist between the Czech and Slovak 
Republics. This certainly applies in relations between people, 
but not at the government level. Can it be said that our 
relations are closer in some things--or different--from what 
they are with the Czech Republic's other neighbors? 
  [Zieleniec] I would even say that our relations are very 
close and special. I do not believe that this applies only to 
people and not to the governments. Not only relations between 
the individual ministries, but also between their individual 
employees are routine, something that, after all, is not typical 
in foreign political relations--for example, in our relations 
with Poland and Hungary. I am not even talking about more 
distant countries. Almost all communication between governments 
is held via the foreign service. This is not the case in our 
relations. The intensity of the links between the two countries 
in the economic, legal, social insurance, health insurance 
spheres, and so forth is unique. In essence, it is possible to 
say that we have succeeded in maintaining for the long-term the 
things that, following the breakup of the state, were special 
and very important for the practical lives of our citizens: 
Their status with regard to the citizens of the other state, 
employment opportunities, and the possibility of unrestricted 
movement. You can cross our common border, although we have 
technical problems with it, wherever and whenever you like, even 
in a forest. It would be difficult to find something like this 
anywhere else in Europe. However, because our relations are so 
remarkable and close, there are also problems. 
  [Borovickova] Is there any coordination of stances on major 
international issues between the Czech and Slovak Foreign 
Ministries? For example, you have the Sudeten Germans and we 
have the Carpathians.... 
  [Zieleniec] The kind of coordination you are talking about 
is engendered because we have a common interest in many areas. 
Our national interests and the national interests of Slovakia 
logically coincide. We lived for a long time in a common state 
and we inherited many commitments. Our nations are close to 
each other, and they feel an affinity and affection for each 
other. All of this is projected into what is called state or 
national interests. It is of fundamental interest to the Czech 
Republic that Slovakia is democratic and prosperous and that it 
has the same foreign policy orientation as the Czech Republic. 
That is, an orientation toward Western Europe. This is also 
prompted by simple geopolitical reasons. It is good to have 
friends for neighbors. 
  [Borovickova] Do you believe in the existence of spheres of 
influence in present-day Europe? 
  [Zieleniec] Not only do I believe this, but I am convinced 
that, as it was for centuries, so will it be in the future. 
Europe--Central Europe, in which we live--is the object of the 
power-wielding interests of various states and powers. This is 
something that we have been very well aware of in the past 45 
years. This is something that we know we will have to face in 
the future. The issue, however, lies in ensuring that we orient 
our state in the long term toward political cooperation with 
those countries with whom we have a similar scale of values and 
with whom we share the same way of life. This is a matter that, 
in this context, is very important; and, for us, this is 
indubitably Western Europe. 
  [Borovickova] In this context, what is your view of Russia? 
  [Zieleniec] Russia is a large country, a power, even a 
superpower. It is a country that has played and will continue 
to play a very important role in the history of Europe and the 
world. It is important for us that it succeeds in becoming 
stabilized and that a parliamentary democracy, a market economy, 
and an efficient economy is asserted there; this is also a 
prerequisite for political stability in this huge country. 
Incidentally, this is not only what we want; it is also what 
the Russian democrats want. 
  [Borovickova] What is your assessment of Czech-Austrian 
relations in view of the completion of "undesirable" Temelin? 
  [Zieleniec] This is a time-sensitive issue. Discussions are 
under way on more finance for it. This is also an issue of some 
significance on the Austrian domestic political scene. 
Elections are coming up. I do not think this issue can have a 
long-term influence on Czech-Austrian relations, which are very 
good. We have historical ties to Austria, there are ties 
between our people, and I believe that not only Austrian 
politicians, but also Austrian citizens are aware of this. 
  [Borovickova] Do you know how many of the staff in your 
ministry are Slovak nationals? 
  [Zieleniec] We place no emphasis on nationality. We have an 
unequivocal criterion--citizenship. Naturally, it is a 
condition that we employ only Czech citizens in our diplomatic 
services. 
  [Borovickova] So, Slovak nationality plays no role even in 
the decisionmaking on appointments to senior posts? 
  [Zieleniec] Take a look around the ministry and you will see 
that we pay no attention to this. 
  [Borovickova] Since we are talking about nationality, you 
are of Polish origin, your deputy, Mr. Bratinka, is of Slovak 
origin, and it is rumored that Mr. Vondra is of Hungarian origin 
and was called Csapo. Is this true? 
  [Zieleniec] I do not know. I acknowledge my Polish origin. 
Whether Mr. Bratinka derives his origin from the fact that he 
was born in Slovakia, I do not know. As far as Mr. Vondra is 
concerned, I simply do not know. You see, we do not bother 
about this.... 
  [Borovickova] How do you feel as foreign minister in a 
state where, apart from yourself, foreign policy is also 
"formulated" by the Office of the President of the Republic, the 
chairman of the parliamentary Foreign Committee, the prime 
minister, and recently also the defense minister, while not all 
of them always agree with one other? Do you manage to sleep 
peacefully? 
  [Zieleniec] I have been sleeping peacefully since childhood. 
If you look at our Constitution, you will see that there are 
many constitutional officials in the Czech Republic who have 
authority in foreign policy. We are not an exception, however. 
It is the same elsewhere. The authority is different, but it 
exists. Therefore, foreign policy is the result of cooperation 
among these officials. The problem is in coordinating these 
issues, in preventing aberrations. This is my job; at least, 
this is what I am trying to do. It does not always succeed, but 
I think some progress is being made here. We meet regularly 
with those constitutional officials you mentioned, and we 
discuss key foreign policy issues. If you look at Germany, 
Austria, or the United States, there are also more 
constitutional officials active in foreign policy there. Their 
opinions are not unanimous. Each one emphasizes a slightly 
different point of view, depending on his constitutional 
function. If there were only one opinion, it would be like it 
was under communism. People now have the opportunity to look a 
little deeper into the process of the evolution of political 
opinion. By the way, even in Slovakia this opinion is not 
unanimous. 
  [Borovickova] There is currently a great deal of discussion 
about the Walderode case. Mr. Bratinka recommended to the 
Interior Ministry some time ago the names of several individuals 
who are "worthy of special consideration" from the point of view 
of speeding up the process of granting them Czech citizenship. 
Was this preceded by discussions at your ministry. or was this 
his own initiative? 
  [Zieleniec] First of all, Mr. Bratinka did not recommend Mr. 
Walderode to anyone. He did write a letter to the Interior 
Ministry containing several names, but Walderode was not one of 
them. When he wrote this letter, Mr. Bratinka was entrusted 
with running the section whose authority also included 
expressing an opinion on domestic political issues from the 
foreign policy point of view. It is necessary to view his 
recommendation within the framework of the normal procedure 
between individual state administration bodies in the Czech 
Republic. The Agriculture Ministry expresses an opinion from 
its point of view, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs from 
the point of view of its jurisdiction, and the Foreign Ministry 
from its point of view. The final decision fell to the Interior 
Ministry, and it made it. I think that the whole case has been 
blown out of proportion, especially the attestation that Deputy 
Bratinka provided. 
  [Borovickova] These "aristocratic" cases are juxtaposed in 
the Czech media with the Volhynian Czechs. What is your opinion? 
  [Zieleniec] I do not view this as an extraordinary course of 
action. I think we have to view this as a normal civil 
procedure, regardless of whether someone has a name that was 
once aristocratic. According to the law in our country, the use 
of aristocratic titles is prohibited, and everyone is equal 
before the law, whether he is the descendant of a famous 
aristocratic family or a Volhynian Czech. The problem is 
something else. It is associated especially with property 
restitution, and this concerns the former group of people. The 
issue of the Volhynian Czechs involves mass citizenship, and I, 
as a citizen, am of the opinion that, because we are a civic 
state, these issues should be resolved individually. It is 
necessary to view each applicant as a potential citizen of this 
state. 
  [Borovickova] How did Moscow crop up in your curriculum 
vitae? 
  [Zieleniec] I was born there because, at that time, my 
parents were working in Moscow. I was there for three months. 
  [Borovickova] You are going to Bratislava on Friday [11 
March]. What will you do there inasmuch as you do not have a 
counterpart? 
  [Zieleniec] I am going privately at the invitation of the 
Slovak Foreign Policy Association. 
  [Borovickova] Can you tell us anything more about this? 
  [Zieleniec] I will deliver a lecture on the Czech Republic's 
foreign policy. This is not an official visit. I do not have 
any extraordinary meetings planned.

<F P=106> [Interview with Milan Hulik, a member of the Democratic </F>
Union (DEU) preparatory committee, by Pavel Verner; place and 
date not given: "The Democratic Union Is To Draft More Detailed 
Statutes"] 
  [Text] Milan Hulik is a member of the preparatory 
committee of the DEU, a right-wing party that is aiming to 
emerge on the Czech political scene. Following the failed 
attempt to register the party with the Czech Interior Ministry, 
he indicated in the press his suspicion of deliberate 
obstruction on the part of the ministry. 
  [Verner] Do you really believe that it is someone's 
deliberate wish not to register your party? 
  [Hulik] I do not expect a direct intention in this sense. 
The registration has probably failed because of the character 
of our statutes that are extraordinary, creative, and not copied 
from other political entities. In particular, it is our way of 
election and appointment. The ministry asked for more details. 
We will comply. 
  [Verner] As far as I know, you also had applications that 
were not completely filled out and that does not correspond to 
the registration rules.... 
  [Hulik] We gathered 1,000 signatures in two days. After our 
appeal, the people came again to add the missing data; so, that 
is all in order. 
  [Verner] Are the secrets regarding the program objectives of 
the DEU necessary? 
  [Hulik] We have published them in outline. Regarding 
detailed information, certain individual actions--for instance, 
our forged statutes are circulating in Prague--force us to be 
careful. 
  [Verner] Whose individual actions? 
  [Hulik] Messrs. Kulhavy for the Conservative Party and Samek 
for the Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen's Party, for example, who 
expected that they would join the DEU in some official capacity. 
They were bringing radicalism into our program; they founded a 
shadow government, and, when they did not meet with 
understanding, they began to set up the so-called New Right Wing. 
  [Verner] What about the relationship between the DEU and the 
KAN [Club of Nonaligned Activists]? 
  [Hulik] If you have the leadership of the KAN in mind, their 
relations toward us are based on sad envy. They reproach us for 
stealing the program, the principles of which existed long 
before KAN; they are general and cannot be the property of a 
single political party.

  [Text] We want this to become the beginning of our 
relations between Russia and Poland, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], said 
about his visit to Poland. 
  [Andrzej Kruszynski] Speaking at the deliberations of the 
Self-Defense National Front, at whose leader's, Janusz 
Bryczkowski's, invitation Zhirinovskiy came to Poland, the 
Russian politician sent a message to Polish politicians saying 
that Poland can have in Russia a real help in the implementation 
of its national interests. Denying all interference in the 
internal affairs of our country, the main body of Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy's address was aimed at convincing the Poles about 
the benefits ensuing from close economic and political ties of 
the whole Slavonic commonwealth, not excluding a military 
treaty. Such a commonwealth can become the greatest power in 
the world, the Russian politician added. 
  There were also anti-Western accents in his address. In 
Zhirinovskiy's opinion, the West would be happy to see enmity 
amongst the Slavs. This is Andrzej Kruszynski speaking for the 
First Program of Polish Radio.

  [Text] Warsaw, 12 Mar--According to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
the party he is leading has already had a number of achievements 
in the Russian parliament. As a result of his influence, 
Russia's internal policy has been changing, the bombing of 
Serbia has been prevented, and an amnesty has been declared, 
among other things. 
  At a news conference in Warsaw on 12 March, the leader of 
the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] of Russia pointed out that 
Russian policy was changing according to the ideas put forward 
by this party. He said that Yetsin "had to take into account 
the results of the parliamentary elections", in which the LDP 
gained the support of 25 percent of the electorate. 
  Enemies of a strong state, among whom Zhirinovskiy includes 
Gaydar, Fedorov, and Burbulis, are being removed from the 
government. He stressed that he hoped that Kozyrev and Shakhray 
would leave the government by the beginning of June. "Russia 
will celebrate when it gets a new minister of foreign affairs," 
Zhirinovskiy said, when asked to comment on Kozyrev. 
  The LDP leader wishes the present president of Russia to be 
able to survive to the end of his term in office, although, as 
he stressed, it may also happen that elections will take place 
earlier than planned--that is, in 1996. "If members of the 
electorate retain their current affiliations, I shall be able to 
win the elections," Zhirinovskiy said. 
  He emphasized several times that his aim was to build a 
strong Russia. He came out in favor of a free Europe, a Europe 
of many partners free of any political or military pressures. 
"I am not threatening anyone, but I am warning that, if there 
is any danger to Russia, I shall harden my policies," he said. 
If he becomes president, he will, in case of "a mortal" danger 
to Russia's national interests, use all of the possibilities, 
"not excluding nuclear weapons." 
  Zhirinovskiy expressed his "categorical protest" against the 
use of foreign armed forces to solve conflicts, as, for example, 
in the former Yugoslavia: "Everyone should solve his problems 
himself; nobody should impose his precepts." 
  When asked about his earlier statements, in which he 
questioned Poland's borders (among other things, he mentioned a 
joint Russian-German border), he said that "the best border 
between Russia, Poland, and Germany is the sea border--the 
Baltic Sea."

  [Text] Warsaw, 13 Mar--On Sunday, the second day of 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's visit to Poland, the leader of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia went to visit the Grunwald 
battlefields (Olsztyn province), where he laid flowers in front 
of the Grunwald monument. He was accompanied by Janusz 
Bryczkowski, chairman of the Polish National Front. 
  "I am laying flowers on the soil where for centuries 
Germans, 
Poles, and Russians fought battles. Grunwald was a joint 
Polish-Russian victory," Zhirinovskiy said, pointing out that 
Smolensk battalions took part in the battle. 
  When asked by journalists to whom the former East Prussia 
should belong, Zhirinovksiy said that "the borders were 
determined 50 years ago as a result of blood shed by Polish and 
Russian soldiers, and these territories belong to Poland." 
  Zhirinovskiy said that there is enough room "along the 
Baltic 
for everyone--the Germans, the Poles, and the Russians." 
  This morning, before his departure for Olsztyn province, 
Zhirinovskiy took a walk in Warsaw's Lazienki Park and the 
Castle Square. Together with Janusz Bryczkowski, he laid 
flowers in front of the Warsaw Uprising monument.

<F P=106> [From the "Panorama" newscast--relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia </F>
Network in Polish] 
  [Text] [Announcer Martin Zimoch] Dariusz Rossati, the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] candidate for the post of deputy 
prime minister for economic affairs and finance minister, has 
flown in from Geneva. Tomorrow, he is to meet with Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak, who will decide after this talk 
whether he will entrust Professor Rossati with the vacant posts 
in the government. 
  [Begin recording] [Rossati] The point, above all, is to 
avoid 
misunderstandings later. So, I judge that it is good to clarify 
all of the matters that might become subjects of dispute before 
the decision is made on the subject of a possible nomination. 
So... 
  [Unidentified correspondent interrupting] What matters might 
these be, in your view? 
  [Rossati] Well, I judge that it is necessary to very clearly 
specify the prerogatives of the deputy prime minister for 
economic affairs because, probably, the past has shown that, 
well, if there is a lack of this, that is a precise 
specification of prerogatives, and certain misunderstandings 
might ensue on certain matters. And another matter is the 
assurance of some sort of good day-to-day cooperation with both 
the prime minister and the remaining members of the government. 
Well, for this it is necessary to set some sort of procedure 
for contacts, meetings. I think that these are not matters that 
cannot be determined. 
  [Correspondent] The case of the Foreign Indebtedness 
Servicing Fund [FOZZ]? 
  [Rossati] I judge that this is obvious. If one carries on 
investigative proceedings in such a case as that of the FOZZ, it 
is necessary to seek the views of, or to interview, all the 
people who can bring something into the case, who know something 
about the case. It is just that I am surprised that this is 
being spoken of only two and half years after the investigation 
was begun. So, in my view, the choice of this moment is, well, 
not a coincidence. [end recording]

Radio and for the Polish Press Agency, Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak said that the overall demands of Solidarity were 
justified but could not be achieved through strikes: 
  [Begin Pawlak recording] When we look at these demands, 
these general demands concerning, for example, an increase in 
real wages, I have to say that I, too, am in favor of the 
implementation of these demands. The [word indistinct] of 
putting forward such a demand is perhaps very big, and the 
general, noble, intention is very visible, but afterwards it has 
to be implemented. We want, through our actions, to bring about 
the implementation of this intention. When we speak of limiting 
the growth of energy carriers, I, too, am in favor of such a 
solution. In this budget, we can already see a visible decrease 
in the growth rate of energy prices in comparison with what had 
been planned as late as in the second half of last year or 
compared with the growth rate of prices that were implemented 
last year. 
  I would like to remind you that our government limited these 
price increases, and it seems to me that the difference between 
us here lies in how to implement these demands successfully. I 
am also in favor of implementing them. As I have said, however, 
if we were to discuss and compete on the level of ideas as to 
how to do this better and more quickly, it would certainly be of 
benefit to us all. I would encourage the holding of such a 
discussion and such a debate. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by A.F.T., B.C.: "Prime Minister Invites to Talks: </F>
Solidarity Gives Up a `Major Blow' for Now"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak plans on 
having working meetings with four trade union leaders on Friday, 
18 March. On Saturday night [12 March], he issued invitations 
to Marian Krzaklewski (Solidarity), Ewa Spychalska (All-Polish 
Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ]), Marian Jurczyk (Solidarity '80), 
and Jan Kisielinski (Polish Miners' Trade Union). 
  Yesterday, members of the National Protest Headquarters met 
in Katowice in order to make a decision on what Solidarity's 
action should consist of and to take a stand on the prime 
minister's proposal. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said after 
Saturday's meeting of the Council of Minister's Economic 
Committee and the Council of Minister's Social and Political 
Committee: "We were pondering the phenomenon of the situation 
where both the government and Solidarity are declaring their 
willingness to conduct talks, but still, such talks are not 
taking place. And that is why we came to the conclusion that it 
would be a useful thing if a representative of the government, 
who would be of a high rank appropriate for that or even of the 
highest rank, could talk to a representative of the Solidarity 
trade union, who would have been given sufficient powers, and 
the purpose of the meeting would be to determine what kind of 
procedural obstacles are preventing a meeting from taking 
place." When asked about whether the government intends to 
conduct separate negotiations with Solidarity, Cimoszewicz 
replied: "Substantive negotiations aimed at arriving at 
mutually agreed conclusions must be taking place with all trade 
unions, just the way Solidarity wanted it to be when it 
initiated the idea of establishing a Trilateral Commission." 
  Addressing an accusation by the General Administration of 
State Railroads that the railroad strike was illegal, the prime 
minister admitted that "procedures required by the law make it 
practically impossible to organize a legal strike." 
  Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski says that the prime 
minister's proposal is a "kind of opening up, but it also has 
flaws." According to the chairman, because it is Solidarity 
that is involved in collective bargaining with the government, 
the trade union should sign an agreement on its own behalf. 
  Solidarity's National Protest Headquarters, which held a 
session on Sunday [13 March], accepted an invitation to talks 
issued by Prime Minister Pawlak, but the trade union does not 
regard the talks as a formal initiation of negotiations. 
Because the government has so far failed to reply to the trade 
union's demands, which were submitted in mid-February, the trade 
union's protest action will continue: Protests in Wroclaw, 
Opole, and Walbrzych have been announced for Monday, strikes in 
several plants of the Bydgoszcz Region have been announced for 
Tuesday, and, beginning Thursday (in connection with the 
initiation of proceedings regarding a new law on popiwek [tax on 
excessive salary increases] ), picketing in front of the Sejm 
building will begin. But, for the moment, Solidarity has given 
up a combination of the protests and a "major blow," which had 
been planned before. 
  Krzaklewski did not reveal the amount of financial resources 
collected for a strike fund because that information is secret. 
He announced that Solidarity will initiate more collective 
bargaining, dealing with the government's failure to implement 
the "Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises" over the past year. 
  According to OPZZ Deputy Chairman Waclaw Martyniuk, given 
the 
"current tension and the general situation," the prime 
minister's meeting with trade unions' chiefs is a logical thing. 
In his view, the talks will concern the "establishment of the 
Trilateral Commission." Marian Jurczyk will respond to the 
prime minister's invitation. For the chairman of "Solidarity 
'80," "economic revival is a fundamental issue. Jan Kisielinski 
would first of all like to discuss problems faced by the mining 
industry (including his alternative proposal to the program of 
restructuring the mining industry), and also issues associated 
with the Silesia region.

  [Text] The agreement negotiated by Poland with the London 
Club means a reduction of more than 45 percent on a debt that 
amounts to $13.2 billion. The repayments of the debt are to 
last 30 years. They will not exceed $400 million a year. 
During the first five years, the repayments will be lower and 
will increase after 2009, when the servicing of debts owed to 
governments of creditor countries assembled in the Paris Club is 
to come to an end. 
  The agreement embraces all of the constituent parts of the 
debt: long- and medium-term credits, outstanding interest, and 
the short-term revolving credit. 
  [Correspondent Krystyna Koziol] The agreement with the 
London 
Club on a reduction of our debt, negotiated by Poland during the 
night, is a very important event for Poland, said Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak at a news conference devoted to this matter and 
held at the Office of the Council of Ministers. 
  Several governments worked to achieve this success, as well 
as many politicians and experts, added the prime minister. He 
stressed that the agreement with the London Club brought to an 
end the restructuring process of our foreign debt. This event, 
said the prime minister, will have a significant influence on 
our economic situation. 
  Acting Finance Minister Henryk Chmielak stressed that, in 
negotiations with our creditors associated in the London Club, 
we achieved the goals we had set ourselves: We had lowered the 
costs of servicing of our debt, adjusting them to our 
capabilities. And the second important goal achieved was a 
reduction of our debt, comparable to that granted us by the 
Paris Club. 
  The results of the negotiated agreement, emphasized Minister 
Chmielak, are fully satisfactory. With this agreement, we have 
achieved a full normalization of our financial relations with 
the West. This is a sign for Western investors that investing 
in Poland is growing more attractive. 
  Deputy Finance Minister Krzysztof Krowacki, government 
plenipotentiary in talks with banks, underlined that the 
repayments of the debt were to take 30 years and would not 
exceed $400 million per year. In many regards, said Minister 
Krowacki, the main negotiator of the agreement, we have obtained 
better conditions than those we received from the Paris Club. 
The agreement that this reduction would also apply to 
outstanding interest is without precedent, he added. 
  And one more thing: Until now, because of our debt to the 
London Club, our daily interest grew to the tune of $2 million. 
From 20 March, on the basis of the agreement, this growth will 
decrease by 45 percent.

  [Text] The morning of Bairam [Muslim holiday] in Bihac has 
started with heavy artillery attacks by chetniks from the nearby 
hills on all parts of the town, especially on Prekounje district 
and the industrial zone, as well as on the suburbs. Shells were 
fired from tanks, howitzers, and mortar-launchers. There is no 
peace on the front lines either. Since early this morning shell 
explosions and small-arms fire can be heard from this direction. 
  Fighters of the Bosnian Army's V Corps and members of the 
Internal Affairs Ministry and the Croat Defense Council are 
successfully repelling all attacks by aggressors who have been 
trying to break through our fighters' defense lines for over a 
month without success. 
  By the time of this report we have not received information 
on any casualties in this morning's attack. The shelling of the 
town and the suburbs stopped when NATO planes were seen flying 
above. The same happened during the night when NATO planes were 
swarming the skies above Bihac.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 13 (AFP)--Two teams of 10 UN 
military observers each arrived Sunday evening [13 March] in the 
besieged Moslem enclave of Maglaj, a United Nations Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman said. 
  Their arrival marks the first time the United Nations has 
had 
a presence in this Moslem enclave, which has been besieged by 
Bosnian Serb forces since last June, said spokesman Major Rob 
Annink. The spokesman did not provide further details. 
  UN officials have been unable to confirm reports of the 
latest round of fighting in Maglaj as there have been no 
international observers there. 
  In addition, UN humanitarian aid has been blocked from 
Maglaj 
since October. Western concern has grown about Maglaj as Serb 
attacks are continuing there despite ceasefires in Sarajevo and 
central and southern Bosnia. 
  A UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) convoy was 
refused passage into Maglaj last week by Serb troops. 
  UNHCR officials have said the situation in Maglaj is 
desperate, with attacks mounting on the 16,000 people in the 
town since Serbs and Moslems reached a ceasefire in Sarajevo 
February 11 and since a Moslem-Croat ceasefire in central and 
southern Bosnia came into effect on February 28. 
  Radio Sarajevo reported that Serb forces began as of 5:30 
A.M. Sunday (0430 GMT) artillery and mortar attacks on the 
enclave that lasted for two hours. There was then sporadic 
mortar fire. Two people were wounded, it said.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 14 (TANJUG)--Russian president 
special envoy Vitaliy Churkin arrived here Monday morning on a 
very sensitive mission during which he will explain to 
representatives of the Bosnian Serb Republic how Moscow, but 
also Washington, view the position of Bosnian Serbs following 
the agreement between Bosnian Muslims and Croats to form a 
federation, and to obtain a definite response from the Serbian 
side. 
  Before arriving here, Churkin performed intense shuttle 
diplomacy in search of a solution to the Bosnian conflict. 
  In London he met with Charles Redman, special envoy of 
President Clinton, in Zagreb he held talks with Croatian 
President Franjo Tudjman, in Sarajevo with Muslim leader Alija 
Izetbegovic, and in Pale he was received by Momcilo Krajisnik, 
Bosnian Serb Republic speaker. 
  According to Churkin the federation between Bosnian Croats 
and Muslims does not "necessarily run contrary" to the interests 
of Bosnian Serbs and could form part of an overall settlement of 
the Bosnian conflict. 
  In Pale (the seat of the government), Momcilo Krajisnik told 
Churkin that Serbs have no reason to unite with Croats and 
Muslims. 
  In Churkin's opinion, Serbs should be connected with the 
Croat-Muslim federation by a weak link, maybe a union. 
  A definite response, it has been announced in Pale, will be 
given to Churkin in Belgrade on Monday, where he is due to meet 
in the afternoon with Bosnian Serb Republic Vice-President 
Nikola Koljevic, it has been learnt from unofficial sources. 
  It is expected that Churkin will be received by Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday. 
  Bosnian Muslims and Croats have reached an agreement to form 
a Croat-Muslim federation, which would later form a 
confederation with Croatia. This concludes the first phase of 
the latest peace process on Bosnia according to the U.S. 
scenario. 
  The second phase, the Americans assess, will necessarily 
lead 
to the involvement of Bosnian Serbs. Evidently it is Churkin's 
job to see to it that Bosnian Serbs get involved in the second 
phase. 
  Bosnian Serbs have apparently once again come under strong 
diplomatic, but also military, pressure. The goal is to find a 
place for them in the future organization of the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This however means that Bosnian 
Serbs are expected to make the biggest concessions, both 
political and territorial. 
  Washington's concept is, by a maneuver of a dual Muslim 
state, to secure the continuation, albeit partial, of a unitary 
Bosnia, to extend the territory under Muslim control, and to 
secure for them an outlet to the sea and finally to create a 
strong negotiating block (and if possible a military one) 
against Bosnian Serbs in the coming phase. 
  Political analysts consider that by this initiative 
Washington attempts to isolate once again Bosnian Serbs and 
exert pressure on them in order to obtain territorial 
concessions more easily at the negotiating table.

  [Text] Belgrade, Mar 13 (TANJUG)--Military disengagement 
between Bosnian Moslems and Serbs could start in Maglaj, town in 
northern Bosnia, the special Russian envoy to the former 
Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin said Sunday. 
  Churkin said he had discussed Sunday in Sarajevo with 
Bosnian 
Moslem Leader Alija Izetbegovic the possibility of taking 
advantage of the recent positive developments between Moslems 
and Croats to apply the experience also between Moslems and 
Serbs to get them to disengage their forces and perhaps place 
heavy weapons under control, FRANCE PRESSE reports. 
  Serbs, Moslems and Croats have been waging a bitter war in 
the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina since April 
1992. With U.S. mediation, Bosnian Moslems and Croats signed an 
agreement in Washington earlier this month on forming a 
federation in Bosnia- Herzegovina which would later form a 
confederation with neighbouring Croatia, also a former Yugoslav 
republic. 
  The possibility of the third warring party joining the 
federation remains open. 
  After signing the Washington agreement, Croat and Moslem 
military representatives ratified it Saturday in Split and 
signed a document on the formation of a joint army. 
  According to a UPI report, after a one-hour talk with 
Izetbegovic, Churkin pointed out that Sarajevo must remain 
undivided. 
  Bosnian Serbs and Moslems, he said, must put aside their 
political differences and start working on restoring 
electricity, running water, transportation and other services in 
Sarajevo. 
  According to Churkin, the federation between Bosnian Croats 
and Moslems is not necessarily contrary to Bosnian Serb 
interests and could be a useful element of the overall 
settlement of the Bosnian conflict. 
  According to FRANCE PRESSE, Churkin is due to meet Bosnian 
Serb Leader Radovan Karadzic later in the day.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 13 Mar (TANJUG)--Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the Srpska republic's people's assembly, has said 
the Serbs have no reason to join with Croats and Muslims nor to 
allow anyone to deny them the right to join with the Serbs from 
other republics. 
  Krajisnik said this after talks in Pale today with the 
Russian president's special envoy Vitaliy Churkin, which took 
place after Churkin's talks with Muslim President Alija 
Izetbegovic in Sarajevo. 
  "Churkin came here to inform us about the talks he held with 
the Muslim side and about the talks between the Croats and 
Muslims. He wanted to hear our position on this," Krajisnik 
said after the talks with Churkin. 
  "Churkin said no obstacles should be put in the way of the 
Croat-Muslim agreement. He also said that some people think 
that the Serbs should also have a loose link with the 
Croat-Muslim federation, perhaps in the form of a union," 
Krajisnik said. 
  He added that he had told Churkin that the Serb side's 
position will be officially presented tomorrow in Belgrade, 
where Churkin is expected to meet Nikola Koljevic, the Srpska 
republic's deputy president, and Aleksa Buha, the foreign 
minister. 
  "Churkin told me the Bosnian Serbs should have a firmer link 
with the rest of the Serb people," Krajisnik said, and added 
that the Russian envoy did not define the nature of such a link 
in clear terms. "The concept is not exactly clear, but we have 
nevertheless undertaken the obligation to negotiate all possible 
solutions," Krajisnik said, adding that the Serb side is ready 
to resume talks as long as Serb interests are not threatened. 
  As regards Churkin's statement after the talks with 
Izetbegovic that Tuzla airport will not be under the control of 
Russian troops but that the Russian military observers will be 
deployed there, Krajisnik said: "We reached an agreement on 
this in Russia. According to the agreement, civilian Russian 
representatives will be deployed at Tuzla airport, together with 
the Serb ones. I think this is a realistic agreement, and Mr. 
Churkin said today the Russian side will insist on it. This 
gives us encouragement in our belief that we will finally reach 
the right solution for the opening of Tuzla airport," Krajisnik 
said in conclusion.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 12 (TANJUG)--Speaker of the Bosnian 
Serb Parliament Momcilo Krajisnik said on Saturday that a 
federation of Serbs with Moslems and Croats in Bosnia is 
"unnatural, illogical and unacceptable," but that the Bosnian 
Serb Republic would agree to talks as "a contribution to a 
future constructive approach to the resolving of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis." 
  "We do not accept a federation, but we accept talks on a 
new, 
future modality for linking Serbs, Croats and Moslems," 
Krajisnik said in a statement to the local radio in the Serbian 
town of Jagodina. 
  Krajisnik, however, warned that Bosnian Serbs would "attend 
such talks when the European Union, which we no longer trust, 
fulfills the promises it gave during negotiations so far." 
  Bosnian Serbs, Moslems and Croats have been waging a bitter 
war since April 1992 in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia- 
Herzegovina. Under strong pressure from the U.S., Bosnian 
Moslems and Croats signed an agreement in Washington last week 
on a federation of the territories which they control in Bosnia, 
which would later enter into a confederation with the also 
former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia. 
  In his statement to Radio Jagodina, Krajisnik said that 
Bosnian Serbs have an "absolutely negative stand" regarding 
Turkey's request to send its troops to Bosnia as part of the 
United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). 
  Krajisnik said that Turkey had once been an occupying force 
in the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, that it was "completely 
biased" and had "demanded the bombing of Serb positions in 
Bosnia." 
  "The presence of Turkish forces in Bosnia, even if only on 
the line of demarcation between Moslems and Croats, is not 
welcome and would mean a new fanning of the war," Krajisnik 
warned.

  [Text] Kragujevac, 13 March (TANJUG)--The chairman of the 
Srpska republic assembly, Momcilo Krajisnik, said today that 
"the future Muslim-Croat federation can encompass 45 percent of 
the territory at the most because that is the amount of 
territory owned by Muslims and Croats." 
  Taking part in Kragujevac Radio's "Pecat Vremena" program, 
Krajisnik said that all other statements were means of exerting 
pressure to make the Serbs give up more territory. 
  However, Krajisnik said that other things apart from the 
percentage of the territory were also important. Quality is also 
important and the Serb side will insist on this. 
  Asked about the Serb position for the tripartite talks which 
will take place next week, Krajisnik said that many matters were 
already settled except for the territorial demarcation. 
  "Two entities exist on the territory of former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina now--the Muslim-Croat federation and the 
Srpska republic. We have also agreed to discuss other, 
previously settled, issues so it cannot be said that we do not 
want to cooperate," Krajisnik said.

  [Text] Belgrade, 12 Mar (TANJUG)--The commander of the army 
of the Srpska republic, Gen. Ratko Mladic, this evening warned 
the head of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] mission for 
former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, that problematic actions by 
members of the French UN battalion deployed in the region of 
Bihac could lead to undesirable incidents. 
  In a letter to Akashi, Gen. Mladic stresses that the French 
UN battalion has deployed its reconaissance groups in front of 
the Muslim forces along the lines of separation facing the Serb 
units. 
  "Thus deployed UNPROFOR reconaissance groups have been used 
by the Muslim forces as a safe position from where they can open 
fire against positions held by the army of the Srpska republic. 
At the same time, they wish to trigger our retaliation against 
the UNPROFOR members, by which they would cause a conflict 
between the Serb forces and UNPROFOR," says Gen. Mladic's letter 
which was forwarded to TANJUG. 
  The commander of the army of the Srpska republic assesses 
that this deployment of the reconnaissance groups by the French 
battalion is "objectively speaking benefiting the protection of 
the Muslim forces and tolerating combat activities from thier 
positions and adjacent to them; this could force a reaction by 
our forces in terms of self-defense and cause more serious 
consequences." 
  Gen. Mladic recalls in his letter to Akashi that "hitherto 
not one member of the UNPROFOR forces has been killed by our 
forces, and other unpleasant situations are extremely rare," and 
he requests that the head of the UNPROFOR mission personally 
take it upon himself to see to it that the French reconnaissance 
groups are removed.

  [Excerpt] Negotiations with the Serb aggressor side 
continued at Sarajevo Airport today. The talks were conducted by 
Hasan Muratovic, Bosnia-Herzegovina minister without portfolio, 
who came from the airport a few minutes ago and made the 
following statement for Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. 
Muratovic, 
two days ago you had a meeting at which you agreed to resume the 
talks today. What was agreed today? 
  [Muratovic] Today we agreed something that we could not do 
last time. In brief, we agreed to sign an agreement by Tuesday. 
The details of it, according to our guidelines and minutes from 
the meeting, will be worked out by UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces]. The details include maps showing roads. 
  We have agreed to open up the Butmir-Dobrinja road--which 
will run across the airport runway--for our use, and the 
Lukavica-Ilidza road--which will also run across the airport 
runway--for use by the Serbian side. The roads will cut across 
each other at one point. We have also agreed to open up the 
Sarajevo-Visoko road via Vogosca, and to open the Grbavica 
bridge for civilians. 
  All this will be opened up simultaneously on Saturday, 18 
March, if the agreement is signed, which I no longer doubt will 
happen. Only UNPROFOR can now make some problems in this 
respect, as the roads run across the airport runway. [end 
recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] After three days of very intensive talks and work on 
the coordination of positions, the military representatives of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government and the Croatian Defense 
Council [HVO], Generals Rasim Delic and Ante Roso, signed a 
document on accepting certain principles for the implementation 
of military agreements as an obligation stemming from the 
general agreement in Washington. The document was signed at the 
Villa Dalmacija in Split in the presence of U.S. 
mediator-ambassador Jack Galvin. By signing the document, the 
military leaders of the Croat and Muslim sides in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina accepted and strongly upheld the earlier 
peace agreement concluded through UNPROFOR's [UN Protection 
Forces] mediation and accepted certain tasks concerning the 
organization of the federal army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The signing of this document by the military delegations of 
the HVO and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army was described by U.S. 
mediator Jack Galvin as historic. Galvin paid tribute to both 
sides for their support and readiness to implement the document 
in its entirety. The cease-fire process, as U.S. mediator Galvin 
said in a statement for the public, has taken off successfully 
in the field and is even being implemented beyond all 
expectations. This initial step and today's signing of the 
document by the military commanders of the HVO and the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army are also important because they prove to 
the United States that the agreement signed in Washington was 
something acceptable to both sides.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with General Rasim Delic, chief of </F>
general staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, in Split, by Mihat 
Kulender, in Sarajevo, on 12 March--live or recorded] 
  [Text] Our producer (?Mihat Kulender) talked to Army 
General Rasim Delic about the talks so far. 
  [Kulender] Mr. Delic, the talks concern the principles of 
military organization in the future federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. What were the concrete decisions reached so 
far? 
  [Delic] On 11 and 12 March, I had a meeting with General 
Roso 
in the Dalmacija villa here in Split, from where I am speaking, 
in the presence of General Galvin. One of the aims of the 
meeting was to create conditions for organizing a joint army of 
the future Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. During a constructive 
discussion over these past two days we found solutions to all 
problems linked, above all, to a transitional period. Namely, 
[word indistinct] was to first fully examine whether the Zagreb 
agreement of 23 February this year was implemented in its 
entirety. We came to a conclusion that a great deal has been 
done and that the work is nearly completed. The aim here was to 
create conditions for the overcoming of certain problems and the 
setting up of initially a shared and then a united command of 
the future federation, in accordance with the constitutional 
[word indistinct], which are expected to be passed and which 
will be signed by these three representatives, in our case by 
Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency. 
  In any case there were not too many controversial issues. 
Details of this agreement are being prepared. We are expecting 
to sign it any minute now, after which a joint press conference 
will be held. 
  [Kulender] What was the general atmosphere during the talks? 
The information media have been optimistic. 
  [Delic] One should say that the talks, even compared to the 
Zagreb talks on the cease-fire agreement, were even more 
constructive and the atmosphere was more relaxed. Every issue 
was examined from the aspect of the interests of both sides and 
above all in the interest of the future federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. I can say that, starting with the welcoming 
ceremony and all the honors bestowed on the representative and 
commander of the Bosnia- Herzegovina Army by the state 
authorities, i.e., the army of the Republic of Croatia, an 
atmosphere was created for conducting the talks in the most 
natural and best possible way and this is exactly what happened. 
  [Kulender] The talks were also attended by U.S. President 
Bill Clinton's special military envoy, General John Galvin. 
  [Delic] Yes, he was present. His presence was extremely 
important because he is a man with a rich military experience 
who made appropriate suggestions regarding the organization and 
functioning of such an important institution as the army. It is 
certain that this is a form of guarantee, a fact that gives 
backing to this agreement to be signed. 
  [Kulender] Mr. Delic, thank you for this conversation. In 
case we failed to ask you something you would wish to comment 
on, please go ahead. 
  [Delic] There is not much to add, but it should be said that 
this agreement covers many issues of vital importance to the 
army. All these issues certainly cannot be enumerated and 
commented in such a brief conversation. In any case, my best 
regards to your listeners, and I could say that we have 
established the dynamics for the further elaboration of this 
document because we shall not remain on the present text--we 
shall elaborate in the near future and come up with concrete 
solutions that should be implemented in the field as was the 
case with the implementation of the Zagreb agreement. 
  [Kulender] Thank you, Mr. Delic.

  [Excerpt] Extremists of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] 
have violated the cease-fire on the territory of the First Corps 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. 
  A Bosnia-Herzegovina Army soldier has been killed by a 
sniper 
bullet while another was wounded. One member of the civilian 
police and one woman have also been wounded, which confirms that 
the enemy, following its murderous instincts, does not 
differentiate between civilians and soldiers [no date given]. 
  HVO fired two artillery rounds and seven 60-mm shells on 
positions held by units commanded by Avdija Rozajac in the 
region of Smailovici and Vasino Brdo on 11 March. Intensive 
sniper and small arms fire was opened along the entire defense 
line manned by this unit, particularly in the area of Zavrtaljka 
and Smailovici. Shortly after 1900 hours yesterday evening, HVO 
extremists carried out combat actions from M-84 machine guns, 
the so-called death- sowers, and anti-aircraft guns from the 
region of Brestovica, while they were noticed to be entrenching 
themselves intensively above the village of (?Gagve), which is a 
clear indication of their future intentions. 
  While UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] military observers 
were 
trying to mediate in the exchange of the body of one 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army soldier which the HVO has held for a 
long time, small arms fire was opened on the international 
military observers from HVO positions. UNPROFOR members 
assessed this as a serious indicent. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Banja Luka, Mar 12 (TANJUG)--Moslem-Croat fighting 
in the central and southwest parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
continues despite an agreement, signed on Saturday, on forming a 
joint Croat-Moslem army. 
  The radio of the Bosnian Croat state of Herceg-Bosna said on 
Saturday that Moslem forces in the region of Kiseljak, Kresevo 
and [word indistinct] continue violating the ceasefire agreement 
by opening mortar and infantry fire on Croat positions. 
  The radio said that the situation in the other Moslem-Croat 
fronts was somewhat quieter but that the Moslem army continues 
reinforcing its positions, regrouping and bringing in fresh 
troops. 
  The Zagreb-based Croatian radio, however, said that on 
Saturday afternoon the Croat part of the Herzegovina city of 
Mostar was hit by a shell fired from the Moslem positions, after 
which a general alert was sounded. 
  Moslem Sarajevo radio claims that Croat snipers in Mostar 
continue firing on the separation line and civilian facilties in 
the Moslem-controlled part of the city. 
  According to the radio, in the southern parts of Mostar, the 
Croats are torching the remaining Moslem homes to prevent their 
owners from returning. 
  The Bosnian Moslems and Croats, who have been fiercly 
clashing in central and southwest Bosnia since last spring, are 
continuing their battles despite a draft agreement on a 
Moslem-Croat federation in this ex-Yugoslav republic which was 
signed early this month in Washington under strong U.S. pressure. 
  The military part of this agreement was on Saturday signed 
by 
the commanders of the Moslem and Croat forces, Rasim Delic and 
Ante Roso.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 13 (TANJUG)--Moslem-Croat clashes in 
central Bosnia-Herzegovina continue despite Saturday's military 
agreement on forming joint armed forces and Croat forces 
continue the destruction of Moslem religious objects. 
  Zagreb-based Croatian Radio reports on Sunday that Moslem 
units early that day attacked Bosnian Croat Army (HVO) positions 
in the area of Novi Travnik, central Bosnia. The Moslem Army, 
the source claims, fired explosive devices at Croat positions 
and opened fire from infantry weapons. 
  Meanwhile, Moslem-held Radio Sarajevo accuses "HVO 
extremists" of being against peace in central Bosnia. Croat 
troops attacked Moslem positions in the area of Zavidovici from 
infantry weapons and long-range rifles on Saturday, Radio 
Sarajevo says. 
  The radio says that Croat troops on Saturday also opened 
fire 
at the village of Vrhovine near Gornji Vakuf, where a Moslem 
soldier was wounded. Croat forces launched attacks on Moslem 
positions in the area of Kiseljak (to the west of Sarajevo) and 
near-by Fojnica, Radio Sarajevo says. 
  In Gromoljak, a village near Kiseljak, Croats blew up and 
razed the last mosque in this area two nights ago, so that there 
are now no Moslem religious objects there, Radio Sarajevo says 
in today's broadcasts. 
  On Sunday morning, regardless of their holiday of Bairam, 
the 
Moslems continued fierce attacks on the Brcko area, northern 
Bosnia. 
  The attack started at 0530 local time when Moslem units 
fired 
about 40 mortar shells on Serb defense lines from their 
positions to the south-west and west of Brcko. 
  Meanwhile, local Croat forces (HVO) in the Orasje area, 
north-west of Brcko, fired from small arms on Serb positions. 
  Bosnian Serb forces were forced to return fire, after which 
the attacks abated.

  [Text] Banja Luka, March 11 (TANJUG)--Bosnian Croat and 
Moslem authorities are rushing to ethnically cleanse the 
territories under their control before reaching final agreement 
on a Croat-Moslem federation in war-shattered 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bosnian Serb army sources said on Friday. 
  The Croat-populated village of Lovrici near Gradacac in the 
north has been completely depopulated, which the Moslem media 
are trying to deny. 
  Also, Croats in Zenica, central Bosnia, are selling out 
their 
property at a frenzied rate, a sure sign of preparations for a 
move-out. 
  Moslem authorities have ordered the torching of Croat houses 
in the abandoned village of Zubici near Travnik, also in central 
Bosnia, and the two sides are trading accusations of burning and 
demolishing houses around Mostar in the south. 
  On the Kiseljak front near Sarajevo on Friday, Moslem 
infantry forces attacked Croat positions at the locality of 
Kazagici in an effort to break into Croat-held territory, said 
Zagreb-based Croatian radio. 
  The Croat troops fought back and repulsed the attack at no 
casualties to themselves, the source said. 
  The Croatian radio correspondent in Mostar said on Friday 
that the exchange of prisoners, in the course of which Croats 
held in Bugojno, central Bosnia, and Moslem-controlled east 
Mostar should be released, "is not going well."

  [Text] [Correspondent Hajrudin Sermic in Maglaj] Maglaj is 
going through the worst day of shelling since the beginning of 
the war. 
  The unprecedented horrors of Maglaj's inferno have descended 
on the population with a vengeance this morning. The heaviest 
shelling since the beginning of the war is going on as I am 
filing this report. Dozens of howitzer and mortar shells fired 
in salvos are crashing onto the town center every minute. The 
town is being shelled from several directions and by all means 
at the enemy's [Bosnian Serbs] disposal. Five Russian-made 
surface-to-surface missiles have been fired at civilians and the 
town itself this morning. Casualties have been reported, 
although the exact numbers are impossible to determine. 
  The Serb aggressor's offensive against the defense positions 
held by our [Muslim] defenders continues with the support of 
several hundred missiles fired from artillery pieces of all 
calibers. Concentrated fire is being directed at the area around 
the Nekolje dam. However, the fighters of the 201st Valiant 
Brigade and other units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army cannot be 
swayed and are not giving in an inch.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 14 March within its 
regular 10-minute newscast carries several reports on the combat 
situation in the republic. 
  Hajrudin Fermic reports from Maglaj on "the Serbian 
aggressor's fierce attacks on the free territories" and says 
that "tank and mortar shells are occasionally (?pounding) all 
the front lines and chetnik snipers are looking for civilian 
victims in the northern part of the city." 
  A correspondent whose name is indistinct reports that "Olovo 
was again a target of the aggressor's attacks yesterday. During 
the day, long-range artillery was occasionally used to attack 
the defense lines. In the evening, [words indistinct] 
(?villages) came under heavy fire from the aggressor's 
howitzers, guns, and mortars." He says that "in Olovo this 
morning the enemy army is making infantry provocations." 
  Mirza Sadikovic reports from the Bihac region that "despite 
Yasushi Akashi's open invitation for NATO aircraft to be used to 
prevent the Serbian aggressor from running further amok in the 
Bihac region, they have nevertheless continued their [word 
indistinct] practice of ignoring the international public." He 
says that "artillery and tank activity against the center of 
Bihac intensified in the afternoon and evening. There are many 
casualties, and incomplete information indicates that at least 
eight citizens have been seriously wounded. There are many more 
people with slight wounds and some have been killed. The 
material damage is huge. These activities then spread to the 
outskirts, to the Cazin commune region, as well as to major 
roads. As for the defense lines, the artillery and tank 
activity and attempts at infantry breakthroughs are incessant. 
For the first time since the beginning of the offensive, the 
chetniks have shelled Orjanska Glavica and (Culumak), while in 
the zone covered by the Headquarters of the Croatian Defense 
Council, chetnik artillery targeted [word indistinct] the front 
lines and the regions around (Skocaj). There have also been 
activities from the so-called Serbian autonomous region of 
Krajina. In this period, major infantry battles have taken 
place, in which our defenders managed to thwart new attempts to 
break through. In addition, the chetniks have introduced a new 
tactic--their snipers are using silencers. At the front lines 
facing the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa 
autonomy, there are sporadic provocations and artillery activity 
all the time, particularly in the Cazin regions of (Trbac) (?or) 
[word indistinct]."

  [Excerpts] Banja Luka, 13 Mar (TANJUG)--Despite Bairam, 
members of the Muslim Army resumed their fierce attacks on 
Srpska republic army positions on the Brcko front [vital Serb 
corridor connecting Serbia and Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia, 
which passes through the town of Brcko] this morning, the 
information service of the 1st Corps of the Srpska republic army 
reported. 
  The attack was launched at 0530 this morning when Muslim 
units from Gornja Brka, nine kilometers southwest of Brcko, 
fired about 20 82-mm and 120-mm mortar shells. 
  Another 15 mortar shells have been fired on the Ulice 
district from the direction of the Bukovac train station, west 
of Brcko. Muslim forces also launched a fierce 82-mm mortar 
attack in the direction of Lipovac. 
  HVO [Croatian Defense Council] units have joined the 
attacks, 
opening fierce infantry fire from the direction of Kopanica in 
the wider area of Orasje [Bosnian Croat-held municipality north 
of the Serb corridor] on Serb positions in Krepsic. [passage 
omitted] 
  Regular units of the Republic of Croatia have not been 
withdrawn from former Bosnia-Herzegovina even though the UN 
Security Council deadline expired on 17 February.

  [Text] Doboj, March 14 (TANJUG)--Moslems launched five 
major infantry assaults with strong artillery support on the 
Doboj front in the north last night, but have been beaten back 
every time, Bosnian Serb military sources said on Monday. 
  Three of the attacks were on the Teslic front, south of 
Doboj, where the Moslems disregarded their festival of Bairam 
and engaged in strong offensive activities against the Serb 
positions. 
  Another abortive attack was launched on the south sector of 
the Trebava front, east of Doboj, which the Serbs beat back, 
suffering no casualties in the process. 
  Yet another futile effort to break through the Serb defence 
lines was undertaken on the western sector of the Ozren front, 
south of Doboj. Here, the Serbs also neutralised a Moslem 
terrorist group in an attempt to be infiltrated behind Bosnian 
Serb lines. 
  Serb villages on Mt. Ozren were subjected to strong 
small-arms fire by Moslem forces, which have been observed to be 
regrouping. 
  One Serb soldier was wounded by Croat small-arms fire from 
the direction of Orasje in the north after midnight, Serb 
military sources said. 
  Bosnian Serb positions were exposed to provocations also 
elsewhere in the Sava River basin during the night, but did not 
respond. 
  The Bosnian Serb army command in Herzegovina reported 
reduced 
Moslem operations and only sporadic fire from small-arms and 
anti-aircraft guns from the direction of Gorazde in the east. 
  In the coming days, Moslems are likely to launch assaults on 
Cajnice, Ustikolina and Kalinovik in the southeast and Borci in 
central Bosnia, the source said and attributed the present 
comparative lull in the fighting to the Bairam festival.

  [Text] Geneva, March 11 (AFP)--A row over the presence of 
Serb liaison officers to monitor aid deliveries is delaying the 
opening of Tuzla airport to relief flights, UN special envoy to 
ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi said Friday [11 March]. 
  It was "premature" to talk of an agreement in Moscow between 
Russia and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to re-open the 
airport, Akashi said. 
  The Serbs were insisting on liaison officers at the airport, 
a move vigorously opposed by the Moslem-led Bosnian government. 
  "The positions are quite apart," Akashi admitted. 
  Aid officials said the opening of the airport to 
humanitarian 
aid flights is vital to the 700,000 mainly Moslem inhabitants in 
the region who have been kept without adequate food since war 
broke out in Bosnia almost two years ago. 
  Nevertheless the UN is pressing ahead with work to ready the 
runway and airport to receive fixed winged aircraft within a 
week or two, Akashi said. 
  "We would like to do it with the agreement of the parties so 
that the airport will not be exposed to shelling or 
bombardment," he added. 
  When the airport does re-open, the humanitarian air bridge 
would fly in one or two flights per day, in daylight hours. 
  In a sign of some progress in the region, Ron Redmond, 
spokesman for the office of the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees, said aid distribution across Bosnia last week had been 
"extremely good," with 8,100 tonnes of aid delivered in the week 
to early Friday, some 83 percent of the target. 
  However, the UNHCR had protested to the Serbs over their 
blockade of convoys for the Moslem-held pockets of Maglaj and 
Tesanj, he added. 
  A fuel convoy was allowed into Gorazde where people have 
been 
dying in hospital because its electricity generator lacked fuel. 
  However the situation at Maglaj remained very serious with 
10 
aid trucks packed with supplies forced to return to Zagreb and 
Banja Luka, Redmond said. 
  "We will attempt to send two convoys at the start of next 
week from Zagreb and Zenica and will try also to reach Tesanj," 
the UNHCR spokesman said. 
  Although Redmond said the UNHCR had protested strongly to 
the 
Serbs over the delays, Akashi blamed "Croat populations from 
neighbouring villages" for blocking the convoys. 
  The Japanese diplomat said that at a meeting with the three 
warring parties in the Bosnian conflict in Geneva on Thursday he 
had sensed "isolation, some bitterness and hardening" of the 
Serb position over a U.S.-sponsored plan for a Moslem-Croat 
federation in Bosnia. 
  On the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, Akashi said "total freedom 
of movement should be possible within the next several weeks," 
but said further negotiations were needed with the Bosnian 
government and the Serb side. 
  UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is expected to 
address the UN Security Council in the next few days to say 
which countries would be invited to send contingents to the UN 
Protection Force in Bosnia, Akashi said. 
  The UN chief said 10,000 extra troops would be needed to 
maintain the "still fragile" ceasefire in Bosnia. 
  Meanwhile, the UN Protection Force successfully rotated 
Canadian troops in the eastern Moslem enclave of Srebrenica with 
their Dutch counterparts.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bisera Turkovic, the Republic of </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina's ambassador to Croatia, by Milan Jelovac; 
place and date not given: "The Serbs Will Also Accept the 
Federation"] 
  [Text] Mrs. Bisera Turkovic is the ambassador of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to Croatia, a country which, according to the 
Washington agreement, could soon form a confederation with the 
Republic of Croatia. On this occasion, we asked her to comment 
on the documents signed in Washington. 
  [Turkovic] They were preliminary agreements on forming a 
federal Bosnia-Herzegovina and a confederal union of the two 
sovereign states, the Republic of Croatia and the federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The agreement involves calming down the war 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina and not only that: It might eliminate the 
danger of the definitive collapse of the state of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and of creating a precedent that would then 
definitely also be applied to the Republic of Croatia. 
  [Jelovac] You, therefore, think that signatures of the 
Croatian and Muslim representatives in Washington saved the 
state of Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Turkovic] They saved Bosnia-Herzegovina for sure, but 
partly also Croatia, considering what could happen after a 
possible division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Jelovac] What kind of state will it be? What about the 
Serbs, who are a constituent nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Turkovic] Bosnia-Herzegovina should be organized as a 
federation, composed of cantons that would be constituted 
according to the majority nation, whether Croatian or Bosniak. 
Naturally, the concept of federation, i.e., of cantonization, 
is open and offered to the Serbs as well. 
  [Jelovac] With regard to the great interest in central 
Bosnia, can you tell us which central Bosnian towns will be 
included in the Croatian canton? 
  [Turkovic] Details of that agreement, primarily the borders, 
the exact areas of demarcation, will be determined on the basis 
of an appendix to the agreement. Working groups are supposed to 
determine that in Vienna in 11 days. We will then know the 
answer to many questions, all the details on the demarcation of 
the cantons and their number. After that, on 15 March, 
President Tudjman and President Izetbegovic are to sign the 
final agreement on the federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and 
the agreement on the confederation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
Croatia. 
  [Jelovac] The possible confederation foresees a common 
currency and borders, and the free flow of people and capital. 
Will there be a border between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
and will there be customs? 
  [Turkovic] As this will be a customs union, there will be no 
mutual customs duties. The agreement on confederation would 
have another two additional agreements that are not proposed in 
their preliminary form. One of them is the agreement on the 
free flow of goods through the federation, that is, without 
customs and inspections on the territory of the federation. 
That solves a very topical problem for Croatia, which is, in a 
way, divided by Neum. All citizens of the federation will be 
granted free access to the Republic of Croatia and free use of 
roads, railroads, and airline routes. Therefore, the agreement 
allows better communications, which would be very stimulating 
for economic relations and it would revitalize the economy and 
tourism, not to mention the stability of the region. 
  [Jelovac] Still, one cannot deny that Bosnia-Herzegovina was 
not very developed in former Yugoslavia and that it constantly 
had to be financially supported. Who will finance it now? 
  [Turkovic] Many indicators which were manipulated before 
cannot indicate the real situation. Bosnia-Herzegovina can 
surely finance itself, it can even finance a much wider 
territory. In view of its potential, its mineral resources, and 
its great concentration of industry, it has no problems in 
financing itself. Furthermore, Bosnia-Herzegovina also has the 
chance to get substantial finances from Western European 
countries, the United States, emigrees, and the Arab countries. 
This eastern source was very much exploited in the former 
system, but it was not widely publicized. 
  [Jelovac] Do you see the future federation as a democratic 
state since Clinton has announced that he will support the 
existence of Bosnia-Herzegovina even with military force. 
  [Turkovic] That is a matter of scale and the legality of 
application of the penal system. If it is used to preserve 
democracy, then it is very much needed. President Clinton spoke 
to that effect. In order to preserve peace and protect human 
rights, which was emphasized in the preliminary agreement, even 
repressive measures might be taken in Bosnia-Herzegovina, if 
necessary. All that to preserve what people at this moment very 
much need--freedom, full democracy, and human rights. 
  [Jelovac] If the U.S. initiative forces Croatia to 
compromise, that is, to accept confederation with 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, does that mean that Alija Izetbegovic 
relinquishes the concept of a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Turkovic] All solutions, especially those in military 
conflicts, are compromises. Therefore, this solution is 
somewhere between the interests of the two sides. It is 
necessary to compromise in order to have peace, normalize 
relations, and save human lives, which should be our first goal. 
The U.S. formula is ideal: It enables the preservation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, very substantial rights, and the national 
identities in this case of two nations, and it also gives a 
chance to the third one within the framework of the proposed 
federation. 
  [Jelovac] How do you interpret the return of Russia to the 
Balkans, and especially to Bosnia-Herzegovina, in view of the 
open support that it is giving to the Bosnian Serbs? 
  [Turkovic] It is no secret, it is quite clear and quite 
logical. However, the support can be interpreted in different 
ways. Someone's patronage can be directed in a positive sense, 
toward bringing people to their senses. It can also be in a 
negative context, in the sense of creating irrational illusions 
about domination and power. At this moment, we see the role of 
Russia as positive. Russia is obviously having a realistic and 
rational influence on the Serbs, who probably had illusions 
about much greater protection, which would unquestioningly 
protect everything Serbian regardless of reality and the 
irrationality of the demands. The latest meeting between 
Karadzic and Kosyrev, which resulted in the Serbs agreeing to 
reopen Tuzla airport, proves that. So does Karadzic's 
acceptance of the federation between the Bosniaks and the Croats 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and also his openness to finding ways for 
the Serbs to accept the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation as well. 
That will not be easy but we must begin somewhere. 
  [Jelovac] The first reactions of the Bosnian Serbs to the 
Washington agreement called it "an internal matter between the 
Croats and the Muslims." Judging from the statements of Western 
officials who do not directly mention the Serbs, the third 
constituent nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, one gets the 
impression that the Serbs are even being given the possibility 
to leave Bosnia- Herzegovina and join the FRY [Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia]. Anyway, Karadzic's main political goal is the 
unification "of all Serbian lands." What will happen to the 
Serbs, will they stay in Bosnia-Herzegovina or will they leave? 
  [Turkovic] At this moment, there are different 
interpretations of the situation. There are external elements 
that must not be neglected, for they can be crucial. It would 
be naive to believe that the destiny of the Balkans and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina exclusively depends upon their inhabitants. 
There are, of course, much wider strategic interests that have 
always determined the outcome of conflicts in these parts. 
  [Jelovac] You think that, therefore, the state of Bosnia- 
Herzegovina will not be able to prevent the possible decision by 
the Bosnian Serbs to join their native Serbia, if they are not 
stopped by the appropriate international factors? 
  [Turkovic] If these international factors were in favor of 
the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina, then such agreements would 
not be signed. But, even if the international community were 
intent on dividing Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is questionable 
whether this could be done. In this case, the situation is just 
the opposite: We have the very firm stance of the international 
community and the United States to preserve Bosnia-Herzegovina 
as an integral country, territorially speaking. That is a 
factor that the Serbs, too, will have to face and accept the 
solution. Naturally, not a solution necessarily at their 
expense, but a solution that is a compromise and departure from 
their absolute demands. The Serbs will have to come to terms 
with that. 
  [Jelovac] If the Serbs stay in Bosnia-Herzegovina, what 
will their relationship be with the Croat-Bosniak federation and 
the confederation of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina? What will 
their relations be with their native Serbia? Would it not be a 
restoration of Yugoslavia, with only the Macedonians and the 
Slovenes missing? 
  [Turkovic] I would not like to attempt to solve this issue 
now; we must first see the final shape of the agreement on 
creating the federation and confederation. There will surely be 
a role for the Serbs as well, respecting their identity, of 
course. They will then be proposed a role. 
  [Jelovac] You recently appeared on Croatian Television and, 
speaking about the ethnic Serbs, you stated: "We will see to 
what extent the Serbs will remain in Bosnia-Herzegovina." What 
does that mean, does it mean the Serbs will leave, and where 
will they go and what will they take along? Bundles or the 
territory they hold? 
  [Turkovic] You know, all those who cannot fit into a certain 
framework usually leave certain areas and go somewhere else. 
With regard to the Serbs, we must say that, unfortunately, a 
large number of them have blood on their hands as they have 
committed terrible crimes. Those people, even if there were 
forgiven, and we should not forgive anyone, will surely not stay 
where they lived before. They will go somewhere. But many who 
were misled will stay, for we cannot and must not blame the 
entire nation for crimes committed by a gang of terrorists that 
received support from a sizable part of their nation. That is 
the reality. 
  [Jelovac] Which part of the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory 
would you give to the Serbs to be annexed to Serbia? 
  [Turkovic] Not a single part. 
  [Jelovac] How do you imagine that 70 percent of the 
territory will be given back? Through diplomacy and 
negotiations or through the war option, together with the Croats 
when they and the Serbs normalize relations? 
  [Turkovic] Greater Serbia is not created only in Belgrade. 
It does not depend on the Serbs alone. The creation of greater 
Serbia also largely depends on both the Croats and the Bosniaks. 
If Croatia agrees to negotiate to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina 
with the Serbs, then it is creating greater Serbia at the same 
time. Not only at the expense of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also 
at its own. With the unity of the two nations in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and with the support of neighboring Croatia, 
the cause of the problem is slowly coming to the surface. When 
you have a clearly identified enemy and perpetrator of the 
aggression, then it is easy to apply punishment and get support 
for the punishment. 
  [Jelovac] By military means? 
  [Turkovic] We will see about that. It is not only up to us 
to use those means.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo mosques were full of believers this 
morning; the Beg's Mosque in particular where the Muslims were 
addressed by the head of the Islamic community in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Reis Ulema Mustafa Ceric. [passage omitted] 
  The believers were also addressed by the President of the 
Presidency of ours state, Alija Izetbegovic. Here is an excerpt 
from his address: 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] On this occasion we should 
remember those who are facing considerable difficulties even 
today: those in Maglaj, Bihac, or near Olovo. Thank God, it is 
somewhat easier in some other places, Allah Akbar. This is a 
chance to remember them and to ask the God to help them, to give 
patience to the weak and power to the strong to endure. This is 
perhaps a chance to remember with pride that we belong to a 
huge, huge mass of people, celebrating Bairam today--a billion 
people-- and, like us, hundreds of millions are attending Bairam 
prayers, marking this great day. 
  You must know that the struggle is not over yet. More 
difficult days are ahead. However, do not be afraid, we belong 
to a nation which believes that you die once and live twice.

  [Text] Banja Luka, Belgrade, March 14 (TANJUG)--The 
political and military Bosnian Muslim leadership is preparing to 
make changes in the leadership of the Muslim region of Tuzla, in 
north Bosnia, dissatisfied by the moderate position and growing 
resistance of the local authorities to the continuation of war, 
it has been learnt from informed Serbian military sources. 
  The Muslim leadership does not like the policy pursued by 
the 
leadership of the Tuzla municipality, since it affects also the 
different trends and political divisions in the Muslim 
leadership in Sarajevo, and blunts the fighting fervor against 
Serbs. 
  In accordance with the radical policy of Muslim leader Alia 
Izetbegovic, new orders for mobilization have been issued in the 
Tuzla region in order to continue the offensive on Serbian 
positions towards Brcko and east of Tuzla towards Doboj, Trebava 
and Podrinja, a region under Serbian control in Bosnia. 
  Izetbegovic ordered last week his forces to capture Doboj 
and 
its surroundings, whatever the cost. 
  In the last few days, Muslim units have been reinforced to 
launch an offensive on Serbian sttlements and positions on the 
Mountain Majevica, east of Tuzla. 
  The brigade was reinforced by the so-called Sarajevo Muslim 
Army Corps, whose forces have been transferred from central 
Bosnia following the signing of the accord with Croats and the 
placing of heavy weaponry around Sarajevo under U.N. control.

Diaconescu, chief of the Counterespionage Division of the 
Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI], was removed from office. 
Virgil Magureanu, director of SRI, has ordered a full

  Sources from the SRI leadership have told us that the cause 
that led to the demotion of the counterespionage division head 
is "a complicated one." 
  Despite the fact that one of the rumors that are circulating 
claimed that Major General Diaconescu had been placed under 
arrest, our own investigations have proved that this was a false

  [Text] At a meeting of the Democratic Party [PD] Steering 
Collegium, Chairman Petre Roman outlined the party's position 
regarding the current political issues. 
  In his speech, Roman said that the only way to solve the 
current crisis situation is to conclude a national pact among 
the PD, the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR], and the 
Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. 
  The PD chairman also briefed the meeting's attendants about 
the PD's [separate] negotiations that are currently under way 
with the CDR and the PDSR and presented the party's stance 
regarding the [6 March] government reshuffle and the possibility 
of early elections. Referring to the latter issue, Roman said 
that in the PD's view, early elections would lead to a disaster, 
since the electorate, which was betrayed during the last 
electoral campaign, has lost confidence in everyone and 
everything.

  [Excerpt] At its weekly meeting yesterday, the government 
adopted a decision on the altering of the nationwide minimum 
monthly gross salary, the payment of which is guaranteed by the 
government, setting it at 60,000 lei for 178 worked hours [per 
month]. 
  Among the draft bills that were examined and adopted 
yesterday, we would like to mention the one referring to 
Romania's adherence to the General Accord on the Immunities and 
Privileges of the Council of Europe and the one proposing that 
parliament ratify the European Convention on the Prevention of 
Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Punishment or Handling of 
Persons. The aforementioned documents are intended to make 
Romania adjust to the institutional standards of the Council of 
Europe, a communique released by the government says. [passage

  [Excerpts] An agreement has been reached in Vienna, that 
is, a draft constitution for the federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has been signed. Our correspondent Mirjana 
Rakic is on the phone from Vienna. Good evening, colleague 
Rakic. We waited for 10 days. What has actually happened now? 
  [Rakic] Statements, that is, an agreement has been reached. 
Nothing has been signed in Vienna. The signatures will be put 
down only in Washington, as Charles Redman said, at the end of 
this week, that is, around Friday the 18th--the date that was 
mentioned yesterday. 
  The agreement on the draft constitution of the federation 
has 
been reached. This is an agreement in principle on the issues 
which were not disputed in the beginning--a confederal union. 
What remains to be solved now are details of measures in the 
interim period, that is, from now until the establishment of the 
future federation, which implies the parallel functioning of the 
existing authorities and interim bodies until the constitutional 
assembly and new elections are held. [passage omitted] 
  We have not been able to obtain the draft constitution which 
has 52 pages. Charles Redman said that the draft will be ready 
tomorrow because it simply needs to be printed. His statement 
leads one to believe that a great compromise has been reached 
because, according to him, both the president and the government 
have great authority. We can see what is whose specific 
competence only when we obtain the document. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vienna, March 13 (AFP)--Bosnian Croats and Moslems 
reached an agreement here Sunday [13 March] on creating a canton 
for each group in central Bosnia, authoritative Croat sources 
announced. 
  The accord came after talks on forming a Croat-Moslem 
federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina resumed at the U.S. Embassy, 
amid signs that negotiators would probably reach an overall 
agreement later in the day. 
  Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic earlier said: "We 
shall 
try to finish up this morning," while Bosnian Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic said he was "still optimistic." 
  Croat sources said late Saturday [12 March] only "a few 
technical problems" remained and a global accord would probably 
be announced Sunday. 
  The behind-closed-doors talks began here on March 4 after 
Granic and Silajdzic signed an initial agreement on March 1 in 
Washington.

  [Text] Our interview guest is Colonel Legrier, commander of 
French forces in Bihac. Edouard Balladur has now arrived in 
Bosnia after travelling from Zagreb. He is due to visit Bihac, 
a Muslim enclave besieged by the Serbs, where a French UN 
soldier was killed on Friday [11 March]. Systematically 
targetted in the last few days, the UN soldiers on the ground 
want stronger powers to hit back. Colonel Legrier: 
  [Begin recording] [Legrier] The visit by our prime minister 
and our defense minister is very much appreciated, because we 
have been in an extremely tense situation over the last two 
weeks. Our men have been repeatedly targetted and have come 
very close to death. They have behaved quite magnificently, and 
the presence among us today of these two high-ranking officials 
is very good for their morale. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you expect something in 
particular from this visit? We know that the French forces 
deployed in Bihac have called for NATO air strikes. 
  [Legrier] That is quite true. On Thursday [10 March], I 
asked for a NATO air strike, which could not be carried out. I 
asked for one again last night [12 March]. I received 
authorization for a strike, but unfortunately it came too late: 
The target that had been attacking us had time to disappear 
into the undergrowth, so we were unable to strike. What we need 
is a great deal of determination on the part of the authorities 
in order to raise the many constraints that are weighing down 
the decisionmaking process, and which make our decisions very 
difficult to carry out. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you think that the political 
authorities need to go further still? 
  [Legrier] I honestly think we have gone some way to solving 
the problem in Sarajevo by showing a great deal of 
determination. We need to show the same determination 
everywhere. [end recording]

  [Text] A NATO delegation, led by Assistant Secretary 
General for Political Affairs Count Gebhard von Moltke, is 
paying a one-day visit to Slovenia today. Prime Minister Dr. 
Janez Drnovsek was the first to greet the guests in Bled. They 
met with Defense Minister Janez Jansa and Foreign Ministry Under 
Secretary Ignac Golob in Ljubljana. Tomaz Gerden has more 
details: 
  [Begin recording] [Gerden] Following the talks in Villa 
Podroznik, Count Von Moltke was the first to give a brief 
statement: 
  [Von Moltke, in English fading into translation by Gerden] I 
am very pleased that NATO has the opportunity to cooperate with 
Slovenia within Partnership for Peace. This plan initially 
pooled former Warsaw Pact countries, which are members of the 
NATO Cooperation Council. Partnership for Peace aims to 
strengthen stability in Europe and cooperation between NATO and 
other countries in peace initiatives within the United Nations 
and the CSCE. 
  The NATO delegation discussed details of Partnership for 
Peace with our representatives. The initiative will be 
officially signed by Prime Minister Dr. Drnovsek in Brussels on 
30 March. He said the following about today's talks: 
  [Drnovsek] Today's visit is dedicated to the preparations 
for this signing, as well as the concrete activities that will 
ensue--joint planning with NATO, preparation of cadres, and 
exchange of opinions on the security situation. I believe that 
everything is progressing well, that Slovenia is being treated 
very seriously as a NATO partner, and that there is a belief on 
both sides that we will develop a partnership very quickly. 
  [Gerden] Dr. Drnovsek believes that neutral countries like 
Switzerland and Sweden will also join Partnership for Peace soon 
and that our country is in no way in any worse position than the 
members that have already been admitted. 
  Defense Minister Janez Jansa assessed the Partnership for 
Peace plan as follows: 
  [Jansa] From a security viewpoint, membership in Partnership 
for Peace for Slovenia is almost as equally important as 
international recognition. This represents a starting point for 
us, the beginning of a road, at the end of which is the greatest 
possible security that a country can obtain in a family of 
like-minded states. 
  This is particularly important because geographically, 
Slovenia on one side borders a relatively solid region of 
stability and on the other side, a region of instability. 
Membership in Partnership for Peace will allow us to strengthen 
relations with the part of Europe that represents a factor of 
stability, which is, of course, a precondition for any sort of 
social and economic development. 
  [Gerden] The NATO delegation was also received by President 
Milan Kucan. The delegation also met with the ambassadors of 
NATO member states. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, president of </F>
the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia, by Sandi Frelih in Bled on 12 
March--recorded] 
  [Text] [Frelih] President Janez Drnovsek, first our 
congratulations on the formation of your new party. 
  [Drnovsek] Thank you! 
  [Frelih] How do you see the political center? 
  [Drnovsek] The Liberal Democracy of Slovenia [LDS] will 
definitely be a party of the political center. I personally see 
the political center in this party being a moderate party of 
moderate political views, devoid of any special ideology. We do 
not wish to change the world like various ideological parties 
have aspired to in the past, but to merely survive in this world 
in the best possible way. For this reason, this will be a party 
that will primarily emphasize the need for stability in 
Slovenia, the need for political and economic stability, a party 
that will build on maturity in the leadership of the country and 
experiences gained in it, and a party that will build on a firm 
financial and economic system, which would give as much as 
possible leeway to the free initiative of our people so that we 
can assert ourselves in the spheres where I believe the Slovenes 
are the strongest--namely, hard work and lots of initiative. 
  We will offer what we have been offering in the LDS for the 
last two years, what is already producing results, and what is 
leading Slovenia out of the crisis. 
  [Frelih] A new large formation has been created. You will 
command one-third of all seats in parliament. What do you fear 
more--internal frictions in the new party because of, shall we 
say, strong personalities or coalition disputes in the 
government itself? 
  [Drnovsek] The LDS has been a big party even so far. The new 
LDS will also be a big, even bigger party. In any big party 
there are different people and different interests that need to 
be mutually coordinated. One must seek a balance between them. 
As the leader of this party I have been doing this even so far, 
relatively successfully, I trust. I am doing the same as the 
head of the government coalition and the prime minister. In a 
way, I am constantly juggling various interests; therefore, I do 
not expect any major problems of that nature in the future. I 
expect that we will manage to maintain and pursue a balanced 
policy within the party and within the government. 
  Regarding powerful political personalities, there have been 
many in the LDS so far. There are many in the present 
government coalition and there were some in the previous 
coalition, too, however, in both cases things functioned fairly 
well, I guess.

  [Excerpt] Four parties held separate congresses in Bled 
this morning prior to the unification congress that is scheduled 
to commence in half an hour. 
  The Liberal Democratic Party [LDS], the Democratic Party, 
the 
Greens-Ecologically Social Party, and the Socialist Party are 
thus supposed to form the new LDS--the Liberal Democracy of 
Slovenia. 
  The new party, which, after unification, will possess 30 
seats in parliament, which is one-third of all deputies, will 
continue to be led by Dr. Janez Drnovsek. He particularly 
emphasized the importance of continued cooperation with the 
Christian Democrats this morning. We have reports by Bojan 
Veselinovic, Sandi Frelih, and Gojko Brvar from the separate 
party congresses in Bled this morning: 
  [Begin recording] [Veselinovic] The morning congress of the 
Liberal Democrats was opened by party president Dr. Janez 
Drnovsek, who said that foreign countries are following the 
events in our country with interest and added that the 
reputation of the present LDS is growing gradually but steadily. 
Faced with the choice of whether to continue building on teh 
party's autonomy and risk another showdown with the newly 
emerged party or to link itself with the Eco-Greens, the 
Socialists, and the Democrats, we have decided in favor of 
unification, Drnovsek said. 
  Unification, he said, does not mean a change in the 
composition of the present coalition. Drnovsek particularly 
stressed the need for the new LDS to cooperate with the 
Christian Democrats to ensure the stability of the political 
scene. Relations will be good with the two remaining government 
parties until program differences occur, Drnovsek said. 
  The afternoon unification congress is supposed to elect: 
Drnovsek as the president of the new LDS, [Dimitrij] Rupel as 
the president [as heard]; 60 members of the party council, which 
will be formed proportionally on the basis of the results of the 
last general elections; [Igor] Bavcar, [Vika] Potocnik, [Viktor] 
Zakelj, and [Peter] Tancig for vice presidents; and [Gregor] 
Golobic as secretary general. 
  They will subsequently agree as to who will coordinate the 
work of the clubs of deputies of the three merging parties in 
the parliament. The afternoon congress is also supposed to 
decide about the amendment to the proposed documents, with 
which, bearing in mind various material situations in the 
merging parties, secretaries general of these parties would 
guarantee with their personal assets the settlement of any 
possible party debts. 
  Let us also report that the new LDS will have 30 seats in 
parliament, which is two seats less than it would have had if 
the current Democratic deputies [Tone] Persak and [Danica] 
Simsic were have supported unification. [passage omitted] [end 
recording]

  [Excerpts] Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky has 
also participated in the 15 March [anniversary of the outbreak 
of the 1848 Hungarian War of Independence] celebration in 
Vojvodina. Here is Szilveszter Varga's report. 
  [Varga] [passage omitted] Referring to the current 
situation, 
the Hungarian foreign minister said at the celebration: 
  [Begin Jeszenszky recording] [passage omitted] Lajos Kossuth 
[leader of the 1848 Hungarian War of Independence] advocated 
lasting peace when, in emigration, he promulgated the idea of a 
Danube confederation and this lasting peace is advocated today 
by all European and world bodies. The principles are there, and 
the documents are ready too--only the signatures are needed. 
  On behalf of the Hungarian Government I can say with full 
responsibility that the Hungarian Government, the Hungarian 
nation has drafted this document, this peace document and we are 
ready to sign it--only the countersignature needs to be put on 
it next to ours. We are waiting for that countersignature by 
those in power today--here [in Serbia] too. We are waiting for 
them to sign [as an undertaking that they would grant] those 
rights, which their own heroes demanded in Sremski Karlovci and 
elsewhere in 1848. 
  If they sign these rights then there will be peace in the 
entire Danube region and the others will be able to shake with 
good intent the outstretched hand of the Hungarian Government 
and the Hungarian nation. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Istvan Balsai, a member of </F>
the Hungarian Democratic Forum National Executive Committee, by 
Karoly Lencses; place and date not given: "The Minister, Too, 
Is Primarily a Party Politician"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Lencses] Your role is 
often seen to be controversial. While you have achieved 
spectacular successes in the area of the administration of 
justice, you have been attacked for your views on the provision 
of justice for past crimes and your role in the disciplinary 
action against the media chairmen. 
  [Balsai] I have indeed been attacked many times, but this is 
mainly due to the political situation. In Austria, for example, 
this position is often filled by people not committed to 
parties; therefore, the Justice Ministry is a kind of guarantee 
against party politicians. However, the situation is different 
in Hungary because it would have been alien to the unfolding 
democracy to place an expert rather than a party politician in a 
governmental position. Therefore, the justice minister has to 
implement the coalition's requirements, and from this it follows 
that his activities cannot always be supported by a full 
consensus. At the same time, this ministry was given a 
prominent role in establishing the legal background for the 
change of the regime, and the various political forces did not 
agree on this as well. People who have different views on all 
these issues tend to attack the justice minister, stating that 
he is not allowed to take part in politics because he would then 
exert pressure on the administration of justice. 
  [Lencses] It is indeed difficult to interpret some of your 
statements in any other way. 
  [Balsai] In theory, I might even agree with this view. 
However, when the coalition promised compensation in the form of 
the punishment of the responsible people belonging to the past 
regime, when--mainly in the interest of the legitimacy of the 
judges--it made its goal the replacement of the former leaders 
of the judiciary, or when our ministry was given the task of 
conducting disciplinary action against the leader of the public 
service medium that, according to the government, is under the 
supervision of the executive power, the justice minister could 
hardly be a politically neutral player in current affairs. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Lencses] Let us return to your more immediate area: What 
achievements are you most proud of, and have you had any real 
painful failures? 
  [Balsai] The complex legal regulation of compensation can 
give us cause for some satisfaction because we implemented the 
goals laid down in the Program of National Renewal. Similarly, 
I view it as a success that the courts have become truly 
independent and legitimate in every sense. I quietly note that 
the level of the performances might be lower than expected on 
the basis of the judges' income and conditions. However, this 
is not politics because it is a fact that the procedures are 
often protracted. On the other hand, the probable rejection of 
the draft bill on the public prosecution is one of my failures. 
It is possible that the timing was wrong and the gap between 
the opposition's leading jurist-politicians and our views has 
become too wide, although, some time ago, we held the same views 
on settling the constitutional position of the public 
prosecutor's office. 
  [Lencses] Some people oppose subordinating public 
prosecution to the government precisely because you are the 
minister. 
  [Balsai] This is an unjustified and impractical approach: 
We are leaving serious gaps in legislation because of 
short-term thinking and that focusing on particular people. As 
a matter of fact, it is also not true that the subordination of 
the prosecution to the government cannot be implemented because 
of the current court structure. However, we should now start to 
think about whether the next government will have better chances 
of getting the bills passed, which requires a two-thirds 
majority in Parliament. 
  [Lencses] What are your views on the failure of the media 
bill? Because of the missing law, the provision of unbiased 
information will soon be out of the question, and we should also 
not forget about the peculiar personnel decisions and the many 
dismissals. 
  [Balsai] I am not convinced that the Justice Ministry had 
the best conditions for preparing the bill. Therefore, I do not 
really see this as a personal failure. We did all we could and, 
if the talks are broken off, the reason will be that the 
opposition is insisting on the sacking of the two deputy 
chairmen. It is clear that this points beyond the media law 
because the preparation of a law cannot be linked to personnel 
decisions. As for unbiased reporting, I try to watch the news 
on television and the program "The Week" [A Het] and, in my 
view, they fulfill this requirement. [passage omitted] 
  [Lencses] The parties making up the current coalition will 
probably not get an absolute majority [in the elections]. In 
this case, what will happen? 
  [Balsai] It is almost certain that none of the parties can 
expect a similar result to that in 1990, namely, more than 40 
percent of the mandates. What kind of government can be formed 
will obviously be decided at the coalition talks. However, it 
is certain that the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] will not 
enter into a coalition with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] 
or the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. Apart from this, we 
do not exclude any possibilities. At a time like this, it is 
wise to speak with caution and not to exclude certain factors 
from the start. However, the MDF would not be able to work 
together with the MSZP or the SZDSZ without a significant change 
in its political direction. 
  [Lencses] Does this mean that you trust that you will be 
able to divide the liberal bloc and separate the Federation of 
Young Democrats [FIDESZ] from it? 
  [Balsai] Indeed, it is only the FIDESZ that can be taken 
into consideration from there because it is possible that the 
Agrarian Federation or the Entrepreneurs' Party will not be 
parliamentary factors. I see much difference between the SZDSZ 
and the FIDESZ because the latter describes itself as a center 
party that represents national values. The term liberal has 
little meaning on its own because all parties would accept the 
values of liberalism! As a matter of fact, the FIDESZ is 
characterized much more by pragmatism than liberalism. 
  [Lencses] However, what do the voters think about the 
FIDESZ's rapid approach to the MDF? 
  [Balsai] In my view, the FIDESZ has not really changed; 
rather, it is the SZDSZ that has moved considerably to the left. 
Let us remember that, in addition to expressing a willingness to 
reach agreement, the statements of the leaders of the MSZP and 
SZDSZ actually reflect the intention to cooperate. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Lencses] It is not impossible that, once the votes have 
been counted, the result will not be in your favor. 
  [Balsai] [passage omitted] If the current coalition does 
not emerge victorious from the elections, rather than being a 
natural phase in the system of political rotation, this would be 
a failure because it would mainly indicate that a large number 
of citizens are disappointed with the process of the change of 
the regime. In this case, to whom would they give their vote of 
confidence? The legal successor of the former state party! 
  [Lencses] Is this your failure or would it also be Hungary's 
fall? 
  [Balsai] This would mean applying brakes to the development 
process; let us just think about the Polish example where the 
willingness of foreigners to invest has decreased, a general 
strike is imminent, and they have already moved further away 
from European integration. 
  [Lencses] Are you afraid of the restoration of the former 
system? 
  [Balsai] Here, we no longer need to be worried about a 
dictatorship, but we have to worry about the halting of a 
process that has already started and that is promising; in other 
words, we would find ourselves lagging further behind. 
Naturally, we cannot know yet whether the voters are patient 
enough and whether they can assess the events of the past four 
years with the necessary maturity. If they do, then they will 
give us another four years; if not, they will give preference to 
the rather uncertain new factors that might be appearing with 
fine-sounding promises. In this case, the economy will 
obviously be put on a different course of development, 
privatization will take a different direction, and welfare 
policy will be placed on different bases. However, I wonder who 
would benefit from a fundamental change in this phase of our 
development? [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by S. Padori: "The Alternatives `Covered' the </F>
South"] 
  [Text] Three weeks after the Greek blockade of the border, 
our state not only leads a normal life, at least regarding the 
oil supply, but the established cooperation with, and the 
understanding of, our eastern and western neighbors [Bulgaria 
and Albania] inspired the eastern-western corridor. What is 
even more important, compared to the August embargo in 1992, 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] met 
this blockade with solid reserves of oil derivatives, therefore 
there is time enough to make new agreements and activate new 
alternative traffic directions without feeling the lack of oil 
derivatives on the market. 
  The government appeal that panic was superfluous and that 
the 
"occupation" of the gas stations was unnecessary was fruitful, 
at least during the past three weeks, because we saw that it was 
possible to buy fuel with or without the concessions of the 
Greek side! 
<H5>  Reserves for Tranquility </H5>
  According to yesterday's reserves of oil in the country, 
consumers can remain calm. As Assistant Minister Tome Cemerski 
stated for our newspaper, and as the government statement made 
clear, the government is doing everything it can to ease the 
situation after the blockade. Soon, a meeting will be organized 
with Bulgarian representatives to sign an agreement on a faster 
flow of petrol-carrying vehicles across the border. On the 
other hand, the gas reserves are enough for a 70 days' normal 
supply, diesel fuel for 82, crude oil for 60, and technical gas 
for industry and kerosene for about 30 days. 
<H5>  Alternative Warehouses </H5>
  In the meantime, "Makpetrol" is working continuously on the 
supply of new quantities of derivatives for its itself, and for 
the Skopje Refinery. Thus, Ljubomir Janev, the general manager, 
told us that an agreement has been already signed, and has 
already been put in action, with the Bulgarian partners for the 
supply of 10,000 metric tons of gas and diesel fuel, and for 
3,000 tons of kerosene and technical gas. Between 50 and 70 
petrol-carrying vehicles cross the Novo Selo border daily. In 
order to facilitate the increased number of crossings of 
vehicles carrying derivatives, it was agreed with the Interior 
Ministry and the Customs Service to only use the Novo Selo 
crossing. 
  After the blockade, some 52,000 tons of crude oil remained 
in 
the warehouses of "Jet Oil" and "Mamiddakis" in Thessaloniki, 
31,000 tons of which are the property of "Makpetrol" and 21,000 
tons belonging to the refinery. The value of the "plunder" is 
about 7 million dollars, therefore the owners of the oil 
("Makpetrol" and the Skopje Refinery) insisted on the release of 
the oil in a letter to the owners of the warehouses. According 
to their agreement, when the crude oil has been accepted and 
paid for, its loading and shipment to the users is guaranteed. 
However, as we found out, the "answer" was that the owners of 
the warehouses "are sorry, but we have to respect the government 
decision." 
  As far as alternative warehouses are concerned, as we found 
out, efforts are underway to activate two tanks of 5,000 tons 
located in Vlora--Albania. There is not enough space in Drac to 
store oil derivatives for Macedonia, and there have been 
discussions with "Albatrans" about the two tanks in Vlora as an 
alternative, which should now be emptied! If agreement is 
reached, the tanks will be lent to the Macedonian distributors. 
This alternative is quite favorable, because it could provide 
derivatives from the Rijeka Refinery, which is very eager to 
cooperate with "Makpetrol" and the Skopje refinery. In that way 
it would be possible to have lower transport costs, and even 
better, this alternative route for derivatives could be reopened. 
  Anyway, trouble caused by the blockage on the southern oil 
route has contributed to the reopening of the eastern and 
western transport corridors, which were looked on in the past as 
a reserve that few wanted to become the main distributing 
routes. However, now that it has become an imperative, it did 
not turn out to be very difficult; it was just another 
confirmation that life goes on, even without the southern 
crossing.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Basic Human Rights Violated"] </F>
  [Text] The Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] Foreign Ministry expresses the concern and 
bitterness of itself and the Macedonian public about the latest 
agency reports that the Australian Government is preparing to 
implement the decision to name the Macedonian community living 
in Australia as "Slav-Macedonian." 
  The Macedonian Government does not intend to interfere in 
the 
internal affairs of any country, and in this case Australia, but 
it feels the need to emphasize that by such an act the 
Australian Government is violating the basic human rights of 
loyal Australian citizens of Macedonian origin. By that act, 
with the force of law, solutions are being imposed that are the 
opposite of the generally accepted and successfully implemented 
multinational policy of Australia, thus directly transferring 
the misunderstandings and conflicts from the Balkans to the 
decades-long peaceful multicultural milieu of Australia. It is 
hard to understand that, with an legal act of the Australian 
Government, the positive practice of Australia in this field is 
being violated. That practice was, with its results, an example 
of solving the multinational questions not only on the 
Australian continent, but at large. Those positive experiences 
have been studied and supported with great sympathy by the 
Republic of Macedonia. 
  After the recent violent terrorist acts against the 
buildings 
of the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian community 
in Australia, which caught the attention of the world's public, 
the Macedonian Foreign Ministry officially drew the Australian 
side's attention to the unacceptable reasons for such terrorist 
activities and the possible consequences, and requested urgent 
action by the Australian state in detecting and punishing those 
who endanger the order and peace of the prosperous multicultural 
Australian society. 
<H5>  [Box, p 1] </H5>
<H5>  Protest of the Macedonians in Australia </H5>
  Sydney, 13 March--According to the announcements of the SBS 
Radio Broadcast in the Macedonian language, the Federal 
Government has ordered all its institutions to refer to the 
Macedonians as Slav Macedonians in the future. The Macedonian 
community reacted strongly to this decision, and Chris Popov, 
Goce Stefanovski, as well as some other influential 
personalities in television stated that "if Australia does not 
change this incomprehensible decision, the Macedonians will 
embark on mass demonstrations...."

  [Text] An expanded plenum of the Supreme Council and 
parliamentary faction of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] 
took place in Sofia today. The participants discussed the draft 
program of the forthcoming 41st BSP Congress. This is how BSP 
leader Zhan Videnov assessed today's plenum: 
  [Begin Videnov recording] I am very satisfied with the 
results of today's open and expanded plenum. The party 
obviously has a good potential that allows it to generate ideas 
of a really profound and programmatic essence and discuss them 
in a calm and civilized manner. I hope that when the drafts, 
which have already been prepared, are soon published, this style 
of debate will be transferred to the entire party and society. 
We are prepared to calmly discuss the results of this plenum at 
the congress. [end recording] 
  The Alliance for Social Democracy was the only faction 
within 
the BSP that presented its own draft program for the forthcoming 
congress. Chavdar Kyuranov, chairman of the Alliance for Social 
Democracy, assessed today's plenum in the following manner.: 
  [Begin Kyuranov recording] Something very important took 
place at today's plenum. The plenum steered itself toward 
adopting a very democratic decision --to form a commission that 
will work on the draft programs and produce a uniform proposal 
for the program. This decision differs from previous decisions 
on the same matter. As far as our program is concerned, I have 
a technical explanation. We were able to submit our draft 
rather late. It was disseminated only this morning, so we could 
not ask the plenum participants to express their opinions on our 
draft program. [end recording]

detained at the regional Internal Affairs Ministry Directorate. 
The captain of the vessel is Konstantin Stoyanov, 49, from Ruse. 
  REUTER disseminated a photograph accompanied by a text that 
recalls the history of the vessel's strange trip. This means 
that tomorrow Bulgaria's name will be on the front page of every 
major newspapers in the world. The UN Security Council will

  [Text] At the Vidin Regional Directorate of Internal 
Affairs, investigators of the National Investigation Service are 
now questioning the 21 persons found on board the ship Khan 
Kubrat and held under arrest. An official source from the Vidin 
police announced this at a news conference today. Following 
questioning, 18 of the 21 persons were released. The three 
remaining in custody for further questioning are the ship's 
captain Kostadin Stoyanov, 39, from Ruse; the captain's first 
mate, Atanas Denchev, also from Ruse; and the engineer, Dimitur 
Krumov. 
  The only woman found on board was the wife of one of the 
members of the crew and holds a seaman's passport, Nikolay 
Dechev, chief of the Vidin police, announced at the news 
conference. In my personal opinion, the story of the hijacking 
of the Khan Kubrat by armed persons is a put-on, he added. The 
regional police chief said that the entire operation of 
detaining the vessel at 1500 on 13 March was carried out 
superbly and that the organization had worked perfectly. 
  The National Investigation Service opened an investigation 
into the case on 8 March, and its investigations will extend to 
several regions: Vidin, Pleven, Blagoevgrad, and Ruse. Nikolay 
Dechev believes that the investigation into the Khan Kubrat 
incident will be concluded fairly soon.

the Bulgarian vessel the Khan Kubrat. Despite the initial 
promises of assistance made by the responsible Serbian bodies 
and their assurances that the vessel and its cargo were under 
control, the fuel cargo is being discharged from the Khan Kubrat 
barge train. 
  The Foreign Ministry insists that the unloading operation 
should be stopped immediately and the ship returned to Bulgaria 
together with its cargo and crew. 
  The commander of a military patrol launch belonging to the 
Western European Union has reported to the State Navigation 
Inspectorate in Vidin that at about 2200 hours [2000 GMT] this 
evening the Khan Kubrat vessel is expected to arrive in the port 
of Vidin together with its crew. The monitoring bodies have 
made arrangements for the reception of the vessel.

of the Democratic Union of Bulgarians in Yugoslavia led by Ivan 
Grigorov, chairman of the Union. 
  During the meeting, which was attended by Asparukh Panov, 
deputy chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] on 
foreign policy issues, the guests imparted information related 
to the crude violation of the rights of the Bulgarian minority 
in the spheres of religion, education, use of their native 
tongue, and preserving cultural and historical heritage. Alarm 
was expressed over the attempts to ban the Democratic Union of 
Bulgarians in Yugoslavia, officially forcing the Bulgarians to 
adopt Serbian names and disseminating the thesis of the 
existence of a Serbian-Shop [Bulgarian Sofia region peasant] 
nation. 
  The possibilities of rendering practical help on the part of 
the SDS in the sphere of training pupils, students, and graduate 
students were discussed. The SDS committed itself to defending 
the rights of the Bulgarians in Yugoslavia in accordance with 
the international documents. 
  The Democratic Union of the Bulgarian in Yugoslavia invited 
an official SDS delegation to visit the regions of Bosilegrad 
and Tsaribrod in the near future.

discuss issues of European security. In response to our 
question whether the issue of violating the embargo along the 
Danube River will be discussed, Mr. Poos said that this is not 
the basic goal of his visit, but the issue will be discussed 
anyway. Nevertheless, we do not consider Bulgaria responsible 
for the recent incidents, he stressed. 
  The guest said that at the last meeting of the Western 
European Union in Luxembourg on the ministerial level, it was 
decided to grant Bulgaria an enhanced status, which will 
practically make it an associated member of the Western European 
Union. 
  Mr. Poos will also be received by President Zhelyu Zhelev 
tomorrow.

  [Text] The Western European Union does not consider 
Bulgaria guilty of the incident with the Khan Kubrat vessel, 
Jacques Poos, deputy prime minister and minister of foreign 
affairs of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, said during his 
conversation with President Zhelyu Zhelev. 
  Valentin Stoyanov, spokesman for the president, informed the 
journalists that, during the talks, the situation in the Balkans 
was discussed, and more specifically, the situation in former 
Yugoslavia. 
  The Bulgarian head of state again confirmed our steady 
position regarding the observance of the embargo and declared 
that an incident such as the one with the Khan Kubrat vessel is 
not something strange against the background of the situation 
that exists at present in the Balkans. 
  We suffer not only because of the economic losses related to 
the embargo, but also because of the emergence of such forces, 
which act in a provocative manner against Bulgaria's interests, 
the president said. 
  Prior to his departure Mr. Poos gave a news conference, at 
which he summarized the results of his meetings with President 
Zhelev, Deputy Prime Ministers Evgeni Matinchev and Valentin 
Karabashev, and Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. 
  [Begin Poos recording in French fading into Bulgarian 
translation read by the announcer] This was a bilateral visit, 
but it immediately engulfed all European subjects, which were 
invoked in all the talks. We witnessed Bulgaria's ambition to 
most rapidly join the European structures, which was evident in 
all the talks I had here. I have the opinion that the steps 
related to ratifying the trade agreement with the European Union 
and the reform in your legislature, that already began, will 
facilitate this process, Mr. Poos said. He stressed that the 
protocol on the agreement to exchange the ratification 
documents, that was signed at the Foreign Ministry, will give an 
impetus to developing bilateral relations between Bulgaria and 
Luxembourg.

Rakovski BOL Statute, and the Basic Premises for Mutual 
Relations Between the Defense Ministry and the Rakovski BOL. It 
is pointed out that Captain Second Rank Vasil Denov, acting 
independently and without the knowledge of his colleagues in the 
legion's Confederative Council and speaking through the mass 
media, took it upon himself to compare the appeal by the 
officers in Khaskovo to "the Bloody Letter" [letter written in 
blood announcing the 1876 April Uprising against the Turks]. By 
doing this, quite apart from committing a grave disciplinary 
offense, he caused additional tension among the public and 
indirectly issued a provocative call for appropriate action. 
  For committing these disciplinary offenses and with a view 
to 
forestalling actions by Bulgarian Army commissioned and 
noncommissioned officers in the future that contravene the 
legally based and statutory order established in the Army, 
Captain Second Rank Vasil Denov is dismissed on disciplinary 
grounds and various punishments are imposed on the other 
officers that signed the appeal and the petition.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Evgeni Gavrilov: "Berov Stepped on Firm </F>
Ground"] 
  [Text] The statement of Prime Minister Lyuben Berov to the 
mass media on 1 March in effect showed that the government views 
the 1994 budget, which was adopted late on 28 February, as the 
most important vote of confidence that it has received in just 
over a year. Unfortunately, the budget was adopted at the last 
minute, under pressure, in a typical Bulgarian manner. Pressed 
by the time limit posed by the international financial 
institutions as a precondition of allocating to Bulgaria the 
still illusionary $1 billion, the deputies and ministers had no 
choice but to dispose quickly of the matter of adopting the 
budget, which is the most important law of any normal state. 
  Generally, the government received the parameters of the 
macroeconomic budget framework that it demanded. However, it is 
clear to all that this framework is unrealistic and unfeasible. 
Everyone knows that the emperor is naked, but no one dares to 
admit this publicly. The dollar rate, which was artificially 
kept within decent limits, immediately reached 40 leva on the 
real market. The budget's income and expenditure are calculated 
on the basis of a $1/35 leva rate. There is hardly one normal 
Bulgarian citizen who believes in the inflation of 45 percent 
promised by the end of the year and a basic interest rate of 30 
percent. After all, every week there is another official price 
increase--electricity, heating, postal services, and so forth. 
The citizens, subjected to the price racket of the official and 
unofficial government, do not appear to have any choice. 
  The 1994 budget contains more restrictions than the budgets 
of the last four years. Three governments have publicly 
announced that they will serve in the name of the reform, but 
they have all limited themselves to the monetary part of the 
reform proposed by (former Finance Minister) Ivan Kostov. 
Otherwise, in his statement, Prime Minister Berov did not say 
anything new regarding supporting private and state business, 
and socially supporting the poor, whose number continues to 
grow. He did not make any promises. Basically, the present 
cabinet can afford this. It stands on relatively solid ground 
that materialized under its feet with the adoption of the 
budget, regardless of how impossible it will be to implement.

  [Text] Ankara--The ethnic Turkish population in Bulgaria 
has decreased during the last three years because of the exodus 
to Turkey, the ANATOLIA NEWS AGENCY reported on Tuesday. 
According to official statistics, 250,000 people have moved 
into Turkey over this period. 
  The exodus has been particularly severe in Southern Bulgaria 
and in the town of Kircali 50 percent of the population have 
left for Turkey. 
  The immigrants mostly enter Turkey on tourist visas although 
some cross the border illegally. The Bulgaria Rights and 
Freedoms movement representative in Kircali, Talat Coban, said 
that if the present trend continues the Turkish presence in 
Bulgaria would soon disappear. Mustafa Omer, mayor of the town 
of Kosukavak, stated on Tuesday that 50 Turkish villages in the 
region were now almost empty and added, "There are only a few 
old people remaining and even they are only waiting for a signal 
from their relatives in Turkey to leave the villages."

  [Text] The reduction in deliveries of Russian natural gas 
to Turkey along the pipeline through Ukraine, Romania, and 
Bulgaria was the reason for an unexpected visit to Sofia today 
by Veysel Atasoy, Turkish minister of energy and natural 
resources. 
  At a meeting with Nikita Shervashidze, chairman of the 
Bulgarian Committee on Power Supplies, they discussed the 
situation and adopted a decision that Mr. Shervashidze will now 
explain to us: 
  [Begin Shervashidze recording] Mr. Atasoy told me that 
Russia 
has declared that it is delivering the contracted amounts of gas 
to the Ukrainian border, and I have no reason not to believe 
this. He said that the amounts of gas delivered have to be 
divided between Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria, and --the 
fact is that, according to Mr. Atasoy, no gas is arriving at the 
border with Turkey, the last consumer in the line. There is no 
reason for me not to believe this. [words indistinct] 
  The simple fact is that if the amount of gas delivered is 
reduced and the gas pressure falls to a point that we are able 
to monitor, a switching valve automatically comes into operation 
that reduces the amount of gas sent on to Bulgaria or to Turkey. 
However, owing to the peculiarities of the system, Turkey gets 
a larger share of the gas than Bulgaria does. As we assured our 
Turkish colleagues--and we also wrote to them to avoid being 
accused of not fulfilling our promises--that we will take 
measures, including restrictions, I regret to say, to ensure 
that we each get a fair share of the gas and that we divide the 
available gas like good neighbors. [end recording] 
  With a view to dividing the quantities of natural gas 
arriving more fairly between Bulgaria and Turkey, Bulgaria will 
take technical measures. Our country is already restricting the 
consumption of natural gas by enterprises in the chemical 
industry. Because of force majeure conditions, as Nikita 
Shervashidze described them, we will suffer losses that are not 
our fault.

  [Text] On 1 and 2 March the Defense Ministry leadership 
held working meetings with commanders and officers of the 1st, 
2d, and 3d Armies. 
  These meetings discussed a wide range of problems stemming 
from the need to continue the reform in the Armed Forces 
following the adoption of the budget. In a special session, the 
leaderships of the Defense Ministry and the General Staff made a 
comprehensive analysis of the issues raised by servicemen during 
the above meetings. The most severe problems are finding rented 
living accommodation for officers on the free market, and the 
prospects as regards pay and housing policy. This issue of 
improved everyday conditions for the soldiers also awaits a 
solution. Particular attention was paid to the need to speed up 
structural reform in the Armed Forces. 
  The Defense Ministry leadership expressed the conviction 
that 
the defining of clear prospects for the Army in the future is of 
decisive importance as regards motivating the personnel and 
increasing the combat readiness of the Armed Forces. 
  Notwithstanding the limited budget possibilities, the 
minister of defense has ordered proposals to be prepared on 
solving the most pressing problems. 
  The session also examined offenses committed by certain 
servicemen against the military statutes and army discipline.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major Rusi Gochev, leader of the Rakovski </F>
Bulgarian Officers Legion, by Nikolay Grudev; place and date 
not given: "Rusi Gochev: Defense Ministry Invented Officers' 
Putsch"] 
  [Text] [Grudev] Major Gochev, has the officers' legion's 
putsch ended? 
  [Gochev] I think that the conflict was invented in and 
staged by the Ministry of Defense. The scandal was prompted by 
collecting signatures for our petition. It started at the 
Khaskovo Garrison. However, our petition did not attack the 
ministry or the government. It was intended for parliament and 
invoked not only the budget, but also the Law on the Defense and 
Armed Forces. 
  [Grudev] However, the Army budget was adopted and the 37 
billion leva requested by the legion was not allocated.... 
  [Gochev] It is mere rumor that we requested 37 billion leva. 
The almost 13 billion that were allocated is the defense 
minister's problem. Parliament has in effect refused to assume 
responsibility for the situation in the Armed Forces and for the 
defense of the state. The buck was passed to the Ministry of 
Defense and not without the help of the new members of the 
minister's cabinet. 
  [Grudev] Whom do you have in mind? 
  [Gochev] Deputy Minister Boyko Noev. 
  [Grudev] What responsibility do you mean? 
  [Gochev] According to the existing law the Armed Forces' 
payroll is determined by the Council of Ministers following the 
proposal of the Defense Ministry. Now I understand why the 
parliament was not in a hurry to adopt the new Law on Defense. 
According to the draft law it is the National Assembly that 
should determine the size of the Army. This awkward issue was 
transferred to the executive. 
  [Grudev] The legion has been accused of requesting higher 
wages for the officers through a higher budget. 
  [Gochev] In our petition we do not mention at all any 
request for higher wages. However, a bigger budget would 
facilitate the improvement of the Bulgarian military's social 
situation. Nevertheless, this is not the most important issue. 
  We demand kerosene so that our aircraft can fly and continue 
their training. We demand money for properly functioning 
equipment and for improving the Army's combat ability. 
  [Grudev] Who is interested in this? 
  [Gochev] Obviously, there are political forces interested in 
the future development of the Armed Forces. The experts know 
the price of preserving the army and they have expressed their 
opinion. Perhaps this irritated many people. 
  Now Deputy Defense Minister Boyko Noev has said several 
times 
that Bulgaria does not need an army of more than 55,000 
soldiers. This is absurd. Against the background of this 
position I do not know whether this is precisely what the new 
budget was aiming at. I do not know whose policy this is. 
However, those who adhere to it should publicly explain their 
position. The defense minister should ask his deputy, Noev, 
what and whose this policy is. 
  [Grudev] What do you intend to do with your petition? How 
many signatures have you collected? 
  [Gochev] Before the holidays it had been signed by 3,200 
officers and sergeants. We have stopped counting. Now we 
expect the penalties. The accusations of planning a putsch have 
evaporated. Now we will ask those who accused us to apologize 
publicly. 
  [Grudev] Will the petition be handed to parliament as you 
promised? 
  [Gochev] This is absurd in the existing situation. Those 
who signed the petition signed it with their three names, their 
military serial number, and the unit in which they serve. We 
cannot be sure that someone will not decide to begin the 
"reform" by dismissing those who have signed the petition. So 
we will only announce the final number of those who have signed 
the petition. 
  [Grudev] How will the legion act if there are cuts in the 
Army? 
  [Gochev] In any event, we will insist that those who will be 
dismissed from the Armed Forces for various reasons will be 
granted all forms of security provided in law. We have already 
heard that instead of the financial compensation that they are 
entitled to, they will receive securities. The officers are 
already calling these "pieces of paper." This would be the 
ultimate mockery of the Army.
