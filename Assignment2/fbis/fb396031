  [Text] Belgrade, 11 Mar (TANJUG)--Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic today received Karolos Papoulias, minister of 
foreign affairs of friendly Greece and the current president of 
the EU Council of Ministers, and his associates. 
  During the course of their meeting, which passed in an 
atmosphere of mutual openness and understanding, they spoke 
about the current EU policy toward the peace process and the 
resolution of the crisis on the territory of former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and also about Serbia-Greece bilateral 
relations and cooperation, the Serbian president's office has 
announced. 
  It was concluded that a fair and permanent solution to the 
situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina could be reached only if 
the peace option prevailed over the war option and if the 
international community displayed an unbiased attitude and 
readiness to treat equally the rights and interests of all the 
three warring sides in this area. 
  President Milosevic stressed that the European Union had a 
huge political obligation with regard to lifting the sanctions 
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, in light of the fact 
that the Serb side has accepted its peace plan, the integral 
part of which is the lifting of the embargo. The European Union 
ought to fulfill its part of the obligations from that plan, 
particularly because it is impossible to resolve the crisis in 
this area without equal treatment of all the sides by the 
international community. 
  It was also stressed that maintaining sanctions against our 
country encourages those forces that are trying to realize their 
goals by force. It is of vital interest for all the countries 
suffering damage caused by the application of the economic 
blockade against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to launch an 
initiative as soon as possible for the lifting of the embargo. 
This is in the interest of the normalization of economic trends 
and the overall stabilization of the political situation in the 
region, in which the European Union should play an active role. 
  It was stressed that bilateral relations between Serbia and 
Greece were developing well despite the imposed limitations, 
which confirms the firm friendship and shared interests of the 
Serbian and the Greek nations. 
  The talks were also attended by Federal Deputy Prime 
Minister 
Zeljko Simic.

  [Text] Belgrade, 11 Mar (TANJUG)--During the talks in 
Belgrade today Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and [Greek] 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias said that the EU [European 
Union] plan for the settlement of the crisis in former 
Yugoslavia should remain in force. 
  They also agreed that the abolition of sanctions against the 
FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] must be seriously examined, 
given that the Serbian side has met all conditions regarding 
this plan. 
  Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic also took part 
in 
the talks that lasted two and a half hours. 
  In a statement for the press, Papoulias assessed the talks 
as 
useful and said his impression was that he would "return" to his 
colleagues in the EU "with very nice messages." Simic said that 
the talks were "exceptionally open and fruitful." 
  "The thinking prevailed during the talks that any form of 
discrimination at this stage--when one of the sides involved in 
the conflict is being pushed aside--cannot politically be either 
appropriate or effective," stressed Simic. 
  "The EU plan remains in force and I think that this plan is 
the core of any new initiative or action," said Papoulias. 
  In this context "the question of abolishing the sanctions is 
very significant," he said, adding that the stand of Greece on 
this subject was well-known and Greece was sticking by it. 
  Papoulias explained that Greece, as the chairman of the EU 
Council of Ministers, ought to reassure its partners that the 
question of sanctions should be examined both in general and in 
the case of Yugoslavia, in particular. 
  "If in principle the abolition of the sanctions contributes 
to a peaceful settlement of this crisis, this question ought to 
be examined seriously," the Greek foreign minister pointed out. 
  "Yugoslavia was particularly pleased with the fact that in 
Greece, which is the current president of the European Union, 
our view on the futility of the sanctions and the damage that 
the sanctions have inflicted on the neighboring countries and 
the entire Balkan Peninsula enjoys support," Simic stressed. 
  "It is well-known that the Serb side has fully complied with 
all the EU conditions that were set several months ago, 
including the territorial concessions in Bosnia-Herzegovina," he 
recalled, "but the EU reneged on its obligation to alleviate or 
lift the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia." 
  The Yugoslav deputy prime minister said that "the 
application 
of sanctions against anyone at the end of 20th century is an 
anachronistic act." 
  "In our opinion the only way to restore a permanent peace is 
to apply those democratic principles advocated by Greece since 
the very outset of the crisis on the territory of former 
Yugoslavia," Simic said. 
  According to him, these are three elementary principles: a 
cessation of all hostilities, negotiations that have to be based 
on democratic principles, and respect of the will of all three 
sides and the search for a solution that will not be to the 
detriment of any of the warring sides. 
  Papoulias announced that the Bosnian crisis will be the main 
topic of a EU ministerial meeting on 26th and 27th March in 
Athens, adding that details will be discussed at the meeting and 
decisions adopted "as required by the current situation." 
  Asked about Greece's reaction to Turkey's attempts to send 
its forces to former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Papoulias reiterated 
his country's well-known position that neighboring countries 
should not send their troops as peacekeepers. 
  However, violations of this principle--accepted by both NATO 
and the European Union--would create a new situation and in such 
a case Greece would reach new decisions aimed at defending 
national and broader regional interests, Papoulias explained. 
  Asked whether relations with The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia [FYROM] were discussed, Papoulias replied that "the 
issue of relations with the Skopje republic was reviewed from 
all angles. Mr. Milosevic--and this is no secret--is expressing 
great interest in the resolution of the crisis in the relations 
between Greece and Skopje," he said. 
  The talks also focused on the overall situation created by 
the meddling of nonBalkan countries in the Balkan crisis. "All 
who wish to contribute to a peaceful resolution are welcome, but 
they should not complicate matters even further," Papoulias said. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Simic added that the talks also 
covered 
bilateral issues and the development of the traditionally good 
relations between Greece and Yugoslavia. He thanked Papoulias 
for his personal contribution to the resolution of the crisis in 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Greek Government "which 
acknowledged political reality and advocated principles in the 
spirit of ancient Greece" since the beginning of the crisis in 
the region of former Yugoslavia. 
  After a luncheon with his hosts, the Greek foreign minister 
left Belgrade for Athens.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias concluded his 
talks in Belgrade with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on 
the Bosnian issue. After their meeting, Mr. Papoulias described 
the talks as successful and expressed the hope that the crisis 
will be overcome. He further noted that his meeting with Mr. 
Milosevic was very useful and announced that the European 
Union's [EU] plan for the settlement of the Bosnian crisis 
remains the nucleus of talks. 
  Responding to a question if Greece would change its stance 
and become involved in the Balkan crisis if Turkey became 
involved in the crisis, Mr. Papoulias said: Greece's position 
remains that the Balkan peoples should not be involved in this 
crisis. However, if this principle is violated then a new state 
of affairs is created and our country should make new decisions 
in accordance with its own interests as well as the region's 
interests. 
  The foreign minister also added that in our capacity as EU 
presidency, we should convince, as he put it, others on the 
examination and decision, in principle, on lifting the trade 
embargo against Yugoslavia. If the lifting of the embargo will 
contribute toward a peaceful process then these questions must 
certainly be addressed. Mr. Papoulias further noted that he 
discussed with Slobodan Milosevic the situation in Skopje [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] and the 
intervention in the Balkan crisis by forces that are not related 
to the region. Mr. Papoulias made it clear that the moves by 
other, non-Balkan countries for a peaceful solution of the 
problem are welcome, without this meaning involvement in the 
problem. 
  Mr. Papoulias is now attending a working luncheon being 
hosted in his honor by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. 
  The two-day visit to Russia, which Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias was to begin today, has been postponed because of his 
Russian counterpart's departure for Israel.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Stefan Grubac] </F>
  [Excerpts] Had those who started the war in the former 
Yugoslavia cared about peace, it would have been accomplished 
relatively quickly and, above all, naturally by offering a just 
peace and by treating all the warring sides equally. However, 
because the interests of the big and powerful come before the 
interests of those whom the war directly affects, the big and 
powerful pursue their policy not in the interest of those who 
are affected by the war but to their own benefit. 
  We recently had a chance to see what kind of interests are 
intertwined here from a seemly banal fact. Namely, Saudi Arabia 
purchased from the United States $6 billion worth of new 
aircraft for its aircraft carrier. High-level Saudi officials 
signaled to the Europeans that they have not done enough for the 
Muslims in Bosnia. France--which wanted to--failed in striking 
a deal to sell its own aircraft. In place of such a reprimand, 
the United States was rewarded with an enormous financial deal 
in which President Clinton was personally engaged. By the way, 
Saudi Arabia is an Islamic country that financially assists the 
Bosnian Muslims the most. 
  Let us now reexamine the relations between the Unites States 
and Western Europe and the United States and Russia. These 
relations are also being mutually reexamined and reshaped 
precisely on the issue of the war in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has transpired that Western Europe--that 
is, the European Union--for a long time failed to contribute 
toward a solution for the Balkan war zone. Therefore, the 
United States has taken the initiative, more to demonstrate to 
the European Union that it is not capable of resolving such a 
problem than to actually solve the problem, and even less to 
solve it justly. The political message is clear. Europe is not 
capable of resolving such conflicts by itself and the presence 
of the United States is inevitable. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking about the sanctions, let us recall that Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic in a meeting with Greek diplomacy 
chief Karolos Papoulias actually sent a message to the European 
Union saying that it has a great political obligation to abolish 
the sanctions against FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], 
keeping in mind that the Serbian side had accepted its peace 
plan, a component of which is also an abolition of the embargo. 
Prolongation of the sanctions against our country encourages 
precisely those forces that aspire to accomplish their goals by 
war, the Serbian president emphasized. 
  As the time is advancing, there is less belief in the 
Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia, as well as a confederation 
of this federation and Croatia. Does this not mean that instead 
of a practical step toward peace, an illusion has been created 
among the international public that the United States is trying 
to do something--that is, paving the way to force the Serbian 
side, primarily politically but if possible also militarily, 
into new territorial concessions. There are increasingly more 
facts that suggest that this is the true aim of this agreement. 
Izetbegovic says he would need 60 percent of the territory. The 
international media assess that the Muslim side would be 
satisfied with 50 percent or even less territory of the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. In any case, Izetbegovic has doubled his 
tactics to accomplish this goal. He is faking political 
cooperativeness in front of the world, as instructed by his 
tutors, but simultaneously does not hide new military offensive 
actions against the Serbian positions. 
  On the other hand, Croatian President Tudjman in his 
apparent 
cooperativeness wants to take advantage of the expiry of yet 
another United Nations Protection Force mandate for new threats 
and not only that to the republic of Serbian Krajina. 
  Regardless of everything, it is increasingly more difficult 
for the international public to invent endless lies about what 
is happening in the former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by M. Brkic: "German Mark--1.5 Dinars"] </F>
  [Text] The Yugoslav dinar continued to lose its value 
yesterday. BORBA has learned from reliable dealers' circles 
that the value of one German mark was between 1.42 and 1.5 
dinars in gray hard-currency transactions between banks, and 
banks and companies. 
  The erosion of the national currency has already been going 
on for 10 days. According to the decision by Dragoslav 
Avramovic, the National Bank president, the National Bank tried 
to intervene on the money and securities market by selling 
state-owned securities the day before yesterday [7 March]. The 
central monetary authority thus tried to prevent the further 
growth of the commercial banks' liquidity since it established 
that the money surplus in bank accounts was enabling the banks 
to pay the difference between the real and the official exchange 
rate. 
  Although the response of the banks to buying state-owned 
securities was good, the devaluation of the dinar was not 
halted. It is considered that the national bank intervention has 
not borne fruit because the cause of devaluation was 
ill-defined. The appearance of the difference between the real 
and the official exchange rate is not a result of the high 
liquidity of banks, but of the mistrust that companies have in 
the program of monetary reconstruction and the economic recovery 
of the country. 
  Representatives of the Federal, Serbian, and Montenegrin 
Governments met with [Federal Prime Minister] Kontic the day 
before yesterday and decided to try to take all possible 
economic steps to stop the devaluation of the national currency. 
Mistrust in the economy is growing from day to day, however, 
which can be seen from the exchange rate of the dinar against 
German mark over the last 10 days. It has constantly been 
falling--from 1.10 to 1.50 dinars for a German mark. Some 
businessmen and banks are pessimistic and predict that the state 
and the national bank could apply an administrative measure. If 
this happens, the prognoses are not favorable. 
  The commodity markets have already responded to the gray 
zone 
in hard-currency transactions. People who went to the market 
during the weekend noticed that the prices of agricultural 
products had risen. Apart from agricultural products, the 
prices of some other products, such as cement, iron, and other 
construction materials as well as ferrous and nonferrous 
metallurgy products had risen by 30 to 40 percent.

  [Text] Serbian policemen yesterday surrounded Ceraj 
village, north of Kosova, for six consecutive hours. Here is a 
report by Shaban Arifaj from Kosova: 
  [Arifaj] More than 200 armed Serbian policemen raided 22 
Albanian families in this village under the pretext of searching 
for arms and Albanian adolescents who abandoned the former 
Yugoslav Army during 1991-92. 
  A report that arrived today from the Kosova Information 
Center and the Council for the Defense of Human Rights and 
Freedoms in Mitrovice stresses that during the siege, the police 
arrested and physically maltreated several people, while many 
others were presented with summons to go to the police station. 
It is reported that the police behaved fiercely against the 
Albanian inhabitants of this village that borders Serbia. The 
expedition finally abandoned the village, taking several hunting 
weapons from the homes of the peasants, who had permission to 
keep the weapons, and threatened that unless the runaway 
adolescents are not handed over, the police violence will not 
cease. 
  Reports from Mitrovice also confirm that the Serbian police 
this morning carried out the third consecutive search for Enver 
Brahimi, from the Tavnik quarter of the city, who has been 
living in Germany for three years now. 
  Meanwhile, the Information Commission of the Kosova 
Democratic Alliance [LDK] first branch in Koder e Trimave in 
Prishtina reports that Nazif and Rexhep Beqiri were seriously 
maltreated at the police station in Dardani of Prishtina under 
the pretext that they were in possession of weapons.

  [Text] Following a special meeting of the Slovak Government 
headed by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, at 1100 in Bratislava 
today, the Government of the Slovak Republic terminated its 
work. Vladimir Meciar briefed newsmen about this development at 
a news conference at the end of the government meeting today. 
He went on to say that none of the members of his cabinet will 
accept the request of President of the Republic Michal Kovac to 
head their ministries until a new government is appointed. 
  In this connection, Vladimir Meciar emphasized that what is 
at issue is not a political position, but the situation that 
results from the constitution which does not prescribe the 
sequence of ministerial moves in the event that a vote of no 
confidence in the prime minister is passed. 
  Based on the government's resolution passed at its meeting 
today, from 18 March the prime minister is recalling all state 
secretaries and heads of departments of individual ministries 
from their posts. 
  According to Vladimir Meciar, those members of his cabinet 
who are not members of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
[HZDS], agreed with the government's resolution concerning the 
refusal to temporarily carry out ministerial functions until the 
new government is appointed. These are: Economy Minister Jan 
Ducky, Interior Minister Jozef Tuchyna, and Defense Minister 
Imrich Andrejcak. While the first two are returning to their 
initial posts--Jan Ducky will be the president of the 
Association of Industry of the Slovak Republic, and General 
Tuchyna is returning to active military service--General 
Andrejcak said that he is joining the HZDS as a protest against 
political practices. 
  Of the three members of the coalition government from the 
Slovak National Party, the former deputy prime ministers Jozef 
Prokes and Marian Andel are returning to the parliament as 
deputies and Jaroslav Paska, who was minister of education and 
science, is said to be going back to his initial job as higher 
education lecturer. 
  Vladimir Meciar acquainted journalists with the contents of 
the two letters he received from the president of the republic 
today. In the first letter, Michal Kovac asks him, as the 
chairman of movement with the largest number of seats in 
parliament, to nominate a representative whom the president can 
delegate to begin negotiating about the composition of the new 
government. If Meciar fails to do it by 1700, the president 
will consider his request to have been refused. 
  Vladimir Meciar is determined to answer the letter in 
writing, adding that he has already expressed his rejection in 
public. He also remarked that it is unusual for the president 
to negotiate with chairmen of other political parties while 
inviting chairman of the parliamentary group to represent the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. Vladimir Meciar said 
it is offensive to the whole movement. 
  Addressing the president, he also said that Michal Kovac was 
publicly dishonest toward the HZDS in his speech in the National 
Council and on several other occasions. He will therefore 
negotiate with him only if the president apologizes. Vladimir 
Meciar continued: The president who does not speak truth before 
the National Council should leave his post. It is his duty. 
Meciar added that the moment a new government is formed, he 
will consider it the president's moral duty to resign. 
  In the second letter, the president of the republic recalled 
Vladimir Meciar from the post of prime minister and abolished 
his duty to temporarily run the Ministry for the Administration 
and Privatization of National Property. At the same time, he 
recalled him from the post of chairman of the State Defense 
Council. At the same time, he thanked him for the work he had 
done in these posts. 
  Vladimir Meciar announced that as from today he is returning 
to parliament as a deputy. Together with him, former ministers 
Olga Keltosova [minister of labor, social affairs, and the 
family] and Katarina Tothova [minister of justice] will join the 
National Council's plenum. 
  Vladimir Meciar said that the government is not disbanded. 
From today, it has begun to work as a shadow cabinet.

  [Text] Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar delivered 
almost a two-hour speech in the Slovak parliament today. 
  In the first part of his speech, he spoke about the results 
achieved by his government. In the second part, he expressed 
his view on his conflict with the president, whose speech of 9 
March led the opposition to propose a vote of no-confidence in 
the government. 
  Vladimir Meciar emphasized that the president had no 
constitutional right to control the government and initiate its 
dismissal. Vladimir Meciar proposed that either the controversy 
should be forgotten or the president should resign. One minute 
after [the president resigns], Meciar would resign as well. 
  Meciar also said that, if no early parliamentary election 
were held by the end of June, a referendum would be carried out, 
as a result of which there might be 90 government deputies in a 
parliament with 150 seats. 
  The prime minister offered alternative solutions to the 
situation: the government staying in power till the early 
elections or an agreement between the political parties or 
forming a coalition with the Party of Democratic Left [SDL]. He 
said that if the Cabinet is dismissed and a new government 
formed, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] would go 
into opposition and its ministers would not take part in the new 
government. 
  Vladimir Meciar warned against the interruption to 
continuity 
should he be dismissed and expressed the belief that, after the 
elections, he would return to government.

<F P=106> [Address by Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar to a </F>
Slovak Parliament session in Bratislava--live] 
  [Excerpts] There have been some calls asking me to take the 
floor and show courage in this way. Let me tell you that 
courage should be shown in the fight against the enemy and the 
Slovak parliament has not been, is not, and will never be an 
enemy for me. [long applause] 
  There has been an agreement on technical matters according 
to 
which a break is to follow the prime minister's speech. Then 
the discussion will be about something else. I was therefore, 
deliberately trying to give time to the members of the 
government and others to enable them to voice their opinions. 
[passage omitted] 
  The debate about confidence or no-confidence in the prime 
minister is a debate about confidence or no-confidence in the 
government as a whole. It is a problem that is worth discussing 
at length because it is not about Meciar. This is about the 
issue of the further strategy of Slovak politics, the further 
path that Slovakia is to follow--because this strategy is 
different. And this is a substantial change that will take 
place. To think disparagingly that this is all about one person 
is not good enough. 
  The president gave an impulse and started this discussion. 
This was a purposeful action, not an accidental one. The 
Slovaks understand the office of president as a symbol of the 
state--which it really is--as an office for which they have a 
sacred respect. It must, however, be also understood that the 
president is an ordinary man, that the Presidential Office is 
only one among institutions within the system, of the other 
constitutional institutions of the state, and it is not the most 
important one. The most important institution is you, the 
deputies. You elect the president, you have the right to check 
on him, you have the right to decide whether he will or will not 
be president. It is your right. You cannot give up this right, 
whatever the sanctity or deification of the president, at a time 
when he is against the government and when he acts against the 
movement in which he used to be its deputy chairman. 
  If you allow me I will not talk about this, but I would like 
to reminisce. [passage omitted] 
  There are no personal disputes between me and Slovak 
Republic 
President Michal Kovac. He is not having an affair with my wife 
and I do not wish to become a president. What personal disputes 
can there be between us? [applause and whistling] At the same 
time, allow me to express my view on his speech [in Slovak 
Parliament on 9 March, criticizing Meciar]. 
  First of all, assessing the structure of the speech, I would 
like to say that no one from the Slovak Republic Government took 
part in its drafting. The president did not ask any one of us 
to give him information to base his speech on or to help him 
with it. He did not consult any one of us--it surprised us just 
as it surprised you--despite our offer, which was repeated 
several times, to give the president anything that he might need 
for writing such a speech. 
  The speech was written from the point of view of a 
presidential system. The letters that the office of the 
republic [as heard] receives and the statement that 99 percent 
of the population is dissatisfied with the overall situation [in 
the country] is not, forgive me for saying so, an objective 
analysis. The president told you off, told us off, reproached 
us for passing too many laws, the quality of which is not very 
good as a result. He positively assessed the work of the 
prosecutor's offices, he did not have any objections against the 
government, with the exception of the prime minister, whom he 
criticized for his working methods, and for his attitude to 
himself, the person of Michal Kovac. 
  He also criticized the political parties and very mildly 
also 
the opposition. [passage omitted] 
  As far as the part of the speech concerning the personal 
relations between the president and the prime minister is 
concerned, and not the state of affairs of the Slovak Republic, 
he [Kovac] bases it on statements allegedly made in one-on-one 
conversations. What can one do when someone uses such arguments? 
The only thing to do is not to have any more one-on-one 
conversations. 
  I refute the statement by the president, according to which 
I 
said that we needed State Secretary Ivan Lexa to be appointed 
minister of privatization so that we could engage in corrupt 
practices. I refute this. We have never talked about this. 
Roman Zelenay was present throughout our conversation. But it 
is not ethical to base one's claim on the testimony of those who 
are dead. But before Zelenay left the castle, he met several 
members of the government and told them about the meeting. They 
are sitting here, you can ask them. The president must be wrong 
about this. 
  As far as the content of the president's speech is 
concerned, allow me to say that the president does not have the 
right to check up on the actions of the Slovak Republic 
Government, does not have the right to initiate, in any way, a 
motion of no-confidence in the government or its members, does 
not have the constitutional initiative, cannot demand the 
resignation of the prime minister. 
  The president does not have the right to assess the actions 
of the National Council of the Slovak Republic. He was elected 
by it and answers to it. The National Council should assess his 
actions. It is the other way round. You failed to notice this, 
just because it [the criticism] was aimed against us. [passage 
omitted] 
  The president calls for political calm and consensus, but, 
forgive me, if he indirectly appeals to the parliament to pass a 
vote of no-confidence in the government, then, it seems to me, 
he does not honestly want the political situation to be calm. 
Most of you in the opposition understood that he called on you 
to do that. 
  The president has significantly contributed to the immediate 
polarization of our society. He does not accept the democratic 
process and the phenomenon of pluralistic elections, according 
to which it is not important whether the government has a 
majority, but what matters is whether the majority allows the 
government to rule. 
  Norway has a minority government for the third term now and 
the country is among the most prosperous in Europe. 
  Today, the mechanism of 86 votes is here, according to which 
you can formally express a vote of no-confidence in the 
government. This is the reality. 
  As for the issues raised by his speech, it is not only the 
president who is a constitutional body. You yourselves are a 
constitutional body and we, the government, are a constitutional 
body, too. Tell me, where else in the world, in which state are 
relations between constitutional bodies being solved in this 
way? Show me another silly place, apart from Slovakia, where 
things are done like this! Things must not be done like this, 
for nowhere else are they approached in this way! From time to 
time there can be clashes between parliaments and government. 
That is quite normal. There were clashes in Hungary, for 
example, between the government and the president. But 
altogether, different ways and means were used to resolve this 
situation. Things must not be done in this way! 
  As far as another issue is concerned, it was not us who 
attacked the president in parliament. It was he who has 
attacked both the prime minister and the chairman of the 
parliament [Ivan Gasparovic]. My view is that the Constitution 
does not give the president the political right to express his 
views on the activities of the cabinet, let alone express his 
views on the methods of constitutional officials' activities. 
This assessment is for the electorate to make and early 
elections would provide an opportunity to make such an 
assessment. Despite the fact that he declares he is above the 
parties, in reality he took sides by delivering his speech. 
  I have stated that I have no personal conflicts or 
misunderstandings with Michal Kovac, I have no personal 
conflicts with anybody. I have working ones, yes. This happens 
often in the course of work. 
  As for issues discussed and not discussed, my views on a 
number of issues differed from those of the president. In the 
foreign policy sphere there was a lack of coordination between 
the work of the National Council and the government. In effect, 
we have spent the whole year asking for this coordination. To 
this day it has not materialized. We proposed to exchange 
reports on our [foreign] trips. I suggested that the president 
provide the government with a report on his trips, so that we 
could use it as a basis for working toward [concluding] 
agreements. We did not intend to check things. [passage 
omitted] 
  We did not receive any reports from his trips at all. I 
cannot say to what extent these trips were successful, because I 
was not there, but I do know what happened during my trips. 
Anyway, this cooperation in our work has been lacking. 
  As to Slovakia's foreign political activity, our views 
differed on a number of subjects. Former Foreign Affairs 
Minister Milan Knazko remarked here in the National Council on 
Lexa's doings in Yugoslavia. Lexa did not go to Yugoslavia, he 
went to Croatia. I asked him to go there and to cancel the 
promise of the president, who was then Federal Assembly speaker, 
that we and Croatia would pursue and coordinate the 
manufacturing and sale of arms. After taking his up post [as 
president], the president once again returned to this matter, 
saying that Austria was to be involved, too. The Austrian press 
wrote about some of these matters, which were then suspended. 
Should any doubts arise, then there is a witness whom I 
instructed to be there. The foreign affairs minister who was 
then also deputy prime minister [Knazko] knew what [Lexa] would 
do there. (?He will remember it later). I handed written reports 
on the subject to the then state secretary [in the Privatization 
Ministry]. 
  We had different views on the recognition of Taiwan when 
the president requested in writing that the matter be resolved 
either by a political or commercial recognition, the upshot 
being that we would receive $5 million. It happened that a 
Baltic country took such a step and received in return nothing, 
but such a thing means immediately a political and international 
conflict with the Chinese People's Republic. I was 
fundamentally against taking such a step, although I was not 
against the president. I wanted the state to acquire dollars, 
but I did not want the state to be involved in an international 
conflict and find itself in international isolation. Is this a 
personal dispute? 
  We equally parted ways in the assessment of our visits to 
the 
Czech Republic. After his talks with President Havel, the 
president returned and asked that we make a settlement amounting 
to 18.2 billion korunas [Sk] regarding the National Property 
Fund and Sk24 billion in settling the deficit in the Czech 
budget. I did not agree. I was not alone when we explained the 
matter to him at the airport. There were a number of us there. 
In the end Sk18.2 billion worth of shares came into Slovakia 
free of charge. The government was right. 
  Regarding the visit to Poland, which you assessed here, only 
after the president's visit did ministers meet and prepare the 
draft of an agenda which both sides would then discuss and 
prepare by the end of March. When you proceed from the premise 
that such treaties were prepared before that visit, then the 
answer is that they were not. We did not infringe on anything 
and behaved correctly towards the president. 
  On the question of the assessment of the visit by President 
Clinton, I personally assess it as a wasted opportunity. We had 
40 minutes for talks. Extensive preparations were made. Before 
the team President Clinton delegated for the visit to the Slovak 
Republic arrived, the president issued a statement to the press 
that Slovakia wanted to be in NATO's political structures. The 
commission which visited our country understood this to be a 
counteralternative, a different proposal, and this is why I 
dissociated myself from it on behalf of the Slovak Republic, 
because that matter had not been consulted with us. It was a 
unilateral statement, and after all, we are jointly responsible 
for foreign policy. 
  An agreement was approved on a joint course of action of the 
delegation in talks with President Clinton. This was an historic 
opportunity which would not be repeated; an opportunity to 
tackle security and economic interests of the Slovak Republic, 
to tackle issues of cooperation and bilateral relations between 
the United States and Slovakia. We worked out very many 
matters, but out of only 40 minutes, 34 were reserved for a 
one-sided speech which the president, acting as the chairman of 
the delegation, delivered. How much time then did I get? I 
asked the foreign minister how much time do I have? He told me 
five minutes and no more. There were reactions from the 
American side which were negative in this regard. Twice there 
was an interruption by a sound signal [as heard]. There was the 
stance of the foreign minister, the stance of Mrs. Albright, the 
stance of President Clinton. I was ashamed and I was not alone; 
we all felt the same in the delegation. This was a wasted 
opportunity. But why not discuss this matter frankly? I do not 
wish to cast a doubt.... [pauses] 
  Why were agreements not implemented? We drew up important 
documents that were key for the Slovak Republic. When will a 
delegation of the Slovak Republic be received again in such a 
favorable atmosphere and in such a composition? 
  Regarding matters of protocol, in reality these discussions 
did not take place on several occasions with the president, but 
he always was represented by a deputy prime minister. It was 
either a prime minister or a deputy prime minister. This is not 
against protocol. The same applies to the chairman of the 
National Council. It was either he personally, or a deputy 
chairman of the National Council, who represented the president. 
We have never permitted ourselves to not show respect to the 
president and not meet him. But when a visit takes place, for 
instance, in the course of government's meeting, then a deputy 
prime minister leaves and the prime minister continues in the 
government meeting. If by a chance an announcement about the 
president's departure comes several hours before fundamental 
questions are to be discussed, during which the prime minister's 
personal attendance is essential, then a deputy prime minister 
goes. Is this the reason for parliament to discuss the matter? 
[passage omitted] 
  Concerning ethnic minorities, the president asked the 
government for any material relating to ethnic minorities. We 
were never invited to take part as partners in the roundtable. 
Only political parties were invited, although the government had 
a plan ready. We could not accept the situation which had 
arisen, for example, in connection with the law on place names 
and surnames which we jointly referred back to the National 
Council. After a long debate in parliament, I successfully 
defended the law at the Vienna meeting of Council of Europe 
representatives, who accepted it. It was very frustrating to 
learn that the president referred the law back to the National 
Council for a second time, which he was not constitutionally 
authorized to do. [passage omitted] 
  The Government of the Slovak Republic is not to be blamed. 
The same applies to the law on place names and surnames. One 
concept came up.... [pauses] The Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia cannot create alternatives to government policy. It 
must support it as long as it is in the government and you will 
do the same when you are in the government. It was not 
necessary to promise at the round table that an executive body 
would be set up on a governmental level, because it already 
exists. The Council for Minorities exists. It is not necessary 
to talk about the existence or nonexistence of government 
policy; it is necessary to get to know it. 
  Concerning questions of the relationship with the 
government, 
we shall part the veil slightly although we never intended to do 
so. There were (?talks) with all government members, their 
loyalty to the prime minister was investigated. For example, at 
the Ministry of Culture, a discussion took place in March 1993 
about the possibility of changing the prime minister in autumn 
1993. These talks were also held with other government members. 
They sit here, they can confirm it if you want to know. It is 
not the usual way in which the president of the state should go 
about his business. Only you can decide if I am going to be the 
prime minister or not and you must not permit anybody to take 
this right away from you. 
  Concerning personnel issues, I also think that president 
cannot take over the role of the prime minister by negotiating 
with ministers about who will leave what ministry for which 
different ministry. Only I am entitled to make similar 
proposals. Somebody did not want to respect this right of mine. 
[passage omitted] 
  Regarding the discussions concerning Lexa, Prokes, and the 
like. I do not wish to comment on the matter. It is a very poor 
show. The president has made use of Ivan Lexa's remark that was 
made in private--and I do not know where and in front of whom it 
was made. He said that when the president was elected, Slovakia 
was in shit. Nonetheless, to bring this into the relation with 
the prime minister and start politicking in parliament because 
of that private remark, this does not seem to me either tactful 
or appropriate. 
  As regard the matters concerning relations between Lexa and 
the president, there were certain problems within the Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia. Lexa was right. [laughter] You do 
not know the details of it and yet you are laughing. This is 
good. 
  As regards the proposal about Mr Prokes, excuse me but we do 
have to accept the basic existing institution, which is 
pluralistic democracy. If there is a government coalition in 
power, the prime minister can submit only a candidate endorsed 
by the coalition. And if you form that super-coalition 
government, then you will not be able to submit any proposal to 
the president unless a mutual agreement has been reached on it. 
  It is difficult to accept when somebody is approved to the 
office of deputy prime minister for European integration and at 
the same time is not approved as a minister of foreign affairs. 
Why not? After all, he is already member of the government. He 
is not a new person. Naturally, we did expect some support, 
rather than conflict regarding this matter. 
  The same applies to Ivan Lexa. If the president did not give 
me his word and if he did not tell me in front Mr. Gasparovic 
that he would accept Lexa in the coalition bloc, I would not be 
have put him forward. He, naturally, said in public that he did 
not want Prokes. But if, after this public statement, he did 
not say at the close of our private conversation, that he would 
take some time to consider the matter and that he would consider 
his attitude then we (?would have not proposed him). Half an 
hour after the conversation, his attitude was different. Now he 
is using that incident for politicking. Excuse me but this was 
not aimed against the president. 
  If the government is to be formed by the president as he 
thinks it fit, instead of the coalition in accordance with an 
agreement mutually arrived at, a functional government cannot be 
formed. 
  As regards the issues connected with the government, one can 
have a respect for the office or the person, but the president 
cannot say in any state that he needs a new government that 
would be trusted abroad, since this government enjoys confidence 
abroad. 
  Equally, the president cannot say about the government that 
it does not strive to be the government of all citizens. The 
government does not have to be accepted by all citizens, but its 
conclusions and proposals are binding for all citizens. It is 
the government of the state. 
  Equally, the president cannot ever say without any evidence 
that corruption affects the highest quarters. If it is true, 
why did he not report to the prosecutor general anyone suspected 
of corruption? If it is not true, then he should apologize to 
us. We are not thieves. You may have doubts whether we 
discharge our office in line with your ideas, but we do not 
steal. When there was any doubt and evidence or suspicion about 
any member of the government, I always had it investigated. 
[words indistinct] 
  Equally, the president cannot say the government has lost 
moral credibility. What immoral things have we done? I want 
nothing else but evidence. You can judge us if you wish but 
only in accordance with evidence. Look for evidence. If you do 
not have it, judge us in accordance with an impression we have 
made. 
  As regard the accusations that everyone who works for me is 
somewhat obliged to me regardless of his or her talent, excuse 
me, this is a gross insult to all those who work with me. I 
have never obliged anyone but by the promise of hard work. I 
have never in my life given any advantages above those that are 
due. I demand from everyone only service to the state, service 
to the public, not to spare oneself, and to give all. Not 
everyone has been able to cope with these demands either 
psychologically, physically, or politically. I got goose 
pimples when I received, with a great deal of dilemma, the 
message the president conveyed to me several weeks ago by the 
speaker of the parliament saying that the president enjoyed the 
support of the Armed Forces and the police. What for? 
  As regard to the HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia], 
you do not like the way deputies have been speaking, that many 
of them have been reacting with emotions, that they have been 
reacting to the president's speech differently to how you in the 
opposition understand it, into whose hands it has inevitably 
played. This is a political motive. But our attitude is 
different. After all, he is the man who came from our ranks. 
He is the man to whom we gave 74 of our votes. He is the man 
who enjoyed our confidence. He is the man who always declared 
himself as being my friend and who declared this publicly 
everywhere he went. 
  As regard the questions of the HZDS attitudes, I ask you 
chairmen of parliamentary parties, who of you would tolerate a 
situation in which the president would invite your deputies and 
say to them that he had his own people in your clubs who report 
to him, and therefore; he did not need information from you. 
Who of you would tolerate a situation in which, within your 
movement, he would hold discussions with your deputies or your 
party officials asking them to seek another chairman or another 
prime minister? Among the people who were most frequently in 
cahoots with him for more than three quarters of the year were 
Roman Kovac, Jozef Moravcik, and Ivan Laluha too, who was among 
them for a certain period of time, about three weeks. The 
president simply cooperated with them within our movement for 
three quarters of the year. This is simply not a normal state 
of affairs. Yet this happened. 
  Regarding, attitude to parties, the Constitution says that 
parties are independent from the state. The president is a 
representative of the state. The president of the republic 
cannot interfere in the internal life of a party. Likewise, the 
state does not have the right to interfere in the internal life 
parties. Parties are autonomous in this regard. We did not want 
anything and at the meetings of our leadership, we discussed 
nothing else but how to curb or prevent such an influence within 
the movement. 
  As regard the criticism made at the rally in the Park of 
Culture and Rest, we drew the president's attention to the fact 
that he was not getting good information about what was going 
on. We drew his attention to the fact that those who were 
giving him such information were misleading him. But rallies in 
the Park of Culture and Rest and other meetings held by the HZDS 
took place under Havel's and Carnogursky's rule and will take 
place also under Kovac's. 
  Regarding the crisis we have, it is a crisis of 
personalities 
in the parliament. It is not a crisis of the movement. The 
movement is healthy, ready, and capable of fighting any other 
party in an honest and democratic fight, in the interest of 
future cooperation. 
  On questions concerning the concept of the government's 
activities, there cannot arise a situation, and such a thing 
does not arise from the Constitution, in which the president 
would propose his concept of privatization to be incorporated 
within the government's concept of privatization. This cannot 
happen. There cannot be a situation under which the government 
acts in one way in the Fund of National Property while the 
president acts differently. These are situations which do not 
stem from him his constitutional duties. The constitution sets 
boundaries for competences and cooperation among all 
institutions. If these boundaries are violated, conflicts 
follow and both violation and conflicts have occurred before you 
in the parliament. 
  Regarding the state of our society, I permit myself to 
claim that there does not exist a crisis within the state. 
There is neither a social nor economic crisis in our society 
and there has not been a governmental crisis to date either. 
You have been accusing us of not cooperating enough. But how 
did we pass laws, if not in cooperation with you? You say that 
we have been concentrating power in our hands. How can a 
government, that has had since the very days of assuming office 
a minority in the parliament, concentrate power in its hands. 
We have been able to make progress only in cooperation with 
other parties. 
  The government has never intented to control the judiciary 
and has not interfered in the powers of the judiciary. We form 
the government, but only because people elected us in democratic 
elections. We have not formed the government by cheating. We 
have not recruited deputies from other parties asking them to 
vote for us to enable us to form a government. We went honestly 
into the elections and won the fight and we know that we shall 
also win every future one. [applause] 
  You say that broad-based cooperation should have been 
established. This was not possible, not because we did not want 
it. It is the interests of individual parties that decide such 
cooperation. What choice did we have? In the run up to the 
establishment of our new state, the Party of the Democratic Left 
[SDL] did not want to go with us if the Slovak National Party 
[SNS] was to be our partner, too, and after the establishment of 
the state, the SDL defined clearly its interest. It aimed at 
what I regard to be the correct thing and that is it followed 
its own of political interest, which it is also doing at 
present. [passage omitted] 
  The Christian Democratic Movement [KDH], too, formed its 
attitude to the HZDS autonomously and independently. These were 
not questions relating to the period ending 1 January 93 which 
have prevented cooperation between our two parties. They were 
also questions concerning your attitude after 1 January 1993: 
confrontation with the government, confrontation in localities, 
inability to cooperate with anyone at the district level, 
threats to members of the HZDS. You can claim what you want, but 
that is the picture. If such willingness to cooperate is absent 
in the party structure as a whole and when your party structure 
acts in conflict with the government, how can you come to an 
agreement with it? [passage omitted] 
  I was not imposing confrontation on you. I was asking for 
cooperation. That is why we are saying as late as today that 
the limits of cooperation are hard to come by. The situation is 
similar with regard to the Hungarian parties. The part of their 
policy which is turning into nationalism, intolerance and which 
contains hints of irredentism, is unacceptable to us. Regarding 
the main parts of the policy, it is possible to cooperate with 
you, but you are clearly not going to give up this part of your 
policy just because of us. [passage omitted] 
  As regards the relationship which has developed between the 
president and the government, I am willing to respect the 
Constitution of the Slovak Republic and I am capable of 
respecting it. Providing the president acts within the 
framework of the Constitution, it is possible to forget what has 
taken place here. 
  If he is not prepared to do so, I propose the following. 
Taking into account the fact that a conflict has emerged between 
the leading personalities and that this conflict is damaging to 
our state, it is to detrimental to our state, [I propose] that 
the president of the Republic resign and one minute after that I 
will resign, too. I give you my word on this. I propose that 
both of us face our citizens openly in elections, and attempt to 
gain trust and influence. 
  As for the solution to the situation which has emerged 
today, 
this situation can never be so clear-cut that it prevents it 
from being dealt with in various ways. The first fact that 
exist is that the referendum is underway. The mechanism of the 
referendum has been set in motion. It has been initiated by 
citizens and none of us should be indifferent to the fact that 
15 percent of the voters were in favor of it. If citizens 
matter to us and if we hold them in esteem, we should respect 
their will. Their will says: Let's hold immediate elections. 
Their will says: Put an end to deputies leaving the parties for 
which we voted for other parties, because those of you who left 
will not stay neutral for long. You will end up in 
Carnogursky's camp. [laughter, applause] You have no other 
chance! And if your reason for leaving us was to get Duray 
[chairman of the Hungarian Coexistence movement] and Carnogursky 
into the government, it is up to you to settle the score with 
your leadership and with those who put their trust in you. 
  As regards the matter of a referendum, the possible outcome 
is as follows: Unless elections are held by the end of June a 
referendum will take place. In the case that the referendum's 
outcome is positive in favor of changes, its validity excludes 
the validity of the Constitution, a situation can arise when the 
current government coalition may have 90 votes at its disposal 
by the end of June. [sentence as heard] You do not want this 
but it could happen. You argue that Western Europe is against 
it. Allow me to inform you that certain circles in Western 
Europe permit this as a temporary solution. A temporary 
situation can last for a period of three years, and after three 
years have elapsed the parliament may change the outcome of the 
referendum by passing a constitutional law. 
  As regard to further questions put in the 
referendum--elections and the proof of property--this all is 
capable of being resolved. To seek a mechanism of how to prevent 
direct democracy means to choose a new conflict between a 
representative body and direct democracy, between a 
representative democracy and direct democracy. This, for God's 
sake, we cannot permit. The HZDS will therefore not do anything 
that would question a referendum and the right of citizens to 
hold such a referendum. Please do not ask this from us. We have 
come of the people and will return to them even if we are no 
longer in the government. We will never go against the people. 
  The second possibility that exists is early elections. There 
were three alternatives of elections. An alternative that 
elections take place a year hence, although I said that they 
would not then take place. Then there is the alternative for 
them to take place in November. This is not acceptable. This 
would mean that the political crisis would affect all those 
structures about which I was talking, and that serious damage 
would be done to the economic, social, international, and 
political interests of the state. This is why I ask all of you 
to be in favor of early elections, but in June. 
  It is the state that needs such elections. The Meciar 
government does not need them. Our readiness to hold elections 
is the same as yours. [passage omitted] 
  As regards early elections, we regard them as a key 
democratic process of how to resolve the crisis. In the case 
that early elections are held by the end of June, then the 
mechanism of the referendum could not be set in motion. It 
could not be. 
  As regards the questions connected with what to do next is 
the question of what to do in the period between today's 
parliament session and elections. There are several possible 
alternatives. There is the alternative to which 50 of you 
subscribed--to pass a motion of no confidence in the government. 
In that case there will be a new government, and the HZDS as a 
whole will go into the opposition. Do not expect that any of us 
will become members of the new government, or that you will 
manage to persuade any of us to join the new government. Our 
political bodies have laid down that anyone who would want to 
attempt this [join the new government] that vote of no 
confidence be passed against such person and no member of the 
HZDS can be a member of such a government. There exists an 
agreement of honor among members of the government that in the 
event of a motion of no confidence in the government being 
passed, no one would join the new government. 
  Thus, the vote of no confidence presents a danger that the 
continuity of the current government's work will be completely 
lost. There is also a danger that if the referendum at the end 
of June reinstates our previous numbers in the parliament, we 
will bring this government back. Do not even think, do not even 
consider that we would not do this. 
  As regards the options of staying in government, there are 
three options we consider to be realistic. The first option is 
to preserve the cabinet in its current form until democratic 
elections take place. We give our word to the National Council 
of the Slovak Republic and citizens of the Slovak Republic that 
we will do everything possible in order to have democratic, free 
elections and that the cabinet will cope with organizational and 
technical elements of the campaign in a way that will not be 
detrimental to anyone's interests. We also assume the 
obligation to accept a cross-party agreement on what the cabinet 
will do or not do in the period before the elections, in order 
not to damage your interests. 
  We are also prepared to accept the third [as heard] option. 
According to the third option, it is possible to form a 
three-member coalition--consisting of the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], the Slovak National Party [SNS], and 
the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL]--providing the offer I am 
now publicly making to the SDL to participate in the cabinet is 
accepted. [applause] 
  The following option is not easy because of our relationship 
with our coalition partner, the SNS, but it is the result of 
their free decision and their own, free considerations that they 
do not want to become an obstacle to a wider political 
agreement. I am unhappy doing this, but I am doing it because I 
am aware of the political realities: I am also offering the 
option according to which it would be possible to form a 
coalition between the HZDS and the SDL, which could be formed 
immediately on the basis of a reorganization of the cabinet, and 
does not need to lead to the dismissal of the current cabinet. 
Such a cabinet would also be considered a temporary cabinet and 
its main task would be to prepare free and democratic elections 
for all as soon as possible. 
  I have stated the reasons for our not offering a coalition 
to 
other political entities. In Slovakia there is a crisis of 
democracy, excuse me, a climate of democracy, I should say. 
[laughter and applause] The government has not acted against 
anyone for views that were voiced. The only one against whom 
criminal proceedings were launched in the republic is Ivan Lexa, 
the state secretary in the Privatization Ministry, for his 
opinion, which he stated before the election of the president 
and which he reiterated after the presidential elections. 
Nobody else is being, or will be prosecuted on the territory of 
our state by the government. As far as administrative 
interference is concerned, there was not a single case of 
interference. While the polemics we pursue are unpleasant, we 
do not carry out any administrative interference, we do not 
issue orders or go in for red tape. 
  The arts have been developing freely. Those harboring 
another approach to the government and those who sometimes 
overdo things (are still finding the courage) to criticize the 
government. But that is a matter of taste and for us it is 
absolutely natural to respect this. Freedom of the press and 
the freedom of action by political entities is respected. There 
were no actions against other political entities. 
  In this connection, I would like to point out to the 
Hungarian political parties that they have signed the draft 
motion seeking a vote of no confidence in the government along 
with the very same people who only a few weeks ago called for a 
strong action in Komarno [where Hungarians called for autonomy] 
saying that there was a need to use force. If this does not 
serve as a reminder it does not matter. But do not regret it 
afterwards. 
  As regard to matters connected with the further development 
of our political system, at issue is not merely the purity of 
our society but a climate must inevitably be created, or rather 
the current climate must be changed in regard to the attitude 
parties take toward the state and the citizen. The fact that so 
many people have at present turned indifferently to politics, 
this my esteemed fellow deputies, represents a common failure of 
ours, both yours and mine, even if we come out of this best in 
this respect. Nonetheless, this is a failure. A citizen who is 
indifferent to public affairs poses the biggest threat to the 
state. You also have such people among your own voters. This 
is not merely our own disease. This poses a risk to the state 
and it cannot go on. To build on the collapse of our society's 
subconsciousness, the collapse of the interest in politics is 
not a policy for the future. This is a defeat for the state. 
Whoever builds on such a premise is himself a loser. Such a 
person will no longer be able to govern in any other way but 
with the help of the police. Up to now we did not need to do 
anything of this kind for we have been enjoying enough of the 
people's trust. 
  When making up your minds today, think well of what will 
happen after the elections. Do not create a state of affairs 
that would make cooperation difficult or even impossible after 
the elections have taken place. Those of you who are even a bit 
realistic know that we will win the elections. It does not 
matter when they take place. Do not draw a conclusion that 
would create a situation in which today's success paves way to a 
subsequent failure. I warn you and beg you to heed this advice. 
  Allow me now to express my own personal attitude. Along 
with my friends and colleagues--whether they are in the 
government or in our movement--I have achieved what no Slovak 
has succeeded in achieving in several decades or even centuries. 
I know none of the Slovak representatives who wanted to achieve 
a great deal who did not have an easy fate and did not end well. 
Nonetheless, to think that an office or who is in charge are 
not important, then when the interest of the nation and the 
state is at stake, one has to guarantee it also by one's own 
life and not merely by one's word and one's own position. This 
is the duty of the person who wants to be at the head of such a 
great movement. A person who is not prepared for this should 
not get involved. One cannot distribute rewards in this 
instance in the form of privatized projects. In such an 
instance foundations must be laid to prepare the whole of 
society for the 21st century. A person who does not have such 
great goals will achieve nothing great. A person who only sees 
personal interests will be rejected as a person. A person who 
does not have a program for the development as a whole will 
perish. Since many of you aspire to get involved and then look 
at what is ahead, I tell you that apart from the trapdoor of 
history, there is nothing beyond. One can either sink or swim. 
All of you who think that there is something beyond--there is 
nonetheless one great holy thing: To serve all and to give 
everything that is good as well as bad in us. [sentence as 
heard] 
  I am a normal person and I have made my own mistakes and 
have 
imperfections. I possess some advantages and some shortcomings. 
Everyone is better as well as worse at something. I have never 
resisted a factual criticism of what was not good and I have 
always endeavored to accept proposals that I have heard from 
you. If there were not many of them that could have been 
applied, do not blame me. 
  For the past four years I have been the subject of a 
continual political struggle. It was at one time [then 
Czechoslovak President] Havel who caused me a headache and now 
our own president is the instigator. During the past few weeks 
in this parliament you have been engaged in seeking our 
dismissal and now you will perhaps once again debate this matter 
and dismiss us. It is not pleasant to be a continual target of 
the most dirtiest and the most primitive attacks. It is not 
pleasant to be the subject of invectives and attacks as well as 
malicious remarks, some of which lack substance. You are against 
something that you feel instinctively but which you do not seem 
to be able to develop. It is not easy to live such a life and 
to bear such a burden. When I am doing it I am not doing it 
because I feel the need to be in power; I am not doing because I 
aspire to power; I am doing it because people have asked me to 
discharge such a service. I will go to them once more to ask 
them if they still want me. If they say "yes" to me I will 
continue to serve. 
  If you believe and stand on the idea of some kind of all 
embracing human understanding that all parties will be in the 
government and that calm will prevail everywhere, you will only 
succeed in bringing the discord that is among you in parliament 
into the government and into the state structures. You will 
thus destroy them. This is not such a simple mechanism that 
could be implemented in such a way. 
  If I fear a coalition that would be confrontational within 
itself then this is not because I want to hold onto the prime 
minister's chair. I am merely doing so because we do not want 
government departments and the state administration to start 
fighting among themselves. I do not want our society to become 
Balkanized. I do not want a misunderstanding among people, 
which has already been sown and which would lead to ethnic, 
social, or any other conflicts. When I was the prime minister 
nothing of this kind has happened. 
  Regarding matters concerning the understanding of what 
constitutes either a democratic or undemocratic management and 
discharge of state functions, you can have thousands of views on 
the matter, you can have thousands of standpoints, but results 
have nonetheless been achieved. Judge me for what I have done. 
Do not judge me for what you have, what I could have possibly 
done and what was not possible in a given situation. The 
situation as it existed in the government lead to us having one 
single common goal--the burning question of the aspiration of 
the state. [sentence as heard] With me in the government were 
people who joined at my invitation and each of whom had to win 
the trust of our people, and I beg you to treat these people 
with respect. They have done you no harm and they have given to 
you and to the state everything they were capable of giving. 
They have given their health, their own personal interests, 
their own families. They now have only their own life. They 
have given all. There are not many such politicians who have 
willingly given all. Whatever decision you make I am proud that 
I have been able to work with them. They are honorable people. 
If I were to form a future government the overwhelming majority 
of them would be included. 
  Regarding matters connected with present developments and 
attitudes, one can lose many battles. There is however, in 
history a time that I call the time of justice, a time that 
measures each of us. It contains within itself a great truth. 
In our life we all have been given an equal measure and time 
itself will judge us. Do not therefore do today anything that 
would damage the state. Do not be hasty in taking steps in 
which you would write the government off, only because its 
members do not come from your ranks. 
  I am so pleased and so proud that you are the parliament of 
the Slovak Republic as a state. You are its first parliament. 
I am just as pleased and proud of the fact that this was the 
first government of this state. If it is at all possible, let 
us make sure that (departments) of constitutional bodies are 
coordinated rather than clashing with one another. If it is at 
all possible, let us impart to people the art of carrying out a 
civilized dialogue, let us give peace to the country and let us 
respect its citizens. If possible, let us get united in 
political diversity where each of us will be able to help revive 
the socioeconomic system. [passage omitted] 
  If possible, let us look for a path leading to an agreement 
on the use of the huge potential that the Slovak Republic has. 
Wasting this opportunity we have would be irresponsible, 
because it might be thousands of years before another chance 
come's about. It might never come about. My interest has never 
been other than the interest of this state. You do not have to 
agree with me. In fact, it would not be a good idea if you did. 
I was tough in discussions. You know that I was a winner in the 
majority of discussion duels. But this should not give you 
grounds to say I was (nasty) to you. 
  As far as the issues of Slovakia's future are concerned, I 
will consider myself an optimist if the basic democratic 
substance of its existence--the free will of citizens--is 
manifested and maintained. Should this element be suppressed I 
would consider myself a really big pessimist. 
  I know this state inside out. I know each element in its 
mechanism, everything we fixed, failed to fix, or resolve. I 
know where it is heading, I know its potential. I believe in 
people. It is for them and in the face of them that you should 
demonstrate your belief. There is never just one solution, but 
a second, and subsequent solutions, especially on radical 
matters. Thank you. [applause]

  [Excerpt] At a news conference this afternoon, Vladimir 
Meciar expressed his views on the new government. In his view, 
it will not be a majority government, and if early parliamentary 
elections are not called by 1996, it will not last. 
  He was basing his argument on the new balance of power in 
parliament, where the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] 
will have 56 seats, the Slovak National Party nine seats, and 
the Hungarian coalition--whom, he said, no one wants in the 
coalition government--will have 14 seats. 
  Vladimir Meciar predicts that very soon there will be 
conflicts of interest among the rest of the parliamentary 
subjects. He did not exclude the posssibility that a new 
coalition, new relations inside the government, and new 
conflicts of interest would soon lead to a considerable 
differentiating process in these parties. He expects that the 
greatest changes will be in the Party of the Democratic Left, 
which, he said--I quote--is not pure and does not play a fair 
game. He also said--I quote--on 14 March 1939, a different 
government was formed here, and I am worried that this new 
government might be similar. 
  Vladimir Meciar said considerable changes will very soon 
take 
place in the HZDS, on the basis of which the movement, which 
until now focused its attention on fulfilling national 
democratic tasks, will start implementing socioeconomic tasks. 
  He stressed that in the interests of this state, the HZDS 
will try to make a political comeback. 
  In connection with the continuation of the 27th meeting of 
the Slovak Parliament, Meciar said that the HZDS will not 
support the constitutional bill reducing the term of the 
parliament and on calling early elections for 30 September and 1 
October. 
  The movement insists that a referendum be held and early 
elections immediately called. In the event of a HZDS victory in 
the early elections, Vladimir Meciar would be willing to be be 
sworn in as premier by the president only if the president 
immediately resigns. He thinks, however, that it is the duty of 
Michal Kovac to resign now. No other constitutional official 
has violated constitutional rights in such a vulgar manner as 
Kovac, Vladimir Meciar said. He added that Michal Kovac has 
violated the interests of state, and that he failed in both 
political and moral respects. Meciar and members of his cabinet 
are determined to speak about this everywhere they go. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Slovak President Michal Kovac by </F>
an unidentified correspondent on 12 March; place not 
given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] In the context of the current 
internal political situation following yesterday's vote of 
no-confidence in Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar in the Slovak 
parliament, Slovak Television asked Michal Kovac, the president 
of the Republic, for an exclusive interview. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, what is your view of the 
current political situation in Slovakia following the vote of 
no-confidence in Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar? 
  [Kovac] According to the information I have so far received 
from the president of our police corps, no gatherings of 
citizens expressing disapproval of the parliament's decision, 
with the exception of a gathering here in front of the 
Primacialny Palace, have been reported. However, we are 
speaking in late morning, and I do not know what will develop 
later in the day. 
  I think that the parliament's decision was free and 
democratic and that there was no pressure on the deputies. It 
was possible to say everything in defense of the critic [of 
Meciar, presumably speaking about himself], and the prime 
minister also had an opportunity to say what he considered 
necessary to say. Because we are in a democratic state, the 
decision made by the majority is the valid one. 
  I have to take the view that the parliament consists of 
deputies representing our citizens and thus, that the decision 
was made by the representatives of our citizens. This is a 
democratic decision that certainly does not mean any black mark 
against our parliament in the eyes of our public or the world. 
  I think that the parliament was facing a difficult decision 
also because, in substance, the matter was not just whether they 
express support for the government or no-confidence in the 
government because various speeches [in parliament] made it 
clear that the issue was also to decide in favor of a gradual 
implementation of an authoritarian system of power, or in favor 
of strengthening a parliamentarian system of power. I think 
that the parliament unequivocally decided to strengthen the 
parliamentary system of power, thus sending a very positive 
signal abroad where sometimes they have doubted whether we are 
really striving to strengthen democracy and the constitutional 
state of affairs in the Slovak Republic. 
  I also think that suitable conditions were created for us to 
take gradual steps to implement the idea of political, civic, 
and national reconciliation. Conditions are being created for 
us to prepare ourselves for elections in a peaceful and 
matter-of-fact atmosphere, to make it possible for our citizens 
to decide our future in an election as far as the composition of 
the parliament is concerned. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, can you say what steps you 
are 
undertaking or want to undertake to resolve the situation that 
has arisen? 
  [Kovac] I have to proceed in accordance with the 
Constitution, which means, first of all, that I must recall the 
government and, at the same time, I want to ask the Movement for 
a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] to try to form a coalition 
government headed by somebody else and not by Vladimir Meciar 
because a vote of no-confidence in him was passed. It may be 
possible to form only a government of a broader or a broad 
coalition. If the HZDS rejects this offer or does not succeed 
in forming such a coalition, I would turn to those political 
bodies that expressed in parliament no confidence in the present 
prime minister and ask them to nominate a person who could form 
a government. Of course, I will try to get the proposal for 
such a government as soon as possible. I personally think that 
it could all happen within 10 days, at the latest. Within this 
timetable, I will ask all of the ministers to continue 
exercising their present ministerial duties, and ask one of the 
deputy prime ministers to head the government temporarily until 
a new government is formed. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, are you then convinced that 
the further political development in Slovakia will be peaceful 
and above all democratic? 
  [Kovac] I am convinced about it and everybody, including 
representatives of the HZDS and the SNS [Slovak National Party], 
of the present opposition parties, and also the president and 
citizens, all of them want it. If we declare certain rules and 
steps leading to political, civic, and national reconciliation, 
it will then become apparent who does not want to play according 
to the rules, who says one thing and does another. We 
desperately need civic, political, and national reconciliation, 
and I am therefore, convinced that we will all contribute to 
making it all possible.

  [Text] The vote of no confidence in Slovak Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar has also decided whether authoritarian or 
parliamentary rule would prevail in Slovakia. This was stated 
today by Slovak President Michal Kovac in an exclusive interview 
for Slovak Television. He added that the National Council 
[parliament] made a clear-cut decision to continue strengthening 
the system of parliamentary power. Thus it has sent a very 
positive signal abroad, where doubts were sometimes cast as to 
whether we really try to strengthen democracy and constitutional 
rule, President Kovac said. At the same time, he emphasized 
that the parliament decided freely, democratically, and without 
pressure.

  [Excerpt] The Office of the President of the Slovak 
Republic informed the Press Agency of the Slovak Republic about 
further steps to be taken in connection with the results of 
today's session of the National Council [parliament] of the 
Slovak Republic. 
  As is known, the National Council passed a vote of 
no-confidence in Vladimir Meciar, the current prime minister. 
According to Article 116, Paragraph 6 of the Constitution, on 
the basis of this decision of the National Council, the 
president of the Republic is to recall the prime minister. The 
recall of the prime minister means the resignation of the whole 
government. The president of the Republic is determined to ask 
those members of the government who were not personally subject 
to a vote of no-confidence to temporarily continue exercising 
their duties at the utmost until the naming of the new 
government. The president of the Republic invited Tibor Cabaj, 
the chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
parliamentary group, to negotiate tomorrow morning with the 
strongest parliamentary group about the possibility of creating 
a new government. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with SDL Chairman Peter Weiss on 11 </F>
March; place not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] The Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], which is 
the second-largest party in the parliament, will have a lot of 
say in the process of forming a new government. This was the 
reason we put several questions to SDL Chairman Peter Weiss. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Weiss, only two weeks ago you feared 
most 
what would happen after D day (?in terms) of responsibility and 
the takeover of power. Has there been a change in the situation 
within the opposition over the past two weeks that would make 
you ready to take over the entire responsibility, not just the 
power, from the previous government? 
  [Weiss] I would like to point out that we held intensive 
talks with both the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] 
and other opposition parties. We were seeking ways out of the 
crisis. The offer I made to the prime minister today was voiced 
during our talks. A signal was sent to me that it was possible 
to hold talks with the HZDS. I would also like to pay a visit 
to the president. We could continue the intensive work carried 
out by the experts from opposition parties, who managed to agree 
on the basic priorities of the government, which will be an 
interim government. The main role of this government is to 
prepare early parliamentary elections. 
  [Correspondent] Am I to understand that now, shortly before 
1800 after the end of today's debate, the HZDS said it was ready 
to form a government with you without Former Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar? 
  [Weiss] I would not say so. There was a readiness to hold 
talks, and I think that is what is important. [passage omitted] 
  The president informed me that, as is customary, he would 
ask 
someone from the HZDS, which is the biggest group in the Slovak 
parliament, to try to form a government for this interim period. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Weiss, do you not fear that the 
parliamentary opposition needed the SDL to remove Vladimir 
Meciar's government and that, figuratively speaking, the SDL 
could be a ladder for the opposition achieving power? Or, in 
other words, are you not concerned that a right-wing coup could 
take place now? 
  [Weiss] That is not what I fear because the SDL would not be 
able to agree on this kind of (?policy-related) solution. Also, 
right from the beginning, we insisted on holding early 
elections. We rejected as absolutely unrealistic that this 
interim government could stay in power until the spring of 1995. 
We adopted an accommodating position regarding the opposition, 
regarding the date of the elections. At the moment, we are 
going for early elections. We have been promised that the bill 
on reducing the election period should go through the 
parliament. A new situation will arise if this bill does not go 
through. We will be forced to resort to other means, such as a 
referendum. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Do you have any guarantees that the new 
Cabinet will survive at least until early elections? 
  [Weiss] Those guarantees are to be found in broad 
cooperation, in a willingness to engage in a dialogue, and in 
outlining good priorities for the [new] Cabinet. 
  [Correspondent] Does this mean that those agreements will be 
confirmed in writing? Do you consider that form of confirmation 
a sort of coalition agreement on a broad basis? 
  [Weiss] I think it is always very good in politics to have 
agreements in writing. 
  [Correspondent] When are you going to see the president? 
  [Weiss] As soon as possible. 
  [Correspondent] That means when? 
  [Weiss] This evening. 
  [Correspondent] Who do you intend to include in the 
government of a broad coalition from among parliamentary parties? 
  [Weiss] I think it is not possible to exclude anybody in 
advance. However, I think that, during today's deliberations of 
the National Council of the Slovak Republic, some stances were 
voiced. We naturally count on the participation of opposition 
parties. 
  [Correspondent] Including Hungarian ones? 
  [Weiss] Talks with those parties have not concerned their 
participation in the Cabinet. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] When do you think early elections will take 
place? 
  [Weiss] I think they will take place at the beginning of 
October at the latest. Even if a referendum takes place, 
elections could not take place before September. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Following today's events, is the 
parliamentary opposition going to consider a change in the post 
of the chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic? 
  [Weiss] My view is that, so far, no reasons have emerged for 
us to leave the principle chosen after the elections, which is 
that the National Council bodies are to be elected on the basis 
of proportional representation. The HZDS continues to be the 
strongest political parliamentary group, and, if no 
extraordinary political circumstances emerge, I do not see any 
reason to abandon this principle.

  [Text] A group of about 300 supporters of the former prime 
minister [Vladimir Meciar], to whom the parliament gave a vote 
of no-confidence yesterday, has gathered in front of the Slovak 
president's residence in Bratislava this morning. The 
participants, who chanted slogans supporting Vladimir Meciar and 
calling on Michal Kovac to resign, gathered in Slovak National 
Uprising Square. Thinking that the president was holding talks 
with the opposition on the forming of a new government, they 
transferred to in front of the Primacialny Palace, which is 
Kovac's residence. 
  According to Jozef Sitko, director of the Presidential 
Office 
press department, the republican leadership of the Movement for 
a Demcratic Slovakia is holding a meeting in Spisska Nova Ves. 
According to previous statements, President Michal Kovac 
intended to ask the strongest group in the parliament, the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, to form a new cabinet. He 
is likely to hold talks with the representatives of 
parliamentary parties on Monday [14 March], when we can expect 
bigger rallies in support of Vladimir Meciar.

of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and Vladimir Meciar, 
who gathered in front of the parliament building, have 
physically assaulted Hungarian coalition deputies Vojtech Bugar, 
chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKHD], 
and Pal Csaky, chairman of the MKHD-Coexistance parliamentary 
group of deputies. Asked by a reporter from the Press Agency of 
the Slovak Republic why they did not ask for the protection of 
the policemen present, Vojtech Bugar said that the policeman 
whom he addressed said to him to gather 10,000 policemen and 
then he would oblige him. 
  Apart from slogans in support of Vladimir Meciar and the 
government, citizens who gathered in front of the parliament 
building chanted various appeals such as: Tomorrow we will take 
to the streets. 
  Approximately 300 people gathered in Primacialni Square in 
front of President Kovac's residence tonight, calling on him to 
resign.

  [Excerpt] In today's "Conversation from Lany" to be 
broadcast on the Czech radio at 1315 GMT, President Vaclav Havel 
returns to the vote of no confidence in [Slovak] Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar's government. 
  [Havel] It seems to be the culmination of a crisis that has 
lasted on the Slovak political scene for some time now. It is 
difficult to know how it will develop. However, it is probable 
that early elections will take place, and, until then, it is 
hoped that some kind of less conspicuous but efficient 
government will be formed rather soon, which I imagine will be a 
semicaretaker government, one that would bridge the period and 
contribute to calming down the situation. It is in the interest 
of both the Slovak citizens and all of us who are not 
indifferent to developments in Slovakia. [end recording]

  [Text] Warsaw, 14 Mar (PAP)--President Lech Walesa told PAP 
journalists Monday that he was surprised by the announcement of 
Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak's visit to Russia. "Such 
important visits must be consulted upon so that I am not taken 
by surprise," he added. 
  The president said the prime minister is "independent and 
self-governing, but it would be easier if we agreed on such 
matters. I discuss all of my foreign trips with the Mnistry of 
Foreign Affairs, and we need more cooperation here so that we 
can achieve more," the president said. 
  At the same time, Lech Walesa said that, according to 
information he has, Prime Minster Pawlak's visit "is among the 
issues that have been discussed. If new issues are raised and 
if the president is not consulted, the situation could be bad," 
he said.

  [Text] Banja Luka, March 11 (TANJUG)--Bosnian Moslem 
Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic has sought energetic action 
against Fikret Abdic, leader of the Moslem autonomous province 
of western Bosnia. 
  Addressing a session of the Moslem government in Sarajevo, 
Ljubijankic rejected the idea of granting cantonal status to 
western Bosnia, Bosnian Serb military sources say. 
  Cantonal organization modelled after the one in the Swiss 
confederation is envisaged in a Croat-Moslem deal on forming a 
federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina which would subsequently enter 
into a confederation with neighbouring Croatia. The deal was 
signed in Washington on March 1 under strong U.S. pressure. 
  Radical Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic, who has sent troops 
to western Bosnia to force it to abandon the idea of autonomy, 
accuses Abdic of breaking up Bosnia. 
  Ljubijankic urged Bosnian Croat officials to suspend all aid 
to Abdic and cut off land routes to western Bosnia, arguing that 
this would help win over Abdic's followers for the government in 
Sarajevo. 
  Abdic, who believes that the Bosnian crisis should be 
resolved in talks with the local Serbs and Croats, has 
repeatedly accused Izetbegovic of continuing the war in an 
attempt to create an Islamic state and of sacrificing his own 
people to achieve this goal.

<F P=106> [Article in two installments by Iulia Rosca and Cristian </F>
Anghelache on the opinions of members of parliament on the 6 
March government reshuffle: "The Government Reshuffle--A 
Weekend Surprise"] 
<H5>  [8 Mar p 3] </H5>
  [Text] We immediately wanted to know what members of 
parliament think about the government reshuffle, which they 
learned about from the press, and about how it was carried out. 
The answers given seem to show that the members of parliament 
chosen have not yet recovered from their surprise: 
  Lucian Avramescu, vice president of the Socialist Democracy 
Party of Romania [PDSR]: "It was expected, although it was not 
known who would be changed. If we are discussing the people in 
question, I cannot say what my opinion is. I do not know them. 
It was natural to change Paul Teodoru [former transportation 
minister], after all that had happened; it was an obligation. 
As for Niculae Spiroiu [former defense minister], they were too 
hasty. True, it seemed necessary to replace the leadership of 
the Ministries of the Interior and Defense with civilians. 
Returning to Spiroiu, taking into consideration the accusations 
brought against him by Vadim Tudor [Greater Romania Party 
leader], they should have waited and not given the latter such 
satisfaction. It is positive that the interior minister has 
been changed, because I had the impression that a Greater 
Romania swarm had formed in that ministry." 
  Gheorghe Raducanu, deputy of minorities and quaestor of the 
Chamber of Deputies: "This was the second reshuffle, and I view 
it as opportune. In any case, Mr. Petre Ninosu [former justice 
minister] was not changed because of any professional 
incompetence. I do not know whether Mr. Spiroiu was necessarily 
changed because of the founded or unfounded accusations 
regarding the structure in the leadership of the Ministries of 
the Interior and Defense. The replacement of the minister of 
transportation may be due to failings in his work." 
  Ion Ratiu, deputy, vice president of the National Peasant 
Christian Democratic Party and of the Chamber of Deputies: "What 
reshuffle?! Things are standing still; there is no real or 
comprehensive change. I am convinced that Mr. Spiroiu's change 
is not based on the accusations brought against him. I am 
surprised that he has been changed. This could have been done 
later. The excuse is that NATO demands that a civilian control 
the Armed Forces in all democracies. It seems to me that this 
is merely a justification, an excuse. In my opinion, Mr. 
Spiroiu had an equidistant and democratic attitude; he made 
important changes to remove some personnel. It seems that this 
attitude of his was fatal. I think that the changes in the 
Ministries of Justice and the Interior confirm the desire of the 
current executive authority to maintain complete control in the 
hands of the majority party--the PDSR." 
  Mihai Viziru, deputy of the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM]: 
"I learned about the government reshuffle last night on 
television and today from the press. I understood that it was a 
problem of the ruling party and that Mr. Nicolae Vacaroiu was 
completing his team with professional people. We do not have 
any merit in this change, except that we told the government to 
take a stand on the so-called Tigareta affair [cigarette 
smuggling affair in which the army was allegedly involved]. The 
minister of defense was--or seemed to be--involved in it; his 
change, however, is not the consequence of these accusations. 
Mr. Ninosu was replaced because of his parliamentary group. Mr. 
Novac is the minister of transportation because he has worked in 
this area and has been present during all the labor actions in 
this ministry." 
  Varujan Vosganian, president of the parliamentary group of 
minorities: "This reshuffle once again demonstrates that the 
entire political game of late has not been based on any serious 
intention to change the political aspect of the government 
apparatus. It is a show of force, if not of defiance of the 
other parliamentary parties by the PDSR. What remains to be 
seen is whether the parties within the leftist coalition will 
put up with being defied. Insofar as the opposition, especially 
the Democratic Convention, is concerned, the same problem 
arises. Developments in parliamentary political activity show 
that, from an ideological point of view, a conciliation with the 
ruling party is ruled out. We are not talking of an ideological 
conflict of yesterday, today, or four years ago, but of a 
conflict dating back 50 years; it has been brought back into the 
political arena of today. The differences are too great between 
the partners in the `negotiations' to permit a viable coalition. 
While in the Elisabeta Palace, handshakes were exchanged or 
nonaggression pacts were concluded, the political struggle was 
being waged more fiercely than ever. Thus, any understanding 
between the two parliamentary camps becomes a naivete." 
  Alexandru Nicolae, deputy of the Democratic Party (National 
Salvation Front) [PD-FSN]: "This is a custom of the government. 
It is not the first time that it has reshuffled the cabinet. 
To me, however, it seems unconstitutional. This reshuffle is a 
tremendous gaffe made by those in power by replacing Minister 
Spiroiu at a time of conflict launched by Vadim Tudor, this 
mini-Zhirinovskiy of Romania, who has created so many problems 
not only for Spiroiu as a man, but especially for the Ministry 
of National Defense, both at home and abroad. This Vadim Tudor 
has succeeded in creating a harmful atmosphere in the arms 
industry. As for the other ministries, I am of the opinion that 
if something has to be changed, it has to be in the economics 
ministries in order to invigorate industry and to speed up the 
reform and transition process." 
  Vasile Popovici, deputy for the Civic Alliance Party [PAC]: 
"It seems to me normal that three of the four ministers have 
been changed: Ninosu, Danescu [former interior minister], and 
Teodoru. What seems, however, intolerable is to change the 
general in the context of a dispute between a political crook 
and the Army general. Given that this dispute has not been 
clarified, the message to the population is that the army is 
being accused. In this situation, it is urgently necessary to 
unblock the `Vadim Tudor files,' which are to be discussed by 
the bodies of justice. It is a very serious thing that in the 
Vadim Tudor-Spiroiu dispute, the Army was defeated and 
subjugated to a Securitate man, while the current minister 
[Gheorghe Tinca] is a former collaborator of that Securitate 
viper's nest SAPTAMANA, a former version of the weekly ROMANIA 
MARE." 
  Dan Cristian Popovici, deputy and president of the 
parliamentary group of the Greater Romania Party [PRM]: "This 
reshuffling is a constitutional right which the president of 
Romania has exercised. I personally think that the legal 
implications were clarified last time. We will probably witness 
other such government reshuffles brought about primarily by 
mental exhaustion caused by the very tiring activity of 
ministers. Normally, a man who has already become used to the 
vicissitudes in the life of a minister does not rapidly realize 
what solutions are needed to unblock the mechanism, while a new 
member who joins the team may do so." 
  Ion Dobrescu, deputy of the Liberal Party '93 [PL '93]: 
"What reshuffle, my dear fellow?! This is not what I call a 
government reshuffle. Four notorious ministers have been 
replaced by another four ministers, who may be even more 
notorious, or not at all. In any case, the reshuffle was to be 
expected and this hoax may work with some people, but not with 
ourselves. The Defense Ministry has been infiltrated by 
Securitate people." 
  Dumitru Buzatu, PDSR deputy: "I think that this reshuffle 
has surprised a large proportion of the members of parliament, 
because it took place unexpectedly. Essentially, it follows 
certain demands made some time ago, namely to have civilians at 
the helm of the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of 
the Interior. I personally do not know the people who have been 
appointed, except for the Senate vice president, and so I cannot 
express my opinion about their competence." 
  Nicolae Octavian Daramus, deputy of the Romanian National 
Unity Party [PUNR]: "This government reshuffle has come at the 
right time. The government's work was somehow being blocked 
from both sides of the political arena. The ruling party wanted 
to unblock it; it is a temporary thing and in the not too 
distant future a new government formula will be tried." 
  Gyula Vida, deputy, president of the UDMR [Democratic Union 
of Hungarians in Romania] parliamentary group: "I expressed my 
opinion in connection with this issue on 17 December 1993 when 
the discussion on the censure motion took place. I think that 
the current government is not capable of taking action; it does 
not have the necessary support and political performance; and it 
does not enjoy international credibility in managing 
socioeconomic policy, which is deteriorating with every passing 
day. I think that the essence of the problem will not be changed 
through this reshuffle. It is just a cosmetic operation, an 
attempt to calm down the public, but the government is actually 
the same. In connection with the replacement of Lieutenant 
General Spiroiu, I think it was not a measure that suited the 
current political situation in our country." 
  Doru Viorel Ursu, PD(FSN) deputy: "Apparently, one can talk 
of a government reshuffle by interpreting--in a very broad 
sense--the constitutional dispositions, which, in turn, seem to 
speak about a parliamentary republic. What do I think about 
this simple replacement of people? From a political point of 
view, President Iliescu has increasingly been assuming the role 
of a single factor of power. Thus, we are not talking of a 
change in concept or in the attitude of a government that has 
not been functioning for a long time, but about painting one's 
image. This way no one will notice that there is no more 
interest in whether Bessarabia is slipping away toward the east 
and that there are strikes and other problems. Neither strikes 
nor reshuffles add anything new. We can also talk about the 
inappropriate time when it happened, and that it was somewhat 
hasty and covert. I do not want to hurt anyone, I have no 
argument with these people, but insofar as the Ministry of 
National Defense is concerned, the change does raise a question 
mark." 
  "This change revealed the image of the defense minister the 
moment the press noted that the offensive to sort out the 
`affairs' in the ministry was under way. As far as Teodoru is 
concerned, things are much simpler. Obviously, both Mr. Iliescu 
and the ruling party did not take an absolutely necessary 
measure when it was imperative, namely when the Petromin-Forum 
Maritime contract [on the sale of Romanian fleet] was 
sanctioned. To avoid the discovery of this serious mistake, 
which would have entailed not only the dismissal of the minister 
of transportation, but also that of the entire government, they 
used this reshuffle." 
  Dinu Patriciu, deputy of the Liberal Party '93 [PL '93]: 
"Instead of a parliamentary majority that supports a genuinely 
reformist government, a minimal solution was preferred, namely a 
change of ministers; again without respecting the Constitution, 
that is without passing them through parliament. This proves 
that the attitude of the PL '93 was justified and we hope that 
our partners in the opposition have also understood that the 
discussions with the PDSR are not serious, because all they try 
to do is to delay and drag things out without any serious 
results." 
  Sergiu Cunescu, PDSR deputy: "I appreciate that the 
executive authority was convinced of the need to appoint 
civilians to the Ministries of the Interior and Defense. 
However, we regret that General Spiroiu, for whom we harbor 
feelings of respect, has been replaces as head of the Army." 
  Corneliu Coposu, PNTCD [National Peasant Christian 
Democratic 
Party] senator: "The recent government reshuffle means nothing 
more than a continuation of the crypto-communist policy of 
rotating cadres," said PNTCD President Mr. Corneliu Coposu at a 
weekly news conference held yesterday, 7 March. The replacement 
of General Spiroiu at the head of the Ministry of National 
Defense, under the pretext of observing the recommendations made 
by the Council of Europe, has been assessed as a "serious 
political mistake." Apart from the risk that the appointment of 
a civilian to this position may not be well received by the 
Army, the context within which it was made is regrettable. In 
Mr. Coposu's opinion, additional proof is the fact that 
"President Iliescu is under the influence of evil forces and is 
susceptible to blackmail," because General Spiroiu's replacement 
is tantamount to playing Corneliu Vadim Tudor's game. The 
reshuffle means nothing more, the PNTCD leader believes, than 
prolonging the government's agony for another two to three 
months with the final aim of preparing early elections. "We do 
not view this reshuffle as beneficial and we do not believe that 
it has contributed to Romania's stability or credibility abroad. 
Early elections cannot be avoided, but only delayed," Mr. 
Corneliu Coposu concluded. 
  Ion Diaconescu, PNTCD deputy: "Nothing has changed in the 
balance of power; there is no obvious modification in the 
political arena. I was surprised by President Iliescu's words 
justifying the reshuffle through economic objectives, while all 
the ministers who were changed were responsible for sectors 
other than economic ones; thus I do not see how they could 
improve the political crisis. Minister Spiroiu's change is very 
interesting. This move can be interpreted as an achievement by 
Vadim Tudor, because no measures were taken against him, but 
against General Spiroiu. Justifying this measure with the 
demands of the Memorandum is not significant. The Council of 
Europe recommended a civilian minister of defense, but we were 
not obliged to take this measure. There is a tradition in 
Romania in this respect: In the past 150 years, all defense 
ministers were career military men." 
<H5>  [9 Mar p 3] </H5>
  [Text] Petre Roman, deputy and president of the Democratic 
Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)]: ``No one contests 
the right of a government to try to improve its work by 
reshuffling the cabinet; however, the answers to the questions 
why, how, and when in connection with the current government 
reshuffle are disappointing. First, because no reasons were 
given. It would have been normal, for instance, to learn why 
those who held the respective positions were dismissed and what 
is expected from those who have been appointed instead. As a 
result of the way in which this reshuffle occurred--by once 
again ignoring parliament--a third of the current government is 
made up of people who have not been confirmed by parliament. 
This government reshuffle seems inappropriate because 
undoubtedly it raises questions such as how this fits in with 
the open dialogue with all the opposition political forces in 
order to conclude a national political pact and what it means 
for the capital of trust with which we proceeded to achieve a 
consensus to come out of this blockage. The surprise was very 
great when on Friday, 4 March, that is 48 hours before 
announcing the reshuffle, the country's president affirmed that 
there was no intention to reshuffle the government. 
  ``We believe that, whenever a government reshuffle entails 
changes in sensitive positions, which, to a great extent, regard 
general national interests, such as defense, justice, and the 
interior, consultations are needed to avoid useless tension and 
keep the option for national consensus open. Unfortunately, 
such consultations did not take place this time around either.'' 
  Victor Babiuc, deputy and vice president of the PD(FSN): 
``The current government reshuffle suffers from the same faults 
as the former one, faults which were not meant to be noticed. 
Thus, they were eschewed both by the government and the other 
authorities, which were supposed to make sure that the reshuffle 
was carried out by abiding by the Constitution. When I say 
this, I am referring to the fact that, in accordance with 
Romania's Constitution, the appointment of government members 
has to be ratified by parliament, contrary to what happens in 
Western countries where parliament approves solely the prime 
minister and the government's program. Our Constitution also 
stipulates that the cabinet has to be voted on. 
  ``f there is no specific text available in this respect, a 
move like this can be modified by observing the initial 
procedure. I am talking of the so-called `principle of the 
asymmetry of legal actions.' And this is not all. We cannot 
have two kinds of ministers: some endorsed by parliament, 
others not. Nothing can justify the conclusion that this is 
something normal. In our Constitution, there is a very 
important text, which has been overlooked, namely the one 
regarding `interim' status. This part of the Constitution 
stipulates that a person who is already a minister may be 
appointed as an interim minister. This means that that person 
starts from the status of a mandate previously ratified by 
parliament. Within 45 days, the maximum duration of such an 
interim status, it is necessary to have the appointment approved 
by parliament. This holds all the more true when we talk about 
appointments for a longer period, probably until the end of the 
parliamentary term; the person in question has to be recognized 
by the parliament of the time. And this requires discussions 
within the permanent commissions and then within the plenary 
session of the two parliamentary chambers.'' 
  Stefan Radoff, senator of the Civic Alliance Party [PAC]: 
"Much fuss is being made about political and social pacts. The 
first step that should have demonstrated an opening toward them 
would have been the proposal by our country's president that 
these ministers be heard and not appointed by presidential 
decree. Taking each of these figures separately, I think that 
there are two matters at stake: The recommendations made by the 
Council of Europe with regard to the appointment of civilians to 
replace the military at the helm of strategic institutions were 
not mandatory, specifically now with this Balkan conflict. Mr. 
Spiroiu's replacement by a man who has nothing to do with the 
Army or its policy, as I have nothing to do with things outside 
my profession, is not welcome. Mr. Taracila's appointment as 
Minister of the Interior--bearing in mind his performance in the 
Senate, his honesty, and the competence that he has proved, is 
beneficial. As for the transportation department, which is the 
most vulnerable because this minister is firmly suspected of 
being corrupt, Mr. Teodoru's replacement is welcome as is that 
of Mr. Ninosu, which was necessary from a political point of 
view because of the delays in restructuring the justice system." 
  Valer Suian, PUNR senator: "This was a political event, 
which had been expected for a long time. It is a positive thing 
that it took place at this time, but it would have been even 
better had it taken place earlier. The various political games 
between the majority party and the opposition, including the 
PUNR, made this expected and necessary reshuffle a little late. 
I think that through the importance of the portfolios affected 
by this reshuffle, this change may have important consequences 
for the progress of the reform process, at least in certain 
respects, something that means decisive steps in the direction 
of institutional democratization in Romania, and it is also in 
keeping with the recommendations made by European bodies." 
  Ion Aurel Stoica, PD(FSN) senator: "The time of the 
government reshuffle was uninspired considering the stage of 
discussions between the parliamentary opposition parties and the 
party holding a relative majority in parliament. You do not 
need to be an analyst to ask whether a reshuffle at this time 
does not jeopardize and question the honesty of this dialogue 
and its outcome. Second, I cannot help noting the short circuit 
in parliament; we are of the opinion that the ministers or the 
candidates for the position of minister have to be heard by the 
parliamentary commissions and approved by parliament before the 
reshuffle takes place."

  [Text] One of the participants in the conference--which has 
been prepared under the auspices of the State Chamber by both 
Slovene universities --was Dr. Willem van Eekelen, secretary 
general of the West European Union [WEU]. In his speech 
yesterday he warned that civilian supervision over military 
decisions is one of the fundamental principles in providing 
security in democratic states. 
  In a brief interview to our reporter Tomaz Gerden, Mr. van 
Eekelen also assessed Slovenia's prospects in the European 
integrations: 
  [Begin recording] [Gerden] We asked Dr. van Eekelen about 
Slovenia's prospects for cooperation and integration into the 
Partnership for Peace, the WEU, and NATO: 
  [Eekelen, in English with superimposed Slovene translation] 
I think that it is important for Slovenia to make progress in 
all different directions. First in the Council of Europe, whose 
member you already are, and then in NATO's Partnership for 
Peace, which will be important for the cooperation of your army 
with the Western armies. In this way your armed forces will 
adopt Western standards in military budget, arms, organization, 
and civilian supervision over military policy. However, I do 
not believe that you or others will shortly become NATO members. 
There will be quite some time needed for this. 
  [Gerden] Dr. van Eekelen also added that cooperation with 
the European Union [EU] is of extreme importance for Slovenia, 
as it means stability for our state in various aspects. As soon 
as Slovenia signs the association agreement with the EU it will 
also be admitted into the WEU Consultative Council, and this 
cooperation will widen further later. 
  Dr. van Eekelen also stressed that the WEU in no way views 
Slovenia within the framework of the former Yugoslavia but 
treats it as an independent European country. [end recording]

  [Text] Karolos Papoulias, foreign minister of Greece and 
chairman of the Ministerial Council of the European Union, today 
arrived in Belgrade. He was met at the Belgrade airport by 
Zeljko Simic, deputy federal prime minister. In a statement for 
journalists, Papoulias did not announce new ideas for peace, but 
stressed that the European Union will remain, as he said, 
dynamically present in the continuation of the negotiations on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Jelena Vidic reports: 
  [Vidic] Journalists meeting the Greek foreign minister at 
the Belgrade airport asked him whether the European Union was 
disturbed by the monopolization of the problem of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina by the United States and Russia. Papoulias 
answered the following: 
  [Begin Papoulias recording in Greek with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] A political factor such as Europe 
is not disturbed. In any case, we want to maintain our presence 
together with other powerful factors such as the United States 
and Russia. However, no one should forget the European Union's 
contribution so far, nor the ideas in the program of activities 
of the European Union. These ideas are today still the most 
important ideas. [end recording] 
  [Vidic] Papoulias said that Bosnia-Herzegovina will be 
discussed at the informal meeting of the European Union's 
ministers at the end of this month. He said that the possible 
dispatch of Turkish soldiers to Bosnia is currently of interest 
for all Balkan countries, because they had agreed not to deploy 
their troops on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. 
However, if the Turkish troops are deployed in Bosnia, Greece 
will consider the possibility of doing the same, Papoulias said. 
  Here is now what Zeljko Simic, deputy federal prime 
minister, 
said about expectations from talks with the Greek foreign 
minister today. 
  [Begin Simic recording] From today's talks we expect the 
speeding up of the process of settling the crisis in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina and the Balkans in general. In this sense we will 
hold talks with Mr. Papoulias with pleasure. We are very 
familiar with the stand of Greece, which is investing enormous 
efforts toward the peaceful settlement of the crisis, and toward 
the settlement by political means of all problems affecting the 
Balkan Peninsula. [end recording]

  [Text] At today's meeting in Bratislava, the Slovak 
Government has unanimously decided to end its activity. 
According to another decision, no member of Vladimir Meciar's 
government will accept the president's request to exercise his 
duties until the formation of a new cabinet. 
  The government has also agreed to recall all state 
secretaries [deputy ministers] and all heads of ministerial 
offices by 18 March. Meciar announced that he received two 
letters from the president. In one of the letters, the 
president notified him of his dismissal from the office of the 
prime minister and in the second one, he was asked as the 
chairman of the strongest political party to nominate a 
representative of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] 
who would attempt to form a new government. Meciar emphasized 
that the HZDS was not going to enter into any government and was 
going into opposition.

  [Text] Croatian President Dr. Franjo Tudjman has received 
Vitaliy Churkin, Russian deputy foreign minister and President 
Yeltsin's special envoy, in the presidential palace in Zagreb. 
  They discussed the resolution of the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and throughout the region following the 
preliminary agreement signed by the Bosniak Muslim and Croatian 
sides in Washington, a statement by the office of the president 
says. 
  Mr. Churkin expressed satisfaction with the positive climate 
created after the signing of the preliminary Washington 
agreement, which is providing an impetus for a lasting solution 
to the problems and crisis throughout the region. He stressed 
that Russia welcomes the role of the United States in this 
process and emphasized that closer contacts between Russia, the 
United States, and the EU had been achieved. He again stressed 
that Russia supports the resolution of the problem of the 
protected areas in the context of an integral, sovereign, and 
internationally recognized Republic of Croatia. He was 
interested in Croatia's viewpoints and the progress of the 
Vienna negotiations. 
  President Tudjman explained Croatia's standpoints on the 
resolution of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and on the 
resolution of the problem of the protected areas. He expressed 
satisfaction at the progress in the work of the transitional 
committee for the preparation of federal and confederal 
documents in Vienna and also at Russia's readiness to make a 
constructive contribution to the overall resolution of the 
crisis. 
  Also taking part in the talks were Defense Minister Gojko 
Susak; Dr. Branimir Jaksic, deputy head of the president's 
office; Leonid Kerestedzhiyants, Russia's ambassador in Croatia;

  [Text] [Announcer] We have Mr. Mate Granic, the Croatian 
foreign minister and vice prime minister, on the line. Good 
evening, Mr. Granic. You landed in Zagreb a few minutes ago, if 
I am not wrong. 
  [Granic] That's right. I'm still in the car. 
  [Announcer] We have managed to get hold of you as soon as 
you 
arrived in Zagreb. Would you please comment on these 10 days, 
especially today, when we impatiently waited for a long time for 
the agreement to be reached. 
  [Granic] As you can see, after persistent and serious 
negotiations which lasted for 10 days, the draft constitution of 
the federation has finally been completed. We also agreed on 
all basic principles of the confederation, but the final form 
and content will be agreed only after the negotiations with the 
Serb side, and when the final set-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
determined. 
  In addition, we discussed interim measures and the interim 
functioning of authorities. We also discussed the maps, 
borders, certain basic principles, but no final agreement has 
been reached on this issue. But that was not our aim. A much 
more important goal was finally to draw up a constitution of the 
federation. As you know, that had to be done by 15 March, and 
we completed it today. 
  [Announcer] We have learned from various sources that the 
problem in the Muslim delegation this afternoon and this evening 
was the authority of the president of the federation and the 
prime minister of the federal government. Can you tell us, if 
that is not a diplomatic secret, how that problem has been 
solved? 
  [Granic] It has been solved well. There have been 
consultations; we also had consultations with Zagreb, with 
President Tudjman. However, the consultations between Vienna 
and Sarajevo were somewhat longer, and finally at around 1900 or 
2000 that problem was also solved. As far as the Croatian side 
is concerned, the problem was solved in a very satisfactory way. 
  [Announcer] Does that mean that the president has greater 
authority? 
  [Granic] It is more or less so. But, the president and vice 
president rotate every year and are elected for a four-year 
period, and one year it is a Bosniak and the next a Croat. 
  [Announcer] You have probably also decided whether the 
first president will be a Muslim or a Croat, and who will be the 
first prime minister. 
  [Granic] The constitution does not specify that. It is a 
matter of political agreement. 
  [Announcer] Such an agreement was or was not reached over 
the 
past ten days? 
  [Granic] No, we did not even discuss that. 
  [Announcer] You said that the most interesting point now is 
that both Croat and Muslim representatives, as well as Redman, 
are stressing that a joint platform for talks with the Serbs has 
been agreed on. Can we hear at least the basic principles of 
that platform? 
  [Granic] It was agreed that after the agreement is signed, 
which is to happen at the end of next week in Washington 
[changes thought], it means that President Tudjman will go to 
Washington at the end of the week and sign the agreement in the 
White House. The negotiations with the third side will then 
begin. We agreed on proposals for the constitutional set-up and 
on certain basic principles of territorial division--not all of 
it, but we still have enough time to agree on it completely. 
  [Announcer] I must insist, was it agreed how much 
territory--what percentage--will be demanded from the Bosnian 
Serbs, seeing that they have said that they cannot give more 
than 15 percent. 
  [Granic] That was also discussed and certain proposals for 
the maps have been put forward, but that is an issue of the 
strategy of negotiations. The information about 15 percent is 
not true. They are now ready to give about 20 percent. 
  [Announcer] There is something that you have probably not 
heard yet. I will try to tell you what it is about because we 
have already shown this report to our viewers. Today Momcilo 
Krajisnik made a statement following his meeting with Vitaliy 
Churkin, saying that the Bosnian Serbs had been offered 
something which is, to say the least, very interesting. The 
offer is for them to enter into a confederal relationship with 
the Muslim-Croat federation, and to enter into a confederal 
relationship with the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
Will that be possible, and how do you comment on that 
possibility? 
  [Granic] That is absolutely impossible. Mr. Churkin had such 
ideas, but that was energetically refuted when we had talks in 
Moscow. Also, under no circumstances will Croatia enter any 
kind of relationship linking it directly or indirectly with 
Yugoslavia. That was very firmly stated to Mr. Churkin, Kozyrev, 
and also to the Bosniak side. 
  [Announcer] What is the position of the Bosniak side on such 
a relationship? 
  [Granic] As far as the main negotiator, Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic, is concerned, he agrees with our stands. 
  [Announcer] When you say the main negotiator, are you 
hinting in a way at certain disagreements among the Muslim 
leadership? 
  [Granic] I cannot say that. As far as that stand is 
concerned, I cannot say that there are any disagreements in the 
Muslim side. We talked a lot about it today. Croatia is not 
ready to enter any direct or indirect relationship with 
Yugoslavia or Serbia, and everyone knows this. 
  [Announcer] I would like to ask you something in the end. It 
seems that the presence--at America's invitation--of the 
delegation of the Bosnian Posavina area at the negotiations in 
Vienna passed unnoticed. What was their role, and does it 
indicate that the demands the Muslim-Croat federation will make 
to the Bosnian Serbs will be strongest in that area, in Bosnian 
Posavina? 
  [Granic] Everyone knows who the negotiators are: Mr Kresimir 
Zubak on behalf of the Bosnian Croats, and Messrs Martinovic and 
Akmadzic were also present. The Croatian delegation is also 
known. As far as the presence of Messrs Pandzic, Kovacevic and 
Markesic is concerned, they were in the embassy and mainly 
expressed firm support for everything that went on, that is, the 
Washington agreement and everything else. I believe that this 
was their role. 
  [Announcer] And the final question is about Krajina. Momcilo 
Krajisnik said in the same statement that the Bosnian Serbs 
would insist on linking the so-called Serb Republic with the 
so-called Krajina. Can you comment on that? Was there any talk 
over the past ten days about the guarantees the U.S. gave to 
Croatia for the peaceful reintegration of the occupied areas? 
  [Granic] The guarantees are being discussed all the 
time--both with the United States, the Security Council, the UN 
secretary-general, and the European Union. No link at all can 
be considered. That is the sovereign territory of the Republic 
of Croatia, and Croatia is ready to negotiate in the framework 
of Security Council resolutions, the Constitution and the 
constitutional law. 
  [Announcer] Thank you very much, Mr Granic. Good night.

  [Editorial Report] Zagreb GLOBUS in Serbo-Croatian on 10 
March on pages 5 and 6 carries a report on the results of an

  [Text] The Headquarters of the Serbian Army of Krajina has 
announced that in the past 24 hours, the Croatian Army on 
several occasions has hit Krajina positions and civilian targets 
in Lika, shooting from (?Trle), from where it still has not 
withdrawn. These attacks from infantry and artillery weapons 
were responded to by shooting at the Croatian Army combat 
positions and, it is said in the announcement, great losses have 
been inflicted upon them. 
  When visiting that section of the Lika battlefield, Milan 
Martic, president of the Republic of Serbian Krajina, and Major 
General Milan Celeketic, commander of the Serbian Army of 
Krajina, expressed satisfaction with the development of events. 
After visiting the Kozjan region, Martic and Celeketic met the 
local leadership of Teslingrad, the Lika town that was most 
frequently attacked from Croatian soldiers' positions in this 
war and to which huge material damage has been caused. 
  The Krajina Army General Staff reported that provocations by 
the Croatian Army have also been registered in the Plasko region 
in Lika, Zemunik Gornji, Smiljcic near Benkovac, and Novigrad, 
as well as Kricke and other towns near Drnis and Velika Glava 
near Skradin.

<F P=106> [Report by Radmila Popova: "Ilinden United Macedonian </F>
Organization Demanded Political Autonomy for Pirin Macedonia"] 
  [Text] At a news conference held on 9 March, Yordan 
Ivanov, chairman of the unregistered Ilinden United Macedonian 
Organization [Ilinden OMO], declared that the claim that the 
Macedonians are Bulgarians is war propaganda. He accused the 
government of racial discrimination, genocide, and apartheid, 
adding that the Bulgarian media had been trying to incite acts 
of violence against the Macedonian population in Pirin Macedonia 
[part of Bulgaria]. The program of the Ilinden OMO that has 
been announced demands a status of political, cultural, and 
economic autonomy for Pirin Macedonia. The program envisages 
the introduction of the Macedonian language into school 
curriculums and local administration, an independent Macedonian 
church, a ban on foreign propaganda regarding assimilation and 
economic independence, and the withdrawal of the Bulgarian 
occupation troops. According to Ivanov, the Ilinden OMO, on 
whose membership composition he declined to comment, is financed 
independently from membership dues, but that it was considering 
appealing to the government and the mass media for aid in the 
future. At the same time, it was stated that the Ilinden OMO, 
although not legally registered at the court, will sue the media 
for their insults and offenses against the organization.

must be committed to the problems of the Bulgarians living in 
the Western outlands, Zhan Videnov said after today's meeting of 
the leadership of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] with a 
delegation of the Democratic Union of the Bulgarians in 
Yugoslavia. 
  The information regarding the banning of the Democratic 
Union 
of Bulgarians in Yugoslavia is unofficial, but if it is 
confirmed the BSP will react sharply, Zhan Videnov said.

<F P=106> ["N.O."-signed report: "Kuncze: The Issue of the </F>
Imprisoned Hungarians Has To Be Resolved -- Agreement Between 
the SZDSZ and the RMDSZ"] 
  [Text] It can be a test of the Romanian side's credibility 
if they indeed find a solution to the issue of the ethnic 
Hungarian Romanian citizens who were imprisoned in the wake of 
the 1989 events. This was stated by Gabor Kuncze, faction 
leader and prime minister candidate of the Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ], at a news conference on 10 March where he 
reported on the three-member party delegation's visit to Romania 
which had ended on 9 March. 
  At the talks with the SZDSZ's delegation, general secretary 
of the Bucharest government Viorel Hrebenciuc, who is considered 
to be President Iliescu's most influential adviser, held out the 
possibility of reassessing the clemency applications of the 
condemned people. A promise was also made about opening two 
more border crossing points in 1994, and Senate chairman Oliviu 
Gherman admitted that it was advisable to expedite the 
ratification of the already signed bilateral agreements on 
investment protection and the avoidance of dual taxation. The 
SZDSZ delegation explained to its hosts that a general 
improvement in bilateral relations could be achieved together 
with settling the national minority issue. In reply to MAGYAR 
HIRLAP's question, Kuncze said that according to the original 
program, they should have met Prime Minister Vacaroiu but the 
Romanian side canceled the meeting due to the government 
reshuffle in Bucharest. During the talks with the leaders of 
the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [RMDSZ -- UDMR in 
Romanian] and the mayors of Harghita and Covasna counties, the 
Free Democrats said that, if their party becomes a governmental 
factor, they would continue to keep the issue of the Hungarians 
in Romania on the agenda in an institutionalized form and in 
terms of standards, but they would certainly not wish to 
influence the RMDSZ's political line. Kuncze also said that the 
mayor of Marcelhaza [Marcelova] had to cancel Kuncze's planned 
visit on 15 March because of the conflicts between the Hungarian 
organizations in Slovakia. 
  Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, parliamentary deputy of the SZDSZ who 
was also part of the delegation, said to MAGYAR HIRLAP that all 
the RMDSZ leaders agree with the concept according to which the 
Free Democrats handle the system of relations with Romania. He 
added that the classical legal theory of liberalism was indeed 
solely based on individual rights. However, the modern liberal 
view has reached the point of recognizing that certain rights 
can only be guaranteed if they are linked to some community. 
Therefore, in the SZDSZ, the view now prevails that, in the 
issue of the minorities over the border, progress has to be made 
toward making collective rights recognized. Szent-Ivanyi 
admitted that his Bucharest negotiating partners touched upon 
the unresolved situation of the parliamentary representation of 
national minorities in Hungary. However, the SZDSZ delegation 
explained that further talks are being held in Hungary on this 
issue and, on the other hand, the legal provisions that have 
been enacted in Hungary -- mainly the law on national minorities 
-- are still to be achieved by the parliaments of the 
neighboring countries.

<F P=106> [Dorina Baesu report: "The Atmosphere in the Army Is Tense"] </F>
  [Text] Sources within the armed forces have told us that 
the atmosphere is currently very tense among the officers, and 
even among the lower ranks, owing to the appointment of the new 
[national defense] minister, Gheorghe Tinca. First, because for 
the first time a civilian -- who is not familiar with military 
issues -- is leading the armed forces, and second, because many 
of the members of the Army Intelligence Direction claim that 
Tinca used to work for the Securitate, more precisely for SIE 
[Foreign Intelligence Service]. During the reign of the 
deceased [former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu] it was known that 
the Army and the Securitate used to loath each other. The 
memory of those times still persists. Had it not been for the 
precedent of the CADA [Action Committee for the Democratization 
of the Army, an organization of young officers immediately after 
December 1989], when the attempt by certain officers to revolt 
against the army leadership was suppressed, many officers would 
now react more harshly, the sources said.

  [Text] During a National Romanian Unity Party [PUNR] news 
conference held yesterday, [Deputy Party Chairman] Ioan Gavra 
admitted that on 1 March the PUNR leaders examined the 
personalities of the experts proposed [by the government party] 
to take over the leadership of the Justice Ministry and the 
Transportation Ministry, and they supported the persons who were 
appointed as ministers on Sunday [6 March]. 
  Ioan Gavra stated that Iosif Gavril Chiuzbaian was proposed 
as a candidate for the Ministry of Justice by Pavel Suian, 
brother of Valer Suian, first deputy chairman of the party 
[PUNR]. 
  Horia Pop [Brasov PUNR deputy] added: "It cannot be excluded 
that he will join the PUNR in the future." 
  Talking about the second stage of the government reshuffle, 
Gavra asserted that the new ministers will also be technocrats: 
"In the end, the government will consists of more experts than 
Social Democracy Party of Romania members, because we need 
experts to pull the country out of the current crisis."

<F P=106> [Article by Claudiu Harceaga: "Good-bye Hope! At a Meeting </F>
With Heads of Other States, Ion Iliescu Introduces Adrian 
Nastase as the Future President of Romania"] 
  [Text] We have learned through foreign diplomatic channels 
and from well-documented and verified sources that Ion Iliescu, 
at various meetings held with leaders or prime ministers of 
other countries, is introducing Adrian Nastase [president of the 
Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian parliament and leader of the 
ruling Social Democracy Party of Romania, PDSR] as the future 
president of Romania. If Nastase is not present at the 
respective meeting, the current president is recommending him to 
foreign diplomats as the major partner for dialogue in his 
absence and the person who will accomplish the reform and the 
current political orientation (which is basically a neocommunist 
orientation!) of Romania. The respective situation should not 
surprise us if we recall the behavior of the president of the 
Chamber of Deputies in the past year: He blocked the 
extraordinary session of the parliament in December 1993, has 
come closer to the tough wing of the PDSR, and mainly, 
repeatedly threatened that if the opposition continues to 
support the idea that His Majesty Mihai I of Romania is the only 
solution for pulling Romania out of crisis, the party that he 
leads will institute a dictatorial regime. 
  Thus, after confiscating the revolution and after pushing 
the 
country into chaos and poverty, Ion Iliescu is not letting 
things slide but is carefully preparing our future. Considering 
that at the next general elections the current president of 
Romania will not be able to run for office again, and that the 
levers of a rule-of-law state (is it indeed a rule-of-law 
state?) are in the hands of the ruling party, it is obvious that 
the PDSR president must "graduate" on time from Ion Iliescu's 
political school.

  [Text] Romanian President Ion Iliescu returned to 
Bucharest this evening after a week-long tour of Lithuania, 
South Korea, and several economic areas in the south of China. 
At Otopeni airport the Romanian head of state made a statement 
to the press on the results of his talks and contacts with 
politicians and businessmen in the three countries. 
  Referring to his visit to Lithuania, Iliescu emphasized the 
importance of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and 
Cooperation between the two countries, which augments the series 
of legal documents regulating the framework of bilateral 
relations. Both in Lithuania and in Belarus, where he made a 
stopover and met with the new head of state, the sides expressed 
the desire to consolidate bilateral ties. 
  The Asian tour started with a visit to the ROK, the first 
official Romanian visit to that country at the level of heads of 
state. The visit, President Ion Iliescu said, was a political 
event that was given its due attention by both the mass media 
and the political leadership of that country, which expressed 
the desire to consolidate relations with Romania. President Ion 
Iliescu emphasized that our country should show greater interest 
in South Korea and the economic region of southeast Asia in 
general since that is the most dynamic region in the world. In 
this respect, he referred to various aspects of his meetings 
with the representatives of some big companies that have 
cooperation relations with Romanian companies. On the occasion 
of those meetings, the local businessmen expressed their 
interest in investing in the Romanian economy. 
  Referring to his visit to the special economic zone in the 
southern part of China, Ion Iliescu described it as an area that 
has registered spectacular progress in the past 15 years, which 
took concrete shape in the development of several strong urban 
centers. Foreign capital investment in the region has acquired 
great proportions, with the respective zones dynamizing the 
entire Chinese economy, which is in full process of 
modernization and has taken a decisive turn toward the 
mechanisms of the market economy. 
  In conclusion, President Ion Iliescu said that the tour, 
which is part of a program of opening up toward regions of great 
interest, has been characterized, on the one hand, by a 
highlevel political dialogue to consolidate bilateral ties and, 
on the other hand, by important economic considerations, 
something that could also be seen from the composition of the 
Romanian delegation.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Bucharest Radio Romania Network in 
Romanian at 1005 GMT on 14 March carries a live relay from 
Victoria Hall in Bucharest of a news conference by Prime 
Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu on economic, agricultural, and reform 
issues and the recent government reshuffle. 
  In his one-hour introductory statement, Nicolae Vacaroiu 
discusses the government's activity over the past year and five 
months and the "difficult period Romania experienced in 1993," 
which, he says, "will continue in 1994." He says that the 
government carried out his activity on the "basis of the 
government program and strategy" aimed at "implementing the 
Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] policy, that of the 
ruling party." 
  Vacaroiu says that 1993 was "the first year in which we 
succeeded in stopping the decline of production." He stresses 
that "Romania's foreign debts did not increase in 1993" and that 
"priority was given to agriculture, which is the branch that has 
to ensure the consumption base for the population." After 
pointing out the potential that exists in this area, he stresses 
that "the association and privatization process has to be 
intensified" and "agricultural machinery and equipment have to 
be ensured." Vacaroiu points out that "although we have 
recorded an increase of 12 percent in agriculture on the whole, 
we are still faced by particularly difficult problems," 
especially in the "animal-breeding sector." 
  After emphasizing that the transition process is much more 
complex than expected and that one of the "essential problems is 
changing the mentality of people, and their adjustment to a 
market economy," Vacaroiu says that a "radical change" is needed 
and trade companies have to adjust "while we move on." 
  Discussing 1994, he predicts a "slight economic increase." 
He continues to say that the "GNP is estimated to grow by 1.5 
percent in 1994, industrial output by 2 percent, and exports by 
7 percent, while imports are expected to decrease by 2 percent." 
He assesses that the unemployment rate will be 12 percent and 
consumer costs will increase 15 percent. After stressing that 
the price increase was 295.5 percent in 1993, while that of net 
incomes was only 210.6 percent, thus causing a decline in the 
standard of living, Vacaroiu says that at the end of 1993 the 
average pay was 54 percent compared with that in 1990. 
  Discussing priority goals for 1994, Vacaroiu says that the 
"main goal in 1994 is to relaunch and stabilize the economy," 
increase "the coherence of the economic and social reform 
process," with "emphasis, of course, on the restructuring, 
privatization process, and on social protection." He assesses 
that the standard of living "will not deteriorate in the first 
half of 1994," but that it will even "increase 10 percent" in 
the second half of the year. 
  After stressing the need to "invigorate Romanian industry 
along with the restructuring and privatization process," 
Vacaroiu mentions the "measures included in the memorandum with 
the IMF." 
  Discussing industrial production in January, he says that it 
"increased 1.8 percent compared with last December and 5.5 
percent compared with the previous January," while "productivity 
increased 1.6 percent compared with December and 10.1 percent 
compared with January last year." 
  The prime minister warns, however, that this does not mean 
that "things are back to normal," but that Romania is still 
experiencing a "particularly drastic economic crisis" that may 
still have "harsh negative effects on the economy and life in 
general." 
  After discussing the "January surplus trade balance," 
Vacaroiu stresses that the foreign currency policy is of great 
importance, since it is the one to "contribute to macroeconomic 
stability." He continues to discuss other banking and state 
budget issues. 
  Regarding the restructuring program and the privatization 
process, Vacaroiu discusses procedural matters and the important 
role to be played by the stock exchange. 
  At 1047 GMT Prime Minister Vacaroiu begins discussing the 
recent government reshuffle, explaining the reasons behind the 
replacement of the four ministers of defense, interior, justice, 
and transportation. 
  He admits that "we are still facing great problems in the 
area of corruption, violations, and tax evasion." In connection 
with the replacement of the minister of defense, Vacaroiu says 
that "Romania's Army has to represent a symbol of the country, 
it has to guarantee stability, credibility, and must by no means 
be involved in various disputes -- political or of any other 
nature." 
  After presenting the merits of each newly appointed 
minister, 
Vacaroiu speaks about the problem of financial blockage and the 
need to eliminate it. 
  Discussing agricultural issues, Vacaroiu points out actions 
that have been taken to support this sector "with certain sums 
of money from the budget," through the "sale of agricultural 
machinery and equipment on credit," and through "priority 
actions in the area of privatization." 
  Vacaroiu concludes his introductory statement by emphasizing 
that "a number of actions have been taken" to "give an impetus 
to small-and medium-sized private entrepreneurs" in order "to 
guarantee their financial sources."

<F P=106> [Article by Mihail Mihailescu: "The Dukedom of Bessarabia"] </F>
  [Text] Ruining the favorable moment for the country's 
reunification -- something that could even mean losing 
Bessarabia for good -- is subtly and indirectly blamed by the 
government on the empire in the east that desires restoration 
and that cannot be stopped by the West. Indeed, Russia has 
economic and strategic interests in Bessarabia and certainly 
wants to preserve its former assets in spheres of influence. 
Similarly, the West does not have a clear idea of the identity 
of Bessarabia as Romanian soil. The West knows that Russia has 
to be protected to avoid a large-scale explosion. These things, 
however, are not the explanation for the fact that nothing has 
come of our country's reintegration. 
  It was simply the stubbornness of Snegur [Moldovan 
president] 
and that of the communist oligarchy to preserve their 
privileges, or to be more than they were after the collapse of 
the Soviet empire. In 1991, under Snegur's leadership, 
Bessarabia proclaimed its independence and called itself the 
Republic of Moldova. The Romanian Government acclaimed it. 
Since the situation was not yet clear, Mircea Snegur was talking 
about the development, over a short period, of the Republic of 
Moldova, after which the problem would be posed of returning to 
the mother country, "as would be normal." 
  Snegur and the others began their game. First, one by one, 
they rid themselves of the patriotic intellectuals, who demand 
unification. Then they accepted assistance from Romania on the 
grounds of a brother in despair, only to turn to the Russians, 
from where they get their fuel. In this way they are able to 
maintain a minimum standard of living, which, however, offers a 
certain stability and the possibility not to begin the reform 
process. 
  It never crossed their mind to open the border with Romania. 
All this time, Bessarabia is conducting fierce propaganda for 
the independence of the great republic. The war in the Dniester 
region was a break during which it consolidated its popularity 
-- there is someone who earnestly concerns himself with the 
country during hard times. In actual fact, however, Snegur lost 
the Dniester region. 
  Then came the climax -- the 27 February elections and 6 
March 
referendum. Snegur gathered around himself all former communist 
nomenklatura members. He turned definitively toward Russia, 
promising that he would stay in its sphere of influence. He 
lashes out at Romania because it is the only one that can take 
away his power -- by annexing Bessarabia. In Mircea Snegur's 
view, the Romanians and Bessarabians are not only not the same 
people, but not even brothers. And soon the Romanian language 
will probably be prohibited in Bessarabia. 
  All this was possible with the help of a good friend from 
Romania -- President Ion Iliescu. Both have studied in 
Muscovite schools. The similarity in the way Snegur and Iliescu 
developed is striking. Iliescu organized a referendum and the 
Constitution was adopted -- Romania became a semi-presidential 
republic. Through the elections in 1992, Iliescu has a 
parliament, which he controls. Snegur has a puppet parliament 
and, through the referendum on independence, he became the great 
communist duke of the Dukedom of Bessarabia. Iliescu tramples on 
the fallen heroes of December 1989. Snegur tramples on the 
heroes fallen in the Dniester war. Iliescu loses Bessarabia, 
Snegur loses Dniester. Both are sending out signals of love to 
Moscow. 
  Terrible times are in store for Bessarabia -- it is much 
easier to install an absolute dictatorship in a small dukedom. 
And, as long as the Iliescu bloc is in power, not much can be 
done for Bessarabia. History can no longer be falsified -- the 
monarchy brought Bessarabia back to the country, the Iliescu 
bloc lost it. 
  And a question -- if Romania were to claim Bessarabia, would 
Snegur call the Russians and would he shoot at the Romanians?

  [Text] Salonika, 14 Mar (TANJUG) -- Biljana Plavsic, deputy 
president of the Srpska republic, who is on a visit to Salonika, 
has said that the possible arrival of Turkish soldiers in Bosnia 
could lead to an escalation of war, the Macedonian News Agency 
[MPA] office in Salonika reports. 
  If Turkish soldiers were sent to Bosnia the Serb political 
leadership would not be able to control the reaction of the Serb 
people, Plavsic said, and added that the Serbs in Bosnia were 
not defending just their own thing but also the Orthodox faith 
and Byzantine civilization. 
  Evangelos Venizelos, representative of the Greek Government, 
reiterated the Greek Government's position that no Balkan 
country should be involved in the war in Bosnia, MPA says. 
  The agency recalls a statement by Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias that Greece would consider sending its own 
Blue Helmets to Bosnia if the UN secretary general accepted the 
participation of Turkish peacekeeping forces in the peacekeeping 
operation in Bosnia.

  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Mar (TANJUG) -- The general staff of 
the army of the Srpska republic says that UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] members and UN helicopter units today brazenly 
violated the UN humanitarian mission and, by openly siding with 
the Muslim side, threatened the confidence created in our 
cooperation so far, according to the general staff's information 
service. 
  In a routine check at Sokolac heliport, it was found that in 
addition to a Muslim delegation, UNPROFOR was attempting to 
transport a large number of packages containing electronic 
equipment, uncleared documents, and a huge quantity of foreign 
currency from Sarajevo to Gorazde. 
  When a control team of the army of the Srpska republic 
insisted on continuing a thorough search, a member of the Muslim 
delegation, Edib Bukvic, deputy prime minister in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina government, opposed it. He decided that the 
delegation should not continue its journey. The two UN 
helicopters then returned safely to Sarajevo. 
  The general staff communique says that UNPROFOR had asked 
for 
permission from the general staff for the Muslim delegation and 
the chairman of the Srpska republic commission for POW exchange 
to be flown by helicopter to Gorazde. It was explained that 
this was a humanitarian mission that was necessary for the 
speedier resolution of the POW problem. 
  The flight was not permitted at first for security reasons, 
and the UNPROFOR command was advised to recommend that the 
delegation travel by land. Permission was nevertheless granted 
after the UNPROFOR command had asked the president of the Srpska 
republic and after both the Muslim side and UNPROFOR had given 
firm guarantees about the safety of the flight over the 
separation lines. 
  The general staff says that it had been precisely set out 
that the helicopters could only transport members of the 
delegation with their personal belongings and lists of POW's. 
When the helicopters arrived in Sokolac the chairman of the 
state commission of the Srpska republic was not to be found in 
either helicopter.

  [Text] The first plane landed at Tuzla airport today after 
almost two years of waiting. The wheels of the plane bearing UN 
insignia touched down on the runway of the Dubrave airport this 
morning, or, to be more precise, at 1145. The landing of the 
first plane at Tuzla airport passed without any incidents. 
General Michael Rose, commander of the UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] for Bosnia-Herzegovina, was in the plane, as were 
some of the staff who will take care of the delivery of 
humanitarian aid to this region in the future. 
  As we have found out from sources close to UNPROFOR, over 
the 
next few days some of the equipment necessary for navigation and 
fire prevention is expected to arrive at Tuzla airport. 
  In a way, the landing of the first plane bearing UN insignia 
marks the fact that Tuzla airport has started functioning. As 
for the official opening, that will depend on the political 
decisions made at the level of the United Nations.

  [Text] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, March 14 (AFP) -- UN 
commander Lieutenant General Michael Rose made a brief stop 
Monday at the newly reopened Tuzla airport in northeast Bosnia, 
as it prepares to restart aid deliveries to the beseiged town. 
  The British general, head of the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, spent two hours at the base 
which was handed over to UN control last week by the 
mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army after being closed since May 1992, 
shortly after the outbreak of the war. Peacekeeping troops have 
been clearing the airport area of mines left by a succession of 
Yugoslav, Serb, and Bosnian forces. 
  Rose had been "pleased" by the advanced state of repairs on 
the runway, base commander Lieutenant-Colonel Hans Jorgen 
Nielsen told journalists Monday. Asked about the date of the 
first flight into Tuzla, Nielsen said it was a "question of 
days." "We have been ready (...) for four or five days. It 
will come when the politicians have taken a decision," he 
explained. 
  The first arrival will be an UNPROFOR flight bringing 
technical material to prepare an airlift of humanitarian aid for 
the people of northern Bosnia, who are surrounded by Bosnian 
Serb forces.

  [Text] Mostar cannot be a divided city, and the Bosniak 
Muslim people will never agree to this long-suffering, 
massacred, and humiliated city becoming the center of a canton 
with a Croatian majority. This is the view of the Party of 
Democratic Action [SDA] for Mostar. 
  Such an outcome of a 10-month-long siege of Mostar by the 
Croatian aggressor would present a direct award to the 
attackers, who have committed unprecedented crimes in this 
region against the Bosniak Muslim people. Contrary to such a 
regressive option, the Bosniak Muslim people from Mostar and the 
Neretva River valley are committed to an open and cosmopolitan 
city. The political representatives of this nation at all the 
future political activities aimed at solving the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina drama will promote only this option, based on 
five strategic principles, including the demand that all the 
expelled and displaced people of Mostar and the Neretva River 
valley return to their homes of origin, where their personal 
safety and protection of property will be guaranteed, that the 
crimes and criminals on all the warring sides are punished, and 
that, in future solutions for Mostar -- in accordance with the 
initiatives of the European Union -- their direct participation 
in the administration of this city is guaranteed. 
  These are the fundamental commitments of the SDA for Mostar, 
whose newly appointed municipal committee again reiterates that 
there can be no deviation from the party program defined clearly 
earlier, and the principles of the struggle for Mostar and its 
fate. 
  As Mr. Safet Orucevic, chairman of the municipal committee, 
stressed, the SDA for Mostar extends its full political support 
to the Bosnia-Herzegovina state delegation led by Mr. Alija 
Izetbegovic in its attempts at definitely solving the bloody 
Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis through political means.

and overponderous administrative procedures and policies," which 
prevented any effective response being made to the acts of 
aggression to which UN troops are falling victim. "I believe it 
is essential that the decisionmaking process at the United 
Nations is such that the effectiveness of responses can be 
assured under good conditions whenever a response is required. 
Too frequently this is not the case." In the case of the Serbian 
tank aggression, "once again, it took more than one hour for the 
administrative procedures to run their course," affirmed the 
prime minister. 
  According to the military personnel on the ground, the 
request to respond has been made at 2217 local time by the 
commander of the French battalion, and the green light was only 
given by the UN special representative, Mr. Yashusi Akashi, (the 
sole individual there empowered to order an air strike) at 2315 
[local time]. This version of events was implicitly confirmed by 
a NATO spokesman in Rome. He indicated that the two aircraft 
which arrived over Bihac received shortly afterwards the order 
not to intervene because "the shooting had ceased." 
  Edouard Balladur had come out with his reproaches Sunday 
morning, during a talk with Yasushi Akashi in Zagreb. He 
announced that, together with [Defense Minister] Francois 
Leotard and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, he would "study the 
proposals that might be made with a view to accelerating the 
process so that decisions to respond be made in time and not 
when the moment had passed. It is essential that our troops 
benefit here from optimal conditions of safety and protection, 
because they are not indulging in warring activities, but 
participating in humanitarian operations." 
  The criticisms made by Edouard Balladur echo those made by 
General Cot, the UNPROFOR commander, who -- back in January -- 
had already taken issue over the ponderousness of the 
decisionmaking process leading up to an air strike in response 
[to hostilities in violation of the cease-fire]. At the time he 
suggested that the UNPROFOR commander be empowered to make the 
decision. The French Government has also called into question 
the behavior of the UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia, the British 
General Michael Rose, who is second-in-command to General Cot. 
Last Thursday, according to Francois Leotard, the UN troops in 
Bihac had called for air support "but General Rose had rejected 
their call." According to French military sources, relations 
between the French leaders and the British general, who the 
former reproach for having adopted "too personal" an approach in 
managing the situation in Bosnia, are not looking rosy. 
  Paris also fears that Bihac could become a major center of 
confrontation. Since the beginning of February the latter [not 
further specified] have in fact reinforced their presence by 
several thousand men. Within the context of an agreement 
between the Croats and the Muslims, the railway (along the river 
Una, in the south of the pocket), which constitutes the 
boundary, is of great strategic importance, for it represents 
the sole link between Knin in Serbian Krajina and Belgrade, 
thereby ensuring the continuity of Serbian territory.

  [Text] Belgrade, Mar 14 (TANJUG) -- Troops of the Fifth 
Corp of the Bosnian Moslem Army are responsible for the death of 
a French peace-keeper killed last Friday near Bihac (western 
Bosnia), the Bosnian Serb News Agency SRNA on Monday evening 
quoted well informed Serb military sources as saying. 
  The sources said that they had obtained the information from 
circles close to the command of the French battalion of the U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) stationed in Coralici near Cazin. 
  SRNA recalled that the Serb side was immediately accused of 
being responsible for the death of the French soldier at one of 
the UNPROFOR observation posts on the Bihac front although the 
circumstances and motives for the killing remained unclarified 
until this very day.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris </F>
Silajdzic by Robert Hochner in Vienna; Silajdzic statements in 
English with superimposed German translation -- live] 
  [Text] [Hochner] I welcome Bosnian Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic in the studio. Good evening, Mr. Prime Minister. 
  [Silajdzic] Good evening. 
  [Hochner] Mr. Prime Minister, the Muslims and Croats have 
agreed on a constitution in Vienna but not on a new map. What 
will be the next step -- talks on a new map, or talks with the 
Serbs on the return of territories? 
  [Silajdzic] Well, let me tell you first that we are very 
glad that these negotiations are taking place in Austria, in 
Vienna, because the Austrian Government has spent a great deal 
of time and energy on this peace process. To answer your 
question, we are not yet discussing maps. We have to talk to 
the Serbian side to achieve a final settlement. 
  [Hochner] It looks as though the Muslims and Croats might 
form a military alliance. Can you imagine that Croats and 
Muslims might take joint action against the Serbs and recapture 
the territories which they claim if no agreement should be 
achieved on a new map, for example? 
  [Silajdzic] We believe that this draft constitution is a 
victory for peace and not for war. But everything is possible 
after two years of violence. After a very difficult situation 
of suffering, everything is possible. Yet, as I said, we 
sincerely hope for peace and not for war. We hope that the 
human rights mentioned in the draft constitution will have real 
meaning -- the right to life, the right to freedom, the right to 
free movement, the right to think, and the right to think 
differently. We hope that these things will be respected. They 
are all stipulated in the constitution. 
  [Hochner] The Russians have recently intervened in the peace 
process in Bosnia. They reportedly cooperate very closely with 
the United States. However, there are also fears that a new 
East-West border will be established politically in the middle 
of your country. How do you assess the influence of the 
Russians? 
  [Silajdzic] Well, I was in Moscow three days ago, and I 
openly spoke about our worries concerning this kind of Russian 
engagement. We cannot ignore one fact: that Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy visited the occupied part of Bosnia-Herzegovina a 
few weeks ago, and that he gave nationalistic and incendiary 
speeches. A few weeks later, Russian troops came to Bosnia 
without being invited. The Bosnian Government was not 
consulted, and the troops were deployed on some lines in 
Sarajevo. We are afraid of a division of Sarajevo. We are 
afraid of a new Berlin Wall there. We will naturally do 
everything possible to prevent another Berlin Wall there. But 
we are worried. 
  [Hochner] The UN embargo against the rest of Yugoslavia 
might be used as an instrument to exert pressure on the Bosnian 
Serbs. Do you believe that a lifting of the embargo might be 
promised to the rest of Yugoslavia to achieve a compromise among 
the Serbs in Bosnia? 
  [Silajdzic] Are you talking about the arms embargo? 
  [Hochner] I am speaking about the economic embargo. 
  [Silajdzic] Yes, of course. But that should be done very 
cautiously. It must be done strictly in accordance with the 
withdrawal. I think that this is the only effective instrument 
in the hands of the international community. Unfortunately, the 
civilian population is affected by the embargo. That seems to 
be inevitable in order to make the Belgrade regime behave. 
  [Hochner] Let me ask you a final question, Mr. Prime 
Minister. The Croats and the Bosnian-Muslim army of the 
government waged a bloody war against each other. Negotiations 
are now being held. How stable is the new basis of trust between 
the two ethnic groups? Do you think it might break again? 
  [Silajdzic] As I said, everything can happen. Yet a direct 
and very important result of these talks is a stable cease-fire, 
particularly in Sarajevo and Mostar. This encourages us and 
gives us hope to continue. We hope for the best. 
  [Hochner] Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for the interview. 
  [Silajdzic] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister </F>
Haris Silajdzic in Vienna by Nermin Karamehmedovic in Sarajevo 
on 14 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Karamehmedovic] Mr. Silajdzic, let me first greet 
you, and then ask you to assess the developments in Vienna. 
  [Silajdzic] As you know, the draft constitution has been 
completed. The constitution is based on the international 
subjectivity and integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, so this is an 
issue of an internal transformation of the constitutional 
organization. The constitutional solutions remain open to the 
third side, as does the entire peace process. These are the 
main points. I can say that the proposed solutions are based on 
the well-known democratic solutions and the guarantees of the 
highest standards of human rights, including the collective, 
individual, and ethnic rights. 
  The constitution establishes a federation with the usual 
competencies and the manner of decisionmaking that guarantees 
the principles of national equality and the influence of the 
democratic and multiparty political system. The agreement and 
the constitution imply the mechanisms of integrating 
Bosnia-Herzegovina into the integration processes, domestic and 
international guarantees of human rights and, if I may stress, 
particular stress is placed on human rights in this document, 
that is, human rights follow immediately after the establishment 
of the federation. Why? We believe, all of us here, that the 
case of Bosnia-Herzegovina is a case of an unprecedented 
violation of human rights. That means that we have to get used 
to the fact that human rights are not just an appendage, but 
rather the main point. We all have to get used to that. We 
have to try and live by that. All the people, all the 
individuals, on the territory of the federation enjoy the right 
to life, to freedom, to equality before the law, to no 
discrimination based on race, creed, language, political 
beliefs, and so on. All the people have the right to privacy, 
to freedom of movement, to asylum, to property, to the 
fundamental freedoms, the freedom of speech, the freedom of 
press, the freedom of thought, consciousness, belief, religion, 
and so on. These are the fundamental freedoms that we will try 
and apply in reality. They are of course on paper in this 
document. I would like to stress that. The rest is practically 
technical stuff. 
  [Karamehmedovic] You stated yesterday that this document, 
this agreement, is an important step toward the global solution 
to Bosnia-Herzegovina. The next step [words indistinct] is an 
attempt to try and get the Serb side to join the agreement in 
some form. Are you an optimist in that respect? 
  [Silajdzic] I must say that I am not. The statements issued 
by the representatives of the aggressor's side so far do not 
seem to indicate that they are willing to join this process. We 
of course wish they would, but if one is to base one's 
conclusion on the statements that we have heard, then (?that 
will not be the case). 
  [Karamehmedovic] Finally, there was an announcement that 
perhaps next weekend the official signing of the documents could 
take place, with President Alija Izetbegovic of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, and Croatian President Franjo 
Tudjman. Do you think it could happen within this announced 
deadline? 
  [Silajdzic] Yes, Presidents Izetbegovic and Tudjman would 
sign the documents concerning the intention to form a 
confederation, that is, on the international level, and the 
documents concerning the constitution of the federation. I 
think that could happen on the 18th [of March], that is, on the 
set date.

republic, to a group of unidentified correspondents after talks 
with Russian envoy Churkin in Belgrade on 14 March -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] 
Was there any talk about the division of Sarajevo? [words 
indistinct] 
  [Koljevic] There was no specific discussion about the 
division of Sarajevo. There were some ideas that everyone would 
have authority in his own Sarajevo, and it does not need to be 
called the Muslim Sarajevo or the Serbian Sarajevo. It is far 
more important for us that people enjoy their political rights 
on those territories that they control -- this refers to 
Sarajevo -- than what kind of a name this will bear temporarily. 
  [Correspondent] Were there any demands for new territorial 
concessions, as it is evident that the issue of demarcation...? 
  [Koljevic, interrupting] No, the demarcation issue will 
naturally be very difficult; however, the style of these 
mediators is different. They would not raise an issue that has 
not arrived on the agenda yet. Above all, they want to create a 
very solid basis in order to accomplish success and have the 
most difficult talks about demarcation come last, when it would 
no longer be possible to cross over into a different situation 
without an agreement. 
  [Correspondent] How do you comment on the latest U.S. 
proposals about the possibility of an independent state of 
Serbian Republic? 
  [Koljevic] I think that these are very interesting 
proposals, however, we must study their legal implications. 
  [Correspondent] Thanks!

  [Text] Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the Russian 
president, has just ended his talks with the representatives of 
the Serbian Republic. Let us listen to the assessment by Nikola 
Koljevic [vice president of the republic of Srpska]: 
  [Begin recording] [Koljevic] I believe that the talks were 
very brief, very concrete, and very efficient. We did not find 
out in what way and within what framework the next talks will be 
held, that is to say, in what way the Serbs will be involved, 
however, we have laid a sort of basis for participation. 
  It seems to us that prior to any sort of official 
participation after the signing of the federation agreement 
between the Muslims and the Croats, we must primarily accomplish 
peace, sign a document on peace and not about a cease-fire. 
Namely, the only thing that we can fear is the formation of a 
new military alliance, while everything else is their free will. 
  Therefore, first of all we will be interested in 
establishing 
peace and in the document about peace, and then in the talks of 
our side with the federation on an equal footing, which would 
mean without sanctions. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Were there any concrete proposals 
today? 
  [Koljevic] There were concrete proposals regarding the 
situation on the ground today as evidently greater efforts are 
aimed at establishing peace on the ground than on further 
problems regarding the constitutional order, that is to say, 
federation, confederation, and with whom. There was some 
mention of Tuzla, that is, in what way could the Serbian 
observers be incorporated in light of the fact that the Muslim 
side had rejected the initial proposal. Also discussed was that, 
if a sort of federation and confederation is being created, the 
Serbs would normally be interested in very close links, not to 
say a confederation, with Yugoslavia. Actually, we have never 
left Yugoslavia, legally speaking. All these problems regarding 
the political solution will arise. They were not raised today 
because the new mediators evidently care most about success on 
the ground and success with two sides, and to accomplish some 
success with the third side later. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Were you officially invited to join 
the negotiations? 
  [Koljevic] This was not officially offered to us, because 
this was not an official meeting. We must create the framework, 
officially. However, it is perfectly clear that this offer is 
on the table and will be proposed to us. It is difficult to 
imagine, bearing in mind that the other two sides have already 
rejected the possibility of a confederation with Yugoslavia, 
that this will be a serious option. However, all this will only 
come into consideration when the official talks with the Serbian 
side will commence. [end recording]

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 15 March carries in its 
regular 5-minute newscast the following reports on the fighting 
in the republic. 
  Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Sermic reports on the 
situation 
in the area and says that "several 120-mm howitzer shells were 
fired at the town center this morning, while antiaircraft 
machine guns and snipers are blasting away at all the 
residential areas of the town." 
  Mirza Sadikovic, reporting from Bihac, says that "since 2200 
last night until the time of filing this report, it seems that 
the fighting has abated somewhat. The Bihac town center and 
Cazin are being targeted less frequently. However, mortars and 
howitzers are still targeting the outskirts of both the Cazin 
and Bihac municipalities, as well as roads and the Bihac 
industrial zone. Although less intensely, artillery and 
antiaircraft weapons are still active on the defense lines. 
There has been an intensification of sniper activity. In the 
early morning hours, 10 tank and mortar shells were fired at the 
Grmusko-Srbljanksi plateau and Grabez. Moreover, there was some 
activity overnight on the (?Stotejski) and Pljesivica part of 
the front which is part of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] 
operational zone. Provocations have also been registered last 
night and this morning on the confrontation lines with the 
remnants of the so-called para-army of the Kladusa autonomy." 
  An unidentified correspondent from the 3d Corps Information 
Center reports that "the cease-fire with the HVO is mostly 
holding. Only single extremist soldiers have violated the 
cease-fire with small arms provocations in the Lasva River 
valley and around Gornji Vakuf." 
  Correspondent Enes Sakic reports from the 4th Corps Press 
Center in Mostar and says that "in the region of the North 
Operative Group, the cease-fire has been observed by both sides. 
Only the forces of the Serbian aggressor used howitzers and 
mortars to shatter the calm." 
  An unnamed correspondent from the 1st Corps Information 
Center says that "this morning again shows that the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army troops are the only ones who are 
observing the cease-fire, while the Chetniks started their 
activity early this morning from their positions around the 
city. A sniper wounded one of our (?soldiers) in the region of 
Stup, while another two soldiers were wounded in Dobrinja. 
Therefore, it is to be expected that the chetnik killers, 
unscrupulous yet sadly unpunished, will today continue their 
activities, so citizens are warned to exercise the usual caution 
when moving around the city."

  [Text] Over the past 24 hours, the chetniks from Bajic 
Kamen in the Mt. Ozren region used a B-1 gun to shell the 
village of Sijevo. The enemy is continuously regrouping along 
the entire 133-km long defense line. Moreover, significant 
movements of motorized vehicles have been sighted in the region 
of Kokice and Novi Seher. Our reconnaissance units report that 
the woods in Sijakovac were ablaze all night, and that it was 
Croats and Muslims, mobilized in Doboj and Teslic, who were 
forced to set fire to them. As we file this report, the chetniks 
are fiercely but unsuccessfully attacking units of the (?111th) 
Croatian Defense Council Zepce Brigade. 
  This has been Smajl Terzic reporting from the 7th South

  [Text] Novi Sad, March 14 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Deputy 
Foreign Minister Radoslav Bulajic said that the Hungarian 
minority in Serbia's northern province of Vojvodina already has 
cultural autonomy so such demands by the National Party of 
Ethnic Hungarians in this Serbian province are unnecessary. In a 
statement to Radio Novi Sad, Bulajic specified that the 
Hungarian minority in Vojvodina had classes in its mother tongue 
from kindergarten to university, that it had radio and TV 
programmes in Hungarian as well as its own theatres, cultural, 
art and sports associations. Bulajic's statement was prompted by 
his meeting with Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky in 
Novi Sad on Sunday. Jeszensky urged Yugoslav and Serbian 
authorities to meet the requests of the Democratic Community of 
Vojvodina Hungarians (DZVM) for a cultural autonomy. 
  Jeszenszky paid an unofficial visit to Vojvodina to attend 
the centennial commemorating the death of Hungarian 
revolutionary Kossuth Lajos which was organized by the DZVM. 
  Bulajic underscored that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 
more than any other neighbouring country, enabled all minorities 
to exercise their human rights, even beyond the standards and 
norms stipulated by international documents. Commenting on the 
conclusions of the U.N. Commission for Human Rights adopted at a 
recent session in Geneva on an alleged violation of human rights 
in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Bulajic stressed that the 
commission was presented with misinformations coming from the 
secessionist movement of ethnic Albanians in Serbia's southern 
province of Kosovo-Metohija. The Yugoslav diplomat said he was 
confident that such misinformations and accusations did not 
exist in Vojvodina, because human rights of national minorities 
were respected in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia more than 
in any other neighbouring country and even beyond international 
standards.

  [Text] New York, March 14 (TANJUG) -- Islamic countries are 
trying, in cooperation with the Bosnian Muslims, to provoke a 
conflict in Raska, a region stretching across both the Yugoslav 
Republics of Serbia and Montenegro, and are, thereby, 
endangering the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Yugoslav Ambassador to the U.N. 
Dragomir Djokic has said. 
  In a letter sent to the U.N. Security Council on Monday, 
Djokic set out that the Muslims in Raska had the same rights as 
all other citizens of the F.R.Y. 
  The Yugoslav ambassador said the accusations presented by 
the 
member-countries of the Organization of the Islamic Conference 
(OIC) in the letter to the U.N. Security Council of March 3, 
according to which the Muslims in Raska were victims of 
repressive measures and persecution, were false and unfounded. 
  Djokic said the OIC was not only falsifying history with the 
presented accusations, but also instigating the spreading of the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which its member-countries 
allegedly wanted to prevent. 
  Djokic said that what was involved was dangerous 
interference 
in the internal affairs of the F.R.Y. and undermining of its 
sovereignty and territorial integrity. He specified that the 
alleged territorial and historical individuality of the 
so-called Sandzak (Turkish name for Raska), on which Islamic 
countries insisted, reflected the territorial claims of 
extremist Muslim forces, that is, their wish to include Raska 
into Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
  The Yugoslav ambassador said the chief goal was to 
internationalize the case of "Sandzak" and have the region break 
away from the Republics of Serbia and Montenegro. 
  Djokic said individual incidents in Raska were strictly the 
doing of terrorist groups, involved in illicit arms trade, which 
he said instigated rebellion for the sake of creating an 
independent state of "Sandzak." The Yugoslav ambassador said 
the F.R.Y. would not hesitate to take all necessary measures to 
protect its constitution, territorial integrity, and legal order. 
  The leaders of the Sarajevo-based extremist Muslim 
Democratic 
Action Party (SDA) for Raska call for the secession of the 
region, where Muslims account for a half of the population, and 
its merger with a Bosnian Muslim state advocated by Bosnian 
Muslim fundamentalist leader Alija Izetbegovic. 
  Authorities in Serbia and Montenegro recently arrested 
members of a Muslim terrorist group who were plotting an armed 
rebellion in Raska. The group leader Sulejman Ugljanin is on the 
run.

  [Excerpt] As it is expected, the start of the first regular 
session of the Serbian Assembly tomorrow will be the sign for 
the election of the new republican government. Prime Minister 
Mirko Marjanovic will present his program to the deputies and 
propose the members of the government, on which a discussion 
will ensue. The deputies will vote for a prime minister and the 
members of the government, together and secretly, that is, 
unless the Assembly opts for public voting, of course. The 
government needs to obtain the votes of a simple majority of the 
total number of deputies in order to be elected. [passage

  [Excerpts] The Serbian Assembly is to start its first 
regular session today at which it is to elect the new Serbian 
Government. Zoran Vaskovic reports from the Assembly building. 
  [Begin Vaskovic recording] Mirko Marjanovic, prime 
minister-elect, is first expected to present his program and 
propose the ministers for the new government. A debate is 
expected to follow. The vote will be in a package, as the saying 
goes, and secret, unless the deputies decide that the vote 
should be public. The government will be elected if over half 
the deputies in the Assembly, that is, at least 126 deputies, 
decide to give it a vote of confidence. [passage omitted] 
  Radio Belgrade will broadcast in full the presentation of 
Prime Minister-elect Marjanovic. At the moment there are still 
some empty seats in the hall, but the deputies are arriving. 
This is all for now from the Serbian Assembly building.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Mihajlovic: "Time Is Ripe for Great Serbia"] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade -- The Serbian Radical Party [SRS] takes 
the view that the present moment is the best opportunity for the 
unification of Serbian lands, Vojislav Seselj, president of the 
SRS, said at a news conference yesterday. 
  "If the Bosnian Jamahiriyah can make a joint state with the 
Croats, who could stop the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK], 
the Srpska republic, and the FRY [Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia] from uniting among themselves," Seselj said, adding 
that one should exploit the West's stands and form a "single, 
unitary state that could be called Great Serbia. Its internal 
organization could be discussed later." 
  The Radicals hold the view that the indecisiveness of the 
authorities regarding the unification is leading into new 
diplomatic mistakes, and that the least that should be done at 
present is to form a joint state of the Srpska republic and the 
RSK, "with one president, one assembly, and one government." 
  The Radicals said that they would speed up the initiative 
they announced last fall on staging a vote of confidence in the 
federal government of Radoje Kontic, and an action on the 
replacement of Radoman Bozovic, chairman of the Chamber of 
Citizens in the Federal Assembly. 
  In response to a question on the possibility of reshuffle of 
Radoje Kontic's cabinet, Seselj said that the reshuffle is in 
fact already completed: "Nikola Sainovic, the exceptionally 
successful head of the Serbian Government, has been made into 
the deputy federal prime minister. It remains to be seen 
whether he will be able to achieve there everything he had 
achieved as Serbian prime minister," Seselj said, ironically. 
  The leader of the Radicals first refused to comment on the 
situation in the Democratic Party (the entry of two members of 
the Democratic Party into the government), but then immediately 
said that this was consistent with the SRS' predictions. The 
Democrats have entered the waters they indicated they would 
during the preelection campaign. They are wrong, however, if 
they think that they will benefit from it, as the socialists are 
crafty. The Democratic Party will be outplayed, Seselj said. 
  The SRS news conference yesterday was also attended by a 
crew 
from Radio and Television of Serbia, after a six-month absence. 
"They are probably looking for something they can use in the 
campaign against our party," Seselj explained, denying rumors 
that there was new, secret friendship between the SRS and the 
Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS].

  [Text] Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic received 
Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special envoy. After 
visiting London, Zagreb, Sarajevo, and Pale, the Russian 
diplomat arrived in Belgrade with a view to finding a 
comprehensive solution to the Bosnian conflict. Here is a 
report by Slobodan Jankovic: 
  [Begin Jankovic recording] The Milosevic-Churkin meting 
lasted one hour. In a brief statement to journalists 
afterwards, Yeltsin's special envoy assessed the talks as 
interesting. Opinions were exchanged on many aspects of the 
crisis on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Anyway, these 
talks were not planned for making important decisions, Vitaliy 
Churkin said among other things and noted that other contacts 
were also necessary before he could speak about any progress. 
  President Milosevic's attitude was flexible as regards the 
Muslim-Croatian federation, Churkin said and added that he 
personally was encouraged by the fact that the agreement on the 
federation could lead to a final peace solution. Churkin did 
not want to give a specific answer to the question as to what 
proposals he had brought to Belgrade, defending this discretion 
with the simple explanation that deliberations were still 
involved that were part of a permanent process. He said that, 
already in the afternoon, he was again leaving for Zagreb to 
continue his mission there. In reply to a journalist's question 
as to what would happen if the Serbian side refused to join the 
federation, Vitaliy Churkin said that refusal was not what the 
Serbian side had in mind when contemplating this idea. He 
reiterated that it was the turn of the Bosnian Serbs' to decide 
what they would do. They need time to study the agreement 
carefully, Churkin said and stressed that he believed that 
everything would proceed in the direction of incorporating and 
not rejecting the idea on confederation. [end recording]

President Yeltsin for former Yugoslavia, to Snezana Rodic in 
Belgrade on 14 March; all questions and answers in English with 
superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Rodic] How do you assess the talks with President 
Milosevic? 
  [Churkin] I believe that this was a very interesting 
conversation in which all the problems in the former Yugoslavia 
were thoroughly examined. This was not a meeting at which 
decisions would be taken. We need further contacts before we 
can report some progress. 
  What I have detected is that at least in this phase, when, 
as 
is my understanding, the Serbs are in the initial stage of 
examining the confederation concept and other elements connected 
to it, President Milosevic has a rather flexible attitude. I am 
particularly encouraged by this and convinced that this 
initiative and the Muslim-Croatian arrangement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina could be incorporated in the search for an 
overall political solution to the problems. 
  [Rodic] Did you bring any new proposals? 
  [Churkin] I offered some thoughts and impressions after the 
talks that I have held in the last few days; however, this is 
part of a continuous process. I am travelling to Zagreb today. 
I believe that the attitude of President Milosevic toward these 
issues is very flexible and constructive and I am satisfied that 
he is also thinking about ways not to reject the new ideas but 
to examine all possibilities that will contribute toward the 
overall political solution, bearing in mind also the idea of 
confederation.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Novi Sad, March 12 (TANJUG) -- President of 
Montenegro Momir Bulatovic has stated that the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) is the factor that cannot be bypassed in 
establishing peace in the Balkans so the respect of its state 
and national interests would help stabilize the region. 
  "Policies which do not respect the real state and national 
interests of Montenegro and Serbia, or the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.), cannot secure peace and stability in the 
Balkans," said Bulatovic in an interview to the NOVI SAD DNEVNIK 
weekly published in the Serbian province of Vojvodina. 
  Hoping in a soon end of the "isolation, sanctions, and 
international oppression being applied to the F.R.Y.," Bulatovic 
said that "those wanting to exhaust ourselves totally can no 
longer justify to their general public the senselessness of 
everything that has been undertaken against the F.R.Y." 
  In May, 1992, the U.N. imposed comprehensive rigorous 
sanctions on the F.R.Y. for its alleged involvement in the civil 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where, however, there have never been 
any Yugoslav soldiers. 
  "Today it is clear to everybody that the Bosnian question is 
being used in an attempt to solve the fate of NATO, relations 
between America and Russia, global unity within the European 
Union (E.U.), and open pretensions of Japan and Germany to 
become permanent members of the U.N. Security Council," said 
Bulatovic. 
  He pointed out that the road now followed by the Yugoslav 
republics Serbia and Montenegro was neither easy nor entirely 
certain, but this was the only possible road "in keeping with 
the historical, state and national interests." 
  He reiterated a joint stand by Montenegro and Serbia that 
the 
Serb people outside the F.R.Y. were entitled to exercisinig 
their freedom and equitable position that presumed also the 
right to self- determination which had already been used by 
other nations in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Denying the right to self-determination to the Serb people 
in 
the forcibly seceded ex-Yugoslav republics was one of the 
principal causes of the current war in the areas of former 
Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Article by Slobodan Rackovic: "All of Sandzak Stands </F>
Accused"] 
  [Text] The prisons in Sandzak could get overcrowded, for 
the Montenegrin-Serb police are very eager to arrest all 
"suspicious Muslims," regardless of which party they belong to, 
although, at the very beginning, the action to "preserve the 
territorial integrity of the FRY [Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia]" was directed exclusively at the SDA [Party of 
Democratic Action] or, to be more precise, toward its 
leadership. (The Montenegrin MUP [Ministry of Interior] 
reported several days ago that they had arrested the 13th 
"Muslim extremist" -- another four are still at large -- but did 
not say which party he belongs to.) Practically every Muslim is 
a suspect here in Sandzak and some municipal assemblies, such as 
that of Bijelo Polje and Berani, publicly gave the police "the 
green light" to continue hunting them down. It is no longer a 
secret that they are after all the Muslims, who have suddenly 
also lost the right to their nationality (in their reports, the 
MUP of Montenegro refers to them as people "of Muslim religion," 
ignoring their nationality!), for they allegedly did not 
disassociate themselves from "those who want to break up 
Yugoslavia." Radonja Zekovic, the famous Serbian chauvinist and 
member of the militant National Party, uttered the following 
threat to all Muslims at the session of the Bijelo Polje 
Municipal Assembly: "The only thing you do is to demand rights 
and you do not fulfill your obligations to your native country, 
with which there is no bargaining." His words met with wide 
approval of committee members of the ruling DPS [Democratic 
Party of Socialists], who say they are a civic party. 
Naturally, in that tub-thumping atmosphere, which has nothing 
to do with parliamentarianism, the proposal to ban the SDA, as 
well as the Liberal Union and the Social Democratic Party, was 
accepted with loud cheers. The same scenario was realized even 
more easily in Berani, which was a well-known Greater-Serbian 
chetnik stronghold during World War II. 
  The Muslims will, therefore, continue to be persecuted 
wherever they are and it would not be surprising if "honest 
Muslims," who (out of fear or naivete) are now hiding in the 
ruling DPS, will be treated in the same way. If it is any 
consolation to them, it will not be much easier for those who 
associate with them either, whether in parties or privately, 
those who are, as a rule, authentic Montenegrins who do not 
admit to be "of Serbian origin" at all and advocate an 
independent state for Montenegro. It is precisely those people 
and professionals like Vladan Djuranovic, Ranko Vukotic, Vesna 
Rajcevic, and Velibor Markovic, as well as Velija Muric and Agil 
Nasufovic, who have engaged in futile efforts to represent the 
13 arrested Muslims from Pljevlje, Bijelo Polje, Rozaj, Berani, 
and Petnjica, who are now in prison (almost all of them since 26 
January this year) and the four others who are on the run, all 
accused of "breaking up Yugoslavia." However, they are almost 
helpless and, in a month of pretrial detention, which has now 
been illegally extended, they saw their clients once for half an 
hour while the latter did not manage to see their families at 
all. 
  Defense attorney Ranko Vukotic said the following: "This is 
an unprecedented violation of all the defense rights in the 
legal system since the time of Cominform. The television 
spectacle in which the suspects presented hidden weapons was 
arranged specially for that occasion, and was carefully aimed at 
preparing the public. Every voice that demands that the 
Constitution be respected, is, regarding this case, treated as 
belonging to traitors or to the enemy." His colleague Velija 
Muric claims that human rights were not denied in this way even 
to the most notorious war criminals. Both attorneys point out 
that it is now most important to end this unconstitutional 
investigation that which denies the accused's rights to have 
defense attorneys and that defendants should be given a public 
trial. 
  The situation is the same in Novi Pazar, where a trial of 
25 Muslims, most of them SDA activists, is under way; they are 
accused of the same "crime" -- "having weapons and breaking up 
Yugoslavia." Those people, most of them from Novi Pazar, have 
already endured the worst -- beating and police pressure in 
pretrial detention. Owing to the lack of evidence, the trial, 
which has unprecedented security measures, is very sloppy: It 
is often interrupted, and the accused deny everything that they 
admitted during the pretrial investigation, claiming that they 
did so under duress. 
  "The investigation was a scandal and a travesty of justice 
as 
it was arranged to make the our defendants look guilty. This is 
a purely political process," says a well-known Belgrade 
attorney, Rajko Danilovic, and attorney Azem Vllasi agrees with 
him and is optimistic about the outcome of the trial. 
  "It is good that the trial was open to the public, so the 
domestic and international public will be able to find out what 
this is all about. People who sympathize with the accused know 
the truth, but the authorities, which want this trial, are 
creating more tension and distrust, although that is another 
unpleasant factor for them," says Vllasi. 
  However, with regard to the domestic public, it seems that 
Mr. Vllasi has no good reason for his optimism. Admission to 
the court house in Novi Pazar (and it will be like this in 
Bijelo Polje too) can only be gained by regime journalists of 
Podgorica and Belgrade's state media, who have already passed 
judgment on the accused. We know how the international public 
will, on the other hand, find out something more about the 
motives and goals of those trials through its journalists, who 
are hard to find indeed, and through diplomats in Belgrade who 
are following the trial in Novi Pazar and will certainly be 
following the one in Bijelo Polje as well, which is bound to 
have higher ratings because of the higher "ranks" of the 
arrested SDA leaders. 
  The Yugoslav authorities will, no doubt, realize their goal 
-- they will definitely destroy the SDA in Sandzak as they have 
all the state instruments necessary to do so. It will be the 
first time since 1946 that a legitimate and legally registered 
party is banned in Yugoslavia, this time significantly broken 
up, which shows that there is actually a quasi-pluralism in the 
deeds of the Montenegrin-Serbian federation, just as there was 
right after World War II.

<F P=106> [Interview with Thorvald Stoltenberg, cochairman of the </F>
Conference on Former Yugoslavia, by Lubos Palata; place and date 
not given: "Thorvald Stoltenberg: The End of War in Bosnia Is 
Coming Near"] 
  [Text] Trieste (From Our Special Correspondent) -- 
Thorvald Stoltenberg is a cochairman of the Conference on Former 
Yugoslavia and the successor to Cyrus Vance in his post of the 
UN main negotiator. For many months he has been trying to 
mediate peace treaties between inimical parties in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. He is one of the most competent people to 
estimate, based on his own experience, the progress in the 
efforts at putting an end to the war in former Yugoslavia. 
Stoltenberg gave an interview to MLADA FRONTA DNES on this 
subject. 
  [Palata] Mr. Stoltenberg, how do you evaluate the most 
recent peace agreement concluded between Zagreb and the Bosnian 
Muslims and Croats in Washington? 
  [Stoltenberg] The Washington treaty is an interesting and 
important step in the right direction. I believe that the 
Muslims and Croats have embarked on the right road. They 
selected the correct time for this, and the document they signed 
is a very good basis for the peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Palata] Has the end of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina come 
any closer after the signing of the treaty? 
  [Stoltenberg] I hope so. It seems to me that a new 
situation has arisen. 
  Lord Owen and I have worked long and hard toward our goal, 
toward which the peace efforts must be aimed. Now, this may 
have succeeded, let us hope. 
  The European Union took the initiative before Christmas. 
Now, the United States and Russia have also joined in. I do 
not believe that it would be possible to arrive at the final 
goal without the European Union, Washington, and Moscow 
cooperating together. 
  [Palata] Does the treaty between the Croats and Muslims mean 
the end of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state? 
  [Stoltenberg] No, certainly not. 
  [Palata] Do you still believe that it would be possible to 
reestablish the country within its former borders? 
  [Stoltenberg] Yes. No peace efforts can solve everything, 
however. For a long time we have been failing to find a 
solution without imposing an ultimatum. We have nine 
theoretical models here, which look different in the field and 
different when you view them from a negotiating table. They 
cannot be implemented without an agreement between the parties 
at war. We cannot force people to live together. Look at the 
Middle East. Despite the treaties that have been concluded, the 
situation still depends on whether certain people are able to 
live together. 
  [Stoltenberg] Does the Geneva Peace Plan of the European 
Union have any importance after the agreement has been signed in 
Washington? 
  [Palata] The Washington agreement is a basis for fulfilling 
the action plan. When you look simultaneously at the plan and 
at the agreement concluded in the U.S. capital you will see that 
they are based on the same principle. Moreover, the European 
Union has participated actively in drafting the Muslim-Croatian 
treaty.

  [Excerpts] Skopje, March 14 (AFP) -- Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Monday welcomed plans 
by the United States to send additional U.S. troops to the 
former Yugoslav republic to allow Scandinavian troops to be 
redeployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Defence Minister Vlado 
Popovski said on national radio: "If the (United Nations) 
Security Council approves an increase in the number of American 
peacekeepers or a replacement of the Nordic battalion, Macedonia 
will respond positively to that decision." Stressing the 
Scandinavian troops had done a "highly professional" job, 
Popovski added that he believed their replacement by U.S. forces 
would send "a warning to possible aggressors" against Macedonia. 
The minister added: "The work of the Nordic battalion on the 
northern border (with Serbia) has already led to a decrease in 
tensions and ensured a degree of stability in the region." 
[passage omitted] 
  Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have a total of 800 
troops in Macedonia.

<F P=106> [Emilija Geleva commentary: "Greek Embargo or a `Military </F>
Act'?"] 
  [Text] Washington, March -- During the past few weeks U.S. 
President Bill Clinton has made several important foreign 
political decisions: the recognition of the Republic of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], 
the resolute action for stopping the war violence in Bosnia, the 
Bosnian-Croat agreement, nonetheless he did not leave out the 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which became critical after 
the massacre in Hebron. In the meantime, he continued with his 
pressure over Japan because of the large U.S. trade deficit and 
opened North Korea's doors for the international inspection of 
nuclear plants. 
  Therefore, it is no wonder that the majority of Americans 
are 
concerned about the President's foreign policy, and our people, 
on their side, are worried about Macedonia's position in all 
that, aware that the events in the Balkans are far from a happy 
ending. Namely, after Greece's latest blockade, it looks as if 
Greece is once again in the offensive in relation to the 
Republic of Macedonia, although the West strongly condemned this 
act. 
  While the majority of Americans seem to be mainly content 
with the way Clinton is conducting the foreign policy, the 
majority of foreign political experts, diplomats, and observers, 
criticize it for lack of concept, for insecurity of power, for 
naivete, and for delayed foreign political decisionmaking. What 
is U.S. policy in the Balkans, naive or thoughtful, timely or 
tedious? 
  Many of those following the events in the Balkans, experts 
and journalists, have for some time warned about the increased 
danger of the war spreading to the south. Some reporters go so 
far, for instance the one from the BBC, who explained to his 
viewers the reason why he left Sarajevo and moved to Skopje from 
Sarajevo, saying he was now waiting for the war to start in 
Macedonia. After such statements we cannot but ask ourselves 
whether it is the journalists who sometimes create events in 
order to make exclusive reports. Talking about sensitive zones 
such as ours, or as was in the Gulf, it is known in Washington 
that sometimes even the U.S. State Department is informed of 
journalists' reports. Therefore, it is possible to push the 
events violently and create an image that is totally opposite to 
reality. Although many such events, terrifying for us, are 
based on the exclusivity of some journalists at any cost, one 
should not underestimate the persistent warnings of some experts 
about spreading the war. However, they are wrong in one thing, 
in their claims that the war is threatening from the north, 
totally leaving out Greece, whose present act of a full embargo 
against Macedonia represents the greatest war threat. 
  The U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, at the 
so-called interrogation in the Congress Subcommittee for outside 
operations on 1 March, said: "As far as Macedonia is concerned, 
we have a strong feeling for maintaining the territorial 
integrity of that country. We have 300 soldiers there and we 
urged all the countries in the region to be concerned about 
Macedonia. I think its future is of importance for the United 
States," Christopher emphasized and also added: "We put it 
clearly to Serbia that if they harmed the independence of 
Macedonia in any way, it would generate a sound reaction from 
the United States." This stance was the answer to the question 
of Congressman Allver, who asked the secretary of state to 
explain why Macedonia was not mentioned on page six of his 
statement, where it said that the United States was directing 
its efforts to the south, to Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania. 
According to the aforementioned explanation given by Warren 
Christopher, it seems that the document was prepared preceding 
the recognition of the Republic of Macedonia, and it is totally 
clear that the United States attaches extreme importance to 
Macedonia on its list. 
  According to some State Department announcements the 
situation is cautiously monitored and, if necessary, they are 
ready to react, which is nothing new, if we recall that last May 
the Pentagon announced that, in case of a threat to Macedonia, 
U.S. planes will directly attack Belgrade. Nevertheless, 
despite such mental acrobatics, there still remains the question 
of how real the danger for Macedonia from Serbia is, and whether 
the threat from Greece is not greater. In other words, as a 
U.S. colleague said, trying to explain the Greek act, when Egypt 
blocked the Suez Canal in 1967 for Tehran, it was considered to 
be a war act. Therefore, if there actually is a threat to peace 
in the south of the Balkans, like he said, it certainly is 
because of the Greek chauvinism. 
  The U.S. Administration has, in this context, admonished the 
Greek act and this was explicitly stated to the Greek ambassador 
in Washington, Tsilas, at his meeting with the deputy Secretary 
of State Oxman and Tarrioff [name as transliterated]. Despite 
all that, the embargo has been carried out for more than three 
weeks. Therefore, instead of forcing the threat of a war 
situation from the north, it might be preferable if the West, 
and even the United States, were more direct toward Greece, 
because it is not only Serbia's best ally, but with the present 
embargo against Macedonia, it is clearly generating damage that 
can push it and the Balkans into an abyss. For the United 
States there is no dilemma that it would be fatal for the region 
and that it would provoke conflict within NATO. 
  The West should ultimately bring its "spoiled child" to its 
senses and explain to it that there is no more cold war. That 
is why Greece can no longer write history as it suits it, and 
claim that Macedonia is an artificial product, forgetting that 
it was thanks to the interests of the big powers that it once 
got a part of Macedonia, guaranteed to it with all possible 
international acts, to which Macedonia has added and continues 
to offer additional guarantees. Greece should at last stop its 
hostile propaganda against the Republic of Macedonia, stop 
claiming that the Macedonian people does not exist, and of 
course, it should stop interfering in internal affairs by 
putting forward thousands of conditions. Only the West can 
awaken it from that dream, before the dream turns into a coma. 
  Macedonia is not only in the U.S. zone of interest, but also 
in the Russian, because Russia will not cede the full world's 
leadership to the United States, especially after it apparently 
stood on the side of Serbia in the Bosnian war, which implies 
that its position in the Macedonian-Greek dialogue would be more 
significant.

<F P=106> [Article by Miroljub Zaric] </F>
  [Excerpts] Skopje, March 14 (TANJUG) -- Failure of the last 
week's efforts by U.N. official Cyrus Vance to mediate in a 
dispute between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia (FYRM) [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM] has confirmed that, for the time being, neither Athens 
nor Skopje have any intentions of changing their stands. Greece 
strongly opposes that FYRM, which seceded from the former 
Yugoslav Federation in 1991, should be recognized under the name 
of Macedonia, arguing that the name is related to the Greek 
history and that it shows Skopje's territorial claims on the 
Greek province of the same name. When some member-countries of 
the European Union (E.U.), despite Greek resistance (Greece is 
also a E.U. member) in late 1993 recognized FYRM and established 
diplomatic relations with it, Athens imposed a trade embargo on 
FYRM. 
  Regardless of the damage caused by the Greek blockade, which 
adds to almost three billion dollars of FYRM's loss caused by 
its abiding by U.N. anti-Yugoslav sanctions, FYRM's leadership 
is not prepared to make concessions and compromises, primarily 
because of the parliamentary and presidential elections 
scheduled for November. Three of the four members of the ruling 
coalition -- Macedonia's Social-Democrats, Liberals and 
Socialists -- fear that their yielding in this dispute would 
make the opposition call them "traitors of national interests." 
The fourth coalition partner (the Party for Democratic 
Prosperity) which rallies ethnic Albanians, fears that FYRM 
might take a name which would point at the Slav features of the 
nation living in it, thus undermining the party's assertion that 
"the Albanians represent an autochthonous nation in the 
territory." 
  Ethnic Albanian parties in FYRM urge the authorities in 
Skopje to recognize the status of the Albanian national minority 
in FYRM as that of a nation. They want to proclaim territorial 
and political autonomy in western Macedonia, where the Albanian 
population represents the majority. Political analysts in Skopje 
assess that the Greek-Macedonian dialogue will yield no results 
before the elections are completed and the new government 
established in FYRM, meaning, according to their predictions, 
that the current state of affairs would be frozen for at least 
one year's time. [passage omitted] 
  Such moves, according to observers, aggravate the already 
bad 
Greek-Macedonian relations and justify the claims of the circles 
in Athens that authorities in Skopje have "territorial claims on 
Greece."

  [Text] We have a report that there are about 600 people in 
front of the Primate Palace [in Primate Square, Bratislava]] 
today. 
  My colleagues from Radio Free Europe and I estimate that 
there were over 1,000 people there at the time I left the 
Primate Palace, shortly before 1730. I shall read out an agency 
report, and then I will tell you my own experience: 
  The crowd of about 600 demonstrators in front of the 
presidential palace in the center of Bratislava, a TA SR report 
says, who are demanding the resignation of the head of state, 
today beat up two journalists from the U.S. radio station Radio 
Free Europe: Stefan Hrib was kicked to the ground and had his 
jacket and briefcase with all of his documents stolen. 
  A CTK reporter has said that the second person attacked was 
Milan Zitny, a member of the Czech section of Radio Free Europe 
in Slovakia. He went on to say that there was no policeman in 
the vicinity, and when Stefan Hrib found a police car, the 
police refused to take him to the police station. Milan Zitny 
was punched and kicked at the other end of Primate Square, where 
a demonstration was taking place. Milan Zitny said: The police 
tried to defend me, but the people were furious and they were in 
the majority. The aggressive demonstrators broke his camera. 
Then the police took him away in their car. According to Milan 
Zitny, he did not require treatment. 
  This is all from the TA SR report. I should like to add 
that, when Zitny was being insulted and screams were heard, 
Ljuba Lesna, my Radio Free Europe colleague, and I went to find 
out what was happening in Primate Square. During the meeting, 
the crowd, the aggressiveness of the people gathered there, for 
the most part older people of pensionable age, turned against 
us. Ljuba Lesna was physically attacked, and I got a slap in 
the face, but the policeman who was standing beside me, whom I 
asked for help, said: I am not here.

  [Excerpts] Representatives of the opposition parties that, 
in fact, represent the coalition already, together with Jozef 
Moravcik and Roman Kovac, returned from the talks with the 
president of the Republic shortly before 2200. He announced to 
the president the name of the candidate who is to form the new 
government. Our reporters have just returned from the 
parliament building. Hence, we can offer you the following 
interviews. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified official] The parties that 
formed the opposition so far, presented [the president] with the 
name of a new prime minister to be authorized to form the new 
Slovak government. This proposed prime minister, approved by 
the president as well, is Jozef Moravcik. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Did the opposition parties 
propose candidates for ministerial posts as well? 
  [Official] This was not the topic of the talks. According to 
the information given by the hitherto opposition parties, the 
names for individual posts are more or less known [to the 
opposition parties]. However, this [list of names] will be 
fine-tuned. There is a chance that the names for individual 
ministerial posts will be announced by Wednesday [16 March]. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified official] The Party of the Democratic Left 
will 
propose seven names [for ministerial posts]. The Center Bloc, 
as I called it this afternoon--i.e., the Alliance of Democrats, 
the National Democratic Club, and another independent club, 
headed by Mr. Bajan--will also present seven names. The 
Christian Democratic Movement will present five names. 
  [Correspondent] How many deputy prime ministers will there 
be? 
  [Unidentified official] It is expected that there will be 
three deputy prime ministers. One deputy prime minister will be 
in charge of the economy. There will be another deputy prime 
minister for the so-called superstructure or ministries of the 
nonproductive sphere, and a deputy prime minister for 
legislative matters. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chief Editor Jan Smolec: "My Word About the </F>
Slovak President"] 
  [Text] When writing an article about the Slovak president, 
I have the advantage, compared with some other journalists, of 
having spoken and written about Slovak statehood and the post of 
Slovak president even during the days of the rigid federation. 
At that time, today's fighters for democracy did not even 
mention Slovak statehood, let alone the Slovak presidency. Even 
my friend Jozef Sitko, currently chief of the president's press 
section, once called speculation about a Slovak state and the 
post of Slovak president extremely nationalistic. 
  I reminded Mr. Michal Kovac of this immediately after his 
election as president, at his meeting with nationally oriented 
journalists. To make matters clear right from the start, I 
supported Michal Kovac's candidacy for the presidency both as 
journalist and as deputy to the former CSFR Federal Assembly, 
particularly in view of his contribution, as chairman of the 
Federal Assembly, to the civilized and constitutional partition 
of the Czechoslovak state. 
  The sort of people with whom the president surrounded 
himself 
after his election came as a shock to me, however. Some people 
from his circle were active opponents of Slovak statehood. The 
president repeats in a stereotyped way that he wants to be 
everyone's president. Although this sounds nice, many of us are 
asking whether he also wants to be the president of those who 
had fought for an independent Slovakia. 
  All kinds of Czechoslovakist and anti-Slovak cadres have 
entrenched themselves at the Castle [seat of the Slovak 
president]. One of them is Alojz Rajnic, deputy to the former 
Federal Assembly for the Christian Democratic Movement. In the 
Office of the President, he was in charge of the Slovak state's 
security policy. What were his qualifications for this post? 
While a Federal Assembly deputy, he had voted against an 
independent Slovak state. A few days ago, I learned that he was 
leaving the Castle at long last. He is leaving to assume the 
post of chief of an outlying branch of the Presidential Office 
that is being set up in Kosice. 
  During our last meeting, I conveyed to the president these 
objections in person. I was extremely perturbed by the fact 
that a certain aversion to Prime Minister Meciar, verging on 
hatred, had taken possession of him. He told me briefly what he 
also said in the National Council of the Slovak Republic the day 
before yesterday. I conceded that Meciar was making mistakes, 
also with regard to diplomatic restraint. What cannot be 
ignored, however, is the credit he deserves for the founding of 
the state and the enormous endeavor he is devoting to the 
elimination of the transformation pangs and the building of 
Slovak statehood. In no way has he ever violated the 
Constitution, the law, or the principles of democracy, freedom, 
and pluralism. The Meciar phenomenon is stirring Slovakia; the 
young state needs both Michal Kovac and Vladimir Meciar, I wrote 
after that meeting. I hoped that they would make their peace 
with one another. After all, in the Czech Republic, too, there 
are disagreements between the president and the prime minister, 
but no one is making a fuss about it. 
  Unfortunately, the Slovak president has turned the 
misunderstandings between the Castle and the government into a 
confrontational drama. Like a telltale, he complained to the 
world that the prime minister did not come to welcome him at the 
airport. 
  The president has become too absorbed in himself. It is as 
though he did not want to take into consideration certain 
historical connections. For example, he accepts without any 
reservations the title of first Slovak president. "The 
president's Slovaks" (they bear the emblem of the president's 
banner) do not protest and do not emphasize that Michal Kovac is 
the second Slovak president. The first president was Dr. Jozef 
Tiso, irrespective of his evaluation by history. The Slovak 
nation can excuse all kinds of things, but the sight of Michal 
Kovac with headphones on, listening to a Hungarian-Slovak 
translation at the congress of the Hungarian Christian 
Democratic Movement, was an insult to the stately post of Slovak 
president. 
  The people were looking forward to the Slovak president's 
speech [in parliament on 9 March]; they expected it to be 
conciliatory, calming, and supremely statesmanlike. What they 
heard, however, were tones of confrontation that open the doors 
to the Balkanization of our life. 
  Unfortunately, these are the traces that the second Slovak 
president is leaving behind him. He has somehow forgotten who 
supported him, nominated him, and elected him. Under the 
influence of his advisers, he has staked on a risky card. He 
has not even noticed that he is cheered mostly by those who did 
not want an independent Slovakia.

  [Excerpts] The analysis of the current political situation 
and preparations of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
[HZDS] for parliamentary and communal elections were the main 
points of today's meeting of the National Presidium of the HZDS 
in Spisska Nova Ves. More from Pavol Sveton: 
  [Begin recording] [Sveton] [passage omitted] We have learned 
from the press secretary, in the course of the HZDS National 
Presidium discussions, that Vladimir Meciar has offered his 
resignation from the position of chairman of the HZDS, this 
being based on yesterday's developments in the parliament. 
However, members of the presidium have expressed their full 
confidence in him. At the following press debate, Vladimir 
Meciar, among other things, said: 
  [Meciar] The movement has confirmed that it is entering into 
opposition and will not enter into any government coalition that 
is now being formed. The movement is dissatisfied with the 
president's activities, with the method he has of carrying out 
his duties, and with the way he has damaged the interests of the 
state and the good name of the Slovak Government. At the same 
time, the movement expresses its concern about the internal 
situation, among the citizens and elsewhere in that the stage is 
becoming more fragmented rather than consolidated. Can you 
imagine the big fight that is about to start, for example, in 
connection with who will propose the prime minister? Peter 
Weiss [chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL)] 
thinks it will be him and forgot to notice that, behind his 
back, a coalition was formed of Milan Knazko [chairman of the 
Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic], Ludovit Cernak 
[former chairman of the Slovak National Party], and Jan 
Carnogursky [chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement], 
which has gotten more votes than Weiss. Problems are arising in 
the personnel situation. 
  In any case, the movement recommends and the government 
wants 
to apply this recommendation that, after my resignation on 14 
March, the whole government will resign. We do not recommend 
that members of the government accept the president's request to 
continue exercising their duties. The president grossly 
offended members of this government by accusing them of 
corruption. This has spread throughout the world today. He 
cannot ask that these people who were so grossly accused and 
offended accept such appointments. He alone must bear the 
responsibility and consequences. [passage omitted]. 
  Concerning negotiations with other political parties, the 
HZDS is of the opinion that the leadership of the SDL, 
particularly Weiss and Milan Ftacnik [deputy chairman of the 
SDL], is untrustworthy. It broke all agreements that were 
prepared for this action. It will take a very long time for the 
trust of our parties and movements to return for a resumption of 
mutual negotiations, and there is a big question mark over its 
ever becoming possible. 
  I will return to the parliament together with Olga 
Keltosova, 
minister of labor, social affairs, and the family, and Justice 
Minister Katarina Tothova. We shall use all of our capabilities 
to become a strong opposition party. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the </F>
Democratic Left, by correspondent Ivan Samel; place and date not 
given--live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Samel] Can we already talk about some partial 
results? 
  [Weiss] Of course, because these negotiations did not begin 
just last week. There will be another meeting of opposition 
representatives this afternoon, and a decision should be reached 
then about the most fundamental personnel questions. 
  [Samel] Some time ago, a demand was made that party chairmen 
should not be included in this government. Can you tell us if 
they are going to be in the government? 
  [Weiss] I am of the opinion that this demand should be 
respected. After all, we made it recently. [passage omitted] 
  [Samel] The present opposition parties are presenting the 
new 
government as a good alternative at this time. However, there 
are voices casting doubts on the efficiency of such government 
in view of the fact that there would be too many parties 
participating with too diverse an orientation. Judging by the 
atmosphere at the talks, can you say that this government would 
not be problem and conflict ridden? 
  [Weiss] This government is going to be interested in 
agreeing 
on basic policy priorities, on things that need to be solved 
first of all within a given time. Of course, it will be a 
government that is going to be aware of its responsibility to 
the Slovak Republic and its citizens. It will certainly not be 
an anti-Slovak government that some people are trying to 
suggest. It will simply be an alternative to that type of rule 
that we have just lived through. This government will invest in 
expertise, will resolutely press ahead with the transformation 
of the state economy, and will try to act competently. It will 
definitely tell people the truth about the state of the economy, 
even if it is bitter. 
  The citizen does not need to be lied to because he can 
become 
optimistic only if such optimism is warranted and based on a 
true picture of the state of the national economy and its 
potential. We do not want a government that just keeps things 
going, but one that will create genuine conditions for the 
continuation of the transformation process after the early 
elections, and for businesslike solutions to a multitude of 
problems weighing down on people. Apart from economic and 
social problems, this government will make it its priority to 
deal with growing criminality. 
  [Samel] What economic measures can be expected from the new 
government? 
  [Weiss] The government wants to set off on a course of 
pursuing a realistic policy of macroeconomic transformation. As 
I have already said, the platform will be an analysis of the 
state of the economy, especially so that the government is able 
to send a clear signal to the public about the conditions under 
which it is taking over the economy, and what the reasons for 
this situation are. 
  The government will undoubtedly cooperate with the banking 
and capital market to find an immediate solution to corporate 
insolvencies, including bankruptcies, reviving the flow of 
money, and developing the capital market. Work on amending the 
law on the state budget will definitely begin so as to put its 
revenue and expenditure on a more realistic basis. 
  The government will strive to maintain external balance [as 
heard]. Through its economic policy, it wants to sustain the 
internal convertibility of the currency. Its political 
decisions will not interfere with currency stability. Above 
all, exchange rates will not be artificially sustained at the 
cost of increasing foreign indebtedness. Measures aimed at 
protecting the domestic market will be implemented in compliance 
with international agreements. 
  Another important aspect of the government's work will be to 
depoliticize privatization in accordance with the adopted 
amendment to the law on big privatization. Special emphasis 
will be placed on the equality of [privatization] methods, on 
the equal standing of those who enter into privatization 
process, on transparency, and on exercising parliamentary and 
public control over privatization. 
  The government will try to begin preparation of the second 
wave of coupon privatization, so that it might begin in the 
second half of 1994. 
  It is natural that the government that takes over 
responsibility will be exposed to a huge number of risks, and 
the time it will have at its disposal will not be sufficient. 
But transformation must be continued, and, at the same time, 
the most pressing difficulties hampering people's lives must be 
pragmatically resolved. 
  Wherever possible, the new government will try to compensate 
for the impact of certain economic measures on the population by 
introducing positive measures in other spheres--for example, in 
the social sphere or in reducing criminality. 
  [Samel] The law on reducing the [parliamentary] term of the 
office is due to be adopted in the near future. But for this 
you will need the votes of the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak National Party [SNS]. Have there 
been any parallel talks with these deputies' groups? 
  [Weiss] Yes, talks did take place. All of them want to call 
early elections. I hope that we will crack this problem on 
Wednesday [16 March, when the Slovak Parliament is due to resume 
its session]. It would a very good thing if the government had 
a clear mandate for its work. 
  [Samel] Have you had any indications that some deputies from 
the HZDS and the SNS will be willing to vote for the elections 
to be held at the end of September or the beginning of October? 
  [Weiss] There are, of course, some indications, but we 
should 
wait until this important hurdle is overcome.

Introduce Visas for Citizens of Slovakia"] 
  [Excerpt] The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] will 
introduce a visa requirement for citizens of the Slovak Republic 
with effect from 17 May 1994. As we learned from the FRY 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this is a reciprocal measure of the 
Yugoslav side, which comes in response to the recent 
cancellation by the Slovak Government of the bilateral treaty on 
the abolition of visas. 
  The decision by the government in Bratislava, made about 20 
days ago, did not specify when the new visa regime would be 
introduced. However, it transpires from information we obtained 
at the FRY Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Yugoslavs who travel 
to Slovakia after 17 May will have to furnish their travel 
documents with a Slovak visa. The explanation granted to the 
PRAVDA correspondent at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 
Belgrade states that the Slovak Government's decision "is an 
expression of its assessment and needs, the causes and motives 
of which we do not wish to analyze. However, for objective 
reasons, this act of the Slovak side definitely does not 
contribute to the bilateral wish to further expand relations 
between the two countries' citizens." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [CTK report: "PRACA: Operation of KGB Agents in Slovakia </F>
Being Legalized Again"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The operation of KGB members in Slovakia 
is being legalized again, which runs counter to the country's 
declared orientation, writes yesterday's issue of the daily 
PRACA in a commentary on the recent visit to Bratislava by 
Yevgeniy Primakov, chief of the Russian Foreign Intelligence 
Service. 
  According to the paper, the Slovak Information Service (SIS) 
did not offer jobs to former members of the Federal Security and 
Information Service [FIS] who had undergone training in Western 
intelligence services but, quite the contrary, has employed 
several former State Security Corps [communist-era secret 
service] members. 
  Because of the operation of a permanent Russian intelligence 
adviser with the SIS, the Slovak secret service disqualifies 
itself from close cooperation with the secret services of 
Western countries and reduces this cooperation to the mere 
exchange of essential information. The new Russian Foreign 
Intelligence Service, which is a direct successor to the First 
KGB Administration, is identical to its predecessor in terms of 
staff, the paper writes, adding that "SIS members will be 
dealing with essentially the same people as under Brezhnev." In 
this context, the daily draws attention to the fact that the 
seizure of power by the communists and the enforcement of 
Moscow's will in the former socialist countries after World War 
II had also been anticipated by agents and advisers of the 
former NKVD [People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs, 
predecessor of the KGB] occupying the ministries of interior and 
the secret services. 
  According to Yevgeniy Primakov, chief of the Russian Foreign 
Intelligence Service, and his Slovak interlocutors, cooperation 
between the two services will be geared mainly toward the 
struggle against terrorist and drug mafias. The daily points 
out, however, that the Law on the Russian Federation Foreign 
Intelligence Service does not provide for such activity. 
"Rather, this is a matter for counterintelligence," PRACA adds.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Tomanek: "Three Research Institutes and Six </F>
Enterprises Have Been Privatized"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava--Following yesterday's 86th Session 
of the Slovak Government, there can be no doubt that 
privatization is picking up pace. The Cabinet yesterday 
discussed and approved nine privatization projects. A report on 
establishing a City University in Kralovsky Chlmec and a draft 
law on certain measures concerning state supervision of security 
work were withdrawn from the agenda. Material on the Foundation 
for the Development of the Regions in the Slovak Republic 
suffered the same fate. Moreover, three documents--a draft law 
that alters and supplements the law on income tax and two draft 
privatization projects--came onto the agenda. 
<H5>  Approved </H5>
  The following documents were among those approved at 
yesterday's government session: a draft law on conducting 
business; a report on the fulfillment of the Slovak Government's 
policy in the struggle against crime, including its prevention; 
a report on the activity of the joint Slovak-Czech Border 
Commission; a proposal on the appointment of the members of the 
Slovak Forestry Commission Preparatory Committee; and an 
analysis of the current situation with regard to the upbringing 
and education of physically handicapped children and young 
people. 
  The government also approved other important materials 
yesterday, including an addendum to the proposal on providing 
guarantees from the state budget for credit from a foreign bank 
for the North Slovak Pulp and Paper Mills, a report on the 
disposal of radioactive waste, and a draft agreement between the 
Slovak Government and the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark 
on succession to bilateral agreements. The government also 
approved a proposal to conclude an agreement between the Slovak 
Government and the Russian Federation Government on cooperation 
in culture, education, and science. 
<H5>  Into Private Hands </H5>
  The government approved nine privatization projects 
yesterday: the Trnava Nuclear Power Plants Research Institute; 
DATA-STAV Presov; the Bratislava Research Institute for 
Engineering Projects; Stavex Humenne; CHEMVAP Kosice, an 
enterprise providing services for cement plants and lime works; 
the Bratislava Institute for the Economy and Organization of the 
Construction Industry; the Lucenec Civil Engineering Works; the 
Humenne Meat Industry plant; and Vino Kosice. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  The Popularity Stakes </H5>
  Slovak Statistical Office Chairman R. Krc gave a report on 
the trends in support for politicians and parties. At the 
beginning of February, respondents placed most trust in Prime 
Minister Meciar. President M. Kovac came next. The Movement for 
a Democratic Slovakia was the most popular party. On the other 
hand, the Democratic Party-Conservative Democratic Party and the 
Social Democratic Party of Slovakia were among the parties whose 
support declined to below 2.0 percent. Surprisingly, the number 
of citizens who reject the screening law has declined.

  [Text] Bratislava--Vladimir Masar, governor of the Slovak 
National Bank [NBS], yesterday informed the highest 
representatives of all commercial banks about topical issues of 
monetary development and the NBS's monetary policy. The meeting 
was attended by other members of the NBS Banking Council. The 
discussion concerned, above all, the temporary suspension by the 
NBS of refinancing credits for commercial banks. This measure 
is a consequence of the growth of liquidity at the beginning of 
this year, caused by the increase of the state budget deficit 
toward the end of 1993. The representatives of commercial banks 
noted that, even though they were not responsible for the growth 
of liquidity, this NBS measure has an unfavorable impact on 
their credit policy toward clients.

<F P=106> [Article by "st": "We Produce Less but Bankers and Insurance </F>
Agents Are Satisfied; The Slovak Economy in Light of Statistics"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--According to Slovak Statistical Office 
data, gross domestic product dropped 4.1 percent last year, 
compared with 1992. In current prices, it reached a value of 
336.7 billion korunas [Sk], which was 11.6 percent more than the 
year before. Completed investments reached a value of almost 
Sk102 billion, which represents a 10-percent increase in nominal 
terms but a 6 percent drop when price growth is taken into 
consideration. 
  Slovakia exported Sk167.2 billion worth of goods last year, 
with the largest volume of exports going to the Czech Republic 
[CR]. Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Russia follow at some 
distance. At the same time, exports to the CR dropped more than 
11 percent [compared with 1992]. The greatest volumes of goods 
to Slovakia were imported from the CR, Russia, Germany, and 
Austria. The surplus of imports over exports is reflected in a 
balance-of-trade deficit of Sk26.7 billion. A surplus of Sk1.3 
billion was achieved in the trade balance with the CR. 
  An average of 1,924,900 people were working in the national 
economy last year, 3.2 percent less than the year before. The 
level of employment declined throughout the year, with the 
exception of the second quarter. The level of employment in 
enterprises in private ownership, including cooperatives, 
increased 0.9 percent. The steepest decline in employment was 
recorded in the sphere of material production. It was offset by 
higher employment in banking and services. 
  The average nominal monthly wages per employee in the 
national economy reached Sk5,372 last year, which represents an 
increase of 18.5 percent. Real wages declined 3.5 percent, 
however, compared with 1992. The most rapid increase in average 
monthly wages, by 30.4 percent, was in small enterprises with up 
to 24 employees, where they reached Sk6,675. Average earnings 
in enterprises with 25 or more employees increased more than 20 
percent, to Sk5,364. The highest level of average monthly 
salaries, Sk10,386, was reached in banking and the insurance 
business. This represents an increase of 36.6 percent. Monthly 
earnings in the production and distribution of electricity, gas, 
and water averaged Sk7,767 (an increase of 30.9 percent), and in 
the extraction of raw materials Sk6,482 (an increase of 21.8 
percent). Average monthly salaries in budget-funded and 
subsidized organizations of a nonentrepreneurial nature 
increased 10.3 percent, to Sk5,035. The wages of employees in 
privately owned businesses are estimated to have increased by 
18.2 percent, to Sk5,850. 
  The greatest profit was made last year in the production and 
distribution of electricity, gas, and water. The greatest 
losses were suffered in agriculture, gamekeeping, forestry, 
retailing, and in repairs of motor vehicles and consumer goods. 
Of 4,148 enterprises, 1,763 ended the year with a profit. The 
aggregate profit of these firms amounted to Sk68.4 billion, 
while loss-making enterprises generated an aggregate loss of 
Sk42.6 billion. The liabilities of Slovak enterprises increased 
by Sk36.5 billion last year, to Sk373.2 billion. 
  Small enterprises [with under 25 employees] accounted for 
only 8 percent of total industrial output and for 9.8 percent of 
building industry output. Small enterprises, including private 
businessmen, asserted themselves most markedly in retailing, 
where they accounted for 68.8 percent of total turnover. Small 
enterprises developed dynamically, in particular, in freight 
road transport. Compared with 1992, their performance went up 
168.3 percent, while in industry it went up 74.2 percent, in the 
building industry 55.4 percent, and in retailing 50.7 percent. 
  The Slovak Republic had a population of 5,330,000 at the end 
of last year, 51.2 percent of which were women. The annual 
population growth reached 0.4 percent. Some 8,900 persons 
migrated to Slovakia, while 7,200 persons emigrated. A total of 
379,170 job seekers were registered with labor offices at the 
end of January 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by "(mad)": "Burglars Are in First Place"] </F>
  [Text] Bratislava--Thirteen murders, 10 of which have been 
resolved--that is, a 77-percent success rate--200 robberies, of 
which the police have clarified almost 39 percent, and 20 rapes, 
15 of which have been cleared up, are a sample of the crime 
figures for Slovakia since the beginning of this year. This 
information was made available yesterday by Jaroslav Ivor, 
director of the Slovak Police Force Office of Investigations, 
and his colleagues. 
  It is apparent from the overall crime rate that theft by 
burglary is the crime committed most in Slovakia. The 7,778 
incidents during the first two months of this year, just under 
19 percent of which have been cleared up by the police, testify 
to the growing audacity of the burglars and to the impotence of 
the police, who, despite considerable effort, are unable at the 
moment to confront this menace. The overall damage inflicted 
has increased by more than 30 percent, compared with the first 
two months of last year, and it can definitely be said that the 
victims themselves are partly to blame for the burglars' 
success, because, from the point of view of the police 
investigator, they obviously sometimes invite the criminal 
directly into their homes. 
<H5>  Embezzlers of the State </H5>
  So-called economic crime, or criminal activity against state 
property, holds a steady place in the shocking statistics on the 
crime rate. To date, the "mere" 13 instances of crime committed 
against privatization could testify to a relative lack of 
interest by pseudobusinessmen in this sphere. The opposite is 
true, however. The almost 25 million korunas [Sk] worth of 
damage resulting from crime against state property and the 43 
cases of tax evasion, which amounts to almost Sk283 million, 
again reveal major flaws in legislation, which is a problem for 
National Council of the Slovak Republic deputies. Fraudulent 
purchases of goods on a noncash basis have inflicted damage on 
our economy of more than Sk20 million, and we could continue in 
this vein ad infinitum because the embezzlers' resourcefulness 
is limitless. The overall damage from property and economic 
crime during the first two months of this year alone amounts to 
more than Sk300 million! 
<H5>  Money Forgers </H5>
  Those who forge money and bonds are also among the criminals 
with good prospects. Some 531 instances of forged domestic and 
foreign currencies, 162 instances of franked Slovak bank notes 
(including five cases where the new Slovak currency has been 
forged), and forged U.S. dollars, British pounds, Austrian 
schillings, and other currencies bear witness to the lucrative 
development of the crime rate under our conditions. The fact 
that children are among the delinquents is particularly 
cautionary. The more than 4,600 instances of crime committed by 
children reveal that the most basic element of society, the 
family, is also breaking down! 
  It is interesting to note that criminal activity by Romanies 
has shown a relative decline. This, however, really only is in 
relative terms because Romanies are involved in almost 22 
percent of crimes committed. Repeat offenders have also shown a 
relative decline in the Slovak Republic; "only" 13,907 have been 
prosecuted, which is the same as in the past three years. 
<H5>  Something Slovakia Still Does Not Need </H5>
  We cite, as a gem, a report issued by the Czech Press 
Agency, 
according to which special units have even been established 
there to deal with extremist groups, skinheads, neofascists, and 
so on. This is something that so far we do not need in 
Slovakia....

<F P=106> [Article by Snezana Beric: "Mandator Will Be Discussed at </F>
the Next Meeting of the Parliament"] 
  [Text] Borovo Selo, 9 Mar -- "I shall try once more to 
reach an agreement with both the coalition and other leaders of 
the parliamentary parties, in order to find a solution for a new 
mandator in the government of the republic of Serbian Krajina 
[RSK]. I shall not give up my intention to find a man who is a 
successful businessman, capable of organizing things well, who 
works 24 hours a day, and to whom the doors of both the FRY 
[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] and the Srpska republic are 
wide open. 
  "I already have an idea who that man could be, but I am not 
going to name him, not yet. But the problem is that he will 
hardly pass, given such a constellation of forces in the 
assembly. At the next meeting of the assembly I shall officially 
put him in for the mandator. The coalition in Krajina's assembly 
is pushing Milan Babic for the mandator, but he does not meet 
any of the criteria for that position, and I shall not accept 
that at any price." Milan Martic, president of the RSK, stated 
this to POLITIKA yesterday. 
<H5>  Subversive Behavior of Coalition </H5>
  Yesterday President Martic visited first the community of 
Mirkovci and the oil industries of Krajina, and then in Borovo 
Selo he held a working meeting with the representatives of the 
communities of Slavonia, Baranja, and western Srem, as well as 
with the representatives of the Serbian army of Krajina and the 
police. As Martic informed us, the collective conclusion made by 
all the participants was that local interests must not be placed 
ahead of state interests, since Krajina is defended by defending 
each of its regions, so it is necessary to make the things work 
in such a way that, in the case of aggression in one of 
Krajina's regions, the military potentials in other parts are 
automatically activated. 
  "We have to understand that none of the communities is 
capable of being a state for itself, and defending itself 
alone," Martic says. 
  The president of Krajina spoke most about the recent events 
with regard to the election of the mandator of the Krajina 
government, and with regard to trends in the Krajina assembly. 
According to Martic, the artificially formed coalition in the 
Krajina assembly is doing a great harm to the state, while 
certain individuals are trying to get to power because of their 
own interests and revanchism toward Serbia, and given such 
goals, they want to make a weapon out of the people and use it 
against Serbia. "In the Krajina assembly that coalition is 
violating the constitutional principles, the assembly's boards 
want to exert the pressure on the government, strip it of its 
authorizations, and start governing the country by their own 
rules. Negative consequences of such a behavior can already be 
felt in the defense system as well, since the laws have been 
urgently changed following the decisions by those boards, 
without asking the government for opinion," Martic claims. 
  "I am determined to prevent that. I am still making efforts 
to find solutions to make the coalition come to its senses, and 
to prevent placing the petty partisan and individual interests, 
particularly by some individuals from Babic's Serbian Democratic 
Party [SDS] of Krajina, ahead of the state interests. None of 
them ran in the elections with a platform promising the collapse 
of the state. The fact is that they were promising prosperity 
and the strengthening of the state, and for that reason the 
people voted for them. However, now they are behaving 
absolutely subversively. 
  "If they continue that way, I will have to use my 
constitutional and legal authorizations to prevent that. 
According to those authorizations I am allowed to dissolve the 
assembly in compliance with the requirements of the state of 
war. That is the last measure I would want to apply, but if I 
were forced to do that, I would do it. Because the way they are 
behaving in the assembly surpasses the way in which the Croatian 
Democratic Community treated the SDS in former Croatia. The 
only goal of theirs is to attain power, and to turn my role into 
one matching the role of the queen of England. What they are 
doing in the assembly is definitely the subversion of the 
state," Martic claims. 

<H5>    The Krajina Socialists Have Been Asked for Support </H5>
  "Everything that is happening in the Krajina assembly, and 
the subversive conduct by the coalition, is orchestrated by 
Babic," Martic alleges. The situation will depend on how strong 
the other parliamentary parties and independent candidates are 
to bring such subversive conduct to an end. Martic met with the 
representatives of the Serbian Party of the Socialists of 
Krajina, and asked them for help and support. 
  According to Martic, the following important task is the 
strengthening of the legal system. Martic promised that all 
those who committed wrongdoings that have weakened the economic 
power of the state, as well as other sorts of wrongdoings, will 
have to be brought to trial regardless of who they are or what 
function they are performing. As he pointed out, police 
inspectors and financial police have already started 
investigations. Martic maintains that the republic of Serbian 
Krajina has actually never seceded from Yugoslavia. "It is our 
task to establish everlasting connections with the FRY, and to 
join it as a stable state. In order for us to achieve that, the 
control of the state and of collective assets must be 
intensified. 
  "In a day or two I will issue a decree, an order on 
compulsory work in all the firms in Krajina. We shall introduce 
a slight form of centralization, in order to concentrate the 
control over all the assets in one place, and to improve the 
apportionment of those assets," Martic says. 
  According to Martic, at today's meeting, and also at a 
meeting of the Supreme Defense Council, an agreement on the 
Serbian army of Krajina has been reached. 
  "The burden of war must be equally carried by all of us, and 
for that reason we have to put an end to war profiteering. 
Therefore we need a higher degree of state control. Because of 
my ideas some people say that I want to establish a police-run 
state. That is not true. My ideas are only about having a 
greater degree of discipline, about having a slight degree of 
centralization of assets, and the introduction of discipline at 
all levels. Anarchy leads into disaster, and I am not going to 
allow that," Martic stresses.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Mate Granic, Croatian foreign </F>
minister and deputy prime minister, by announcer Elizabeta Gojan 
-- live] 
  [Text] [Gojan] Our guest in the studio is Mate Granic, 
Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister. 
Good evening. 
  [Granic] Good evening. 
  [Gojan] Minister Granic, negotiations within the 
Croat-Muslim 
transitional committee ended in Vienna late last night. You 
took part in the last two days of its work. Tell us what was 
exactly agreed. 
  [Granic] We have finally agreed on the constitution of the 
federation and we also reached a preliminary agreement on the 
confederation. Today, an agreement on the transitional period 
was agreed upon; before that a military agreement was signed. 
We agreed that both delegations should meet in Washington by 
the end of the week and sign all the agreements in the White 
House. 
  [Gojan] This will confirm what has been agreed upon. 
  [Granic] Correct. A Croatian delegation led by President 
Tudjman is expected to leave, most probably on Thursday. 
  [Gojan] The talks yesterday lasted for 14 hours. These were 
very long talks. Obviously, there were some problems. Can you 
tell us what the problems were? According to our reports, the 
Croatian standpoint was well coordinated. It was obviously the 
Muslim side that had some problems. 
  [Granic] Problems in connection with certain definitions 
arose. Each side firmly defended its standpoints. We sought 
better compromise solutions. The Bosniak side spent more time 
coordinating its views with Sarajevo than we did with Zagreb. 
  [Gojan] Tell us what the agreement to be signed by 
Presidents 
Tudjman and Izetbegovic in Washington by the end of the week 
means for the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina and for the Republic 
of Croatia? 
  [Granic] The agreement will also be signed by Mr. Zubak, the 
president of the presidency of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna. This also provides a guarantee for the equality 
and survival of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina at all 
levels, from the cantons as the basic federal units to the level 
of the federation, in judiciary, economy, and all other spheres. 
For the Republic of Croatia it means that an important 
strategic, political, and economic goal has been accomplished -- 
this represents a link with Bosnia-Herzegovina, a link with the 
Croat people, and a link with the Bosniak-Croat Federation. 
  [Gojan] Everyone agrees that the third warring party in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Bosnian Serbs, should, necessarily, be 
involved as soon as possible. Have you outlined any strategy? 
  [Granic] We talked, of course, about this. We agreed today 
that the transitional committee -- which negotiated both in 
Washington and in Vienna -- would negotiate with the third 
party. We also agreed on a strategy for the negotiations. These 
negotiations will probably start following the signing of the 
agreement in Washington. 
  [Gojan] According to Ambassador Redman, the future 
federation 
of the Muslims and Croats of Bosnia-Herzegovina is expected to 
have about 51 percent of territory -- something that has been 
denied by Momcilo Krajisnik, who says that 45 percent of the 
territory is enough. How can the Bosnian Serbs be forced to 
hand back these territories? 
  [Granic] At least 51 percent. Everything else is a matter of 
negotiating positions. Not only the Bosnian-Muslim side but the 
international community, too, will surely help in bringing about 
a final solution. 
  [Gojan] Tell us, do you perhaps know which areas might be at 
stake? Which side within the Federation of Croats and Muslims 
may possibly get them? 
  [Granic] This is a matter of negotiations. 
  [Gojan] When do you expect these transitional measures to 
end? Will they function well? When do you expect the federation 
will be established? 
  [Granic] Everything that was agreed in Washington has been 
implemented -- even at an earlier stage than envisaged. For 
example, the Vienna negotiations were expected to wrap up by 15 
March. They ended yesterday. Likewise, the military agreement 
was signed in time. Consequently, there is no doubt that so far 
everything has been taking place according to the agreed 
schedule against the backdrop of positive developments on the 
ground. 
  As for negotiations with the third party, there is a great 
deal of international pressure to the effect that such 
negotiations should take place as soon as possible. Right now 
we are talking about the location and organization of these 
talks. 
  [Gojan] Recently, in the media, radio, and TV, there has 
been 
a considerable degree of confusion about the possibility of the 
Bosnian Serbs being incorporated into a possible federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, including their confederal links with the 
so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Articles have been 
published here saying that this perhaps means that Croatia's 
occupied areas would possibly join Serbia. 
  [Granic] There are two certain things: Croatia will never 
want anything that resembles Yugoslavia or anything that is any 
kind of new link or whatever with Yugoslavia. By the same 
token, the UNPA's [UN Protected Areas] are Croatian territory 
under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] supervision. They are 
integral parts of Croatia. This is what we are going to discuss. 
President Tudjman will give the UN secretary general a full 
plan of our proposals for a peaceful reintegration of the UNPA's 
through a new UNPROFOR mandate. We will demand firm support 
from the United States, the European Union, and other 
international institutions.

Churkin. 
  After the talks, Churkin told journalists that appropriate 
and rapid action is needed to help the three sides in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina find the best solution. He continued: I

  Vitaliy Churkin also had talks with Croatian Foreign 
Minister 
Mate Granic and informed him about his talks in Sarajevo and 
Belgrade with representatives of the Bosnian Serbs and with 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. They agreed that the 
Bosnian Serbs should be included in the negotiations as soon as 
possible in order for an integral solution, as well as peace and 
stability in this region, to be found.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, March 15 (TANJUG) -- The Serb Army 
headquarters in the republic of Serb Krajina said on Tuesday 
that the Croatian Army launched, on Monday, a fierce artillery 
attack on sector south of the republic of Serb Krajina, despite 
the ceasefire agreement. One Serb soldier was wounded and 
civilian buildings were considerably damaged in the attack. 
  The Krajina Serb Army headquarters specified that the 
Croatian attack, which lasted all day long, started in the wider 
Kozjan region, southwest of Korenica, which came under tank and 
artillery fire, spreading then to the entire region along the 
front line, west of Korenica and Vrhovine. 
  The headquarters statement said that Krajina Serb forces had 
responded to all attacks, and the Serb defence line remained 
stable. 
  According to the statement, the Croatian Army violated the 
ceasefire in the territory of the western Slavonija (sector 
west) on Monday, opening fire from small arms around the forest 
of Prasnik. The Croatian actions ceased when the Serb troops 
returned fire, the statement said. 
  A twice extended ceasefire between the Republic of Serb 
Krajina and Croatia has been in force since Christmas. It will 
be in force by March 31, when the U.N. Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) mandate in Krajina expires. 
  The republic of Serb Krajina has been declared by the Serbs 
in their ethnic and historical territories in Croatia, in 
response to Croatia's violent secession from former Yugoslavia 
and the downgrading of Serb civil and national rights by 
Croatian authorities. 
  The republic of Serb Krajina was proclaimed a U.N. Protected 
Area in spring 1992 following the conflict between the Croatian 
Army with the Krajina Serbs and the former Yugoslav Peoples 
Army. The U.N. peacekeepers have been deployed there under the 
Vance peace plan. Croatia has launched three offensives on the 
Republic of Serb Krajina since then, trying to take control of 
it by force.

Military Police Commander Says"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Czech Army has higher prestige abroad 
than at home. This is what Colonel Miloslav Cech told us 
yesterday. Recently, he has been appointed new commander of the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Military Police in former 
Yugoslavia. Colonel Cech will assume his post on 17 March in 
Zagreb. He will replace a French officer in this position and 
will stay in it for one year. 
  "The Czech Army has received high recognition since their 
officers have been appointed to the UNPROFOR command. Experts 
from European armies have had the opportunity during various 
meetings to learn about the qualities and capabilities of our 
professional soldiers, who were given priority over their 
colleagues from other countries." This is the way the new 
commander describes the fact that the number of Czech officers 
in high positions in the UNPROFOR peacekeeping forces have been 
increasing recently. 
  Jiri Novotny has become commander of the UNPROFOR Sector 
South Operational Staff, where the Czech soldiers are active. 
One of the Czech officers is likely to become the commander of 
the entire sector as of April, and another the commander of the 
Military Police in that part of the former Yugoslavia. 
  Apart from Colonel Cech, who will be in charge of soldiers 
from 20 countries, 22 additional Czech military police members 
will be active in the former Yugoslavia. The Czech UNPROFOR 
contingent should reach almost 1,000 troops this month.

<F P=106> [Article by "G. E.": "The Czech Army Does Not Shop in </F>
Vlasim"] 
  [Text] Vlasim--Yesterday, Defense Minister Antonin Baudys 
festively launched the production of the newly developed NATO 
5.56 x 45-mm cartridges at the Vlasim enterprise Sellier &amp; 
Bellot. This cartridge is standard issue in the NATO member 
countries, and we are the first former socialist country to 
produce something like that. The Vlasim enterprise used to 
supply ammunition to the Czechoslovak Army, but the shipments 
completely stopped after 1989. 
  To the question of where the Czech Army gets its ammunition 
now, if not in the Czech arms factories, Minister Baudys replied 
that our oversize Army has a large stockpile of ammunition and 
is gradually using it up. It is necessary also for the sake of 
expediency--many of the older cartridges will not fit future 
modern equipment. "If the Czech Army will have arms of this 
caliber, one that is used by NATO, it will certainly purchase 
its ammunition in Vlasim," the defense minister added. 
  Sellier &amp; Bellot is a stockholding company privatized 
in the 
first wave of coupon privatization. The company has not made 
use of the originally considered stock reserved for a foreign 
partner and recommended that the shares be placed in the second 
wave of coupon privatization. It has successfully made up for 
the decline in domestic demand by exports. "Today, we do not 
need foreign capital, although the munitions business is not as 
lucrative as people believe," said the chairman of the board of 
the stockholding company, Jiri Hanak.

<F P=106> [Article by Sabina Slonkova and Jan Cech: "Police in Western </F>
Bohemia Are Searching for Germans Suspected of Terrorism"] 
  [Text] Prague--Bavarian and West Bohemian police are 
searching for a group of seven Germans who are suspected of 
taking part in actions of the infamous terrorist organization, 
the Red Army Faction (RAF). Four women and three men have 
allegedly been hiding in West Bohemia for several weeks, where 
they arrived from Erfurt, Germany. This is what a high official 
from the secret service is saying. In connection with the 
undercover nature of the fight against terrorism, the officer 
wanted to remain anonymous. 
  The spokesman of the West Bohemian police, Jiri Soukup, 
confirmed yesterday that Czech police had received photos of 
terrorists from their German colleagues. There is a reward of 
50,000 German marks, which as about 870,000 korunas, for 
arresting any of them or providing information leading to their 
arrest. 
  The investigation conducted by the police has brought no 
results thus far. Miroslav Master, deputy of the West Bohemian 
police director, said that no evidence has been found suggesting 
that the terrorists are hiding precisely in Western Bohemia. 
However, it cannot be ruled out that they are in another part 
of the country. 
  The fact that the police are searching for the terrorists in 
the Czech Republic is not at all exceptional. People from the 
antiterrorist and counterespionage departments of the police 
have believed for a long time that intentionally sought-after 
terrorists are hiding in our country. They are particularly 
members of Arab terrorist commandos, who are hiding in 
unregistered apartments of people from Arab or Czech-Arab firms 
and RAF activists. Josef Doucha, of the Central Criminal 
Police, said in an earlier interview for MLADA FRONTA DNES that 
the probability of bomb attacks or other terrorist actions was 
smaller in the Czech Republic than in Germany, for example. 
  Experts on terrorism are of the opinion that terrorists 
could 
have established their hinterland in the Czech Republic in 
earlier times. Until 1989, the former Czechoslovakia was a 
frequently sought haven by foreign terrorist organizations, who 
used to come here at the invitation of the then communist 
regime. One of the most famous was, for example, Illych Ramirez 
Sanchez, nicknamed "Carlos," the chief of the Hands of the World 
Revolution.

  [Text] Warsaw, 14 Mar--Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, speaking at a 
news conference in Warsaw today, said that he met "very 
important people in Poland but that he could not name them." 
However, Janusz Bryczkowski, at whose invitation Zhirinovskiy 
came to Poland, said that these people are politicians and 
businessmen of the new, rising generation and not of the current 
political setup. 
  During the news conference, Zhirinovskiy devoted much 
attention to "Pan-Slavonic economic solidarity, in which Poland 
and Russia can play an important role." In his opinion, bank 
guarantees are needed for trade between the two countries. "We 
can give preferential treatment to Polish construction 
companies, including the construction of highways, among other 
things," he said. He announced that talks with Moscow banks 
would be held to discuss this matter. He did not exclude the 
possibility of his own company participating in this undertaking. 
  Asked for comment on Prime Minister Pawlak's visit to 
Moscow, 
Zhirinovskiy said that politics runs along two separate tracks. 
"If what is worked out by Poland and Russia turns out to be 
good, we will accept it. We are not going to reject good 
solutions," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Slawomir Popowski from Moscow: "Prime Minister </F>
Pawlak's Proposals; `Partnership for Development' With Russia"] 
  [Text] During Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak's visit to 
Moscow, four agreements are supposed to be signed: on the 
principles of employing Poles in Russia and Russians in Poland, 
on the quarantine of plants, on early warning about nuclear 
accidents, and on cooperation in the area of nuclear security, 
as well as on cooperation in the antimonopoly policy. 
  The Polish party also insisted on signing a commercial 
protocol for this year; however, it seems that these were all 
futile efforts. Moscow does not want to agree to the settlement 
mechanism proposed by Pawlak, which links Poland's purchases of 
strategic raw materials to the imports of our goods. 
  In this situation, Warsaw's initiative is especially 
noteworthy: It insists on specifying a catalogue of the issues 
that have not been settled yet and of problems that impede the 
development of economic cooperation. Similar protocols of 
dissimilarities have already been drawn up more than once. This 
time, however, the approximate date of their settlement should 
be fixed, and people responsible for that should be selected. 
Some people believe that this is the main goal of Prime 
Minister Pawlak's journey to Moscow. As one of the high-ranking 
Polish diplomats put it, if this is pulled off, we will be able 
to consider the entire visit a success. 
  It is worth adding that Polish-Russian economic relations 
are 
now in a deep crisis, which to a considerable degree is also 
related to the noticeable chilling of the political climate. 
For a year and a half, if we do not take into account the talks 
between both presidents, both states practically have not 
maintained any contacts. Most of the problems that impede 
cooperation and an exchange of goods and services have not even 
been touched. As a consequence, the Polish-Russian trade 
turnover again started to plummet more quickly. After a period 
of relative stabilization in 1992 (at the level of 50 percent of 
the turnover in 1990), the turnover in 1993 decreased by another 
39 percent. The decrease in exports of agricultural-industrial 
goods to the Russian market (by 62.5 percent) is especially seen 
as very alarming. 
  The main reason for this state of affairs is said to be the 
crisis of the Russian economy as well as drastic anti-import 
measures taken by Moscow. This is true. On the other hand, 
however, quite important is also the lack of any concrete 
decisions concerning indebtedness (as a result of which many 
Polish companies are simply afraid of conducting trade with 
Russia), let alone the fact that there are no instruments in 
place for supporting exports. There is even no bank that would 
handle trade with the East. 
  By leaving for Moscow with his own concept of a "partnership 
for development," Prime Minister Pawlak would like to unblock 
the Polish-Russian economic relations and deal with, as he put 
it, "the building of practical foundations of cooperation." 
According to the Polish prime minister, all of the great ideas 
have already been announced, and now it is high time for 
practical activities aimed at implementing them. The prime 
minister believes that it is possible to separate the economy 
from politics. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  "Right now the problem is not that we should sign further 
agreements because we have already signed many agreements, 
treaties, and declarations with Russia: We should see to it that 
our mutual relations are transferred to the level of activities, 
especially economic activities," Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
said yesterday before leaving for Moscow. The prime minister 
confirmed that, in Russia, he will discuss the "zero 
option"--that is, the proposal that the debts of both sides be 
annulled. 
  "During the meeting in Moscow, the problem of gas and oil 
supplies from Russia will also be discussed," Industry and Trade 
Minister Marek Pol said in the Polish Radio Third Program.

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Bazyl Lipszyc: "Independence but No </F>
Arbitrariness; If Prime Minister and President Approve Candidate 
Dariusz Rosati, He Could Begin Work 1 April"] 
  [Text] "The conversation with the prime minister 
concerned economic policies or, to put it in more precise terms, 
it was about a strategy for economic development and terms for 
cooperation." This is what Dariusz Rosati told us on Saturday 
[12 March] after his two-hour meeting with Waldemar Pawlak. 
Rosati is the Democratic Left Alliance's candidate for the post 
of deputy prime minister and finance minister. 
  Professor Rosati presented the prime minister with 
"Principles of Social and Economic Policies," which he has 
written. According to him, it is a precondition for the reforms 
to succeed, that inflation-free economic growth take place, but 
that will only happen if no radical changes are made to current 
economic policies. Positive trends must be strengthened, and 
possibilities for increasing investments and exports must be 
created. That should be implementedj, among others, by widening 
the availability of financial means, but without increasing 
inflation. Principles of action in the economy should also be 
stabilized, and privatization should be accelerated because it 
is a condition for increasing economic efficiency. 
  "Economic growth must be stimulated because the rise in 
inflation has been halted, and it is only by achieving permanent 
growth that one can lead to a decrease in unemployment and to 
increasing standards of living. Everything in the economy must 
be subordinated to measures aimed at increasing economic 
growth," Rosati said. "The increase in economic indicators 
observed in 1993 is very unstable because it was not based on 
investment or exports but only on an increase in individual 
consumption." 
  "We both agreed," Rosati said, "that right now a revival of 
the economy at the microeconomic level should be a priority 
because, when it comes to the macro level, the most important 
decisions have already been implemented." 
  "We also discussed organizational issues," Rosati said. "I 
would like to enjoy substantial autonomy when it comes to being 
in charge of the economy, and the prime minister did not object 
to that, but he did stress that it must be about independence, 
not arbitrariness. I want to increase the role of the Council 
of Ministers' Economic Committee, to have it make all economic 
decisions. One of my conditions is also better access to the 
prime minister, both with regard to conveying information to him 
and decisionmaking. Important issues must not be postponed. I 
must also enjoy autonomy when it comes to staff issues, and I 
must also have sufficient time in which to prepare my 
initiatives." 
  The candidate for the post of deputy prime minister also 
stressed that, during his conversation with the prime minister, 
he returned to the issue of Marek Borowski's resignation; he 
said he fully shares the prime minister's view and his decision 
regarding the resignation because there must be loyalty and 
trust and rapport between managers and their subordinates. 
  "The prime minister informed me that he will present my 
report to his advisers and members of the government and will 
let me know his decision within a week. If the answer is 
positive, I could take up the post effective 1 April, and that 
includes the time required for the president to sign the 
nomination and for me to wrap up my dealings in Geneva, although 
I am not sure whether that is a very good date on which to begin 
a job as serious as this one. 
  "My feeling is that the prime minister took note of my 
conditions and did not object to them. Waldemar Pawlak did not 
set terms of his own, but he did stress agriculture and some 
industrial branches--namely, mining, the defense sector, and the 
food industry," Rosati said. 
  He also said he had not discussed with the prime minister 
what the president's opinion on his candidacy might be, and that 
he informed the prime minister that, as regards the case of the 
Foreign Debt Service Fund [FOZZ], he has no reason to feel 
guilty and will gladly submit to an interrogation. He is just 
surprised that he should be interrogated now--that is, two and a 
half years after the investigation began. 
  Other members of the FOZZ Board of Directors, with regard to 
whom no charges had been formulated, just as with Dariusz 
Rosati, were questioned as witnesses a year ago, or even earlier 
than that. 
  "There are no differences between the prime minister and 
myself that would make cooperation impossible." This is how 
Dariusz Rosati summed up Saturday's conversation with Pawlak.

<F P=106> [Article by "ROD": "The French Connection: Minister </F>
Kolodziejczyk Is Back From Paris"] 
  [Text] "The West has for a long time avoided a debate on 
Poland's future, but I am convinced that this time we have 
witnessed a breakthrough," National Defense Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk said immediately after his return from Paris. 
  According to the National Defense Ministry [MON] chief, the 
costs of integration with the Western security system should be 
met using funds from the Office of the Council of Ministers' 
[URM] budget reserves. Kolodziejczyk will accept a vice 
minister designated by the government coalition on the condition 
that "the person has received substantive briefing." 
  In Kolodziejczyk's opinion, his meeting in Paris with French 
National Defense Minister Francois Leotard and German Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe ended on a note of success for the Polish 
side. 
  "Let the French minister's statement speak for itself here: 
`If the West fails to make any move toward Poland and the other 
countries we should thank for the collapse of the Berlin Wall, 
Poles will gain the right to call us cowards! We must no longer 
keep turning toward the Kremlin and speculating what it might 
mean that the current ruler there has knitted his brow," the MON 
chief quoted his French opposite number during a press 
conference convened in Gdynia. 
  Before the end of this year, joint military maneuvers will 
be 
carried out by Polish and Western army units. However, the aim 
is to create so-called small tactical forces, which will allow 
our armed forces to keep the costs to a minimum. Kolodziejczyk 
maintains that this will allow a reduction of the estimated 
expenditure on operations aimed at military integration with the 
Western European Union to 250 billion zlotys [Z]. 
  "I will not be looking for that money within the ministry; 
it 
should come from URM budget reserves. We will be able to find 
funds for the current year, but I am afraid that, in the future, 
we may face an embarrassing situation: We may be forced to 
admit that we do indeed want integration very much but that we 
cannot quite afford it." 
  Kolodziejczyk announced that "for legislative reasons, it is 
necessary to appoint a parliamentary under secretary of state to 
MON. 
  "I know that the Democratic Left Alliance has set its heart 
on its own candidate, and I am even quite ready to accept him as 
vice minister, provided he will have received substantive 
briefing, enabling him to cooperate with me."

<F P=106> [Article by Jerzy Pilczynski: "Another Citizens' Initiative"] </F>
  [Text] An Extraordinary Committee working on bills of 
amendments to the procedures for preparing and passing the 
Constitution has completed its work. At one of its coming 
sessions, the committee, chaired by Democratic Left Alliance 
[SLD] Deputy Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, will present the Sejm with 
three proposed amendments. 
  The first one concerns the holding of a preconstitutional 
referendum, proposed in a bill submitted by the Union of Labor 
[UP]. As was agreed upon during a previous meeting of the 
committee, it would be of an optional character; that is, the 
Sejm might, but would not have to, hold such a referendum. 
  On Friday [11 March], the committee also agreed to give up 
the idea of the so-called zero option--that is, the proposal 
that the seven draft constitutions submitted in the previous 
Sejm be declared invalid. This means that the drafts will be 
taken into account. 
  The committee also accepted the idea, submitted on behalf of 
the coalition by SLD Deputy Jerzy Jaskiernia, that the right to 
submit a constitutional draft also be granted to a group of 
500,000 citizens, if this support is backed up by their 
signatures. The period for the submission of these bills would 
be three months from the day the law comes into force. In the 
cases of well-founded doubts concerning the authenticity of the 
signatures, the Constitutional Committee of the National 
Assembly could request that the State Electoral Committee verify 
them on the basis of appropriate regulations of the Sejm 
Election Law. 
  A counterproposal was put forward by Krzysztof Kaminski 
(Confederation for an Independent Poland--KPN). He suggested 
that the right to submit a draft constitution be granted to a 
group of 100,000 citizens. 
  The issue of the citizens' constitutional initiative stirred 
up the most controversy during the Friday session. UP Deputy 
Janusz Szymanski and KPN Deputy Krzysztof Kaminski expressed 
their doubts about whether the committee can debate this motion 
because it is clearly an extension of the matter included in the 
amendment bills (prepared by the KPN and UP) the Sejm forwarded 
to the Constitutional Committee. It was claimed that this 
motion should be the subject of a separate legislative 
initiative; it was at the same time recalled that the Sejm 
recently rejected similar proposals submitted by the president. 
However, in the ballot that followed, the committee did not 
share these objections. 
  During the discussion, the bill was also criticized for 
something else: It was claimed that drafting a constitution in 
three months' time and collecting 500,000 signatures is next to 
impossible. 
  Deputy Jaskiernia polemized with this view; he claimed that, 
in practice, this period will be longer and that many groupings 
have already prepared or almost prepared their drafts. Setting 
a more remote deadline would excessively prolong work on the 
Constitution, which has lasted too long already, and would be 
dangerous. The explanation of the figure of 500,000 was the 
following: The right to submit a Constitution draft is exercised 
by, among others, 56 members of the National Assembly, who 
represent 1.2 million voters. Granting the right to the 
initiative to 100,000 citizens would mean unjustified privileges 
for the electorate of extraparliamentary groups. 
  According to Deputy Jaskiernia, the coalition has launched 
this initiative because, especially in a situation when the 
right wing refuses to cooperate in the creation of a 
Constitution, it wants to avoid the accusation that "the 
parliament members that are dealing with this fail to notice the 
citizens." Serving this purpose is the invitation of the 
representatives of the extraparliamentary parties to the work in 
the Constitutional Committee, abandoning the zero option, the 
possibility of holding a preconstitutional referendum, the 
constitutional citizens' initiative, and a confirming referendum.

<F P=106> [Article by B.I.W.: "Manifestation Monday of Solidarity; </F>
Until the Talks"] 
  [Text] On the eighth day of its protest, Solidarity ["S"] 
organized three demonstrations in front of voivodship offices in 
Opole, Wroclaw, and Walbrzych. A few hundred people took part 
in each of them. Twelve miners in Andaluzja in Piekary Slaskie 
started an underground occupational strike; however, the strike 
has nothing to do with the nationwide "S" action. Today, among 
others, a few dozen plants of the Bydgoszcz Region will go on 
strike. In the morning, "S" Head Marian Krzaklewski will meet 
with Senate Speaker Adam Struzik of the Polish Peasant Party 
[SLD]. They will discuss, among other topics, the budget and 
possible changes that the Senate may introduce. Struzik told 
RZECZPOSPOLITA that he will try to "reconcile positions." He 
may play the role of a mediator in the talks between "S" and the 
government. 
<H5>  The Prime Minister Invites Unclearly </H5>
  According to "S" National Committee [KK] Spokesman Piotr 
Zak, 
the prime minister's invitation to talks has been worded so 
unclearly that it is not known whether this is an invitation to 
the negotiations on the trade union's demands. They wanted to 
advance the date of the meeting between Waldemar Pawlak and 
Marian Krzaklewski by one day because, as Zak put it, "let us 
not waste time." After consultations at the Office of the 
Council of Ministers, it turned out, however, that the prime 
minister had reserved Thursday [17 March] for other activities. 
It seems that "S" did not like the fact that the prime minister 
had invited not only this trade union but also "Solidarity '80," 
All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement, and Trade Union of Miners in 
Poland [ZZGwP] (the heads of the two latter unions are deputies 
of the Democratic Left Alliance). Because only "S" is right now 
involved in the dispute and is conducting the protest action, it 
would indicate that the prime minister wants to discuss not only 
their demands or even that he does not want to negotiate. 
  At 1100 today, a meeting will be held between Chairman 
Krzaklewski and Speaker Struzik (PSL senator, member of "S"), 
who himself invited him to talk. Some "S" activists say that 
the union would already like to stop or at least to soften the 
protest action and finally begin talks. This is also suggested 
by the fact that "S" very seriously treated Leszek Miller's 
invitation to talks as well as by the fast response of "S." 
Such a possibility may arise after the meeting with the Senate 
speaker. Struzik told RZECZPOSPOLITA that he and Krzaklewski 
intend, among other things, to evaluate the current situation 
and to discuss the socioeconomic situation in the country, and 
so "a talk about the budget will probably be unavoidable." Much 
earlier, before the budget discussion and the voting, Struzik 
forwarded a letter to the KK, in which he wrote about possible 
changes in the budget. They were supposed to take that into 
consideration when planning their activities--right now, because 
there is a majority in the Senate (after amendments are 
proposed, the budget must return to the Sejm anyway) and as a 
representative of this chamber of the parliament, he will want 
to "reconcile positions." Asked whether he will fulfill the 
role of a mediator in the talks with the government, Struzik 
replied that he certainly would like this problem to be resolved 
favorably, but he does not know whether a mediator is needed 
because it was the government that launched the talks 
initiative. "The fact that the prime minister forwarded such an 
invitation indicates that we are all looking for solutions." 
  Marian Krzaklewski said on Gdansk television that he expects 
the meeting with the prime minister to be long and tough. He 
believes that a brief talk would mean rejection of "S" demands, 
and then the union's KK would immediately convene to make 
decisions concerning means of increasing pressure on the 
government. "The effect of our activities will depend on the 
force of the pressure," stated Krzaklewski. 
  ZZGwP Head Jan Kisielinski told the Polish Press Agency PAP 
that he does not think that meeting with the prime minister will 
be the result, among other things, of the "S" action: "Pawlak, 
at a time when he was not the head of the government, used to 
say that he attaches great importance to meetings with trade 
unions."

  Twelve miners in "Andaluzja" started an underground 
occupational strike on Monday; they demand immediate talks with 
the board of the Bytom Coal Partnership on a wage agreement. 
PAP reports that the mine's directors say that all of the 
strikers are miners from the partnership's 12 mines; they went 
underground "without the knowledge and consent of the directors, 
who are responsible for security." 
  Piotr Zak told RZECZPOSPOLITA that the protest has nothing 
to 
do with the KK action. At the last session of the Protest 
Headquarters, "miners did not rule out the possibility that 
there may be individual protests because there are wage 
problems." 
  Yesterday's demonstrators handed in petitions and "S" 
demands 
to voivodes. 
  Today, from 1000 to 1200, there will be a strike through the 
Bydgoszcz Region; however, excluded from the action are the 
Municipal Transportation Establishments, State Motor Transport, 
health service, education, etc. The heat energy plant in Elblag 
has not yet resumed supplying heat to the municipal and 
voivodship office in Elblag. In addition, one plant in Pila 
voivodship and several in Konskie, in the Swietokrzyski Region, 
will go on strike.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Andrzej Milczanowski by </F>
Katarzyna Nazarewicz and Piotr Zaremba; place and date not 
given: "Justice Rubs Its Eyes"] 
  [Text] [ZYCIE] Since 1992, you have changed your mind 
about separating the Office for the Protection of the State 
[UOP] from the Interior Ministry. Unlike several months ago, 
you no longer want the special services, intelligence and 
counterintelligence, to quickly become independent of the 
Ministry. Now that your Ministry is under the direct 
supervision of the Belweder, accountability to the prime 
minister represents a compromise with the postcommunist 
coalition. That seems to be the reason you no longer want the 
UOP to be independent, at least as long as Walesa is president. 
  [Milczanowski] When I myself was UOP chief, I wanted to move 
the UOP out of the Interior Ministry. But, to this very day, it 
is not very clear who the UOP should be answerable to--the 
president, the prime minister, or both men at the same time. As 
long as this remains unclear and is not laid down in the 
Constitution, one cannot risk causing an organizational mess in 
this vital sphere. But, frankly, it is questionable to have an 
intelligence service, involved in foreign affairs, supervised by 
an interior minister. 
  [ZYCIE] Supervision over the intelligence service is a 
political matter because it brings power. The present unified 
parliament and government have said that intelligence should be 
removed from the president's control as quickly as possible. 
But that is not possible as long as it remains part of the 
Interior Ministry and you continue to defend this state of 
affairs. 
  [Milczanowski] All at once I realized that there is no use 
hurrying with autonomy for the UOP because there are too many 
power centers that would like to gain possession of it. A new 
hotbed of conflict between the president, the government, and 
parliament would appear. I consider myself responsible for the 
work of the secret services, and, as long as there are no 
constitutional provisions governing the powers of the executive 
and the legislature, I will play no part in separating the UOP 
from the Interior Ministry. 
  [ZYCIE] As interior minister, you must have your own ideas. 
  [Milczanowski] I think the president must have the same kind 
of influence on the hiring and firing of the heads of 
intelligence and UOP as he already has on the hiring and firing 
of the interior, defense, and foreign ministers. That way, 
there is no danger of intelligence working for just one center 
of authority. 
  [ZYCIE] You sound convinced that there is a rivalry between 
the centers of authority in Poland. That is a cause for concern. 
  [Milczanowski] I do not agree with such rivalry, and that is 
why I wish to prevent hotbeds of conflict. 
  [ZYCIE] Many politicians, including Aleksander Kwasniewski, 
have been expressing their ideas about the new Constitution, and 
they say that the three ministries under presidential control 
should be accountable to the president and the prime minister. 
What do you say to that? 
  [Milczanowski] I see no problem with that. The Small 
Constitution and the laws governing the UOP, the interior 
minister, and the police all stipulate that I, as interior 
minister, have the duty to inform the president and the prime 
minister on all important matters concerning state security. 
  [ZYCIE] Minister Falandysz has said what might happen if the 
Sejm tried to fire you. He said the president would never agree 
to the dismissal of one of the three ministers under his 
jurisdiction, and, if the Sejm passed a vote of no confidence in 
the government on account of any one of these three ministers, 
the president would not nominate their successors. That 
confirms your peculiar status in the Pawlak government. 
Clearly, it is not the government coalition's wish that you be 
interior minister. How does it feel to be a foreign body in the 
government? 
  [Milczanowski] I have a Solidarity past, and, because of 
that, I was once in the Interior Ministry leadership. But I do 
not feel alien in the Pawlak government, and I possess a 
nonpolitical attitude toward my job. 
  [ZYCIE] Do you agree with this government's policies? For 
example, do you accept the Interior Ministry budget? 
  [Milczanowski] I have to. This is a question of loyalty, 
apart from which one has to be realistic about the size of the 
budget. 
  [ZYCIE] Someone has said mischievously that you are so 
flexible that you are willing to be interior minister in any 
government as long as Walesa is president. 
  [Milczanowski] I see no major difference between the 
budgetary concepts of the Suchocka government and those of the 
Pawlak government. The economic facts are harsh. Deputy Prime 
Minister Borowski's ideas virtually coincided with those of 
Osiatynski. I am not so interested in the things that lie 
beyond my ministry's scope. I wish to make it plain that I do 
not identify with any political party. I am a completely 
apolitical minister. 
  [ZYCIE] But you do not deny the fact that you were interior 
minister in the Suchocka government solely because of the 
Democratic Union's support? 
  [Milczanowski] I beg your pardon, but you are not quite 
right. Indeed, on 5 June, President Walesa invited me to become 
interior minister. I told him I would like to be UOP chief once 
again. But the president preferred me to be interior minister, 
responsible for the entire ministry, and not just UOP. I 
considered and agreed with a heavy heart. But I imposed a 
condition. I told him that, if he ever became dissatisfied with 
me or found someone better to take my place, he must let me know 
immediately and I would quit within 24 hours, without a word of 
protest. I never asked any party to support my application to 
be interior minister in this government. 
  [ZYCIE] But you remember that it is thanks to the 
Democratic Union's insistence that you became a minister in the 
Suchocka government. 
  [Milczanowski] When I was acting minister in Pawlak's first 
government and we had a Council of Ministers meeting, it was Jan 
Rokita who telephoned me and asked me what I thought about Artur 
Balazs being interior minister and I his deputy. I told him I 
did not wish to be an obstacle to the formation of a government. 
I said I did not have to be minister, and I did not have to 
accept his ideas. 
  [ZYCIE] But, in the end, the Democratic Union compelled you 
to join the government. Right now, all of the post-Solidarity 
parties are criticizing the Pawlak government. Even Geremek is 
talking about a postcommunist setup. So how do you feel being 
in such a government? 
  [Milczanowski] Statements by people in high places are not 
proper evidence. I feel responsible for the ministry. I am 
guided by two criteria: common sense and the interests of Poland. 
  [ZYCIE] That sounds rather vague. You are just as vague 
about your successor from the coalition. You say he must be 
intelligent, experienced, and professional. Have any suitable 
candidates been found? 
  [Milczanowski] It is too soon to say. 
  [ZYCIE] Is Democratic Union deputy Zbigniew Sobotka not 
suitable? 
  [Milczanowski] No comment. 
  [ZYCIE] When will you be able to say something? 
  [Milczanowski] Soon, perhaps next month. 
  [ZYCIE] Rokita described your appointment of Gromoslaw 
Czempinski as chairman of UOP as a slap in the face to all those 
who joined the Interior Ministry after 1989. 
  [Milczanowski] The older I am, the greater the doubts in my 
mind. Is a former Solidarity activist who sat in prison for a 
while, someone like me, better than a Security Service officer 
who risks his life for the new Poland? And, if this officer did 
not risk his life at all, is he better qualified to hold a 
responsible state post than I am? Perhaps he is better than I. 
  [ZYCIE] Than why don't you change places with Czempinski? 
He might be a better minister than you are. Those who are 
criticizing Czempinski are upset by the fact that he was an 
intelligence officer under the People's Republic. 
  [Milczanowski] I do not judge who should be minister. The 
UOP chief must be apolitical, that is all. 
  [ZYCIE] Do you really think a UOP chief automatically 
becomes apolitical when he assumes his post and that his 
political past is automatically erased? 
  [Milczanowski] I am acquainted with Czempinski's views, and 
I approve of them. He also insists that UOP is apolitical. You 
know why? Because, if someone suffers as much as the Security 
Service, intelligence, and counterintelligence have done since 
1989, one becomes tired of politics. UOP officials are 
reluctant to indulge in political extremism. 
  [ZYCIE] What is this extremism today? 
  [Milczanowski] If some party advocates the use of force as a 
means of obtaining power, UOP has to know about it. 
  [ZYCIE] But, in the past, Security Service men did serve a 
party that ruled by force. After the business with the files 
and the unsuccessful attempt to uncover Security Service agents, 
have your views about personnel vetting not changed at all? 
  [Milczanowski] Several thousand men who worked in the old 
Security Service have been positively vetted for jobs in UOP and 
the police. I do not think they should be thrown out just 
because of their past. Every case of discrimination serves to 
divide society. We did not fight for a democratic Poland in 
order to weaken the country's structures. One can build these 
structures with the help of those who used to be on the other 
side but who serve Poland loyally today. Today we need 
solidarity. 
  [ZYCIE] Does this solidarity also extend to former Security 
Service collaborators, people who used to secretly inform on 
their friends and neighbors? Are you still employing informers? 
  [Milczanowski] It is not out of the question. It is not 
easy to discuss this matter. Many people find the idea of being 
an informer disgusting. And yet many informers acted out of 
patriotic motives. 
  [ZYCIE] Most informers are paid or simply forced into 
collaboration. 
  [Milczanowski] All democratic countries use informers. 
Without them, there is no question of the intelligence services 
performing their work effectively. It is difficult to say what 
makes people inform. A person who informs out of patriotic 
motives may accept payment that serves to tighten his links to 
the security service. 
  [ZYCIE] Are you satisfied with the work of UOP? A UOP 
report on Zygmunt Solorz, head of PolSat Television, came into 
the hands of the president, the prime minister, and the chairman 
of the Broadcasting Council. 
  [Milczanowski] I am acquainted with this material, and there 
is nothing else I can say. 
  [ZYCIE] Can people be placed under surveillance for their 
political views and connections? 
  [Milczanowski] We are not engaged in that. 
  [ZYCIE] You sign every application to install electronic 
bugs. How many such applications have you approved? 
  [Milczanowski] I will not say. I even signed a few such 
applications today. 
  [ZYCIE] While we were talking to one of the leaders of the 
present coalition parties inside the Sejm building, he turned on 
the radio. The reason, he explained, was to fool whoever was 
eavesdropping on him. You might think he was obsessed with the 
idea of being bugged, but he is not the only one who is worried 
about your activity. 
  [Milczanowski] Who was he? 
  [ZYCIE] The work of UOP arouses concern among politicians. 
You are considered alien to all political structures apart from 
the Belweder. Have you any explanation why people fear you? 
  [Milczanowski] People are simply used to fearing UOP because 
UOP is burdened by the history of its predecessor, the Security 
Service. When I was still UOP chief, I answered telephones from 
all political groups--left, center, and right. Everyone was 
convinced they were being bugged by UOP. 
  [ZYCIE] In political cases, did you ever decide to install 
bugs? 
  [Milczanowski] I have already said I did not. 
  [ZYCIE] If fewer people worked in UOP than did in the 
Security Service, the Security Service's past would not be such 
a heavy burden. 
  [Milczanowski] During my spell in UOP, I got to know these 
people and learned to appreciate their work. I even grew to 
like them. If someone wants to be a responsible UOP chief, he 
has to identify himself with the people under his authority. 
  [ZYCIE] Why has the Interior Ministry consistently refused 
to release files on the subject of the slaying of Stanislaw 
Pyjas, the Workers Defense Committee employee? 
  [Milczanowski] We do not release material on the subject of 
personal sources of information. That is a matter of principle. 
  [ZYCIE] But if you refuse to release material on Pyjas to 
the Prosecutor's Office so that an impartial court can judge the 
issue, you are turning yourself into a judge, and a biased one 
at that. Do you not trust anyone? 
  [Milczanowski] The files have been examined with a view to 
ascertaining if any secret informer could have knowledge of the 
circumstances of Pyjas's death. The answer is no. 
  [ZYCIE] Who performed this analysis? 
  [Milczanowski] It was an internal Interior Ministry 
analysis. 
  [ZYCIE] But it is the Prosecutor's Office and the courts 
that should have a chance of assessing this material themselves, 
independently. You cannot act as a judge. 
  [Milczanowski] I disagree. I have a lot of experience and a 
bit of intuition. I know what is involved. As I said, I am 
opposed to revealing personal sources of information. If anyone 
compels me to reveal them, I will resign. 
  [ZYCIE] The Interior Ministry remains outside control. Not 
even a parliamentary commission could get any information from 
you. Have you a feeling of not being under anyone's control? 
  [Milczanowski] No. I might create the impression that I am 
tough and stubborn, but I am not. I am consistent, that is all. 
And I do not permit a violation of rules. Am I outside control? 
Look what the Sejm Commission for Administration and Internal 
Affairs is doing! Look at what the media are doing! You never 
leave me alone. You keep picking on UOP just for kicks. 
  [ZYCIE] That is what we are here for. 
  [Milczanowski] You ask about the links between the old 
Security Service and UOP. UOP is not a continuation of the 
Security Service, and, if I see the need to protect former 
Security Service employees, I do so for the sake of principles 
that are in force in every intelligence service in the world. 
The list of French World War II agents and collaborators is 
secret to this very day. 
  [ZYCIE] Have you always been so tolerant of people as you 
are of former Security Service employees and collaborators? 
  [Milczanowski] There is one thing I noticed not long 
ago--that work in UOP makes one tolerant of others. There is a 
tendency to see things clearly, in terms of black and white, and 
I have succumbed to this tendency. For me, the greatest 
difficulty is to see things in halftone, in semidarkness, and to 
reconcile differences. 
  [ZYCIE] Is this the result of working for the Interior 
Ministry? 
  [Milczanowski] Yes. In the Interior Ministry, one can see 
the complexity of human nature more clearly than anywhere else. 
One sees the negative side of the human soul, but also the 
positive side. In assessments, one cannot exaggerate. Every 
exaggeration is an offense. That is why I am offended by the 
extreme attitudes and statements of some people. I am annoyed 
by all of the sensation-seeking, unfounded statements and unjust 
accusations, and the manipulation of unverified data for the 
purpose of political gain. Sometimes, those shouting about being 
harmed and calling for justice are themselves harming others. 
What happens to justice then? Nothing. It merely rubs its 
sleepy eyes. 
  What do I wish myself the most? I have no major 
expectations. I would like things to be a little easier, that 
is all.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Defense Minister Boyko Noev by </F>
Lyubomir Denov; place and date not given: "Boyko Noev: The 
Time for Neutrality Has Passed"] 
  [Text] [Denov] Mr. Noev, is it true that you want to cut 
the army from 100,000 to 55,000 soldiers, as the leader of the 
Rakovski Legion claims? 
  [Noev] Many sins have been attributed to me recently. This 
has prompted me to overcome my reluctance to participate in 
public debates related to national security issues. 
  I categorically state that my lips never uttered and my pen 
never wrote the figure 50,000, or any other figure regarding the 
number of army personnel. This is not a part of my direct 
duties and I do not claim any qualifications in this sphere. 
  However, I have every reason to believe that the figure 
50,000 has been proposed to the minister of defense by a 
highranking officer. He was entrusted with the task of 
calculating what army we could maintain within the 13 billion 
military budget. 
  [Denov] Do you mean Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the 
General Staff? 
  [Noev] No comment. 
  [Denov] You have been accused of insisting on more decisive 
cuts in the army. Did you initiate the idea on officers' 
compensation in the form of privatization bonds, described by 
the military as "pieces of paper?" 
  [Noev] I have nothing to do with any compensation or "pieces 
of paper." 
  [Denov] Does the army have any alternatives within the 
framework of this miserable budget? 
  [Noev] Generally speaking, there are two alternatives: The 
first is the immediate beginning of the reforms. There are 
possibilities for this and, in addition, the leadership of the 
Defense Ministry is willing to do this. The second alternative 
is to leave things as they are, as though we were still at the 
time of the broad frontal operations of the time of the blocs' 
confrontation. I do not think that anything has radically 
changed in our structures since then. I think that the same 
applies to certain people's way of thinking. It is my 
pessimistic forecast that a further delay of the reforms will 
inevitably lead by autumn to an accumulation of problems, 
exacerbating the crisis and shortages in the troops. I hope 
that my forecast proves wrong. In any event, I will not be a 
dumb witness to such tendencies. 
  My only hope is in those employees in the Defense Ministry 
system, the officers and civilians, who are champions of the new 
ideas, and who are capable of proposing new solutions and 
breaking the old norms. Those people are not afraid to assume 
responsibility. 
  [Denov] Could the army cope with an eventual external threat 
to Bulgaria's security within the framework of this budget? 
  [Noev] Today there is no consensus among the political 
forces or experts about the external threat's character and 
degree. One should not make a great drama out of it. It is no 
secret that there is no consensus among the various units of the 
Ministry of Defense, either. 
  The "threat" is a matter of assessment and no one should 
have 
a monopoly over determining it. This is the situation in all 
the civilized countries throughout the world. The assessment of 
the threat must be a product of cooperation between the relevant 
state institutions. 
  [Denov] In your view, what is the goal behind fanning the 
military threat against Bulgaria? 
  [Noev] Fanning the threat of a war in the Balkans could be 
in pursuit of many internal political group and individual 
goals. It is my opinion that despite the formally existing 
tension and military imbalances along a part of our borders, at 
present Bulgaria enjoys significant security. What contributes 
to this is first of all the unique and stable strategic 
circumstances, second, our real association with the European 
and Euro-Atlantic structures, and last but not least, the 
prudent and balanced policy conducted by our relevant 
institutions. 
  I know that not everyone will be happy if I again repeat my 
conviction about the absurd character of the apocalyptic script 
that includes aggression against Bulgaria. I also do not accept 
the abstract threat that "if our neighbor's house is burning, 
our house is next." 
  The last thing that Bulgaria needs today is maintaining 
insecurity and a psychosis of fear in our society. This of 
course does not mean that there should not be an army. 
  What kind of army -- this is a worthy subject that should be 
discussed in a responsible manner by the Consultative Council on 
National Security at the Presidency. 
  [Denov] Is it not high time that this body began 
functioning? 
  [Noev] I think that this is the only body that can and must 
assume collective responsibility for solutions that have such a 
fundamentally social character. This is the only body which 
could prompt the beginning of the new stage of the military 
reform. 
  [Denov] Have you been punished for your statement that NATO 
should bomb Sarajevo? You said that limited air strikes do not 
jeopardize Bulgaria. However, later on the prime minister 
declared his opposition to air strikes. 
  [Noev] I will draw your attention to the consequences of 
NATO shooting down the four Serbian aircraft. Have you heard of 
anyone expressing concern for our security in this context, 
despite the fact that Greece declared a state of increased 
combat readiness in its armed forces? 
  This means that I was right. However, this was not only my 
position, but also the position of the president, the defense 
minister, and the other state institutions. 
  [Denov] Nevertheless, was there a dispute between you and 
General Brigo Asparukhov at the National Security Commission, 
when the possible consequences of eventual air strikes against 
Sarajevo were assessed? 
  [Noev] Yes, there was a dispute, but it revolved around 
principles. 
  [Denov] You are one of the great adherents to the 
Partnership for Peace initiative and joining NATO. What are 
your reasons? 
  [Noev] I was first of all motivated by the unanimous 
position of parliament, as well as the clear position of the 
government and the president on the same matter. Naturally, I 
am also led by the deep conviction that cooperation with the 
NATO states and with our former allies from the Warsaw Pact 
fully corresponds to our national interests. The more this 
cooperation strengthens, the more our security strengthens. 
  [Denov] Why is it necessary to cooperate with NATO? Certain 
politicians propose various variants of neutrality, such as the 
Finnish type? 
  [Noev] It is necessary to cooperate with NATO because there 
is no real alternative to NATO. This is the only 
military-political organization with proven potential and 
practical possibilities. In addition, only close cooperation 
with NATO and membership could provide us with those additional 
security guarantees, such as those that have already controlled 
the complex relations between our southern neighbors for decades. 
  I think that the time of neutrality passed with the 
disintegration of the bloc system. It is interesting that the 
champions of neutrality do not object to our membership of the 
European Union, which also means membership of the Western 
European Union. They also keep silent about the fact that this 
membership, which we unanimously desire in such a passionate 
manner, means that we relinquish to a large degree certain 
elements of our national sovereignty! 
  [Denov] How much will joining Partnership for Peace cost? 
Some people say that if we integrate into NATO we will have to 
change our weaponry completely, which means billions of dollars. 
  [Noev] First of all, this is a political issue, and it was 
already resolved a long time ago. In the long run we will 
profit from the partnership much more compared with the 
immediate consumer expenditure related to opening our mission at 
NATO headquarters in Belgium. 
  In this context, I would like to appeal to Bulgarian private 
capital, which could contribute very much to the direction of 
our integration. The annual expenditure of an optimal mission 
and a worthy representation of Bulgaria in NATO will not cost 
more than $250,000. If we receive this amount as aid from 
someone it will end the speculations that integration into NATO 
should be delayed because of the budget. 
  As far as rearming is concerned, it has already been said 
several times that integration does not presuppose total 
rearmament. It is NATO's position that standardization is not a 
problem that, in the final analysis, influences the political 
decision about membership. Thus the billions of dollars 
described by certain factors in Bulgaria as "unsurmountable" 
obstacles are mere scarecrows. 
  [Denov] After the so-called officer putsch the defense 
minister mentioned army cuts. How will these be effected? 
  [Noev] A special commission has been founded under the 
leadership of one of the deputy ministers of defense. This 
commission will optimize the structures and payroll and will 
reveal reserves from a more efficient utilization of the scant 
budget. I share the assessment that the payroll of the Defense 
Ministry and the General Staff is artificially inflated. There 
are many duplicating functions. Some warrant officers do 
inappropriate work. Many military employees are engaged in 
inefficient activities. 
  The results of this commission's work will be published in 
the second part of March; however, I would like to say that 
there will be no extensive or unprincipled cuts, or "throwing 
people onto the streets." 
  Furthermore, I have every reason to believe that the 
Ministry 
of Defense could set an example in taking care of its personnel, 
as has been the case in other countries. For me the ideal 
example is Great Britain. We are also studying the Russian 
experience. 
  Despite the lack of funds we could provide requalification 
programs. If we approach this subject seriously and 
responsibly, within six months we could be receiving 120 million 
leva from international financial institutions for the 
implementation of such programs. I think that the problem of 
compensation could also be fully resolved. I refer to the case 
when labor contracts are discontinued because of the closure of 
inefficient structures. Bulgarian officers, both on active 
service and in the reserve forces, must have a worthy place in 
Bulgarian society.

<F P=106> [Interview with Janos Wolfart, chairman of the National and </F>
Ethnic Minorities Office, by Istvan Javorniczky; place and date 
not given: "Minority Rights Do Not Depend on the Number of 
Ethnic Minorities"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Javorniczky] Is there any 
conflict today in the presence of national minorities here? 
  [Wolfart] No national minority group represents a danger to 
the state's territorial integrity and sovereignty. No serious 
politician in Hungary would claim this. On the contrary: our 
national minorities are suitable for playing a role of mediator 
in our relations with other countries. Our treatment of 
national minorities is also an internal training for our 
international relations, even if these national minorities are 
small in number. Including the Gypsies, their number is 
estimated at 1 million. However, only a quarter of this figure 
is confirmed by the census. There are traditionally-acknowledged 
national minorities, like Germans, Slovaks, Croatians, 
Romanians, Serbs, and Slovenes. Gypsies make up the largest 
minority group, and they are both the most heterogeneous and 
most divided group. There are also groups that have almost been 
forgotten, sometimes even by themselves, like Poles, Greeks, 
Ukrainians, Ruthenians, Armenians, Bulgarians. The law on 
national minorities lists 13 groups with special rights. They 
are Hungarian citizens and have been living in Hungary for more 
than 100 years as a group; they differ from the majority nation 
through their own culture and language. [passage omitted] 
  [Javorniczky] We know who the law regards as minorities. 
However, who regard themselves as minorities? To what extent do 
the people in question want to fall under a "dual evaluation?" 
  [Wolfart] This is changing. An increasing number of people 
are asking questions about what they are, where they come from, 
and where they are heading. This does not mean that a lot more 
people regard themselves as minorities on paper too. Besides, I 
think that it takes a longer time for someone to feel that he 
belongs somewhere and to also acknowledge this, and regulations 
and a proper atmosphere can reduce this time, but this should 
nevertheless be left to the individual to decide. Those who 
acknowledge that they belong to a certain ethnic group today are 
doing this more deliberately today than 30-50 years ago or in 
the last century. Belonging to an ethnic group and coexistence 
with the Hungarian nation does not lead to tension in Hungary; 
one does not have to deny one's own culture or one's Hungarian 
friend. It also derives from the fact that there is a very 
close coexistence and there are not homogeneous communities 
isolated geographically. The number of mixed marriages has also 
increased in recent years. [passage omitted] The national 
minorities living in Hungary do not feel threatened; nor do they 
represent any threat to the Hungarians. The current situation 
can be called basically friendly, and we hope this will 
continue. It is another matter that the national minorities 
will strive to represent their interests more firmly than 
hitherto and to increase the importance of their institutions. 
We should not be surprised and doubtful if they also formulate 
demands and problems, in addition to positive things. We should 
forget the idea that the national minority issue can be solved. 
Today we legislate a good law and make a few good decisions 
tomorrow, and everything is solved. Regulations are meant to 
enable the national minorities to make use of their rights and 
express what they find improper and press for the things they 
want. Obviously, the state and the political echelons will have 
tasks to fulfill. We must treat the national minorities as 
partners, because we cannot prosper otherwise. [passage omitted] 
  [Javorniczky] What are the major national minority rights? 
  [Wolfart] The basic national minority rights are also 
included in the Constitution. The state-founding role, the 
right to create self-governing bodies, the right to be 
represented, and the banning of discrimination are such basic 
rights. The law on national minorities stipulates that the 
national minorities have important rights as communities. The 
right to create their own organizations, the right to learn and 
use their mother tongue, and the right to have systematic 
contacts with their mother country are such rights. It is also 
the obligation of the state to guarantee and partially finance 
all this. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Gheorghe Tinca, recently </F>
appointed national defense minister, by Marius Petrean; place 
and date not given: "It Serves the Interests of the Army To 
Have a Civilian as Defense Minister"] 
  [Text] [Petrean] Mr. Gheorghe Tinca, after more than 50 
years, a civilian heads the Ministry of National Defense. Such 
a political move complies with the requirements of the Council 
of Europe and NATO regarding the control that should be exerted 
by civilian society over the armed forces; however, the move was 
made in the context of a domestic political situation marked by 
the issue of replacing certain persons in the government team. 
What were the foreign and domestic factors that led to the 
appointment of the "civilian" Gheorghe Tinca as head of the 
National Defense Ministry? 
  [Tinca] In other countries it is not unusual to have 
civilians lead their defense ministries. However, in our 
country, according to our traditions -- and history confirms it 
is a tradition -- we have always had a military person run our 
defense. But why did they appoint a civilian as head of the 
Ministry of National Defense now? Of course, we should not 
overlook the need for our country to adjust to international 
standards; however, that adjustment is not done automatically 
and in an unconditioned way, but rather by observing our 
national characteristics and interests. Besides the need to 
adjust to international standards, the appointment of a civilian 
as minister of national defense is even more important for the 
evolution, in a broader sense, of Romanian society. This 
evolution presupposes a different kind of harmonization of 
Romania's state institutions, among which the armed forces, as a 
fundamental pillar, play an important role. Constitutional 
states presuppose the existence of open societies; of course, 
the opening of society does not mean leaving the state to be 
blown away by the wind, or doing away with the borders, state 
institutions, and so on. That opening means -- in contrast to 
our former state ideology, which was active but stiff, and this 
finally led to its blocking -- that a new framework ought to be 
set up, in accordance with certain criteria elaborated on the 
basis of pluralism, to support that evolution. In a word, I am 
talking about the efforts made to modernize Romania, the 
Romanian state, and this is the context within which the 
appointment of a civilian as head of the armed forces should be 
viewed. 
  Our integration within the Euro-Atlantic structures is not 
taking place because the wind is now blowing from a difference 
direction, but rather because it offers real chances to 
modernize our country and return to normality in our economic, 
social, and political life. Despite the difficulties caused by 
transition, the Ministry of National Defense has achieved 
important things on the road of reform and those efforts will be 
continued within the framework of the Partnership for Peace 
concluded with NATO. Personally, I intend to continue the 
process of modernizing our armed forces and harmonizing them 
with our other institutions, and, if I can, to contribute to the 
furthering of that process. 
  As a matter of fact I believe that under the current 
circumstances it serves the interests of the army to have a 
civilian as defense minister. Being a fundamental institution 
of the Romanian state -- a law-governed country, in which the 
separation of powers is precisely established by our 
Constitution -- the ministry of defense has to participate in 
the dialogue that is specific for pluralistic states. At the 
same time the armed forces ought to concentrate on their 
specific mission. The presence of a civilian at the leadership 
of the ministry makes it possible for the military to 
concentrate on their profession and relieves them from having to 
deal with a number of things, in which the army -- as it turned 
out -- should not be involved. In this way civilian ministers 
can better defend and maintain the prestige of the army in the 
eyes of public opinion. 
  [Petrean] You have taken over the leadership of the National 
Defense Ministry in a dynamic, but also difficult international 
context, and that also goes for our national security. What are 
your "tactical" priorities? 
  [Tinca] When talking about national security, many people 
think solely of the army. There are times, when the army really 
plays the leading role; however, there are other times, when 
diplomacy does. In my opinion, the decisive role is always 
belongs to economy. In the current context, besides the 
importance of the economy, I think we are witnessing times when 
diplomacy and defense policy should merge in a singular effort 
to ensure the security of the country; both the armed forces and 
diplomacy ought to be in a vigilant state. 
  [Petrean] How do you assess the process of Romania's Euro- 
Atlantic integration? What trump cards do you think we are 
holding in view of the implementation of the ideas of our 
partnership with NATO, which presupposes a certain degree of 
compatibility both in the structure and the equipment of the 
armed forces? 
  [Tinca] Our trump cards are numerous and important. The 
first is our country's geographic position, which is a 
fundamental asset; that position is not merely important for us 
and this region, but also for the whole of Europe, and in a 
broader approach, even for the non-European areas neighboring 
the continent. 
  Our second trump is economic, and I am referring especially 
to Romania's industry. It is true, our industry was conceived 
in a way that later proved to be mistaken; it also needs to be 
re-equipped. But the existence of our industry is a fact. Well 
before 1969 Romania was already covering the largest part of its 
needs in defense equipment from its own sources and -- from this 
point of view -- it was greatly independent. 
  There is yet another trump card, about which we talk a lot, 
although we do not seem to be much convinced about its value: 
the human factor. There are 23 million Romanians -- not to 
mention the ones living outside our borders -- who can read and 
write; there are 23 million Romanians who were involved in 
immense efforts, even if some of those efforts were made to 
achieve projects that later proved to be lacking viability. Let 
us not forget that all those projects were completed by experts 
and those experts still exist. 
  [Petrean] Our Euro-Atlantic integration is one of the very 
few issues regarding which there is almost complete consensus 
among our political forces. How do you assess your future 
cooperation with the political parties? 
  [Tinca] I believe that the phase we have already gone 
through was more simple than the one that follows, because both 
the country's integration within the European Union, and the one 
within Euro-Atlantic structures will now enter the phase of 
deeds. Declarations, manifestations of political will are very 
important and serious things, and quite often it is not very 
easy to adopt them. However, in the coming stage we will have 
to take a great number of practical measures which may demand 
certain sacrifice on behalf of one part of society in order to 
achieve progress in another. There will be political interests 
that probably will not always coincide. 
  That is why in the future stage, on the basis of the 
existing 
consensus regarding our country's Euro-Atlantic integration, it 
is very important that the bearers of various political 
interests -- the parties -- should continue their dialogue and 
cooperation. It will be a process of permanent negotiations, in 
which all will have to set out from one principle, namely that 
when all is said and done we all desire the same thing: the 
modernization of Romania. I dare assume that the needs of the 
armed forces will be given special attention, as this is an 
issue of national interest. 
  [Petrean] You are a career diplomat, directly experienced in 
issues such as relations with various international bodies, 
problems of international security, arms control, and 
disarmament. What are the advantages and, if any, the 
disadvantages of your experience as a diplomat who has now 
become minister of defense? 
  [Tinca] My 28-year experience in diplomacy means a plus in 
certain domains: First, diplomacy is the science of knowing how 
to conduct negotiations, and that is a "school" that we 
politicians should all have graduated from. Diplomacy teaches 
one how to be flexible, but not in a gratuitous way, but rather 
as a method to achieve a general goal, such as, in my case now, 
the security of our country. Besides this, diplomacy is an 
experience that also lends one the ability to really "feel" 
one's partners, and a profession that furthers one's ability to 
behave calmly, tactfully, and wisely. Common sense, honesty, and 
loyalty are other such positive traits that may be added the 
ones I mentioned before. 
  On the other hand, I believe that it is also a handicap for 
me. The nature of my diplomatic experience (in security and 
disarmament issues) makes me able to perceive the entire volume 
of the things I ought to achieve, and, considering the 
dimensions of those tasks, I feel overwhelmed to a certain 
extent. On top of that, I am the sort of person who always 
tries to achieve perfection. 
  I am certain that I will be well understood -- even if not 
right away, but very soon, I hope -- by our officers' and 
command corps. I am also convinced that my good intentions, good 
faith, and sense of responsibility for the fundamental interests 
of our country will be fully perceived, and that our work 
relations will be based on my respect for the armed forces, on 
perfect sincerity, and honesty. It is to my real satisfaction 
and it makes me optimistic that -- having to deal with the army 
-- these relations will be definitely manly ones, which I have 
always liked.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Mar 14 (TANJUG) -- Moslem forces violated 
the ceasefire on the Sarajevo front several times on Monday, 
Bosnian Serb republic military sources said on Monday evening. 
  The command of the Sarajevo-Romania Corps of the Bosnian 
Serb 
army said in a statement that Moslem forces threw hand grenades 
and fired rifle-launched grenades at Serb defense lines on the 
Rajlovac front and that Moslem forces made provocations with 
infantry weapons in the area of Vrbanja Most and at the Ilijas 
front. Moslem snipers were not silent either and their targets 
were the barracks in Rajlovac and in the suburb of Faletici. 
  Moslem units carried out civil engineering works in the area 
of Mrkovic and the Jewish cemetary as well as along the lines of 
separation with the Serb forces on the Ilidza front. The 
Moslems are trying to advance their positions towards the Serb 
forces before the very eyes of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], 
which has been acting as a buffer between the warring sides 
following the withdrawal of heavy artillery from the Sarajevo 
area, the statement said.

  [Text] Novi Sad, March 13 (TANJUG) -- Hungarian Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszenszky and Deputy Yugoslav Foreign Minister 
Radoslav Bulajic on Sunday urged the promotion of bilateral 
relations so that they could reach their previous levels after 
the lifting of the international sanctions against Yugoslavia. 
  Jeszenszky is unofficially in Serbia's northern Vojvodina 
province since Saturday to attend ceremonies marking the 100th 
anniversary of the death of Lajos Kossuth, organized by the 
Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians (DZVM), the 
national party of the Hungarian minority. "Relations between 
Hungary and Yugoslavia should not remain at their current 
level," Jeszenszky told journalists after the talks in Novi Sad. 
"I hope very much that the inernational community's efforts will 
result in a peace in the former Yugoslavia and that all people 
who live here will overcome a difficult period," the Hungarian 
diplomat said. 
  Bulajic also expressed hope that the two countries' 
bilateral 
relations would soon attain a higher level and, with this in 
mind, he officially invited the Hungarian president and prime 
minister to visit Yugoslavia soon. 
  Jeszenszky also attended a commemoration of the 100th 
anniversary of the death of Lajos Kossuth held in the Vojvodina 
village of Novi Itebej, close to the Hungarian Border. The 
Hungarian foreign minister told the manifestation that it is 
always better to compromise in conflicting situations than to 
try to reach solutions by force, and expressed regret that evil 
and destruction imposed by others are still present in the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia. Recalling the historic role 
of Kossuth, one of the leaders of the Hungarian revolution of 
1848, Jeszenszky said that this was the period when the 
Hungarians, Serbs, Croats and other nationalities became aware 
that they have to live together in the Carpathian basin. The 
only way for their coexistence is tolerance and readiness to 
make concessions, because in a possible armed conflict all sides 
would be losers, Jeszenszky said. 
  The Hungarian press anounced that after Vojvodina, 
Jeszenszky 
would leave for Zagreb and Sarajevo.

  [Text] Zagreb, March 14 (AFP) -- A Russian envoy said 
Monday [14 March] he expected Bosnia's three warring factions to 
hold talks next week on an overall settlement to their nearly 
two-year-old war. The envoy, Vitaly Churkin, was speaking after 
talks here with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. Earlier in 
the day he met in Belgrade with Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic on a plan for a Moslem-Croat federation designed to 
end the fighting in Bosnia. 
  Churkin said he would meet soon with U.S. and European 
diplomats "and then I hope we will be able to move towards the 
next stage of this effort, that is a closer discussion between 
all the three parties of all the issues remaining, to have a 
final political settlement of the conflict." 
  He added: "I think that something more flexible might emerge 
next week than what usually is called formal talks because ... 
there would be a need for some flexible and a rather quick 
action." 
  Plans for the proposed Moslem-Croat federation were 
finalized 
Sunday in Vienna. The U.S.-backed blueprint calls for the two 
groups to link their territories in a loose federation that 
could later be joined with Croatia. Bosnian Serbs could exist 
alongside the new entity in their own state and possibly join it 
later in some form. 
  Of his talks in Belgrade, Churkin said Milosevic was 
"thinking of ways, not to reject but to incorporate all 
possibilities in a global agreement, which would take account of 
the idea of a confederation." 
  On Sunday, Churkin visited the Serb stronghold of Pale, near 
Sarajevo, where he met Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian 
Serb parliament. Churkin suggested there that the self-declared 
Serb republic in Bosnia could join the federation and eventually 
be linked with the rump Yugoslav state, comprising Serbia and 
Montenegro. 
  According to the Serb news agency SRNA, Krajisnik told him 
it 
was "absurd to ask the Serb side to join a federation with 
Croats and Moslems (...) without being able to have the same 
links with the Serb people" in Croatia and the rump Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta: "Oman Purchased the Tamara </F>
Radar System, but the Americans Are Assessing It"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Tamara passive radar system, a Czech 
state-of-the-art air-defense product, was evidently exported 
illegally to the United States in 1991. This statement was made 
by an Army source, who, with reference to his position, does not 
wish to be named. 
  He said that, according to the customs and commercial 
documents, Tamara should have been exported to Oman. However, 
it was not transported to the Arab sultanate but was exported 
from the Czech Republic to the United States via a Polish port, 
said the source. 
  The U.S. Department of Defense was interested in Tamara. 
According to the experts, the Czech radar system can reveal even 
the "invisible" Stealth aircraft, whose development cost the 
Pentagon billions of dollars. The U.S. Department of Defense, 
therefore, decided to have a look at Tamara. 
  However, Czechoslovakia would obviously not have sold Tamara 
to the Americans because U.S. research would have diminished the 
customers' interest in this product. 
  Jaromir Novotny, director of the Defense Ministry's Foreign 
Relations Department, has confirmed that the Americans now own 
Tamara. 
  The Trade and Industry Ministry has confirmed that, in 1991, 
a license was granted to Tesla Pardubice, the manufacturer of 
Tamara, to export the radar system to Oman. It is apparent from 
the documentation available that the Omani Defense Ministry had 
pledged to be its end user. 
  Germany is the only Western country to have this 
state-of-the-art radar system in its arsenal; it acquired it 
after the dissolution of the GDR National People's Army. 
Communist Czechoslovakia had sold Tamara and its predecessor, 
Ramona, only to the Soviet Union and Syria. 
  Josef Opocensky, the director of the Tesla Pardubice state 
enterprise, does not know anything about Tamara being exported 
to the United States and insists that it was sold to Oman.

said that economic arguments favor the formation of a great Slav 
community, in which Poland would also take part. 
  [Reporter Andrzej Kruszynski] I have visited all of the Slav 
countries from Poland to Bulgaria, the Russian politician said, 
and everywhere I saw stagnation, factories not working. Now, 
when the ideological system has collapsed, we can transfer the 
resources that until now have been earmarked for armaments to 
meet the economic needs. It is easier for us Slavs to reach an 
understanding because our languages are so close. At the same 
time, we will spend less on transportation in trade between us 
than in trade with the West. 
  Economic issues, including the strengthening of links 
between 
the banking structures of Poland and Russia, were discussed 
during meetings of the Russian politician with business 
representatives and, as he described it, with politicians of the 
new Poland. According to Zhirinovskiy, they are politicians from 
outside the present political setup. However, he declined to

  [Text] The National Coordinating Council of the Union of 
Democratic Forces [SDS] decided to hold the Sixth SDS National 
Conference on 14-15 May. The forum will discuss issues related 
to the election tactics, the future government, and the SDS's 
partners. 
  It was pointed out that the attitude of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] toward the government is totally 
irresponsible. The country's economic and political situation 
and the questionable status of the cabinet require the urgent 
initiative of President Zhelev, who, according to the SDS, must 
immediately begin consultations with the political forces. 
  The SDS sees the only solution to the situation in the 
country as early elections.

<F P=106> [Commentary by DUMA Editor in Chief Stefan Prodev: "Harsh </F>
Thoughts"] 
  [Text] Although its date is not yet fixed, the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] congress draws near. One senses this 
especially well in the local organizations that are preparing or 
holding their accountability-election meetings. Spirits are 
gradually being stirred, and thousands of Socialists are 
attempting to look into the future. They feel simultaneously 
attracted and alarmed by the idea, because the times are complex 
and changeable. On the one hand, hopes are high, and on the 
other, black clouds are gathering. Many want a sea change 
within both the party and society, whereas others fear any 
change at all. This brings people into confrontation, whether 
they want it or not, and casts them into conflict. 
  Of course, the conflicts should not be dramatized, whatever 
they may be. In times like these they are quite natural and 
mirror the essence of life. The BSP is still a party with 
traditions that have not outlived their time, a party of painful 
restructuring that fires it with different kinds of energy. It 
still wavers between recollections of the past and the present 
day, filled with glorious dreams and new political plans. There 
can be no doubt that this is what holds it in a state of inner 
tension, which, combined with crude antisocialist attacks from 
outside, makes it face major tests. However, despite everything, 
the party remains whole; despite the waves that rock the party's 
ship, it sails on toward the promised land. Those who expect 
the party to collapse will surely be disappointed, not because 
the ship is threatened by storms and leaks, but because its crew 
has a clear common goal, despite their sentiments and quarrels. 
This is the goal of social justice, of spiritual revival, of 
saving Bulgaria from blue [color of Union of Democratic Forces, 
SDS] ruin. This is more than certain, more than mere optimism. 
  However, the mere awareness that the conflicts are 
inevitable, even if they are not disastrous, is not enough. 
This must not make us either slightly gullible or 
overcredulous. In addition to their natural inevitability, the 
conflicts have their own inner tectonics, with unpredictable 
forces that are difficult to control. These are the forces of 
sharp confrontation, of complete rejection of the road we have 
traveled, that are concealed in the hardest layers of the rich 
party soil. For almost four years these forces have existed 
unseen, confused and frightened by the cataclysm in society and 
apparently doomed to remain immobile for all time. However, 
now, the slightest slackening of the political pressure or the 
crude aggression brings them out of the latent state into which 
they have fallen. They are now shaking themselves out of this 
state and are entering into the precongress dialogue, speaking 
sometimes softly, sometimes with more strident tones. Many of 
those who slept through the hard years in which the fate of the 
socialist idea was being decided are now coming onto the stage, 
ready to rout the saviors of the socialist idea. This is no 
longer simply a duel between two sets of views, but a kind of 
attempt at resurrecting the old and forgotten ideas. 
  Perhaps some of the more peace-loving among us will reject 
these alarming findings, but they should not be in too much of a 
hurry to do so. These findings are not invented. It is already 
well-known that there are some people here and there who propose 
to restore the party's old name, to declare once again its 
Leninist origins, to reestablish democratic centralism, and 
revive the party's revolutionary character. They not only doubt 
the advantages of democracy, but also reject its achievements so 
far, small though they may be. Some of them are even ready to 
deny the cause of DUMA and propose the reestablishment of the 
newspaper that for 45 years disseminated the so-called party 
truth -- the paper with its orders depicted on its masthead, 
carrying above its name the slogan that has lost its meaning 
with the passage of time. These people do not recognize party 
pluralism, they reject separate ideological trends, and accuse 
anyone who thinks more freely of treason. Having failed to 
understand the present and being alien to its complex nature, 
they daydream about "their own" time, as if history was able to 
bring it back for them. See how many old and rejected 
conceptions about the party and life are trying to varying 
extents to influence the precongress dialogue and deflect it in 
a wrong direction. There should be no doubt that certain 
retrograde circles that missed their chance need an earthquake 
and are trying to provoke one. They will certainly fail, 
because they form part of the rear baggage train of the BSP and 
social development, but this does not mean that we should 
underestimate them. They are in our midst, and this is good 
enough reason to put us on our guard. It is not only the sick 
imaginations of the right-wing forces in the SDS, but also these 
friends of ours who are nourishing the fiction of some kind of 
recommunization. Their threadbare thoughts and ideological 
visions not only scare the Socialist Party, but the general 
population as well. 
  The awakening of these subterranean strata within the BSP 
is a major warning signal for the upcoming congress. It will be 
dangerous, as well as harmful, if they are able to influence the 
work of the congress. Then the congress will become an arena 
that will disturb not only the party, but society as well. In 
this context, the election of delegates to the congress is 
transformed from a formal procedure into an almost momentous 
act. The party organization should send to their supreme forum 
not merely "our own people" or "good comrades," but individuals 
who have proved their political maturity and wisdom, persons 
totally dedicated to the new spirit of the BSP and determined to 
make a final break with the past and transform the BSP into a 
truly modern party, which means a party with a deep awareness of 
parliamentary democracy, a party of broad social dialogue, a 
party with a pluralistic approach to the problems, and a lofty 
national awareness. It must be a party of people whom Bulgaria 
values and loves. If this does not come about, the congress 
will take a wrong turn, whether we want it or not. The times of 
pompous statements, empty speeches, pledges of loyalty, 
ideological sentiments, and even more sentimental concepts of 
the future are past and gone. Every elected delegate must enter 
the congress hall aware that he is a man of the new time, that 
he defends a socialist idea in an antisocial society, and that 
our goal today is not simply power, but the salvation and 
ennoblement of man. At the present moment, the BSP can have no 
higher goal than this. Anyone who does not understand this may 
speak eloquently, but he will not be of the least help. 
Therefore, those who disturb the people with their outmoded 
speeches and degraded ideas about life should not seek to be 
called to the speaker's platform. They can only blow up the 
party and change it from a means to achieve new changes into a 
bunker for unnecessary battles. 
  I do not know whether everyone will agree with the content 
and deep feeling embodied in the thoughts I have expressed. 
However, this is not important. It is more important for them 
to instill these thoughts in their own consciousness and 
remember them when they have to assess one or another form of 
conduct. For the people from the party's rear baggage train, 
those who are launching reckless criticisms that do not in the 
least help the new spirit, do not deserve to be patronized. 
They are noisy disrupters of the calm and are seeking backdated 
recognition. One may understand them from a purely human 
viewpoint, but they must receive no support or encouragement. 
Their belated energy is no help to the BSP. Although in many 
cases it is sincere, it is not beneficial. The only thing that 
this energy can achieve is to exacerbate the inevitable 
conflicts that I mentioned in the beginning, and turn them into 
a crisis. Let no one forget that our party contains many new 
shoots. If we want to keep it whole, we should neither accuse 
them nor trample them in the mud, as certain rough "gardeners" 
seem to be doing just now. Therefore, let us listen to what 
they have to say, because they have the right to speak, but let 
us not follow their advice. Their way does not lead anywhere. 
It cannot be the way of the BSP, because the party of the 
Bulgarian Socialists wants to live despite the difficulties and 
bad omens. It is not a rock, as some like to think, but a 
spring, a spring for the thirsty to drink from, not for those 
who are looking for somewhere to wash their old clothes.

  [Text] A high-ranking NATO officer has confirmed that the 
AWACS planes patrolling in Hungary's airspace contributed to the 
shooting down two weeks ago of four Serb aircraft that had 
violated the UN air exclusion zone over Bosnia. 
  The NATO European Command's deputy chief of staff 
responsible 
for operations said that NATO was not surprised when Budapest 
asked that no AWACS planes should be in Hungarian airspace at a 
time of a potential NATO air strikes in Bosnia. However, in 
order to have effective intelligence it was necessary for NATO 
to obtain data from the AWACS planes located over Hungary. 
  The general also said that NATO was in constant radio 
contact 
with Hungarian Government organs and the Hungarian military air 
defense leadership.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lajos Fur, defense minister and chairman of </F>
the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Dezso Pinter; place and date 
not given: "The Opposition Is Also To Blame for the Silence of 
the Majority"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Pinter] What, in your 
view, are the effects on society of the events at Hungarian 
Radio? 
  [Fur] Visibly and regrettably, the developments in the radio 
have an impact on political life. However, they certainly do 
not have any effect on society. Dealing with these kinds of 
internal affairs of an institution is the least of society's 
problems. As for the allegation that the government is behind 
the dismissals, I have to refute it most firmly. 
  [Pinter] What is your reaction to the view that, since you 
were elected party chairman, you have subordinated all your 
political activities exclusively to the propaganda of success? 
  [Fur] This view is unfounded and unjust. We are in a period 
of assessment and we should not tolerate a situation in which 
only our failures and mistakes are revealed to society. This is 
not because it hurts us but because it creates a distorted 
image, and only provides the voters with a basis for drawing the 
wrong conclusions. Noisily and with demagogic methods rather 
than arguments, our competitors are trying to take away from us 
even those results that can be proved to have been achieved by 
us since 1990. The barrage has persisted since the moment our 
government took office, and it has had some effects. Our period 
of being defensive has ended. We are not just advertising our 
successes, we are providing information about the facts. The 
economic decline began at the beginning of the 1980's -- partly 
as a result of the radical change of external circumstances, the 
south Slav war and the embargo, and the difficulties that went 
with the change of regime -- it accelerated from 1990, but we 
cannot talk about a slump. The year 1993 was the turning point. 
At the moment, we can only talk about some development in 
comparison with the beginning of the decline but this does not 
yet mean the rise of the nation. The favorable tendencies of 
1993 are continuing in 1994. A 6 to 7 percent inflation was 
projected for January but the actual figure was 3.2 percent. 
This is a fact. For some people, stating this fact is the same 
as the propaganda of success, but for us, it is proof that we 
are following the correct road. 
  [Pinter] Is it also not a fact that there are many people in 
this country who have been left to fend for themselves and are 
stumbling along this road with ever greater difficulty? 
  [Fur] It is. However, encouragement supported by the facts 
is also meant for those who, as a result of their increasingly 
desperate living conditions, feel that this government coalition 
or this system has left them on their own. We do not want to 
make the situation look better than it is, because it also is 
depressing for us, but it is not paralyzing. We must not talk 
about hopelessness. 
  [Pinter] Have you formed an opinion on the campaign behavior 
of other parties? 
  [Fur] The opposition is mainly trying to gain social support 
by damaging our reputation. They want to blame us for all the 
troubles of the transformation. The favorite statement of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party's [MSZP] chairman [Gyula Horn] is that 
this government was characterized by unprecedented dilettantism. 
Says he, who was formerly part of the power that was almost 
completely unable to do anything to stop and reverse the 
damaging processes. Under the rule of their great expertise, 
only the negative things were accumulated. However, what is 
really dangerous is that many people are making irresponsible 
promises to the nation. Should they get into government, it 
would soon be discovered that they have misled society, and this 
would result in a formerly unseen -- mainly moral and economic 
-- crisis for the country. Chaos could reappear where there 
should be order. 
  [Pinter] Do you link the danger of this chaos with the fact 
that various ideologies are gaining ground? 
  [Fur] The unshakably left-wing and liberal ideology that is 
created at writing desks will prove to be a restraint on social 
development. During the decades of socialism, we had the chance 
to experience the true meaning of ideological obsession. An 
invented theoretical system was forced onto reality. I caution 
the country against a power whose thinking is so much within 
theoretical limits. It is to be feared that the representatives 
of a power like this would follow the example of the Bourbons 
and we will find that they have not learned or forgotten 
anything. 
  [Pinter] According to many surveys, the left wing has gained 
significant support in recent months. When you formulate your 
sharp criticism, are you not worried that, because of the terms 
you use, you will find yourself irrevocably opposed to the 
section of society that supports the left wing? 
  [Fur] My intention is completely different. I certainly do 
not want to get into a conflict with anyone. As a believer, I 
do not have hatred for anyone. It is always the political 
thoughts and mentality that I criticize. I am concerned for the 
country in case the left wing comes to power. This danger 
exists because, after four decades of dictatorship, this way of 
thinking -- and please do not forget: organization -- has its 
traces in society. 
  [Pinter] Do you hope that the election campaign and your 
arguments will change this? 
  [Fur] Undoubtedly, I believe in the power of words, and that 
the expression of various realizations can divert thinking 
people in the right direction. I am aware that people who have 
very much committed themselves to the joint political action of 
the MSZP and the trade unions, or the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ], which is drawing closer to the left wing double quick, 
will not be much influenced by my arguments. It is almost as 
important, however, to win the silent majority to ourselves. 
They make up 50 percent of society in Hungary. [passage 
omitted] They will decide the fate of the elections and what 
side the country, which is unfortunately still very quiet, will 
take. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] While you are constantly warning the country 
against expecting miracles, is it not possible that the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is expecting a miracle as far 
as its own fate is concerned? 
  [Fur] The only thing we trust in is that the country will 
appreciate our results and efforts. There are encouraging signs 
for this. 
  [Pinter] Are there any signs of this that you deliberately 
do not talk about? 
  [Fur] We do not have secrets. 
  [Pinter] In your view, how successfully are the MDF 
politicians, who face the country's public, serving the 
intention to gain more ground? 
  [Fur] The MDF's national committee does not necessarily 
agree completely with all statements. However, I am not aware 
of major deviations. The slight differences, on the other hand, 
are explicitly useful. For example, the MDF's liberal, 
Christian, and conservative wings are still mentioned. I find 
the term conservative more acceptable than populist-national, 
which has been torn to shreds. 
  [Pinter] Do these tendencies actually exist? 
  [Fur] They do not exist as political tendencies. However, 
we can say that our members have different ideological sources 
of thought. Some were more affected by national liberalism, 
others by Christian democracy, or conservatism. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Pinter] Do you have any contact with Istvan Csurka [co- 
chairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party, MIEP]? 
  [Fur] I do not. 
  [Pinter] And with the MIEP? 
  [Fur] No. 
  [Pinter] Do you see this the only natural state of affairs? 
  [Fur] I do. 
  [Pinter] Does your answer also mean that, regardless of the 
election results and the political situation that arises 
afterwards, there can be no common road for the MDF and the MIEP? 
  [Fur] It is impossible for this kind of road to exist. The 
MIEP is attacking us in an astonishing style. It is outright 
shocking that Csurka and Jozsef Torgyan [chairman of the 
Independent Smallholders Party] participated in a joint 
demonstration in the Sports Hall. 
  [Pinter] Was it this fact that shocked you or what was said 
there? 
  [Fur] The fact that this joint appearance took place. What 
the participants said was nothing new. In the past, we already 
had the chance to be shocked at what they had to say. 
  [Pinter] In your view, is Csurka's and Torgyan's supporting 
camp growing? 
  [Fur] Not at all. The followers come from a narrow social 
group. Many of them are unable to process their injuries or are 
psychologically broken, perhaps misled people. 
  [Pinter] Are you sure that the MDF membership has the same 
views on Csurka's and Torgyan's politics and supporters? 
  [Fur] If there had been any supporters of these people in 
our party, they would have left us and joined Csurka's and 
Torgyan's parties. The unity and atmosphere of our seventh 
national meeting should have convinced the doubters and those 
who are sincerely concerned about our political line. Not one 
of the 720 deputies who gathered there appeared as a supporter 
of undesirable tendencies. 
  [Pinter] After the national meeting and your election as 
party chairman, is your cooperation with Prime Minister Peter 
Boross changing in any way? 
  [Fur] Only in the sense that our cooperation is even 
stronger. I can say the same about [Deputy Chairman] Sandor 
Lezsak, the other key character in our party. These three 
people are operating without any problems. We will take care to 
keep it this way. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] What do Boross's prime ministerial activities so 
far mean for the MDF? 
  [Fur] A huge gain. Boross has brought a powerful pragmatism 
into governing and politics in general. His legal training and 
experience as a company leader make him very well informed in 
the details of state administration. The membership expects a 
lot of him. 
  [Pinter] What is your reaction to the loose and not very 
clearly defined election cooperations? 
  [Fur] With some reservation and acknowledgment. The left 
wing has obviously sorted itself out, while there is much 
uncertainty at the liberals. We are not certain if the SZDSZ is 
one of the left- wing parties. It shows itself to be one 
because it is getting increasingly close to the idea of forming 
a coalition with the MSZP. it is strange because a liberal party 
by no means can belong to the left wing. I wonder if the 
supporter of a social-liberal model can belong to the liberal 
bloc. 
  [Pinter] Do you also have doubts about the line of the 
Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]? 
  [Fur] Not at all. There have been serious changes in the 
Fidesz, the supporters of the social-liberal solution have left 
the party. 
  [Pinter] In a situation when the coalition is being planned, 
has this made the Fidesz a more attractive party for you? 
  [Fur] I can answer this when I see the election results. In 
my view, a regular dialogue on various practical issues is 
certainly possible. This could be very useful in the remaining 
period of parliament. 
  [Pinter] Have you been surprised by the Christian 
Democratic People's Party [KDNP] statements in connection with 
the MDF in the campaign? 
  [Fur] I do not think it is right to try to blame the MDF for 
the corrupt practices in privatization. They have also made 
some other badly worded criticisms. Regardless of this, the two 
parties, which are in close relationship, often fight for 
completely identical goals. 
  [Pinter] Could relations between the MDF and the KDNP become 
tense in the fight for votes? 
  [Fur] No. We see this campaign as a running race, rather 
than a boxing match. 
  [Pinter] Does this understanding apply to all participants? 
  [Fur] It certainly applies to the current coalition 
partners. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] Are you not preparing to continue your activities 
in opposition after the elections? 
  [Fur] This possibility does not exist in my conscious mind, 
it might exist in my subconscious at most. On the basis of what 
I can see now, I say that we will succeed. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] Do you expect we will have a parliament that can 
give a stable government to the country until 1998? 
  [Fur] Only if the calm and sober political forces get the 
majority. All other solutions hold out the danger of a 
standstill and anarchy. We should not upset the country. 
  [Pinter] Do you think that this is what would happen if the 
current opposition came to power? 
  [Fur] I do, equally in politics and the economy. The 
country cannot take this risk.

<F P=106> [Simona Popescu note: "The Romanian Intelligence Service </F>
Commission: Virgil Magureanu Appears Before It"] 
  [Text] During its session yesterday [9 March] the 
Supervisory Commission of the Activity of the Romanian 
Intelligence Service [SRI] heard [SRI Director] Virgil 
Magureanu, who presented the report of the institution that he 
heads on "certain leaks from within the SRI and accusations 
against certain persons or groups of persons whose actions might 
affect the national security." 
  SRI investigations conducted thus far "indicate that this 
institution has not been and is not involved in the mass media 
dissemination of the respective materials" (materials published 
by the ROMANIA MARE weekly, which contained accusations of 
espionage for foreign secret services -- our editorial note). 
However, as the report points out, the guilt has been passed 
onto certain former employees of the counterespionage or foreign 
intelligence services. In conclusion, the SRI report stresses 
that "after studying and examining the materials published in 
ROMANIA MARE, it has been ascertained that certain data sent to 
legal consumers were the basis of articles published by Corneliu 
Vadim Tudor [owner and chief editor of ROMANIA MARE weekly]"; 
consequently, the documents were not appropriated from SRI 
archives, but were lost en route from one institution to another.

  [Letter from Virgil Magureanu, director of the Romanian 
Intelligence Service, to Vasile Vacaru, chairman of the Joint 
Standing Commission of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate 
for Parliamentary Control Over the Activity of the Romanian 
Intelligence Service, in Bucharest on 9 March] 
  [Text] Romania, the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI], the 
Director's Cabinet; document No. 019124 of 9 March 1994 -- 
Secret; Only copy. 
  To Mr. Senator Vasile Vacaru, chairman of the Joint Standing 
Commission of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate for 
Parliamentary Control Over the Activity of the Romanian 
Intelligence Service: 
  Regarding certain leaks of information from within the SRI 
and the accusations against certain persons or groups of persons 
whose actions might affect the national security, we state the 
following: 
  Regarding the article "The Alarm Bell -- The Setting Up and 
Functioning, Under the Guidance of Some Foreign Secret Services, 
of an Organized Group Placed in Official Positions," published 
in the weekly ROMANIA MARE No.185/1 Jan 1994, as well as in 
connection with other such materials, we have the following to 
say: 
  An examination of the ROMANIA MARE article reveals that it 
was not based on secret information, which might have come from 
our institution, but rather on information obtained from a 
number of real situations, known to the public, such as: 
  -- The persons accused in the article have worked in various 
former institutions (the Institute of Political Studies, the 
Center of Military Theory and History, the Institute of World 
Economy, or the International Law and International Relations 
Association-ADIRI); 
  -- The official activities carried out by ADIRI and its 
personnel, which also included links with institutions and 
individuals abroad, especially from the United States and 
England; 
  -- Scholarships granted by this institute for specialization 
courses to two of the accused individuals; 
  -- The statements made by Messrs. Vasile Secares [rector of 
the Romanian National School of Political and Administrative 
Studies (SNSPA)] and Ioan Mircea Pascu [secretary of state at 
the Ministry of National Defense] in their interviews with daily 
AZI on 6 and 26 February 1990, full passages of which were taken 
over (with a number of comments and interpretations by the 
author of that article) by the magazine and actually represent 
the substance of that article. 
  However, given the allegations about certain named 
individuals and institutions belonging to some foreign 
intelligence services, one can assume that the author of the 
article has used the favors of certain former cadres of the 
counterespionage of foreign intelligence services, who, by 
putting together and interpreting certain data, arguments, and 
suppositions, have managed to confer an aura of professionalism 
on that article. 
  A possible argument in favor of this supposition is the fact 
that, in the 1990-1992 period, similar accusations against other 
political figures of those times -- Silviu Brucan, Dumitru 
Mazilu [former top leaders of the post-1989 National Salvation 
Front Council], and so forth -- were published by ROMANIA MARE 
and the SPIONAJ-CONTRASPIONAJ [ESPIONAGE-COUNTERESPIONAGE] 
magazine led by former Securitate General Neagu Cozma; the 
authors of the incriminating articles must have had access to 
material about individuals with connections abroad, known to 
have belonged to the Third Directorate of the State Security 
Department [DSS], who could be found in the files of retired 
Major General Aurelian Mortoiu and retired Colonel Filip 
Teodorescu, files that were taken over by Vice Admiral Stefan 
Dinu, after his appointment to the command of the respective 
union. 
  The SRI cannot be accused of consciously keeping silent 
about 
the matter raised, as claimed by Mr. Senator Eugen Dijmarescu 
[of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front)] in his 
letter sent to Romania's Senate, a letter that was presented to 
us during our appearance before the Joint Standing Control 
Commission on 9 February 1994. 
  That the SRI did not take an immediate official stand 
vis-a-vis the respective press materials can be explained by the 
fact that it had to conduct certain checks, which took time, 
until final conclusions could be drawn, which rebutted the 
allegations in the aforementioned article. 
  From the checks done so far, it results that the SRI has not 
been and is not involved in any way in the mass-media 
dissemination of the respective materials. The SRI itself is 
the first one interested in blocking any leaks of information. 
  Regarding the publication by ROMANIA MARE of material about 
alleged criminal activities by Major General Gheorghe Florica 
[former general commissioner of the Financial Overseeing Body 
until 1993], we state the following: 
  An investigation into the activities of an Arab citizen, 
known to belong to an extremist-terrorist group operating on 
Romania's territory, has shown that he had criminal links both 
with the former chief of the Financial Oversight Body and with 
other Romanian citizens and foreigners. 
  In this respect, all proof collected by our service was 
forwarded to the relevant state institutions authorized to take 
appropriate steps in this respect and were used by them in 
resolving their cases. 
  The study and examination of the material published by 
ROMANIA MARE reveal that some of the data sent to the legal 
consumers (various institutions) was at the basis of the 
articles published by Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor. (As a 
matter of fact, our institution will continue its investigation 
to establish the way in which this data, which was not meant for 
publication, has been disseminated. 
  Regarding the letter sent to you by George Sergiu Rizescu, 
deputy of the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party 
[PNTCD] from Arges, who asks that one should clarify his alleged 
collaboration with the former Securitate and the SRI, we state 
the following: 
  EVENIMENTUL ZILEI on 11 July 1992 published some material 
from the archives of the former Arges County Securitate branch 
regarding certain informer files, which also included the names 
of certain PNTCD leaders from Arges. 
  The same issue of the newspaper published the transcript of 
a 
recording -- registration number 0012806 of 3 March 1992 -- 
belonging to the Arges County Intelligence Section, which 
contains references to Mr. Deputy Sergiu George Rizescu, who, on 
one occasion, allegedly told his entourage about the PNTCD's 
position vis-a-vis the parliamentary elections due to be held in 
1992. 
  The results of the investigation carried out by the SRI to 
elucidate this case were at the basis of legal suit No. 302576 
of 20 July 1992 started by the SRI against EVENIMENTUL ZILEI 
editors Dan Andronic and Ion Cristoiu for disclosure of state 
secrets as well as against Lieutenant Colonel Emilian Oprescu, 
active officer at the Arges County Intelligence Section, for 
negligence shown in keeping state secrets. 
  The case is being investigated by the military prosecuting 
magistracies of the General Prosecutor Magistracy of the supreme 
Court of Justice, under penal file No. 395/P/1992. 
  As shown by the text of transcript of recording No. 0012806 
of 3 June 1992 published in daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, Mr. Deputy 
Rizescu has not been and is no "source of information" for our 
institution. 
  On the other hand, the checks we have conducted in the 
archives of the former Securitate -- documents that can be 
accessed to in accordance with the provisions of Article 45, 
Paragraph 4 of Law No. 14 -- show that Mr. Deputy Sergiu George 
Rizescu has not been part of the Securitate's network of 
informers. 
  Constantly concerned with ensuring the protection of the 
information it holds (a specialized body in charge of this task 
is actually operating within our institution) and with 
drastically and promptly punishing any violations in this 
respect, the SRI emphasizes the urgent need to elaborate a set 
of rules in order to protect the data and information not 
intended for publication. 
  By the same token, the appearance of press material that 
undoubtedly uses data from the aforementioned category requires 
investigation at the level of all state institutions where such 
leaks might occur. The SRI is directly responsible only for its 
own violations from the rules governing the circulation of data 
and information that constitute a state secret and are not meant 
for publication.

<F P=106> [Interviews with politicians by Radio Observator on the 6 </F>
March government reshuffle; place and date not given: "A 
Government Reshuffle, But It Comes to the Same Thing"] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  Petre Roman, president of the Democratic Party 
(National Salvation Front) [PD-FSN]: "One Third of the Current 
Government Has Not Been Validated" </H3>
  [Radio Observator] What do you think about the government 
reshuffle? 
  [Roman] No one can argue a government's right to seek to 
improve its work, including by cabinet reshuffle. However, the 
way it was done gives rise to concern and even disappointment. 
  [Radio Observator] What are you referring to? 
  [Roman] First, I am referring to the fact that the result of 
this reshuffle, after the one a few months ago, done in the same 
manner, is that one third of the current government consists of 
people who have not been confirmed by Parliament. Reshuffles 
made by ignoring parliament are to the detriment of democracy 
and the Constitution. Once again we note that the Constitution 
is observed only when it is convenient. When it is not 
convenient, then it can be violated. 
  This situation causes concern. Second, there is the 
inevitable question: How does this sudden and inexplicable 
reshuffle concur with sitting down at the negotiating table with 
the political forces within the opposition? It shows the 
mistrust with which efforts are made to achieve a political 
consensus in order to get out of the economic and social 
blockage and launch economic recovery. 
  Here there is both concern and disappointment. And there is 
a certain disappointment with the removal of Lieutenant General 
Niculae Spiroiu, the man who assumed the risk and, at the same 
time, the very difficult duty to modernize the military defense 
system of establishing the military hierarchy on the principles 
of competence and reform, so as to move the Romanian Army as 
close as possible to NATO structures. 
  These are the questions raised in connection with this 
reshuffle. 
  [Radio Observator] To go back to what you said before, I 
understand you are disappointed because you are convinced that, 
while the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] was 
conferring with you, the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian 
Democratic Party] and the PSDR [Social Democratic Party of 
Romania], the government decided on the reshuffle and thus, the 
talks with you were, in a way, conducted on a parallel level, 
this being known to the PDSR. 
  [Roman] The risk is that these talks, which we view as 
fundamental and involving great responsibility, namely to get 
out of our impasse and blockage, now seem like a facade. 
  [Radio Observator] Do you think that there is any use 
continuomg the dialogue? 
  [Roman] I think we have an obligation to maintain the idea 
of a dialogue, but the way it is to take place has to be 
discussed. In this respect, I first want to consult my party 
colleagues and maybe also other political forces within the 
opposition to try to clarify why this happened, which, indeed, 
may obscure exactly what seems a ray of light in this ever 
darker period in the Romanian nation's existence. 
<H3>  Ion Solcanu, PDSR senator: "This Is Not a Pro-Forma 
Reshuffle" </H3>
  [Radio Observator] The cabinet reshuffle has earned a lot of 
criticism. Is it justified? 
  [Solcanu] You see, the presence of the two civilian figures 
at the helm of the Ministries of Interior and National Defense 
very well correspond to the recommendations made to Romania and 
this aspect also is part of the reform. From this angle, I 
could say that it surely was not a pro-forma reshuffle. To 
replace four important ministers does not mean a pro-forma 
reshuffle and the presence of only one minister coming from our 
party does not mean a consolidation of our party in the 
government team. 
  [Radio Observator] Does this government reshuffle, at a time 
when the PDSR was holding talks with the other political forces, 
not compromise the negotiations with those forces? 
  [Solcanu] I do not think the problem can be posed this way 
and I will tell you why. During our talks with the parties, 
both with the PD(FSN), Mr. Sergiu Cunescu's PSDR [Social 
Democratic Party of Romania], and with the PNTCD [National 
Peasant Christian Democratic Party], we explained that, although 
discussed as a problem, the objective of parliamentary majority 
is a question of the more distant future that should not be 
forced. 
  [Radio Observator] And a last question: Are the four newly 
appointed ministers going to be confirmed by parliament? 
  [Solcanu] Regulations do not provide for this. The 
government reshuffle is decided by the president on the proposal 
of the prime minister. The complete government team is 
confirmed by parliament when the government program is voted on 
and passed. Thus, this is another reshuffle and it is 
absolutely constitutional. 

<H3>    Gheorghe Funar, president of the Romanian National 
Unity Party [PUNR]: "We Will Support the Government If the 
Protocol Is Respected" </H3>
  [Radio Observator] Ion Diaconescu, vice president of the 
PNTCD, said at one point that the government reshuffle was done 
on purpose in order not to anger the allies of the government 
party. What is your opinion in this respect, Mr. Funar? 
  [Funar] Since there have only been replacements in four of 
the ministries where the PUNR also wanted a change of ministers, 
we hope that, from the point of view of the PUNR, this reshuffle 
will be much more comprehensive and will include at least 
three-four other ministries. 
  [Radio Observator] That is what I wanted to hear because, in 
fact, this reshuffle does not include the ministries that are 
involved in the reform process. Does this not disappoint you? 
  [Funar] We are not talking of disappointment. The 
discussions held with those who are leading the PDSR prompted 
the idea that in a future stage -- and we hope that it will not 
be too long -- there will be modifications in other ministries 
too, leading finally to a much more solid government team, 
including reshuffles at the ministries you referred to, the ones 
that are much more directly involved in the reform. 
  [Radio Observator] Well, but does the way things have 
developed not suggest, by any chance, that a future reshuffle 
would also be within the PDSR? 
  [Funar] This is also possible on condition that competent 
people are found and accept such positions as minister. Maybe 
some of them will not belong to the PDSR, but will be 
independent, just as the prime minister is; maybe they will be 
liked by the PUNR as well. 
  [Radio Observator] Mr. Funar, some observers believe that 
the PDSR is trying to strengthen its position as a single party. 
Under what conditions and how are you going to act toward the 
PDSR? 
  [Funar] I think this is a much more theoretical remark. The 
PDSR will not be able to achieve a higher percentage than that 
achieved in the elections or greater support, for that matter, 
except through negotiations with other political formations 
within the so-called government arc, which has supported the 
Vacaroiu government so far, or within the opposition. 
  [Radio Observator] Well, but these negotiations will be 
broached from a different position, because, as has been proved 
twice -- in August and now -- the reshuffle can be performed 
under one's own steam. 
  [Funar] This is possible any time but it is not enough for 
the PDSR. It needs the support of the team, particularly in 
parliament. 
  [Radio Observator] And you will continue to grant this 
support? 
  [Funar] For the time being, this support will continue, 
provided the provisions of the protocol concluded with the PDSR 
are applied. 
<H3>  Romanian President Ion Iliescu: "Before Talking About a New 
Coalition, We Have To Achieve a Common Platform of Understanding" </H3>
  [Radio Observator] Do you think that in the future, let's 
say by fall, it will be possible to form a government, including 
the opposition? 
  [Iliescu] This is another question altogether. It requires 
different steps to achieve a viable platform for a larger and 
united government team. It would not be bad to achieve such a 
thing. I have always been frank and have sought this. We have 
had such a coalition government: the Stolojan government. You 
may recall that in 1990, after the first elections, I made such 
proposals, irrespective of the fact that there was a party 
holding parliamentary majority. Even at that time I said that 
it would be useful to create a broad coalition. This idea was 
rejected at that time. Then the Stolojan coalition government 
was formed. I can say that it was an interesting and useful 
political experiment. Such a coalition would be welcome 
especially today when we do not have a majority party. This, 
however, requires a better atmosphere and platform. I want to 
see how the second round of talks is going to conclude. During 
the first round I held talks with party representatives. Now 
the second round is being held between parties, that is between 
the ruling party and the other parties from all political 
spectrums -- both from the left and the right, although this 
delineation is relative. This time around our talks may yield 
results. What I mean is that before talking about a government 
coalition we have to achieve a platform of common understanding 
that may facilitate such a coalition. 
<H3>  Teodor Mohora, vice president of the Socialist Party of 
Labor [PSM]: "We Are a Party on the Rise" </H3>
  [Radio Observator] I would like to quote one of your 
statements: "I believe that, with the current reshuffle, the 
work of this government cannot change radically. What really 
needs reshuffling is the way the entire cabinet acts and is 
involved in solving our economic and social problems." 
  [Mohora] This comment starts out from an observation that 
may be different from that of the government and ruling party. 
We, the PSM leadership, are participating in our party's county 
conferences and I can say that we have the opportunity -- in 
direct discussions with the people -- to realize that the 
country is experiencing a difficult economic and social 
situation, which has been generated by the government's 
inconsistent and incoherent actions. 
  Thus, we think that, without reconsidering the cabinet 
program and work style, this government reshuffle will not yield 
spectacular results, even if, let us say, the people who 
appointed to government positions are competent people who could 
make an increased contribution to coordinating the respective 
fields. 
  [Radio Observator] From your party's point of view, what 
direction will the talks take? 
  [Mohora] During the talks, we said clearly that we wanted to 
discuss the country's basic problems, and, of course, those of 
the government. Thus, in view of the PSM's chance of having 
access to the government, we are interested in the government 
program. In any case, what we are interested in is to clearly 
settle the relations we will continue to maintain with the 
ruling party and government through a political understanding. 
For, as you well know, since the elections of September 1992 
our situation is a paradoxical one -- and that applies not only 
to us, to our party. As a matter of fact, four parties other 
than the PDSR support a government, without a clear political 
understanding, as the provisions of the Constitution actually 
prove. 
  [Radio Observator] A last question. There is a lot of talk 
about early elections, and some people are even stirring up this 
issue like a sort of scarecrow. What is the PSM's position in 
this respect? 
  [Mohora] We think it is not positive to force early 
elections this year because we are experiencing an extremely 
difficult economic period. New elections could cost us precious 
time and a lot of money. Certainly, you might think we are 
hypocrites to see us fiercely oppose early elections, because, 
as you know, we are a party on the rise and in the event of 
elections, if there are early elections, we will win an 
increased number of mandates. 
  We are thinking, however, of the situation in our country, 
that is, of the national interest, which, we believe, does not 
need early elections. 
<H3>  Ion Diaconescu, vice president of the National Peasant 
Christian Democratic Party [PNTCD]: "The Balance of Political 
Forces in Romania Has Not Changed at all" </H3>
  [Radio Observator] Do you believe this was a genuine 
government reshuffle or just a pro-forma one? 
  [Diaconescu] It has certainly been a reshuffle, but it was 
not the reshuffle expected by the public. The public wants a 
different government; in fact, this is actually the same 
government, spruced up with two or three technocrats, who, in 
fact, are also leaning toward the PDSR. Seen in this light, I 
believe that absolutely nothing has changed in the balance of 
political forces in our country, something that spares us the 
effort to think of a reorientation from this point of view. We 
are faced with the same situation, thus we may continue the same 
position. What shocked me, however, was the fact that General 
Spiroiu was replaced at this time when he is involved in a 
scandal with Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor [leader of Greater 
Romania Party]. The fact that he was replaced now makes one 
believe that President Iliescu was favoring Vadim Tudor given 
the fact that he was warned of measures against him, but 
continues to hold his former position, while General Spiroiu was 
replaced. 
  [Radio Observator] Why should he not favor General Spiroiu? 
After all he has been appointed ambassador to NATO in Brussels? 
  [Diaconescu] I think the position of ambassador to NATO in 
Brussels is lower than the position of minister of defense. I 
think that the ambassador in Brussels is subordinated to the 
Ministry of Defense. 
  [Radio Observator] Do you think that thus the demand by 
smaller and allied parties, namely to remove General Spiroiu, 
was met, a demand that constituted a condition for even 
participating in the negotiations?! 
  [Diaconescu] Maybe. The fact that the replaced ministers 
are, generally speaking, ministers who, of late, gave reasons 
for lots of discussions, rightly or wrongly, proves that in 
Spiroiu's case only this aspect was taken into account. The 
government continues to be a monocolor government and the change 
has taken place in such a way that former allies, who, of 
course, will continue to be the allies of the ruling party, are 
not angered. 
  [Radio Observator] How do you explain the fact that none of 
the portfolios whose holders have been replaced are in the 
economic area; thus the Vacaroiu government's economic line has 
not changed. If we are talking of change, should we not have 
expected something else, given the country's economic plight? 
  [Diaconescu] That is correct. It means that the government 
thinks that the line it has pursued so far is a positive one, 
all the government achievements are positive; but I want to ask 
you: How do you explain the current situation? It constantly 
wants to make the public believe that this whole economic 
disaster is a matter of fate, without no responsibility falling 
on the political leadership in our country, that it has not made 
any mistakes and can thus continue the same way.

  [Excerpt] On 15 March, Hungary's national day, during the 
time reserved for the members of the Chamber of Deputies to make 
personal speeches, Mr. Imre Borbely, UDMR [Democratic Union of 
Hungarians in Romania] deputy, marked that holiday and intended 
to present the essence of his statement speaking in the 
Hungarian language. His initiative was received with protests 
on behalf of the members of the Chamber of Deputies and thus the 
chairman of the session, Mr. Radu Berceanu, requested that in 
the Romanian parliament Mr. Borbely should use the language of 
the state of which he is a citizen. Despite this the UDMR 
deputy, according to his own statement, still addressed the 
chamber with a few words of greeting in Hungarian. 
  In their replies, independent Deputy Petre Turlea and 
Constantin Ciurtin, a PUNR [Romanian National Unity Party] 
deputy, protested the idea of celebrating the Hungarians' 
national day on Romania's soil, considering especially the fact 
that the UDMR leaders uphold the autonomy of the regions with a 
majority ethnic Hungarian population, a fact that violates 
Romania's Constitution. 
  The information bulletin published by the UDMR press bureau, 
which we received last night via fax, terms the occurrence in 
the Chamber of Deputies as a regrettable incident, as the UDMR 
deputy was prevented from uttering a few words in the Hungarian 
language. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Veronika Seyr from Skopje] </F>
  [Text] The disputed Alexander flag defies the stiff Balkan 
winds -- Krivulak, the largest firing range of the former 
Yugoslav People's Army [JNA], is now deserted and waiting for 
new occupants. Krivulak is located in the strategically most 
important location in the Balkans, at the bottleneck of the 
Vardar Valley. With 10,000 recruits, without any heavy weapons, 
and without a defense budget, the young state of Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] can put the 
valley to less use than the farmers who live in the vicinity. 
During maneuvers up to 5,000 JNA soldiers used to camp here. 
  [Begin recording of Major Stanko Sokolovski of the FYROM 
Army] Here in Krivulak the Yugoslav -- excuse me, Macedonian -- 
infantry gets its final polish. [end recording] 
  The major still has problems with the new conditions. 
  [Begin Sokolovski recording] About a month ago a unit of the 
U.S. UN battalion held firing exercises here. [end recording] 
  This might become a permanent state of affairs, because 
there 
are constant media reports that Krivulak might become the base 
for 3,000 to 5,000 Americans. For the time being the U.S. 
UNPROFOR contingent will be increased by 400 to 700 men. The 
United States seems to want to make Macedonia a calm pole of the 
Balkans with its presence. 
  After Albania, should Macedonia, which is located at the 
crossroads of interests in this region, also be firmly taken 
into U.S. hands? 
  The defense minister in Skopje naturally denies this. 
  [Begin recording Defense Minister Vlado Popovski] This idea 
of stationing 4,000, 5,000, or 7,000 Americans in Krivulak 
exists only in the press. It was launched by the Greeks. 
Serbian newspapers took it over, then it was taken over by 
Bulgarian papers, or the other way round. However, it is clear: 
Macedonia is located in an unstable region. The war in Bosnia 
is not over, and there is the risk that it might spread. 
Kosovo, too, worries us very much. We are threatened by all 
military activities. [end recording] 
  The Swedish UN soldiers have the longest experience with 
this 
kind of coexistence. They have been sharing a barracks in 
Kumanovo with the Macedonian Army for two years now.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Autonomy for Pirin Macedonia"] </F>
  [Text] The leader of the Macedonian organization OMO 
Ilenden in Bulgaria Jordan Kostadinov stated during the press 
conference for the agency BALKAN his organization's demand for a 
status of an autonomous region of Pirin Macedonia. He claims 
Bulgaria is forcibly assimilating the Macedonians by not 
acknowledging their language and by physical and moral violence 
by the authorities, which is a kind of a genocide. He added 
claims that Macedonians are in fact Bulgarians is a war 
propaganda, since 75 percent of the population in Pirin 
Macedonia have a sense of belonging to the Macedonian nation. 
  Kostadinov demanded introducing the Macedonian language in 
the schools and Macedonian nation as a category in the passport 
and diplomas. In addition, he insists on separation of the 
Nevrokop diocese of a metropolitan from the Bulgarian Church and 
appointing a Macedonian metropolitan. He also demands the 
Macedonian autonomous region to have a crowned lion in its 
symbol and a sun on its flag.

<F P=106> [Article by "I.B.": "Refugees Returning Home Soon?"] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb -- Since the beginning of the war, 680,000 
citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina have been forced to leave their 
homes. Refugees were given shelter by as many as 111 countries 
and the largest refugee groups of 10,000 people are accommodated 
in Germany, Turkey, France, and Austria. Arif Smajkic, minister 
of refugees, labor, and social welfare in the Government of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, presented the data at the press 
conference held yesterday at the Embassy of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
"The figure of 680,000 refugees does not include refugees from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina accommodated in Croatia. Exact information 
about the number of Bosnia-Herzegovinan citizens that are still 
in Croatia has not yet been gathered. About 70 percent of the 
total number of refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina are Muslims, 
there are less Croats, and a large number of Serbs found shelter 
in refugee camps in Western countries," said Smajkic. 
  Before coming to Zagreb, where he will talk to Minister Ivan 
Parac and Adalbert Rebic, Minister Smajkic visited many Western 
European countries and learnt about the status of refugees and 
workers staying in those countries. "The accommodation, status, 
and care of refugees in host countries is satisfactory," said 
Smajkic. Furthermore, he said that he met with representatives 
of international humanitarian organizations in Geneva and that 
they presented many programs for the return of refugees. Before 
the end of April, the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina will 
propose several models for the return of refugees, and it can be 
expected that Bosnia-Herzegovinan citizens will soon start 
returning to their homes. 
  Smajkic said that most refugees accommodated in Western 
countries have welcomed the Croat-Muslim Washington agreement. 
People will most probably first be able to go back to 
Herzegovina and central Bosnia, and their return will be 
financed by their host countries, international humanitarian 
organizations, the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development, and various funds. Wounded people, medical 
workers, engineers, and technicians, i.e., professional people 
important for the rebuilding of the country, will go back first. 
Large groups of refugees will go back only after accommodation 
and jobs have been secured for them. 
  Yesterday, Minister Smajkic visited the "Kruge" refugee 
center in Zagreb in which, as he said, living conditions, 
especially hygiene conditions, are satisfactory.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Darko Plevnik: "Tudjman and Tito"] </F>
  [Text] At the recent meeting of the Croatian Democratic 
Community [HDZ] "Main Lodge," [Croatian President] Tudjman 
demonstrated enthusiasm about the enormous acceleration of 
historic events and said that, for him, it had seemed like 
several decades, rather than just four years. Since he did not 
specify the direction of those decades that were passing so 
quickly, judging by the war and the decline of the standard of 
living, Croatia went 40 years back, rather than forward. The 
debate about whether Croatia went back to 1941 or to 1945 has 
been going on for four years. According to sporadic neo-ustashi 
folklore study and the study of ornaments, some tend to claim 
that Tudjman is closer to Pavelic [Croatian politician, founder 
of the the Independent State of Croatia -- NDH -- in 1941] and 
the NDH than to Tito and the Socialist Republic of Croatia. One 
could find many similies to substantiate this topic -- formally. 
However, in order to make a convincing material analysis, one 
should better consider a meaningful comparison of the way of 
production of the postwar Tito's society and (post)war Tudjman's 
society. With regard to that, one could consider the category 
of a law-ordered state. Legally speaking, the NDH was more of a 
law-ordered state than the Croatia of the present day. How 
come? It had monstrous, disgusting, racist laws, but its legal 
proceedings were more or less governed in accordance with them. 
Tudjman's Republic of Croatia does not have a legal basis for 
harassing the Serbs, but rather "the best Constitution in the 
world for ethnic communities and national minorities," but it 
does not go by it in most cases. 
<H5>  Constitution and Rights </H5>
  Such an approach to legislature and regulations was the most 
distinguishable trait of communists countries. Just as 
communists made laws to comply with international political good 
manners, so did Glavas [head of Osijek county], at one point, 
with regard to defining the national and human rights of the 
Serbs, say the Croatian Constitution was just a "piece of 
paper." In distinction to the ustashas, to whom Hitler gave the 
"revolution" of indulging themselves with the citizens of 
Croatia, the members of the HDZ won the right to overthrow the 
state themselves. If the communist revolution carried out in 
the defensive antifascist war ended by harassing the former 
enemy, the NDH, the HDZ revolution was also realized in the 
defensive patriotic war by stigmatizing the participants of 
former inimical Yugoslavia. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia 
organized the uprising against the occupying German army [in 
World War II], and the HDZ did so against the occupying JNA 
[Yugoslav Peoples Army], and thus, after the victories, the 
communists remained the only official antifascists and the HDZ 
members the only official volunteers. 
  Just as Tito asked that chetniks who did not commit "too 
many" crimes join the partisans, Tudjman asked them to join the 
Croatian Army. Tito was teaching that agitation and propaganda 
was the best means of forcing people to suffer their own damage; 
Tudjman does that by increasing the propaganda for Croatian 
national awareness. In diplomatic sequestration, Tito kept 
Trieste and parts of Istria, Tudjman got "krajina." In the 
postwar years, the USSR played a role of the magic guarantee for 
a better future for communists, and now HDZ members think the 
Unites States plays a comparable role. The cults of both Tito 
and Tudjman were created by means of the monopolized media and 
claques. But, just as legal development of Tito's cult deviated 
from norms of realist socialism and contributed to the 
imposition of sanctions by socialist countries (the Cominform 
resolution), the development of Tudjman's cult resulted in 
deviations from European norms, which almost lead to the 
imposition of sanctions (UN resolutions). 
  Both regimes rely upon a powerful party -- the state in the 
context of the geopolitically maximum possible political 
pluralism. At that time, being expelled from the Communist Party 
of Yugoslavia resulted in an immediate loss of official 
function; today the same is happening to people expelled from 
the HDZ. The division of people is executed according to similar 
propagandistic patterns. People are either for Tito's Yugoslavia 
or they are traitors who advocate Croatia, i.e., those who want 
Tudjman's Croatia and traitors who are also inclined toward 
Istria, Dalmatia, Slavonia.... Both authorities awarded 
memorial medals and ideologized, politicized, and ascribed state 
success to their party. What once meant the loss of political, 
civic rights is today the loss of certificates of citizenship 
and the pertaining rights. After the communist antifascist war 
there was class differentiation, and during the HDZ antifascist 
war ethnic differentiation pays the tribute. One is 
particularly beware of "internal enemies" who are likely to 
conspire with the "external enemy" -- a constant danger for the 
young state. 

<H5>    Watching for the Enemy </H5>
  Therefore, protecting its existence justifies all means, so 
Tudjman's enforcement of taxes is a counterpart to Tito's 
enforcement of purchases, and Tudjman's (in)humane moving people 
from their land is a counterpart to Tito's colonization of other 
people's property. One-time forceful collectivization is, today, 
replaced with forceful privatization, and the politics of doing 
away with kulaks, with the politics of expropriating workers. 
Farmers and the middle class paid for the development of the 
"Yugoslav working class," workers and the middle class have paid 
for the development of the "Croatian class." The former regime 
forced the mobilization of the work force, and now the work 
force is being mobilized. Farmers made the biggest contribution 
to the communist revolution and, in the HDZ revolution, the 
greatest victims are proletarians -- owners of their joblessness. 
  Centralization is a characteristic of both ways of ruling. 
However, already in 1945, the communists passed the law on the 
final liquidation of farmers' debts, which was the death of 
farmers in the old Yugoslavia. In addition to centralization, 
HDZ members incurred debts for the population: They took 
foreign currency from the rich and asked the poor to buy their 
own apartments (which they acquired on the basis of the public 
ownership in which they partook financially), their own firms, 
and to reduce health and retirement benefits. And just as in 
the communist regime, farmers only had the right to minimal 
ownership (their own land), it was not used optimally without 
realistic market conditions; today, maximum private 
entrepreneurship without market freedom is equally ridiculous, 
since it is for the most part mediated by the state, instead of 
the market Privatization Fund, and has connections with the HDZ 
discretionary power. 
<H5>  "Kulaks" and "Commies" </H5>
  If it was once easy to change from sandals to shoes, today 
one can change from shoes to a BMW even faster. But those who 
lose awareness from the Croatianist patriotic conscience are not 
getting BMW's, just as those who lost awareness from the 
communist shock-worker awareness got very little. "Unaware 
peasants" used to suffer a lot under the pressure of state 
tutors if they contributed too little to the state; today, 
"unaware intellectuals" suffer the same kind of pressure, for 
they are not creating enough contributions for the statesman. 
The Communist Party of Yugoslavia "became famous" for its 
pressure on kulaks to "voluntarily" join peasants' work 
communities, and the HDZ for its pressure on "social managers" 
and speculators to join the HDZ, threatening that if they refuse 
they would either be replaced or have to pay higher taxes. 
Local communist authorities used to let off steam politically 
abusing work mobilization, while the aphrodisiac of the HDZ 
authorities is the abuse of military mobilization. Even greater 
pleasure is derived from "unknown men" mistreating "NDH kulaks" 
who refuse to obey work mobilization, i.e., "Yugo-commies" who 
refuse to wear the uniform of the Croatian Army. 
  The leadership of the HDZ is aware of all those 
irregularities, just as the Politburo of the Communist Party of 
Yugoslavia was. Tito also knew what Tudjman knows today. And 
what does Tudjman know about Tito today? He knows that Tito is 
a much greater geopolitical and international reference for him 
than Pavelic. Having finally paid off the Pavelic-like 
ideological mortgage, in his conversation with Albanian 
President Berisha, he made a wise reference to Tito, as a 
Croatian politician and statesman. Has Tudjman finally 
surpassed his revolutionary Titoist stage and approached a much 
more civilized Tito from 1974? Anyway, in interethnic and 
international relations, Tudjman should also follow Tito's 
"non-Mandarin" strategic experience. If Tudjman has a strong 
reason to draw his geopolitical thoughts from the positive and 
acclaimed achievements of Titoism, he also has reason to 
democratically dignify it by spreading his tolerance to his 
critics. One could not publish a similar (ana)logical text in 
the postwar Tito regime, but the mere act of writing alone could 
incur an invitation for a "tourist tour" from Goli Otok [island 
in the Adriatic Sea turned into a prison, mainly for political 
prisoners] to Lepoglava [prison for political prisoners]. One 
can say what one thinks about Tudjman -- even when one does not 
think -- without fear. Without fear of being imprisoned. 
Indeed, ambitious people only fear stagnation in their careers. 
Is a new Tito the "Tudjman" who democratically came to his 
senses and accepted the pluralistic public, or is Tudjman the 
old "Tito" who ended his crypto-Croatian strategy on the basis 
of the verified intraparty rough treatment of his followers? 
  All this needs to be critically examined in great detail. 
The criticism of the Croatian state could, therefore, also 
consist of its development, instead of the denial of both the 
state and the criticism. The worst critical state is better 
than the best state criticism, so the state and its critics 
should agree that statesmen deal in politics and critics in 
criticism, to the market satisfaction of their clients. What 
kind of political market is it where politicians always "take 
care" of critics?

  [Editorial Report] Bratislava STV 1 Television Network in 
Slovak at 2105 GMT on 15 March carries in place of its usual 
"Press Club" program a 60-minute program entitled "May We Enter, 
President?," which is usually scheduled for other days. The 
program consists of a live discussion between President Michal 
Kovac and journalists Marian Lesko and Ivan Horsky. The 
anchorman is not identified. 
  The first 40 minutes are devoted to a discussion of the 
president's report on the state of the country presented to 
parliament on 9 March and Meciar's speech in parliament on 11 
March. The president agreed that reactions to his report may 
vary. This was the first ever report of its kind, and he tried 
his best to present the real state of affairs. The president 
then quotes some parts of his report to show that former Prime 
Minister Meciar misinterpreted him in his speech. The president 
also responds to other accusations made by former Prime Minister 
Meciar in the past. 
  After that, all three participants speculate on whether any 
government other than that of Meciar could have done better. 
One of the journalists opines that too much power became 
concentrated in the hands of one or two politicians. The 
president then recalls the history of his views on the need for 
a government of a broad coalition as well as his talks with 
Prime Minister Meciar related to this issue. He points out the 
danger of one or two people holding power and being 
indispensable to the nation. He expresses his belief in the 
possibility of a broad coalition of several parties because 
their programs do not differ too much. According to him, this 
coalition is possible on the condition that the politicians 
involved are personalities who are able to cooperate. Asked 
about the names of the nominees for ministerial posts, the 
president declines to make them public. 
  Answering a question on what the future government can 
achieve before the next elections, the president says: "I think 
we are aware that, first of all, it is necessary to create a 
calm atmosphere in society, a calm atmosphere in parliament, and 
good conditions for the work of the government. 
  "Second, we have to realize that this is a temporary 
government, a government for a certain period. Assuming that 
the elections will be held in September or October, the 
government will work until then. Every realistic person knows 
what can be achieved in this time." 
  The president also says that it will be necessary to deal 
with the memorandum signed between the previous government and 
the IMF. "It will be necessary to continue some talks. It will 
be necessary to say quite unambiguously which policies the 
government will continue to pursue and to give a signal both 
abroad and at home that the transformation process will 
continue. The process of developing democratic institutions and 
creating conditions for our gradual integration into West 
European structures will continue as well. It will be necessary 
to express and confirm again our policy toward neighboring 
countries, to confirm our foreign policy priorities. Most of 
all, in cooperation with the trade unions, the Association of 
Employers Unions, and the others, we need to rethink the 
inevitable measures to stop some negative phenomena in the 
economy. We have information that the ministries are, I would 
not want to call it a disarray, but they certainly are not in 
good shape. They are not quite prepared for peaceful work. 
Therefore, as far as the work of state bodies is concerned, we 
need to take steps in the personnel sphere. We need to give 
people security." 
  At the end of the program, the president appeals to the 
citizens to reassess their behavior in connection with the 
incidents in which journalists were beaten up. 
  A journalist asks him: "Certain things happened in the 
streets of Bratislava yesterday. Four journalists were beaten 
up. Deputies of ethnic Hungarian parties were attacked the day 
before. What is your view of these things?" 
  Kovac replies: "This is obviously aimed at making the 
president fed up with the situation inasmuch as all this was 
happening right under my windows. It is very difficult to work 
under such circumstances. However, I would like to say to those 
of our citizens who frequent these places that they will not 
discourage me. They will not force me to resign. On the 
contrary, this encourages me to hold out. I am ready to go on 
persuading these groups of citizens as well. 
  "Still, I would like to appeal to them as well as to other 
citizens and say to them that, if their goal is to distress the 
president, their effort is in vain. They will not succeed in 
achieving that. 
  "However, in order not to damage the good name of the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], not to harm the HZDS 
chairman [Vladimir Meciar], and not to be a disgrace to the 
country, they should really try to show both to our people and 
to foreign journalists that we are a civilized nation, and they 
should reconsider the culture of their behaviour. They should 
realize that we have certain mechanisms and constitutional 
institutions through which a citizen can express his or her 
will. Elections are one of these institutions. In elections, 
people can really express their liking for one politician or 
another. 
  "I would also like to ask for something else. I do not 
understand why love, respect, trust, and liking for one 
politician is linked to hatred for another politician. Why do 
they have to show disrespect to the president merely because 
they like Mr. Meciar? There is nothing wrong with their liking 
Mr. Meciar. I am glad to see that we have people who respect 
our politicians. However, this does not mean that they have to 
hate the president or other politicians who have different 
views. In my opinion, all of this should be taken into account 
by both the HZDS chairman and other officials of the HZDS. 
Perhaps they have the opportunity or the influence to address 
these citizens and to ask them for a better political culture."

<F P=106> [Article by REPUBLIKA: "Movement for a Democratic Slovakia </F>
Deputies to the Former CSFR Federal Assembly: President Is 
Calling in Question the Will of Citizens"] 
  [Text] Spisska Nova Ves--Aware of our decisive measure of 
responsibility for the founding of the Slovak Republic, we, 
deputies to the former Federal Assembly for the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] elected in the 1992 elections, issue 
the following statement on the current situation in society: 
  Our young Slovak Republic has arrived at a fateful 
crossroads. This happened on the basis of a carefully thought 
out and systematic course of action by the president of the 
Slovak Republic, who, by his address in the National Council of 
the Slovak Republic, initiated the process of destabilizing the 
Slovak political scene and a parliamentary crisis, whose outcome 
is the negation of the results of free and democratic elections. 
By this unprecedented action, which is without parallel in the 
history of European parliamentarianism, he exceeded the 
framework of his constitutional powers. As a result, the 
further development of our society is getting into the hands of 
political entities that did not vote for the Constitution and 
sovereignty and that were never favorably disposed toward the 
founding of an independent Slovak Republic. This development 
fills us with serious concern. We follow with the same concern 
the endeavor by the president of the Slovak Republic to call in 
question the will of citizens as expressed in their exercising 
the right of petition. 
  While we acknowledge the undeniable contribution made by 
Michal Kovac, president of the Slovak Republic, to the founding 
of the Slovak Republic, we feel the moral obligation and 
justification, obtained by the law on the termination of the 
federation, to appeal to the president's conscience to consider 
whether his remaining in the post of president of the Slovak 
Republic is in conformity with the interests of the Slovak 
Republic.

  [Text] When assessing the political situation in the wake 
of the no-confidence vote in Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir 
Meciar in his interview for Slovak Television on Saturday [12 
March], President Michal Kovac told television viewers: "We are 
in a democratic state, and a decision made by the majority is 
thus valid." He asserted, furthermore, that "this certainly does 
not mean any black mark against parliament in the eyes of our 
public." If the deputies and the president himself were 
convinced about the correctness of this decision, they should 
have explained it in person to the voters who had assembled in 
front of parliament and the Primacialny Palace [temporary seat 
of Slovak president]. 
  Let me remind the president of the majority principle also 
regarding the assessment of his activity by deputies for the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] to the former CSFR 
Federal Assembly. He actively cooperated with these deputies 
for half a year, when dividing the federation. In a statement 
adopted on Saturday [12 March], the great majority of these 
deputies said that the Slovak president had destabilized the 
political scene, initiated a parliamentary crisis, and evidently 
exceeded the framework of his constitutional powers. Such 
action by a president is without precedent in the history of 
European parliamentarianism. Supported by mandates received from 
their voters, HZDS deputies to the former Federal Assembly 
appealed to the president's conscience to consider his remaining 
in the post of president. 
  How will the president react to the decision of this 
majority? A government without top political leaders is to be 
formed in the days to come. Let us apply that principle 
consistently. Also to the president.

  [Text] Tension in the Slovak Republic is growing. Our 
Bratislava correspondent, Renata Havranova, reports in detail: 
  [Havranova] Listeners who wanted to listen to a Radio Free 
Europe [RFE] newscast this morning could not find it on the 
airwaves. 
  Former Minister Hofbauer has implemented his threat, made 
after the editors of this radio station were savagely attacked 
outside the president's office, and withdrew the frequency of 
Radio Free Europe. This was confirmed to me this morning in a 
telephone conversation with (Otto Machac), administrator of the 
Bratislava Office of RFE. He said he had been warned of 
disconnection as early as Monday, but no one had officially 
informed him until now. Otto Machac added that the United 
States, as well as the Munich leadership of RFE, will protest 
against this step. 
  The behavior of the outgoing government is very strange. 
Roman Kovac confirmed to journalists last night that personnel 
purges are continuing at the ministries, privatization is under 
way, and certain property is being written off. 
  According to Roman Kovac, the first step of the new 
government, which has been complete since last night, will be to 
open investigations into these unlawful steps on the part of 
former Prime Minister Meciar and the other members of the former 
government.

  [Excerpts] The opposition has been very reluctant to take 
the step and express no confidence in Prime Minister Vladimir 
Meciar and his government. The watershed came with the speech 
delivered by President Michal Kovac, which tipped the scales. 
The unity of opposition was disturbed by the hesitation of the 
Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], which, until the very last 
moment, did not exclude cooperation with the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. This was stated by the vice chairman 
of the Coexistence [Egyutteles] Movement, Arpad Duka Zolyomi, 
whose statement continued to dominate today's press conference. 
Our radio was represented by Bernard Hornak, who invited 
Zolyomi to the microphone. 
  [Begin recording] [Hornak] According to a preliminary 
agreement of the former opposition parties, politicians 
representing the [ethnic] Hungarian parties in Slovakia will not 
appear in the new government. In spite of this, you do support 
the formation of the new government, which should consist of 
representatives of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], of 
the so-called center bloc, and of the Christian Democratic Party 
[KDH]. 
  [Zolyomi] I would like to return to the 26th session of the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic, where we learned that 
the emerging broader coalition did not count on our 
participation. Then we started to discuss under what conditions 
we were going to support this new government. We defined 
certain points, certain measures that could be taken in a joint 
effort with the government. These were very specific matters, 
out of which a more comprehensive concept was formulated. We 
therefore want to support this government, provided, of course, 
that it keeps to our agreement. In such a case, our requests or 
suggestions should appear in some form in the new government's 
program. 
  [Hornak] You mentioned the conditions. What are they? 
  [Zolyomi] They are concerned with specific matters related, 
for example, to the recommendations of the Council of Europe, 
which should put an end to matters that have been dragging on 
for almost a year. Then, certain questions relate to 
jurisdiction of local self-governing bodies, to an alternative 
educational system, and to the local administrative division. 
Naturally, this government, whose term of office will be 
limited, is probably not going to deal with this question in 
depth. [passage omitted]. A further matter to be dealt with is 
related to reorganizing and creating a new concept of the 
Council for Nationalities working within the framework of the 
Slovak Government and, in some way, the matter of minority 
representation in the civil service. [passage omitted] [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian </F>
Democratic Movement, by Jana Patsch in Bratislava; date not 
given: "Government of Experts"] 
  [Text] [Patsch] What will the government be like? 
  [Carnogursky] It will be a government of experts. No single 
party chairman is among them. For example, the new foreign 
minister has experience as a UN ambassador, and the new finance 
minister is a banking expert. 
  [Patsch] Will the alliance of the opposition, which has been 
so much at variance so far, hold? 
  [Carnogursky] There are, of course, different views within 
the government. But all know what is at stake. We have a joint 
objective.... 
  [Patsch] ...the elimination of Meciar? 
  [Carnogursky] Above all, the future of our country. 
Moreover, I believe that it might work better than many assume. 
Peter Weiss (chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left--SDL) 
is a man with whom one can have a reasonable talk. At any rate, 
I am optimistic. 
  [Patsch] How can early new elections be pushed through? 
  [Carnogursky] This is difficult because the Constitution 
does not provide for it. Basically, we are sticking to our 
point of view: new elections in September or October. We would 
need a three-fifths' majority for it. If Meciar rejects our 
proposal, we have to look for another way. It would be 
conceivable to ask the president to open the road to new 
elections by a referendum. It should contain only one question: 
early elections--yes or no? 
  [Patsch] A referendum has already been initiated by 
Meciar.... 
  [Carnogursky] ... which does not meet the requirements. 
Signatures turn up two and three times. There are names on the 
list that are not registered anywhere.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian </F>
Democratic Movement, by Jana Pankovcinova; place and date not 
given: "Meciar Did Not Convince Me"] 
  [Text] [Pankovcinova] How do you assess the prime 
minister's speech in the National Council of the Slovak Republic 
[NRSR], his offers regarding a solution to the domestic 
political situation, and his statement that he would be ready to 
step down one minute after the president does? 
  [Carnogursky] The speech was general and did not address 
those parts of the president's speech that described the 
actually existing negative features of Slovak politics. 
Moreover, he tried to give himself the air of someone who has 
been fighting for Slovak statehood since time immemorial. I, 
however, remember the meeting in the Vikarka restaurant [at 
Prague Castle] in January 1991, when he signed all points on the 
future constitutional setup submitted by President Vaclav Havel. 
The prime minister said that matters raised only in one-to-one 
conversations between himself and the president should not be 
made public. Yet this is exactly what he himself did last year 
with regard to his talks with Ludovit Cernak, the then chairman 
of the Slovak National Party [allusion to Meciar's claim that, 
in a private conversation, Cernak had asked for funds from the 
state budget for his party]. Vladimir Meciar simply did not 
convince me. As for his proposal that he will step down one 
minute after the president tenders his resignation, this is 
sheer demagoguery because, if the president of the Slovak 
Republic resigned, there would be no one to accept the prime 
minister's resignation. 
  [Pankovcinova] Olga Keltosova, minister of labor and social 
affairs, called on deputies on Thursday [10 March] to consider 
the possibilities arising from Article 106 of the Constitution 
of the Slovak Republic. This article deals with conditions 
under which the NRSR can recall the president.... 
  [Carnogursky] This was a display of demagoguery and 
arrogance because, by proposing a broad-coalition government, 
the president did not make himself guilty of anything 
[constituting grounds for impeachment] under Article 106 of the 
Constitution of the Slovak Republic. The very fact that a 
minister dares say anything of that sort about the president is 
brazen. 
  [Pankovcinova] How long will the formation of the coalition 
government last? 
  [Carnogursky] It cannot last long. The government must be 
formed within the next few days. 
  [Pankovcinova] Will you seek a change in the post of NRSR 
chairman? 
  [Carnogursky] I think that this issue will be topical. 
  [Pankovcinova] Are you personally interested in any 
government post? 
  [Carnogursky] No, it will be a government without party 
leaders. 
  [Pankovcinova] Which government departments does the 
Christian Democratic Movement intend to fill? 
  [Carnogursky] That is a matter for political parties to 
agree upon.

<F P=106> [Article by "ao": "Priority--Early Elections"] </F>
  [Text] Bratislava--The Saturday [12 March] meeting of the 
Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] Executive Committee started 
with an evaluation of the political situation and an assessment 
of the ability of the SDL district organizations in Povazska 
Bystrica and Ziar nad Hronom to act. The participants' main 
attention focused, however, on the development of the domestic 
political situation in Slovakia. 
  The Executive Committee approved the course of action by the 
SDL Presidium and the SDL Club of Deputies in the search for a 
way out of the political crisis. It continues to regard an 
agreement on calling early elections as the priority of the 
SDL's tactics so that the new cabinet's period of activity can 
be strictly defined. The Executive Committee authorized the SDL 
Presidium to conduct talks on the formation of a preelection 
coalition with the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia [SDSS], 
the Farmers Movement of the Slovak Republic, the Association of 
Workers of Slovakia, the Green Party in Slovakia, and other 
political entities, as well as on the formation of a provisional 
government. The SDL is interested in the new government having 
the greatest possible degree of continuity with the previous one. 
  At a meeting with reporters, SDL Chairman Peter Weiss said 
that he was opposed to the assumption of power by the new 
coalition being accompanied by politically expedient purges at 
various levels. As for posts in the Supreme Inspection Office 
[NKU] of the Slovak Republic, SDL Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik 
said that the NKU was the fourth institution of constitutional 
power. Changes in its leadership are essential, he said, 
precisely because the NKU chairman (from the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia) and the deputy chairmen (both from the 
Slovak National Party) did not act independently in their posts. 
  Responding to behind-the-scenes rumors about a lack of unity 
among SDL deputies to the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic, Peter Weiss said that their activity was determined by 
the president's [9 March] address to parliament and by the 
failure to enlist a sufficient number of deputies' votes to 
decide on a date for early elections before the dismissal of 
Prime Minister Meciar. Hence, the problem was not just to 
express no confidence in the prime minister, but to agree on a 
sequence of steps. However, the SDL Club of Deputies' decision 
of Friday [11 March] afternoon [to support the no-confidence 
vote in Meciar] was unanimous. Peter Weiss did not rule out the 
possibility that, apart from a broad coalition government, there 
could also be a cabinet formed by the SDL and the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia, naturally without Vladimir Meciar. As 
regards representatives of the Hungarian political parties, the 
SDL does not count on their direct participation in the 
formation of a provisional government.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Positions After Parliamentary Reshuffles; </F>
Changes in the National Council of the Slovak Republic Deputies' 
Clubs"] 
  [Text] The decision by parliament to pass a vote of 
no-confidence in Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar will, 
possibly, still in the course of the 27th meeting of the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR], trigger changes 
in the composition of deputies' clubs. 
  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] Chairman Vladimir 
Meciar, who did not exercise his mandate as a deputy in view of 
holding the post of Slovak prime minister, is likely to be the 
first to return to the parliamentary benches. He will replace 
Anna Korduliakova from Cadca, who, together with deputy Milan 
Mrenko, set up the HZDS National Social Democratic Faction. The 
Cadca HZDS District Presidium did not accept this initiative. 
  [Justice Minister] Katarina Tothova, [Labor and Social 
Affairs Minister] Olga Keltosova, [Deputy Prime Minister] Jozef 
Prokes, and [Deputy Prime Minister] Marian Andel also did not 
exercise their mandates as deputies while executing their 
[government] posts. Vladimir Mikulka from Ruzomberok, Blazena 
Pavlovicova from Skalica, Miroslav Rybansky from Piestany, and 
Milan Janicina from Bratislava, who subsequently joined Ludovit 
Cernak's National Democratic Club, had been co-opted into the 
NRSR in their stead. 
  At the start of the 10th electoral term [in June 1992], the 
HZDS had 74 deputies in the NRSR, the Party of the Democratic 
Left [SDL] 29, the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] 18, the 
Slovak National Party [SNS] 15, and the Hungarian Christian 
Democratic Movement/Coexistence [MKDH/Coexistence] coalition 14. 
  In the course of parliament's 10th electoral term, 19 
deputies have left the HZDS Deputies' Club, one has left the SDL 
Deputies' Club, and seven have left the SNS Deputies' Club. The 
KDH and MKDH/Coexistence clubs have remained unchanged. Until 
the NRSR meeting started, the correlation of votes between the 
HZDS/SNS government coalition on the one hand and opposition 
parties and independent deputies on the other was 74:76. In the 
course of the 27th NRSR meeting, Imrich Mori announced that he 
was leaving the HZDS, and eight signatories of the Alternative 
of Political Realism [platform within the HZDS] announced that 
they were leaving the HZDS Deputies' Club. This new balance of 
forces apparently decided on the passage of the no-confidence 
vote in the prime minister. 
  After the [former] Slovak Government members regain their 
mandates as NRSR deputies, the HZDS will have 52 seats in 
parliament and the SNS nine. The previously two independent 
deputies--Ivan Hudec and Peter Brnak--have been joined by 
others, following the departures from the HZDS and the SNS. 
Hence, the correlation of votes should be 65:85 in favor of 
independent deputies and political parties that will try, in the 
coming days, to form a government with a limited term of office, 
until early parliamentary elections.

<F P=106> [Article by "js": "Workers Have Their Own Party; Civic </F>
Association Transformed Into Political Party"] 
  [Text] Banska Bystrica--The Association of the Workers of 
Slovakia [Zdruzenie robotnikov Slovenska, ZRS] will contest the 
early parliamentary elections as an independent representative 
of the most numerous social layer of the population--workers and 
farmers. This was announced by ZRS Chairman Jan Luptak, deputy 
to the National Council of the Slovak Republic for the Party of 
the Democratic Left [SDL], in Banska Bystrica on Saturday [12 
March], immediately after delegates to the Third ZRS Assembly 
approved, by an absolute majority of votes, the transformation 
of the ZRS, which has until now been a civic association, into a 
political party. 
  The delegates confirmed Jan Luptak as chairman of this new 
left-wing party, which has 13,000 members. Jan Luptak stressed 
that, in a public opinion survey, as many as 85 percent of 1,264 
respondents said that they would support the ZRS with their vote 
in the coming parliamentary elections. According to Luptak, 
this optimistic election forecast is based on the fact that 
workers' interests have so far been represented by political 
parties only haphazardly and expediently, whereas the ZRS bases 
its program on a systematic solution to the problems of people 
who are the greatest victims of economic reform. After the 
elections, the new political party intends to cooperate with the 
SDL and the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia [SDSS] and 
plans, among other issues, to initiate changes to legislation 
that is, in the opinion of the ZRS, directed against workers. 
This concerns, in particular, the Labor Code and the Law on 
Wages and Supplementary Payments. Within a short period of 
time, the party will address its potential voters by its own 
weekly--HLAS ROBOTNIKOV [Workers' Voice]. Both the editorial 
staff and the ZRS central bodies will be headquartered in Banska 
Bystrica. 
  [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 14 March on page 2 
carries a 300-word TA SR report on the ZRS congress, which 
specifies that the "public opinion poll" referred to by Jan 
Luptak was organized by the ZRS itself and that it was conducted 
"chiefly among blue-collar workers."]

  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said at a news conference in 
Warsaw yesterday that he intends to visit Prague on Sunday. In 
this connection, our correspondent David Stahlavsky spoke to 
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus: 
  [Begin recording] [Stahlavsky] I have asked you about your 
views before. At the time, you expressed the belief that it 
would not occur to the Russian radical nationalist to visit the 
Czech Republic. It appears that it has occurred to him, but, 
above all, it occurred to the crowds close to the Association 
for the Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia. How will 
the leadership of our state react to this visit? What will our 
democracy have to hear before it behaves like other Western 
democracies--for example, in Germany and other places, where Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy was declared persona non grata? 
  [Klaus] Well, Mr. Zhirinovskiy is no doubt persona non grata 
in our country at the moment, but I am using the expression non 
grata in the general civic meaning. I am not using it as a 
technical term of international law. We do not want him here. 
It is in this sense that he is not desirable in our country, 
and the few Mr. Sladeks [head of the Republican Party] who want 
him here, well, I think they are again indicating clearly where 
he belongs and what we all are to think about him. 
  I am not fully convinced that we should proceed from 
undesirability, in the general sense of the word, to the term 
persona non grata, in the legal sense of the word, and formally 
bloc the arrival of Mr. Zhirinovskiy in our country. The 
government has not made any decision in principle about it, 
either. I do not rule out that it will become a topic of at 
least brief talks at the government session tomorrow morning. I 
really would not like to predetermine this matter. 
  I think it is a pity, a waste of time, and stupid. On the 
other hand, I am fully convinced that our democracy is strong 
enough to survive this visit in peace without being threatened 
in any way. [end recording]

  [Text] Interior Minister Jan Ruml spoke about the situation 
on the Czech-Slovak border following the culmination of the 
political crisis in Slovakia yesterday. Together with his 
departmental colleagues, he is attending a session at Plumlov, 
Prostejov district. 
  He said: 
  [Begin Ruml recording] As for the state border, naturally, 
the talks must be suspended at the moment because they have been 
transformed to the level of political talks, that is the level 
of two governments, two prime ministers. This means that the 
controversial points must be frozen. 
  The border should be delimited in the places where the 
border 
commission was capable of agreeing, and I assume that the next 
Slovak government will be interested in talking about these 
matters and that we will agree in the end on the two parts of 
the state border, above all for the benefit of the people. [end

  [Editorial Report] Prague Radiozurnal Radio Network in 
Czech at 1715 GMT on 15 March broadcast the regular Tuesday 
interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, prepared by 
correspondent David Stahlavsky. The program lasted 10 minutes. 
  Answering questions, the prime minister spoke about the 
general reasons for unemployment in Western countries, the 
allocation of privatization points by Czech people, and the 
agricultural policy as approved by the government recently. In 
this context, the prime minister said: 
  "I think that our merciless pressure to abolish 
protectionism 
in our exports, as well as lifting subsidies on Western exports 
of agricultural produce to our country, is producing certain 
results. When I was in Great Britain last week and then in 
Brussels, I had talks with both Mr. Delors and Mr. 
Christophersen, who is, so to speak, the European Union finance 
minister. They both indicated that the problem of not 
subsidizing the exports of agricultural products eastward is 
suddenly becoming an issue. Originally, this problem was not 
part of their vocabulary at all. This problem is now there, and 
they are becoming aware that something has to be done about it." 
  While giving his opinion on the implementation of the 
government's political program, the prime minister said: 
  "It would be a major institutional and political change if 
we 
established a senate in this country. This act or 
decisionmaking on this matter and the pace of this step are 
totally different, and I think it is useless to speed up 
anything in this matter. I will bet that those who are trying 
to speed up this process are doing so not because they are 
ignorant of the pace of political life, as I am trying to 
explain it here. They are not doing it because they think we 
could not do without a senate tomorrow or the day after. They 
are using this matter as political cards. They keep pulling out 
these cards, and that makes it possible for these political 
parties to say something more definite. They simply pull out a 
card, and, by doing so, they get media space, the papers, the 
radio, and so on. I cannot accept this. It is not possible to 
turn the territorial setup and the Senate into substitute 
problems that would be tackled at the cost of those problems 
that are much more urgent." 
  The last question concerned the granting of citizenship to 
former Czech aristocrats and the return of their property. The 
prime minister said he hoped that all aspects of this complex 
issue will have been taken into consideration when laws are 
adopted.

  [Excerpt] At noon today, Trade and Industry Minister 
Vladimir Dlouhy took part in talks held by the Left Bloc 
deputies' group, which were open to the public. 
  Milan Repka has phoned in the following report: 
  [begin recording] [Repka] Vladimir Dlouhy said at this 
meeting that, thanks to the [European Union] association 
agreement, Czech exports reached 15-20 percent [as heard] in 
1993. 
  As for the Slovak Republic, there was a reduction in the 
volume of reciprocal trade by about 20 percent in the first half 
of 1993, and reciprocal trade stagnated at this level in the 
second half of 1993. 
  Asked by Zdenek Vorlicek, a Left Bloc deputy and member of 
the Economic Committee, why the Czech Republic had reduced its 
exports to the countries of the former USSR to the current 8 
percent [as heard], Dlouhy said that he firmly rejected the 
allegation that the Czech Republic will be withdrawing from 
Russian markets, thereby creating space for Western traders. 
According to Minister Dlouhy, one has to realize the extent to 
which the former states of the USSR are solvent and capable of 
paying for goods delivered. 
  Tomas Sojka, a member of the Economic Committee, was 
interested in knowing how the Czech Republic will behave as 
regards cooperation with the Visegrad Group of states. Dlouhy 
said that the Czech Government opposes the unnatural political 
institutionalization of mutual relations, but this is not valid 
for the sphere of economic cooperation, where the Czech 
Government supports the widest liberalization of reciprocal 
trade. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article in two installments by "vac": "1993--The Fourth </F>
Year of the Reform"] 
<H5>  [11 Mar p 7] </H5>
  [Text] The dominant feature of the economic development was 
stabilization; maintaining the balance and the trend to 
dynamically reinforce it on the macroeconomic level. The 
partition of the CSFR did not manifest itself in the Czech 
Republic by any obvious economic problems. The monetary policy 
caught the impact of the currency division in the first quarter 
and maintained the stability of the currency, including its rate 
of exchange. Favorable foreign currency reserves have been 
established. The volume of exports grew significantly. The 
economic standard measured by the volume of the GNP remained 
basically at the 1992 level. The economic structure changed 
only through the influence of private enterprise. Because of 
the needs of the open economy of the Czech state, the structure 
of large industry has not changed favorably. 
  The trend of the GNP development was responded to the 
aggregate demand that indicated a recovery of economic activity. 
In comparison with 1992, retail sales grew in 1993 by 1 percent 
in constant prices, services soared by 15 percent, investment 
demand rose 17 percent (in the first to third quarters of 1993, 
in comparison with the same period a year earlier, it will 
decline in the fourth quarter because of the huge increase in 
the fourth quarter of 1992), and exports grew by 20 percent (by 
approximately 11 percent, including Slovakia). Part of the 
increased demand was covered by a stock reduction. The 
aggregate supply from the main production sectors remained below 
the 1992 level: Industrial output declined by 5.3 percent, 
construction output by 7.5 percent, and agricultural output by 
0.8 percent. So far, the changes in the general structure of 
industrial production have not manifested themselves 
significantly, which is demonstrated in the large setbacks in 
several industrial sectors with a high degree of labor input. 
The exceptions, like the manufacture of cars and some other 
products, could not, overall, reverse the still-low 
competitiveness of engineering production and the consumer 
industry. 
  The manufacture of goods declined in comparison with 1992 in 
all sectors of industry (in organizations with 25 or more 
employees). The production of goods declined on a year-to-year 
basis more than 10 percent in mining nonenergy raw materials, 
the textile and garments industries, wooden goods manufacture, 
the production and processing of stone and ceramics, and 
particularly in the manufacture of machines and instruments. 
Among the other sectors of industry, the lowest production 
decline was registered in the manufacture of leather and leather 
goods, the manufacture of rubber goods, and plastic goods 
production--less that 2 percent each. 
  The decisive and still-growing share in industrial 
production 
belongs to food and condiments manufacture (16.5 percent); 
power, gas, and water production (10.8 percent); metal and metal 
goods production (14.3 percent); and vehicle manufacture (8.4 
percent). In addition to the aforementioned sectors with a low 
pace of production, the share of the manufacture of electrical 
and optical instruments also declined (4.1 percent) so that, 
together with the manufacture of machines and instruments (share 
of 7.7 percent) and vehicle production, the share of the former 
engineering and electrical engineering industries reaches 
approximately 20 percent. 
  The small enterprises (with staffs of fewer than 25) and 
natural persons, registered or not registered in the enterprise 
register, demonstrated much greater economic activity. 
According to a Czech Statistical Office estimate, the 
production of small enterprises and individuals increased by 20 
percent on a year-to-year basis, while the production in 
organizations with more than 25 employees declined by 7.4 
percent. The small business managed to increase the volume of 
output in construction by 1.5 percent, while production in large 
enterprises declined 10.1 percent. 
  The relationship between the growth of labor productivity 
and 
average wages did not develop favorably. While the GDP declined 
1 percent, the average nominal wages in the economy increased by 
25 percent and real wages by 3.5 percent; the productivity of 
labor in industry declined 1.3 percent, while nominal wages rose 
23.8 percent and real wages 2.5 percent; and, in construction, 
the 12.2 percent decline in productivity compares with a 28.6 
percent increase in nominal wages and 6.5 percent in real wages 
(all in comparison of 1993 with 1992). 
  The rate of inflation reached 20.8 percent in comparison 
with 
1992. It has been affected, from the very beginning of the 
year, by the transfer to the value-added tax, which was 
reflected in an 8-percent price increase. If we adjust the rate 
of inflation, taking away this effect, the inflation trend would 
reach less than 1 percent per month. While overall consumer 
prices rose 18.2 percent between December 1992 and December 
1993, the prices of food products rose 13.2 percent and nonfood 
products 18 percent, catering 21.9 percent, and services 25.3 
percent. Manufacturing prices in industry rose 11.4 percent; 
construction 26.9 percent; railroad, river, and air-cargo 
transport 29.5 percent; communications 28.9 percent; and farm 
products on average for the year 6.2 percent. 
  The political stability, continuing the favorable acceptance 
of the economic reform and the economic development by a 
majority of the population, and a relatively very low rate of 
unemployment were the main reasons for social accord. The 
overall unemployment rate of 3.5 percent indicates that the 
fundamental material restructuring has not yet begun. 
<H5>  [11 Mar p 3] </H5>
  [Text] Foreign demand was boosted by undervaluing the rate 
of exchange of the koruna [Kc], which is almost triple the 
purchase parity. Exports, excluding exports to Slovakia, rose 20 
percent in comparison with 1992; including Slovakia, it grew, 
according to the estimate, by more than 11 percent. Imports, 
because of the high volume of imports in 1992 before the 
currency division, increased 2.7 percent, excluding imports from 
Slovakia; including the estimate for Slovakia, it would be 
between 1 and 3 percent lower than in 1992. The 1993 trade 
balance ended with a surplus of Kc5.9 billion--without Slovakia, 
with a deficit of Kc3.7 billion. 
  The favorable development of the real trade relations, which 
reached the value of 104.1 percent, was achieved by a 2-percent 
increase of export prices and a reduction of the prices of 
imported goods by 1.7 percent. Projected into the volumes of 
exports and imports (without Slovakia), the price changes in 
1993 brought Kc12 billion to the Czech economy in comparison 
with the price levels of 1992. 
  The largest trading partner was Germany: Its share of 
imports 
was 25.1 percent and of exports 26.9 percent. 
  The surplus on the current account of the balance of 
payments 
in convertible currency reached $620 million (approximately Kc18 
billion). The convertible currency trade deficit was made up, 
and the source of the surplus was the surplus of services and 
transfers of private and enterprise foreign currency funds. In 
services, tourism (foreign currency income from foreigners 
reached $1.3 billion) and gas transit were the sectors most 
responsible for the surplus. 
  Foreign currency reserves in the entire banking system rose 
at the end of the year to $6.2 billion, of which the Czech 
National Bank's foreign currency reserves amounted to Kc3.8 
billion. The Czech National Bank's reserves cover a four-month 
volume of imports of goods and services in convertible currency. 
  A large part of the increase of foreign currency reserves 
reflects foreign currency funds drawn from abroad, which, 
however, also appear on the other side as an increase in gross 
indebtedness. In addition to the aforementioned surplus on the 
current account of the balance of payments, it was also the 
inflow of capital--above all, portfolio investments--that 
contributed to the increase in foreign currency reserves. Two 
issues of the Czech National Bank bonds, with a volume of $0.7 
billion, should be mentioned first. Foreign investments in 
securities on the domestic capital market also increased 
significantly. Foreign currency credits obtained by domestic 
firms directly from abroad were also among the sources of 
long-term capital. The inflow of direct investments from abroad 
declined in comparison with 1992 to reach $561 million (the 
direct investments from abroad for 1992 to 1993 amount to $2,053 
million). 
  The macroeconomic stability was actively affected in 1993 by 
the state budget. As opposed to the countries of the former 
Eastern bloc and most West European countries, the state budget 
had a surplus of Kc1.1 billion, and that with planned revenues 
surpassed by 4.6 percent and expenditures by 4.3 percent. The 
basis of budget revenues was taxes, specifically income tax 
(Kc71.9 billion), value-added tax and consumer tax (Kc107.5 
billion), and social security premiums (Kc106.0 billion). 
  While the monetary policy of the Czech National Bank was 
moderately restrictive and careful in early 1993, it relaxed in 
the second half of the year. The stability of the purchasing 
power of the koruna prevailed. The rate of exchange against the 
dollar did not substantially change in the course of the year 
and hovered about Kc29.15 per dollar. Money supply rose by 17.5 
percent in the course of the year--i.e., it moved more slowly 
than inflation. 
  The main reason for the growth of the money supply is the 
credits provided to the enterprise sector. The credits 
increased overall by Kc107 billion to reach Kc678 billion at the 
end of the year. The decline of the share of long-term credits 
and the concurrent increase in short-term credits were affected 
by the unclear nature of the development programs, the 
uncertainty of the management stability, and the worsening 
financial situation of the enterprises, together with fear on 
the part of the banks of the growing volume of risk credits, 
which are estimated at more than one-fifth of total credits. 
The credit policy was marked by high security for the credits 
and relatively high credits. The interest rate began to decline 
after the June reduction of the discount rate from 9.5 percent 
to 8 percent, but it still is higher than the interest rates 
charged on credit abroad. Therefore, in late 1993, the inflow 
of foreign capital in the form of credit became more 
significant. The volume of deposits increased in 1993 by Kc117 
billion to reach Kc636 billion. 
  The trend in the living standard sphere was characterized in 
1993 by a high growth of nominal wages--i.e., 28 percent in 
comparison with the previous year. Even with the 20.8-percent 
consumer price increase, the real income of the population rose 
by 6 percent. Real wages rose by 3.5 percent. In comparison 
with 1989, the real income of the population was still 15 
percent lower. 
  With the aforementioned average data, the living standard of 
individual groups and strata of the population began to 
significantly differentiate according to the per capita income 
in the applicable household groups. 
  The demographic development of the Czech Republic was 
marked, 
as in the previous several years, by a low natural increase of 
the population.

<F P=106> [Article by "tk": "Ministers Gave Green Light to the </F>
Program of Restructuring the Aviation Industry"] 
  [Text] Prague--Yesterday, the Council of Ministers 
confirmed the plan of restructuring the aviation industry. 
According to the approved proposal, Aero Prague Co. is to 
eliminate all of its bank loans and thereby also the risk of 
bankruptcy. In the final stage, only four subsidiaries will 
remain in the Aero Holding--Aero Vodochody, Letov Praha, 
Technometra Radotin, and the Research and Testing Aviation 
Institute. The National Property Fund will keep 64.8 percent of 
the holding shares. Aero will hold 53 percent stake in the 
subsidiaries. The debt clearing will result from the 
capitalization of the main creditors' claims. The Investicni a 
Postovni Banka and CSOB [Czechoslovak Foreign Trade Bank] will 
each purchase 10-percent shares of the holding subsidiaries at 
70 percent of the nominal value, and the Konsolidacni banka 27 
percent. 
  The tender for the purchase of majority stakes in Moravan 
Otrokovice and Motorlet Jinonice is to be evaluated in the near 
future. The Czech Frut Ovo Co. has offered $45 million for 
Motorlet, and the Canadian firm Pratt &amp; Whitney has offered 
$1 
million cash, $10 million in the form of know-how and $14 
million in investments. The same Frut Ovo has offered $800 
million for Moravan, while Bata offered only know-how. If the 
tender for Motorlet is not successful, a competition will be 
announced. If the talks with the bidders for Moravan are not 
successful. either, the Investicni a Postovni Banka will 
purchase the company, and the proceeds will be used to pay the 
Aero debts. A competition is also being considered for Let 
Kunovice if a suitable foreign partner is not found. 
  Yesterday, the ministers also discussed the conditions for 
the purchase of Czechoslovak Airlines shares from Air France Co. 
by the Konsolidacni Banka. Minister Karel Dyba observed that 
the purchase of the French company's stake will also be 
discussed by the government later today, but he refused to 
publish any additional information.

  [Text] [Announcer] A visit to Poland by Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin in May; a protocol on this year's 
cooperation in two weeks' time; the completion of work on a 
long-term agreement on economic cooperation in May--these are 
the results of Polish-Russian talks that ended in Moscow. 
Correspondent Viktor Siezieniewski reports: 
  [Siezieniewski] Waldemar Pawlak and Viktor Chernomyrdin's 
talks lasted longer than scheduled. As both underscored later, 
it had been a very concrete dialogue of partners interested in 
breaking the impasse in economic relations. The heads of 
government did not conceal their satisfaction at the course of 
the negotiations. I asked Waldemar Pawlak for details. 
  [Begin recording] [Pawlak] We focussed on actions that could 
bring quick and measurable advantages. Among the long-term 
actions, it is worth mentioning the prospects for signing a 
long-term agreement on economic cooperation. It might yield a 
protocol of agreements for 1994 even this year [as heard], 
including financial solutions for servicing our cooperation. 
  In the more distant future, there are solutions that, 
through 
the activities of our governments, can contribute to the 
expansion of cooperation between specific enterprises and 
people, from cooperation in banking and finance, through the 
building of the infrastructure of transport, railways, highways, 
and communications, to cooperation concerning strategic raw 
materials, including the construction of a pipeline for 
transporting Russian gas to Western Europe. These are the big 
ventures on which the activities of the governments are to focus 
in order to create conditions for meetings and contacts at all 
levels. This would be the practical implementation of our idea, 
put forward at the beginning of this year, for the partnership 
for development and multidirectional foreign policy. 
  [Siezieniewski] Did you find a partner in Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin? 
  [Pawlak] Yes. We have already decided on a concrete working 
schedule for particular ministries aimed at reaching practical 
decisions that will contribute to the expansion of cooperation. 
We both agreed that the time wasted could not be made up in the 
future. 
  [Siezieniewski] When will the next meeting be held? 
  [Pawlak] Prime Minister Chernomyrdin will visit Poland in 
May. Then we will take further steps to make our cooperation at 
all levels easier. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Warsaw, 15 Mar--The Civic Committee for the 
Defense of Poles in the Vilnius Area [OKOPW] believes that the 
already approved text of the Polish-Lithuanian Treaty strikes 
against Polish reasons of state and does not protect the 
interests of Poles in Lithuania. According to Grzegorz 
Dziemidowicz, press spokesman of the MSZ [Foreign Affairs 
Ministry], for the time being, the text of the treaty is secret, 
and, until it is initialled by the foreign affairs ministers of 
both states, the MSZ will not say anything about the issue. 
  OKOPW Chairman Ryszard Szawlowski said at a news conference 
in Warsaw today that there were reservations about both the 
preamble to the treaty and the lack of provisions protecting the 
interests of Poles resident in Lithuania. Although, in 
accordance with earlier announcements, no persons or dates are 
mentioned in the preamble, according to him, its provisions 
clearly refer to specific historical events. 
  The statement about the tragic past and losses of both 
peoples caused by the Nazi totalitarianism means that the MSZ is 
giving the Lithuanians "false moral testimony." 
  According to the committee, through their policies toward 
the 
local Poles, the Lithuanian authorities violate international 
standards and decisions contained in the Polish-Lithuanian 
Declaration, while the present text of the treaty "gives the 
Lithuanian authorities an instrument to morally finish off the 
Poles in Lithuania." The Polish authorities have not bothered to 
ensure that the treaty contains provisions protecting the 
interests of the 300,000 Poles in Lithuania, including the 
return of land to Polish farmers or property to public 
organizations, nor is there an entry concerning a Polish 
university in Vilnius. 
  The treaty is to be initialled next Friday [18 March], 
during 
Lithuanian Foreign Affairs Minister Povilas Gylys's visit to 
Warsaw. The committee representatives said they found out the 
text of the treaty from "reliable sources" in the Vilnius area. 
They told journalists that they had talked about the treaty 
with Deputy Prime Minister Aleksander Luczak but that he did not 
say anything about its possible renegotiation. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Marek Chorabik: "I Will Choose My Vice Minister </F>
Myself, Minister Kolodziejczyk Says on His Return From Paris"] 
  [Text] "I am open to the coalition's proposals concerning 
the choice of [defense] vice minister. However, I will not 
accept a political commissar. I need a man who will be well 
briefed for the job in substantive terms," Defense Minister 
Piotr Kolodziejczyk said yesterday in Gdynia in reply to 
questions about the appointment of a candidate to the post of 
vice minister at the National Defense Ministry [MON]. 
  Kolodziejczyk did not confirm the report that Zbigniew 
Siemiatkowski, currently press spokesman for the Democratic Left 
Alliance, has been put forward as a possible candidate. 
  The MON chief stated that the matter will be the subject of 
his meeting with representatives of the government coalition, 
scheduled to take place during the coming week. Kolodziejczyk 
expected that the coalition would put forward several 
candidates, from among whom he would select the person most 
suitable for the post. 
  The immediate reason for calling the meeting between Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk and reporters was the conclusion of the trilateral 
talks between defense ministers of France, Germany, and Poland, 
which took place in Paris on Thursday night and Friday morning. 
"We achieved more than we had expected to achieve," Minister 
Kolodziejczyk said, clearly pleased with the outcome of the 
Paris meeting. "We gained powerful sponsors, who will promote 
our position in our efforts to join the Western European Union." 
Kolodziejczyk expressed his conviction that Poland will be an 
associate member of the Union as early as in May. 
  Kolodziejczyk also believed that the change in both 
Germany's 
and France's attitude to Poland and its position in Central 
Europe was a positive aspect of his meeting with Ministers 
Volker Ruehe and Francois Leotard. According to the head of the 
Polish defense sector, Poland at long last has a real chance to 
"emerge from the gray zone and find itself in a zone whose 
colors are identical with the rest of Europe." 
  One of the more immediately tangible results Minister 
Kolodziejczyk brought with him from Paris is the agreement on 
calling joint staff exercises and joint maneuvers of basic 
military units. To begin with, these will involve exercises for 
highland and Alpine riflemen on Polish territory (in the 
Carpathian Mountains) and in France.

<F P=106> [PAP report by "Ziel": "Fiasco Averted: Mazowiecki Says He </F>
Changed His Mind"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Mazowiecki expressed the hope 
that the new party [created by merging the Democratic Union (UD) 
and the Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD)] would be "marked by 
organizational efficiency" and "free from the crisis and 
paralysis that has been crippling the UD for months.". The new 
group is conceived as an alternative to the political 
configuration currently in force. 
<H5>  Kuron's Dilemmas </H5>
  Jacek Kuron revealed that he would join the new party, 
designed to emerge from the UD and KLD fusion, only if it 
declared itself firmly in favor of economic effectiveness. 
However, that goal should be realized on the basis of general 
public support. Kuron insisted that the conflict between public 
expectations and the requirements of rational economics was the 
main reason for the collapse of political authorities. 
<H5>  There Are Some With Whom We Cannot Share the Same Path </H5>
  The principles of the new party's statute do not provide for 
the existence of separate factions within the group. The 
Congress received this clause with many reservations. Ecological 
Faction chairman Radoslaw Gawlik even went so far as to call it 
"antidemocratic, politically stupid, and potentially explosive 
for the Union." 
  Social-Liberal Faction chairman Zofia Kuratowska was more 
circumspect in her opinions. Yet even she warned against the 
danger that the party might now lose many members who had 
originally joined the UD because they identified themselves with 
a particular UD faction. Kuratowska was even more concerned 
about possible membership losses that may be incurred by the 
fusion with the KLD. "In some regions," she stressed, "there are 
particular KLD members with whom we would not sit at the same 
table." Factional divisions and their associated difficulties 
manifested themselves early enough, making it impossible for 
Congress delegates assembled in the hall to sing "Happy 
Birthday" to Bronislaw Geremek: Each table sang in a different 
key and to a different tempo.

<F P=106> [Article by Leslaw Maleszka: "Third UD Congress: Stitching </F>
Together What Has Unraveled"] 
  [Text] By an overwhelming majority of votes, the Third 
Democratic Union [UD] Congress adopted a declaration on joining 
forces with the Liberal Democratic Congress. The unification 
congress of the two parties will take place toward the end of 
April. 
  There were 318 delegates voting in favor of the union, four 
who voted against, and 27 who abstained from casting their 
votes. Suggestions of a name to be given to the eventual new 
party included such propositions as "Liberal Democratic Union," 
"Democratic Congress," and "New Democracy." 
  Fortunately, attempts to avert a major conflict that 
threatened to "blow up" the Congress ended in a successful 
resolution of the underlying problem just a dozen or so hours 
before the official opening of the deliberations. During a 
session of the UD presidium that lasted from late Friday night 
through the early hours of Saturday, Tadeusz Mazowiecki agreed 
to stay on as UD chairman and to run as candidate in the 
forthcoming election of the leader of the new united party. 
Everyone joined in persuading Mazowiecki to stay: Bronislaw 
Geremek, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, Jan Rokita, and other parliament 
members collected signatures on an open petition concerning this 
matter, while local UD circles kept sending in telex messages in 
support of Mazowiecki's continuing chairmanship. Finally, 
Mazowiecki decided to stay out--and was applauded by the 
assembled delegates in a standing ovation. He replied with a 
concluding address in which he firmly demanded strict loyalty 
from all of the leaders of the individual UD factions. "Maybe I 
really am too slow, and maybe I do indeed need to be prompted 
into acting, but this can be done internally within the party 
rather than through outside manipulation. I would prefer other 
ways of finding out about a whole variety of controversial 
utterances made by my colleagues than coming across them as I 
listen to broadcasts of radio programs. 
  It is true that Mazowiecki plays the role of "middleman," or 
mediator in UD: He reconciles sides and settles conflicts when 
it comes to program-oriented and tactical differences between 
the party's right wing (represented by Rokita) and the left wing 
(headed by Frasyniuk). In internal "Unionese" language, 
Mazowiecki is sometimes dubbed "Paper Clip" or "Safety Pin," to 
denote his ability to pin back together what has become 
unraveled. 
<H5>  UD Congress Program Debate </H5>
  There are really no substantive differences over party 
program between supporters of the number of separate factions 
within UD. Faction leaders were unanimous on this point, 
regardless of the fact that they had earlier--sometimes as 
recently as a few days before the Congress--insisted that a 
split in the party was inevitable. 
  Marek Dabrowski emphasized the need to present an integrated 
vision of a social and economic program. Jacek Kuron asserted 
that UD faced an obvious dilemma between the concept of a 
rational economic policy and the need to demonstrate sensitivity 
to social needs and expectations. The way out of this dilemma 
can only be through social movements galvanizing citizens to 
engage in a reform program, and certainly not a war waged 
against the state budget by the trade unions. 
  The final Congress declaration was formulated along similar 
lines: Social discontent was caused by the left-wing 
coalition's failure to realize the promises it had made during 
the election campaign as well as from the lack of a clear-cut 
concept of the necessary reforms. Nevertheless, social conflicts 
should be resolved at a debating table rather than through 
organized strikes. 
  UD radicals engaging in strong campaigns against the 
Catholic 
Church took a rapping across the knuckles. Jerzy Turowicz 
argued that anticlericalism engendered unnecessary conflicts in 
a situation where even the church itself, through the words of 
such authorities as John Paul II or Bishop Tadeusz Pieronek, 
secretary to the Polish Episcopate, supports the idea that a 
state should officially adopt a neutral worldview. A most 
forceful line of argument tackling the same subject was put 
forward by Aleksander Smolar: "Various politicians, mostly more 
popular than eminent, have misrepresented UD's real position 
through their utterances on church-state relations. There are 
limits to such misrepresentation, and those who overstep them 
should look for suitable niches for themselves outside UD." 
  Smolar's words were interpreted by the audience as an 
allusion to some recent statements by Barbara Labuda referring 
to "creeping clericalization of the state." The culprit herself 
failed to reply to the challenge. She was absent from the 
debating hall throughout the second day of the Congress.

<F P=106> [Article by Barbara Szczepula: "Tusk Wants Balcerowicz: </F>
Situation Before UD-KLD Fusion"] 
  [Text] The Liberals are worried by recent reports that 
Tadeusz Mazowiecki intends to resign from running as candidate 
chairman of the proposed new party alliance between the Liberal 
Democratic Congress [KLD] and the Democratic Union [UD]. 
According to [KLD chairman] Donald Tusk, Mazowiecki would 
guarantee a successful fusion--that is, a union between the two 
parties in their entirety--better than any other candidate. 
Tusk has expressed his hope that UD would consult its 
recommendations for new candidate leaders with the KLD. 
Moreover, he let it be understood that the KLD would not 
support Wladyslaw Frasyniuk as candidate to the post. 
  Instead, he himself suggested a preferred KLD candidate. He 
is Leszek Balcerowicz. The only trouble is that Balcerowicz, 
who, incidentally, does not belong to any party, has so far 
failed to indicate in any way whether he would be willing to 
accept such an offer. 
  During a press conference convened in Warsaw before the 
opening of the Democratic Union's Third Congress, due to begin 
today, Donald Tusk presented those assembled with the 
fundamentals of his party program, which the Liberals are not 
prepared to renounce in the process of merging with UD. These 
are formulated in a nine-point document entitled "The KLD's 
Liberal Minimum." The document discusses the following points: 
a new constitution, which should be approved by the whole 
nation; a gradual regionalization of the country; and the 
preservation of the state's neutral worldview, which should 
nonetheless guarantee optimum relations between state and church 
institutions. The last clause could, in my opinion, generate 
reservations among UD's right-wing orientation because Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki--and, incidentally, other UD activists, too--would 
replace the condition of "neutral worldview" with one that 
speaks of a "friendly separation between state and church." 
  But let us return to the fundamentals of the KLD program. 
The Liberals go on to discuss the trade unions, which "should 
not determine the shape of the budget or other important 
decisions." They discuss the need to protect taxpayers from the 
state's fiscal policies--in both their open and hidden form. 
They insist on protection of the free economy: "It is 
necessary to safeguard economic freedom against all forms of 
monopoly, unfair competition, and attempts to control it by the 
power apparatus." They discuss privatization and 
reprivatization. They talk about reforms in the budget-funded 
sector. Finally, they mention the need to bring the country 
"into the sphere of the self-integrating international 
community." 
  So much for the Liberals. 
  Now for the Democratic Union: The Congress convening on 
Saturday and Sunday should pass decisions on several questions 
and also elect a chairman. If Tadeusz Mazowiecki refuses to be 
persuaded to put up his candidacy, there could well be trouble. 
Individual Union factions have campaigned to promote their own 
candidates: Hanna Suchocka, Jan M. Rokita, and Wladyslaw 
Frasyniuk. Consequently, observers watching the political scene 
do not preclude the possiblity of an eventual split within the 
Democratic Union.

<F P=106> [Interview with Donald Tusk, leader of the </F>
Liberal-Democratic Congress, by Ewa Milewicz; place and date not 
given: "Premarital Confessions"] 
  [Excerpts] [Milewicz] Why did the Democratic Union [UD] win 
seats in the Sejm and the Liberal-Democratic Congress [KLD] did 
not? 
  [Tusk] Probably because UD received more votes. To vote for 
the KLD, one has to have firm ideological and economic views. 
UD's electorate consists of all kinds of people. 
  [Milewicz] UD got into the Sejm because its image is not so 
distinct as that of the KLD? 
  [Tusk] Every party in Poland has its own image. We appear as 
schemers and thieves, Center Accord appears as a collection of 
iconoclasts and dullards, and the Christian-National Union 
appears as a party of clericalists. 
  [Milewicz] And UD? Perhaps it appears as a collection of 
mummies? 
  [Tusk] Indeed. 
  [Milewicz] Perhaps people prefer dull political parties to 
vociferous ones? 
  [Tusk] Such a view would be an insult to UD. The KLD is more 
avant-garde, less embedded in Polish life. 
  [Milewicz] Less embedded in the life of this Poland. 
  [Tusk] Yes. The KLD is alien to the life of Poland in 1993 
and 1994. Despite everything, UD is more at home. 
  [Milewicz] So the KLD is merging with UD in order to avoid 
oblivion? 
  [Tusk] That is certainly one of the reasons. I fear being 
pushed out into the fringe. I would like to see a revitalization 
of the KLD's principles. 
  [Milewicz] What? You mean you want to experience a 
parliamentary "afterlife"? 
  [Tusk] The KLD needs to be revitalized because liberal 
values 
are not enshrined in our lives. Thanks to the merger, liberal 
views will have a greater chance of survival. After all, there 
is no shortage of liberals in UD. 
  The second reason for the merger is to make life easier for 
our electorate. People do not want to be forever faced with the 
decision of who to vote for, the KLD or UD. 
  [Milewicz] But there are people who would prefer to have a 
"pure KLD" and a "pure UD". 
  [Tusk] But there are more and more people who want a clear 
political situation--in other words, not more than three or four 
parties competing in the elections. [passage omitted] 
  [Milewicz] If it were the KLD that had won seats in the Sejm 
instead of UD, would you still be in favor of a merger? 
  [Tusk] I have never thought about that. 
  [Milewicz] Would you not have told UD: Serves you right? 
  [Tusk] I probably would have done so. But that is natural. 
There have been a lot of bitter moments in our mutual relations. 
A television election broadcast on behalf of UD told the viewers 
not to vote for small parties like us. 
  It was not the KLD's idea to merge. The signal came from UD. 
I wish to dispel the myth that it is only the liberals that 
stand to gain something from the merger, and that UD will only 
lose. We should all gain something. I am sure that will be the 
case.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcin Dominik Zdort: "Right Wing Wants To </F>
Publish Its Own Paper; In A Few Days, NOWE PANSTWO"] 
  [Text] Rightist coalitions that have been established in 
recent months want to publish papers that would represent their 
policy. In several days, the first issue of NOWE PANSTWO [NEW 
STATE] will come out; it will be a paper related to the alliance 
of Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Wieslaw Chrzanowski. 
  NOWE PANSTWO appeared last year (also during the election 
campaign); there were 10 issues, with a circulation of 3,000 
copies, which were internal leaflets of the Center Alliance [PC] 
published by the office of PC Vice President Adam Lipinski. 
Lipinski is also the organizer and editor in chief of the new 
publication. 
  The first issue, which will appear in several days, will 
consist of 16 pages; its format will resemble that of GAZETA 
WYBORCZA, and it will cost 6,000 zlotys. "We imposed a very 
strict financial discipline; we prepared this issue along with 
several people from beginning to end," says Adam Lipinski. The 
publisher of the paper was supposed to be the "New State" 
Foundation; however, the court of law refused to register it, 
and it has been for the time being registered as a noncommercial 
partnership. 
  NOWE PANSTWO has, for the time being at least, decided not 
to 
use the distribution services of "Ruch." Representatives of the 
editing team claim that it is too expensive. Lipinski's paper 
will be distributed by private companies, rightist parties, and 
Solidarity. 
  The subtitle of NOWE PANSTWO reads: "To the right of the 
center." This paper is not directly linked to the bloc of the 
Christian-National Union, teh PC, Movement for the Republic, 
Peasant Accord, and the Conservative Coalition [KK]. The first 
issue has been prepared, among others, by the leaders of the 
Union for Real Politics [UPR] such as Stanislaw Michalkiewicz, 
Rafal Ziemkiewicz, and Tomasz Gabis; Ludwik Dorn of the PC; 
Marek Budzisz of the KK, as well as people related to such 
papers as ARKA, DEBATA, and SPOTKANIA. The main subject of the 
first--strictly political--issue is a debate on what is the real 
right wing; however, the paper also wants to inform readers 
about cultural issues and comment on current events. "It is 
easiest to obtain political material," admits Adam Lipinski. In 
the beginning, NOWE PANSTWO will appear irregularly, and after a 
few months it is supposed to become a weekly. The organizers 
are for the time being not even dreaming of turning the paper 
into a daily, even though they do not rule out such a 
possibility in a more remote future. 
  Also, the Agreement of 11 November, which consists of the 
UPR, the Christian-Democratic Party [PChD], the Conservative 
Party, and the Peasant-Christian Party, would like to start a 
publication "close" to this alliance. Primarily, politicians of 
smaller parties are making efforts to achieve that because the 
UPR already has at its disposal NAJWYZSZY CZAS, which is quite 
an influential paper, coming out twice a week (also as NAJWYZSZY 
CZAS-BIS). PChD leader Pawel Laczkowski recently announced that 
such a paper will be established; so far, however, this has 
remained up in the air--it is still not known where the money 
for financing such an initiative should be taken from.

<F P=106> [Interview with Brigadier-General Stanislaw Wozniak, chief </F>
of the Department of Foreign Military Affairs at the Ministry of 
National Defense, by Stanislaw Lukaszewski; place and date not 
given: "The Army in International Politics"] 
  [Text] [Lukaszewski] You accompanied Defense Minister 
Kolodziejczyk on his visit to France. One of the results of this 
visit is that our Army is going to take part in joint maneuvers 
with the French and German Armies. What tasks has the visit 
imposed on your department? 
  [Wozniak] At their Paris meeting, the defense ministers of 
Poland, France, and Germany opened a historic stage in the 
history of mutual relations between these countries. The growth 
of military bilateral contacts noted by the ministers provided a 
basis to develop trilateral cooperation, including meetings of 
experts and the holding of joint exercises. In this connection, 
my department now has the task of preparing reports and analyses 
that take into account the legislative peculiarities of each 
country that is taking part in international exercises. The 
ministers approved in principle the idea of a joint exercise 
that would be held in France in the fall, with the participation 
of French, German, and Polish troops. Polish observers would 
also be present. 
  [Lukaszewski] In accordance with Polish security policy, 
defense strategy, and foreign policy, this year's military 
foreign policy is aimed at making Poland a member of European 
security structures--i.e., the WEU [Western European Union], the 
EU [European Union], and NATO. As the man responsible for 
military foreign policy, what are the guiding principles of this 
policy? 
  [Wozniak] The guiding principle is that European security is 
indivisible, and Poland's efforts in this sphere are aimed at 
creating an all-European security system that matches the 
political-military challenges and expectations, as well as the 
economic capabilities. We are trying to establish good political 
and military relationships not only with our neighbors, but also 
with other countries. We are concentrating on problems of 
multilateral regional and all-European cooperation. We are 
availing ourselves of existing international structures and 
organizations in order to attain our objective. 
  [Lukaszewski] What do you think of the CSCE as the platform 
of a new European security system? 
  [Wozniak] The CSCE is a major component of the process of 
creating new European security structures. Our representatives 
are taking part in CSCE talks on arms control and on confidence 
and security-building measures. We are concerned that progress 
be achieved in this sphere. 
  Within the CSCE, Poland has already been participating with 
other countries in achieving stability in the region. Poland is 
also taking part in extinguishing conflicts and supervising the 
implementation of conventional arms-control agreements such as 
the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty and the 1992 Vienna 
document. We hope that the CSCE will lead to a cooperative 
system of security in Europe. 
  However, the primary goal of Polish politics is full 
membership in NATO. But, because this is going to take a long 
time, Poland in the meantime is taking part in the work of the 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council, which is also a major 
component of the new European security. 
  [Lukaszewski] What are the other paths of military 
cooperation for 1994? 
  [Wozniak] In our plans of cooperation with foreign defense 
ministries and European military structures this year, we have 
put greater emphasis on defense problems and the strengthening 
of democratic control over the armed forces. We have also 
suggested an exchange of experiences in planning and conducting 
military exercises with the help of computer simulations. We 
will also examine ways of guaranteeing good interpersonal 
relationships and human rights inside the Army. 
  [Lukaszewski] What about relations with our neighbors? 
  [Wozniak] Agreements have been reached that will cause a 
revival and an increase of good-neighborly relations. There will 
be an increased flow of information, broader personal contacts, 
and measures to increase the mutual trust between border zones. 
For this purpose, there is going to be cooperation in military 
training between neighboring military districts, as well as 
between military units and training establishments on both sides 
of the border. 
  [Lukaszewski] Have any details been established in this 
sphere? 
  [Wozniak] Yes. We are going to send more of our soldiers to 
be trained in foreign military academies. There are going to be 
more exchange visits by officers on active duty and by military 
lecturers. We are going to send soldiers on language training 
and further training to the United States, Germany, France, 
Great Britain, and Canada. We will try to send soldiers on 
training sessions to Norway and Spain. In the Baltic Sea, we are 
tightening contacts with the naval and coastal defense forces of 
Germany and Denmark. We will continue to seek agreements with 
the defense ministries of non-NATO countries on the basic paths 
of military cooperation. Further ministerial agreements will be 
concluded soon. 
  [Lukaszewski] Can you give any details? 
  [Wozniak] So far, we have concluded military cooperation 
agreements with the defense ministries of 126 countries, 
including all of our neighbors--i.e., Germany, Russia, Belarus, 
Lithuania, Ukraine, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic, as well as 
Belgium, France, Latvia, Greece, the Netherlands, Hungary, and 
Romania. 
  The extent and content of the cooperation varies from one 
country to another. But, in every single case, there is a desire 
to be open and to implement European agreements in security, 
disarmament, and confidence-building measures. 
  [Lukaszewski] What do you think of the Partnership for 
Peace? 
  [Wozniak] Poland has eagerly accepted the U.S. Partnership 
for Peace initiative, viewing it as the first meaningful step in 
the process of including the countries of Central and Eastern 
Europe in the West European system of security. For us, 
Partnership for Peace confirms NATO's commitment to the security 
of all Europe. 
  [Lukaszewski] What is the situation with our eastern policy? 
  [Wozniak] Poland wants to open a new chapter in its eastern 
policy. This need stems from the changes that are occurring on 
the territory of the former USSR and from our relations with the 
Russian Federation. In recent years, major progress has been 
achieved in establishing equal relations with the new countries 
on this territory. We consider our activity here as a major 
contribution to the construction of all-European security. 
  [Lukaszewski] And what is your opinion of the 
nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction? 
  [Wozniak] We attach particular importance to the 
nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Poland was the 
coauthor of the UN General Assembly resolution calling on all 
member countries to sign the convention to ban chemical weapons 
as soon as possible, which took place in Paris in January 1993. 
The convention is a unique international agreement in the sphere 
of disarmament. It imposes a complete and general ban on the use 
of chemical weapons and introduces broad verification measures 
at the same time. We hope this ban will be observed and extended 
indefinitely. 
  [Lukaszewski] Right now, peace missions are an important 
factor in stabilizing the military and political situation on a 
global and regional scale. But let us discuss Polish involvement 
in UN peace missions separately because that is also an 
important and interesting topic. 
  [Wozniak] The involvement of Polish soldiers in 
international 
missions goes back almost 40 years. That provides another reason 
for you to conduct an interview at the Department of Military 
Foreign Affairs at the Defense Ministry. I suggest you talk to 
one of my deputies about the participation of the Polish Armed 
Forces in international activity in extinguishing conflicts and 
restoring peace.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 15 (TANJUG) -- The Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia Prime Minister, Radoje Kontic, has called for the 
extension of the mandate of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
in the U.N. protected areas (UNPAs) (Krajina), which expires on 
March 31, 1994, and set out that the "UNPROFOR presence in the 
UNPAs is necessary until a political settlement is reached." 
  The Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) was proclaimed a U.N. 
protected area under the plan of special U.N. envoy for the 
former Yugoslavia Cyrus Vance in March 1992, after the 
Krajina-Croatia conflict broke out in 1991 because of Croatia's 
forcible secession from the former Yugoslavia. 
  The RSK, which comprises predominantly Serb-populated areas 
within the administrative borders of the former Yugoslav 
republic of Croatia, was proclaimed in response to Croatia's 
forcible secession and the attempt of its authorities to reduce 
the Serb people to a national minority. 
  Kontic said in a letter sent to U.N. Secretary-General 
Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali that U.N. resolution 871 of October 4, 1993, under 
which the UNPROFOR's mandate was extended until March 31, 1994, 
envisaged that the U.N. peace-keepers "remain in the UNPAs until 
a comprehensive political settlement of the Yugoslav crisis is 
found." 
  In the letter, a copy of which was sent to TANJUG on 
Tuesday, 
Kontic said that resolution 871 also envisaged that the 
"UNPROFOR mandate is to be renewed if such a solution is not 
achieved through negotiations." 
  "It is not necessary to make special mention of the 
importance of the UNPROFOR presence in the past, since it was 
precisely UNPROFOR that has ensured the consistent 
implementation of the Vance plan, enabled the maintenance of 
fragile peace and prevented further confrontation of the parties 
in conflict," Kontic said in the letter. 
  The Yugoslav prime minister set out that the "F.R. of 
Yugoslavia considers that conditions have not yet been created 
for terminating the UNPROFOR peace mission and that the UNPROFOR 
presence in the UNPAs is necessary until a political settlement 
is reached." 
  The letter said that if new U.N. troops were to be engaged 
or 
regularly replaced, it would, "for historical reasons, be 
inappropriate to engage troops" from neighbouring countries or 
former occupying forces. 
  The Yugoslav prime minister said that the "F.R.Y. supports 
the Vance plan and is interested" that it be fully respected and 
implemented by all parties. Kontic said that Yugoslavia would 
"strive to facilitate the UNPROFOR peace mission in the former 
Yugoslavia and contribute, within the limits of its 
possibilities, to reducing the costs of the peace mission."

<F P=106> [Speech by Mirko Marjanovic, Serbian prime </F>
minister-designate, to the Serbian Assembly in Belgrade -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed deputies, Mr. Milosevic, president of the 
Republic of Serbia, has entrusted me with the mandate to create 
the government of the Republic of Serbia. After holding 
comprehensive consultations, I am going to propose the 
government members to you today. At the same time, before the 
government is elected I want to put forward its program. 
  The political (?pressures) from abroad and grave economic 
and 
social problems that we have been confronted with in the country 
require clear answers and resolute steps from us. The basic 
thing is to create an economic and political atmosphere in which 
the creativity, hard work, and entrepreneurship of our citizens 
will have more free scope, despite the economic sanctions, and 
the significant potential of our economy can be activated. 
Instead of adapting passively to difficult business conditions 
and to survival, the government of the Republic of Serbia that 
this prominent house should elect today will do everything with 
a view to marking 1994 with permanent positive changes and above 
all to having the policy of peace, which we shall persistently 
advocate, contribute to a just solution for the Serbian people 
in the Srpska republic and the republic of Serbian Krajina. By 
defending peace, we shall also be maintaining our economic 
recovery in the best way. We should show determination in 
implementing the program for reconstruction of the monetary 
system and the strategy of economic recovery of the country in 
order, now that inflation has been checked, to be able to 
quickly increase production, improve the standard of living, and 
provide prospects for the young generation. The operation of 
the rule of law should be clearly felt and affirmed, and the 
principles of democratic rule should be affirmed. 
  The past year has shown more than clearly that the economy 
and society simply cannot function under hyperinflation. 
Hyperinflation has had a destructive and devastating effect on 
all spheres of life. It has blocked production, contributed to 
many an injustice in distribution, and brought the standard of 
living of the majority of population below the level of bare 
subsistence. The program for reconstruction of the monetary 
system and the strategy of economic recovery that we have 
started to implement has proved to be the only response to the 
great difficulties the Yugoslav economy has been experiencing 
under the sanctions, the war around us, and the large number of 
refugees from war-affected regions. 
  The program is a highly professional one, and the new 
government unanimously accepts it as the basis of its policy, 
determined to consistently implement it together with the 
Federal Government. Not only the federal and republican 
governments, but also a great majority of experts and 
businessmen have assessed that there is no alternative to this 
program. In particular, it has been wholeheartedly accepted by 
the citizens, who justifiably feel threatened by the economic 
chaos. The return to a healthy dinar, a balanced budget, and 
financial discipline, these being essential elements of monetary 
reform and the most important means of curbing inflation, are 
only the initial, albeit inevitable, steps in the attempt to 
stabilize the economy and bring an increase in production, 
employment, and the standard of living. An examination has 
shown that our foreign exchange and other reserves are greater 
than had been assumed and in any case sufficient if the whole 
program is consistently implemented. 
  The program must be regarded not only as a package of 
measures to curb hyperinflation and bring a short-term 
improvement of the economic situation, but also as a fundamental 
turnabout in the way we conduct economic operations. There has 
long been such an intention in the projections of our economic 
system, but it has never been consistently applied. What was 
lacking was a healthy currency as the objective criterion for 
business or any other kind of decisionmaking in economic life. 
And that we now have. 
  The reform of the monetary system puts strong pressure on 
the 
economy in the direction of rational behavior, which is not only 
in one's own interest, but also in the general social interest. 
With increased independence, the responsibility of an 
enterprise for its survival and prosperity, as well as for the 
existence of the workers it employs increases. By doing away 
with primary emission, wages must be earned and in order to earn 
them, one must produce and in fact produce the goods the market 
wants. 
  One of the basic aims of economic policy will be to support 
the restructuring of big enterprises -- where economically 
justifiable -- and to stimulate the more rapid development of 
small and medium-sized enterprises. Of course, the state cannot 
take upon itself the the enterprises' job of increasing 
production and improving efficiency. However, it can give its 
support to stimulating entrepreneurship and market-oriented 
production and will do so, proceeding from the fact that a 
healthy dinar is above all the main motive and at the same time 
an economic imperative for achieving better results. 
  We shall try to expand the domestic market for the 
reconstructed and the new production. The government shall be 
particularly active in encouraging the export orientation of our 
economy, although we are aware of all the limits that have been 
imposed by the sanctions. However, export possibilities exist 
even now. We particularly need to prepare for the period after 
the sanctions are lifted. The Serbian economy has always had 
its place in the world, it had, and still has, something to 
offer to the world market. We shall also create favorable 
conditions for foreign capital investments. Serbia cannot 
achieve its economic independence within a closed economy, but 
only through a decisive and wise opening up toward the world 
based on our developmental advantages, primarily our expert and 
qualified people -- particularly the young ones -- significant 
industrial capacities, agriculture, natural resources, and the 
favorable economic position of our country. With the successful 
monetary reconstruction of our monetary system, we have, in this 
phase, stabilized the economy and helped the existentially most 
threatened level of society. This must now be accompanied by an 
increase in production and real wages, and must coincide with 
the initiation of new investments. Our policy is aimed at 
increasing the national revenue and measures to make its 
distribution economically stimulating and, in social terms, as 
fair as possible. I appeal to you to help us realize these 
tasks, in spite of the party differences, which we will respect. 
  The difficult task of rebalancing the republic's budget lies 
before us. The increase of any source of budget revenue causes 
resistance and skepticism among the public, while, on the other 
hand, the termination and reduction of any achieved right to 
budgetary funds elicits anger and protest. Because of this, we 
are faced with the question of how to balance the budget without 
again reaching for primary emission and avoiding the chaos of 
last year's hyperinflation. The government shall -- decisively 
and persistently -- decrease budgetary expenditure. However, we 
also intend to undertake the necessary reforms of the taxation 
system, which would have a stimulating effect on our economy and 
lead to larger tax revenue without increasing tax rates. We 
shall also strive to encompass the gray economy with the tax 
[word indistinct]. We shall strive to promote state bonds on 
the capital market as soon as possible, which would contribute 
to the reduction of our budget deficit without a supplemental 
emission of money and a new tax burden. On the other hand, the 
legal and other obligations that our republic services from the 
budget are great, particularly obligations toward the level of 
social and medical protection, security of our citizens and 
state, pensioners and the unemployed, education, science, and 
culture, our compatriots in the Srpska republic and the republic 
of Serbian Krajina, and refugees who sought refuge in our 
republic. The established framework for public expenditure, as 
set out in the program, must under no circumstances be 
interfered with. This means that the government must under no 
circumstances give in to any requests and principles for 
increasing the budgetary expenditure. However, the Assembly 
also bears its part of the responsibility for this. We should 
not insist on legislation that would impose new obligations on 
the republic, and for which funds have not been earmarked in the 
budget. The same type of restriction should also apply to tax 
exemption. No tax relief can be approved unless its scope is 
established, and the lost budget revenue is made up for in other 
ways. There is room for decreasing public expenditure. The 
Constitution has transferred to the republic many of the 
functions that used to be in domain of municipalities or various 
self-management associations, alliances, organizations, 
institutes, and chambers. Thanks to inertia, much of this 
unnecessary load has been maintained until today. 
  Many of these unnecessary expenses stem from irrational 
behavior in the system of the health and education institutions, 
in the governmental apparatus, and elsewhere. The government is 
determined to remove these. Concrete programs will be 
introduced to rationalize and reduce all that cannot be accepted 
in the sphere of public expenditure with our current low 
national income. The same is envisaged for public enterprises. 
Their role is to ensure on an economically sound basis the 
working of the economy and the life of the citizens, and not to 
conceal the multitude of irrationalities and weaknesses behind 
their frequently monopolistic behavior. 
  A policy of balancing the budget must be implemented in 
order 
to increase public income. I believe that every tax measure of 
the government will come under a critical gaze, and the 
government will treat such criticism responsibly. However, the 
government will stand firm when it comes to everyone having to 
pay tax, provided of course that taxes are in line with the 
economic ability of the taxpayer. 
  On the other hand, citizens have to know where their money 
is 
going, and how even the last dinar is spent. The government 
will abide by the proposals and programs suggesting that tax 
rates should not be increased, but rather that the tax base and 
the number of taxpayers be extended. 
  In implementing the policy of balancing the budget, the 
government is determined to establish the strictest of budgetary 
disciplines, and will cooperate closely with the Federal 
Government and the Montenegrin Government. That is why we call 
on you deputies in this Assembly, and the public in general, to 
extend your full support to this policy. 
  The policy of healthy currency will represent the main 
impetus to all the economic activities and the realistic 
increase of the social product in stable conditions. Without 
much involvement or sponsorship by the state and its bodies, 
room will be made for free entrepreneurs and economic 
initiative. The places where realistic economic calculation is 
possible are places where solid production and successful trade 
will also be possible. In other words, the aim of the 
government is to create an atmosphere in which the market 
motivation for production will strengthen. 
  I beg you for your attention. You will have a chance, 
colleagues deputies, to participate as much as you like later on. 
  Instead of having illusions about production and new 
investment based on the currency issue, a market system will be 
created in which everyone will be motivated and economically 
forced to produce and sell as much as he can. The bitter 
experiences of the last few years have taught us that motivating 
production from the primary issue inflicts the most damage on 
that very production. Another chance should not be given to 
those who still do not believe this. Such lessons have already 
cost too much. For that reason all companies will have to 
establish themselves on the grounds of realistic economic 
criteria. None of them should expect any more state subsidies 
from the budget or the currency issue. They should themselves 
become an important source of budgetary income and new 
investment. I suggest to companies that expect this, rather 
than through their own production, that they will find a 
solution in state subsidies and [word indistinct] directly or 
through the trade union, that they should immediately change 
their managers, since the government will not accept any 
financing without backing or any other form of deviation from 
the program. 
  A healthy economy, even if it is temporarily poor, still has 
great possibilities to exploit the resources available and 
become rich, while an unhealthy economy that is financed without 
backing can never become that. That is why there is no 
alternative to the policy of a healthy and stable currency, and 
that is why the government will not give up on this policy at 
any cost. 
  The government's agricultural policy will also be in line 
with the spirit of the fundamental commitments in the program. 
This means that the agriculture and the food industry will be 
placed in the same conditions of production as other fields, 
there will be full equality of all property relations, and 
stimulative measures will be introduced that will motivate the 
merging of agricultural property and the development of farms, 
by giving full freedom to the development of co-operatives, by 
securing protection prices for the basic agricultural products, 
and by introducing other forms of development motivation. Here, 
too, there can be no return to financing without backing. 
Agricultural production will be supported only from realistic 
resources and with firm guarantees. 
  With the aim of stimulating production, better supply, and 
strengthening the position of the new dinar, the most important 
issue now is the increase of traffic, both by accessing reserves 
and by exchanging companies' foreign currency for new dinars. 
The government shall insist that the process of exchanging 
companies and banks' foreign currency is expedited without any 
administrative restrictions in order to make it possible for 
production and trade to -- on the basis of their financial 
potential -- acquire fresh funds necessary for carrying out 
business functions. [sentence as heard] Those companies that 
already have good programs should be given immediate support. 
They should immediately begin realizing these programs, 
including production for export. However, the impression is 
that some of the banks have still not adapted to these 
conditions. The measures of the monetary policy should 
establish conditions for banks to respect the need for 
reasonable real interest rates, and as soon as possible. That 
is one of the key prerequisites for increasing production on 
market principles. The settlement of debts and the 
reinstatement of trust in banks and other financial institutions 
is to a significant degree linked to solving the problem of old 
foreign currency savings. Serbia will not allow a single one of 
its foreign currency savers to be deprived of his or her foreign 
currency investment or its value in dinars. Concrete solutions 
for this problem will be proposed in a relatively short while. 
The moving of social policy outside the domain of the company 
and, based on this, the strengthening of their competitive edge 
is a very important aim of the entire program. It is known that 
a great number of temporarily unemployed workers objectively are 
not participating in the production process and that this has 
been so for some time. They are now essentially receiving 
welfare from their companies. The state, and not the company, 
must secure welfare and security for the citizens and the 
unemployed. The state must primarily help the workers who have 
been laid off by helping them to change their professions and 
through alternative employment. Moreover, paying out the income 
of unemployed workers in the form of welfare taken from the 
state budget rather than the companies would represent a more 
rational solution, if nothing else because it would eliminate 
the costs that arise from keeping in business unprofitable 
companies and fictitious employment. However, we are not 
focusing on laying off the surplus of employees. We are talking 
about a gradual process of structural changes with a stress on 
an active policy of new, real rather than fictitious employment 
of people, along with respecting the fact that there are people 
among the employment who have their own capital -- land or other 
sources of income -- and who are taking up the places of those 
for whom their jobs are the only source of income. The 
government will be actively involved in the process of 
collective negotiating about salaries that goes on between labor 
unions and the chamber of commerce. However, we wish to have the 
smallest possible amount of administrating and regulating. 
[sentence as heard] Salaries within the economy as a whole 
should be freely formed, and it is up to the government to -- in 
accordance with the budget restrictions -- regulate salaries in 
businesses that do not produce anything in and public companies. 
  The initial phase of the program primarily focuses on the 
revival of the national currency. However, at the same time, it 
marks the beginning of a lasting revival of the economy. Once a 
market ambience is established -- its basic outlines -- the 
state will have its real role in regulating economic life. The 
state will devote itself to organizing and protecting the 
economic and civil organization and the basic market 
institutions, which -- along with conducting economic policy -- 
is its basic, but in our society neglected, role. What we have 
in mind here is primarily the protection of contracts and 
property, and the protection of the monetary and fiscal systems, 
institutions of the goods, labor, and capital markets. 
  In connection with this, I call on the Federal Parliament to 
pass, as soon as possible, crucial economic and systemic laws 
that will put into operation the market economic conditions. 
[sentence as heard] These are primarily laws on companies, 
employment, the capital market, and the transformation of 
property. We shall propose a new law [words indistinct] which 
we believe will be democratic, publicly controlled, and socially 
acceptable. 
  The basic principles on which this law will be based are 
the autonomy of the companies in making decisions on the 
transformation of property, the realistic value of the capital, 
the openness of the model, and the stimulative quality and 
justness. 
  As for the regional development policy, the government -- in 
accordance with the program -- will implement it in such a way 
that it will primarily insist on the activation of the number of 
already built but unexploited capacities. At the same time the 
government will concentrate resources for the development of the 
infrastructure primarily in the underdeveloped regions in order 
to create favorable conditions for potential investors. In the 
context of such a development policy, the particular advantages 
will be given to Kosovo and Metohija, but we have to stress that 
the program does not allow exceptions so the failure to use the 
existing capacities cannot be replaced by constant demands for 
new investments. 
  The control functions of the state are of a particular 
importance for the implementation of the program. The 
government will prepare a special program for the organizational 
and the personnel strengthening of the inspections and the 
finance police. Control of the monetary and the criminal sphere 
will be conducted together with the Federal Government, which 
will hamper the illegal transactions and trade. 
  As for the judiciary, which is to provide the necessary 
protection for citizens-entrepreneurs and therefore the program, 
the changes in the Federal and Serbian legislature will provide 
for the radical sanctioning of economic and financial offenses. 
  The safety of the citizens and the security of their 
property 
will be in future, too, a priority of the government. The 
previous activities of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the 
extremely complex conditions of neighboring war, have secured a 
stable security situation in the republic. Further 
modernization and the constant adjustments of this service to 
the changes in the country and around is a task the government 
will deal with regularly. 
  Esteemed peoples' deputies, by devoting itself to the tasks 
that the executive authorities have in a legal state, the 
Serbian Government will make every effort -- in accordance with 
the law and the Constitution -- to carry out the responsibility 
it has taken on at this difficult moment to implement the 
program of monetary reconstruction and the economic recovery of 
our country together with the Federal Government and the 
Montenegrin Government. The program, which has been built on 
the basis of a market economy, has drawn a line between the 
competences, treating all sectors of economy equally. The 
success of the reform demands from everyone to respond to the 
duties in their line of work. This means that the economy will 
have to turn to the production and to rely fully on its own 
initiatives and entrepreneurship. The social services will have 
to show a greater degree of responsibility and efficiency. The 
state administration will have to work more expertly and react 
more quickly in eliminating the obstacles in the consistent 
implementation of the program, and a higher degree of readiness 
in fighting crimes of all kinds, and in eliminating war 
profiteering. 
  The citizens are given a particularly important role. 
Without their full confidence, their acceptance of the program, 
and their understanding for the inevitable teething 
difficulties, without their response to their tax and other 
duties, the implementation of the program would undoubtedly 
encounter further difficulties. Because of the serious changes 
it brings with it, the program has -- in my opinion -- 
historical importance. It has such importance particularly as a 
means for the defense of the sovereignty of the country. It has 
taken great courage for us to commit ourselves to a convertible 
dinar at times of an economic blockade, and succeed in defending 
it. 
  For its part, the Serbian Government stresses its firm 
resoluteness in persevering in the consistent implementation of 
the program of monetary reform and economic recovery. The 
government is aware that the organization of the governmental 
bodies has to be improved, and they have to be made responsible 
for carrying out tasks. In line with that, the government will 
undertake a series of operational measures and will organize a 
system to observe the implementation of the program in order to 
react promptly to transgressions as they occur. 
  I am convinced that we are all aware of the difficulties 
connected with this task, and of the significance of the period 
before us. None of us has any illusion that differing views and 
attitudes can be avoided in a democratic assembly between 
political parties, and in accordance with that, that this 
program and the policy based on it will easily get the necessary 
support here. I have to stress, however, that economic life 
itself has almost imposed such a program as an alternative to 
the chaos of hyperinflation and complete collapse with 
unpredictable economic, social, and political consequences. 
That is why I call on all the parties and the deputies on the 
behalf of the government to cooperate on this program, whose 
main orientation must not be questioned at any time. 
  The serious efforts that the government has to put in in the 
next few months and years to achieve economic revitalization are 
indeed necessary in order to alleviate the effects of the 
sanctions. These efforts will continue to be necessary even 
after the sanctions are lifted in order to avoid economic and 
political chaos, to protect domestic production from 
unprincipled rivalry from outside, and to provide all those 
market, production, and financial rules that are necessary for 
an economy to become more successful. 
  However, these great and imperative efforts concerning the 
economy that the government must undertake should also be 
accompanied by similarly great and imperative efforts in other 
spheres of social life -- health, education, science, culture, 
and information. 
  The international blockade undermined not only the economic 
life in Serbia but the social life as well, and for this reason, 
related efforts are needed. The international blockade 
definitely brought about a stagnation in the development of 
science, the provicialization of culture, education that is 
excessively turned exclusively toward the national and the past, 
and subjectivity and defeatism in the dissemination of 
information. These are the occurrences that more or less cannot 
be avoided under the conditions of a major international 
blockade. Other countries in a similar situation would have 
behaved in a similar manner. 
  Under the current circumstances, it is not our task to 
contribute toward the sanctions with our own behavior and, while 
the sanctions last -- even though justly infuriated by the world 
-- not to turn our back to the world and remain isolated and 
lonely for longer than the sanctions have been imposed. In 
education, for example, we must make an effort at every level -- 
from schools to universities -- to link ourselves to the 
greatest achievements and best experiences in the developed 
world. The aim of this linkage would be to prepare the young 
generation for professional and intellectual activity and for 
work and life in the third millennium. 
  Education must rid itself as quickly and as seriously as 
possible of the pathetic orientation toward the national, 
especially toward the national past. Isolationism in education 
is more dangerous than economic isolationism. Its consequences 
are reflected in the ideas of the youngest generations and last 
long after the ideas and practice of isolationism have passed. 
Through education, the young generation must be made capable of 
working and living in the coming era. It must be capable of 
criticizing this era, but also of critically promoting it and 
loving it. 
  At this moment, science has been entirely exposed to the 
danger of stagnation. Despite the lack of material and 
financial resources and the interruption of numerous 
institutional and personal links abroad, and despite the 
confusion, disillusionment, and even opportunism that can be 
encountered in the humanistic sciences, the government will make 
every effort to secure greater material and financial resources 
for the development of science in faculties and institutes, to 
restore scientific links with Europe and the world that can be 
restored, despite the sanctions, especially once the sanctions 
are lifted, and to encourage scientific work in the sphere of 
natural and social sciences with a policy of grants, the 
publishing of scientific publications, and the creation of an 
overall atmosphere that science to a great degree holds the 
answer on how to lead a richer and more humane life today and in 
the future. 
  Culture as a whole is also a victim of the sanctions, the 
war 
encirclement, and all the consequences brought on by the 
country's disintegration. The creation of artwork has been 
endangered, as well as their interpretation and conveyance to 
other people. The conditions for artistic creativity, as well 
making artistic and cultural heritage accessible to as many 
people as possible, especially young, must be radically changed 
in a positive sense. Just like education, the arts and sciences 
must turn to the present and the future, to the world, and to 
other cultures. They must free themselves from the domination 
of the past, which threatens to make the cultural life 
provincial and autarkic. 
  Radical changes must especially be implemented in the sphere 
of information dissemination. This is often dominated by the 
air of pessimism and defeatism, bourgeois, and superficial 
attitude toward society and its problems, especially toward 
solutions for these problems. The dissemination of information 
is partially responsible for the impression that everyone in the 
world is against the Serbs and that for these and other reasons 
we do not need anyone. This impression is naturally unfounded. 
It is not true that everyone is against the Serbs, as it 
equally not true that the Serbs can exist by themselves as an 
economical, political, and cultural Robinson Crusoe, at least 
not if they want to be successful and happy. 
  Information dissemination must be made more objective, 
versatile, and cultured regarding our country and foreign 
countries. It must bring back optimism to the public, at least 
to an extent to which it has lessened it. Despite all our 
problems, there is no reason why this optimism could not be 
realistic. This country and these people have preserved energy, 
dignity, and hope under the conditions of sanctions, while this 
government, knowing and respecting this energy, dignity, and 
hope, will do everything to free us from the sanctions, and 
[word indistinct] to live humanely as much as we can under the 
sanctions. The government has a duty to do this because of the 
Serbian citizens and especially because of the young generation, 
which wants to live in peace, freedom, and prosperity and which 
is willing to make its contribution toward this peace, freedom, 
and prosperity. However, it must make its contribution through 
education, work, and creativeness. 
  Such a determination of the young generation is our biggest 
asset. I end my expose in a desire to preserve this wealth and 
increase it further. [applause]

<F P=106> [Report by Zoran Vaskovic from the Serbian Assembly] </F>
  [Text] The Serbian Assembly has continued the discussion 
on the government's program and composition as proposed by Prime 
Minister-designate Mirko Marjanovic yesterday. Zoran Vaskovic 
reports from the Assembly: 
  [Vaskovic] Eleven deputies took part in the discussion this 
morning. Their speeches, and the speeches by another 50 
deputies still to speak, indicate that the debate will be long 
and polemic. With one exception, all the speakers were deputies 
from the opposition parties. They expressed the objection that 
the proposed program is too general and that it does not stand a 
chance of being implemented. They also demanded further cuts in 
the budget. The deputies from the opposition parties stressed 
that the cabinet of Mirko Marjanovic is not a government of 
national unity, as he had tried to achieve. 
  The only member of the ruling party who spoke today was 
Zoran 
Andjelkovic. The essence of his speech was that the opposition 
has not achieved any results in the communes where they won. 
  Let us repeat: We are facing a long debate, after which the 
deputies will vote on the new government. In order to be 
elected, the government needs at least 126 votes. Aleksandra 
Jankovic is currently addressing the Assembly and some 50 more 
deputies are still to speak. That is all from the Serbian 
Assembly.

  [Text] Athens, 15 Mar (TANJUG) -- The peace negotiations on 
Bosnia must return to being under the auspices of the European 
Union [EU], Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic, 
said in an interview to Greek reporters in Pale. Radovan 
Karadzic said, the progovernment newspaper TA NEA reports, that 
he would soon visit Athens and suggest to Greek Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou that solutions to the war in Bosnia should be 
regarded as the EU's priority task. Karadzic will demand of 
Papandreou that Greece, in its capacity as EU president, should 
press for restarting the Geneva peace negotiations. As TA NEA 
stresses, the president of the Srpska republic expressed 
disappointment with the fact that the United States has taken a 
lead in resolving the crisis in Bosnia by bypassing the United 
Nations. Radovan Karadzic said he would like to see a solution 
for Bosnia taking place within Greece's EU Presidency mandate. 
Asked by Greek reporters about his views on the West's 
continuing habit of stubbornly bringing pressure to bear on the 
Serbs and threating them with military action, Karadzic said the 
Serbs would no longer accept any ultimatums. In Karadzic's 
words, the recent NATO ultimatum was knocking on an open door as 
it was a well-known fact that three days before that the Serbs 
had agreed to demilitarization with the UN secretary general's 
special envoy, Yasushi Akashi. The Greek reporters asked 
Karadzic about his opinion of the crisis between Athens and 
Skopje. The president of the Srpska republic regards Athens' 
policy towards Skopje as correct. He stressed that The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] has a future only if it 
joins the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in some form of 
confederation -- something that would ensure the preservation of 
its integrity.

  [Text] Belgrade, Mar 15 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic said on Tuesday that the Serbs were prepared to 
give up 16 percent of the territory they control in Bosnia. In a 
statement to REUTERS, Karadzic underscored that Serbs currently 
control 72 percent of the territory in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "We 
are ready to give up some Serb territory for peace but certainly 
not a big amount. I think that we will keep 56 to 57 percent of 
the territory." Karadzic said he expected the United States, 
which brokered the Croat-Moslem agreement of a federation, to 
guarantee that the alliance would not be anti-Serb. 
  American and Russian peace envoys underscored that the Serbs 
hold the key to a solution of the Bosnian conflict and Karadzic 
reiterated that Bosnian Serbs do not intend to boycott 
negotiations. "We will certainly join the talks," Karadzic said 
but did not specify when. "We do not reject talks about some 
loose association or some ties on the space of former Yugoslavia 
between former and newly-founded Yugoslav republics," Karadzic 
said.

<F P=106> [Interview with President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina </F>
Presidency Alija Izetbegovic by Zdravka Soldic; place and date 
not given: "Only People Who Have a Guilty Conscience Resist 
Confederation"] 
  [Text] Croatian journalists have not had the chance 
to interview the President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency 
Alija Izetbegovic. President Izetbegovic would always refuse to 
talk to them. A day after the preliminary agreement on forming 
a federation of the areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina with 
Bosniak-Muslim and Croat majorities was signed, the president of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina agreed to give an interview to NEDJELJNA 
DALMACIJA, the Croatian political weekly. 
  [Soldic] Mr. President, how did you take the signed 
preliminary agreement on forming a federation in areas of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with majority Bosniac and Croat populations? 
  [Izetbegovic] With mixed feelings of hope and doubt. I do 
not think I have to explain the reason for my ambiguous 
feelings. If you have good intentions, you will take the news 
with hope, if you are also realistic, you will have many reasons 
for doubt and apprehension. But, for me, it was good news after 
a long time. 
  [Soldic] On whose initiative did this agreement come about? 
  [Izetbegovic] This time, the United States took the 
initiative and they got strong support from Germany, Turkey, 
Austria, and some other Western and Muslim countries. But you 
surely remember that I made a similar proposal sometimes last 
summer. It was during a dinner-party Lord Owen gave in his 
Geneva residence for [Croatian President] Tudjman and myself. 
There were only the three of us there, but my proposal was 
published in the Croatian press, I think. Mr. Tudjman refused 
the proposal at the time. 
<H5>  Mr. Tudjman and I Behind the Scenes </H5>
  [Soldic] Which Bosnian, Croat, and international factors 
participated in making this proposal? 
  [Izetbegovic] Our delegations, headed by [Foreign Ministers] 
Silajdzic and Granic participated directly, and, naturally, Mr. 
Tudjman and I behind the scenes. I influenced some solutions in 
the agreement, but my role was more one of insisting on looking 
for and finding solutions. I do not know exactly what President 
Tudjman was doing, but I presume he had a similar role. Our job 
was made easier by the fact that Silajdzic and Granic are very 
competent and good negotiators, but I still think that, without 
the active involvement of the United States, we would not have 
got very far. The fact that Christopher, Gore, Redman, and even 
President Clinton himself were actively involved in this says a 
lot. 
  [Soldic] This agreement foresees an organization on a 
cantonal basis, i.e., the idea of creating ethnic ministates was 
completely abandoned. Will cantons have national 
characteristics and how many cantons will there be in the 
federation in the Bosnia-Herzegovina areas with Bosniak and 
Croat majorities? 
  [Izetbegovic] We could say that the concept of ethnic 
ministates was thereby relinquished. However, cantons will 
mostly be national. I could say national, but not ethnically 
pure. Regard this, the area of central Bosnia is a specific 
case, because the population is mixed, or better yet, turned 
upside down, as if there had been a demographic earthquake. I 
have already mentioned the initiative I presented last summer on 
a joint state of the Muslims and the Croats. I was specifically 
motivated at that time by central Bosnia, i.e., the insolubility 
of that area. I felt that we would continue to fight hopelessly 
for this area because we instead on dividing it, and this is 
where I was, unfortunately, right. And regarding the number of 
the cantons, we still do not know yet, but I believe there will 
be between seven and nine cantons. 
  [Soldic] How much territory will the future cantons take? 
  [Izetbegovic] One of the introductory provisions of the 
preliminary agreement gives an answer to this question, in a 
very general manner, and says that the federation is formed in 
areas with Muslim and Croat majorities. I think that would be 
about 60 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Soldic] How do they intend to solve the problem of the 
areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina controlled by Karadzic's Serbs? 
  [Izetbegovic] In short: The agreement is akso open to the 
Serbs. If they do not want to accept that, they can opt for the 
union option from the Geneva concept. What I am trying to say 
is that they can chose from several variants, provided that 
Bosnia-Herzegovina remains an integral country or, to be more 
precise, provided that the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina do not 
change. 
  [Soldic] Can you explain the division of responsibility 
between central and cantonal authorities? 
  [Izetbegovic] I recommend that your readers read the 
relevant provisions of the preliminary agreement. They are very 
clear and need no additional explanation. We can say that the 
proposed solution is characterized by a relatively strong 
central authority, with the wide competence of cantons, 
especially regarding questions of specific national interest. 
We could generally say: The state provides joint interests and 
cantons protect national interests. 
<H5>  Solutions Specific Like Bosnia </H5>
  [Soldic] What is the planned national structure in the 
central and cantonal authorities? 
  [Izetbegovic] Those are various combinations of the 
principle of parity and the principle of proportion. Parity is 
planned for the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, as it is a very 
important body, and in the House of Nations. The proportion 
principle will be applied in the Chamber of Representatives and 
"something in between" in the federal government (at least 30 
percent of ministerial seats are reserved for Croat deputies), 
while, in the cantons, all organs are established on a 
propertional basis. 
  [Soldic] When will the constitution of the federation be 
adopted? 
  [Izetbegovic] The draft constitution is being established in 
Vienna. After the agreement is signed, it is planned that it 
will be ratified by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly. Therefore, 
we are planning a legal way of transforming the state from the 
present constitutional system to a new one. 
  [Soldic] Does the present agreement foresee the presidential 
system? 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, to some extent. However, that will not 
be a purely presidential system. I would rather call it a 
combination of presidential and parliamentary systems. On the 
other hand, the majority principle, or the rule of the majority, 
which always characterizes a parliamentary system of authority, 
has been significantly amended or limited by a two-chamber 
composition of the future assembly, where the second chamber, 
the House of Nations, requires consensus, and so forth. All in 
all, a specific solution, as specific as Bosnia itself. 
  [Soldic] Does the present agreement abolish the previously 
signed agreement on the EC administration of Mostar? 
  [Izetbegovic] No, during the last hours of the talks, just 
before the agreement was signed, we agreed that the European 
Union would temporarily be in charge of Mostar. 
  [Soldic] Do the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Croats, 
lose the right to dual citizenship acquired a year and a half 
ago as a result of this agreement? 
  [Izetbegovic] No, they do not. 
  [Soldic] What do you think about the preliminary agreement 
on the principles and basis for founding a confederation between 
the Republic of Croatia and the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Izetbegovic] I support that project. As you know, the idea 
was developed much earlier than the Washington agreement. 
  [Soldic] You have probably heard that a part of the 
Croatian public resists that idea, as well as the idea about a 
joint state with the Muslims. 
  [Izetbegovic] I know, I have heard that. Resistance comes 
from those who have a guilty conscience and are deeply involved 
in this senseless conflict between the Croats and the Muslims. 
They fear the truth will come to the surface once the war is 
over. Naturally, there are those who are not well-informed -- or 
who are misinformed. Let me give them some information: More 
than 10,000 Muslims actively participated in the Croatian Army 
in the war of 1991. Many have never returned to their homes, 
and I personally prevented 25,000 to 30,000 of our men joining 
the "JNA" [Yugoslav National Army] to go to the Croatian front 
during the war. It was in August, 1991, when our Presidency -- 
although Serbian deputies were opposed to it and in spite of the 
protests, and even threats, of the former JNA -- forbade any 
further mobilization of young Bosnian men to the JNA. One 
should not forget those things, although it seems to me that 
some of your people have a Freudian loss of memory. Anyway, I 
know the views of most Croatian intellectuals on this question, 
the way the Catholic Church thinks, and even the views of 
relevant political factors, those in the authorities and those 
from the opposition. I am well-informed and pleased about that. 
  [Soldic] Does Croatia get the right of transit through Neum, 
the territory of the federation? 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, it does, without restrictions, as if 
there were no borders. That is reciprocal: Bosnia gains 
similar rights on the communication line from Ploce to the 
Bosnian border. This is, of course, of the greatest practical 
value for the future confederal relations between the two states. 
<H5>  "I First Thought About Roads..." </H5>
  [Soldic] What can refugees expect from this normalization of 
relations between the Croats and the Muslims, i.e., between 
Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Izetbegovic] I mentioned one of our motives for this 
arrangement. That is the problem of central Bosnia. The 
second, more important, one -- perhaps the most important one -- 
concerns refugees. Conflicts between us and the Croats have 
completely marred the prospects for their return. All roads 
were closed. There seemed to be no way out. You asked me -- I 
think that was your first question -- how did I take those 
signatures in Washington. Let me tell you what I thought first 
when I heard the news about the signing of those documents. I 
thought about the roads that would be opened and the thousands 
of our people who would use them to run to their homes. You do 
not know how much they desire that. I know, I was with them, I 
saw it. Thank God for this sudden glimmer of hope.

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, March 16 (AFP) -- The Moslem-led 
Bosnian Government and Bosnian Serbs were to initial an 
agreement at Sarajevo airport on Wednesday [16 March] for the 
opening of roads around the Bosnian capital. Three corridors 
have been chosen which, once open, will have the effect of 
partially lifting the Serb siege of Sarajevo. One will pass 
through the Serb-held industrial suburb of Vogosca to reach 
central Bosnia via the Moslem town of Visoko, 25 kilometres (15 
miles) from here. The other two routes will link the Serb 
suburbs of Ilizda and Lukavica and the Bosnian suburbs of Butmir 
and Dobrinja, passing through the airport which is in the hands 
of the UN Protection Force. Once initialled, the agreement is 
due to take effect from Saturday, for civilian and commercial 
traffic. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] will have to be given 
24-hour notice of transport of merchandise, which it will 
communicate to the two sides, and the entry and exit points will 
be under UN guard. 
  In other areas, Bosnian Serb troops continued to defy a 
United Nations Security Council demand Monday to lift their 
nine-month siege of the northern Moslem enclave of Maglaj to 
allow access for humanitarian convoys. Aid has been unable to 
reach Maglaj by road since October. The besieged communities 
have since then been forced to rely on air drops. [passage

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 15 (AFP) -- The office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) denounced Tuesday 
[15 March] the Bosnian Serbs' continued refusal to allow 
humanitarian aid convoys from reaching the besieged Bosnian town 
of Maglaj. UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler said his agency's 
repeated requests to the Serbs to allow humanitarian convoys 
into the north Bosnian town have so far fallen on deaf ears. No 
relief convoys have managed to get into the enclave, which 
shelters about 100,000 people, since October 26, when two UNHCR 
Danish drivers were killed. Since then the UN has carried out 
food air-drops over the region, some of which have missed their 
target, Kessler said. 
  Radio Sarajevo reported Monday that Serb troops had fired 
upon a group of people trying to retrieve some of the food but 
the UN, which helicoptered 10 British liaison officers into the 
enclave Sunday, was unable to confirm the report. The radio also 
reported that the Serbs had shelled the town on Tuesday. 
  Meanwhile a UNHCR aid convoy was waiting in the central town 
of Zenica for the Serbs to give it the green light to head to 
Maglaj, some 80 kilometers north (50 miles). The convoy of about 
10 trucks is being escorted by British peacekeeping troops. 
  Kessler said although Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic 
has given his approval for the passage of the convoy, local Serb 
authorities say they have received no word from their superiors. 
  The Maglaj region has become one of the hottest spots in 
Bosnia in recent weeks as the Serbs intensified their 
stranglehold on the enclave, formerly linked to territory held 
by the mainly Moslem Bosnian army and Croat troops. Bosnian 
military leader Hasim Sedic said the situation in the region 
escalated last June when the Bosnian army and Croat defense 
forces (HVO) -- allies until then -- began fighting. The Croats 
subsequently formed an alliance with the Serbs in order to 
isolate the Moslems. 
  Sadic added that since the March 1 Moslem-Croat accord to 
form a federation, the HVO has adopted a "passive" attitude 
concerning the fighting in the Maglaj region. He said the Serbs 
have some 80,000 troops deployed around the enclave and have 
helicopters and heavy artillery at their disposal. This could 
not be independently confirmed.

told SRNA that raving Muslim propaganda was only creating false 
hopes that something could be achieved militarily in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, since the world had at long last understood 
that it had been fed with lies. Commenting on the refusal by the 
UN Security Council last night to declare Maglaj "a protected 
zone" and Butrus-Ghali's explanation that "the Muslims in Bosnia 
abuse the UN-protected zones," Gvero said the international 
community had finally decided to examine the actual situation on 
the ground in Bosnia-Herzegovina realistically. "Experience so 
far has shown that each time the Muslim forces find themselves 
in a militarily hopeless situation some international circles 
get involved and turn the situation to their advantage," Gvero 
said. 
  Describing the UN concept of protected zones as "completely 
wrong," Gvero recalled that, according to international law, a 
protected zone was a demilitarized territory where "soldiers 
protect unarmed people, and not a combat formation which, by 
abusing the UN protection, turns protected zones into combat 
hotbeds where all means are used to threaten the Serb state."

  [Text] Zagreb, March 15 (AFP) -- Sadako Ogata, the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], expressed grave concern 
Tuesday over the fate of 100,000 civilians in the besieged 
Bosnian enclave of Maglaj. Following talks here with Croatian 
Foreign Minister Mate Granic, Ogata said the situation in the 
northern Moslem enclave, which has been under siege from Bosnian 
Serb forces for nine months, was "of great concern to us." 
  Bosnian Serb troops continued Tuesday to defy a United 
Nations Security Council demand issued a day earlier to lift the 
siege immediately to allow access for humanitarian convoys. Aid 
has been unable to reach Maglaj by road since October. The 
besieged communities have since then been forced to rely on air 
drops. Ogata said Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, whom she 
asked Tuesday to "exert his influence" over the besieging 
forces, had promised to look into ways of resolving the impasse. 
"I'm doing my very best to get access to this pocket. This is a 
very important urgent measure to take," for the 100,000 
civilians deprived of necessary aid inside the enclave, she 
added. The Bosnian Serbs' continued intransigence was "really 
against the promise that the three parties, including very much 
the Serbs, have given me on November 18th." On that date the 
warring parties pledged to halt fighting in and around the 
Maglaj pocket to allow aid convoys access. Ogata stressed that 
the humanitarian situation in other parts of Bosnia had 
"improved enormously." "I do have to give recognition to all the 
parties in that sense," she added. "Conditions on the ground in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are improving a great deal, and we are able 
to deliver (aid) much, much more easily all over the country." 
  Ogata is due to travel to Sarajevo Wednesday morning for 
talks with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Bosnia's UN 
Protection Force commander, General Sir Michael Rose. Wednesday 
afternoon she is hoping to visit both Croat and Moslem sectors 
of the southern Herzegovina city of Mostar. 
  Ogata is due back in Geneva late Thursday after inspecting a 
sector of northern Croatia placed under UN protection.

  [Text] In an interview for the Austrian TV station ORT2 
following yet another round of Vienna negotiations, Bosnian 
Prime Minister Dr. Haris Silajdzic said: I am glad that the 
Bosnian-Croatian talks took place in Vienna. The Austrian 
Government has invested a great deal of energy and effort to 
ensure that peace is reached. We genuinely hope for peace 
rather than war. We hope that human rights, mentioned in the 
draft constitution, will become reality: the right to life, to 
freedom, to free movement, to differing views. 
  Asked to comment on the deployment in Bosnia-Herzegovina of 
Russian troops as part of the UN contingent, Dr. Silajdzic said: 
I was in Moscow three days ago. I was open about my concern at 
the way the Russians have become involved. Several weeks ago 
Zhirinovskiy visited the aggressor's territories and made 
nationalistically charged speeches. Soon afterwards Russian 
troops arrived in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bosnian Government was 
not consulted. The Russian troops have been deployed at 
locations in Sarajevo as well. We fear that Sarajevo will be 
divided. We fear a new war there. We shall do our utmost to 
ensure that a new Berlin wall is not erected there. We are, 
nevertheless, concerned. 
  Asked how stable the foundations of the new Bosnian-Croatian 
trust are and if they could be undermined again in view of the 
fact that until recently the two people have been engaged in a 
bloody war, Silajdzic said: Everything is possible. The crucial 
point is that a stable cease-fire, especially in Sarajevo and 
Mostar, has come about as a direct result of the current rounds 
of negotiations. This gives us encouragement and strength to 
persevere. We hope for the best, Prime Minister Silajdzic said 
among other things.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 16 March carries in its 
regular 10-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in 
the republic. 
  Reporting on the situation in Maglaj, Hajrudin Sermic says 
that "the town underwent the heaviest shelling last night 
between 2000 and 2100, when one person was killed and four were 
wounded. The unequal war that [Serb military leader Ratko] 
Mladic's gunners are waging against the Maglaj people is 
continuing in the face of international indifference." 
  Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac that "last night after 
1930 the Serb aggressor intensified his artillery and tank 
attacks on the [word indistinct] and Bihac regions. They also 
attacked the other parts in the operational zone of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina [B-H] Army 5th Corps and the Bihac HVO 
[Croatian Defense Council]. One women carrying a child was 
killed in Bosanska Otoka, and several other people were wounded. 
Over the last 24 hours, the chetniks have been targeting the 
defensive positions in Grabez and the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau 
with howitzers from Gorija." He says that "the chetniks are 
again bringing in new forces as they cannot reconcile themselves 
to their inability to capture the railroad and the road 
alongside the Una River in order to connect their two fictitious 
parastates." 
  In his report from Bugojno, Emir Avdakovic says that "after 
several days of relative quiet, early this morning the chetniks 
from their positions in Koprivnica again started firing tank and 
howitzer shells at the town. The general alarm was sounded and 
the Bugojno people are now in their shelters." 
  Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko that "our positions were 
last night targeted by howitzers, tanks, and mortars. A chetnik 
122-mm howitzer from the direction of (Tresnjica) was firing at 
the central sector of the Brcko defense. From Sumari an enemy 
tank was firing at Jasici and Boderiste." He says that this 
morning there is "heavy sniper fire at the defense lines." 
  The B-H Army 3d Corps Press Center says that "even though 
they have occasionally violated the cease-fire with some small 
arms fire, the HVO has shown over the last few days that they do 
want peace in this region. The same cannot be said for 
Karadzic's chetniks, since they have been preparing for attacks 
on almost all the fronts held by the 3d Corps. To judge by the 
intensive movement behind their front lines, the chetniks are 
not giving up on Zavidovici and the southern corridor. Apart 
from significant movement of their motorized vehicles and 
military hardware, they have been keeping up their provocative 
artillery and small arms fire." The reports says that "yesterday 
extremists from the HVO violated the cease-fire several times 
with 12.7-mm sniper rifles in the region of Bistrica. Even 
though it was quiet in the Lasva Valley, two nights ago a [HVO] 
unit of 40 to 50 soldiers moved the front line a little by 
entrenching in (Busovacke Staje), thus violating the cease-fire 
agreement."

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1000 GMT on 16 March carries in its 
regular 5-minute newscast three further reports on the fighting 
in the republic. 
  Updating the situation in Bugojno, Atif Agic says that "the 
chetniks from Donji Vakuf and Kupres have been shelling the town 
fiercely since this morning. The army groups from Operative 
Group West have been resisting all these attacks, and they even 
launched counterattacks on some parts of the front. As of today 
it is units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina [B-H] Army that are in 
control of Mala Suljaga, where they have also seized one T-55 
tank. These good fighters of the B-H Army have inflicted heavy 
losses on the chetniks in terms of manpower. In retaliation for 
this morning's defeats, the chetniks have turned their guns on 
the residential parts of Bugojno. The general alarm has already 
been sounded several times but the chetnik shells were faster 
with the result that one civilian has been killed and six 
wounded so far." As for Gornji Vakuf, he says "the cease-fire 
between the B-H Army and the HVO is holding surprisingly well." 
  Enes Ratusic reports from the B-H Army 4th Corps that "there 
have been no serious military activities to violate the 
cease-fire between the B-H Army and the HVO in the 4th Corps' 
theater of operations. However, provocations by some extreme 
HVO individuals and groups have not entirely ceased." He says 
that "there has been some heavier fire in the northern sector, 
particularly in the area of (Bijelimici), where the chetniks 
used tanks against the defensive positions of the B-H Army and 
civilian targets in the surrounding villages." 
  In his report from the Zvornik front, Nijaz Banjanovic says 
that "the chetnik artillery fell silent yesterday evening, so 
last night and this morning have been marked only by the usual 
small arms fire directed at the defense lines of the 206th 
Chivalrous Brigade."

  45 percent -- a political government 
  55 percent -- a government of no political coloring (made up 
of technocrats)

decide to form a government with other political parties, what 
parties would you like it to form a government with? 
  60 percent -- with the opposition parties 
  40 percent -- with the allied parties

  Do you think that quiet will prevail in Romania in the next 
six months or not? 
  55 percent -- there will be quiet 
  45 percent -- there will be no quiet

  [Text] The Washington accord and the course of the Vienna 
talks give us every reason to believe that the senseless war 
between the Croats and the Bosniaks is finally over; whatever 
ensues, the fact remains that this accord has saved lives. This 
was underlined by U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith at 
a news conference in Zagreb. He also dwelt on how the agreement 
is reflected in the situation in the field in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and spoke on other points of interest. 
  The accord opens doors to a more comprehensive agreement 
between the Croats and the Bosniaks, which is being discussed in 
Vienna, and to an overall, peaceful solution, he assessed. On 
the basis of NATO's ultimatum and the Washington accord, and in 
collaboration with the European Union, we are determined to give 
the people of this region a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic 
future, Galbraith stressed. 
  President Clinton's Special Envoy Charles Redman said that 
work on further rapprochement between the Bosnian Croats and 
Bosniaks lies ahead, as well as work on the improvement of the 
humanitarian situation in Bosnia. He pointed to the significant 
changes in the field in Bosnia compared to the situation three 
or four weeks ago. He said these changes encourage hope for 
great possibilities for reaching a solution. An important step 
to be taken is to include the Bosnian Serbs, because a 
comprehensive agreement cannot be reached without their 
participation, Redman said. He stressed that his visit to 
Belgrade yesterday, when he met Milosevic and Bosnian Serb 
officials, was a preliminary step. I explained what we have 
accomplished so far and what we hope to accomplish, he added. 
  Assessing as productive and constructive yesterday's 
meetings 
with President Tudjman, Minister Granic, and other Croatian 
Government officials, ambassadors Galbraith and Redman 
underlined their positive and constructive role. 
  Asked about guarantees for the integration of the 
UN-protected areas, Redman said he believed this process is 
creating conditions for a stable situation in the region, not 
only for peace in Bosnia, and providing better ways for 
resolving the remaining issues -- including the UN-protected 
zones in Croatia.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Not every one had the 
opportunity to listen to the ideas presented in an earlier 
interview by Jozef Moravcik. We are therefore repeating some 
of the more important parts of his interview. 
  [Begin recording] [Moravcik] I am now faced with the most 
important step, and that is to form the new government. I am 
fully concentrating on this task. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you already have a concept 
concerning the composition of the new government? 
  [Moravcik] Such a concept has been taking shape for some 
time. I cannot say more about it right now because negotiations 
with representatives of the parliamentary parties concerned are 
still going on. The composition of the new government should be 
completed tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. 
  [Reporter] When do you want to submit the composition of the 
government for the president's approval? 
  [Moravcik] I think this could happen on Wednesday [16 
March]. 
  [Reporter] Does it mean that you want the 27th parliamentary 
session to continue with the new government? 
  [Moravcik] It would be desirable. 
  [Reporter] Are you working on your policy statement? 
  [Moravcik] I will submit the policy statement at the next 
National Council session. 
  [Reporter] As a former foreign minister, how do you 
visualize 
the person of the future foreign minister? 
  [Moravcik] I think it should be a career diplomat. I am 
approaching the issue from this starting point at the moment. 
  [Reporter] Do you have anyone tipped for this post? 
  [Moravcik] Naturally, I do. 
  [Reporter] In your interview for Slobodny Piatok [Free 
Friday], you said that you were close to the ideas of the 
Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic. Does that mean 
that their ideas will determine your course and that you will 
work with this party? 
  [Moravcik] We want to create a joint political party. 
  [Reporter] Does it mean that the party being called the 
Democratic Union, whose creation has been proposed by Roman 
Kovac, is going to be the joint party with the Alliance of 
Democrats? Or are these parties going to be two different 
political parties and you, in that case, will choose just one of 
them? 
  [Moravcik] It is possible that another party will be 
involved. That means that three or possibly four parties will 
merge. 
  [Reporter] Which three or four parties of those you have 
just 
mentioned might participate in such a merger? 
  [Moravcik] Perhaps you should add Cernak [former chairman of 
the Slovak National Party and founder of the National Democratic 
parliamentary club] and maybe another body, although that is no 
more than an idea at the moment. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister-designate Jozef Moravcik by </F>
an unidentified correspondent; place and date not 
given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] [Passage omitted] The previous 
government decided that state secretaries would leave their 
posts. Are you going to fill these posts, or will the new 
ministers abolish the decision made by former ministers? 
  [Moravcik] This decision made by the government is very 
unusual and is very strange. I think that our people could and 
should assess this measure and form their own opinions on the 
matter. We have not decided yet to rectify this decision made 
by the government. We want to have proposals this week so that 
we can fill the posts of state secretaries and heads of offices. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] From the citizens' point of view, the 
content 
of government activity will be the priority. What will be the 
priorities of the government? 
  [Moravcik] The government will have only a limited period 
for 
its activity. The basic trends of its activity are already 
clear to us. The order in which I am going to list them does 
not necessarily mean what priority they are given. 
  The new government will have to secure political 
stabilization and the calming down of the political scene. It 
will have to secure the normal operation of state administration 
and to stop the deterioration in some aspects of its activity. 
The government will have to focus on the economy because that 
is important for all other areas. I have said several times 
already that it is important to stop the negative trends that 
are becoming clearly visible in the economy, and to lay 
foundations for the new government to build on these foundations 
after elections. 
  [Correspondent] The tasks that you have listed indicate that 
they will include measures that will be not very attractive to 
voters. Hence, from the point of view of a voter, this 
government may become less interesting. How do you view your 
role? Is it really going to be only until the next elections? 
  [Moravcik] We believe that a realistic picture of Slovakia 
and especially of its economy should be presented. I think 
that, when a citizen gets such a true view of the reality, he or 
she will understand measures that are inevitable to secure a 
certain positive development of society after new elections.

<F P=106> [Article by Slawomir Popowski from Moscow: "Optimism Without </F>
Specifics; Another Meeting Between Polish and Russian Prime 
Ministers in May"] 
  [Text] The "face-to-face" conversation between 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Polish Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak lasted much longer than expected during 
Pawlak's working visit to Moscow. If one were to believe the 
chiefs of governments, the visit's most important goal was 
achieved: Problems that are obstacles to economic cooperation 
were defined with precision, while individual ministers were 
obliged to come up with proposals for solutions by May of this 
year. The prime ministers for both countries will meet again in 
two months--it is very likely that this time the meeting will 
take place in Warsaw--in order to sign the necessary 
agreements. 
  It seems that both politicians were interested in breaking 
the impediments that have been in effect for many months now, in 
economic relations between Poland and Russia. According to 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, the situation requires a speeding up of 
work on putting financial problems in order, on working out new 
payment mechanisms, and on regulating the issue of mutual 
indebtedness. 
  Prime Minister Pawlak was also full of optimism. In his 
view, thanks to the cooperation between the two governments, a 
prospect for signing trade agreements for years to come is 
realistic, including signing a trade protocol before the end of 
this year. The most important issue, said the Polish 
government's chief during a short meeting with journalists, is 
that the declarations and agreements signed earlier actually be 
implemented. That is indeed the essence of a "Partnership for 
Development" concept proposed by the Polish Government. The 
point is to create conditions that would make it possible to 
establish practical cooperation among countries and nations. 
  While responding to a question pertaining to the resolution 
of a key issue within Polish-Russian economic cooperation--that 
is, the issue of indebtedness--Prime Minister Pawlak said the 
issue will be further debated by experts. Old debts should in 
no way be an obstacle to current cooperation. Viktor 
Chernomyrdin shared that view. Economy Minister Aleksandr 
Shokhin was more skeptical. According to him, solving the 
problem of mutual indebtedness requires a political decision at 
the level of prime ministers or perhaps even at the level of 
presidents. After negotiations with the two previous Polish 
cabinets, which lasted years, a few more compromise solutions 
must be worked out, to be able to eventually "finalize the 
issue." Henryk Chmielak, secretary of state in the Finance 
Ministry, said that both sides have agreed to apply the payment 
mechanism used in talks with the Paris Club. 
  At the end of the Polish-Russian talks, which were conducted 
in the rebuilt wing of the "White House" (old headquarters of 
the Supreme Council), where Chernomyrdin's Cabinet has moved, 
both prime ministers signed two agreements: regarding employing 
Russians in Poland and employing Poles in Russia, and an 
agreement on cooperation regarding antitrust policies. An 
agreement on agriculture was also signed. 
  During the meeting between the prime ministers in May, the 
following agreements may be signed: regarding military and 
technical cooperation (this allegedly is supposed to be on 
cooperation among arms factories, with third markets in mind), 
on joint transportation ventures (Berlin-Warsaw-Moscow highway 
and railway), and on a Russia-Europe natural gas pipeline.

  After his return from Moscow, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
said that President Lech Walesa will be the first to hear from 
him regarding the results of Pawlak's conversations with Russian 
politicians. According to the government's chief, the most 
important part of the visit was about determining a time frame 
for subsequent contacts aimed at signing an agreement on 
supplies of strategic raw materials that would last for many 
years. According to Marek Pol, minister of industry and trade, 
there is a chance for signing an agreement concerning pipeline 
construction. That venture would be financed exclusively by 
Polish and Russian companies.

  [Excerpts] Zagreb, March 15 (AFP) -- UN General Jean Cot, 
speaking to journalists Tuesday [15 March], called for the right 
for the military to use air strikes in Bosnia without going 
through current cumbersome administrative procedures. His 
comments came as Washington and Paris accused the United Nations 
of lacking the will to use air strikes, after Serb attacks on 
French UN troops over the weekend. 
  Cot, the outgoing commander of the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) in former Yugoslavia said he noted that authority to 
order "close air support" had passed from the Secretary General, 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, to his special envoy in Zagreb Yasushi 
Akashi. "I am convinced it is necessary to go further, and in 
some clearly outlined, clearly defined cases authority should be 
given to the military, which is not irresponsible," the French 
general said at a press conference to introduce his successor 
General Bertrand de Lapresle. 
  Cot has long demanded the right to order airstrikes and his 
insistence largely prompted his dismissal by Butrus-Ghali in 
mid-January. De Lapresle, using more guarded language, agreed 
that "there are cases which justify a very rapid response, not 
to make war but to guarantee our most important right, that of 
legitimate self-defence." [passage omitted] 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe assailed the United 
Nations on Monday for its slow response, saying, "One must act 
faster and be more determined." French Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur, who visited Bihac on Sunday, strongly criticized "the 
often overly long delays, (and) the too heavy administrative and 
political procedures" preventing immediate retaliation when blue 
helmets come under fire.

  [Excerpt] Tirana, March 11 (ATA) -- On March 10, the 
delegation of the North Atlantic Assembly headed by its 
president, Louis Bouvard, had a meeting with the chairman of the 
Commission on Defence, Public Order and National Information 
Service (NIS), Azem Hajdari. Mr. Hajdari spoke about the 
commission and the work of the parliament in support of the 
democratic reforms and discussed new legislation passed by the 
parliament. Mr. Bouvard appreciated the great work carried out 
by the commission in revising Albanian laws, which are now 
completely different from those which existed under the 
communist regime. Further on, Mr. Bouvard spoke of the role of 
the North Atlantic Assembly he directs, in the field of defence 
and security of its member countries. "I am also happy for the 
unanimous efforts of the member countries of our alliance to 
accept Albania as an associate member in the pact. We consider 
it a moral obligation toward your country because you have 
suffered for 50 years under a communist dictatorship. Our 
alliance follows attentively the efforts of the people of 
Kosova, led by their honoured President Rugova, under Serbian 
occupiers, in defence of their human rights." Mr. Bouvard also 
underlined the efforts of the alliance not to allow a spillover 
of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina toward the south. [passage

Meksi; place and date not given: "`Frascino Question: 
Responsibilities Rest on Those Who Caused Damages to the 
Albanian Economy' -- Interview With Premier Meksi"] 
  [Text] Tirana, March 16 (ATA) -- In an interview with ATA, 
Albanian Premier A. Meksi said that with the canceling of the 
contract with the Italian firm Frascino, the responsibility 
rests on those who have signed the irregular agreement in 
circumstances which perhaps need to be investigated. Due to the 
cancellation of the contract, the International Arbitrage Court 
decided that Albania must pay a fine worth 48 billion and 289 
million lira. "With the price for the compensation of the site, 
the value of the site referred to in the contract amounts to 
nearly 100 million dollars. We could not allow that someone 
become owner of a site through an irregular agreement reached 
with the Albanian Government of that time," Mr. Meksi said, 
adding that the task of the governments is to put right 
irregular actions. 
  Regarding different comments in the press about the fine 
that 
the Albanian Government has to pay, Mr. Meksi said that he could 
not realise why the press treats the present government which is 
restituting an ownership to the Albanian people and not those 
who caused these damage to the Albanian economy. With regard to 
the prospective of the issue, Mr. Meksi said: "Our jurists and 
other experts will consider the best legal solutions for Albania 
concerning this unjust question which has damaged the country's 
interests. We hope that a positive solution will be found."

  [Text] Sofia, March 16 (BTA) -- In connection with plans 
by Greece and Turkey to send peacekeepers to Bosnia, Bulgarian 
President Zhelyu Zhelev sent a message to UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, the President's Press Office said tonight. 
Zhelev reiterated Bulgaria's stance for non-intervention in the 
war in former Yugoslavia and its call on the other Balkan and 
neighbouring countries to refrain from such intervention. The 
Bulgarian position is motivated by the fact that the Balkan 
countries are burdened with their past and any military 
intervention in the former Yugoslavia on their part, even if 
prompted by the noblest of motives, would arouse old suspicions 
and hostility. According to the Bulgarian president, such a 
development would aggravate the situation in the Balkans and 
increase the danger of a new Balkan war.

  [Text] Sofia, March 15 (BTA) -- The Government Commission 
on UN Sanctions met today with its head, Deputy Prime Minister 
Evgeni Matinchev, in the chair. The meeting was attended by 
Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov. The commission was briefed 
on the incident involving the Khan Kubrat by Interior Ministry 
Chief Secretary General Kosta Bogatsevski, First Deputy Foreign 
Minister Valentin Gatsinski, Deputy Finance Minister and Chief 
of the General Customs Directorate Khristo Kulishev, and Deputy 
Transport Minister Kharalan Kharalanov. The commission adopted 
extra measures for the prevention of violations of the UN 
Security Council sanctions against the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). 
  Each department concerned with the incident will call to the 
strictest account its employees who were officially involved in 
the application of sanctions in this particular case. 
  The Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance and Transport 
were 
given until March 18, 1994 to work out a plan of action in 
similar situations. The same ministries were assigned to 
submit, by March 21, a draft act of government introducing extra 
measures for the enforcement of sanctions and the imposition of 
temporary restrictions on the handling of liquid fuel in the 
Bulgarian Danube ports. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will draft and send the UN 
Sanctions Committee answers to questions already posed to the 
Republic of Bulgaria in connection with the application of UN 
sanctions against the FRY (Serbia and Montenegro). 
  The commission will approach the Prosecutor General's Office 
for assistance in the enforcement of the UN sanctions against 
the FRY (Serbia and Montenegro). 
  The UN Security Council blamed the FRY government for the 
accident. In a statement, the Council welcomed the Bulgarian 
Government's cooperative treatment and called on it to 
investigate the actual circumstances of the action and to bring 
the culprits to justice. 
  On January 31, the ship pushing barges laden with diesel oil 
was detained on suspicion of sanctions busting. It slipped out 
of Bulgaria on the night of March 3 and docked at the Serbian 
port of Prahovo on March 6 to unload. It was arrested on its 
return to Bulgaria on March 13. 
  Upon the arrival of the Khan Kubrat, all 21 persons on board 
were arrested. After questioning at the Regional Directorate of 
Internal Affairs in Vidin (on the Danube, Northwestern 
Bulgaria), 18 of them were released. The ship's captain, first 
mate and engineer remain in custody. Five of the sailors told 
the BTA local correspondent that the ship had been hijacked from 
the port of Somovit by persons of unidentified nationality. 
Five persons armed with rifles and automatic pistols and 
wearing white hoods together with Rumen Stoykov, president of 
the Rutoplast Company of Petrich (southwestern Bulgaria) and one 
Mitko, boarded the ship on the night of March 3 to 4, the 
sailors said. According to a log record, Rumen Stoykov took 
over command of the ship as from March 4, they specify. When 
the ship sailed past Vidin, the gunmen herded part of the crew 
out on the deck and lined them up with their hands behind their 
heads. 
  In the Serbian port of Prahovo the gunmen disappeared 
mysteriously, and when the local police and customs arrived, 
they found neither the hijackers nor the weapons on board, the 
sailors said. Minutes before the Khan Kubrat started back with 
its six empty barges by 11 PM on March 12, Rumen Stoykov and his 
colleague Mitko got off at the port of Prahovo, the sailors said. 
  A team of investigators from the National Investigation 
Service left from Vidin for Sofia today, taking along the 
captain, first mate and engineer of the Khan Kubrat, the BTA 
correspondent reports. The chief of the Regional Directorate of 
Internal Affairs in Vidin Nikolay Dechev told a news conference 
that he expected the investigation into the case to be completed 
soon.

  [Text] Sofia, March 16 (BTA) -- Organized crime is 
involved in the incident with the Bulgarian ship "Khan Kubrat" 
which in early March transported 6,000 tonnes of diesel fuel to 
Serbia in violation of the Yugoembargo, Mr. Reiner Beussel, head 
of the Sanctions Assistance Mission (SAM) in Bulgaria, told 
journalists today at the Government's Press Office. 
  On the night of January 30 "Khan Kubrat" was detained by a 
team of the Western European Union after the captain did not 
stop for inspection. The ship was sailing upstream very slowly 
with its lights off and was suspected of attempting to violate 
the embargo. According to Mr. Beussel, an inspection showed that 
the shipping documents were in order and that the destination of 
the convoy's cargo was Romania. When on March 6 the ship left 
Bulgarian territorial waters in the direction of Serbia it was 
not stopped by force because it was believed to have been 
hijacked. What is more, the hijackers, or the people who 
presented themselves as such, threatened to blow up the barges 
or to leak fuel into the Danube which would have led to an 
environmental catastrophe. The investigation is still working 
on the case and the possibility of the hijacking being a sham 
one has not been ruled out. According to Mr. Beussel some shady 
circumstances indicate a sham hijacking but the possibility that 
the crew was forced to sail at gunpoint also remains. 
  The incident with the "Khan Kubrat" can be repeated any 
time, 
Mr. Reiner Beussel told the press conference. According to him, 
this is because the customs authorities cannot stop suspicious 
deals, the law does not allow them to confiscate goods or 
vessels because the law does not consider a violation of an 
embargo a crime. All other countries enforcing the embargo are 
experiencing similar problems. Mr. Beussel expressed 
satisfaction with the cooperation of the Bulgarian Government 
and authorities in monitoring and enforcing the embargo. 
  The SAM mission disposes of information about 200 attempts 
at 
violating the embargo from the Bulgarian side which are now 
being investigated by the competent authorities. These are 
cases of forged documents, attempts at bribing etc. However, 
Mr. Beussel said he had no information on how many of these 
cases constituted actual violation of the embargo. Mr. Beussel 
believes that in Bulgaria corruption has not reached the higher 
echelons of power but it strikes one that civil servants of 
lower ranks are driving quite expensive cars. At the same time 
the SAM missions have registered about 1,000 attempts at embargo 
busting from the side of Bosnia and as many from the side of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. 
  Five people are now in custody in the investigation of the 
incident of the "Khan Kubrat," Mrs. Ani Kruleva, Director of the 
National Investigative Service told BTA today. They have been 
charged with exceptionally large size smuggling. 
  Asked of his opinion on the case, Prosecutor General Ivan 
Tatarchev told BTA that he believes the hijacking to be a sham 
one.

<F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, March 16 (BTA) -- The political problems 
resulting from Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's illness are in the 
highlights of today's press. KONTINENT writes that Mr. 
Aleksandur Pramatarski, vice president of the Democratic Party 
in the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), told its National 
Coordinating Council yesterday that a cabinet crisis is to be 
expected on March 21. The commentary goes on to say that the 
problem with the cabinet will most probably be solved before the 
national conference of the SDS in May and the new government is 
likely to be headed by Georgi Markov of the Democratic Party, 
who recently left the parliamentary SDS to become an independent 
MP. This situation is another godsend for the SDS, reads the 
commentary in KONTINENT. Yesterday President Zhelev and SDS 
leader Filip Dimitrov had lunch together but refused to comment 
on their meeting, writes 24 CHASA, quoting the Balkan News 
Agency. Actually, the SDS is not seeking to provoke a cabinet 
crisis, or is at least trying to postpone it because it is not 
ready for elections, reads an article in STANDART NEWS. "A 
diseased government cannot run a diseased state," writes the 
Bulgarian Agrarian Party's daily ZEMEDELSKO ZNAME. Now there is 
no one responsible for this country's government, says a 
commentary in the SDS daily DEMOKRATSIYA headlined "BSP Alone Is 
Blind to the Crisis". EKSPRES writes that the prime minister's 
wife told BSP leader Zhan Videnov over the phone that Professor 
Berov hopes to return to his office soon. The Socialist DUMA 
daily writes that the prime minister's illness has made the SDS 
put off its national conference until May. The same daily 
quotes the deputy chairman of the National Coordinating Council 
of the SDS, Mr. Stefan Sofiyanski, as saying that Deputy Prime 
Minister Valentin Karabashev and the acting Prime Minister 
Evgeni Matinchev are squabbling while this country is 
suffocating in a tightening economic knot. 
  [Sofia Khorizont Radio Network in Bulgarian at 1100 GMT on 
16 
March reports two statements by a spokesperson of the SDS 
National Coordinating Council and by presidential spokesman 
Valentin Stoyanov, both denying that President Zhelyu Zhelev and 
SDS leader Filip Dimitrov held any meeting in Sofia on 15 May. 
Stoyanov is reported to have said that "the Balkan News Agency 
report on any meeting between President Zhelev and Filip 
Dimitrov is incorrect from beginning to end."]

<F P=106> [From BTA's 17 March press review] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sofia, March 17 (BTA) -- Today's DUMA and 
DEMOKRATSIYA, the dailies of the two major political forces in 
Bulgaria, lead with articles commenting on the possible 
consequences of Prime Minister Berov's illness for the 
government and the state. Last Friday [11 March] Prime Minister 
Berov underwent a quadruple bypass operation. In the absence of 
the prime minister parliament cannot exercise its right of 
control over the executive because under the Constitution the 
prime minister is solely responsible for his cabinet's policy, 
DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), 
writes. The bill moved by National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur 
Yordanov for amending the Constitution envisages a possibility 
for one quarter or more of the MP's to move for an early 
dissolution of parliament when parliament is unable to exercise 
control over the government. The Constitution provides for a 
dissolution of parliament only when it fails to form a cabinet. 
The bill adds to the characteristic features of the state as a 
parliamentary republic, DEMOKRATSIYA writes, expressing the 
belief that it would be realistic and sensible for the majority 
in parliament to support such a change in the Constitution. 
  In its leader the socialist DUMA writes that President 
Zhelyu 
Zhelev invited former Foreign Minister Stoyan Ganev to head a 
caretaker cabinet, citing no source. According to this daily, 
the two of them met in Paris last week when the head of state 
paid a three-day visit to the French capital to attend the 
UNESCO commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the rescue of 
the Bulgarian Jews. It is hardly probable that the president's 
busy schedule would have allowed for such a meeting to happen, 
presidential spokesman Valentin Stoyanov told DUMA. After this 
possible meeting, however, the president "started a shuttle for 
recruiting candidate caretaker ministers", DUMA writes citing 
unnamed reliable sources. The frequently mentioned as candidate 
prime minister Dimitur Ludzhev (former deputy prime minister and 
present leader of the New Policy Centre centrist formation) is 
no longer a favourite of the president's because of his strong 
ties with Bulgarian and foreign business circles", DUMA writes. 
  "Academician Blagovest Sendov Is Ready To Form a Cabinet", 
reads the headline of the leader in OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK today. 
KONTINENT runs similar information. After his meeting yesterday 
[16 March] with the leader of the ethnic Turks' Movement for 
Rights and Freedoms (DPS) Ahmed Dogan, the academician, who was 
deputy in the Grand National Assembly, said that he is ready to 
take the post of prime minister should the political forces 
desire this. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Prague, March 16 (CTK) -- New Slovak Prime 
Minister Jozef Moravcik was born on March 19, 1945. After he 
completed law studies in Prague and Bratislava he lectured at 
the School of Economics and worked shortly at the Bratislava 
Chemapol chemical company. 
  Since 1972 he lectured at the Faculty of Law of Komensky 
University in Bratislava. In the years 1990-91 he was its dean. 
In January 1991 Moravcik filled a vacant seat in the Slovak 
National Counil (parliament) representing the Public Against 
Violence (VPN) movement. When the VPN split in 1991 he joined 
the HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia]. From April to 
June 1992 he was a member of the Slovak National Council 
presidium. 
  In the June 1992 elections Moravcik was elected an HZDS 
deputy to the House of the People of the Federal Assembly 
(parliament) and in July he was appointed federal foreign 
minister. He held the post until December 1992 when the 
Czechoslovak Federation ceased to exist. In 1993 he became a 
legislative adviser to Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar. He was 
appointed Slovak foreign minister on March 19, 1993, to replace 
Milan Knazko (then HZDS) who was fired after long-term disputes 
with Meciar. [passage omitted] 
  Moravcik made clear his opinion that a political structure 
compatible with the political structure common in Western Europe 
should be created in Slovakia. He warned that the HZDS did not 
have a partner in the West and said this was "a certain 
handicap." He also claimed he sympathized with the social 
democratic orientation.

  [Text] Prague, March 16 (CTK) -- Roman Kovac, who has 
become Slovakia's new deputy prime minister for the non-economic 
sphere, was born in 1940, and in 1963 graduated from the Medical 
School of Charles University in Plzen, west Bohemia. 
  He was an expert assistant in a Gynaecological and Maternity 
Clinic in Bratislava, and later director of the Medical Bionics 
Research Institute in Bratislava. From September 1990 to March 
1992 he was chairman of the Czech and Slovak Confederation of 
Trade Unions, and deputy chairman from March until June 1992, 
when he was elected a deputy of the House of Nations of the 
former Czechoslovak federal parliament. He was then appointed 
deputy prime minister of the Slovak Government and Minister of 
Inspection, holding the latter post until September 1992. 
  In the first round of presidential elections in the 
independent Slovakia, Roman Kovac was the unsuccessful HZDS 
[Movement for a Democratic Slovakia] candidate. In relation to 
his candidacy as president, his relationship with the Communist 
Party of Slovakia (KSS) came into the foreground. In 1989 he 
was a Communist Party candidate, but did not become a member. 
Other sources say he actually became a member but was not able 
to collect his membership card before the events of November 
1989. 
  Roman Kovac is married. His wife Lubica is also a physician, 
and they have two children. 
  Kovac handed his resignation as deputy Slovak prime minister 
in the former Vladimir Meciar's government to President Michal 
Kovac on February 25, an admission of defeat in a battle with 
Meciar over policy formation in the governing Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). 
  Roman Kovac, once Meciar's right hand man, fell into the 
prime minister's disfavour when he started to express himself 
independently and without warning. 
  Among the first signals that Roman Kovac had got into 
Meciar's bad books was a letter from the district board of the 
HZDS in Vranov nad Toplou, east Slovakia. The board wrote that 
"we have already registered, on June 10, 1993, our disagreement 
with the activities of the deputy prime minister, and we stick 
by them." 
  In an interview for NARODNA OBRODA on December 20, 1993, 
Kovac said that not only between him and the prime minister but 
between him and the government there were various opinions on 
the solution of problems. In the interview he also said that he 
had reservations concerning Meciar's style of work in the HZDS. 
An acceptable solution to the Slovak political situation, he 
said, would be a wide coalition government with HZDS 
participation. 
  The disputes within the movement culminated at the meeting 
of 
the HZDS Deputies' Club on February 10 in Casta-Papiernicka, 
west Slovakia. This was where Roman Kovac announced the 
formation of the breakaway Alternative of Political Realism, 
backed by nine deputies and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik. 
The Alternative proposed the formation of a broad coalition 
government without political leaders including Meciar. The HZDS 
National Board called an extraordinary meeting on February 12, 
at which it did not express political confidence in Kovac and 
Moravcik, and proposed that they be expelled from the party. It 
also recommended to Meciar that they be dismissed from their 
government posts. 
  On February 15, Meciar asked them to leave a cabinet 
meeting, 
and a day later wrote to President Michal Kovac proposing their 
dismissal. Roman Kovac and Moravcik said they would only step 
down in accordance with a presidential decision, and that they 
were prepared to continue their goverment responsbilities. As 
reason for their refusal to leave they said that by doing so 
they would be condoning the charges which Meciar had made 
against them. Nonetheless, Moravcik handed in his resignation 
yesterday, as did Kovac today. "Minister Moravcik and I have 
decided to made the president's decision easier, partly in an 
aim to prevent the deepening of the confrontation between the 
Castle and the government," Kovac said about his decision. 
  The HZDS Bratislava-Old Town District Board had decided by 
secret ballot on February 11 to cancel Roman Kovac's membership.

  [Text] Prague, March 16 (CTK) -- Ivan Simko, the present 
deputy chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), was 
today appointed deputy chairman of the new Slovak Government in 
charge of legislative affairs. 
  Simko entered politics as a member of the KDH, which now 
again becomes a government party, and which he co-founded in 
early 1990. His post-November political activity was preceded by 
numerous activities under the communist regime (toppled in 
November 1989). During his studies in Bratislava, Simko, along 
with local Catholic circles, helped establish Christian-oriented 
communities of young people. 
  Ivan Simko, doctor of law, was born on January 1, 1955 in 
Bratislava. In the late 1970s he graduated from Bratislava's 
School of Economics. He was shortly employed in economic 
research, later worked in the Department of Bratislava's Chief 
Architect. In the mid-1980s he studied, without leaving his 
job, at the Law School of Bratislava Comenius University, from 
which he graduated in 1987. 
  In January 1990, he was invited by Jan Carnogursky, then 
deputy prime minister of the new Czechoslovak Government, to 
work in his secretariat, where he stayed until the first free 
elections in June 1990. He was elected a deputy to the House of 
the People of the then Federal Assembly. He headed the 
Parliamentary Defense and Security Committee, and was a member 
of the Assembly's Presidium. He held the deputy's post until the 
next elections in June 1992. In 1991 he was elected as 
Czechoslovakia's representative to the European Parliament. 
  A few months before the June 1992 elections, the KDH 
proposed 
Simko to the vacant post of Slovak justice minister. Between 
March and July 1993, he was deputy chairman of the Legislative 
Council of the Slovak parliament. 
  Since late 1992, when the Federal Assembly terminated its 
operation (in connection with the split of Czechoslovakia into 
two independent republics), Simko, a member of the KDH 
leadership, has been working for the KDH. At the 5th KDH 
congress in September 1992, he was elected a party's deputy 
chairman.

  [Text] Prague, March 16 (CTK) -- Economist Rudolf Filkus, 
whom the preceding government dismissed from the post of Slovak 
ambassador to Austria last year for what it called unloyal 
behavior, was today appointed finance minister in the new Slovak 
cabinet. 
  After being stripped of the post of ambassador, Filkus was 
expelled from the then ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS) and entered the Alliance of Slovak Democrats (ADSR), 
headed by the former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko. 
  Professor Rudolf Filkus was born on September 2, 1927 in 
Bratislava. After graduating from the School of Economics he 
worked for 20 years in the Economy Institute of the Slovak 
Academy of Sciences, which he had to leave for political 
reasons. In 1972-1989 he worked in the Price Research Institute 
and the National Economy Central Institute. In 1990, after the 
fall of communism in the country, he returned to the Economy 
Institute. 
  From January to June 1990, Filkus was a deputy to the House 
of the People of the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly, elected for 
the Public Against Violence (VPN) movement. From August 1990 to 
May 1991 he held the post of minister for economic strategy. 
After the split of the VPN he joined the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), and between July 1991 and March 1993 
he chaired the HZDS Council. From June to December 1992 he was 
an HZDS deputy to the Federal parliament's House of the People. 
From July to December 1992 he was the first vice-premier of the 
Czechoslovak Government, (proposed by the HZDS), and minister in 
charge of the management of the Federal Inspection Ministry. 
  In March 1993 Filkus was appointed Slovak ambassador to 
Austria. On August 24 he was dismissed from the post at the 
initiative of then Premier Vladimir Meciar for what Meciar 
called "repeated unloyal behavior toward the executive body of 
state power". Filkus handed his resignation from the post to 
President Michal Kovac on September 13, saying he did not want 
to nourish the tension between Kovac and Meciar. 
  On September 22, the authorized HZDS district body decided 
on 
Filkus's expulsion from the movement. In November 1993 Filkus 
entered the ADSR and soon became its deputy chairman.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 16 (CTK) -- Slovak President 
Michal Kovac said tonight the new Slovak Government should prove 
that Slovakia was a consolidated, stable, and democratic country 
which creates conditions for cooperation with any solid 
political and trade partner. 
  Appointing the new government, Kovac called on the new 
cabinet members to carry on the processes of transformation 
which have already yielded positive results. But he supported 
"a search for matter-of-fact solutions where the steps taken by 
the previous government were politicized." 
  Kovac explained Vladimir Meciar's dismissal by disagreement 
with "the autocratic method (of work) of the prime minister and 
some government members." He rejected their tendency to 
concentrate power and defended democracy and morality in 
politics. At the same time he praised Meciar's contribution to 
the shaping of Slovak statehood. 
  Kovac said he considered the Hungarian parliamentary 
parties' 
support for the new government an "expression of loyalty towards 
the Slovak Republic." 
  One of the major tasks of Moravcik's government is lessening 
"the incomprehensible and dangerous hostility between various 
groups of citizens," Kovac said.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 16 (CTK) -- New Slovak Prime 
Minister Jozef Moravcik supported on Wednesday [16 March] the 
development of special relations between the Czech Republic and 
Slovakia. 
  "We must try to do something to solve the still pending 
questions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia," he told 
journalists after his appointment. He particularly pointed out 
the need to settle property issues and the question of the 
border regime. 
  Moravcik, until recently chief of Slovak diplomacy, praised 
Slovak-Czech foreign political cooperation. "I greatly 
appreciate Czech diplomacy's support which has helped assert 
Slovak interests in many questions," he stressed. 
  Turning to the possibility of meeting Czech Prime Minister 
Vaclav Klaus, Moravcik said talks on this level had to be well 
prepared.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 16 (CTK) -- The new Slovak 
Foreign Minister and Slovak UN representative Eduard Kukan said 
today that he was "partially surprised" by his appointment. 
  "Here in the USA we have been following in detail the 
development of events in Slovakia. However, it was only when I 
read the recent speech by the premier-designate, former Foreign 
Minister Josef Moravcik, to the effect that his successor in the 
ministerial seat should be a professional diplomat, that I 
started to think that he might mean me," Kukan said in a 
telephone interview for Bratislava radio from New York. 
  With regard to his successor in New York, Kukan said he 
favored "a person with sufficient experience" in the foreign 
service. "It is multilateral diplomacy, and experience and 
practice are essential prerequisites," he added. 
  As a Czechoslovak and later Slovak diplomat, Kukan was 
thought highly of for his expert abilities, and CTK sources put 
him in first place during speculations on the new cabinet for 
both these abilities and his closeness to Moravcik. It is 
expected that his activity as Foreign Minister will carry on 
directly from the policy of his predecessor which was generally 
considered pragmatic and pro-Western.

  [Text] Washington, March 16 (CTK) -- Relations with the 
Czech Republic remain Slovakia's priority number one, newly 
appointed Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan told CTK before 
his departure from New York on Wednesday. 
  Kukan, Slovakia's permanent representative to the UN up to 
date, said Slovak-Czech relations were good and that it was 
necessary to rule out beforehand any possible disputes. 
  Slovak diplomacy will also continue to focus on the gradual 
integration into European structures, creation of good 
neighborly relations and contribution to the country's economic 
development, Kukan said. 
  He said he would also see to the most effective possible 
functioning of the existing diplomatic representations abroad 
whose staffs are limited due to financial reasons. In this 
connection Kukan did not rule dismissals of some diplomats.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 16 (CTK) -- Slovakia's new 
Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus said on Wednesday [16 March] that 
stabilizing macroeconomic as well as microeconomic indicators 
was the chief task of the finance ministry. 
  Speaking to reporters shortly after being appointed to the 
post, Filkus said no miracles could be expected of the new 
government. 
  "Slovakia must reach a market economy as quickly as 
possible," he said and added "we must stop indulging in reveries 
about the existence of some third way (of economic development)". 
  Filkus said it would be necessary to de-politicize the 
privatization process which, he said, had become a tool for the 
political concentration of power. The law on large 
privatization ought therefore to be amended, he said. 
  Referring to the state budget deficit, Filkus said that 
budget revenues had considerable reserves in the form of unpaid 
taxes, duties and in the area of financial control. 
  Filkus said he expected soon "to visit all necessary 
ministers and friends in the Czech government".

  [Text] Bratislava, March 16 (CTK) -- It is not difficult 
to proclaim the independence of the courts, but it is a problem 
to actually ensure this independence, new Slovak Justice 
Minister Milan Hanzel told CTK in an interview this afternoon. 
Hanzel was state secretary in the Justice Ministry under 
ex-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's government. 
  "We have to create the right conditions for an independent 
judiciary, and to safeguard its function financially," Hanzel 
said. The problems of courts which had no money for electricity 
and stamps had to be solved immediately, he said. 
  "However, the lack of finances in the judiciary should not 
be 
connected with the pay of judges," Hanzel said, adding that he 
believed that judges' pay was commensurate with that of other 
civil servants. 
  Hanzel said he did not think that Slovakia needed a law on 
the protection of the republic, because the protection of the 
republic and its representatives was sufficiently assured by the 
the legal code. He announced himself in favour of abolishing 
Articles 102 and 103 of the criminal code, which concern the 
defamation of the republic and its representatives. 
  New Defense Minister Pavol Kanis said he wanted to carry on 
with what his predecessor Imrich Andrejcak had successfully 
managed to do concerning the creation of ties with West European 
security structures, and also to solve the problems of young men 
after they entered military service. Kanis is the deputy 
chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL). 
  He added that he too had taken part in the plans bringing 
Slovakia nearer to West European structures, so there should not 
be any problems with continuity regarding the Ministry's 
previous work. 
  "I do not put my own ideas above the needs of society. 
Today, however, it is clear to most people that early elections 
are essential for the calming of society, and these should be 
held in the autumn at the latest," the new defense minister 
said, asked if he could imagine staying in his post until 1996 
which is when elections would take place normally.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 16 (CTK) -- Mikulas Dzurinda, who 
in the new Slovak cabinet is to take the post of minister of 
transport, communications and public works, said today he was 
going first of all to "get the privatization going" of 
communications and railways which had stagnated of late. 
  Speaking to CTK after his meeting with President Michal 
Kovac, Dzurinda said he wanted to proceed according to a concept 
of the development of the Slovak infrastructure which he had 
started before Meciar's government. 
  "I have received signals that a number of privatization acts 
in this field were lately quite strange and I intend to check on 
them thoroughly," he said. 
  "I hold the opinion that a new government should suspend the 
privatization decisions the previous cabinet took after February 
15 and to check them before proceeding to its own activity in 
this field," Dzurinda said. 
  Asked how he intended to solve the conflict of former 
Transport Minister Roman Hofbauer with the Radio Free Europe 
(RFE) Dzurinda said that if it became clear that the outgoing 
cabinet tried to stop RFE broadcasting in Slovakia then he would 
see that it was resumed as soon as possible and the matter 
settled so that RFE could broadcast in the future in an 
absolutely calm atmosphere.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 16 (CTK) -- The new Slovak 
Government of Premier Jozef Moravcik, at its first meeting 
today, dismissed Slovak Police Director Frantisek Krajca and 
appointed Stefan Lastovka new director, Moravcik told 
journalists after the meeting. 
  "It is essential for ensuring full functioning of the 
police," Moravcik said. Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner also 
justified the change of the police director by the stand police 
adopted during the "pro-Meciar" demonstration and the attacks on 
journalists. 
  Slovak President Michal Kovac attended the first cabinet 
meeting. 
  "...The government has emerged from dire necessity to 
overcome the authoritarian method of governing and to create 
conditions for respect and tolerance of citizens... The 
government will orient its activity towards a realistic 
transformation policy, for which a stable economy is a 
pre-condition. It will pay exceptional attention to citizens' 
living conditions and safety and it shares Kovac's appeal for 
political, civic and national reconciliation...," the new 
government said in a statement. 
  Privatization Minister Milan Janicina said that the "wild" 
privatization by Meciar's cabinet in its last days was discussed 
at the meeting. He said that either today or tomorrow at the 
latest "appropriate measures" will be taken but he did not 
elaborate. Privatization will also be discussed by the new 
government on Friday. 
  Moravcik said that filling the posts of the state 
secretaries 
in the individual ministries would be a subject for further 
coalition talks, adding that the opinion of ministers would be 
taken into consideration. 
  Vice-Premier Ivan Simko declined to give details about the 
government-prepared manifesto declaration which, according to 
the constitution, should be submitted to parliament within 30 
days.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 16 (CTK) -- Ex-Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar and four other members of his cabinet, at a 
parliamentary meeting today, for the first time since the 1992 
elections, presented themselves in a new role of opposition 
deputies. 
  With the formal confirmation of the transition of the 
coalition of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and 
the Slovak National Party (SNS) to the opposition the parliament 
house order has also been changed. 
  Since June 1992, of the HZDS 74 deputies only 56 were left 
after the withdrawal of the eight deputies supporting former 
Foreign Minister Milan Knazko, the other eight members of the 
former Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik's Alternative of 
Political Realism, a faction within the HZDS, and the other two 
HZDS deputies who became independent. 
  The transfer of former Deputy Premier Jozef Prokes into 
parliament after he left his post in the government increased 
the number of the SNS deputies to the nine while the opposition 
lost one vote at the same time as Prokes replaced Milan Janicina 
who together with the National Democratic Club of the SNS former 
Chairman Ludovit Cernak went into the camp of Meciar's opponents. 
  The current opposition surrounding Meciar has 67 votes in 
the 
150-member parliament. The camp of the arising government 
coalition could rely on 83 votes at the best while a 
three-fifths majority of votes (90 from 150) is required for the 
key constitutional laws, for example, the law on early 
elections, to be passed in parliament. 
  From the five parties which will be represented in the new 
government, the Democratic Left Party (SDL) is the strongest 
parliamentary party with 28 mandates, followed by the Christian 
Democratic Movement (KDH) with 18 deputies. "The Center Bloc" 
is made of eight deputies from the Alliance of Slovak Democrats 
(ADSR), eight representatives of the group surrounding Moravcik 
and Roman Kovac and five deputies from Cernak's National 
Democratic Club. 
  Egyutteles (Coexistence), a Hungarian minority movement, and 
the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) are also 
participating in forming a new government with their nine and 
five deputies respectively. The new cabinet can apparently also 
count on the votes of Marcela Gburova, an independent deputy, 
and deputy Imrich Mori, who left the HZDS deputies' group. 
  The parliamentary arithmetic reflects, however, just the 
momentarily state of things, which is quickly changing.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 16 (CTK) -- Radio Free Europe 
(RFE) resumed its broadcasts in Slovakia today, at 3:00 PM, 
Director of Slovak Telecommunications Vladimir Ondrovic told 
journalists. 
  He said that the stoppage of RFE broadcasts decided on 
Tuesday by Vladimir Zeman, chief director of the 
Telecommunication Department in the Transport Ministry, was 
unlawful and contradicted the valid agreement. He said that any 
interference in the current state could be made merely by the 
competent parties -- the Slovak telecommunications and RFE. 
  Slovak officials on Tuesday stopped relaying RFE broadcasts 
from two transmitters, in violation of the still valid 
agreement providing for medium-wavelength RFE broadcasts.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 16 (CTK) -- A referendum through 
which representatives of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS) wanted to solve the question of early elections, the 
validity of the mandates of the "disobedient" deputies and the 
"purity" of money used in privatization, will not take place. 
  The 350,000 signatures which, according to the Slovak 
Constitution, are needed for the president to call a referendum 
were not collected during a petition drive organized by the 
HZDS, journalists were told by head of the President's Office 
Jan Findra and Ladislav Orosz from the Office's legislative 
department. 
  During the petition drive, which started in the last week of 
February and lasted until March, 422,054 signatures on 21,000 
petition sheets were collected and submitted to the President's 
Office for checking. 
  A total of 695 sheets were found to be invalid during the 
checking, Findra said, adding that out of the 399,212 signatures 
on the remaining archs [as received] 38,000 signatures were 
illegible and over 36,000 people did not put their first name or 
shortened it. So only 324,321 signatures were recognized valid. 
And after checking addresses of the people who signed the 
petition a total of 232,957 valid signatures were left, which is 
not enough for a referendum to be called. 
  Orosz said that the reason why the petition drive failed was 
that it was the first time that a referendum had been organized 
in Slovakia, its organization was not of the appropriate 
standard and the pace of the collection of signatures was too 
quick.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 17 (CTK) -- The Petition Committee 
which organized a petition drive for a referendum has accused 
President Michal Kovac of "grossly dishonoring the sacred 
constitutional, human and natural rights of citizens" and 
questioning the will of citizens, who did not set their exact 
address in the petition list". 
  In a statement published by the daily REPUBLIKA today, the 
committee says that checking regularity of the petition lists by 
an accounting company is a gross violation of protections of 
citizens' personal data. The committee urges Kovac, "in line 
with the Constitution, the legal order, his conscience and his 
constitutional oath, to enable citizens to realized their basic 
human, civic, political and natural rights". 
  On Wednesday [16 March], the Presidential Office announced 
that the referendum on early elections and other questions, 
pushed for by the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), 
would not take place, since the constitutionally required 
350,000 valid petition signatures had not been attained. 
  The petition drive was launched in late February. On March 2 
the Petition Committee handed to the Presidential Office 21,000 
lists with 422,054 signatures. However, the Presidential Office 
found many of them invalid.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 16 (CTK) -- Chairman of the Slovak 
parliament Ivan Gasparovic said today that a constitutional law 
on the shortening of the electoral period could be passed as 
early as Thursday [17 March]. 
  However, he said, there would have to be a "harmony of 
opinion," between the deputies' groups of the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the Slovak National Party (SNS), the 
Democratic Left Party (SDL) and other deputies. 
  The HZDS preferred a June date for elections, Gasparovic 
(HZDS) said on Slovak radio, because this was what citizens 
wanted, and this was shown among other things by the organizing 
of the petition drive. 
  Gasparovic said that today's report from the President's 
Office that the president would not be calling a referendum due 
to alleged inadequacies in the petition sheets was a "hard blow" 
for the citizen. However, he indicated that a certain "new 
step" would be decided on today still, but did not give further 
details. 
  SDL chairman Peter Weiss confirmed that his party was 
attempting to reach an election date by a constitutional law, 
but said he understood a referendum as "insurance," to make sure 
that elections were not forgotten about. He added that the SDL 
considered a September date as best. 
  The KDH would vote on Thursday for the shortening of the 
electoral term, and gave precedence to a date at the end of 
September and the beginning of October, KDH chairman Jan 
Carnogursky said. 
  The deputies' group of the Alternative of Political Realism 
(defectors from the HZDS) favor the same date, spokesman 
Vladimir Bajan said. It was unacceptable for the new Slovak 
government to function only for two months, Bajan said, and thus 
the group rejected a June date. 
  Deputies from the National Democratic deputies' group will 
vote for a September, or perhaps an October date, their chairman 
Ludovit Cernak said. Their belief was "the later the better," 
Cernak said, so that the political practices of ex-premier 
Vladimir Meciar could be fully unveiled and so that he would no 
longer be an "idol" by the election time. 
  Deputy Pal Csaky said that for the Hungarian minority 
Egyutteles- Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) 
coalition a September date was acceptable. Given that two camps 
were forming, of which one supported a June date and the other a 
September one, he did not think the law would be passed. Csaky 
said he considered the idea of making President Michal Kovac 
call a referendum by parliamentary decree to be unhappy, because 
if a referendum was called, and then both parliamentary and 
community elections were held, people would be fed up of voting 
this year.

  [Text] Kosice, east Slovakia, March 16 (CTK) -- The 
independent daily SLOVENSKY VYCHOD, citing "well informed 
sources," reports today that the former government of Prime 
Minister Vladimir Meciar sold 9.52 percent of the shares of a 
Kosice foundry shortly before it was dismissed last week. 
  The shares in the East Slovakia Foundries (VSZ), with a face 
value of 1.5 billion Slovak korunas ($45 million), were sold for 
300 million korunas ($9 million), of which 15 percent was in 
hard currency. 
  "Everything testifies to the fact that Vladimir Meciar's 
government continued right up to the end with its stunt-man 
style of privatization, creating the right conditions for (his) 
HZDS and for the return its people to the government, or rather 
to power in Slovakia," the daily writes. 
  This privatization project was carried out "behind the veil" 
of the new VSZ leadership and "its grey eminence," ex-Finance 
Minister Julius Toth, who came to the ministry directly from 
VSZ, where he was an independent specialist, the daily writes, 
pointing to Meciar's statement on Monday that Toth was the only 
HZDS founder who had been silenced. "Today we can only guess 
how many millions for Vladimir Meciar's election campaign in 
1992 came from the revenues of VSZ, when Julius Toth was 
`finance minister'," the daily writes. 
  According to the daily SME, this is the reason for the 
sudden 
calling of a VSZ general meeting for Thursday, March 17, to 
discuss the privatization project and the "establishment" of 
Toth at the head of the foundries' supervisory council. 
  A written statement from the VSZ management said only that 
the meeting was called at the request of the National Property 
Fund, which, as holder of more than 10 percent of the company's 
shares, has the right to call for a general meeting. 
  "The purpose of the shareholders' meeting will be to change 
the status of the joint stock company and to change the 
membership of its supervisory council," the statement says.

  [Excerpts] Bratislava March 16 (CTK) -- While the 
composition of the government of new Slovak Premier Jozef 
Moravcik remains a mystery, the Slovak press speculates in 
today's issues. [passage omitted] 
  The pro-Meciar government daily REPUBLIKA launches another 
attack against the personality and past of Moravcik under the 
page one banner headline "Founder of the Spark of Lenin Club 
Heads Slovak Government." 
  Moravcik's decision to form a dissident faction within the 
HZDS [Movement For a Democratic Slovakia] and then to join 
forces with those who voted no confidence in Meciar shows that 
the new premier's "realism" lies in his ability to connive and 
predict the future, the daily writes. 
  The roots of Moravcik's stances which elevated him to the 
foreign ministry are embedded in the Spark of Lenin Club, "which 
began its activities -- wonder of the world -- not in the 1950's 
or the years of normalisation, but in 1988." Moravcik was "also 
prescient when he later joined forces with Meciar... but was 
hardened by the political discussions in the Spark of Lenin 
Club, put out his antennae in time, and behind the back of his 
movement (the HZDS) he held talks with President Kovac and 
opposition leaders about bringing down the government he 
belonged to." 
  "After the lighting of the Leninist spark, the `centering' 
of 
the VPN (Public Against Violence, the forerunner of HZDS) and 
the `realistic alternative,' Moravcik is getting, with the help 
of college educated Marxist-Leninists (this time in the 
Democratic Left Party [SDL]), the post he was already modestly 
longing for around the Leninist campfire," REPUBLIKA concludes. 
"His rise has its logic. According to the principle: Shake 
thoroughly before use, after use throw it out." 
  REPUBLIKA continues in the same vein with its attacks on 
Moravcik's still unnamed government, which it says does not have 
nor will have either ethical, moral or political legitimacy or 
authority. 
  The new government did not come to power through 
parliamentary elections, but through intrigues, and therefore 
will rush toward populism. Nor will it restrain itself from 
making promises or insulting the previous government, the daily 
writes. 
  "Similarities to (the communist takeover in) February 1948 
are certainly accidental," REPUBLIKA comments ironically. "Only 
the `technology' of the strategy and tactics was different then, 
and the individuals played different roles," it adds, pointing 
out that one of the main actors in today's drama was a member of 
the Czechoslovak Communist Party operating in London, later as a 
financial advisor to Castro's Cuba, and now as president. 
  REPUBLIKA also claims that it was 230 billion crowns worth 
of 
national property to be privatised that led SDL Chairman Peter 
Weiss, who "hides badly his longing for the renewal of communist 
power," and KDH [Christian Democratic Movement] Chairman Jan 
Carnogursky, who "voted against the Slovak Constitution, 
sovereignty and statehood," to join forces. 
  "When money is concerned, brother doesn't know brother. 
Vladimir Meciar broke with 'morality' because he did not want 
anything for himself. As they said during the French 
Revolution: One can't be clean among the unclean." [passage 
omitted]

of the anniversary of the 1848 war of independence -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Citizens of Szeged, my dear friends: The date 
of 15 March is the festival of spring, our country's spring. 
[passage omitted] 
  Today we are in a different situation than that of Petoefi 
[poet-hero of the 1848 revolution] and his revolutionary 
friends. Today we live in an independent country and nobody is 
forcing our homeland to struggle for survival. No threatening 
great power looms over us to trample on our freedom with their 
jackboots. We have created our system of democratic 
institutions and it is only up to us to learn the unwritten 
rules of democracy. Today we are obligated not by force but by 
the Constitution of our country to realize what the number one 
point of the March youth [reference to the March Declaration of 
the revolutionaries in 1848] was demanding: freedom of the 
press, and its freedom from the shackles of either economic or 
political group interests. 
  Our Constitution states clearly that in Hungary everyone has 
the right to express his opinion freely and to obtain 
information and disseminate facts and figures of public 
interest. The Hungarian Republic recognizes and protects the 
freedom of the press; this is what the quotation from the 
Constitution says. 
  I am obliged by the Constitution to voice the unity of the 
nation and to guard the democratic operation of the state 
organization. [passage omitted] 
  We know that radio and television today are forced to 
operate 
under the supervision of the government until the laws 
considered by the Constitutional Court as necessary for their 
operation are adopted, thereby bringing about the supervision of 
these two institutions by society. Thus, today it is the 
government's duty to enforce the Constitutional Court's 
stipulations regarding radio and television. This is how it can 
provide real evidence that it respects the statutes of the 
Constitution. [applause] 
  To close this subject let me add that no matter how 
important 
-- right now in the middle of the election struggle -- the state 
of radio and television and the proper enforcement of the 
Constitution's stipulations, this is only a symptom. What 
really is important today, the real subject and stake of the 
election struggle, is the democratic operation of the whole 
country. This has to be evaluated freely by every citizen of 
this country, without any biased influence. This is their moral 
right and duty, and last but not least, their important 
self-interest. [passage omitted] 
  I know that you here in Szeged, and others elsewhere in the 
country, look about yourselves hesitantly. You read in the 
papers daily that billions disappear gradually as they are 
passed from hand to hand, that your children are approached by 
drug dealers, and that guns are sold alongside cheap T-shirts at 
the flea markets. 
  During this sunny spring people are groping in the slimy fog 
of suspicion and feel the tip of some sort of iceberg, but they 
do not know what kind of iceberg it is. They do not know what 
is under the surface, and they feel that our society is 
intertwined by alliances of criminal interest. The country is 
buzzing with hearsay and demands names -- and rightly so. Let 
us hope that our police will overcome this horrible situation. 
[passage omitted] 
  All this, of course, is also up to us. First, we have to 
find peace in ourselves. To do this, we must not believe the 
constant shower of slander that splatters mud on everything and 
everybody. We must not join the ranks of those following 
murderous ideas beckoning from the past, and we must guard our 
sanity with great care. We must not believe that the world is 
resolutely out to get us, and only us. 
  Let us accept that we Hungarians are all Hungarians, and 
that 
the Hungarian flag is beautiful as it is: red, white, and 
green. It is not worthwhile exchanging it with either the red 
flag of Stalin, the white flag of the aristocracy, or the green 
flag of the Arrow Cross party. [applause] 
  These colors are rather faded by now, and it is difficult to 
distinguish between them. Let us proclaim that to be Hungarian 
is no virtue, no prerogative, but not condemnation to exile 
either. It is a state originating from our language and our 
traditions. It is such a natural and everyday state that one 
does not even have to think about it. However, most of us could 
not even imagine living somewhere else and some other way. 
[passage omitted] 
  I wanted to say to you today, on the ides of March 1994, 146 
years after Petoefi and his young friends proclaimed freedom, 
equality, and fraternity in our country. Let us be honest: In 
this part of the world all three leave something to be desired 
even today. It is up to us to remedy this. Thank you for your 
attention.

  [Text] Regarding President Bill Clinton's announcement 
made in the U.S. Congress on 14 March on the extension of the 
moratorium on nuclear tests until September 1995, Mircea Geoana, 
spokesman of the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, today 
declared the following: 
  Romania salutes the decision that encourages the achievement 
of the goals of nonproliferation -- above all, the unconditioned 
prolongation over an indefinite period of time of the treaty on 
the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons -- as well as the 
negotiations currently taking place at the Geneva disarmament 
conference on a total ban on nuclear tests. 
  We express our hope that in concordance with the efforts 
made 
by the international community to strengthen the current 
juridical instruments and institutions set up to prevent the 
spreading of mass destruction weapons, all other nuclear powers 
will take measures similar to those adopted by the U.S. party, 
the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.

<F P=106> [Interview with EVENIMENTUL ZILEI Director Ion Cristoiu by </F>
Laurentiu Badicioiu; place and date not given: "Cotroceni's New 
Stupidity"] 
  [Text] [Badicioiu] Ion Cristoiu, the daily EVENIMENTUL 
ZILEI is under criminal investigation for violating the law on 
state security. How do you view this new conflict between the 
president and your newspaper? 
  [Cristoiu] Even if the decision belongs to the General 
Prosecuting Magistracy, I believe this is a new stupidity of the 
Cotroceni [Romanian Presidency], namely using this pretext to 
start a new campaign against the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI. Let us not 
forget that there are most tense relations between our newspaper 
and the president. We have been under criminal investigation 
for quite some time following a personal request of the 
president and we were penalized, meaning that our journalists 
can no longer attend news conferences held at Cotroceni Palace, 
as if it were President Iliescu's personal property. Maybe this 
is a new pretext used to start a campaign against our newspaper. 
If a newspaper such as EVENIMENTUL ZILEI can intercept a 
telephone call from Cotroceni Palace, this means that any dumb 
spy can listen to what is being discussed at Cotroceni and find 
out even more about the head of the state! President Iliescu is 
taking his revenge on the person who drew his attention to this 
fact. This act of ours also has the purpose to drawing the 
attention of the public to the chaos currently prevailing in 
Romania. 
  [Badicioiu] Mr. Cristoiu, it has been indicated that there 
is a person at Cotroceni Palace who supplies information to the 
EVENIMENTUL ZILEI and, now, there are attempts to eliminate this 
person... 
  [Cristoiu] There is no such a person. Nobody is supplying 
us any secret information because, as a matter of fact, such a 
person would be useless, considering that the decisions taken by 
President Iliescu are taken by him alone, so we should have a 
person hiding inside the president's head, a sort of small 
devil, who could tell us what goes on in the president's head. 
We get our information through our specific means. Mrs. 
Nicolaescu, who was answering the phone, had a behavior that is 
unqualifiable for a person who is the chief of the cabinet of 
the head of state, meaning that she allows herself to make 
idiotic comments. Thus, instead her being removed from office, 
this criminal investigation was started against us! 
  [Badicioiu] How do you view this formulation in the law on 
state security? 
  [Cristoiu] Only now, we are beginning to realize that when 
the law is implemented, there are all kind of loopholes in it 
that allow evasion of the law. The same holds true for this law 
on state security. We are accused of disseminating information 
of a secret nature. I believe that this is the most aberrant 
affirmation possible, because when a newspaper can disseminate 
information of a secret nature, it means that the respective 
information has not been protected. Therefore, the first 
measure to be taken would be to protect such information. 
Instead of those who fail to protect such information being 
punished, those who publish them are attacked. Certainly, I 
agree that a high Army official should be punished if he 
supplies secret information to somebody. However, if the press 
got hold of this piece of information, I fail to see why it has 
to be punished rather than those who were entrusted to keep the 
respective information secret! 
  [Badicioiu] Do you believe that the messages published in 
your paper damaged the image of the president? 
  [Cristoiu] No, I do not think so. I believe that things are 
much simpler than that. Considering that I am aware of the 
state of affairs at Cotroceni, I understand how things work 
there. For the president, that was the greatest eulogy on his 
birthday because we were the only paper that published something 
positive. None of the pro-presidential newspapers bothered to 
report on the president's birthday. I believe that if I had 
worked with the DIMINEATA [presidential paper] I would have been 
given an award because I, using my own means, published a whole 
page -- just imagine! -- full of positive messages. I believe 
that Mrs. Nicolaescu made a big fuss and, just like Desdemona, 
complained to the president, and he, being a sensitive person 
when it comes to female company around him, got very angry. 
Probably, if we had not reported what the lady was chattering 
about, nothing would have happened. I believe that, from the 
president's viewpoint, it was some of the most successful 
reading for Ion Iliescu. Now, President Iliescu has to prove 
that he has a feeling for drama because, when a newspaper in 
Romania can intercept what is being discussed at Cotroceni, it 
means that the system of national defense is in the worst 
possible shape. Considering that humor often mixes with the 
tragic side of things, the president should close the entire 
affair and start taking internal protection measures. In any 
event, we have done an immense service to the president, because 
we drew his attention to the fact that, in spite of all the 
money that the electorate gives him to ensure his protection, 
talks in the Cotroceni Palace can be intercepted any time by 
anybody who wishes to do so.

<F P=106> [Marcela Feraru report: "Daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI has </F>
Submitted a Complaint to the Council of Europe About President 
Ion Iliescu Violating the Human Rights Convention"] 
  [Text] One year ago, that is, on 13 May 1993, Romanian 
President Ion Iliescu suspended the accreditation of the 
EVENIMENTUL ZILEI daily to Cotroceni Palace [Romanian 
Presidency]. Our journalists were banned from participating in 
news conferences given by the president and their access to the 
presidential palace or close to the president's circle at 
various events or visits throughout the country or abroad was 
banned, because they are guilty of publishing a figure that 
represented the salary that President Iliescu was about to 
receive after a vote in the parliament. 
  The requests of the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI to have the 
accreditation returned remained without response. Currently, 
our daily continues to be submitted to presidential sanctions. 
In these conditions, in which the domestic means of attack have 
been exhausted, the only solution to settle this situation, 
which involves the violation of a fundamental principle of the 
European Convention on Human Rights -- the free access to 
information -- remains to bring it to the attention of the 
Council of Europe [CE]. We wish to note that we are not talking 
about the rights of our paper, but the rights of our readers -- 
those people who are paying their taxes to the state and thus 
participate in supporting the expenses of the presidency -- to 
be informed about President Ion Iliescu's activity. 
  As a matter of fact, the situation is already known by the 
Strasbourg Forum. The documents of the rapporteurs on Romania, 
completed on the occasion of the procedure of admitting our 
country to the Council of Europe, also mentions that the 
accreditation of certain papers that criticize the leadership 
has been suspended and it is suggested that this problem should 
be solved immediately. The same issue can also be found in 
Document 6953, which was distributed to European 
parliamentarians at the 1994 January session, a document that 
was initiated by Daniel Tarschys, president of the Liberal 
political group. 
  We must note that, for the time being, the citizens of 
Romania do not have the possibility to turn to the European 
Court of Human Rights because -- in contradiction to the latest 
affirmations of Florin Radulescu Botica, Social Democracy Party 
of Romania [PDSR] senator -- the European Convention on Human 
Rights has not been submitted to the parliament for 
ratification. We are quoting a passage from Notification Number 
176 in connection with Romania's request to be admitted to the 
Council of Europe: "The Assembly attaches great importance to 
the promises made by the Romanian authorities to sign and ratify 
expeditiously the European Convention on Human Rights (Article 
25 of the Convention) as well as the compulsory jurisdiction of 
the European Court for Human Rights (Article 46 of the 
Convention)." 
  In these conditions, our daily has decided to draw the 
attention of the presidents of the two commissions that, on the 
basis of the Halonen directive, are supervising the 
implementation of the commitments assumed by Romania when it was 
accepted to the Council of Europe: 
  Esteemed Mr. President: 
  Through you and through the commission that you head, we 
turn 
to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to ask 
you to intercede with the Council of Europe through the 
procedural means available to you, in order to put an end to the 
violation of one of the fundamental standards of European 
democracy, namely the freedom of the press and the right to have 
free access to information. 
  We are referring to the act of banning the journalists of 
our 
publication, that is, the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI daily, from being 
present at news conferences organized by Romania's president, as 
well as banning them from all sources of information connected 
with the activity of the presidential institution. This measure 
was taken precisely as a punishment for articles and critical 
news items that were published in our newspaper about the policy 
promoted by the president or the government. 
  We would like to mention that the newspaper EVENIMENTUL 
ZILEI 
is the most popular daily in Romania and has three daily issues, 
and that it is obvious that, precisely for this reason, out of 
all the independent papers published in Romania, EVENIMENTUL 
ZILEI is the most severely sanctioned, thus the most important 
source in the written press is being obstructed. 
  This illegal punitive measure was adopted on 13 May 1993 and 
it has not been lifted, either after our repeated requests or 
upon the public's request; it has not been lifted upon the 
recommendation of the Council of Europe either, which was 
included clearly in the reports of Messrs. Friedrik Koenig and 
Gunnar Jansson [Council of Europe rapporteurs]. 
  Apart from the material and moral loss suffered by our 
newspaper as a result of the lack of possibility to relate 
various information from its own sources regarding the 
presidential institution, the greatest damage is suffered by the 
Romanian public itself, which is missing the possibility of 
having complete and unhampered access to information. 
  We would like to add to the above that it was the same 
presidential institution that, meantime, brought a series of 
criminal charges against us for the most-aberrant crimes 
imagineable. The fact that the respective trials had the purpose 
of intimidating us and hampering us in our action to freely 
exercise our profession is also proved by the fact that every 
time the procedures began, the president withdrew the charges 
and abandoned the act as unexpectedly as he had started it. 
  In accordance with the normal procedures, we would have 
liked 
to turn to the European Court of Human Rights with our problem, 
however, unfortunately, we still do not have this possibility 
because Romania, in spite of its pledges, has not, to this very 
day, ratified the European Convention on Human Rights. We 
reserve the right that after the ratification of the respective 
Convention, we can turn to the Court of Justice in Strasbourg. 
However, considering that the act of finding solutions to this 
problem can no longer be delayed, we are turning to you for 
support. 
  Within this context we also express our dissatisfaction with 
the unjustified slow pace with which the current leadership is 
going through the procedural moves of ratifying the European 
Convention on Human Rights. 
  We thank you for the attention you pay to our problem and we 
express our hope that the actions that you are going to take 
will be effective and will be in favor of democracy.

  [Text] According to reports sent in by our correspondents, 
manifestations pegged to the 146th anniversary of the 1848 
Hungarian revolution took place in various localities today. 
Major Gabor Nagy, deputy military attache at the Hungarian 
Embassy in Bucharest, and (Jozsef Gotz), vice president of the 
Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania [UDMR] in charge of 
cultural and religious affairs, participated in a religious 
service held at the Reformed Church of Sighetul Marmatiei. 
Wreaths were laid today at commemorative plaques in Cluj-Napoca 
in honor of two of the prominent figures of the revolutionary 
events of 1848, Sandor Petofi and Nicolae Balcescu. Andras 
Kelemen, secretary of the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
a delegation from the Hungarian Embassy in Bucharest, and 
several UDMR leaders participated in a festive meeting and a 
gala show at the Targu Mures Palace of Culture tonight. 
  A religious celebration and wreath-laying ceremony took 
place 
at the Monument of the Martyr Szecklers in Targu Mures this 
afternoon. The wreaths carried the emblem of the Hungarian 
state as well as sashes with the colors of the Hungarian 
national flag. 
  Gyorgy Tokay, UDMR deputy from Arad, addressed a ceremony 
held at the Monument of the 13 Generals at the Arad Citadel. He 
emphasized the worldwide historical significance of the freedom 
won by the Hungarians in the wake of the 1848 revolution. 
Wreaths were laid on behalf of UDMR-Arad branch, the Hungarian 
Embassy to Bucharest, the Town Hall of Arad Municipality, the 
Democratic Organization of Bulgarians from Arad, the German 
Forum, and various Hungarian journalistic, cultural, and youth 
organizations from Arad. 
  The series of UDMR actions pegged to the 1848-1849 
revolution 
concluded in Covasna County this afternoon. Wreaths were laid 
at the monument in the center of Sfantu Gheorghe Municipality, 
after which a commemorative show took place at the Little 
Stadium. In this connection, Mr. Adrian Vlad Casunean, prefect 
of Covasna County, told the press that in his opinion today's 
actions are anomalies of a revanchist nature. Both in Targu 
Secuiesc and Baraolt the demonstrators carried the Hungarian 
flag; in Baraolt, the Romanian flag was covered with a black 
ribbon in several instances. The Covasna prefect said that he 
will ask the town halls and the police to take legal steps 
against the UDMR organizers and he also emphasized that Law 
60/1991 on organizing and holding public meetings should be 
amended in order to avoid the repeat of such antinational 
actions in the future.

<F P=106> [Irina Dimiu article: "In Spite of Parliamentary Support, </F>
There Are Huge Differences of Doctrine and Policy Between the 
PSM and PDSR"] 
  [Text] At the conference of the Bucharest Municipality 
organization of the PSM [Socialist Party of Labor], party 
President Ilie Verdet said: "We do not recognize that there was 
a revolution in Romania. Had there been a revolution, then we 
would like to know who the leaders of the revolution were. As 
far as the changes that happened then are concerned, we think 
that it was necessary to eliminate Nicolae Ceausescu and his 
totalitarian regime." 
  Expressing his belief that the reform has failed because it 
was not managed in a qualified and competent way, the PSM 
president said that: "those who were in power and promoted the 
reform should not be judged because they enjoyed 66 percent of 
the votes of the electorate." The Social-Democrats -- who have 
been ruling so far -- have not understood that they have to 
change the basic concept of this reform. Social-democracy was 
discredited in Romania for a long time because of Roman (Petre, 
former prime minister and president of the Democratic Party) and 
Cunescu (Sergiu, president of the Social Democratic Party of 
Romania). 
  We voted in favor of the IMF memorandum, Verdet said, 
although it is onerous and unjust toward our country, but we 
could not possibly vote with the right wing. However, we have 
achieved a compromise, namely, that the respective memorandum 
should not be approved by law, so the parliament is now free to 
reject it and ask for it to be renegotiated. 
  "We told the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] 
members 
that they should solve the case of [former Defense Minister] 
Spiroiu and Pancea [accused of spying for the French secret 
services], because they need to show some moral character at 
least at the top, because Mitrea [Fratia Free TU Confederation 
vice president] and Ciorbea [Fratia Free TU Confederation 
president] understand only the language of money." 
  As far as foreign policy is concerned, the PDM president 
said: "We have no business in a war together with the United 
States against Iraq. Even if Saddam is a dictator and the Iraqi 
people support him, that is their business. What was our 
justification to side with the United States and Israel in the 
blockade against Cuba? What are we doing in a war side by side 
with the United States in Somalia?"

  [Text] A group of parliament members from the National 
Unity Party of Romania [PUNR] held a news conference in the 
Green Hall of the Senate today within the framework of which 
Adrian Motiu, vice president of the Senate Foreign Policy 
Commission, presented a few of his conclusions regarding the 
visit he recently paid to Washington. 
  Referring to the way Romania is known in Washington, the 
PUNR 
senator assessed that this knowledge is simplistic and distorted 
due to the lack of information for which the diplomatic mission 
representing us there is to be blamed as well. 
  Mr. Adrian Motiu specified that during his meetings at the 
State Department and U.S. Congress, he explained that the PUNR 
is far from the description of extremism and that the verbal 
attacks of certain leaders have nothing to do with the way of 
action and thinking of PUNR. 
  Referring to the Hungarian celebration linked to 13-15 
March, 
PUNR believes that they must take place within a legal 
framework, without harming the national dignity of Romanians, 
our correspondent Ana Ionescu informed us.

  [Text] Immediately after the swearing-in ceremony of the 
new Slovak Government, Slovak President Michal Kovac addressed 
the members of the new government. 
  [Correspondent Anna Samelova] President Michal Kovac has 
just 
finished his address to the new Slovak Government. I shall 
acquaint you with the most important ideas in his speech. 
  At the beginning, President Michal Kovac said that, even if 
governmental changes were a natural part of the political life 
of democratic countries, the Slovak Republic was still too young 
a state not to experience every such change with particular 
sensitivity and tension. 
  He told the new Cabinet ministers that, apart from 
fulfilling 
the duties deriving from their offices, they would have to calm 
a population that had been made to feel insecure, and they would 
have to conciliate the incomprehensible and dangerous hostility 
among various groups of citizens. 
  He went on to say--I quote: You have entered the government 
I am inaugurating today on the basis of the agreement made among 
a number of political groups. You represent a very broad 
spectrum of views. Within the extremes of this spectrum, there 
is something that you all can and must share--protecting the 
interests of the young Slovak state and the substantial majority 
of its population. You must make the Slovak Republic a 
recognized part and a reliable partner of democratic Europe as 
soon as possible. You must enable the citizens to provide a 
comfortable life as soon as possible, without worrying about the 
bare necessities of life. 
  In the next part of his speech, President Kovac asked the 
members of the government not to think of their inauguration as 
starting from zero. Rather, they should preserve the continuity 
of the government and the state and become the guarantee of this 
continuity. They should become a government that does not want 
to abolish but, rather, create, one that wants to continue 
everything worthwhile done by the previous government. 
  In this connection, Kovac went on to say that the Slovak 
parliament disagreed with the autocratic style of the prime 
minister and some members of the previous government, refuted 
the significant trend toward the concentration of power, and 
made a stand for the protection of democracy and morality in 
political life. This, however, does not mean, President Kovac 
said, that the good results of the previous government and its 
prime minister and everything useful that they did for the 
Slovak citizens should be discredited. 
  The president then thanked Vladimir Meciar and his 
government 
for every positive step of his Cabinet and praised, in 
particular, the merits of Vladimir Meciar for the creation of 
the Slovak Republic's state sovereignty. 
  He also said it was a good sign that the political 
representatives of our Hungarian fellow citizens had also 
expressed support for the new government and, in this way, had 
declared their loyalty to the Slovak Republic. This makes it 
possible to implement a political line that would enable all 
groups among the citizens of Slovakia to see the new government 
as their own. 
  The circumstances in which this government has been formed 
and the current political reality, President Kovac went on to 
say, establishes as one of the government's most important tasks 
the securing of a dignified and calm run-up to the elections in 
such a way as to remove any possible doubts about democracy in 
the Slovak Republic. 
  President Michal Kovac then described three conditions for 
creating a favorable--i.e., peaceful--atmosphere in our society. 
One of them is the cooperation of all constitutional 
institutions--the president, the government, and the parliament. 
The second is proper relations between the government and the 
opposition and their mutual respect. The third is the 
cooperation of the government with the state administration on 
lower levels, without insensitive and directive interference 
from above. 
  Of equal importance are proper relations with the 
institutions of local self-administration. 
  According to Kovac, the first condition for creating a 
positive image about Slovakia at home and abroad, as an 
attractive state with good prospects, is to put public life at 
home in order. 
  The president said he believed that the new government would 
recognize its great opportunity to send an important and 
long-awaited signal abroad that Slovakia was a consolidated and 
stable country, that its democratic character could create a 
good foundation for all-round, useful cooperation with every 
serious political or commercial partner. 
  The president said at the end--I quote: The citizens of the 
Slovak Republic deserve a good government that gives preference 
to their interests over the interests of influential egoists. 
They deserve a government that caters for a peaceful life for 
all citizens without any preference, whichever political camp 
they belong to or even if they belong to no political camp. You 
have the opportunity and also the duty to become such a 
government. With this trust, I have given you today the letters 
of appointment as members of the Slovak Government, and, with 
this trust, I wish you professional and personal happiness, that 
citizens understand all of your decisions, and that, in the 
shortest time possible, the population name you the government 
of successful cooperation. With these words President Michal 
Kovac ended his speech.

  [Text] Our team has just returned from a news conference 
held after the first meeting of the government. Here is the 
first news from the meeting held today. 
  [Begin recording] [Prime Minister Josef Moravcik] The 
government, which had taken the oath, met for its first regular 
meeting tonight. The agenda included organizational issues. We 
clarified the nature and the style of our work and cooperation, 
as well as the schedule of our meetings. Besides these general 
matters, the government deemed it necessary to make one 
personnel change. It has recalled the president of the police 
corps as of today and appointed Mr. Lastovka to this post, as of 
today. The government considered this inevitable in order to 
ensure that the police corps operate with full efficiency. 
  Apart from that, the government has adopted a statement that 
will be read now by Mr. Simko. 
  [Simko] Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present to you the 
statement of the Slovak Government. 
  The government of the broad coalition is a government formed 
by several political parties, by people with different political 
opinions. It emerged due to the need to overcome the 
authoritarian way of ruling and to create conditions for 
respect, tolerance, and cooperation among citizens. 
  The government is resolved to do everything in its power for 
the good of the Slovak Republic. The government honors and 
respects the principles of a law-governed state and will act in 
line with them. The government will focus on a realistic 
transformation policy that will create conditions for economic 
stability. 
  The citizens' conditions of life and certainties will become 
the government's priority. The government identifies itself 
with the appeal made by President Michal Kovac for civic, 
political, and national reconciliation. In this spirit, the 
government intends to take part in creating conditions for the 
citizens of the Slovak Republic to freely express their will in 
early elections. 
  [Moravcik] The selection of state secretaries will be 
carried 
out in a similar way to the formation of the government--that 
is, it will be the subject of coalition talks, and a similar key 
will be used. Individual ministers should have their say in the 
matter. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In the next few minutes, you 
are going to hear interviews that correspondents Anna Samelova 
and Ivan Samel have conducted with the newly appointed ministers 
of key ministries. First of all, however, here is President 
Michal Kovac's answer to the question of what he expects from 
the new government. 
  [Begin Kovac recording] The fact that this government was 
formed five days after a vote of no-confidence in the previous 
government was passed shows that Slovakia has capable 
politicians who have the will to cooperate in the interest of 
the state and in the national interests of the Slovak Republic. 
I expect that, during its term of office, this government will 
confirm and consolidate this and will also give citizens 
confidence that we are not such a wrangling nation as it might 
have seemed recently. 
  Second, it is necessary that this government prepare the 
ground to ensure a calm course for the new elections that will 
most probably take place this fall. The government has very 
important tasks in the areas of the economy and social and 
foreign policy. In the economic and social areas, especially, it 
has to take measures to stop a further decline in the economy 
and the rise in unemployment. Measures need to be taken as well 
to increase the feeling of security among citizens who worry 
about their health and property, and about their social 
prospects. There are other tasks, as well, but the most 
important ones are those I have just mentioned here. [end

  [Excerpt] Bratislava--[passage omitted] 
<H5>  About the Referendum </H5>
  The institution of the referendum exists precisely to make 
it 
possible to change even the constitutional system. The French 
Constitution did not make it possible for de Gaulle to be 
elected directly by the citizens, and he thus proposed, acting 
in contravention of the Constitution, that he be granted this 
right in a referendum. Otherwise, he would step down. He was 
accorded this right in a referendum and this [the direct 
election of the French president] is still valid. This means 
that a referendum can go beyond the constitutional framework and 
that even questions can be asked in it that are not quite in 
conformity with the Constitution. This is the case because a 
referendum is the most democratic form of expression. The 
conclusions of an all-popular vote are generally valid and 
respected everywhere, and, because this referendum [initiated by 
the HZDS] is the first ever in this state, it deserves support 
and not to make voters disgusted.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Popely, chairman of the Hungarian </F>
People's Party, by Gabor Paizs; place and date not given: "Gyula 
Popely About the Fall of the Meciar Cabinet"] 
  [Text] [Paizs] As chairman of the Hungarian People's 
Party outside the Slovak parliament, what is your opinion about 
the success of the second no-confidence motion and the fall of 
the Meciar government? Can one envisage an advance of the left 
wing as in Poland? 
  [Popely] The domestic political situation in Slovakia has 
its particularity in the sense that the left essentially 
advanced in the months following the 1992 elections. A slowdown 
in the privatization process and, subsequently, a complete halt 
to this process are clear examples of this advance. It is hard 
to expect anything good or any clear development from the 
current situation. In my modest view, the situation will become 
even more complicated, and I do not exclude the possibility of a 
new and spectacular return of the current fallen prime minister, 
Meciar. And one should not forget that we are again facing 
elections. The only question is when these elections will be 
held. I think it would have been more fortunate if the Meciar 
Cabinet had continued for a few more months because, in that 
case, the entire society would have realized the true aspect of 
the country- and self-damaging Meciar policy. This way, 
however, Meciar has succeeded in creating a political situation 
in which, by escaping from it, he can live through the events of 
the coming months as a martyr. 
  [Paizs] A situation has emerged now that the ethnic 
Hungarian political parties represent the political balance. In 
your view, will the political prestige of the Hungarian parties 
indeed increase in the chess game of the coming days and weeks? 
  [Popely] That is true: The Hungarian parties represent the 
political balance today, but let me add that there is not a 
single opposition political force in Slovakia today that would 
be ready to regard the Hungarian parties as a serious factor. I 
think it is an illusion to expect a situation in which the 
Hungarians here can bring themselves into a serious political 
position with the formation of a new government, not because the 
Hungarians would refrain from participating but because every 
opposition Slovak party would lose popularity in the eyes of the 
Slovak voters if they cooperated with us. 
  [Paizs] Is it possible that the Hungarian parties will 
obtain more than 10 percent of the votes in the next elections? 
  [Popely] It is possible, but I do not regard this as a 
realistic figure. If the current electoral law remains in 
force, one that requires a threshold of 7 percent in the case of 
a coalition made up of two or three parties and a threshold of 
10 percent in the case of a coalition made up of four, I think 
the chances for Hungarian political subjects to enter the Slovak 
parliament are endangered. Therefore, the best thing would be 
for all of the Hungarian political forces to run under one name, 
not in a coalition but as a single party, with the participation 
of all of the Hungarian candidates, either on the list of 
Coexistence or on the list of the Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement. In that case, they would have to achieve only a 
5-percent threshold. One should not forget that, at the 
elections in June 1992, our success in reaching the 7-percent 
threshold depended on only 13,000 votes. 
  [Paizs] What is your opinion about the spread of the left 
and the relations of the Hungarian political parties with the 
left? Is it possible that Peter Weiss of the Party of the 
Democratic Left will also have a mandate from the Csallokoz area? 
  [Popely] This is quite possible, and even more than one 
mandate. One should not forget that there are two Hungarian 
parliamentary deputies in the Party of the Democratic Left. 
This party is expected to form an alliance with the Social 
Democrats and the Slovak Agricultural Party. The latter has a 
lot of people in the areas inhabited by Hungarians. It is to be 
feared that some of the former Hungarian members of agricultural 
cooperatives will not be steadfast enough, and they might vote 
for Weiss and his party under the spell of the promises of 
various social reforms. They deliberately "travel" around for 
Hungarian votes. It is no accident that one of the deputy 
chairmen of the Party of the Democratic Left is a Hungarian 
named Erzsebet Borza. This is the only Slovak party that has 
its own national minority concept.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Chief Editor Jan Smolec in the "Public Matter" </F>
column] 
  [Text] After the conclusion of yesterday's meeting of the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic [where a no-confidence 
vote in Meciar's government was passed], our editorial office 
was flooded with desperate telephone calls. Often through 
tears, the question could be heard: "WHAT IS GOING TO BECOME OF 
US SLOVAKS?" 
  People's fears are justified. Power has been seized by 
politicians who did not even move a finger for the independent 
Slovak Republic. 
  Vladimir Meciar, the architect of Slovak independence and 
for 
three years the most popular politician in Slovakia, has had to 
vacate the prime minister's seat under the influence of a 
Czechoslovakist, communist, and Hungarian conspiracy. 
  Who deserves the greatest credit for this political reversal 
on Slovakia's political scene? 
  First and foremost, the Slovak president and representatives 
of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] and the Christian 
Democratic Movement [KDH]. Henceforth, the life of the Slovak 
society will be influenced, for example, by Peter Weiss, an heir 
of the communists from whom we have not heard one word of a 
sincere declaration of affection for the Slovak nation. Jan 
Carnogursky, who had voted against Slovak sovereignty, may 
return to the Slovak Government. While the Slovak Metropolitan 
Archbishop Jan Sokol was praying for sovereignty, this Christian 
politician voted against it. Apparently from shame, the 
archbishop hid his face in the palms of his hands. 
  These people, together with the hate-filled [Alliance of 
Democrats Chairman Milan] Knazko and, of course, with exemplary 
irredentists, will lead Slovakia from now on. Where do you 
think they will lead it? They may want to steer the ship back 
to Czechoslovakist or other dangerous waters. Fortunately, 
there exist politicians, writers, members of the intelligentsia, 
journalists, and, most important of all, Slovaks who will 
carefully monitor their actions. For the time being, there also 
still exists the editorial staff of REPUBLIKA. The present 
victors will surely try to liquidate our newspaper and break up 
the editorial team. 
  They broke us up once before, but we came back. 
  We will not surrender. 
  The fight for Slovakia continues.

  [Text] Listeners as well as Radio Free Europe [RFE] editors 
themselves were really surprised this morning to find that the 
RFE broadcasts to Slovakia had gone silent. It was only after 
some time that they found out that the program was not being 
broadcast because the transmitters in Velke Kostolany and Poprad 
had been switched off. 
  Slovak Telecommunications issued a statement explaining the 
reason for the cutoff. Vladimir Ondrovic, director general of 
Slovak Telecommunications, gave more details at a news 
conference this afternoon. 
  [Begin Ondrovic recording] I was invited this Monday, 14 
March, to the Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Public 
Works, where I was presented with a document that said that 
Slovak Telecommunications was suspending transmission of RFE 
broadcasts via transmitters in Velke Kostolany and Poprad. The 
document was entitled "Cessation of a Contract or Cancellation 
of a Contract." This cannot be a cancellation of an agreement 
because there is one more transmitter, the one in Presov 
transmitting at 14 kilowatts. This transmitter is continuing 
transmissions and has not been switched off. 
  [Vladimir] Zeman, director of [the ministry's 
communications] 
section, asked me to sign this document and send it to RFE. He 
did so verbally, I received no written instruction. Director 
Kuban, who is in charge of all transmitters, be they for radio, 
TV, or RFE transmissions, was also present. I have to admit 
that both of us signed the document at that very moment. Mr. 
Zeman then told me that he would consult Minister Hofbauer on 14 
March over the matter and that the document would then be 
presented to the government, where he would want to have it 
approved. 
  On Monday afternoon at about 1400 GMT, Mr. Zeman came with 
other documents or, rather, with the same documents, which had 
not been signed but had been printed anew. He wanted us to sign 
these documents. I personally told him that I would not sign 
this document and that I would not send the fax to RFE. And 
that was what happened. 
  I called the executive [of Slovak Telecommunications] at 
1600 
GMT. The executive discussed the matter, and we decided that 
this would harm Slovakia and that we would not issue an order to 
switch off RFE. 
  Yesterday--that is, on 15 March--I was summoned to the 
Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Public Works. 
Director Kuban was summoned as well. I was showed a document 
on recalling the director of Slovak Telecommunications from his 
post. [as heard] Exactly at the same time, Kuban, who is the 
director of a branch of the telecommunications directorate, was 
shown a letter of appointment authorizing him to direct Slovak 
Telecommunications. After having received this document, Mr. 
Kuban began to take steps, and, without any instruction to do 
so, of his own will, he had the transmission of RFE broadcasts 
switched off last night. 
  I recalled Mr. Kuban from his post as director of a branch 
of 
the telecommunications directorate at 0720 GMT this morning in 
this very room. Subsequently, I issued an instruction to switch 
the transmission of RFE broadcasts on again.

  [Text] Anna Samelova, editor of Slovak radio's Radiozurnal, 
has strongly protested against the statement made by Peter 
Kuchar, spokesman of the Interior Ministry of the Slovak 
Republic, to the effect that some journalists used the events at 
the Primatial Square on Monday, 14 March, to compromise the 
police. 
  On that day at the Primatial Square, an unknown man hit 
Samelova in the face with his fist. She asked a policeman 
standing next to her for help. To her request, he replied: I 
am not here. 
  The Radiozurnal editor denies that, at the beginning of the 
Monday evening edition of Radiozurnal, she used the information 
to politically compromise the police. She merely described what 
happened at the square during a public radio broadcast. 
However, she does not see the fact that she decided not to 
press charges as a reason not to investigate the events and draw 
appropriate conclusions on the part of competent bodies.

<F P=106> [Interview with Thai Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai </F>
Phanitchaphak by "pen" in Prague; date not given: "Thailand Is 
Interested in Direct Trade With the Czech Republic"] 
  [Text] "Although our mutual trade soared in recent years, 
I believe that the potential has not been exhausted," Thai 
Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said in an 
interview for HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. In Prague, the Thai official 
discussed trade relations with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, 
Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, and other representatives. 
  "In the course of the talks, I have introduced some other 
commodities, like consumer goods, fruit, and several farm 
products. I also spoke about projects that might be of interest 
to Czech businessmen, that we invest in the development of the 
infrastructure--the railroads or road construction, for 
instance. We need chemicals. It would be expedient to found 
joint Czech-Thai ventures for the production and distribution of 
numerous items. I am thinking particularly of glass 
manufacturing, but also engineering and car-manufacturing 
projects." 
  In the interview, the Thai deputy prime minister emphasized 
that he considers the conditions in the Czech Republic suitable 
for opening branch offices of Thai commercial banks that would 
not only support the financing of mutual trade, but also trade 
with third countries. "I used my sojourn for informative talks 
with the Komercni Banka. We also want to trade with the other 
countries of Central and East Europe, including CIS. We know 
that the Czech Republic has substantial experience on these 
markets, including banking experience. Thus, it could play the 
role of a mediator for Thailand. And, vice versa, Thailand has 
good contacts with the developing economies of Vietnam--for 
instance, Cambodia, Laos, and China. So, it could become a good 
basis for your activities on these markets. I also can imagine 
a free trade zone." 
  Before his departure for Warsaw, Suphachai Phanitchaphak was 
also supposed to meet President Havel, who, however, fell ill 
with influenza.

  [Text] Thailand has the opportunity to export agricultural 
products to the Czech Republic, said Deputy Prime Minister 
Suphachai Phanitchaphak while visiting the country, along with 
Hungary and Finland, between March 19-21 [as published] this 
year. 
  While in the republic, he met with Vaclav Klaus, the Czech 
Republic's prime minister, Ivan Kocarnik, Deputy Prime Minister 
and Finance Minister and Radomir Sabela, Deputy Minister of 
Industrial and Trade Ministry. 
  All parties agreed to a co-operative economic expansion in 
trade, investment and banking. 
  Thailand expressed desire to export rice, coffee, and 
tapioca 
to the Czech Republic. Direct buying and selling transactions 
are planned to be conducted through Thailand's Ex-Im Bank 
instead of sales through the third country. The two parties 
agreed to operate the free trade area of CEFTA [Central European 
Free Trade Association] and AFTA [Atlantic Free Trade Area] by 
concentrating on Indochina's and Eastern Europe's trade gates to 
help decrease export taxes on products bound for the Czech 
Republic. The private sectors of both countries will also map 
out additional co-operative efforts, he said. 
  In the investment sector, Thailand persuaded the republic to 
pursue their crystal and machinery industry in Thailand. 
Expertise and production technology from Czech Republic are 
needed in Thailand, said Suphachai.

<F P=106> [Article by M.W.: "Rationales and Emotions; Poland and </F>
Lithuania Intend To Initial a Treaty Friday"] 
  [Text] President of the Polish Republic Lech Walesa 
had a telephone conversation yesterday with Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas, the Belweder's Press Office reported. Both 
presidents confirmed their will to have the foreign ministers of 
both countries initial a treaty on neighborly relations. This 
signing ceremony is to take place on Friday [18 March], during a 
visit to Poland by Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas 
Gylys. 
  President Brazauskas invited Lech Walesa to pay an official 
visit to Lithuania, and the invitation was accepted. 
  Albinas Januska, Lithuanian deputy foreign minister, said in 
a statement to THE BALTIC OBSERVER, which is published in Riga, 
that a condemnation of Polish history in the treaty would be 
absolutely unacceptable to Poland, and that is why a compromise 
had to be worked out. In Januska's view, Poland is one of 
Lithuania's most important partners, as well as Lithuania's 
"door" to Europe. The treaty between the two countries will 
allow for a free-trade treaty to be signed. After the treaty 
with Poland is finalized, Lithuania will be able to concentrate 
its attention on negotiations with Belarus and Russia. 
  But a newly established Social Committee for the 
Lithuanian-Polish Treaty, which was set up in Vilnius, organized 
a picketing at the Foreign Affairs Ministry building there, 
during which the committee demanded that the treaty's contents 
be made public and that Polish occupation of the Vilnius area be 
condemned. The committee announced another picketing shortly 
thereafter in front of the Sejm building, which is at the same 
time the president's headquarters.

<F P=106> [Article by Jaroslaw Palyska: "A Long Way to Europe: Why </F>
They Don't Want Us in the European Union"] 
  [Text] Polish politicians keep setting hopeful deadlines 
by which, they believe, Poland should be accepted into the 
European Union. Western politicians are much more circumspect 
on the subject. 
  Recently, the European Commission's delegate to Prague, 
Gerard Sabathil, presented his views on the question of the 
admission of countries from our region of Europe into the 
Community: Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic should 
indeed join the European Union, but only after they have moved 
at least halfway toward the levels of economic development 
standard throughout its countries. 
  Mr. Sabathil must surely be aware of the unrealistic quality 
of his suggestion. In the West, GDP figures are at least dozens 
of times higher than in Poland. Our GDP amounts to 4.7 percent 
of Belgian GNP and 6.1 percent of the German GDP. These 
proportions could change even further to our detriment, 
considering that, since 1989, our GNP has already fallen by 
about 12 percent. 
  Gerhard Sabathil's words gave rise to a storm of protests. 
Wolfgang Roth, SPD deputy and vice president of the European 
Investment Bank, accused Sabathil of creating an atmosphere 
conducive to another war in Europe. In his opinion, West Europe 
must accept the necessity of making efforts to "propel" the 
weaker economies of East European countries in order to prevent 
a political disaster. "The European Union cannot become some 
kind of exclusive `Prosperity Club' for countries that have 
inherited Charlemagne's legacy," Roth insists. 
  The view that the speedy integration of East Europe into the 
European Union is a necessity remains an empty declaration. 
Reality paints a completely different picture. There are few 
honest intentions underlying the facade of fine words. 
  The European Commission has rolled out the heavy artillery 
of 
its protectionist policies, which have been hitting our exports 
with all their might. The West applies the weapons of 
antidumping prices and predetermined limited import quotas. 
Steel producers have fought the hardest campaign against goods 
exported by the East. It is true that the European Union has 
promised a gradual lowering of tariffs on these products, yet it 
did not hesitate to introduce antidumping prices against the 
Czechs, who, in the opinion of Brussels politicians, were 
selling their products at below-production costs. So where is 
the alleged free market that has been praised to high heaven by 
the same politicians from Brussels? 
  Not only steel is at issue. There is a large variety of 
goods on which import limits or customs tariffs are imposed: 
meat, soft fruit, grains, and so on. 
  The West's resistance is not restricted to erecting economic 
barriers against us. Within the European Union itself, there 
are politicians hostile to the idea of accepting us into the 
Community. The French are terrified that East Europeans could 
reinforce Germany's powerful position. The weaker countries, 
such as Spain and Portugal, are afraid that East Europe's 
accession to the Union will weaken their own importance in the 
group. 
  There is no need to go on at length about the disastrous 
effects of such policies. Our countries' share in the trading 
figures of West European markets is rapidly decreasing for all 
sectors of the economy. Only 1.3 percent of chemical products 
sold there come from East Europe; the corresponding figures are 
2.7 percent of steel and steel products, and 2.3 percent of 
agricultural products. 
  We on our part are determined to give as good as we get in 
our trading with the West, and so we also slap customs tariffs 
on imported products and set limits on the quotas on individual 
goods (such as, for instance, automobiles). 
  It is not the purpose of this article just to describe the 
consequences of the protectionist policy. However, it must be 
said that it is first and foremost the customer who loses by it 
because he has no opportunity to choose freely the product that 
it would suit him most to buy. When imports are restricted, 
prices rise above the levels they would otherwise have reached. 
It is the customer who pays the difference. Moreover, the 
imposition of customs tariffs is harmful also to companies 
themselves because the weaker producers manage to survive in the 
market precisely thanks to tariffs. If these were eliminated, 
they could move their capital to more cost-effective sectors of 
the economy. 
  There are many more consequences of the protectionist 
policy, 
and the harmful ones outnumber those that are beneficial. Apart 
from our low GDP, what other reasons influence the Brussels 
politicians' unwillingness to approve our accession to the 
European Union? 
  In 1990, the average length of the Polish working week was 
33.3 hours. In Germany, it was longer by six hours, while in 
Austria and Switzerland it was longer by eight hours. In 
addition to this, we must remember that, in the West, people 
work those longer hours with better machines and equipment. For 
the time being, at least, their managerial personnel are also 
superior to ours. Consequently, they achieve higher 
productivity figures. 
  Furthermore, the structure of our economy also leaves a lot 
to be desired. In the West, the industry sector produces 25-35 
percent of the GDP. In Poland, our industry turns out as much 
as 40.9 percent of the GDP. It is possible that this is the 
result of the strong predilection that our former rulers 
manifested for the fire-belching smokestacks of heavy industry. 
By contrast, they paid absolutely no attention to the services 
sector, which generates the highest proportion of the West's 
wealth. 
  Our agriculture is in a state of complete collapse. Even 
though we turn out plenty of agricultural products, this is done 
at tremendous expense. Our farms are fragmented in the extreme. 
As many as 53.4 percent farms work between 1 and 4.9 hectares 
of land, a situation that is practically unknown in the West. 
The rural sector employs 27.8 percent of our working population 
in Poland, while the corresponding percentages in all countries 
between the Odra and the Atlantic are expressed in single 
figures. As we can see, here in Poland a whole massive army of 
agricultural workers cultivates a large number of small fields. 
Given such excessive fragmentation, it becomes not 
cost-effective to buy machines and fertilizers or to strive for 
higher productivity. Even though farmers keep agricultural 
production going, they are forced to do so at such a high price 
that they have hardly any money left in the form of decent 
profit. 
  These are merely the basic reasons the European Union does 
not want us in its midst. As long as we fail to put our own 
economic house and backyard in order, we need not count on 
receiving from the West a positive assessment of the possibility 
of our admission. It will depend on nothing but our own work 
whether we catch up with the wealthier countries. And we had 
better believe that no one is going to help us with it. We are 
forced to rely on ourselves and ourselves alone.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcin Dominik Zdort: "Extra-Sejm Constitutional </F>
Drafts; With Whom Can President Prepare Basic Law?"] 
  [Text] After the Sejm's rejection on the first 
reading of his draft law on proceedings used in adopting a new 
Constitution, President Lech Walesa announced that the basic law 
will be prepared outside of parliament. There was talk about a 
need to set up a 100-person constituent assembly and also about 
the possibility of legal experts from the President's Office 
preparing a Constitution, assisted by presidential councils to 
be set up by Walesa or in cooperation with extraparliamentary 
parties. which are working on their own drafts. "The president 
will present the new Constitution directly to the nation, and 
the nation will adopt it in a referendum," Lech Walesa's 
associates announced. 
  All significant extraparliamentary parties and blocs have 
been trying to come up with their own ideas on what kind of 
constitution Poland should have. 
<H5>  According to the ZChN, the PC, the RdR, the PL, and the KK </H5>
  The most popular constitutional commission outside of the 
Sejm was established by a coalition comprising the 
Christian-National Union [ZChN], the Center Accord [PC], 
Movement for the Republic [RdR], and the Peasant Accord [PL]. 
The commission's proceedings are coordinated by Walerian 
Piotrowski, chairman of the National Assembly's Constitutional 
Commission of the previous term. During the previous term of 
parliament, he was a senator for the ZChN. The commission 
includes as its members leaders of all of the parties forming 
the alliance, among them Wieslaw Chrzanowski and Marek Jurek of 
the ZChN, Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Ludwik Dorn of the PC, Romuald 
Szeremietiew and Lech Jeczmyk of the RdR, and Gabriel Janowski 
and Henryk Bak of the PL. Recently, as the right-wing camp was 
joined by the Conservative Coalition [KK] (a group formed after 
a split within the Conservative Party), the commission began to 
also include KK leaders Kazimierz Michal Ujazdowski and Lech 
Mazewski. 
  Proceedings by Piotrowski's Constitutional Commission began 
on 17 January, and the basis for the commission's work was 
determined to be made up of two drafts: a Senate draft of 1991 
and the PC draft from 1992. Actually, both of these 
propositions suited the views of the PC leaders in the various 
periods of the party's activity. The Senate draft, whose main 
promoter and coauthor is Senator Alicja Grzeskowiak of the PC, 
who is also a member of the Senate club of Solidarity and of the 
current National Assembly's Constitutional Commission, proposes 
strong presidential power, whereas the PC's draft is more 
cautious when it comes to defining the powers of the head of 
state. Leaders of the parties that are working on the draft do 
not hide the fact that a "too strong presidential power may lead 
to authoritarian rule, similar to anarchy." 
  The PC-ZChN-RdR-PL coalition has made a suggestion, on 
Ludwik 
Dorn's initiative, to the parties in the parliament, that a 
constitutional "Roundtable" be formed. A constitutional draft 
would be adopted by a National Constitutional Council, which 
would include proportionate representations by parties that 
gained at least 1 percent of the vote in the recent 
parliamentary elections. A draft agreed upon by such a 
commission would then be adopted by the Sejm on a "gentlemen's 
agreement" basis, just like the "Roundtable" agreements of 1989. 
But the governing coalition rejects the idea. 

<H5>    According to Solidarity and Secretariat </H5>
  A Social Constitutional Commission under the patronage of 
the 
Independent Self-Governing Trade Union Solidarity has been 
working on a constitution from scratch. The commission was set 
up during a congress of center-right-wing parties that took 
place in Krakow on 5 December 1993. The idea to establish this 
commission was put forward by the Secretariat of 
Center-Right-Wing Parties, which, among others, includes 
Christian Democracy-Party of Labor (of Tomasz Jackowski), 
Movement of the Third Republic (of Jan Parys), and the Polish 
Association (of Andrzej Anusz). Noninvolvement in politics is 
the commission's basic rule of action. Even though after 
Solidarity assumed patronage over the commission the trade 
union's chief, Marian Krzaklewski, became the commission's 
honorary chairman, the commission primarily includes different 
kinds of experts, including legal ones. In fact, the commission 
is chaired by Andrzej Rosciszewski, dean of the Warsaw Bar 
Association. The commission's sessions also include 
participation by members of the Senate club of Solidarity, such 
as Piotr Lukasz Juliusz Andrzejewski, Zbigniew Romaszewski, and 
August Chelkowski. Senator Alicja Grzeskowiak has also declared 
her willingness to participate (she is already a member of two 
other constitutional commissions). Among others, Jan Olszewski, 
Krzysztof Piesiewicz, Kazimierz Barczyk, and Jozefina 
Hrynkiewicz debate as experts in four groups: human and civic 
rights and duties; general constitutional principles as well as 
the defense system and extraordinary emergencies; political, 
social, and economic system; and sources of law and justice 
system's institutions. The commission's groups often conduct 
tours financed by Solidarity; the most recent of those took 
place this past weekend in Rynia, in the Zegrzyn lagoon area. 
  The Secretariat's politicians are hopeful that the law on 
proceedings for preparing the Constitution will include a 
citizens' constitutional initiative. After the rejection of 
Lech Walesa's draft, a similar proposition was suggested by 
Jerzy Jaskiernia of the Democratic Left Alliance. According to 
him, a group of half a million citizens should enjoy the 
possibility of submitting their own constitutional draft. "Only 
Solidarity is capable of gathering half a million signatures," 
one of the Secretariat's politicians says. 
<H5>  According to UPR, the PChD, the PK, the SLCh, and the SND </H5>
  "The Accord of 11 November," which includes the Union for 
Real Politics [UPR] of Janusz Korwin-Mikke, the Party of 
Christian Democrats [PChD] of Pawel Laczkowski, the Conservative 
Party [PK] of Aleksander Hall, the Peasant-Christian Party 
[SLCh] of Jozef Slisz, and the National-Democratic Party [SND] 
of Jan Zamoyski, does not intend to set up a constitutional 
commission of their own, even though a team is already working 
that is supposed to present "constitutional theses" of the 
economic right wing by 1 May 1994. "Out of the existing drafts, 
we feel that the Senate draft fulfills our expectations the 
most," the coalition's leaders say, but they also emphasize that 
the draft is not perfect. 
<H5>  Who With Walesa? </H5>
  Lech Walesa counts the most on cooperation with Solidarity 
and its Constitutional Commission. The president, while himself 
being in a dispute with the government, is looking for an ally 
in his dispute with parliament (the trade union is also in a 
dispute with the government). Lech Falandysz, deputy chief of 
the President's Office, stressed several times that the 
presidential proposition of a citizens' constitutional 
initiative was a cordial gesture addressed precisely at 
Solidarity. The trade union's activists and the Secretariat's 
politicians do not rule out a tactical alliance with Walesa 
during the fight for the Constitution, but they want to remain 
very cautious when it comes to any kind of wider cooperation. 
Right-wing activists of the other two blocs outside of the Sejm 
do not see a chance for cooperation with the president, while 
almost everyone agrees that the completely extraparliamentary 
way of adopting the Constitution suggested by Lech Walesa is 
unacceptable to them.

<F P=106> [Article by B.I.W.: "Speaker Struzik Will Ask Prime Minister </F>
for a Substantive Talk With `S'; People Do Not Like To Be 
Slighted"] 
  [Text] "The speaker will suggest to the prime minister 
that our talk be about specifics, that it be substantive, and 
that it lead to solutions that would end this dispute and allow 
us to take a breath," Solidarity ["S"] Chairman Marian 
Krzaklewski told RZECZPOSPOLITA after the Tuesday [15 March] 
meeting with Senate Speaker Adam Struzik of the Polish Peasant 
Party. If the meeting with Waldemar Pawlak does not result in 
negotiations, "S" will announce the preparation of a "schedule 
of broader pressure." There may be a mass protest, a strike 
cumbersome to the people, as a reaction to the deteriorating 
material situation of employees; however, there may also be a 
doubly-strong reaction to the slighting of the people by the 
authorities. "Such a reaction is often greater because people 
do not like to be slighted by the authorities," said the "S" 
chairman. 
<H5>  The First "Exchange of Views" </H5>
  At the press conference, Krzaklewski said that the meeting 
with the Senate speaker was "the first platform for an exchange 
of views" with the authorities. The talk, to which he was 
invited by Struzik, served, among other purposes, as "the 
preparation of the ground" for the Friday meeting with Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak. "I drew the speaker's attention to 
the fact that the talk with the prime minister cannot be 
prepared in advance, be courteous, and be held only for the sake 
of being held. If this is what the government thought, the 
scenario for further developments will be more dramatic." 
  Asked about whether Struzik is playing the role of a 
mediator 
in the talks between "S" and the government, Krzaklewski said 
that "one can certainly speak about the role of a mediator, but 
not just that" because the speaker "is not a neutral person." 
  According to the "S" head, during that meeting he discussed 
the strike situation and the union demands; both of them debated 
them and "jointly sought ways to reach agreement": methods, 
scope, and consistency in implementing these demands. 
Krzaklewski added that, before that, Struzik had forwarded a 
letter to "S," in which he signaled the possibilities of 
including the issues suggested by the union in the Senate 
debate. The "S" head is not counting on a radical change in the 
Budget Law, but on "resolving the problem through decisions 
around the budget." 
  Krzaklewski stated that he and Struzik had come to a mutual 
conclusion that "it is bad that so far no substantive talk on 
the demands has been held, and that the polemic is being held 
through the mass media." According to them, the "information 
hype in the mass media" impedes agreement, even though they have 
similar views. Both of them agreed that there must be more 
direct contacts between the parliament and the trade unions. 
  The speaker and the "S" head also discussed "issues 
concerning the political system": implementation of the "Pact on 
Enterprise" and giving state property to citizens. 
<H5>  Clubs and a Serious Force </H5>
  According to Krzaklewski, the government treats agreement 
with "S" as a concession to a serious force, the only opponent 
(with the current parliamentary majority, it does not need to be 
afraid of either the president or the opposition), which may 
become stronger after agreement is reached. During the 
protests, the union saw what the real program of the center left 
is really like, and it turned out, said the "S" head, that many 
parties have an antiemployee program. 
  Asked about "S" political clubs, Krzaklewski said that the 
decisions must be made by the union's congress; however, for the 
time being, "S" cannot afford to "draw attention to specific 
issues" because it must implement important union tasks. The 
"S" head added that he could see the necessity for the union 
activists to get in touch with people and that discussions, 
without the establishment of any parties and the usage of the 
"S" sign, are within the limits of trade union activities. 
Krzaklewski would like to take advantage of these contacts by 
building "the broadest possible contract," a contract for names 
and for the resolution of problems before the self-governmental 
elections." 
<H5>  Pickets and Strikes </H5>
  Yesterday the action was joined by the Swietokrzyski Region, 
with the strike by the plant in Konskie as well as the Slupsk 
Region (among other strikes, the strike by the Uska Shipyard). 
National Committee Press Spokesman Piotr Zak explained that 24 
miners who are on strike in the "Andaluzja" mine went 
underground and submitted not only wage demands to the Bytom 
Coal Partnership, but also national "S" demands. Zak says that 
a similar situation may develop in the "Silesia" mine, which 
belongs to the Vistula partnership. 
  Today, from 0400 to 0800, the municipal transportation 
establishments in the Katowice Voivodship (among other places, 
in Katowice, Sosnowiec, and Zawiercie) will go on strike. 
Contrary to earlier statements, Bydgoszcz will strike only 
today. Also, Bialystok will participate in a protest on 
Thursday, when the union's "popiwek [tax on excessive wage 
increases] picketing begins in front of the Sejm. The picketing 
is supposed to end regardless of whether the new popiwek law is 
passed.

  [Text] Warsaw, 17 Mar--Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] 
leader Aleksander Kwasniewski was asked today by "Radio Three" 
what he thinks about the alleged dilemma of the president, who 
appears to be thinking of whether or not to sign the budget as 
preelection promises have not been fulfilled. Kwasniewski 
replied that the "president, who on several occasions promised 
us various programs and failed to fulfill any, should show more 
patience in judging the implementation of programs by the 
four-month-old government." 
  "The president has more programs to explain after over three 
years in office," Kwasniewski added, at the same time calling 
for a renunciation of disputes and a search for a basis of 
cooperation between the government, the coalition, and the 
president. 
  The SLD leader also said that "by not signing the budget, 
the 
president will make Poland look ridiculous, especially in a 
situation in which we have an agreement signed with the London 
Club and in which the budget has helped us to win the necessary 
confidence of the world."

<F P=106> [Article by Robert Jakubowski: "London Taken"] </F>
  [Text] After four years of talks, Poland has at last 
concluded a deal on a reduction of the debts it owes to 
commercial banks in the London Club. We still have to pay more 
than half of the $13-billion debt, but most of it does not have 
to be paid for several years' time. 
  Polish negotiators reached agreement with the commercial 
banks in Frankfurt on the night of Thursday to Friday [10-11 
March]. The chief of the Polish delegation, Krzysztof Krowacki, 
says that the entire Polish debt (including interest) will be 
reduced by 45.2 percent. Poland will purchase a part of the 
debt this year, but at a low price. The remainder will be 
converted into bonds with a term of 20 or 30 years. 
  During the four years of talks, Poland kept saying it wanted 
a 50-percent reduction in its debts, the same percentage waived 
by the Paris Club of commercial banks in 1990. But, over the 
past year, Krowacki spoke only of the "relativity" of the 
conditions necessary for a reduction. 
  Our negotiators were not so much concerned with the size of 
the reduction. Of greater concern was that Poland should not 
repay too much, at least not in the beginning. For the time 
being, we are not going to pay more than $400 million per year 
and, after five years, not more than $0.5 billion. 
  Following the news of the agreement, the price of the Polish 
debt on secondary markets fell from 46 to 41.5 cents. "If the 
price had risen, it woid have meant that the deal was a success 
for the banks," joked Krowacki. The dealers handling the Polish 
debt also explained the fallen price by the fact that Poland 
will repay its creditors less than expected, and much later than 
expected. 
  Prime Minister Pawlak said that the rapid and favorable 
agreement is largely attributable to the German banks. 
  "The Germans have the strongest links to the Polish economy, 
and that is why they wanted to see this deal concluded as 
quickly as possible," says James Lister-Cheese of the U.S. 
Morgan Stanley investment bank. 
  "The signing of the agreement means that, as of 1995, we are 
going to service our debts fully. In this way, our financial 
relations with the West will undergo a complete normalization," 
says Finance Minister Henryk Chmielak. 
  Banks and other financial institutions will be all the more 
willing to give us loans, and foreign investors will have more 
courage to enter Poland if the banks that finance them stop 
treating Poland as a high risk. 
  The conclusion of the agreement with the London Club was 
also 
one of the conditions imposed on us by the IMF and the World 
Bank.

  [Text] Warsaw, 16 Mar--Among 16 institutions in the Public 
Opinion Research Centre [CBOS] league table, the army enjoys the 
greatest confidence (79 percent) and the least disapproval (8 
percent) among the respondents. We have least confidence in 
private banks; nearly half of the respondents (47 percent) do 
not trust them. 
  The CBOS poll was conducted between 11 and 15 February of 
this year on a nationwide, random representative sample of 1,198 
adult members of Poland's population. 
  Number-two in the table is the ombudsman, who is trusted by 
71 percent of the public and distrusted by 11 percent. At 
number three comes public television, for which approval was 
expressed by 69 percent of the respondents and disapproval by 20 
percent. The next place went to the state police, in which 66 
percent of the respondents expressed confidence, while 27 
percent expressed a lack of it. 
  The authorities of the respondents' towns (parishes) and the 
church each enjoyed 54 percent of public confidence. 
Disapproval was expressed by 32 and 37 percent, respectively. 
  More than half of the respondents (51 percent) expressed 
confidence in the government, the Sejm, the courts, and the 
Supreme Chamber of Control. The greatest disapproval among 
these was expressed for the Sejm (35 percent) and the government 
(33 percent). 
  Among the central institutions, the poorest appraisal is 
given to the work of the president, who is trusted by 35 percent 
of the respondents but disapproved of by more than half (55 
percent). 
  In February, confidence in the activities of trade unions 
went up. Approval for Solidarity (40 percent) went up 15 points, 
while, for the National Trade Union Alliance, it rose by 10 
percentage points. The improved position of the trade unions 
probably resulted from the Warsaw demonstration by Solidarity, 
as well as from the recently more frequent appearances by 
representatives of these organizations in the mass media.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 16 (AFP) -- Belgrade has told the 
United Nations it approves of extending the UN Protection 
Force's (UNPROFOR) mandate in former Yugoslav republics 
bordering on Serbia and Montenegro, the daily POLITIKA said 
Wednesday. However, rump Yugoslavia, known formally as the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) and comprised of Serbia and 
Montenegro, envisages introducing visas for UNPROFOR members, 
the newspaper reported. The force's mandate, extended on October 
4, is due to expire March 31. "The FRY considers the UNPROFOR's 
presence in ex-Yugoslavia is necessary until a political 
agreement has been concluded on the existing problems," the 
paper quoted FRY Prime Minister Radoje Kontic as saying in a 
letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Rump 
Yugoslavia "supports the Vance (peace) plan (in parts of Croatia 
under Serb secessionist control) and wants it to be strictly 
applied," Kontic added. However, he recalled that rump 
Yugoslavia was hesitant about the force being staffed by 
countries which dominated the region in the past, such as 
Austria, Turkey and Germany. 
  Meanwhile the government committee on cooperation with the 
UNPROFOR decided, at a session chaired by Kontic, to introduce 
visas for UN peacekeepers. The government was to confirm the 
move shortly and decide what date the visa requirement should 
start, the newspaper said.

former Yugoslavia, Milan Martic, president of the republic of 
Serbian Krajina, and Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska 
republic, in Belgrade on 16 March; Churkin speaks in English 
with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Churkin] On Russia's initiative, official 
delegations from Zagreb and Knin will meet in the Russian 
Embassy in Zagreb on Tuesday, 22 March, in order to agree on the 
cessation of military and other hostilities. Thank you very 
much. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Does this mean that you want 
the Krajina to become a part of the Croatian state? 
  [Churkin] No, this only means that we want the hostilities 
to stop and we want the situation in this area to return to 
normal. We hope that such an agreement on the cessation of 
hostilities will contribute to an improvement and gradual 
normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations, because this is a 
very important element for the entire situation in the former 
Yugoslavia. [passage omitted] 
  [Churkin] This was a working meeting, one of many that we 
have had in the past year and a half. We discussed the 
prospects for a political solution of the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in light of the latest events, namely, the 
Muslim-Croatian concept of federation. I think that the bottom 
line we agreed on was that any kind of future political solution 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina must take into account the interests and 
sovereign rights of all three constituent peoples in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Muslims, Croats, and Serbs. We agreed 
that there are still paths to be explored in order to further 
the extremely difficult negotiating process. 
  [Karadzic] We are very satisfied with the fact that it is 
clear that the Serbian people have their sovereign rights to the 
same extent as the Croats and Muslims; we have, of course, 
stressed our need to have special relations with Serbia, 
Yugoslavia, that is, and we must look for a solution within this 
context, within the context of realizing our sovereign rights 
and (?particular) ties; for the time being we do not see a 
solution, but we do see the way to it.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 16 (TANJUG) -- President Slobodan 
Milosevic of Serbia and Russian President's special envoy and 
Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin discussed in Belgrade on 
Wednesday the peace process for the former Yugoslavia, the 
Russian initiatives and conditions for a political settlement of 
the crisis. Russia's efforts for disputes to be resolved 
peacefully, through talks and impartial mediation by the 
international community, were assessed as positive. 
  Milosevic and Churkin said they expected commitment to peace 
to be the essential feature of the further negotiations on the 
former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and set out that 
commitment to peace was a basis for the reaching of a political 
agreement and the fulfillment of the national and state 
interests of the three warring sides. 
  Before meeting with Milosevic, Churkin conferred with 
presidents Radovan Karadzic of the Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) 
and Milan Martic of the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK). The talk 
with Martic was part of a new Russian initiative for peace on 
the RSK territory, which is a U.N. protected area (UNPA). 
Churkin said after meeting with Martic that representatives of 
Croatia and the (republic of) Serb Krajina would meet at the 
Russian Embassy in Zagreb on March 22 to discuss the cessation 
of hostilities. Churkin said he felt it was impossible to 
resolve the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict without resolving the 
Croatia-Krajina problem. 
  The RSK was created in 1991 out of the predominantly 
Serb-populated areas within the administrative borders of the 
former Yugoslav republic of Croatia in response to Croatia's 
secession and the attempt of its authorities to reduce the Serb 
people to a national minority. The RSK was proclaimed a U.N. 
protected area (UNPA) in March last year.

  [Text] [Announcer] The Kosova Information Center reports 
that at approximately 0600 today, new movements of the Serbian 
Army, accompanied by tanks and trucks loaded with large caliber 
cannons, have been observed in Dushanove village in the 
direction of Gjakove. Meanwhile, there are reports of raids, 
harassments, and new arrests of Albanians throughout Kosova. For 
more, a telephone report by Ramadan Mucolli: 
  [Mucolli] The reports by the information commissions of the 
Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK] branches state that during the 
two last days, the Serbian police have continued their 
repression against Albanian families and citizens in various 
parts of the republic. In most cases, there have been raids and 
pursuits under the pretext of searching for arms, as well as 
beatings, harassments, and summons to informative talks with the 
Serbian state security bodies. 
  There are also reports of harassments and beatings of LDK 
activists and searches for youngsters with the aim of sending 
them to the Serbian Army. Raids on Albanian families on the 
pretext of searching for arms were conducted in Dumnice e 
Eperme, Magjunaj, Pantine, Strote in Vushtrri; and then in 
Guimir and Llakuqan in Gline; Popove, Batllave, Livadice, and 
Bradash in Podujeve; Livesht in Gjilan; Jonik in Decan; Kolace 
in Skenderaj; and Negrovc in Gllogovc. 
  In many of the cases, after the raids, the police summoned 
the family heads and members to be present at the Serbian state 
security bodies. The harassment of LDK activists is also 
reported. Arif Ejupi, chairman of the party sub-branch in 
Gllanik in Podujeve, was brutally beaten. While Ejup Aliu, 
chairman of the LDK group in Tarllabosh in Vushtrri, was 
summoned to the police station. Reports from this commune 
confirm that in Magjunaj, the police searched for the young man 
Bekim Magjuni, with the aim of sending him to the Serbian Army. 
  Harassments of Albanian citizens have been reported in other 
areas of Kosova, while in Kline, a Serbian citizen beat Jashar 
Doqi, a guard at the Animal Food Factory, who was on duty. 
  The Prishtina-based Council for the Defense of Human Rights 
and Freedoms reports that Serbian inspectors checked the 
headquarters of the National Unity Party and interrogated the 
chairman of this party, Bajrush Bajrami.

  [Text] Belgrade, 16 Mar (TANJUG) -- Special Russian envoy 
Vitaliy Churkin today said in Belgrade, following his talks with 
Radovan Karadzic, president of the Serb republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, that he believed that Karadzic had fulfilled 
his promise given in Moscow to open Tuzla airport. 
  Churkin noted that Karadzic had given this promise under two 
conditions: the presence of Russian military observers, which 
-- in his words -- was possible to organize within 48 hours, and 
the presence of Serb liaison officers, which was an element in 
the initial UN document on opening Tuzla airport. 
  The Russian envoy stressed that the other side did not 
accept 
the presence of Serb liaison officers at this airport but he 
nevertheless said he hoped other participants would continue 
negotiations with the Muslim government on this issue since this 
was a very important humanitarian issue. 
  We also agreed that in seeking a political solution for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina one should take account of the interests and 
sovereign rights of all three constituent peoples, he stressed. 
We agreed that there were ways of stimulating the difficult 
negotiating process, the Russian special envoy added. 
  Karadzic said that today's meeting was one in a series of 
working meetings characterized by a high degree of understanding 
and that he was satisfied with the fact that it had been stated 
in clear terms that the Serbs should have the same sovereign 
rights as the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia. The Serb side is 
trying to adjust its interests to the situation as we are 
determined to contribute to a final solution, particularly 
peace, Karadzic said. He stressed that the Serbs in Bosnia have 
a need for special relations with Yugoslavia. We must seek 
solutions within this framework, Karadzic said in conclusion.

<F P=106> [By Stevan Cordas] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, March 16 (TANJUG) -- Russian president's 
special envoy Vitaliy Churkin crowned his unexpected visit to 
Belgrade on Wednesday by announcing that Moscow was raising a 
new initiative for the resolution of the crisis in the former 
Yugoslavia. The initiative is aimed at having an agreement 
reached between the Republic of Croatia and the republic of Serb 
Krajina (RSK) on the cessation of hostilities and the restoring 
of peace. 
  Churkin and RSK President Milan Martic agreed in Belgrade on 
Wednesday that Krajina-Croatia talks be held at the Russian 
Embassy in Zagreb on March 22. 
  The conflict between Krajina and Croatia broke out in 1991 
because of Croatia's forcible secession from the former 
Yugoslavia and the attempt of its authorities to reduce the Serb 
people to a national minority. 
  The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 on ethnically and 
historically 
Serb territories within the administrative borders of the former 
Yugoslav republic of Croatia. The RSK was proclaimed a U.N. 
protected area (UNPA) in March 1992. 
  After meeting with Martic, Churkin conferred separately with 
Bosnian Serb Leader Radovan Karadzic and President Slobodan 
Milosevic of Serbia and left for Zagreb in the afternoon. 
Churkin is due to leave from Zagreb for Washington on Thursday 
to meet with U.S. President's special envoy Charles Redman. 
  The new Russian initiative is in a way complementary with 
the 
U.S. initiative for the creation of a Moslem-Croat federation in 
the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its 
subsequent confederation with Croatia. 
  The new Russian peace initiative indicates that Moscow has 
arrived at the conclusion that no overall political settlement 
is possible in Bosnia-Herzegovina without a solution for the 
krajina-Croatia issue. 
  On the other hand, the United States considers the agreement 
on a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina to be of the 
utmost importance at this point. However, the agreement has 
completed only the first stage of the U.S. peace initiative. 
The second stage, that is, the reaching of an overall 
settlement for Bosnia- Herzegovina, will not be possible without 
the Bosnian Serbs and Russia. 
  It remains to be seen how Washington intends to clear the 
way 
for the second stage of the peace initiative. It is aware that 
the initiative cannot be successful without the Bosnian Serbs 
and it is no doubt seriously counting on Russia to lend a 
helping hand. 
  The announced Churkin-Redman talks should most likely be 
viewed in that light, and it would be no surprise if the special 
U.S. envoy was soon to visit Belgrade again.

session of the convention of the Serbian Democratic Parties 
[SDS] of the Serbian Lands, which was attended by members of the 
SDS of the Serbian Lands from east Slavonia, Baranja, and 
western Srem, who adopted with acclamation the convention on the 
unification of all SDS into one party that was signed in Pale on 
7 November 1993, was held in Borovo Naselje yesterday. The 
membership accepted with acclamation that the SDS of the Serbian 
Lands cease work and transfer their powers to President Radovan 
Karadzic and a main committee. 
  Radovan Karadzic, president of the SDS of the Serbian Lands, 
presented the program aims of the united party. According to 
Karadzic, which is something he insisted on throughout his 
speech, the aim of the SDS of the Serbian Lands is not to win 
power, but to realize its program in the interest of the people 
-- "winning power is the means to accomplish this." One of the 
main tasks of the party is reinstate the traditional values of 
the Serbian people. 
<H5>  State Unity -- The Basis of Everything </H5>
  On our path to realize the program, Karadzic said, there are 
several priorities. The first priority is to overcome the 
divisions in the Serbian nation in every respect, especially 
tribal divisions. 
  "The state unity is left for the end and this unity is in 
fact the beginning of everything," Karadzic said. The state is 
a guarantee for the survival of a nation. The time has come for 
the Serbs to finish what Karadjordje had started. The phrase 
frequently misused in the world is "great Serbia." Russia is 
big, and Serbia is as big as it is. Once all Serbian lands are 
incorporated, they will make up some 150,000 square meters. 
  The Serbs in the Serbian Republic, Karadzic said, have their 
territory and are controlling it; they have their own nation and 
effective authorities. These are the elements needed for the 
existence of a country, which was also admitted by UN 
representative Akashi. However, the military victory is only 
one step and this military victory should be turned into a 
political and diplomatic victory. After that we should seek the 
recognition of sovereignty. 
  After the constituent session and the speech by President 
Karadzic on the party's program, the delegates held a meeting 
behind closed doors at which they discussed the new program and 
the statute of the party. Dr. Karadzic then held a news 
conference. 
  Regarding the opening of Tuzla airport, Karadzic said that 
he 
had reached an agreement with a Russian diplomat on the 
conditions needed to be met for the opening of the airport. 
These are the guarantees that the airport will not be used for 
military purposes. However, the Muslims have started the spring 
offensive on Mount Ozren in an attempt to capture Modrica and 
Doboj, which, according to Karadzic, is the first stage of 
breaking through the corridor. 
  "We will say very clearly, and I am saying this to you now, 
that if the Muslims do not stop their offensive, we will not 
make any territorial concessions. The Muslims cannot be 
guaranteed 30 percent of the territory and allowed to continue 
fighting against us. Since they have opted to fight, they will 
then get as much territory as they win. Had they opted for 
political talks in time, we would have come to certain 
arrangements in a peaceful way." 
  The statement by Alija Izetbegovic that 64 percent of the 
territory will belong to the Muslim-Croat federation, according 
to Karadzic, is simply a provocation directed at the Serbs to 
reject this idea. This would then be used as the reason to 
reject the Washington agreement. Karadzic claims that neither 
the Croats nor the Muslims want the agreement, which they were 
forced to sign. They are looking for reasons and motives to 
break the talks and the agreement. Radovan Karadzic then 
confirmed that the talks with the Russians were difficult 
because, "contrary to the erroneous belief in the world, the 
Russians are not our protectors in the sense the that Americans 
are the protectors of the Muslims." 

<H5>    Secret Signals to Serbs </H5>
  "Russia is playing a constructive role and we must clearly 
say that Russia is not partial toward the Serbs. Russia is 
trying to be objective and it is in its interest that a solution 
be found as soon as possible. Whether this solution is 
favorable for the Serbs or not, they are not asked about it that 
much. However, we are here to say that such a solution is not a 
solution for us. Nevertheless, I think that Russia has a 
correct view on all this and that the Russians will realize that 
it is in their interests that the Serbs realize their aims, 
because these aims could not be against Russia's interests." 
  Answering the question as to whether Russia had prevented 
NATO's military intervention in the Serbian Republic, Karadzic 
expressed the view that NATO was relieved when Russia entered 
the game. According to Karadzic, in this game with NATO, the 
European Union ejected itself from the game. 
  The Serbs are now receiving secret signals from certain 
European capitals. They now want to achieve through the Serbs 
the kind of results achieved by Churkin. They missed their 
chance and we no longer have reason to deal with European 
capitals. If Russia and the United State are here, we will deal 
with them, with those that can bring about a solution, Radovan 
Karadzic said. 
<H5>  [Box, p 11] </H5>
<H5>  Karadzic on Churkin's Statement in Zagreb </H5>
  The most interesting remark was certainly Karadzic's view on 
the statements by Vitaliy Churkin in Zagreb on the possibility 
of the Serbs entering the federation with the Croats and the 
Muslims in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "This is possible but not probable," Dr. Karadzic said. "We 
are allowing for the possibility of discussing all this and do 
not want to spoil what the Croats and the Muslims are doing. 
This is their right, as long as it does not affect the Serbs in 
the Serbian Republic and the Serbian Republic of Krajina. I ask 
myself somewhat naively: Why would it be natural for the Serbs 
to live with the Croats and the Muslims and not with the Serbs. 
I have no answer to this simple question."

<F P=106> [Hajrudin Sermic report from Maglaj] </F>
  [Text] Maglaj has again been shelled heavily today. Just 
before 1100 the chetniks opened fierce artillery fire at the 
town and the surrounding area, unselectively destroying 
residential quarters. Only at 1400, when NATO bombers appeared 
and swooped over them, did their guns fall silent. Some 30 
destructive shells were fired from multiple rocket launchers at 
the town, killing one person and inflicting serious wounds on 
two others. 
  So the suffering of the population of this town is 
continuing 
with new brutality every day, and things are only made worse by 
hunger. There is no sign of the convoy with food that has been 
announced for today, as Karadzic's mob is still preventing the 
entry of the aid that is so needed in Maglaj.

<F P=106> [Report by Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence </F>
correspondent] 
  [Text] Patrol groups of elite SAS [Special Air Service] 
troops are believed to be operating inside the besieged Muslim 
enclave of Maglaj in northern Bosnia. 
  Their presence underscores the determination of United 
Nations commander Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose to lift 
the nine-month siege. 
  Surrounded by Serb artillery and mortars, the 20,000 
inhabitants have been surviving on airdropped food in appalling 
conditions. The last convoy to reach Maglaj was in October. UN 
relief officials who visited the area in January reported 
"larders bare and children nothing more than skin and bones." 
  Lt. Gen. Rose, who has spent much of his Army career with 
the 
SAS, plans to open the enclave to aid convoys preferably with 
Serb consent but using a more muscular approach if necessary. 
  With most of Bosnia quiet under two cease-fires, the Serbs 
are being pressured by the international community -- including 
their traditional ally Russia -- to halt attacks on the town. 
  Lt. Gen. Rose dropped several teams of armed British 
soldiers 
into the Muslim enclave earlier this week to assess the 
situation. The Ministry of Defence in London maintained its 
usual "no comment" on special forces operations. 
  However, trained to operate in small self-sufficient patrol 
teams of as few as four men, the SAS are the ideal 
reconnaissance troops to feed back information on frontline 
positions, weapons and conditions in the area. They will report 
back directly to the headquarters of Lt. Gen. Rose, who 
undoubtedly made the request for their assistance. 
  Although the use of SAS-type units in a UN peacekeeping 
operation is unusual it is not unique. American Delta Force 
troops were sent to Somalia last year in an abortive attempt to 
capture the warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 17 March carries within 
its regular 8-minute newscast several reports on the combat 
situation in the republic. 
  Reporting from the Press Center of the 370th Brcko Brigade, 
correspondent Dijana Hadzic says that ``after being defeated by 
the members of the armed forces of our country yesterday, the 
chetniks today continued their fierce shelling of the defense 
lines of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the 
operational zone of Operation Group West and the Bugojno city 
center from the direction of Kupres and Donji Vakuf. 
  ``In a strong counterattack the free territory of our 
country 
has been expanded. The fighters of the 370th Brcko Brigade at 
[word indistinct] captured a T-55 tank, an antiaircraft gun, 
mortars, and a large quantity of infantry weapons and equipment. 
In fierce fighting, the aggressor lost 30 soldiers. 
  "Members of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
from Donji Vakuf's 370th Brcko Brigade are scoring only 
successes in this region. In less than 24 hours the enemy has 
lost another two T-55 tanks. A general danger alert is in force 
in Bugojno as we report." 
  According to Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic, "after the 
bestial shelling of Bihac and the outskirts of Cazin yesterday, 
in which one person was killed and several wounded, the night in 
the Bihac and Cazin area was somewhat quieter. Nevertheless, 
the chetniks sporadically shelled their old targets, the suburbs 
of Bihac, the outskirts of Cazin, the Bihac-Cazin road, and the 
industrial zone." 
  Sadikovic also reports that a "new artillery-tank attack was 
launched on the Grmusko-Srbjanski plateau early this morning," 
and that "the attack is still in progress." 
  Travnik correspondent Ahmet Begicevic reports that "owing to 
the shelling, a general danger alarm was sounded in Travnik at 
about 2200 [2100 GMT] last night. The chetniks fired an 
artillery shell at the town from the Vlasic plateau, causing 
substantial material damage and wounding one person. Travnik 
was also sporadically shelled overnight. At 0730 this morning, 
the general danger alarm was sounded again after another shell 
had been fired on the town." 
  According to the studio announcer, "the extremists of the 
Croatian Defense Council [HVO] seriously violated the cease-fire 
agreement on several occasions yesterday, especially in the 
central parts of Mostar, the Information Service of the 4th Army 
Corps reports. The fighters of Vinko Martinovic yesterday 
violated the cease-fire that is otherwise being observed across 
the entire operational zone of the 4th Army Corps. Members of 
this formation fired several times using an RPG [expansion 
unknown] and splinter ammunition at the line of separation from 
the direction of the Health Center. The HVO extremists also 
attacked the road junction near the bus station in Mostar with a 
sower of death [M-84 machine gun]. Provocations continued 
throughout the night. 
  "Regarding the latest serious violation of the agreement on 
the cessation of hostilities, the Command of the 4th Army Corps 
has lodged a protest with the Spanish UN battalion, expecting 
the representatives of the peace forces finally to do something, 
considering that previous warnings have not yielded any results. 
(?Similar) provocations by irresponsible groups and individuals 
from the HVO were also registered on the Prozor front, in the 
Orahovica region. 
  "The defense lines in this part of the 4th Army Corps' 
operational zone were also the target of artillery attacks by 
the Serbian aggressor, especially in the region of (?Djelimic), 
the Information Service of the 4th Army Corps reports."

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, March 16 (TANJUG) -- Clashes between the 
forces of local Muslims and Croats are continuing in the central 
and southern part of the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, despite the signed agreement on the creation 
of a Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
military agreement between the two sides. 
  In central Bosnia-Herzegovina, the forces of local Croats, 
Croatian Defense Council troops and Croatian regular army troops 
opened on Wednesday sniper fire on the positions of Muslim 
forces in the surroundings of Gornji Vakuf. In the valley of 
the River Lasva Croatian forces are digging trenches and keep on 
shifting the line of separation, Muslim Radio Sarajevo announced. 
  Over five thousand troops of the Croatian regular army are 
still fighting in the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, although 
the deadline fixed by the Security Council for their withdrawal 
-- February 17 -- has long passed. 
  In the Mostar basin (southern Bosnia-Herzegovina) strong 
explosions resounded on Tuesday, with the occasional use of 
small arms and the air defense guns of Croatian and Muslim 
forces -- the military sources of Bosnian Serbs said. Muslim 
Radio Sarajevo reported that the Croatian Defense Council 
continued on Wednesday attacks on Muslim positions. 
  Muslim military sources announced on Tuesday that Croatian 
Defense Council units opened sniper fire on passers by on the 
Mostar-Blagal road, so that representatives of the Spanish 
batallion within UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] were forced to 
intervene. 
  The military sources of Bosnian Serbs report that Croatian 
Defense Council troops opened fire on Tuesday on the line of 
separation in Mostar. In Blagaj, south of Mostar, which is 
under Muslim control, two strong explosions were heard Tuesday 
evening, and a Croatian helicopter opened fire in the 
surroundings of Bijelo Polje north of Mostar Tuesday night. 
  Representatives of Bosnian Croats and Muslims signed in 
Washington on March 1, under strong U.S. pressure, a preliminary 
agreement on the formation of a federation of two peoples in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would later enter a confederation with 
Croatia. 
  Washington's concept is to make possible, by a maneuver of a 
dual state for Muslims, the continuation, even though partial, 
of a unitary Bosnia, the extension of the territory under Muslim 
control, an outlet to the sea for Muslims, and finally to create 
a strong negotiating (and if possible a military) block against 
Bosnian Serbs in the coming phase.

  [Text] Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of 
Croatia, received Russia's special envoy for former Yugoslavia, 
Vitaliy Churkin, this evening. After the talks the Russian 
diplomat told journalists that they discussed top-level 
negotiations between state representatives of the Republic of 
Croatia and representatives of the Serbs from the occupied parts 
of Croatia. A meeting has been scheduled for 22 March. It will 
take place at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. Having mentioned 
that he had already discussed these negotiations with President 
Tudjman, Vitaliy Churkin told domestic and foreign journalists: 
  [Begin Churkin recording, in English with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] The first thing to be done is to 
sign a very strong document guaranteeing that there would be no 
further fighting in the [UN] protected areas and around them. 
In the past few days we worked very hard in order to arrange a 
meeting at which an agreement would be signed. This agreement 
had been studied earlier, but for political reasons it was never 
either completed or signed. I hope that the agreement will be 
signed at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb on 22 March, but I am 
certain that it will not be easy. I hope that the attitude of 
the two sides would not be to try to squeeze out some 
concessions at the last minute, but to try to show that each 
side is the one which is being more constructive and prepared to 
make greater concessions for the sake of peace. 
  I hope that the attitude will not be technical, i.e., that 
they will not discuss how far, for instance, a particular cannon 
would have to be moved from a particular tree, so that the 
agreement could be implemented. I hope that the state approach 
-- based on a very strong desire for peace -- will prevail. I 
am certain that this desire exists both among the Croats and 
among the Serbs. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, March 16 (AFP) -- Croatian officials and 
representatives of the breakaway Croatian Serbs are to hold 
peace talks in Zagreb later this month, Russian special envoy 
Vitaly Churkin said here Wednesday [16 March] after talks with 
the breakaway Serbs. 
  Churkin met at the Russian Embassy with Croatian Serb 
leaders 
Milan Martic, Slobodan Jarcevic and General Milan Celeketic, 
declaring afterwards that they had agreed to peace talks in 
Zagreb next Tuesday [22 March]. 
  Martic, however, said he had agreed to attend the meeting on 
condition that that the Croatian delegation to the talks be 
headed by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. 
  The peace talks would mark the first time Serb leaders from 
the breakaway Krajina region travel to Zagreb since clashes 
between the two sides began in 1991. 
  The Russian Embassy in Zagreb said Churkin was expected back 
in Zagreb Wednesday afternoon to discuss the matter with Tudjman. 
  Before leaving Belgrade, however, he was scheduled to hold 
separate meetings with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. 
  The Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency said Karadzic had 
indicated 
he would be willing to discuss a proposed federation plan 
linking Croats and Moslems as long as it did not go counter to 
Serb interests. 
  The plan calls for Bosnia's Moslems and Croats to merge 
their 
territories in a loose Bosnian federation that could eventually 
be linked with Croatia. 
  Attempts to convince the Serbs to join the U.S.-brokered 
plan 
and end more than two years of bloodshed in Bosnia have so far 
proved fruitless. 
  Churkin, who is Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special 
envoy to the former Yugoslavia, and Milosevic met Monday to 
discuss possible Serb involvement in the proposed federation's 
constitution. 
  Churkin earlier this week also met Bosnian Serb leaders 
Momcilo Krajisnik and Nikola Koljevic. 
  The Belgrade daily BORBA said the U.S.-brokered federation 
plan would be discussed at a meeting here Wednesday involving 
Milosevic, Karadzic and Martic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Milan Martic, president of the republic of </F>
Serbian Krajina, by unidentified correspondents in Belgrade on 
16 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Martic] We did not discuss the future status of 
the republic of Serbian Krajina. We will deal with this problem 
in the coming period, and we have said that the problem of the 
republic of Serbian Krajina must be returned to the 
International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia since it is 
well known that we have not been present there for some time 
now. The Krajina is being discussed without the presence of the 
Krajina representatives. Therefore, I believe that in the near 
future, the Krajina will have its place at the Conference on the 
Former Yugoslavia, where this issue will be reviewed. However, 
generally, the issue of the Krajina will be solved on the 
principle of self-determination, something that has been 
guaranteed to all other peoples; we shall fight so that we in 
the republic of Serbian Krajina can also have this right. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] How did Mr. Churkin react to 
this? 
  [Martic] Well, quite correctly, and he supported the 
initiative to have our problem solved within the framework of 
the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Martic, has there been 
pressure for the Krajina to join the Muslim-Croat federation? 
  [Martic] There has been no pressure so far. Probably most 
of the pressures are now concentrated on that part of the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. I suppose that there will be [pressure]. 
However, nothing in the Krajina can be solved without the people 
of the republic of Serbian Krajina, without the legitimately 
elected institutions -- the parliament, government, president; 
we shall decide the future of the republic of Serbian Krajina 
within this framework. Moreover, I believe that the fate will 
be decided in a [word indistinct] new referendum before the 
international public, once we in the republic of Serbian Krajina 
are granted this right, the right to self-determination. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] In what phase are the 
negotiations, the direct negotiations, between the Krajina and 
Croatia? 
  [Martic] Well, for a long time we did not hold any 
negotiations for well-known reasons, because Croatia simply did 
not respect any peace agreements and continued with 
provocations, infiltrating terrorist groups like the one 
recently infiltrated into Lika where the Vojnic territory was 
taken back -- this is known -- then again recently, the 
infiltration of groups into the area of Banija, or more 
precisely, around Glina, where we have noticed a constant 
duality of the Croatian side [sentence as heard]; on one hand 
they are stressing peace, promoting peace in the world, yet on 
the other hand they are constantly provoking. [Words 
indistinct] as we have agreed today to negotiate a cessation of 
hostilities, to establish peace, which certainly does not mean a 
political solution for either the Krajina or Croatia. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What were your conditions for 
going to Zagreb? 
  [Martic] We certainly stressed that it has got to be known 
that this is not the territory of the Republic of Croatia, that 
this is extraterritorial since it is the Russian Embassy, and 
with maximum security -- which we do not doubt -- and which will 
be taken care of by Russia, by its representatives, that is, so 
that our delegation can feel they are on neutral ground and that 
they can negotiate on completely equal terms. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Who will be in your delegation? 
  [Martic] Well, we will elect a delegation, probably 
comprising the defense minister, the foreign minister, we shall 
see, we shall come to a decision in a couple of days. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Were you pressured by Belgrade 
to accept this agreement? 
  [Martic] No, no. We held correct talks with Belgrade and 
the official authorities, but we have been given the initiative 
to decide our own fate; of course, we can accept 
well-intentioned suggestions from anyone, particularly 
suggestions that are well-intentioned -- and that has always 
been the case so far -- and we accept the suggestions of the 
ruling cadre of the Republic of Serbia. However, we were not 
pressured. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] (?Will you be meeting with 
Milosevic)? 
  [Martic] I probably will. This cooperation is simply 
necessary and it was never discontinued.

<F P=106> [Interview with Josip Manolic, chairman of the Chamber of </F>
Counties of the Croatian Assembly, by Heni Erceg; place and date 
not given: "Susak Must Go"] 
  [Excerpt] [Erceg] To what extent will the Washington 
agreement, which envisages the end of the war between the 
Muslims and Croats, help toward the settlement of the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? How can the Bosnian Serbs be won to sign 
the agreement? 
  [Manolic] This agreement is opening the door to the 
settlement of all problems in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of course, it 
is much easier to solve the problem between the Muslims and the 
Croats than that with the Serbs. The war between the Muslims 
and the Croats should have never started, and was more the case 
of unfortunate circumstances than of policies working in the 
interests of either the Muslim or the Croat sides. In the search 
for the answer to the question of how to include the Bosnian 
Serbs in the negotiations, one should go back to the beginning 
of the Serbian aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the ethnic 
cleansing, and the killing, which resulted in the conquest of 
about 70 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Despite this, Serbia did not manage to force its opponents to 
capitulate. This fact will actually affect their future 
conduct. They will have to decide whether to carry on with the 
war to the end, until the military defeat of one or the other 
side, or stop at this point and join efforts to solve the future 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Karadzic and those around him will, in 
any case, have to explain to their people why the war was waged 
and why lives have been lost. 
<H5>  Why Were Lives Lost? </H5>
  [Erceg] Will the Croatian politicians who accepted the war 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina have to answer the same question? 
  [Manolic] Yes, this question will also be raised here, 
although I think that it is more important at present to 
concentrate efforts on the consistent implementation of the 
agreement. This means observing peace, searching for an 
internal solution that would suit everyone in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and providing constitutional guarantees to 
each group. 
  [Erceg] You are therefore not questioning common life in 
Bosnia, like some other politicians who have been claiming for 
some time that cohabitation in this state has always been false? 
  [Manolic] Those who have been advocating such views, in the 
Assembly and outside it, should today feel ashamed of their 
statements, because these statements were not founded on either 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's past or present. 
  [Erceg] So, there is a sudden turnabout in attitudes toward 
the Muslims. President Tudjman says that the current denouement 
is the result of "consistency in Croatia's policies." What do 
you think about this? Has this policy indeed been consistent? 
  [Manolic] The thesis that is in circulation, as you can see, 
is that there is no turnabout in the policy and that this policy 
has consistently been implemented. However, if one looks at the 
development of Croatian-Muslim relations, one could see 
turnabouts and changes. Did we not first wage a war with the 
Muslims against the common enemy, the Serbs, did we not then 
clash with the Muslims, and are we not, today, again looking for 
ways of cohabiting in Bosnia-Herzegovina and a peaceful solution 
to the conflict? Every normal person will conclude that two 
turnabouts were made. I do not have anything against everyone 
adhering to their own assertions and theses. However, one 
should not impose one's own views, by using deceits and by 
passing the ball to the opponents' court, that all those who 
have been claiming that the war against the Muslims should never 
have taken place, or that such destruction and genocide, for 
which both sides are responsible, were unnecessary, were wrong. 
  [Erceg] You, Stipe Mesic, and some other people were in 
favor of preserving Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole. Why were you 
not listened to? 
  [Mesic] The situation in politics is not the same as in the 
army. The dispute in the Croatian Democratic Community, which 
happened over the policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, was won by 
the faction that, favoring the war option in Bosnia, did not 
anticipate all the consequences for Croatia and its interests. 

<H5>    Minority Was Right </H5>
  [Erceg] The struggle between two factions in the Croatian 
Democratic Community was in fact a struggle for Tudjman's 
support. The solution to many problems, including that of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, depended on this support. 
  [Manolic] It is normal that a faction that prevails in 
politics should play the lead role. One can remain in a 
minority with his own views, but this, of course, does not mean 
that one is wrong. This only means that one should let time 
reveal the value of his policies. 
  [Erceg] Will the proponents of such a Croatian policy be an 
obstacle to the realization of the Croatian-Muslim agreement or 
will they have to go? 
  [Manolic] The values of the multiparty system are such that 
even the line detrimental to the state can win sometimes. The 
Croatian policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina in the last two years 
has been between a rock and a hard place. While the opposition 
and the ruling party were united over the Serbian aggression, 
they were divided over the clash between the Croats and the 
Muslims. 
  [Erceg] I will repeat the question: Will some people 
represent an obstacle....? 
  [Manolic] Yes, a number of people will be an obstacle to the 
realization of the agreement with the Muslims. 
  [Erceg] Who are these people? 
  [Manolic] Gojko Susak [defense minister], for instance. He 
should not be seen only as a carrier pigeon between Zagreb and 
Grude, but also as a man responsible for that policy, as well as 
for statements and moves regarding the clash between the Croats 
and the Muslims. 
  [Erceg] Why do such people not resign and why is the 
institution of resignation almost unknown in politics in Croatia? 
  [Manolic] This only means that the mechanism of democratic 
institutions is not sufficiently effective to force the people 
responsible for the conflict to resign. 
  [Erceg] Were you ever afraid of a conflict among the Croats 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina because of the duality in the Croatian 
politics: Two completely different policies were applied toward 
the Croats in Herzegovina and the Croats in central Bosnia. 
  [Manolic] You know, about 10 months ago a proponent of the 
war option asked me: "Why are the Herzegovina Croats fighting at 
all when one half of the Croatian nation is against their 
Herceg-Bosna?" This question has not been answered to this date. 
Both history and the proponents of that policy will have to 
answer this question. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tirana, March 12 (ATA) -- The Albanian 
representative in the United Nations, Mr. Pellumb Kulla, in a 
letter sent on March 10 to the secretary general, Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, and the head of the Security Council, French 
Ambassador Jean Bertrand Merime [name as received], called their 
attention to the recent increase in the Serbian pressure on 
Kosova as well as to the danger of a possible expansion of the 
conflict, which would have consequences for the whole region. 
  "I ask that the Security Council conduct an investigation of 
the situation in Kosova at the earliest possible time, and I 
repeat the appeals of the Albanian Government for a discussion 
as soon as possible of measures that might be taken in order to 
prevent further conflict in Kosova," writes Ambassador Kulla. 
  The Albanian ambassador asks for the immediate discussion of 
the sending of United Nations troops to Kosova in order to 
prevent the spread of the conflict from Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
Kosova and asks at the same time that his letter be circulated 
as an official document of the Security Council. 
  On the subject of ethnic cleansing against the Albanians in 
Kosova, the ambassador writes that "hundreds of Albanian homes 
have been raided and 3,400 Albanians have suffered from Serbian 
police violence, and most of them have been imprisoned. In many 
cases, the Serbian police have ordered Albanian families, under 
the threat of death, to leave their homes and emigrate from 
Kosova. 
  Mr. Kulla also condemns the political trials against 
Albanians, stressing that "defendants have been tortured, 
serious procedural errors have been committed, and sentences 
have been excessive."

  [Text] Tirana, March 12 (ATA) -- "Montenegro militiamen 
were too hard on us. They kept us for 68 hours in a cell deep 
under the ground without electricity, in the middle of urine, on 
a cement floor, without food and blankets. We have been beaten 
with batons," said the socialist deputy Moikom Zeqo in a 
statement made yesterday to Albanian TV. 
  The deputy Zeqo and the chairman of the Party of the 
National 
Unity, Mr. Idajet Beqiri, were arrested two days earlier in 
Montenegro accused of illegal entry into the country. The 
accused have denied the charge. After a staged trial in 
Montenegro, the two Albanians were sentenced to twenty days in 
prison, which was reduced to ten days upon appeal. 
  Mr. Zeqo has addressed a protest against the acts of 
Montenegro police to the European Parliament, President Clinton, 
and the People's Assembly of the Republic of Albania.

  [Text] Tirana, March 17 (ATA) -- Parliament of Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] would soon 
approve a draft law on secondary school, which is another 
discriminating aspect towards education in Albanian language in 
this republic. According to reports from Skopje, the law 
contains discriminating articles and restrains the Albanians 
from full access to education. One of the articles states that 
only translated text books will be used in those schools where 
classes are taught in Albanian. Most of the draft's articles 
run counter to statements by Macedonian authorities for equality 
among all the citizens in Macedonia. 
  Sources from Skopje say that Albanians will not have the 
right to prepare original text books with a content to be 
outlined by they themselves in case the draft law is approved as 
proposed. According to the draft law, one of the requirements 
for a professor to teach in these schools is that he should be a 
Macedonian citizen and should have a full command of the 
Macedonian standard language.

  [Text] Prague--The Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not 
believe that the eventual visit by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to the 
Czech Republic, "if it is meant seriously," could favorably 
contribute to the development of Czech-Russian relations. This 
is said in the ministry statement that was provided yesterday by 
the director of its Press Department, Marek Skolil. He added 
that the Ministry only learned about Zhirinovskiy's intention to 
visit the Czech Republic from the press. According to earlier 
comments by the Legal and Consular Section of the Czech Foreign 
Ministry, Zhirinovskiy's visit cannot be prevented. He is a 
regularly elected deputy of the Russian State Duma, which gives 
him a legal right to the diplomatic passport of the Russian 
Federation. Not even the newly drafted visa-free travel 
agreement between the Czech Republic and the Russian Federation 
will change anything on the status of the holders of diplomatic 
passports. 
  According to the Prague Lawyer Firm of Tomas Hofmann, LL.B., 
Zhirinovskiy can come to the Czech Republic without an 
invitation. Should he violate any law here, however, he can be 
prosecuted like any other person who violates the legally 
protected interests of the Czech Republic.

  [Text] Warsaw, 16 Mar--Wednesday is the second day of an 
official visit to our country by Suphachai Planitchapak, the 
deputy prime minister of Thailand. During a meeting with Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak, the state of economic and trade 
relations between both countries was discussed, while 
possibilities for investing in Poland were the topic of a 
conversation with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy. 
  It was agreed during the meeting with Pawlak that both 
countries' ministers responsible for commerce would prepare a 
list of goods for mutual trade. The establishment of mutual 
banking contacts was also considered important. 
  The balance of foreign trade was also discussed. The balance 
is unfavorable to Poland. In 1992, there was a negative balance 
of approximately $280 million. The deficit is due, among other 
things, to large imports of Thai consumer goods, mostly textile 
products (clothing and underwear), by private companies. 
  Thailand is ready to invest capital in Polish markets, Sejm 
Speaker Oleksy said after the meeting with Thailand's deputy 
prime minister. 
  On Thursday [17 March], on the third and last day of the 
visit, the Thai politician will be received by President Lech 
Walesa and will meet journalists.

<F P=106> [Article by Miodrag Perovic: "Herzeg-Montenegro"] </F>
  [Text] "Take me east of Suez where there is no difference 
between the best and the worst," Rudyard Kipling wished once. 
This week it was not necessary to travel that far in order to 
reach a world in which fantasy and reality meet. The second DPS 
[Democratic Party of Socialists] congress was the place in which 
the desired and the twisted world in which we live, led by the 
DPS and its leaders, were equalized. 
  DPS members said in the congress that they were devoted to 
democracy, but at the same time they use wiretaps and physical 
threats and misuse the media, which are more brutal than the 
communist television during the last 50 years. They claim to be 
establishing a constitutional state and torture people in 
prisons. They make statements in which they point out that they 
pursue the politics of peace and friendly relations with their 
neighbors, but they have obviously forgotten that they led a war 
outside Montenegro and sowed 250 graves over the country for 
Montenegrin youngsters who died in that war. They pretend to be 
developing a civilized state, while supporting ethnic cleansing 
not only in Bosnia, but also in Boka Kotorska and in northern 
Montenegro. They support political pluralism and parliamentary 
democracy but they arm their political followers. They boast 
about the safety Montenegro citizens allegedly have, but they 
"forget" to mention the act of kidnapping in Strpci, in which 
they were involved. They are trying to convince us that their 
foreign policy is constructive and assessed positively by the 
whole world, but their plane can only fly to Greece in order to 
buy furniture for their new apartments there. They are open to 
all democratic ideas, but "their attitudes are completely 
identical" with those of the fascist Zhirinovsky. They 
conducted a "secret" poll about public matters and invited the 
manager of an "independent" institute of an "autonomous" 
university to the party congress in order to read what they 
wrote for him. Their bells [the state media] were ringing two 
days long telling us that according to that objective poll more 
than 70 percent of the 1,000 respondents support Yugoslavia, but 
they did not say that less than 5 percent supported an alliance 
of Serbian states, called Yugoslavia, into which they want to 
push Montenegro, too. 
  Momir Bulatovic and Milo Djukanovic revived the idea that 
Montenegro and Herzegovina should merge. They did not state the 
reasons, so we cannot think of their opposite in order to know 
what their real motives are, but let us mention two possible 
reasons in order to make things clearer. One of the reasons is 
to offer the greedy and disoriented Montenegrins the chance to 
spread to Herzegovina. In this way they would be silenced -- 
they would not dare oppose the process of making Montenegro a 
Serbian province. They would perhaps not become a national 
minority, but a weak majority in their own state. The second 
reason reveals that the constructors of a greater-Serbia in 
Bosnia have difficulties. If the Muslim-Croatian federation is 
accomplished, there are good chances that the territories along 
the Drina River in Eastern Bosnia will be annexed to it, 
regardless of the fact that they are ethnically clean now. If 
Serbs oppose the tripartite federation and if Bosnia enters two 
confederations, with Croatia and Serbia, there is the 
possibility that Serbian territories in Bosnia be divided into 
two separate parts. In this case, Herzegovina would be 
connected with Serbia through Montenegro as a member state of 
the alliance of Serbian states. 
  The DPS, led by Bulatovic and Djukanovic, keeps on denying 
Montenegro as a state. In the alliance of Serbian states, 
although its name might be Yugoslavia, there is no place for 
Montenegrin individuality, there are no conditions to cherish 
the national, cultural, religious, and other authentic 
Montenegrin traditions. The Serbian Institute for the 
Protection of Monuments was given the task of renovating the 
Romanesque church of Sveti Luka in Kotor. After the renovation 
the original dome without a square pedestal was turned into the 
Raska School type dome with a high square pedestal. This example 
illustrates how dull the (post)communist Montenegro is. It also 
shows the Serbian attitude toward Montenegrin cultural heritage 
and its future in any union of Serbian states. 
  The DPS members who gave standing ovations to the university 
assistant from Podgorica, should know that they are participants 
in the crime being committed against Montenegro on their behalf 
and with their own hands. 
  The fact that this is interpreted as the people's wish does 
not change the essence.

  [Text] A consultative meeting of the Presidency and the 
government was held in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency 
building today, with only one item on the agenda -- scrutiny of 
the constitutional solution for the Federal Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the signing of the agreement with the 
Republic of Croatia. 
  The meeting was chaired by Bosnia-Herzegovina Deputy Prime 
Minister Edib Bukvic. Several suggestions were put forward in 
the debate that will be conveyed to our negotiators. It is 
expected that the Washington agreement will be signed by 
Presidents Izetbegovic and Tudjman, to be subsequently ratified 
by the deputies of our assembly. 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly session is expected to take 
place at the end of this month.

  [Text] A session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly that 
will, among other things, discuss the signing of the agreement 
on the federation between the Bosniaks, the Muslims, and the 
Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, will be held at the end of March 
or at the beginning of April this year, Assembly Chairman Miro 
Lazovic emphasized at today's session of a group of deputies of 
the republican Assembly from Sarajevo. 
  After the publication of the draft Bosnia-Herzegovina 
constitution and other documents that will be passed, it is 
necessary to immediately activate the constitutional commission, 
the human rights' commission, and the commission for the 
legislative-legal issues of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly in 
order to prepare the assembly session as best as possible, 
Assembly Secretary General Aldo Campara said. 
  I believe that the commissions should work in their full 
makeup, namely that the deputies of the Croatian Democratic 
Community [HDZ] should also take part in their work, while we 
must also secure the arrival of Deputy Assembly Chairman 
Mariofil Ljubic to the Assembly session, deputy Muharem Cero 
said. 
  Rasim Kadic emphasized that the deputies throughout the 
republic must receive an invitation to resume contacts with the 
representatives of the HDZ and proposed the holding of a joint 
meeting prior to the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly session.

  [Excerpt] Zagreb, March 17 (AFP) -- Croatian authorities 
and officials of breakaway Serb-held Krajina could sign a 
ceasefire agreement when they meet next Tuesday [22 March], 
Russian envoy Vitaly Churkin said here Wednesday. 
  Churkin announced the meeting, to be held in the Russian 
embassy here, after talks Wednesday with officials from Krajina. 
  The first task was to get them to sign a watertight 
ceasefire 
agreement to make sure there was no more fighting around 
Serb-controlled zones under United Nations protection, he said. 
  Such an agreement already existed, but the two sides had for 
"emotional and political reasons" refused to sign it so far, 
Churkin said. 
  "People cannot make that final step towards peace, they are 
so used to war that this final step is psychologically 
difficult." 
  He told reporters that the announcement had been previously 
worked out with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman "so it did not 
come as a surprise to him." 
  He said his talks with both sides had proved difficult as 
"mistrust is great on both sides." 
  "There are certainly some on both sides who believe that the 
only way to go is by military means, which I happen to believe 
very strongly is a catastrophe," he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prague, March 13 (CTK) -- Complete parliamentary 
control over the every move of the Czech intelligence services 
is not possible, Chairman of Parliament Milan Uhde said on 
Television Nova today. If members of parliament were informed 
of every plan and process of Czech intelligence and 
counter-intelligence there would immediately be leaks to the 
media, he warned. 
  Parliament could only control the Czech services' activites 
by appointing reliable individuals to top posts, he said. 
Members of the parliamentary inspection commission would be 
able, he said, to look at the files of closed cases but not 
cases currently in operation. 
  He said recent German press reports that many secret agents 
of former communist countries, including the Czech Republic, are 
still operating in Germany were "slightly coloured" by the fact 
that German agents who used to operate in communist states are 
now afraid of losing their jobs. 
  Information CTK obtained from deputies close to the 
Parliamentary Defence and Security Committee suggests, however, 
that parliament can only inspect the activities of one of the 
four Czech intelligence services, the Security Information 
Service (BIS) which conducts counter-intelligence within the 
Czech Republic. The other services engage in espionage abroad, 
military intelligence and military counter-intelligence. 
  Speaking on the same television programme he said that the 
state should contribute substantially to the funding of 
political parties. If it did not do so, there was a risk the 
financing might become criminal. 
  He explained the delays in passing the law on party funding 
as being due to certain concrete questions remaining unsolved, 
for example: who should control the funding and whether parties 
should be obliged to declare the sources of other funds, like 
donations.

  [Text] Budapest, 11 March (MTI) -- In a statement sent to 
MTI today, the Hungarian Foreign Ministry's Press Department 
said: 
  "An article in the 1/1994 issue of PARLAMENTNY KURIER, the 
official periodical of the Slovak National Council, comments on 
Hungary's coat of arms, a national symbol of this country, in a 
manner insulting to the sovereignty of Hungary." The article 
accuses Hungary's coat-of-arms of unlawfully depicting three 
hills and a double cross, which it claims are Slovak symbols. 
  The statement says, "On March 11 the head of the Foreign 
Ministry's relevant regional department summoned the Slovak 
charge d'affaires and presented him with a verbal note. 
  "In the note, the Foreign Ministry recalled that several 
European states, as well as others, use among their national and 
state symbols ones that are identical or similar. This is 
regarded as a symbol of connection between the various peoples. 
The Hungarian Foreign Ministry considers it contrary to 
traditional friendship between the two peoples that the national 
symbols are made a matter of debate between the two countries. 
The Foreign Ministry has asked the Slovak side to adopt a 
formal position on the issue."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza </F>
Jeszenszky by Adrian Bridge: "Hungary Looks to Both East and 
West"; date not given] 
  [Text] Budapest -- The Hungarian Foreign Minister, Geza 
Jeszenszky, has expressed optimism that his country will be able 
to meet the requirements for joining the European Union [EU] by 
the year 2000. 
  In an interview with the Independent, Mr Jeszenszky said 
that 
membership of the union remained the central aim of the ruling 
Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), which has headed the 
government since 1990. 
  But with general elections less than two months away, the 
minister warned that victory for the Socialists -- successors to 
the former Communist Party -- could lead to a weakening of 
Hungary's drive to realign itself with the West, and even to a 
revival of the more traditional ties with Moscow. 
  "When one considers the backgrounds of the people in the 
(Socialist) Party, one has to have misgivings," said Mr 
Jeszenszky. "Many of them spent years studying in Russia and 
know the Russian mentality better than the Western one. If a 
situation arose in which the position of Central Europe was 
called into question, I am not sure they would stand up for 
continued commitment to the West." 
  In their official election programme, the Socialists, 
currently heading the field in opinion polls, pledge firm 
support for Hungary's application to join the EU, which is due 
for formal submission next month. The party, which reformed and 
renamed itself in 1989, also promises to maintain the process of 
economic reform. On Nato, it is less forthright. While not 
opposed to membership, the party believes there should be no 
rush to join and that the issue should be put to a referendum. 
  "Unfortunately, too many (Socialists) have trained for too 
long to view Western countries as enemies," said Mr Jeszenszky. 
Although Hungary's attempts to join the EU and Nato are 
unlikely to form the main issues in the electoral campaign, the 
Socialists may be able to tap an undercurrent of disillusionment 
towards the West which has been growing since the anti-Communist 
revolutions of 1989. 
  That disillusionment, born from the reluctance of Western 
institutions to roll out the red carpet to their newly liberated 
East European cousins, has been fuelled by what are perceived to 
have been the West's confusing and inadequate policies in the 
former Yugoslavia. 
  In Hungary, which claims to have sustained direct losses of 
more than US$1.5bn (1bn pounds) as a result of the imposition of 
sanctions against Serbia, criticism of the government's 
pro-Western stance has grown. Indeed, instead of kow-towing to 
Brussels and Washington, some even suggest that the country's 
true interests would be better served by re-kindling ties with 
Russia and neighbouring Serbia. 
  That is not, however, the majority view, with most 
Hungarians 
still convinced that their future lies within the EC and Nato. 
"We have lost our illusions over the past four years, but we 
still have our hopes," said Mr Jeszenszky's spokesman, Janos 
Herman. "We have discovered that not everything under the sun 
is perfect. But there are some things that are less imperfect 
than others."

  [Text] Budapest, 15 Mar (MTI) -- Thousands attended a 
commemoration on Tuesday in the National Museum gardens, a 
historic venue of the 1848-49 Hungarian revolution and freedom 
fight. Members of government and Parliament were present, plus 
Budapest diplomats. A speech by Prime Minister Peter Boross 
recalled turning points of Hungarian history from the conquest 
to the present. 
  He cited the historical importance of the 1848-49 revolution 
and freedom fight, the ideas of March 15, freedom, national 
independence, and social modernisation. 
  Boross said distorted, alien ideas ruled the Hungarian 
people 
after World War Two. "The message of the March flame was there 
on October 23, 1956, when people fought for indestructible 
Hungarian freedom and overthrew a distorted system of ideas." 
  "This is the fourth year that we have celebrated March 15 
freely, and the third year that there are no foreign soldiers in 
the country," the prime minister continued. Boross said the 
tough years of change and recent traumas all point in one 
direction, that of the March ideal: To survive, and to make the 
life of the nation better, more secure and free. 
  "We have not solved everything, there is unfinished 
business, 
unsolved problems, but we are on the way, as we are fulfilling 
the order to survive and to prosper. Let us promise not to 
struggle with our daily problems today or engage in politics, 
but to bow our heads to the great figures of the nation. The 
spirit of March should refresh our public life, should give 
faith and courage so that we can cover the road ahead of us," 
the prime minister said.

  [Text] Budapest, 15 March (MTI) -- The Hungarian Justice 
and Life Party, the Hungarian Way groups, and several other 
organizations held a joint ceremony to mark March 15, the 
anniversary of the outbreak of the 1848-49 Hungarian revolution, 
on Tuesday [15 March]. Several thousand people attended the 
ceremony, held in Szabadsag Square, in front of the Hungarian 
Television building. 
  The co-chairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party, 
Istvan Csurka, said the Hungarian nation is in extreme peril, 
threatened by internal deterioration, with the front line drawn 
between the Hungarian national character and a foreign national 
character. Csurka said the former system is ideologically still 
in place, and there is major financial backing for attacks on 
the national character. 
  "We want a free Hungarian press, in which left-wing lies 
presented as truth are eliminated, and from which the 
falsification of history and anti-Hungarian attitudes are 
banished," Csurka said.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 12 -- Opening the congress of the 
National Self-Defence (Samoobrona) Front (FNS) party here 
Saturday, its leader, Janusz Bryczkowski, said the party was 
ideologically close to the slogans promoted by Vladimir 
Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party in Russia. The Russian 
politician attended the congress as a guest. 
  Bryczkowski said that a strong Russia was the guarantor of 
the existing European borders. "No one should think that Polish 
borders can be guaranteed by NATO," Bryczkowski added. 
  Zhirinovsky, whom Bryczkowski described as "a great friend 
of 
Poland," told the congress that Russia had no territorial 
pretentions and its army would never move on the West. He also 
added that Russia would not allow Western armies to come through 
Poland to the east. The Russian guest stressed the need for 
pan-Slavic solidarity in which Russia and Poland had great roles 
to play. 
  At a press conference held before the congress debates, 
Zhirinovsky claimed that Russia was already changing its 
policies in tune with his party's programme. He explained that 
President Yeltsin had to come to respect the outcome of the 
parliamentary elections in which the Liberal Democrats won 25 
percent of the vote. Zhirinovsky admitted he hoped for the 
removal of Andrey Kozyrev and Sergey Shahrai from the Russian 
Government by next June. 
  Asked about his earlier pronouncements which questioned the 
existing Polish borders, the Russian politician said that the 
best possible border between Poland, Russia and Germany is the 
sea border on the Baltic.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 11--A several dozen strong group of 
Solidarity trade union members left the Labour Ministry building 
on Friday at about 2100 hrs after waiting in vain 10 hours for 
Labour Minister Leszek Miller. Representatives of five 
Solidarity regions have come to Labour Ministry to fix the date 
for talks between the government and the Solidarity national 
commission. 
  According to the unionists their arrival to the Labour 
Ministry resulted from Thursday's televised speech of Minister 
Miller in which he invited Solidarity for talks. 
  In an adopted statement, the unionists said that the fact 
that Minister Miller failed to show up means that the 
"government's declaration concerning its readiness to dialogue 
with Solidarity is simply a sheer lie. That is why the 
government side is taking on responsibility for what would 
happen in the country," the statement reads. 
  When the unionists were about to leave, Solidarity leader 
Marian Krzaklewski appeared and said that the government's 
actual readiness to negotiate had been checked. 
  He added that the protest action headquarters is to meet in 
Katowice on March 13 to discuss possible changes to the protest 
action schedule for next week. He announced that the protest 
action can escalate if the government does not start talks with 
the union. 
  The unionists were received by Deputy Labour Minister 
Andrzej 
Baczkowski who said that the government does not see any 
justification for conducting separate talks only with 
Solidarity. He explained that Minister Miller invited Solidarity 
leader Marian Krzaklewski to talks on social guarantees and work 
within the tri- partite commission for socio-economic issues. 
  On Friday minister Miller was paying a visit to Slupsk where 
he met with representatives of local governments and the 
unemployed. 
  The unionists represented extracting, metallurgy, power and 
arms industries.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 15 -- Secretary General of the Council 
of Europe Catherine Lalumiere on Tuesday told at a press 
conference that the talks she conducted in Warsaw assured her 
that the government formed after the September 1993 elections 
has not changed Poland's foreign policy. 
  She expresseed satisfaction at the declaration of the Polish 
foreign minister that Poland will actively participate in the 
work of the Council of Europe and will continue economic, legal 
and democratic reforms in the country. She stated that according 
to the Council of Europe the line of the Polish foreign policy 
that had been initiated in 1990 is good. 
  Earlier on Tuesday, the second and final day of her official 
visit to Poland, Ms Lalumiere was received by President Lech 
Walesa. She told newsmen after the meeting that the president 
pointed to the unstable situation in central and eastern Europe, 
especially in Russia and Ukraine. According to her, Walesa 
stressed that the West did not make enough efforts to help these 
countries in overcoming their internal problems. 
  Lalumiere's talks with President Walesa, Foreign Minister 
Andrzej Olechowski, the speakers of the Sejm and Senate and the 
Sejm Committee of Foreign Affairs were dominated by the issue of 
admitting the states that had emerged after the collapse of the 
Soviet Union to the Council of Europe. 
  The sides agreed that these countries should become members 
of the Council of Europe if they pledge to respect the 
democratic principles, pluralism, human rights and fundamental 
rights of citizens. 
  The Polish interlocutors of Ms. Lalumiere, above all the 
president, pointed out that the situation in postcommunist 
central and eastern Europe is serious and causes concern. They 
stressed the necessity of a strong support by the West for 
reforms carried out in the postcommunist states, above all in 
Russia and Ukraine. 
  Ms. Lalumiere's talks with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy covered 
social charter of the Council of Europe. Both agreed that this 
was a boosting tool that contained some European standards, 
useful particularly to countries in the period of transition. 
  During the meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Aleksander 
Luczak the two focused on joint initiatives to support training 
of staff for European institutions. Luczak said a centre of 
civic education could be established in Warsaw to promote 
tolerance, knowledge of human rights and European integration. 
  Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Wlodzimierz 
Cimoszewicz and Lalumiere discussed the question of Poland's 
access to further conventions of European Council. Poland 
ratified only over 20 out of 149 conventions of the Council of 
Europe, she noted. 
  In her lecture delivered at Warsaw University, Lalumiere 
called on NATO and the European Union to undertake actions to 
ensure military and economic security to countries of central 
and eastern Europe.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/3/1994 -- The visit of the 
Romanian premier, Nicolae Vacaroiu, in the counties of Mures, 
Harghita and Covasna is welcome, this being an opportunity for 
him to know first hand the problems of the inhabitants of these 
counties, Greater Romania Party's (PRM) leader Corneliu Vadim 
Tudor told the press at his weekly news conference. 
  Tudor said that in certain places in Transylvania leaflets 
printed in Hungary are reported to be circulating, threatening 
PRM leaders and the Hungarians who live in harmony with the 
Romanians. In his opinion, once the conflicts in former 
Yugoslavia are over, "international professionals" are trying to 
shift the testing arena to Romania. 
  PRM president voiced his satisfaction for the recent 
government reshuffle, which he termed as a response full of 
"responsibility" to the alarm signals given by his party. 
  Without assuming the "merit" for the replacement of the 
former Minister of Defence Nicolae Spiroiu, Tudor qualified his 
removal as "a consequence of his own mistakes," and the reaction 
of the "monarchist" opposition as a proof that Nicolae Spiroiu 
"was an important part in the political machinations" that wish 
the coming of former King Mihai the First to Romania.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 15/3/1994 -- Adrian Nastase, 
executive chairman of the ruling Party of Social Democracy 
[PDSR] "has disclosed" at a March 15 press conference that his 
party was willing to negotiate with both left and right, with a 
view to promote the general interests of the country. Adrian 
Nastase said that the difficult economic and political problems 
of 1994 could be solved only by applying the arithmetic resulted 
from the 1992 polls. In his opinion it is not a certain 
composition of the executive that is essential at present, but a 
governing programme based on the provisions of the memorandum 
with the IMF, and the speeding of the reform. According to the 
ruling party that can be achieved, added Nastase, by the 
creation of a group of experts made up of representatives of all 
parliamentary parties, apt to attract the interest of all 
political parties. 
  Referring to snap elections, Adrian Nastase said that they 
would be "disastrous" for the country.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 11 (CTK) -- "We have received 
signals from the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) that 
some of its members are willing to contemplate their 
participation in the new government," chairman of the Democratic 
Left Party (SDL) Peter Weiss said. 
  Chairman of the HZDS deputies group Tibor Cabaj commented on 
it as follows: "I doubt they are from our group because the HZDS 
leadership adopted a resolution, whereby in the case of the 
dismissal of the government we would turn into opposition." 
  Cabaj said he could not rule out that this could happen. 
These deputies should reconsider their further HZDS membership. 
It is undignified to wait for expulsion, he said. 
  It is the duty of the SDL to join the provisional 
government, 
regardless of its composition, said Weiss. But it will be, 
indeed, a temporary government because the SDL feels very 
strongly about early elections, Weiss added. 
  Anton Hrnko, a deputy for the National Democratic Club said: 
"I believe that Vladimir Meciar will keep his written promise he 
gave to his daughter that if he is dismissed for the second 
time, he will never return to politics."

  [Text] Bratislava, March 12 (CTK) -- Vladimir Meciar, the 
architect of Slovakia's independence and for three years the 
most popular Slovak politician, has become a victim of a 
"Czechoslovakist, communist and Hungarian conspiracy," the 
pro-government daily REPUBLIKA writes today, commenting on a 
no-confidence vote in Meciar's government passed by Slovak 
Parliament on Friday [11 March]. 
  Peoples' fears of "what is going to happen with us Slovaks" 
are justified, the author of the commentary and the paper's 
editor-in-chief Jan Smolec writes. Politicians who did not move 
a finger for the independent Slovakia seized power, he adds. 
  The daily outlines a pessimistic picture of Slovakia's 
future 
after the "dismissal" of the "beloved" premier. Peter Weiss, 
chairman of the opposition Democratic Left Party (SDL), "an heir 
of the communists from whom we have not heard one word of 
sincere declaration to the people will now influence the life of 
society," the paper says. It gives also the name of another 
"accomplice" in the conspiracy -- Chairman of the Christian 
Democratic Movement (KDH) Jan Carnogursky who "voted against 
Slovakia's independence." "While the Slovak Metropolitan 
Archbishop Jan Sokol was praying for independence a Christian 
politician voted against it," says REPUBLIKA, alluding to 
Carnogursky. 
  These people together with "extreme separatists" will likely 
to lead Slovakia back to "Czechoslovakist or other dangerous 
waters. But we will not surrender. The fight for Slovakia 
continues," Smolec concludes.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 12 (CTK) -- The debility of fourty 
years of communist rule is deeper rooted among some Slovak 
high-ranking political officials and the public than one could 
imagine, the independent daily SME writes today commenting on 
the events of the last two days in the Slovak Parliament. 
  "Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar made a three-day sensation 
of 
such an ordinary phenomenom as the recall of the government," 
the paper says, adding that Meciar "paid the price for 
identifying himself with Slovakia." 
  "A state cannot exist or fall with the fall of one man 
especially a person who uses deputies merely to push voting 
buttons in parliament," the paper says. 
  It the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) of which 
Meciar is chairman, refused to form a new government nothing 
will be left for President Michal Kovac than to charge the 
Democratic Left Party (SDL), the second strongest party in 
parliament, with forming a new government, the paper writes, 
contemplating possible future developments on the Slovak 
political scene. A change in the distribution of forces in 
parliament after a new government is established could lead also 
to the replacement of the parliament chairman. "It is 
unimaginable for the parliament chairman to be a member of the 
opposition and the HZDS wants to become opposition, the daily 
writes.

  [Text] Prague, March 12 (CTK) -- The HZDS Presidium 
discussed the urgent political situation in Slovakia after the 
passage of a no-confidence vote in Premier Meciar and his 
government in Parliament on Friday. The meeting was attended by 
cabinet ministers and HZDS parliamentary deputies. 
  Meciar said that the HZDS expressed dissatisfaction with the 
activity of Slovak President Michal Kovac which harmed the 
reputation of the Slovak Government and the Slovak Republic. 
The movement also expressed concern about the internal 
political situation in Slovakia and the situation among citizens 
as the situation is not stabilizing but, on the contrary, 
fragmentation of the political scene is taking place. 
  Meciar said that on Monday the whole cabinet will resign 
along with him. At the same time ministers in Meciar's cabinet 
rejected the offer by President Kovac to hold their functions 
until a new government is appointed because the president had 
insulted them in his speech when he accused them of corruption. 
"He should bear the responsibility and consequences by himself," 
Meciar said, referring to Kovac. 
  It is highly improbable that Parliament would agree on early 
elections because the opposition does not want them, Meciar 
said. He said that a fight for who would be the premier in a new 
government was currently going on and there were also problems 
with its personnel filling. "Peter Weiss, chairman of the 
Democratic Left Party (SDL), believes that he will be the 
premier but he did not notice that behind his back a coalition 
between Milan Knazko (former Slovak foreign minister and HZDS 
deputy chairman), Ludovit Cernak, former chairman of the Slovak 
National Party (SNS), and Jan Carnogursky (chairman of the 
Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), is being formed which have 
more votes that the SDL has, Meciar said. 
  Referring to the SDL Meciar said that the HZDS Presidium 
considered the SDL leadership not trustworthy and specifically 
Weiss and Milan Ftacnik who had breached all agreements. Meciar 
voiced doubt that the confidence between the HZDS and SDL could 
ever be restored. He said he had delayed his speech in 
Parliament on agreement with the SDL because before the vote on 
confidence in the government a vote on the early election date 
could have taken place. 
  During today's meeting Meciar proposed that he leave the 
post 
of the HZDS chairman given his defeat in Parliament. However 
the Presidium, in a secret ballot, unanimously confirmed him in 
the office.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 13 (CTK) -- Slovak opposition 
parties are holding talks on the composition of a new government 
today, Peter Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), 
the strongest opposition party in Slovakia, confirmed to CTK. 
The talks which according to observers concern filling 
ministerial posts in a new government are conducted secretly by 
opposition leaders. The opposition parties will meet also 
President Michal Kovac today to inform him about the outcome of 
their talks. 
  Kovac will recall the government of Premier Vladimir Meciar 
against whom the no-confidence vote was passed by parliament, on 
Monday [14 March]. 
  Meanwhile Ivan Laluha, representative of Meciar's Movement 
for a Democratic Slovak (HZDS) and chairman of the parliamentary 
foreign committee, told Slovak Television today that the HZDS 
would charge nobody else than Meciar with forming a new cabinet. 
  "If the president does not agree with Meciar that it is 
clear 
that he would be talking with other political entities about 
forming a new government," Laluha said. He said that Chairman 
of the HZDS Deputies' Group Tibor Cabaj was not entitled to 
negotiate the composition of a new government, as the media 
reported. 
  On Saturday [12 March] Kovac asked Cabaj to visit him to 
discuss the forming a new cabinet. Cabaj did not, however, 
accept the invitation citing a meeting of the HZDS Presidium 
which took place in Spisska Nova Ves, East Slovakia, also on 
Saturday. 
  Milan Zemko from the President's Office said that in spite 
of 
Meciar's statement that the HZDS will not enter a new 
government, it is a "political decency" on the part of Kovac to 
put such an offer to the largest deputies' group. 
  "Everything is under discussion, nothing is concluded," 
Stefan Harna, deputy chairman of Egyutteles (Co-Existence), a 
Hungarian minority movement in Slovakia, told Slovak Television 
after the first round of talks of the opposition parties on 
appointing a new government. 
  Asked whether the name of the future premier or other 
ministers in a new cabinet are known, Harna said that although 
"nothing definitive is known," it can be supposed that the talks 
will end tonight. He excluded the possibility of participation 
of Hungarian party representatives in a new government.

  [Text] Prague, March 14 (CTK) -- "I think Slovakia's 
prosperity is not dependent exclusively on a single politician, 
despite some his undisputable political abilities and the 
certain popularity he enjoys among citizens," Peter Weiss, 
chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), says in RUDE PRAVO 
today. 
  In an interview for the left-leaning Czech daily, Weiss is 
referring to former Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar who, along 
with the rest of his government, had to quit after the 
parliament voted no confidence on him last Friday. 
  Asked what led the SDL, then the strongest opposition party, 
to push for the removal of Meciar, Weiss stresses that it was 
not due to any personal controversy between Meciar and himself. 
"What happened in the parliament on Friday [11 March] was purely 
a rejection of his manner of rule, his way of exerting power 
based on the creation of the idea of an enemy, on the feeling of 
the exclusivity of a single movement (the Meciar-led Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS), and on his unwillingness to 
cooperate with other political subjects soberly, seriously and 
on principles of partnership. These are the methods perfectly 
mastered by Meciar, who used them to create conditions for 
strengthening HZDS's power in the state administration and 
economy. In implementing these methods, Meciar also 
considerably damaged Slovakia's good image abroad," Weiss 
emphasizes. 
  He says the main priority of the SDL is early elections. He 
dismisses speculation that through removing Meciar, the 
opposition ensured more votes for him in the planned elections. 
The present situation in Slovakia differs from that of three 
years ago, when Meciar was dismissed as premier and then gained 
38 per cent in the June 1992 elections, Weiss states. "People 
now have certain experience from the two-year HZDS rule, 
including great dissatisfaction over its economic policy," he 
explains. 
  Weiss confirms that the SDL is for maintenance of a 
"reasonable continuity" between the outgoing and new cabinets, 
mainly in key spheres such as the ministries of defense, 
interior, foreign affairs, justice, economy and finance. "The 
continuity can also be preserved by -- let us say -- by 
appointing present state secretaries, who well know the 
situation in the sphere controlled by relevant ministries, as 
ministers...so that they do not have to start from scratch in 
acquainting themselves with the work of the ministry," Weiss 
says. 
  He notes that Roman Kovac, the former deputy premier 
expelled 
from the HZDS in February as the co-founder of the HZDS faction 
the Alternative of Political Realism, was considered by the 
opposition as the future Slovak premier a month ago "under 
certain circumstances. However, these circumstances have 
changed. It is necessary to continue negotiations," Weiss 
states. He says that the SDL is ready to present its own 
candidate for the presidential post "if developments necessitate 
it". 
  Weiss also comments on Meciar's efforts to re-gain a 
majority 
in the 150-seat parliament. He points out that the referendum 
on early elections and the removal from the parliament of the 
deputies who quit their parties, "lacks logic: if the 
referendum sets June as the date of early elections (as 
requested by Meciar) and also agrees with stripping the 
defectors of their deputy mandates, the early elections will 
take place and there will be no need to expel anybody from the 
parliament. However, [Meciar's] political game would probably 
aim at persuading citizens that it is only necessary to oust the 
disobedient deputies from the parliament, without calling early 
elections," Weiss says. He adds that if Meciar succeeds, he 
will re-gain a majority in the parliament and "probably also 
solve the conflict between himself and President (Michal 
Kovac)". Moreover, the SDL finds the retroactive effect of the 
Meciar- considered provision that the deputies who quit their 
parties have to leave the parliament incompatible with the law. 
  The economic experts of the opposition agreed that 
immediately after its inauguration, the new government would 
push for the amendment of the law on the state budget for 1994. 
Another goal of the opposition is "depolitisation of the 
privatization process and its oversight. However, not by a 
single movement as it has been practiced so far," Weiss says in 
RUDE PRAVO.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 14 (CTK) -- Outgoing Slovak Prime 
Minister Vladimir Meciar told journalists today that he had 
received two letters from President Michal Kovac. In the first 
one Kovac informed him of his dismissal and in the second one 
asked him as chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS), the strongest political party, to name a HZDS 
representative to form a new cabinet. Meciar said that the HZDS 
would not participate in any government and went into opposition. 
  The Slovak Government ended its activity at its meeting 
today, Meciar said. A vote of no-confidence in his government 
was passed by parliament on Friday. He said the government 
unanimously voted to end its activity, as according to the 
constitution the prime minister's resignation forces the 
government to resign. 
  According to the resolution adopted at the last government 
meeting, none of Meciar's cabinet will accept the president's 
offer to stay in office until a new cabinet is appointed. The 
government decided to recall all its state secretaries and heads 
of administration in all fields.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 14 (CTK) -- Outgoing Slovak Prime 
Minister Vladimir Meciar told journalists on Monday [14 March] 
that as soon as a new Slovak Government was formed, President 
Michal Kovac should fulfill his moral duty and resign. Meciar 
confirmed that the whole government and he himself were 
resigning from their posts. 
  At a midday press conference Meciar announced he had 
received 
a letter from Kovac calling on him to resign. The parliament 
passed a vote of no-confidence in Meciar and his government on 
Friday [11 March]. 
  Meciar said Kovac was likely to persuade some government 
members to keep their posts, but added that they were bound by 
the resolution passed by the government at its last meeting this 
morning. According to the resolution, no member of Meciar's 
government will accept Kovac's offer to stay in office until a 
new cabinet is appointed. 
  Meciar said the president should be not only a 
constitutional 
but also a moral authority. A president who tells lies to the 
whole world saying that a government fighting corruption is 
itself corrupted must either prove this or leave, he added. By 
his speech in parliament on Wednesday [9 March], Kovac "has 
dishonored the HZDS" and must apologize for it. The HZDS is the 
abbreviation for Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, 
the strongest political entity in Slovakia. 
  Meciar claimed that Kovac's letter dismissing him had been 
delivered to the Government Office before Kovac had received the 
parliament's resolution on the no-confidence vote in the 
government. "He could have been decent enough to wait for the 
mentioned resolution... culture has never been a strong feature 
of his," Meciar said. 
  He said that as a parliamentary deputy he reserved the right 
to explain certain aspects of the president's conduct which he 
had not mentioned as yet. Meciar said that he would justify on 
the parliamentary soil the view that the president's figure was 
"tragic for Slovakia's history." 
  In case the HZDS wins the planned early elections or regular 
1996 elections, Meciar is ready to be sworn in by the president 
under the condition that he would resign afterwards, he said. 
  "But he should resign earlier, it is his moral duty. No 
other constitutional official has breached the constitutional 
law so vulgarly as Michal Kovac," Meciar said. 
  He pointed out that Kovac had met with the chairmen of 
political parties, while the HZDS was represented by the 
chairman of the parliamentary group. "This offends the movement 
as a whole," Meciar said.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 14 (CTK) -- Slovak President 
Michal Kovac today dismissed Vladimir Meciar in writing from the 
posts of premier, chairman of the Defense Council and director 
of the Privatization Ministry, after a vote of no-confidence in 
Meciar was passed by parliament on March 11. 
  The outgoing prime minister announced this himself, saying 
that as of 11:00 today his government was ending its activity, 
resigning and together with the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS, of which Meciar is chairman) was moving into 
opposition as a "shadow cabinet." 
  At the same time, Meciar declined Kovac's formal offer that 
the HZDS, as the strongest political movement in parliament, 
establish a new cabinet. 
  "The last meeting has taken place of a government which 
emerged from democratic elections as the will of the people and 
which today has ended its activity," Meciar said after midday at 
a press conference. 
  He said that none of the government members accepted Kovac's 
proposal that they temporarily manage their ministry, adding 
that this was not a political gesture, but a question of the 
Constitution, since temporary management of ministries would 
only be possible if the government had formally handed in its 
resignation. 
  Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak had formally become an 
HZDS 
member on March 12 "in protest," Meciar said. (Andrejcak used 
to be an independent deputy.) 
  Meciar said all state secretaries and leaders of offices 
would be dismissed by March 18. "There will be one week for the 
other parties to propose new candidates to the president," he 
said. 
  "This was a government of the founders of the state... if we 
did not have time to finish everything that we had planned to do 
in four years, that does not matter. We will ask the citizens 
if they want us again," the ex-prime minister for a second time 
announced. Meciar was ousted for the first time three years ago. 
  "In the interest of the state, we shall try to return 
again," 
added Meciar, counting on victory for the HZDS either in early 
election or in regular elections, which are to be held in 1996. 
  Meciar also expressed doubt in the opposition's willingness 
to hold early elections and its ability to create a majority 
government. "The result (of the recent events) is a change of 
people, and not support for a new government. It will be a 
minority one again, and even more than before. 
Congratulations," he added. 
  Clarifying this, he said that in the 150-member parliament 
56 
HZDS deputies and nine deputies of its coalition partner, the 
Slovak National Party (SNS) would go into opposition. 
Furthermore, he said, "nobody wanted" the 14 Hungarian deputies 
in a government coalition. All that had united the opposition 
before was resistance to him, and a conflict of interests now 
threatened, Meciar believed. 
  Meciar is also counting on a split in the opposition 
parties, 
above all in the strongest of them, the Democratic Left Party 
(SDL). He accused SDL leaders Peter Weiss and Milan Ftacnik of 
not respecting the agreements which had been concluded with the 
HZDS, keeping information from their own deputies and betraying 
the contents of confidential talks. He said that last year the 
SDL had received five offers to enter the government, and that 
before the vote of no-confidence the government posts had 
already been shared out: 11 for the HZDS, six for the SDL and 
one for the SNS. 
  Meciar ruled out the possibility of the HZDS giving 
parliamentary support to a constitutional bill allowing early 
elections to be held in autumn, saying that he was prepared to 
press for a referendum on the "immediate" holding of early 
elections, on the loss of mandates for deputies who had left 
their parties during the electoral term, and on the evidencing 
of money during the privatization process. "Immediate" elections 
meant a date of June 24 and 25, he said. Only if a referendum 
was unsuccessful would he be prepared to negotiate with parties, 
he said. 
  A condition for holding elections would have to be a change 
in the electoral system, which would prevent deputies "pouring" 
from one party to another. "Our conditions are as follows: To 
respect the will of 15 percent of citizens (who signed the 
petition for a referendum), to change the electoral law, to hold 
a referendum and then elections," he said. 
  "The point of a referendum is to change the constitutional 
conditions... a referendum can step outside the constitutional 
framework, because it is the most democratic," Meciar said in 
reply to doubts concerning the acceptability of questions 
concerning deputies' mandates. 
  Meciar said he saw a way out of the present political 
instability as lying in "anchoring" the results of the next 
election in parliament, perhaps introducing a presidential 
system, or in a move to a winner-take-all electoral system 
(instead of a proportional representation one) so that people 
had the opportunity of dismissing their deputies.

  [Text] Bratislava March 14 (CTK) -- "I consider my 
greatest immediate task to be the forming of a new government," 
Slovak premier designate, Jozef Moravcik, told CTK and Radio 
Free Europe this evening. 
  When asked whether he had a clear concept of the make-up of 
a 
new cabinet, Moravcik answered by saying that negotiations 
between individual parliamentary opposition parties were 
continuing. "Maybe on Tuesday [a5 March], maybe on Wednesday we 
shall know the definitive results of these talks and will be 
able to specify about the composition of the government," he 
said. 
  Moravcik was put forward as new Slovak premier by the former 
opposition parties earlier this evening. 
  He added he would like to present President Michal Kovac 
with 
a list of cabinet members to appoint on Wednesday so that 
parliament, which resumes its session on that day, could approve 
the choices. "A quick approach like that would be desirable," he 
said in view of the decision of the Meciar government to cease 
its functions as of Friday. 
  Moravcik said he would submit details of his programme to 
parliament at the subsequent session. He asserted that the new 
government would concentrate particularly on the economic field. 
  As regards the post of foreign minister, which Moravcik 
himself once held, he said he would prefer to see an experienced 
diplomat in the post. He had a definite candidate in mind, but 
denied it was Jan Lisuch, saying, "he already has been charged 
with a position abroad." 
  Moravcik, who recently quit the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS) after a fruitless attempt to alter the populist 
course fixed by party chairman and ex-premier Vladimir Meciar, 
confirmed talks were still continuing between all the 
"dissident" groups of the parties that formerly made up 
Slovakia's governing coalition -- the HZDS and the Slovak 
National Party (SNS) -- on the creation of some joint formation. 
"It will be a new political grouping, comprising three or four 
groups," he said. 
  The party should be established this month and should 
include, besides the former Alternative of Political Realism 
within the HZDS (led by Moravcik and former Vice-Premier Roman 
Kovac), also a group headed by former SNS Chairman Ludovit 
Cernak and the Alliance of Democrats, led by another one-time 
Slovak foreign minister, Milan Knazko. 
  Chairman of what was the strongest opposition party, the 
Democratic Left Party (SDL), Peter Weiss, stressed that the 
government to be formed would be "composed for a temporary 
period" until early general elections are held, in his view in 
September or October. If parliament does not alter the law 
shortening the electoral term, a referendum will decide on early 
elections, he said. "All political parties have told President 
Kovac it will be a six-month government," he said. 
  Weiss commented on the nomination of Moravcik as new premier 
by saying the proposal received widespread support, also from 
the SDL.

  [Text] Bratislava March 14 (CTK) -- Slovak President 
Michal Kovac confirmed to journalists that he had accepted the 
proposal that former Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik become the 
new Slovak premier. Kovac said that the representatives of all 
the political parties with whom he had negotiated had been in 
favour of Jozef Moravcik becoming premier. 
  "The entrusting of Jozef Moravcik with the task of composing 
a new government is valid as of this moment," Kovac said, adding 
that the letter of appointment would follow. 
  The composition of the new government should be known on 
Wednesday [16 March], when the president wants to hand over the 
letter of appointment. At the same time, the premier's vows 
should be taken. On Wednesday evening, Kovac said, the first 
session of the new government should take place. 
  The president said he had not wanted to deal with the 
question of the individual filling of ministerial posts at 
today's talks. However, he had asked that the political parties 
acquaint him with their suggestions in time. "I would like to 
talk to each candidate personally before appointing them," he 
said. 
  Asked by CTK whether the new government would also mean a 
signal abroad that the political situation in Slovakia was 
stabilising, the president replied that he was hoping for a 
positive appraisal. He added that Moravcik's representation of 
Slovakia abroad had met with a good response. 
  "His appointment as premier indicates that the continuity of 
Slovak foreign policy has not been interrupted," Kovac added. 
  On the statements of ex-premier Vladimir Meciar and his 
calls 
for Kovac's resignation, the president said he was "sufficiently 
armoured against him (Meciar) psychologically as to be able to 
withstand his attacks. 
  "Many of the people who have been demonstrating in squares 
and calling for my resignation are not sufficiently aware of the 
country's political situation," Kovac said. "Perhaps among them 
there are some who will never be aware of it, and will always 
stand behind Mr. Meciar," he added.

  [Text] Bratislava March 15 (CTK) -- Slovak President 
Michal Kovac today officially entrusted Jozef Moravcik the task 
of conducting negotiations on the composition of a new cabinet, 
Kovac's spokesman Anton Bodis told CTK on Tuesday [15 March]. 
  On Monday [14 March], most of the former opposition 
parliamentary parties agreed to propose Moravcik, the foreign 
minister of the former cabinet of Vladimir Meciar, as the new 
Slovak premier. 
  President Kovac asked the former opposition parties to 
compose a new government after the Meciar-led Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) had not answered his question whether 
it would propose a person whom he could charge with the 
composition of the new cabinet. 
  The new cabinet of Premier Designate Moravcik is to be 
completed on Wednesday [16 March] at the latest, when the 
current parliamentary session is to resume.

  [Excerpts] Bratislava, March 15 (CTK) -- All personnel 
questions concerning the composition of a new Slovak government 
are still open, Pavol Kanis, deputy chairman of the Democratic 
Left Party (SDL), said at a press conference today. He thus 
indirectly dismissed the claim by leaders of some right-wing 
parties that the new cabinet has already been completed to 80 
percent. 
  Asked whether he himself was to take over a government seat, 
Kanis said that the negotiating parties -- originally the 
opposition which brought about the fall of the preceding cabinet 
-- had agreed not to propose their top leaders to the new 
government. "I consider myself a top party leader," he added. 
However, he admitted that he had not attended the last 
negotiations on the issue, and therefore he had no exact 
information. 
  Speculations emerged during the talks between the SDL and 
the 
Meciar-led Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), even 
before the fall of the government of Vladimir Meciar on March 11 
that Kanis could be appointed the foreign minister in a possible 
HZDS-SDL coalition. According to some sources, all parties 
involved in the current talks on the composition of the new 
cabinet, are striving to fill the post of the foreign minister 
with their people. 
  Kanis stressed that the SDL viewed the envisaged cabinet as 
"temporary." Its main task should be the preparation of the 
early elections, he added. He indicated that the SDL would 
insist on calling the early elections. [passage omitted] 
  Kanis dismissed speculation of a rift within the SDL, as 
claimed recently by Meciar. The SDL has enough experienced 
members who "have mastered political practice" and know that 
only an appropriate compromise can guarantee the success in this 
field.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 15 (CTK) -- In advance of Prime 
Minister Designate Jozef Moravcik's announcement of the 
composition of the new cabinet on Wednesday [16 March] 
speculation has been rife about who the potential candidates are. 
  One of the five candidates for the post of finance minister 
is Mikulas Dzurinda, the main economic expert of the Christian 
Democratic Movement (KDH), a source close to the Slovak Finance 
Ministry has told CTK. 
  Dzurinda is an unambiguous supporter of the market economy, 
and may meet with opposition from the left-wing parties. In 
1991-1992 he was economic deputy to the Slovak Minister of 
Transport and Communications. 
  Moravcik said on Monday that the post of foreign minister, 
another hotly contested seat, should be filled by a non-party 
"professional diplomat." CTK has learnt from a reliable source 
at the Foreign Ministry that most suitable in terms of 
experience and skills are the ambassadors Eduard Kukan (at the 
UN), Frantisek Lipka (Paris) and Jan Kubis (Geneva). Also 
"close to Moravcik," the source said, is director of the 
Administrative and Information Department of the Foreign 
Ministry Dusan Rozbora. 
  The parties negotiating the new cabinet agree Slovak foreign 
policy should be coalition and not party-directed, as it has 
been till now. Other possible contenders for the post are 
director of the foreign committee of the presidential office 
Pavel Demes, and former Czechoslovak ambassador to Vienna, Magda 
Vasaryova, now head of the Slovak Society for Foreign Policy.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 15 (CTK) -- Political 
stabilization, the proper functioning of the state 
administration and putting a stop to negative trends in the 
economy are the priorities of the next Slovak Government, 
premier-designate Jozef Moravcik said on Slovak television today. 
  Moravcik, who was yesterday entrusted by President Michal 
Kovac with the creation of a new government, said he expected 
that the new Slovak government would be made known "by Thursday 
at the latest." 
  He emphasized that the new government would have to 
concentrate on the decisive area of the economy. "In the economy 
we have to ensure that an end is put to some negative trends, 
which are not yet appearing, and to lay the foundations for the 
new government, which after the elections will be able to 
develop these foundations," Moravcik said. 
  He also indicated that his government would have to take 
several unpopular measures. "We have to introduce a realistic 
picture of Slovakia, especially of the economy. When people 
take such a picture as the reality, they will understand the 
measures which are unavoidable to ensure the development of a 
society with good prospects after the new elections," Moravcik 
said. 
  Moravcik declined to give the names of the candidates for 
the 
ministries, because talks with them were not yet over and it was 
necessary to give the president space to decide and confirm the 
nominations. "Publishing the nominations would be a form of 
pressure on the president," he said. 
  "Nothing of good quality is born easily and simply, and thus 
the composition of the government, too, will be the result of 
fairly complicated talks," Moravcik said about the course of 
negotiations between the five parties which decided the fall of 
Meciar's government. At the same time he announced that the new 
coalition had already decided on the foreign minister, but did 
not reveal his name. 
  Moravcik said that during the creation of the government the 
emphasis was being put on the expertise of its members. The 
nascent government coalition did not intend to correct the "very 
unusual" decision made by Meciar to recall all the state 
secretaries, but it did intend this week to prepare nominations 
for these posts. 
  The next premier also admitted that there would be further 
changes. "At lower stages of the state administration, too, we 
are interested in respecting expertise, and from this point of 
view we have to make some changes, of which there might be quite 
a few," he said.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 15 (CTK) -- The former Slovak 
opposition has decided on the complete composition of the new 
Slovak government, premier-designate Jozef Moravcik said this 
evening at the end of talks between representatives of the 
parties which decided the fall of Meciar's cabinet. Tomorrow 
morning Moravcik will hand President Michal Kovac a proposal for 
the composition of the new government. 
  "However, we are expecting the deciding word from President 
Kovac," Moravcik said, adding that he did not foresee any 
problems, because the composition of the government had been 
consulted with the president at intervals. 
  "Personnel changes are continuing in the ministries, the 
committees are sitting which write off property, and 
privatization (approved by Meciar's cabinet) is continuing," 
said Roman Kovac, leading representative of the Democratic Union 
of Slovakia, and formerly deputy premier in Vladimir Meciar's 
government until he (and Moravcik) resigned several weeks ago. 
  He said that this situation was "unbearable," and that when 
President Kovac appointed the new government on Wednesday [16 
March], its first interest would be to concern itself with the 
situation and carefully look into the legality of these steps. 
  At the last session of Meciar's government, privatization 
projects were approved for the Piestany spa and the prospering 
Chemosvit Svit company, and the "privatization" of pharmacies 
and other property continued, Kovac added. 
  Moravcik said that representatives of the parties which 
decided on the fall of Meciar's cabinet and established the new 
government had decided on an early election date for the end of 
September and the beginning of October. 
  If the new coalition is unable to push through new elections 
through a constitutional law, Moravcik said, it will try and 
establish an autumn date through calling a referendum by 
parliamentary decree. 
  Meciar is pressing for a June election date, which the 
hitherto opposition has rejected. Negotiations between Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) leaders and those of the 
Democratic Left Party (SDL, which has taken part in composing 
the new government) took place today but without success.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 15 (CTK) -- "People long knew 
about the tense relationship between the president and the 
premier. It was my duty to talk about it," Slovak President 
Michal Kovac said in a Slovak television debate this evening. 
  Kovac was rejecting accusations that he had damaged the 
interests of Slovakia with the speech he made in parliament last 
week which led the opposition to hold a vote of no confidence in 
Vladimir Meciar. 
  The president also defended himself against Meciar's 
subsequent attacks on him, and also expressed himself in favor 
of achieving early elections by issuing the competence to 
dissolve parliament. 
  Kovac said that in his speech on Friday, Meciar had 
"masterfully distorted" his warning against the threat of 
corruption, making it seem as if Kovac had been accusing the 
government of corruptibility. Kovac quoted from his Wednesday 
speech to make it clear that he had not made such a claim about 
the government. 
  He also rejected the ex-premier's accusation that as 
chairman 
of the former Federal Assembly he had promised cooperation to 
Croatia in arms production and arms trading. He also denied 
that he had asked Meciar to officially recognize Taiwan for a 
reward of 500 million dollars. Kovac emphasized that he had 
only informed Meciar of this offer, because he was aware that 
accepting it could mean the discontinuation of contacts with 
China. 
  Finally, Kovac said that he was not going to let the 
demonstrations outside his window get him down, and force him to 
resign.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 15 (CTK) -- The Slovak Syndicate 
of Journalists (SSN) today called for police protection for 
their members against angry crowds after two reporters were 
beaten up while covering a demonstration in Bratislava on Monday 
[14 March]. 
  "Incidents of physical violence in the last few days ranks 
Slovakia amongst countries where freedom of speech and thought 
is not guaranteed," an SSN statement obtained by CTK reads. 
  An angry mob participating in a demonstration outside the 
residence of President Michal Kovac yesterday evening beat up 
two reporters working for Radio Free Europe (RFE). One of them, 
Stefan Hrib, was taken to hospital for examination after being 
kicked to the ground and having his bag stolen. An RFE editor 
and her colleague from Slovak Radio were also attacked. The 
journalists later accused the police of refusing to help. 
  Slovak deputy Ludovit Cernak, who is taking part in the 
discussions on the formation of a new government, said he was 
"surprised by the activity of the security forces" and added 
that, judging by what had happened during the demonstration, not 
one of ministers responsible for the police would qualify for a 
seat in the new government.

  [Text] Ada, March 12 (MTI) -- Hungarian Foreign Minister 
Geza Jeszenszky, who is paying an unofficial visit to Vojvodina, 
arrived in Ada on Saturday afternoon [12 March]. He held talks 
with leaders of the Democratic Community of Vojvodina 
Hungarians, then travelled to Mol, the headquarters of the Vox 
Humana aid organization. 
  Jeszenszky is visiting Vojvodina to mark March 15, and will 
attend the ceremonies honouring the anniversary. He will also 
hold talks with Radoslav Bulajic, the first deputy of the 
federal foreign minister. 
  In a brief statement to MTI's correspondent, Jeszenszky said 
March 15 is particularly important for the Hungarians in 
Vojvodina. In 1848, there was fighting in Vojvodina during the 
Hungarian freedom fight (the area was part of Hungary at the 
time), and national conflicts, but the possibility of the 
solution was also outlined at that time. This should be sought 
today, too, from history, but much more so from the present. 
  In answer to a question on the autonomy possibility of 
Vojvodina Hungarians, Jeszenszky said that in the course of his 
meeting with the leader of the Democratic Community of Vojvodina 
Hungarians, he inquired about any developments in this matter 
since his visit to Belgrade. 
  Jeszenszky then travelled on to Subotica, where a ceremony 
will be held on Saturday evening to mark March 15.

  [Text] Prague, March 15 (CTK) -- Czech Prime Minister and 
Civic Democratic Party (ODS) Chairman Vaclav Klaus stressed 
after a ministers' meeting today the need to respect the 
independence and sovereignty of the Slovak state. 
  Asked how he assessed the recent developments there, he 
answered that he might have his own personal opinion on the 
personalities of foreign politicians, but that it was forbidden 
for him to pass any sort of judgment of this type. "Let us 
fully respect our Slovak partner, the Slovak Government, and let 
us negotiate with it in the same correct way as we have done so 
far," he said. 
  The Christian Democratic Party-Czechoslovak People's Party 
(KDU-CSL) deems it positive that a fast decision has been made 
on who is to put together the new government, party spokesman 
Jaroslav Orel told CTK. 
  "If the whole government is appointed just as fast, it is a 
good certificate for the hitherto opposition, since it certifies 
to their responsibility for Slovakia's fate," he said. 
  Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) Ivan Pilip 
said he considered the very fact that Meciar had been removed a 
step in a democratic direction. However, Pilip said, he was 
afraid that this change had come at a time when Meciar was still 
very strong and the alternative to his government had as yet no 
clear profile. "Mr. Moravcik is known for being a restrained 
politician, and this could contribute to the stabilization of 
the situation in Slovakia, Pilip said. 
  A spokesman for the fourth coalition party, the Civic 
Democratic Alliance (ODA) said that the party would give CTK a 
statement after the party's political council finished its 
meeting this evening. 
  Of the Czech opposition parties, the Czech Social Democratic 
Party (CSSD) and the Free Democrats (SD) welcome the entrusting 
of Josef Moravcik with the composition of the new Slovak 
government. The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), 
the Left Bloc (LB) and the Liberal National Social Party (LSNS), 
however, expressed fears concerning the further political 
development in the country. 
  CSSD Chairman Milos Zeman called Moravcik a very capable 
politician, while SD Chairman Jiri Dienstbier said he was one of 
the most reasonable and responsible Slovak politicians. "I hope 
he manages to put together a government which gains authority 
through an objective approach and is actively against demagogy 
and extremism of all kinds," Dienstbier told CTK. 
  The LSNS fears that ex-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's 
departure to the opposition and the fact that the present 
opposition is, as the LSNS sees it, little prepared, could cause 
a power swing to the left and Meciar's return to power for a 
third time, LSNS chairman Pavel Hirs said at a press conference 
today. 
  He said that the LSNS believed a government of experts, who 
would prepare early elections, would be a reasonable solution to 
the present situation in Slovakia. 
  KSCM press spokeswoman Vera Zezulkova said that Moravcik 
would, in the best of cases, only be able to rely on a very weak 
majority and a heterogeneous bloc of political forces. This 
situation reflected not only the character of the present 
governing classes in Slovakia but also the inner weakness of 
"post-communist" capitalism and its inability to fulfill basic 
social functions. "From this point of view we do not see a great 
abyss of difference between development in the Czech and Slovak 
republics," she said. 
  LB Chairman Jaroslav Ortman also saw the basic problem of 
the 
newly-forming coalition as lying in its heterogeneity.

  [Text] Prague, March 11 (CTK) -- The General Staff of the 
Czechoslovak Army never considered any attack against Slovakia, 
General Karel Pezl, former chief of the General Staff, told CTK 
today. The outgoing Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar accused the 
army of the former Czechoslovak Republic of preparing an attack 
on Slovakia. 
  "During a session of the federal army General Staff I asked 
Pezl whether he could give me a pledge that the staff officers 
were not preparing a military attack plan on Slovakia. He 
sweated something terrible and said he could not," Meciar 
reported. 
  According to Pezl, Meciar's question was different: "Mr. 
General, can you give me a pledge that no officer of the General 
Staff has prepared an attack against Slovakia, even at home?" 
  Pezl said he had replied that the General Staff could give 
the pledge that it was not preparing, planning or considering 
it. He did not give a pledge for the individual officers. "I 
cannot know who is preparing what at home," he added. 
  To the question of whether or not he had really sweated 
after 
Meciar's question, Pezl replied that he did not know how another 
person could tell if someone was sweating or not. "I was 
surprised and shocked because no chief of the General Staff had 
ever been asked such an absurd question before," Pezl said. 
  Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus dissociated himself categorically 
from the alleged talks with Meciar on the issue denying them 
totally. He rejected the idea of a military attack against 
Slovakia as absurd.

  [Text] Prague, March 14 (CTK) -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
the leader of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party, will definitely 
visit the Czech Republic this year, although the date and agenda 
of his visit have yet to be discussed, Jan Vlk, secretary of the 
Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party 
(SPR-RSC), announced today. Vlk met with Zhirinovskiy in Warsaw 
over the weekend and said he found the Russian leader's views 
very reasonable. 
  The Republican Party, led by Chairman Miroslav Sladek, 
invited Zhirinovskiy to the Czech Republic earlier this year, 
just two days after Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus, following 
Zhirinovskiy's much publicized and controversial tour of several 
European countries, said he hoped the Russian would not come. 
  During the tour, Zhirinovskiy said the Czech Republic would 
lose Moravia and all that would be left was Prague and "a few 
breweries where the beer will turn bitter." In an interview for 
Czech Television, he predicted that in ten years young Czechs 
would be vilifying President Vaclav Havel and cleaning the boots 
of German army officers. 
  Vlk, Sladek, and Zhirinovskiy met in Warsaw to attend a 
congress of the Polish National Front, a small party with 
similar extremist views. Speaking at the congress, Vlk called 
for the creation of an international association of nationalist, 
conservative rightist parties. The Republicans also accepted an 
invitation to attend the Liberal Democrats' April 2-3 congress 
in Moscow. 
  Zhirinovskiy told the Polish party congress that Russia had 
no territorial claims and its armies would never head west, but 
at the same time he would not allow any Western armies to use 
Poland as a path to attack Russia. If he becomes president, he 
added, he would protect Russian interests by any means 
necessary, "including nuclear weapons."

  [Text] Warsaw, March 11--Leader of Russia's 
ultra-nationalistic Liberal-Democratic Party Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy arrived in Warsaw on Friday evening. Zhirinovskiy 
was welcomed by leader of the National Self-Defence (Samoobrona) 
Front Janusz Bryczkowski at the Warsaw international airport. 
  In the airport lounge Zhirinovskiy was awaited by a 
20-strong 
group of young people from the Independent Student Association 
(NZS) and the League of Republican and Academic Corporation 
Polonia. They were holding a banner with a slogan "We Do Not 
Want Fascists in Poland." A group of uniformed young people 
from the National Self-Defence Front tried to interfere. 
  When after customs clearance Zhirinovskiy was being led to a 
car, he was followed by a crowd of people, predominantly 
journalists. A brigade for the airport protection, equipped 
with batons, shields and helmets, intervened, hitting several 
journalists with batons. 
  Zhirinovskiy, invited to Poland by Janusz Bryczkowski, will 
participate in a Saturday meeting of the first congress of the 
National Self-Defence Front. 
  According to an opinion poll carried out on February 4-6 by 
the Public Opinion Polling Centre (OBOP), 53 per cent of the 
polled have heard of Zhirinovskiy and have shown interest in 
him, 34 per cent have heard about him but have not been 
interested and 13 per cent have not heard of the Russian 
politician. 
  According to 66 per cent of those who heard of Zhirinovskiy, 
representatives of the Polish cabinet and politicians should not 
establish any contact with the Russian politician.

  [Text] Prague, March 14 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav 
Havel commented on the planned visit of the leader of Russia's 
Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, as early as the 
beginning of February, Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek told 
CTK on Monday [14 March]. 
  Zhirinovskiy was invited to the Czech Republic at the 
beginning of February by the extreme right Assembly for the 
Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC), which has 8 
out of the total of 200 parliamentary seats. 
  Havel said on February 6 that "Mr. Zhirinovskiy has a 
diplomatic passport, he can come here and then it will depend on 
him what he says here and whether or not our authorities find it 
suitable to possibly expel him." 
  Zhirinovskiy announced in Warsaw on Monday that he would 
arrive on Sunday, March 20, for a two-day visit to the Czech 
Republic. 
  The Czech Foreign Ministry said on Monday it did not think 
that Zhirinovskiy's possible visit could help promote 
Czech-Russian relations. Marek Skolil, the ministry's press 
department director, told CTK the ministry learnt about 
Zhirinovskiy's intention to visit the Czech Republic from the 
media. 
  The chairman of the government coalition Christian 
Democratic 
Party (KDS), Ivan Pilip, told CTK it would be better if 
Zhirinovskiy did not visit the Czech Republic. "Political 
extremism has radiated many times and most clearly from 
Zhirinovskiy's statements, and it would not be good not to 
counter it only because he does not have real executive 
political power at the moment," Pilip said. He added that this 
could change given the current situation in Russia. 
  Otakar Vychodil (Civic Democratic Party), a member of the 
parliamentary foreign committee, told CTK that he personally did 
not think that Zhirinovskiy's visit could influence the 
political situation in the Czech Republic. 
  Miloslav Vyborny (Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak 
People's Party, KDU-CSL), chairman of the parliamentary 
constitutional-legal committee, said he was not enthusiastic 
about Zhirinovskiy's forthcoming visit. "Nevertheless, I do not 
think that we could prevent the visit in any way." 
  The opposition Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) is ready 
to call on the public to stage demonstrations to express 
disagreement with Zhirinovskiy's visit, CSSD Deputy Chairman 
Pavel Novak told CTK. He said "it is not only up to the 
government, but to all democratic political parties to use all 
possibilities of expressing their disagreement with his 
[Zhirinovskiy's] fascist views," Novak added. 
  Jaroslav Ortman, chairman of the parliamentary deputies' 
group Left Bloc (LB), told CTK that the Republicans' invitation 
to Zhirinovskiy was an expression of contempt for both the Czech 
Republic and humanism in politics. 
  The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) does not 
agree with many of Zhirinovskiy's statements which it considers 
to be extremely nationalistic, the party's spokeswoman Vera 
Zezulkova told CTK. 
  But she added that it should not be forgotten that 
Zhirinovskiy's party "has to a certain degree narrowed the 
maneuvering scope of those political groups and the economic 
lobby hidden behind them which directly promoted foreign 
interests in Russia and which wanted to treat Russia as a mere 
colony." 
  "It will be decisive for the development of our relations to 
Zhirinovskiy... whether he will respect the principles of 
equality and full sovereignty of all states and nations," 
Zezulkova said.

  [Text] Holesov, south Moravia, March 15 (CTK) -- Czech 
Interior Minister Jan Ruml said today he would take all 
necessary steps to prevent Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of 
Russia's Liberal Democratic Party, from staying in the Czech 
Republic. 
  Zhirinovskiy is expected to arrive on March 20 for a two-day 
visit. He was invited by Miroslav Sladek's Assembly for the 
Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia (SPR-RSC) earlier 
this year, two days after Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said 
he hoped the Russian leader would not come to the Czech Republic. 
  The Czech Republic has no visa requirement for Russian 
citizens, and as a member of Russia's parliament Zhirinovskiy 
may also avail himself of his diplomatic passport, so that no 
legal obstacles exist to prevent him from entering the country. 
  Nevertheless, Ruml said he would look into other 
possibilities. "In the law on foreigners' stays on Czech 
territory there is a passage I will make use of. It states that 
a visit can be denied for a year if, among other things, it is 
absolutely necessary for the state's security, the maintenance 
of public order, the protection of health, or the rights and 
freedoms of others.

  [Text] Prague, March 15 (CTK) -- Nine Communist Party 
parliamentary deputies have signed a letter drafted by their 
party and sent on Monday [14 March] to the United States 
Congress in support of a congressional initiative to lift 
America's 35-year-old blockade of Cuba. 
  In informing CTK about the letter, however, the chairman of 
the party's deputies group, Vaclav Exner, said it would have 
been better if more deputies had signed it. 
  "A number of deputies from the Social Democratic, Liberal 
Social Union and Left Bloc deputies groups have expressed their 
view that in essence they support ending the blockade of Cuba," 
Exner said. "But it bothers them to a certain extent that the 
suggestion came from our group." 
  The Congressional initiative is being led by Representative 
Charles Rangel, who is expected to present it formally this week.

after meeting with Romanian Foreign Minister Theodor Melescanu 
in Bucharest on 16 March; recorded, in Russian with 
passage-by-passage translation into Romanian] 
  [Text] As you know, Romania is our neighbor, a country 
with which we have an over 600-km common border. We have 
discussed a few theoretical problems and found several joint 
points of interest. I am referring to political, military, and 
mainly technical-military aspects, such as the training of 
cadres and methods of training cadres. We also discussed complex 
technical-military issues and ways to coordinate actions, carry 
out joint maneuvers, and ensure an exchange of experience. 
  Today I visited the educational institution of the Romanian 
Navy. There, we discussed issues regarding our bilateral 
relations and our views about issues that are of great interest 
to both sides. 
  We drafted a number of conventions regarding cooperation 
between us, between our countries, such as the accord on 
cooperation between the two military departments. We also 
broached issues regarding the concept of and our participation 
in the Partnership for Peace, which both we and Romania have 
signed, and we agreed that this is a first stage and then, we 
will have to participate in NATO, but for this new stage we will 
have to prepare new proposals. I am referring to military 
issues and the issues of our departments. 
  Thus, in general I am very pleased with this visit because 
70 
percent of the issues we broached have been solved during my 
stay here, after one and a half days, and we still have a few 
visits scheduled. Our relations are excellent. Yesterday we 
held talks with the minister of defense and today with the 
foreign minister. Yesterday we discussed economic issues of 
mutual interest with the prime minister [Nicolae Vacaroiu]. He 
will soon pay a visit to Ukraine. We also have a meeting 
scheduled with Romania's president. In the evening we will meet 
with the chief of staff [Dumitru Cioflina], with whom we will 
discuss strictly military issues.

  [Text] An agreement on military cooperation between 
Romania and Ukraine was signed today by Gheorghe Tinca, Romanian 
minister of national defense, and General Vitaliy Radeskyy, 
Ukrainian minister of national defense. 
  At a subsequent news conference, Tinca said that the treaty 
covers a large sphere of activities of cooperation in the 
military, scientific, and educational spheres. In his turn, 
General Vitaliy Radeskyy expressed the hope that good 
cooperation between the armies of the two countries can 
contribute to good cooperation in the political sphere, 
something which both Romania and Ukraine can put to their use in 
the future.

  [Text] The first round of exploratory talks between the 
Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] and the Civic Alliance 
Party [PAC] concluded a short while ago at Elisabeta Palace. 
  We agreed that both political parties ought to contribute to 
the lessening of tension in Romanian political life, not merely 
at the parliamentary but also at the local administration level. 
We also agreed to cooperate with respect to draft bill packages 
and programs, stated PDSR Deputy Chairman Liviu Maior at a short 
news conference that followed the meeting. The next round of 
talks is scheduled for 29 March. 
  PAC Deputy Chairman Nicolae Taran stated that, quote, we 
established what we could jointly do and how long it would take 
us to achieve those things. The PAC is a member of the 
Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] and therefore it cannot 
decide in the name of the CDR, but merely pledge things that it 
can achieve on its own. However, our position expressed today 
actually outlined the position of the CDR, unquote, our 
correspondent Florin Brusten reports.
