<F P=106> [Marina Roman article: "The CDR Believes That the Current </F>
Regime Is Continuing the One Installed in 1947 -- the PNTCD Has 
Decided To Suspend Negotiations With the PDSR"] 
  [Text] The dialogue with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party 
of Romania] will continue only if the complete formula of the 
Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] is accepted and only if 
the ruling party will officially invite it to the negotiating 
table. 
  "There is no reason for us to continue discussions with the 
PDSR," said Senator Ion Diaconescu. The PDSR was informed of 
this even during the meeting held with the National Peasant 
Christian Democratic Party [PNTCD]. Both the talks at Cotroceni 
and those conducted with the CDR parties were initiated by the 
other side, namely President Ion Iliescu and the PDSR. In the 
PNTCD's view the terms for continuing the dialogue are the 
participation of the entire CDR and only following an invitation 
coming from the PDSR, as it did so far. "The Convention will 
then decide whether it will participate and if the invitation is 
not sent, then no harm is done either way," Mr. Diaconescu also 
said. It seems that the PDSR executive president is concerned 
about the unity of the Convention, "he cares for it." The 
common desire and struggle to replace the current regime that 
has been in power in Romania since the 1989 revolution 
constitutes the commitment of the CDR, Mr. Diaconescu 
reiterated. The current regime is considered to be the 
continuer of the communist regime. All the parties within the 
CDR are united in this struggle and when the goal has been 
achieved, each one is to follow its own ideology and program. 
"If Mr. Nastase wants to say that the executive power is united 
-- at a time when we believed that the PDSR distanced itself 
from the viewpoints of Messrs. Funar, Vadim Tudor, or Paunescu 
-- the opposition will treat this bloc as such," the Peasant 
Party leader concluded.

<F P=106> [Speech by Petre Roman, president of the Democratic Party </F>
(National Salvation Front), PD(FSN), at the meeting of the 
PD(FSN) Steering Collegium in Bucharest on 12 March: "In Times 
of Distress Democracy Is Impossible Without a Solid National 
Consensus"] 
  [Text] I would like to remind you that last November, 
after a number of speeches I had made on the same subject, I 
stressed the idea of a national pact, which meant the opening of 
talks and a dialogue with the Social Democracy Party of Romania 
[PDSR] and the continuation of the dialogue with the Democratic 
Convention of Romania [CDR]. I initiated this action, 
proceeding from the realization that the reform was blocked and, 
what is more, the whole Romanian economy was in a state of 
blockage, something that is still being felt today by both our 
economic units and the population as a whole. This is something 
I was able to ascertain wherever I went during my visits through 
the country. From my discussions in various enterprises, I 
realized the meaning of this economic blockage, particularly for 
the citizens in the street, who are desperate since they can no 
longer cope with their daily needs. The danger of this 
situation must be obvious to everyone. We are witnessing some 
of the most aggressive manifestations of demagoguery -- an 
almost incredible thing four years after the revolution -- from 
the extremist and nationalist left-wing forces, which have begun 
to eulogize the communist regime, especially the Ceausescu 
regime, with a kind of shamelessness, which I no longer thought 
possible in our days. Their demagoguery relies on a very simple 
statement: "We gave the people work." 
  It does not really matter how we have reached such a 
situation and whether it has anything in common with the 1989 
revolution. The fact is that we are faced here with a most 
dangerous kind of demagoguery. On the one hand, there is the 
danger of public opinion moving toward their choice, which would 
be a disaster for Romanian society, and, on the other hand, 
there is the inherent need to think out what we can do to 
maintain the idea and process of reform in our country and to 
move closer to the developed and civilized world. Moreover, as I 
have said on other occasions, too, it is known that in times of 
distress and hardship -- as the period of transition is -- 
democracy is impossible without a solid national consensus. You 
will find this statement in any manual of democracy, you will 
find this statement in any serious political analysis of the 
embarrassing moments that each democracy has had to go through. 
This supplements perfectly what I have just said about the 
danger of sliding off the course toward progress and 
modernization. We must fill up the huge void inherited from the 
former regime as far as the modernization of the economy and the 
ability to be competitive in economic, technological, and 
scientific matters are concerned. I raised this matter for the 
first time last August. It was concretely embodied in the 
national pact formula, while the national pact was, in its turn, 
concretely presented in the letter you are all familiar with, 
namely the open letter sent to Romania's president, which 
specified the content of this pact in three spheres: political, 
economic, and social. This was the basis of our strategy, 
which, on the one hand, meant to convince the CDR of the 
usefulness of this idea -- an endeavor that crowned with 
success, as can be seen from the statement signed by all 
opposition parties on 14 January 1994 -- after which we launched 
this initiative toward the PDSR. The PDSR was obliged -- part 
of that party probably wanted to do it anyway -- to engage in 
negotiations with the two components of the parliamentary 
opposition. Therefore, our proposal was for tripartite 
PDSR-CDR-PD(FSN) talks. 
  Of course, the ugly and unqualifiable maneuvers of the 
current parliamentary majority, made up of the so-called 
pentagon, have never ceased to manifest themselves in this 
period. Despite these maneuvers and the fact that the PD(FSN) 
has concretely been the target of these attack, we started these 
talks. Our delegation had two rounds of meetings with the PDSR. 
As far as the CDR is concerned, things were clarified with them 
through the signing of the 14 January convention. 
  The fact is that the latest governmental reshuffle took 
place 
at a time when we were in the process of discussing ways and 
means to come to an agreement on certain matters. I honestly 
tell you that, even now, I still cannot rationally find any 
explanation for this reshuffle. If I go beyond the boundaries 
of the rational and enter the backstage corridors of the 
political game, then I might find an explanation. However, 
there is no need to speculate at a time when we want to keep the 
door of the dialogue open, since we are categorically opposed to 
the principle "the worse it is now, the better will be for us 
later." 
  This reshuffle does not ring true. It raises several 
question marks. First of all, the act as such is outside the 
spirit of the Constitution. We cannot imagine that there can be 
two categories of ministers: those who are approved by 
Parliament, and those who are not. Likewise, it is at least an 
inelegant gesture, as far as the chosen moment is concerned, 
that is exactly at the time of the start of the inter-party 
negotiations and without any kind of consultations. We are 
referring here to the replacement of General Spiroiu, thus 
giving satisfaction to some very well-known calls. 
  Spiroiu has been engaged in a very active dialogue with 
NATO. 
The first thing I am asked in my capacity as NATO rapporteur is: 
What is your opinion on this or that? Well, in this respect, I 
can either say that I have no opinion or that it is a serious 
thing. By that, I can endanger our effort to draw closer to 
this organization. Therefore, some level of concern with 
promoting our national interests should have been shown. There 
should have been a minimum effort to explain the reasons for the 
reshuffle and its meaning, the wrong things done by the replaced 
people, and the qualifications brought by the new ministers for 
making the governmental act more efficiently. The absence of 
all this proves that the state of blockage has turned into a 
true state of chaos. We have thus reached a situation whereby 
the administration acts contrary to the country's laws, by 
abusively imposing the government's arbitrary will, without it 
actually solving anything, other than further complicating the 
process of reform. This blockage is extremely dangerous for the 
overall situation in which we find ourselves.

<F P=106> [Speech by Adrian Severin, vice president of the Democratic </F>
Party(National Salvation Front), PD(FSN), at the meeting of the 
PD(FSN) Steering Collegium, in Bucharest on 12 March: "In Times 
of Distress Democracy Is Impossible Without a Solid National 
Consensus"] 
  [Excerpts] I will try to talk about what we think is the 
current main political event, namely the negotiations between 
the Democratic Party(National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)] and the 
Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. [passage omitted] We 
have to try to maintain a dialogue, but not for the sake of 
being somewhat closer to the spheres of power; with great 
responsibility, we are simply considering the current situation 
of our country and of our people. There are social segments 
that are facing such difficulties that they are no longer 
interested in political issues. We cannot come out of this 
impasse unless all responsible political forces unite. Only in 
this way will we be able to relaunch the economy and the reform 
process. [passage omitted] 
  In connection with the recent government reshuffle, I would 
like to specify that two PDSR figures, Mr. Ioan Solcanu and 
Oliviu Gherman, affirmed that this reshuffle had taken place by 
consulting the opposition. There was no such thing; these 
affirmations were made only to fool people. [passage omitted] 
This goes to show how confusing, if not immoral, the 
involvement in the dialogue by the majority formation is, and it 
also shows how difficult it is for us to discuss things under 
such conditions. Despite all this, we will continue along the 
same road. [passage omitted] 
  First I want to clarify whether the negotiations begun by 
our 
party with the PDSR representatives mean a change in our policy. 
The answer is no. [passage omitted] These negotiations are 
nothing but a resumption, under more dramatic circumstances, of 
the negotiations that we conducted in November 1992 before the 
formation of the Vacaroiu government. [passage omitted] From 
this point of view, there is no change in our policy. It is, 
however, the dramatic situation in our country that has caused 
these negotiations to resume. With what thoughts each side 
comes to these negotiations remains to be seen. We can talk 
only about ourselves. Within this context, I want to say that 
when we started negotiations with the PDSR we affirmed three 
things: "We have not come to judge you, we have not come to be 
judged -- because nothing gives you the right to be our judges 
-- and we have not come to change your views or to change our 
views -- because we are not your teachers just as you cannot be 
our teachers. [passage omitted] What we want to do is to see 
what measures we can find to seek joint objectives and the means 
of cooperation to implement them. [passage omitted] 
  Second, what are our objectives? [passage omitted] Or 
rather, what are not our objectives? It is not our objective to 
form an alliance with the PDSR. Such an alliance is ruled out. 
We are trying to achieve an alliance with genuinely 
social-democratic parties. [passage omitted] I am not talking 
of a political alliance. [passage omitted] It is our objective 
-- and we have affirmed this from the very beginning in these 
discussions -- to restructure the parliamentary majority. 
[passage omitted] 
  Third, what alternatives do we have at our disposal? The 
first one would be that this new majority generate a new 
government made up of the three reunited groups, the second 
alternative would be a government made up of the PDSR and the 
CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania] supported in parliament 
by the PD(FSN) proving that we do not want to be an obstacle in 
the formation of a better government than the current one and 
that we do not want to lay our hands, at all costs, on any of 
the portfolios. All we desire is to replace a government that 
is dangerous for the country. And the third alternative is a 
PDSR monochrome minority government supported in parliament by 
the current opposition. This third alternative -- which was 
rapidly taken up by the PDSR -- led to a number of discussions, 
controversies, and confusion in public opinion. [passage 
omitted] When we said that the third alternative would be to 
support a PDSR minority government, we did not say that this 
government was the Vacaroiu government -- against which we have 
launched four motions. [passage omitted] It goes without 
saying that we do not support this government. Not because of a 
narrow- minded position, but because in two years of governing 
it has demonstrated that this government neither knows, wants, 
nor is able to do anything for the benefit of this country. 
When I said that we will support a PDSR government, I said that 
we will support any government other than the Vacaroiu 
government, and that we will not support the government without 
conditions. In order to support such a government, we have to 
agree on three aspects. First, on a reformist government 
program; second, on isolating extremist, intolerant, chauvinist, 
and anti-Semitic forces preventing such forces from being in 
power, and third, to guarantee that commitments will be 
respected and that the democratic process in Romania will 
continue. [passage omitted] 
  Fourth, this is a question I was asked in connection with 
the formula that was launched, which was not the most fortunate: 
Namely a nonaggression Pact. [passage omitted] This is what we 
proposed. [passage omitted] From our point of view, it is much 
easier for us to respect such an accord because our attitude 
already abides by it and because we do not put pressure on local 
administration nor on the other party's members, and so forth. 
It is clear that the PDSR has to assume serious responsibility 
in this respect. This is what we discussed. 
  Another question was raised in connection with possible 
negotiations with a view to obtaining certain advantages 
regarding the famous penal files, which have been opened or are 
to be opened by the control corps of the prime minister led and 
guided by the Romania Mare Party. Here, before you, I want to 
fully deny the following hypothesis: We have by no means 
started from the idea that, by conducting such discussions, we 
will be able to close some files. On the contrary. In our 
proposal regarding the way of action, we asked the ruling party 
to take steps so that the procedures of pursuit and 
investigation will be completed, no matter the results. We 
should not bargain on such things and I personally, as our 
party's vice president and leader of this delegation, will not 
let myself be blackmailed into such negotiations. It will not 
be possible to put pressure on us by manipulating these files, 
although we know -- and you should know, too -- that for a few 
days now, further pressure has been put on the Prosecutor's to 
reactivate the operations on the respective files; thus, 
additional arguments will probably be brought to the negotiating 
table. 
  The last question is linked to reactions and prospects. 
There are several kinds of reactions to these negotiations: On 
the one hand there were reactions in support. Unfortunately, to 
all our arguments there were signs of interest only when it came 
to party interests and not national ones. [passage omitted] 
There were also negative reactions. I had the opportunity to 
read an article in a local newspaper in Prahova County, which 
was unsigned, but betrayed the "vigorous" verbs of Mr. N. Ilie 
Nica, and which accused the Democratic Party. It is clear-cut 
that Mr. N. Ilie Nica does not want the negotiations to succeed. 
We also have information that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
has instructed our ambassadors, particularly in countries with 
powerful social-democratic parties, to make it known there that 
the PD(FSN) has ceased to exist, that there is dissension in its 
leadership, that Petre Roman and other leaders will soon be 
replaced, and other such things. We have absolutely factual 
information in this respect. It is a recent action. I am sure 
that those who have desired that this government reshuffle take 
place the way it did also include people who believe that such 
methods will stop the negotiations or make us much more rigid. 
  As you see, there have been a whole number of reactions to 
these negotiations. Everybody favors reform, democracy, and 
national consensus; in actual fact, however, it seems that the 
moment opportunities emerge for all this to be built, there are 
certain people who create obstacles for such a process. 
  I want to conclude with a sentence I heard recently at the 
Council of Europe uttered by Thorvald Stoltenberg, one of the 
two negotiators on former Yugoslavia. Asked whether he was 
optimistic about the results of the negotiations, he said he 
was, but when asked what reasons there were to be optimistic, he 
said there were none. I will tell you the same thing. We do 
not have special reasons to be optimistic. Despite this, we 
will remain optimistic, no matter what obstacles may arise; we 
will prove that we stay optimistic to the very end, even risking 
being considered naive; we will prove our goodwill even if we 
risk being called foolish. We will do all we can, to the very 
end, so that no one can say that we have not made all possible 
efforts to achieve a positive result, and so that we cannot be 
blamed should these negotiations fail.

<F P=106> [Interview with Corneliu Coposu, president of the National </F>
Peasant Christian Democratic Party, by Roxana Badralexi; place 
and date not given: "It Is Not Up to the Social Democracy Party 
of Romania To Make Concessions and Mr. Iliescu Is Not Ready To 
Make Concessions"] 
  [Text] [Badralexi] Mr. Coposu, have you noted any 
compatibility between your party and the ruling party? 
  [Coposu] It is obvious that, regardless of the 
incompatibility and doctrine differences between various 
political groupings, there are also prospects of compatibility. 
Normally, each political grouping should give priority to the 
struggle for a program that can please the citizens they are 
representing. Consequently, this is a likely common target. Of 
course, one can also add that there are very many demagogic 
political groupings. However, one should generally proceed from 
the viewpoint -- incontestable, in principle -- that all parties 
want the good of the people. 
  [Badralexi] What about the Social Democracy Party of Romania 
[PDSR]? 
  [Coposu] This is a party without a program. It is being 
kept together by the temporary interests of its members. If 
these interests disappear, the party will disappear, too. 
However, even without this lack of a program, one cannot say 
that all its components are totally devoid of good intentions 
for the country. In my opinion, there are two trends within the 
PDSR. One -- which for the time being is in a majority -- is 
the radical trend, consisting of people with a crypto-communist 
mentality, who have not yet rid themselves of the Stalinist 
methods. 
  [Badralexi] Can you give some names? 
  [Coposu] I do not want to get that specific. There is a 
known group which has emerged along these lines and which does 
not make any bones about its orientation. Another group, more 
modest in numbers, which is unfortunately subject to the moral 
pressure of the radicals, has a more moderate tinge. Of course, 
there are valuable people among the moderates. Do not ask me to 
name them, because I will not become personal in this respect, 
either. 
  [Badralexi] At least tell me what you think about Messrs. 
Nastase [PDSR executive president] and [Pdsr President] Gherman: 
Are they moderate or radical? 
  [Coposu] Both are moderates, in my opinion. However, as I 
have already said, this group is unfortunately under the moral 
pressure of the others. Our older hopes about the increase of 
the moderate group's share have not come true. Therefore, if 
the situation is not worse than a few months ago, it is at least 
the same now as then. However, to answer your question, I will 
just refer to the moderate group. There would be some 
compatibility between that PDSR group and our party -- not 
necessarily programmatic, but a compatibility regarding the 
short-term common targets for this period and a pragmatic 
approach to working out a crisis program. 
  [Badralexi] Is it possible that the PDSR might see no other 
way out at this point than to leave the initiative up to the 
moderate group? If so, do you think it possible that the PNTCD 
would back a monocolor PDSR government? 
  [Coposu] In my opinion, it is not up to the PDSR or one of 
its two aforementioned groups to make concessions. This is the 
prerogative of President Ion Iliescu, who has a monopoly over 
the political power in Romania. But Mr. Iliescu is not ready to 
make any kind of concessions; he wants to keep all levers of 
power. 
  [Badralexi] What might prevent him from realizing that he 
has no other choice? 
  [Coposu] Maybe an unjustified fear of the consequences of a 
change in his absolute power. 
  [Badralexi] Consequences that might affect him personally, 
or are you talking about political consequences? 
  [Coposu] I think he is worried about his person. All the 
assurances we gave him were disregarded by him, as they are 
difficult to be believed by a man who thinks with another kind 
of logic than ours. Of course, Mr. Iliescu has not yet realized 
that our party and the opposition in general has other goals 
than witch hunting. Proof of our mentality is the fact that in 
the past four year no serious member of the PNTCD or the 
Association of Former Political Detainees [AFDP] has expressed 
any desire to take revenge against the inquisitors. 
  [Badralexi] Will the president manage to suppress this fear 
for his own security? 
  [Coposu] Unfortunately, I am pessimistic in this respect. 
My impression, which I do not want confirmed, is that the 
president is not ready to give up his monopoly of power, unless 
he is faced with the threat of popular wrath. This is something 
that should be avoided, since it might have a destabilizing 
effect and might delay the normalization of the situation in 
Romania. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, after following a 
logical line of thinking which I believe he has also followed, I 
have come to the conclusion that he is reticent about the 
usefulness of concessions that can lead to the pacification of 
Romanian society and to reconciliation. 
  [Badralexi] Let us talk now about the president's 
government. Would a possible change of premiers also change your 
position on backing a monocolor government? 
  [Coposu] No, because it is not Mr. Vacaroiu's presence 
that prevents a change of attitude. Right now, there are only 
two solutions: a change of the parliamentary majority or early 
elections. The governmental reshuffle should be done in such a 
way as to gain internal and external credibility. This cannot 
be achieved through a simple rotation of persons and an abusive 
interpretation of the constitution, by avoiding to submit the 
new cabinet members to the Parliament's vote. As long as a 
parliamentary majority that supports a credible and competent 
government cannot be put together, there is only the alternative 
of early elections. However, nobody wants them, since that 
would mean further social destabilization that could drag on for 
half a year, let alone the inherent expenses and the stagnation 
of reform that a ballot would imply. However, I would like to 
be proven wrong and a new parliamentary majority can be formed, 
a majority which will support a stable and more credible 
government than the one which has brought the country to the 
threshold of disaster. 
  [Badralexi] Would a PDSR government with an authentic 
reforming program, which enjoys the support of the parliamentary 
opposition, imply a change of the parliamentary majority? 
  [Coposu] Provided that this government is supported by that 
part of the PDSR which we have called moderate. But this is not 
the important thing. The important thing is to work out a 
crisis program supported by all responsible forces, at least for 
a certain period of time. 
  [Badralexi] How do you concretely see such a parliamentary 
change? 
  [Coposu] There are several aspects here. There is the 
possibility of a minority government which has abandoned its 
alliance with the extremist parties and is supported in all its 
democratic initiatives by the current opposition. What I have 
in mind is a government set up by the moderate wing of the PDSR 
and the representatives of the opposition, that is the 
Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] and the Democratic Party 
[PD(FSN)]. Together, these forces could put together a 
comfortable majority. There is also the possibility of an 
opposition government supported by the PDSR moderate wing. 
  [Badralexi] Would that be enough? 
  [Coposu] Yes, provided that it gets the support of a part of 
the PDSR. This hypothesis cannot be excluded. However, in 
order to achieve this, there must be a political will for change 
-- something which unfortunately does not yet exist. For the 
time being, the only valid hypothesis remains that of a minority 
government. As far as the support of the opposition is 
concerned, this could be granted not only to back the 
implementation of the IMF memorandum, which is non-negotiable, 
but also to promote a number of indispensable laws which have 
been deliberately postponed until now. Without these laws, one 
cannot even dream of a process of normalization or a beginning 
of democratization. One must prove in actual fact the desire to 
carry out the reform. The first stage of any negotiations 
should be the working out of a program. The other aspects are 
secondary and giving priority to them is proof of a lack of 
seriousness. 
  [Badralexi] If we believe that President Iliescu reaches the 
conclusion that he has no other choice than to make concessions 
and part with his pathological fear, what would be the maximum 
concessions that the PNTCD is ready to make for a possible 
cooperation with the rulers? 
  [Coposu] Our party's principles are nonnegotiable. I 
believe that one should not ask from us to make any greater 
concessions than our declared readiness to support all the 
democratic measures designed to take the country out of the 
crisis. Therefore, instead of isolating ourselves and watching 
the catastrophe unfold, we have expressed our readiness to 
partake effectively in solving the crisis. However, I do not 
consider it as a concession, since this is the moral obligation 
of all responsible political factors in Romania. 
  [Badralexi] Mr. Coposu, before we wind up this interview, I 
would like you to tell me whether a Romanian politician today 
can say what Iuliu Maniu [leader of the National Peasant Party 
between the two world wars] said at one time: "I have ruled the 
country for 20 years from the opposition." 
  [Coposu] Well, Maniu did not lie... 
  [Badralexi] We know that, but would such a thing be possible 
today? 
  [Coposu] This would be possible -- if not today, then 
tomorrow. After all, the role of the opposition in a democracy 
is equally as important as the role of the government. The 
checking done to the government's administration by a strong 
opposition is equally as important as the governing act itself. 
Maniu was right, the country can also be governed from the 
opposition. On the other hand, the absence of an opposition 
leads to either totalitarianism or catastrophe. Particularly if 
the political power gets into the hands of incompetent people 
devoid of patriotism, whose only preoccupation is to ensure the 
endless prolongation of their power of decision, which they have 
acquired at a certain point.

<F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Kover, head of the parliamentary </F>
group of the Federation of Young Democrats, by Zoltan Fekete; 
place and date not given: "The One Who Plays the Neutral Side 
Has a Good Chance of Falling"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Fekete] Everyone clearly 
rejected Viktor Orban's thoughts on a possible coalition 
including the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], the Alliance of 
Free Democrats [SZDSZ], the Federation of Young Democrats 
[Fidesz] and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]. Do 
you think that the Fidesz is looking in too many directions 
simultaneously? 
  [Kover] I do not understand what it means to look in many 
directions. 
  [Fekete] It is certain that, with the exception of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], the Fidesz is regarding all 
the other parties equally.... 
  [Kover] That is true, but this would be an unprincipled 
thing to do if one could be sure about a new government based on 
the Liberal Bloc, namely the parliamentary majority of the 
SZDSZ, the Fidesz, the Agricultural Association, and the 
Entrepreneurs' Party. Naturally, there are chances of such a 
coalition, but a professional political party has to prepare for 
all the political possibilities. 
  [Fekete] Even for a coalition with the MSZP? 
  [Kover] We have not closed down the coalition possibilities, 
either to the left or to the right. Fidesz Chairman Viktor 
Orban only said that, personally, everyone has his limits, but 
life will not stop in any party if a politician is unable to 
take certain measures without giving up his personal integrity. 
The same way, we leave the possibility open to the right, 
therefore in the direction of the coalition parties too. To the 
best of my knowledge, the SZDSZ says the same thing as we do, 
they only place emphasis on different things. This is not 
something unprincipled. We think that a political party that 
puts itself in the center cannot participate in a game on who 
cannot cooperate with whom in the future. This competition does 
not serve the long-term interests of Hungarian democracy. The 
MDF, the SZDSZ, the MSZP, and the Fidesz should compete on the 
extent of their flexibility in making sure that a realistic but 
efficient government program based on compromises will emerge in 
the next cycle. [passage omitted] 
  [Fekete] Viktor Orban, Janos Ader, and you are first- 
generation intellectuals. Who are the most certain Fidesz 
voters today: grandmothers or first-generation intellectuals 
mainly from the provinces? 
  [Kover] Opinion polls do not make such a strong 
delimitation; they can only evaluate the educational level and 
composition of a given group of voters. Therefore, although I 
am not quite sure, I can imagine that the first-generation 
intellectuals like ourselves sympathize with us. It is sure 
that the history of the Fidesz also speaks about their 
possibilities. However, all the opinion polls agree that, 
although we have voters in all the age groups, the percentage of 
potential Fidesz voters among young people is much higher than 
for other parties and, perhaps, this is only natural. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Fekete] A thirty-year-old leftist premier drifted Poland 
into a revolutionary situation in one year. Can you imagine 
that a considerable part of the adult population in Hungary will 
entrust Hungary to 30-35-year-olds, despite the leftist 
restoration condemned everywhere? Particularly in view of the 
fact that, recently, a journalist with a socialist daily said 
that they had made the Fidesz a big force, and they would also 
destroy it.... 
  [Kover] I do not feel that the press might destroy us, but 
it is obvious that an intellectual civil war is currently being 
waged in the Hungarian press. Therefore, we reacted seriously 
to this declaration and we know that this had, and still has, 
very serious consequences regarding our popularity. However, we 
think that if politics is not something omnipotent in a 
democracy, the press is definitely not something omnipotent 
either. Therefore, the Hungarian press cannot decide the 
election results in itself; this also requires the achievements 
of the various parties. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Democratic Party Chairman Vilmos Bereczki by </F>
Daniel Bodnar; place and date not given: "The Democratic Party 
-- They Would Cross the Threshold"] 
  [Text] The Democratic Party was founded on 4 September 
1993. We asked Party Chairman Vilmos Bereczki, who used to be a 
deputy for the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP], about the 
Democratic Party's foundation and its chances at the 
parliamentary elections. 
  [Bodnar] You also actively participated in the 
reorganization of the FKGP. What made you create a new party? 
  [Bereczki] I did indeed participate seriously in the 
creation of a multiparty system and in the reorganization of the 
Smallholders' Party from 1988. It was clear to me that, among 
the parties that were emerging at that time, the ideas of the 
Smallholders were closest to mine. Unfortunately, this party 
later fell apart and, thus, I had to join the group of 
independent deputies in Parliament with the intention to engage 
in politics in a smallholders' spirit until the end of the 
current parliamentary cycle. I also accepted lobbying work in 
the course of my activity as a parliamentary deputy, and I 
presented various bills under discussion to the representatives 
of various trade union organizations and asked their opinions. 
A lot of modification motions emerged from this activity. The 
need then emerged for a party that deals with the real problems 
of society at the legislative level, a party that seeks a 
consensus and, at the same time, also controls the activity of 
Parliament and of the government to a certain extent. This is 
how the Democratic Party emerged. 
  [Bodnar] How would you characterize the Democratic Party? 
  [Bereczki] The Democratic Party is a program party in the 
center, and it is trying to give an adequate political answer to 
society's challenges. Within this, in the current situation, 
given that the challenges of the left are rather strong in 
Hungary, according to its program, the Democratic Party 
represent a bourgeois leftist trend, one similar to one wing of 
the Smallholders' Party before 1945. I think that our party 
provides an alternative in the sense that those who do not want 
to vote for a party that lies more to the left than we do can 
find a proper bourgeois organization in the Democratic Party. 
  [Bodnar] On whose votes are you primarily counting? 
  [Bereczki] We have recently enjoyed some success primarily 
to the benefit of the fallen middle classes. In addition, we 
have achieved results among people working in health care and 
welfare. Among our supporters, I can also mention the 
approximately 100,000 victims of the "bio-earthwarm" affair, 
whose interests no one dared to represent in Parliament, apart 
from myself. 
  [Bodnar] What is the financial situation of your party? 
  [Bereczki] We do not receive any government support at all. 
Our opinion is that we must return to the previous practice in 
which parties did not operate using taxpayers' money. 
  [Bodnar] Which parties are close to the Democratic Party? 
  [Bereczki] Primarily those parties that think that the 
players in political life should come to a certain minimum 
agreement. There can be opposing ideas, but not conflicts. We 
do not have any reason for this because, apart from the economic 
difficulties, no other pressure is being exercised on this 
country and, therefore, it is useless to be hitting, kicking, 
and biting one another. We must find a way to settle conflicts 
in a European way and, in our view, the fate of this country 
will be primarily decided on economic and social issues, and not 
issues that express superficial political helplessness. 
  [Bodnar] What election results are you counting on? 
  [Bereczki] I think that we will reach the 5-percent 
threshold in any case. We hope that many citizens who would not 
otherwise have voted will vote because of our appeal, because 
they are interested in all the things that we have already 
succeeded in achieving. I would like to mention here that my 
proposals were taken into consideration on the issue of 
increasing pensions, and the government's media proposal is also 
very similar to my original motion. We find it promising that 
our party has thousands of members, we have more than 200 
organizations in the provinces, and a lot of people are asking 
to become members. I think that this definitely deserves 
attention in the current situation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Foreign Policy Program of the </F>
Hungarian Christian Democratic People's Party -- a Lasting and 
Just Peace"] 
  [Text] With the approach of the parliamentary elections, 
the parties are presenting their foreign policy programs, and 
our newspaper is trying to regularly inform its readers about 
these programs. 
  The national minority policy of the Christian Democratic 
People's Party [KDNP] is determined by the key words of equality 
in chances, positive discrimination, collective rights, and 
autonomy, Attila Zalan Csenger, head of the KDNP Department of 
International Relations, said in a lecture at the Hungarian 
Foreign Affairs Society on 16 March. 
  According to the program, in formulating its foreign policy 
guidelines, the KDNP aimed at supporting a lasting and just 
peace in Europe as a long-term goal, a peace based on the 
infallibility of man's dignity acquired through creation, human 
rights, and the right of all nations to self determination. 
Respect for man's basic rights is one of the starting points of 
Christian democracy, and this is the common basis of mankind's 
coexistence. The autonomy of nations is one condition for this 
and also the need to respect the personal conviction of other 
communities and the members of their own community. 
  Therefore, no country is allowed to violate the human and 
freedom rights by referring to sovereignty. The KDNP regards 
these principles as particularly important to "middle" Europe 
because this region will remain one of the biggest sources of 
danger until the end of this century and, at the same time, we 
must take into consideration the fact that the interest of 
Western Europe toward us will decrease proportionally with the 
instability of our region. 
  The security policy of the KDNP aims at avoiding wars and 
military conflicts and preserving peace. Therefore, we must try 
to fully make use of the possibilities given by the Partnership 
for Peace and the European Stability Agreement. Of course, the 
final goal of the Hungarian foreign policy continues to be the 
obtaining of full NATO membership. 
  According to the KDNP, Hungary does not have an outstanding 
border issue in the traditional sense of the word because our 
borders are determined by international agreements, but we still 
have to to a lot together with our neighbors to make our borders 
more open. The KDNP considers the stipulations included in the 
Helsinki Final Document as relevant to our borders. The 
Christian democrats are of the opinion that based on our common 
interests and values, we must become full members of the 
European Union, as the political, economic, and security corner 
stone of the new Europe. For this, we must give content to our 
association agreement and Hungary should submit its request for 
full membership as soon as possible. 
  Regarding the national minorities, the political and social 
organizations of the ethnic Hungarians living beyond our borders 
have been created and have become stronger in the past two 
years. In connection with these minorities, Hungarian foreign 
policy should strive to support their principled and political 
goals with its moral weight.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Foreign Trade Quick Balance -- </F>
Exports Decreased, Imports Increased"] 
  [Text] According to preliminary figures on foreign trade 
product turnover, imports amounted to 1,162.5 billion forints at 
current prices in 1993, some 30 percent more than the year 
before. At the same time, exports amounted to 820 billion 
forints, 3 percent less than in 1992. The balance of trade 
closed with a deficit of 342.5 billion forints or $3.6 billion. 
All this has been reported to MTI by the Central Statistical 
Office. 
  The data also show that items that do not attract payment 
obligations represented a greater than usual proportion in the 
turnover. The delivery of fighter aircraft in exchange for the 
former Soviet debt, and natural gas imports to offset the 
investment at Yamburg belonged to this group. Deliveries of 
goods in connection with products manufactured under commission 
agreements, repairs, and leasing, and material contributions to 
businesses also amounted to a significant amount. Discounting 
these, the deficit can be put at $2.3 billion. In imports, 
Germany has been overtaken by the successor states of the Soviet 
Union and it is now in second place. On comparable prices, 
imports exceeded their 1990 level by 25 percent. Within this, 
the amount of machinery imports increased more than one and a 
half times. The purchase of the Boeing passenger aircraft 
played a big role in this. The import of foodstuffs increased 
by 30 percent, and the import of materials and other consumer 
goods increased by 10 to 16 percent. 
  Exports decreased by some 10 percent. Exports decreased by 
20 percent in the first 10 months of 1993 but significantly 
increased in the last two months of the year. The decline of 
agricultural and food-processing industry exports can be gauged 
at 20 percent, while 16 percent fewer consumer goods were 
exported. The export of materials decreased by 4 percent 
compared with 1992 and the export of machinery increased by 3 
percent.

  [Text] Ljubljana, March 15 (TANJUG) -- Prime Minister Janez 
Drnovsek of Slovenia and his closest aides have denied President 
Milan Kucan's allegations that illegal para-intelligence 
services operate in the republic and termed the allegations 
"paranoid." 
  "According to the information gathered and checked so far, 
there is no evidence of the existence of illegal intelligence 
services," a statement issued on Tuesday by the so-called 
political coordination, headed by Drnovsek, said. 
  The government thus refuted Kucan's statement that 
"para-intelligence services in Slovenia keep under surveillance 
top state officials, some journalists, and other eminent 
personalities, and are ready to liquidate them." 
  The Slovene prime minister and his aides also rejected 
Kucan's statements in the more recent months about the nascent 
fascism and other negative phenomena in Slovenia, including 
mounting corruption, disqualifications of politicians and the 
like. 
  Kucan on February 16 officially informed Drnovsek and 
parliament President Herman Rigelnik that he had reliable 
information that Defence Minister Janez Jansa was plotting a 
state coup. 
  No coup has been staged, but the government has failed to 
provide any thorough explanation of the case, which is most 
likely at the core of the so-called intelligence 
misunderstandings between the president and the prime minister's 
most reliable team. 
  Slovenia has in the meantime grown more risky for foreign 
investors, according to the latest poll conducted by the 
prestigious financial review Euromoney. 
  Confidence in Slovenia's economy and economic policy is at 
its lowest since the republic seceded from the former Yugoslav 
Federation. 
  The confidence will further be eroded by a continued drop in 
the anyway inadequate foreign capital investments, and, as 
economic experts set out, the too slow implementation of reforms 
and the country's excessively high debt to a consortium of 
foreign banks.

  [Text] Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle on his way 
back from Chile -- where he attended the inauguration of 
President Eduardo Frei -- stopped over in New York last night. 
Uros Lipuscek reports about his talks at the UN Headquarters: 
  [Begin Lipuscek recording] Last night's talks between 
Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle and French Ambassador to 
the United Nations Jean-Bernard Merimee, who is presiding over 
the UN Security Council this month, and Brazilian Ambassador to 
the United Nations Raoul [name indistinct], president of the UN 
Sanctions Committee, have proven that, at the moment, there is 
no chance of the UN Security Council exempting Slovenia from the 
arms embargo. 
  The president of the UN Security Council, according to 
Peterle, showed understanding for the Slovene views and proposed 
that the Slovene diplomacy continue the debate concerning this 
problem with the leading members of the UN Security Council. 
The Slovene foreign minister said that after the signing of the 
Partnership for Peace agreement, which we recently signed with 
NATO, and a successful development of the U.S. diplomatic action 
for the solution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, some 
objections toward Slovenia have disappeared in this sense. 
  Because of all this, the Slovene foreign minister believes 
that we are on a good way to having the UN Security Council 
exempt Slovenia from the arms embargo; however, one cannot 
specify exactly when that will happen. 
  In the UN Security Council, Russia and Great Britain are 
categorically opposed to Slovenia's exemption from the embargo, 
while the French position is unclear. At a time when Russia is 
evidently still not ready to fully support the latest U.S. 
diplomatic initiative for solving the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, there seems to be absolutely no chance of 
Russia agreeing to, for example, the exemption of Slovenia from 
this embargo. Slovenia will stay on the former Yugoslavia train 
regarding weapons purchases until the superpowers have agreed on 
a uniform policy in the Balkans -- that is, when the solution 
for the Balkan crisis is in sight. That, despite the latest 
U.S. initiative, is still not in sight. That was also confirmed 
by last night's talks of Slovene Foreign Minister Peterle at UN 
Headquarters. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle at today's news 
conference spoke about the results of a recent visit to Chile 
and New York. He also replied to some of the questions 
concerning relations with Croatia. Nadja Pengov has more 
details about the news conference: 
  [Begin recording] [Pengov] The visit to Chile was of 
political and economic nature and was successful in both 
aspects, as Foreign Minister Peterle says. The partners 
displayed interest in the new markets in Europe and Slovenia can 
play an important role as a sort of service in this function. 
Great interest in the economic cooperation with Slovenia was 
also expressed by the Chilean economics minister. The talks 
that the economic part of the Slovene delegation held with the 
representatives of the association of industrialists were also 
successful. 
  The foreign minister will again visit Latin America in May. 
On that occasion he will go to Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay 
where he will sign several economic agreements. 
  The purpose of the visit and the talks at the UN 
Headquarters 
in New York was, according to the minister, to accelerate the 
lifting of the arms embargo for our country. The partner in 
talks was French Ambassador Merimee who is presiding over the UN 
Security Council this month. 
  [Peterle] Mr. Merimee was pleased with this meeting and said 
that new circumstances and new reasons have emerged for Slovenia 
to be exempt from the embargo. However, he saw no possibility 
of this happening immediately, that is to say, very soon. He 
believes that the action should be pursued further on this 
basis. Judging by these talks I believe that we are actually 
considerably closer to this solution than we used to be. 
  [Pengov] The opinion of the Brazilian ambassador to the UN, 
who is the head of the UN Sanctions Committee, was similar. He 
promised that his commission will act in a way so as not to hurt 
Slovenia. Now to other issues: 
  Bearing in mind that the second meeting of the 
Slovene-Croatian border commission was scheduled to take place 
today and that the meeting did not materialize, the foreign 
minister, when asked about the reasons, replied that the 
postponement had been proposed by the Slovene side. The reason? 
  [Peterle] There is no new basis for the work of the 
commission because the Croatian part of the expert group, that 
is to say, the geodesists, do not show any willingness to 
continue searching for a common solution for those sections of 
the state border for which consensus has not been reached yet. 
  Let me say that the fact that the Croatian Post and 
Telecommunications public enterprise without any prior warning, 
let alone consent, redirected the telephone lines of some 
subscribers on the territory which is within the land registry 
district of Secovlje does not have a positive effect, also in 
connection with the work of this commission. 
  [Pengov] What about the refugees moving out of the Slovene 
holiday homes in Istria? The owners of the holiday homes 
rejected the request to extend the deadline for their stay and 
the deadline will thus have to be observed as it was agreed.

<F P=106> [Bojan Veselinovic report on the 16 March extraordinary </F>
session of the State Chamber] 
  [Excerpts] [Begin recording] [Veselinovic] Among those 
invited to attend today's extraordinary session about the 
Slovene public debt and the relations with a consortium of 
commercial banks, parliamentary Chairman Herman Rigelnik listed 
government ministers, the director of the Agency for the 
Rehabilitation of Banks, and the director of the Slovene Social 
Accounting Service. Beside Marjan Podobnik, who spoke in the 
name of the proposers of the extraordinary session, Finance 
Minister Mitja Gaspari, National Bank of Slovenia Governor Dr. 
France Arhar, and Janko Dezelak from the Agency for 
Rehabilitation of Banks, have spoken so far. Let us take is a 
step at a time: 
  Marjan Podobnik said that it is imperative to identify all 
forms of incurring debts to find out what we are obliged to pay 
and what not. Podobnik expressed belief that our negotiations 
do not observe the provisions of the Constitutional Law, that is 
to say, they only observe it partially, while they neglect the 
division of assets, that is to say, the property of former 
Yugoslavia. Here he demanded: 
  [Podobnik] To establish the identity of each credit 
separately, namely, who incurred what credit, who spent it for 
what purpose, and who is the true debtor. 
  [Veselinovic] In the continuation, he, among other things, 
criticized the government for not sending an original contract 
about reprogramming debts from the end of the eighties to the 
deputies. Podobnik also said that he was not opposed to the 
model of financial rehabilitation of banks, but objected to 
fictitious debts and their doubling. He also said that a 
foreign auditing house has audited the Ljubljana Bank, however, 
with a remark that it could not carry out the audit in 
compliance with international standards. [passage omitted] 
  Regarding Podobnik's question about the actual height of the 
public debt first, Finance Minister Gaspari, in an expose that 
followed, said that the well-known estimate [6.5 billion German 
marks] is based on the data available by the end of 1993. 
Regarding the trade in debts, that is to say, the early purchase 
of debts, he said that the legislation in old Yugoslavia at that 
time allowed this and that this is a legitimate practice 
internationally, however, the creditors are not interested in 
this trade. The key issue for them is who has taken out the 
debt. 
  Gaspari said that the government is not opposed to 
Podobnik's 
proposal for the revision of the credit agreements that led to 
the public debt. Regarding the share of the entire old Yugoslav 
debt that Slovenia should repay to the commercial banks, Gaspari 
said that the good 16 percent that we managed to agree in the 
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund is an example 
to all other debtors, because: 
  [Gaspari] The decision of the International Monetary Fund 
that became a law in Slovenia is the first international action 
that recognized Slovenia as a successor to the former 
Yugoslavia. How? Simply, because Slovenia in that document 
split the share of the former Yugoslavia in the active and 
passive part of the balance sheet of the International Monetary 
Fund. That is why it was such an important precedent. Slovenia 
is also using it now, as it has also been approved by the 
Badinter Commission, which is not a negligible institution 
within the Geneva talks. 
  [Veselinovic] [Passage omitted] According to Gaspari, the 
views of the proposers of the session resemble the views of the 
negotiators from the rest of the former Yugoslavia. Namely, 
there is no guarantee that we will manage to get a better 
position in the succession negotiations than we enjoy now that 
we have decided to break free completely from the finance system 
of the former Yugoslavia. 
  Governor France Arhar, too, said that this decision was 
without an alternative: 
  [Arhar] What is the alternative to the negotiations with the 
creditors? The alternative to the negotiations with the 
creditors is negotiations with the debtors. 
  [Veselinov] Those of you who oppose the negotiations, Arhar 
concluded, should bear in mind that according to the credit 
agreements everything but mines and defense systems qualifies 
for confiscation. 
  Janko Dezelak, in the name of the Agency for the 
Rehabilitation of Banks, said that incrimination of the 
state-assumed debts of weak companies is an expression of the 
lack of knowledge about these problems. 
  A debate of the deputies, which will be partially closed to 
the public, is envisaged to take place after the expose by Janez 
Kopac. The parliament is currently in recess. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Since early this afternoon, the State Chamber 
has been discussing the Slovene public debt and Slovenia's 
strategy in the negotiations with a consortium of commercial 
banks at an extraordinary session convened at the request of a 
group of 25 deputies. After the initial appearance by Marjan 
Podobnik, who spoke in the name of the proposers of the session, 
and the representatives of the monetary and financial 
authorities, who called for the continuation of negotiations 
with the foreign debtors, the parliamentary debate followed. 
During the debate, the finance minister, the governor of the 
National Bank of Slovenia, and other representatives of the 
legal organs took the floor on several occasions. 
  The session was interrupted half an hour ago and it will 
continue behind closed doors. In the closed part of the session 
the deputies are to discuss the negotiating positions in the 
talks with the consortium of commercial banks, which have not 
ended yet. The last one to speak before the interruption was 
Finance Minister Gaspari, who explained that the purchase of 
debts prior to their falling due would be nonsensical, as we 
would not receive confirmation that we had actually purchased 
them. Here is a report by Vesna Burnik: 
  [Begin recording] [Burnik] [passage omitted] The debate 
proceeded in the well-known direction -- retorts and mutual 
accusations followed each other that the opposition was 
politicizing the public debt for its own purposes and 
vice-versa, that the ruling parties were pretending to be smart 
and the exclusive experts on the public debt. 
  The stumbling block was evidently the question as to when 
and 
how Slovenia actually agreed to the payment of at least a 
portion of the former SFRY debt and what the basis for it is. 
Governor Franc Arhar replied: 
  [Arhar] For the time being the declarative document, if I 
may say so, is the Constitutional Law that was passed in June. 
The law provides for the willingness and undertaking. At that 
time, everybody, the government and the parliament, whenever the 
issue surfaced and, of course, also last January, if you recall, 
when the parliament was passing the law about the membership in 
the International Monetary Fund [IMF] [sentence as heard]. When 
the IMF initiated the procedure regarding Slovenia, in 
establishing its share, it, of course, departed from the 
stipulation, from that very clear article of the Constitutional 
Law. 
  [Burnik] In the debate Marjan Poljsak demanded to know why 
Slovenia was not purchasing its portion of the debt if it really 
was so cheap at this moment. Minister Gaspari replied that the 
debts would not disappear with their purchase, because since the 
disintegration of Yugoslavia the creditors have not recognized 
the transactions, and the National Bank of Yugoslavia, of 
course, would not sign them off. The Ljubljana Bank used to do 
that, too, until the disintegration of the country. A more 
detailed debate on the topic will continue in the closed part of 
the session. [end recording]

  [Text] Zagreb, March 17 (AFP) -- British Prime Minister 
John Major arrived in the southern Croatian port of Split late 
Thursday [17 March], stopping over before a visit to the Bosnian 
capital Sarajevo on Friday, witnesses said. 
  Major, who will be making his first visit to the Bosnian 
capital, is going to Sarajevo to show his support for the 
British general commanding UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a 
spokesman for Major's office said in London. 
  Major will meet Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose in 
Sarajevo, and will also travel to the central Bosnian town of 
Vitez -- headquarters of British UN troops serving in Bosnia -- 
the spokesman said. 
  In Split, Major was expected to meet Yasushi Akashi, special 
representative of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, said 
a spokesman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR). 
  Major's visit comes a week after London announced it would 
send an 900 more soldiers to the former Yugoslavia, bringing to 
more than 3,000 the number of troops it has in the region. 
  Britain is the second largest contributor, behind France, to 
UNPROFOR in the former Yugoslavia. French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur on Sunday visited the northwestern Bosnian town 
of Bihac. 
  Major visited Bosnia previously in late 1992. 
  Earlier Thursday, a UN special envoy announced that the 
Bosnian government and Bosnian Serbs had signed an agreement to 
open roads and partially lift the two-year-old siege of Sarajevo.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandar Milosevic: "Soldiers Surpassed </F>
Politicians"] 
  [Text] The future Bosniak-Croat federation will have an 
integral defense system. That unequivocally follows on the 
agreement signed by General Rasim Delic and General Ante Roso on 
Saturday [12 March] in Split. Their signatures will, hopefully, 
finally bring an end to Muslim-Croat conflicts and disputes. It 
is significant that it took less time for the soldiers to reach 
an agreement than for the politicians who negotiated in Vienna, 
although the agreement between the two generals is in compliance 
with the work of the participants at the Vienna talks. 
  Naturally, it was easy for the soldiers to surpass the 
politicians, for they discussed a narrow segment of the broader 
mutual relations between the Bosniak Muslims and the Croats, but 
the difficult part was to disregard the series of conflicts, the 
wounded and the dead, to suppress frustration resulting from 
mutual shelling. Geostrategically speaking, the defense system 
of the Bosniak-Croat federation will definitely mean a lot for 
broad general relations in these parts. The United States was 
evidently extremely interested in reaching the agreement and 
they almost pushed General Roso and General Delic to end the 
negotiations successfully. However, it is also obvious that the 
first officers of the two military forces wisely realized that 
mutual Muslim-Croat conflicts cannot benefit either nation and 
that they directly benefit the third side. Still, considering 
the possibility of reaching a lasting political solution on the 
territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the signed agreement clearly 
says that its defense system does not aim at harming the third 
side. Simply, the two nations which will live in the federation 
are trying to define clearly the question of defense, which is 
an extremely important one for every country, especially for the 
one which rises anew from the ashes of the war. 
  There is no doubt that the United States will insist exactly 
on the military-defense plan of the future Bosniak-Croat 
federation, for in any option of the future course of events, it 
could guarantee a successful resistance to those who want to use 
weapons to impose political solutions. Of course, in order to 
implement the agreement signed by Generals Delic and Roso, it 
will be necessary to suppress the frustration and forget bad 
memories, and that will take time, but one can go forward only 
if one looks toward the future, not toward the past.

  [Text] One day after taking over the post of UN Protection 
Forces [UNPROFOR] commander in former Yugoslavia, French General 
Bertrand Guillaume de Sauville de Lapresle visited Sarajevo 
where he discussed -- as he said -- the future with Presidency 
member Ejup Ganic and General Rasim Delic. He also discussed 
the issue of Sarajevo with Interior Minister Bakir Alispahic. 
Senada Cumurovic reports. 
  [Cumurovic] After talks with General de Lapresle, Ejup Ganic 
told journalists what was discussed at the one-hour meeting. 
  [Begin Ganic recording] We informed him that the agreement, 
the cease-fire, and the disengagement of our Army and the 
Croatian Defense Council [HVO] forces is functioning in the best 
possible way, and that conditions are ripening for the Bosniaks 
and the Croats to return to their homes. The situation is 
returning to normal in that part of our state. (?At the same 
time) we pointed out the grave situation in Maglaj where the 
Serbian aggressor continues to pursue his military aims, and the 
grave situation in Bihac. Moreover, we pointed to certain 
events [words indistinct] of Serbian troops in the occupied 
territories. [end recording] 
  [Cumurovic] As far as the possible negotiations with the 
Serbian side are concerned, Dr. Ganic mentioned two conditions 
for these negotiations. 
  [Begin Ganic recording] We are ready to begin negotiations 
with the Serbian side immediately, providing that they speed up 
the withdrawal from territories where the Bosniaks were the 
majority population before the aggression and providing that the 
international community speeds up the proceedings against war 
criminals. [end recording] 
  [Cumurovic] The demilitarization of Sarajevo was also 
discussed with the UNPROFOR commander for former Yugoslavia. 
  [Begin Ganic recording] We informed the general that we 
agree to the demilitarization of Sarajevo, which is still under 
blockade, the roads are still blocked, providing that all 
citizens (?can return to their) homes. [Words indistinct] 
toward normalization, return of trust, and, of course, the 
further development of Sarajevo as an undivided city, a single 
city. [end recording] 
  [Cumurovic] General Bertrand Guillaume de Sauville de 
Lapresle, who yesterday morning took over command, came to visit 
Sarajevo today, because he believes -- as he said in his 
statement -- that there are many reasons that make it important 
for him to be here. 
  [Begin Lapresle recording in English with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] I would say that I have come here 
so that I could put my professional abilities at the disposal 
[words indistinct] and help with establishing peace in this 
country which has suffered so much, and in which I and my troops 
wish to be of service by working in accordance with political 
negotiations and aims that would satisfy all the sides in the 
conflict. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Vlastimir Mijovic: "The Moscow Tailor's Shop"] </F>
  [Text] Last week Moscow welcomed Radovan Karadzic and his 
Pale delegation with open arms. Boris Yeltsin did refrain from 
shaking hands with the man who has been accused of committing 
war crimes unheard of in this century, but the fact remains that 
official Moscow honored Karadzic in many ways that are by no 
means fitting to his real significance and status. Karadzic was 
a Moscow prima donna for three days. He was received by top 
politicians, he met with cultural and political figures, and 
reporters were always tugging at his sleeve. The Chetnik leader 
had reason enough to glow with pleasure. Namely, his dream 
about winning Russia's approval for his ideas and war aims had 
come true. 
  Although Russian officials have verbally tried to relativize 
and represent this sudden closeness with the Pale gang as 
objective mediation in the Bosnian negotiation process, even 
laymen understand that Russia is in effect taking up high 
patronage not only of the rebel Bosnian Serbs, but of the 
Orthodox part of the former Yugoslavia. The Kremlin has two 
objectives: To use the Bosnian crisis to bring their diplomacy 
back into international focus, and to reestablish the southern 
Slav part of Balkans as their interest sphere. 
  For the time being, at least as far as the first objective 
is 
concerned, Russia is doing more improvising than actually 
playing the role that it would like to play in the Bosnian 
crisis. Using a cheap trick in cooperation with its friends in 
Pale, Russia tried to win the points in the game with the NATO 
ultimatum that eventually led to the resolution of most of 
Sarajevo's war problems. The trick was repeated upon Karadzic's 
arrival in Moscow, when the Russian- Serb agreement on the 
reopening of Tuzla airport was flamboyantly declared. The 
Kremlin diplomats triumphantly ascribed the main role in the 
humanitarian unblocking of the Tuzla region to themselves, 
although they understand that the UN would have conducted the 
operation with or without the Russian-Serb approval. However, 
Russia has succeeded in something here, as in the Sarajevo case: 
It has reinforced its military presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Using the logic of following the path of the least resistance, 
the UN has accepted Russian control role of the airport, as they 
accepted a similar role for Russian soldiers in Sarajevo. 
However, the question arises as to how far it is possible to 
go. The ultimate Russian intention is to, in agreement with 
Belgrade and Pale, deploy its soldiers in all the Bosnian buffer 
zones as peace arrives in them. This is the line Karadzic 
followed in talking to the presidents of both parliamentary 
councils of Russia, whose have the final word when it comes to 
sending Russian troops out of the country. There are many 
reasons to consider the possibility that, following the trends 
of Russian policies employed so far, Bosnia will soon be divided 
and militarily neutralized like post-war Germany, with internal 
borders seemingly there inevitably to divide the country, marked 
by Russian troops on one side and Western troops on the other. 
  Russia wants to work on this arrangement hand in hand with 
Washington. The United States has so far refused the Moscow 
initiatives for returning to the principle of division of 
interest spheres. However, no one can guarantee that this will 
not eventually happen. Chiefs of diplomacy, Kozyrev and 
Christopher, are meeting later this week in Vladivistok, and 
Bosnia will be the center of attention. The Kremlin has planned 
to close the circle started with Karadzic by then directly 
contacting Croatian and Muslim leaders. 
  Haris Silajdzic accepted Moscow's invitation, but did not 
want to rush off to Moscow, which wished to see him the same 
evening that Karadzic was leaving. It seems that the head of 
the Bosnian Government also refused the honors that he was 
offered, certainly aware of the false hospitality that the 
Russians were suddenly offering. By going to Moscow, he 
acknowledges Russia's importance in the resolving of the Bosnian 
crisis. Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic is doing the 
same. He will be visiting Russia's capital at the same time as 
Silajdzic. 
  For the time being, there are no indications that Russian 
diplomacy will mediate between the three people who have been 
negotiating on Bosnia for a long time and without much success, 
but it is quite possible that some of Karadzic's important 
messages will be conveyed to Silajdzic and Granic by Kozyrev and 
Churkin. The matter primarily concerns territorial demarcations 
within Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
  To conclude, let us say that Moscow is very interested in 
what lies behind the Muslim-Croat agreement signed in 
Washington, which it both wants and fears. It wants the 
agreement because it effectively legalizes its aim, which is to 
break independent Bosnia- Herzegovina definitely into pieces, 
and fears it because the unification of the Bosnian Muslims and 
Croats with the Republic of Croatia can easily lead to another 
escalation of the war, that is, to the creation of a 
Muslim-Croat anti-Serb block! Russia is prepared for either 
case. Everyone involved in deciding on Bosnia's future should 
be aware that in either case Mother Russia will undoubtedly be a 
Serb sponsor, and is, for the sake of its protege, prepared to 
risk as much as its own international prestige.

  [Text] Nis, 18 Mar (TANJUG) -- "We will never agree to the 
Serb part of Sarajevo becoming part of a Muslim republic," 
Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the assembly of the Srpska 
republic, told Nis radio today. 
  "The Serbs simply have the right to Sarajevo and they will 
persist in this, while I hope that whoever wants peace has to 
understand this," Krajisnik said. "I know what the intentions of 
the other side are -- that the city should be mixed and as such 
become a part of the Muslim republic," Krajisnik said, adding 
that Sarajevo as a divided city enables the normal functioning 
of the Serb and Muslim parts, makes life easier for the 
population, and eliminates causes for fighting. 
  Krajisnik said that these are all the conditions [as 
received] and that after yesterday's signing of an agreement 
opening up blue roads in the Sarajevo area for the civilian 
population and humanitarian needs, all those advocating war will 
remain in a minority. 
  In conclusion, he said he hopes that complete peace in 
Sarajevo would be restored in the foreseeable future.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Mar 17 (TANJUG) -- Serbs and Moslems 
agreed on Thursday at Sarajevo Airport to open up so-called 
"blue roads" for the civilian population and humanitarian 
supplies in the area of the capital of the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina ravaged by a 23-month-old war. 
  The agreement was signed by the speaker of the Bosnian Serb 
parliament, Momcilo Krajisnik, and the deputy prime minister of 
the Moslem government in Sarajevo, Husan Muratovic, at a U.N. 
sponsored meeting. 
  The agreement provides for opening the road which links 
Sarajevo and Visoko via Vogosca, corridors linking the Sarajevo 
Serb suburbs of Lukavica and Ilidza with Sarajevo's Moslem 
suburbs of Dobrinja and Butmir as well as the bridge linking the 
suburb of Grbavica with the Moslem part of Novo Sarajevo. 
  The agreement is to take effect on March 23 and U.N. 
peace-keepers deployed in Sarajevo are to supervise its 
implementation. 
  A ceasefire has been in force between Serb and Moslem forces 
in the Sarajevo area since February 10. They have withdrawn 
their heavy weapons from an area 20 kilometers in radius around 
Sarajevo or placed them under U.N. control.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 17 (AFP) -- The Bosnian Government 
and Bosnian Serbs on Thursday signed an agreement to open roads 
and partially lift the siege of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, a 
UN special envoy announced. 
  Under the UN-sponsored agreement, Sarajevo will be linked by 
road to central Bosnia-Herzegovina via the Moslem majority town 
of Visoko (25 kilometres, or 15 miles) to the west, UN special 
envoy Sergio Vieria de Mello stated. 
  Other road corridors will be opened to link Sarajevo's 
Serb-held suburbs of Ilidza and Lukavica, on the one hand, and 
the Moslem suburbs of Butmir and Dobrinja on the other. 
  A bridge between the Serb-held Grbavica district in downtown 
Sarajevo and the rest of the capital will also be opened under 
the accord signed at Sarajevo airport. 
  The agreement, whose signing was twice postponed will take 
effect from Tuesday and concerns the resumption of civilian 
traffic for humanitarian and business purposes. 
  The text was signed in Vieira de Mello's presence by Hasan 
Muratovic, the Bosnian minister responsible for relations with 
the United Nations, and the main Bosnian Serb negotiator Momcilo 
Krajisnik. 
  When it takes effect, Sarajevo will be connected with the 
outside world, though only partially, for the first time in 
almost two years of siege by the Bosnian Serbs. 
  The UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) is responsible for 
organising and monitoring implementation of the accord. 
  Civilians wishing to use the reopened roads will be able to 
do so, by bus, to the extent of one return trip per day, after 
notifying UNPROFOR personnel 24 hours in advance. 
  The UN force would then notify competent authorities 
representing the warring parties of the lists of passengers.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 17 March carries in its 
regular 39-minute newscast the following reports about the 
fighting in the republic. 
  Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports that "Karadzic's 
terrorists are using Vis, howitzers, and tanks to shell the 
defense lines on the entire Bihac front, particularly in the 
areas of Sokolac, Orljanska, and Ribicka Glavica. After 
unsuccessful attempts at infiltrating subversion groups, the 
aggressor launched a new fierce artillery and tank attack at 
Grabez, [name indistinct], and Hasin Vrh. The defenders also 
came under fierce infantry attacks, and the fighting is still in 
progress. The members of the paramilitary formations of the 
so-called Kladusa autonomy also attacked the defenders in the 
areas on Litkovac and Pecigrad in the Cazin Municipality, which 
confirms anticipations of a fresh, joint attack on the free 
Bihac territory." 
  Amira Salibasic reports from Olovo and says that "early this 
morning, the chetniks began their attack using tanks and 
mortars, which continues this afternoon. The defense positions 
of our troops on all parts of the long Olovo front are being 
(?pounded) by howitzer and mortar shells. There are small arms' 
provocations along the entire demarcation lines." 
  The studio announcer says that "the afternoon hours in the 
7-South Operative Group operational zone are somewhat calmer," 
and introduces a report by correspondent Mirudin Aldobasic who 
says that "the reason for this are the enemy's significant 
losses in manpower and equipment. The criminal Mladic and his 
henchmen can no longer motivate their troops, so they are 
employing extremely repressive measures toward the population in 
the occupied Doboj and Teslic. They are mobilizing all Serb 
nationals up to age 55, but they are also mobilizing Muslims and 
Croats [words indistinct]. It is evident that some Serb 
nationals are avoiding mobilization, so the prisons are 
overflowing." 
  Correspondent Sead Custovic reports from the 1st Corps 
Information Service and says that "small arms' provocations were 
registered very early [this morning], and they intensified 
through the day. Brijesce was targeted from Bozica Kuca, and 
Varazdin Street was targeted from Devino Brdo, which resulted in 
the wounding of one civilian. [Words indistinct] where four 
portable rocket launcher shells exploded."

  [Text] Zagreb, March 17 (AFP) -- A French soldier killed in 
the northwestern Bosnian town of Bihac was probably the victim 
of a Moslem sniper, Matthew Nerzig, spokesman for the UN 
Protection Force [UNPROFOR], said here Thursday. 
  "No final conclusion has yet been reached, so I would point 
out that based on our preliminary investigations, it is our 
judgement that the shot that killed Corporal Stephane Dubrulle 
on March 11 did not come from the Bosnian Serb side," Nerzig 
said. 
  "In fact, we do have indications on a preliminary basis that 
the shot does seem to have come from the Bosnian Moslem side." 
  Dubrulle was the 19th French soldier killed in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina since the beginning of the war. A total of 
79 UN peacekeepers have died in the 23-month war.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Zdenko Vranjes] </F>
  [Excerpt] Following lengthy talks late last night, Croat 
and Muslim Bosniak representatives in Gornji Vakuf signed a 
final agreement on the release and exchange of POW's on an 
all-for-all principle. The implementation of the agreement is 
to start tomorrow, when the Muslim side is to release 73 
Croatian Defense Council [HVO] members from a prison in the 
eastern part of Mostar and 294 Croats from a prison in Bugojno, 
while the Croat side will simultaneously release 500 Muslim 
detainees from Rodoc near Mostar. 
  Two Muslim army helicopters that have been kept in 
Medjugorje 
are to be returned to the Muslim side tomorrow, or after they 
have been serviced. 
  The second part of the agreement envisages that isolated 
persons -- civilians -- should be relocated on Tuesday, 22 
March. This refers to several hundred Muslims from Rotilje near 
Kiseljak and Croats from the French UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] base in Catici near Kakanj. It has been agreed that 
on Tuesday the Muslim side should release six POW's from Gornji 
Vakuf, while the Croat side should release all prisoners from 
Ljubuski, Capljina, Prozor, and a heliport near Mostar. 
  It has also been agreed that Croat and Muslim 
representatives 
will meet again on Thursday [24 March], which is the deadline 
for the preparation of an exchange of all the POW's held by both 
sides in the area of central Bosnia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Pristina, 18 Mar (TANJUG) -- Ibrahim Rugova, 
president of the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo [Demokratski 
Savez Kosova, DSK], today welcomed the signing of the agreement 
on the Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  At a news conference Rugova described the agreement as the 
first step toward containing the situation and a peaceful 
resolution of the conflict, at the same time warning that 
developments will be more difficult on the ground [than in the 
negotiations] due to war wounds. 
  According to him the question is whether similar things will 
happen in other parts of the former Yugoslavia, since, as he 
said, it [former Yugoslavia] should first be reorganized 
according to ethnic and political criteria. Rugova said 
different and new ways of [implementing] the agreement could not 
be ruled out. He voiced his party's position whereby first of 
all each one [each nation] should be a master in its own home, 
and then economic and other associations will be possible. 
  The DSK president expressed satisfaction with the outcome of 
the discussion on Kosovo in the Belgian Parliament, in 
particular with Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes's speech, 
in which, according to Rugova, he had said that Kosovo Albanians 
were now no longer satisfied with the Yugoslav Constitution of 
1974 [that gave them the status of an autonomous province within 
Serbia]. The DSK leader interpreted this as a sign of support 
for the [ethnic] Albanian demand for an independent and neutral 
Kosovo. 
  Rugova welcomed recent demonstrations of Albanians in 
European cities and confirmed that the organizers were the DSK 
and other Albanian associations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Army General Lyuben Petrov, commander of the </F>
Bulgarian Army General Staff, by Neneva Andonova; place and date 
not given: "Main Thing Now Is To Remove the Barrier Created by 
the Cold War"] 
  [Text] [Andonova] General, do you seriously think that 
Bulgaria will be the first state to join NATO if the Alliance 
starts to admit new members? 
  [Petrov] This is our wish and we would like to think that it 
will be so. To judge from the hospitality that we were shown at 
NATO Headquarters, and if the Alliance really expands, we could 
be optimists and believe that in the near future Bulgaria will 
receive a vote of confidence and will be among the first new 
NATO members. 
  [Andonova] Do you think that our state enjoys greater 
attention than the other Eastern European states? 
  [Petrov] I cannot commit myself to assessments as to who is 
in first place in NATO's eyes. It is the politicians who must 
follow and assess this. From my position as an observer I think 
that confidence in Bulgaria is strengthening daily in NATO's 
higher structures. 
  [Andonova] What do you think determines whether a state is 
admitted to NATO, the behavior of the candidates or 
international circumstances? 
  [Petrov] The admission of any Eastern European state depends 
on NATO's leadership. According to the Washington Charter it 
alone can propose and invite new members. Naturally, the 
activity of the candidates in strengthening the structures of 
international security is of exceptional importance. I think 
that NATO will also have other criteria, but I do not want to 
dwell on them -- this is not within my scope of activity. 
  The main thing now is to remove the barrier created by the 
Cold War between East and West. We must stop seeing each other 
as enemies. Mutual reproaches as to who was guilty are 
senseless and obsolete relics, which we must forget. 
  [Andonova] Has the "old thinking" been overcome in the Army? 
  [Petrov] We are doing everything possible to overcome the 
image of the enemy, especially in the Balkan peninsula, and I 
think that we have achieved a lot. However, all the state 
institutions must work in the same direction. The contours of 
the past have not been fully eliminated. 
  [Andonova] Where do those contours still exist -- at the 
level of the higher leaderships or at the lower levels of the 
army's hierarchy? 
  [Petrov] At all levels. 
  [Andonova] Do you see common denominators in the military, 
regardless of what specific country is involved and of what 
specific organization it is a member? 
  [Petrov] I fully agree that the military has similar 
criteria and assessments regarding security, and are equally 
concerned with the stability of regions that contain hotbeds of 
tension. 
  [Andonova] Is NATO seriously concerned with the 
Yugoconflict? 
  [Petrov] NATO is following with great concern the events in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and is determining its steps with exceptional 
caution. I can say that they are more concerned than the Balkan 
states. It may sound strange, but this is what I felt during my 
meetings in Brussels. 
  [Andonova] Is this the reason for NATO's increased attention 
toward our country? 
  [Petrov] Perhaps. They are interested in all the factors 
that could influence the conflict, and in the historical factors 
in the Balkans. They are carefully observing the behavior and 
position of every state in the region regarding the crisis. 
From this point of view we really are the object of increased 
attention. They assess our position very highly and do not hide 
this. I think that Bulgaria's principled position will have an 
important role in resolving the conflict. 
  [Andonova] Why is NATO more concerned than us with the 
Yugocrisis? 
  [Petrov] I have the feeling that people in our country think 
that foreign structures and factors will resolve the problem. 
The absence of an immediate threat prompts us to assume a calm 
posture, and this situation could play a bad joke on us at some 
given moment. 
  [Andonova] Our integration in the international security 
structures could be a gradual process. Do you think that from 
this point of view the Partnership for Peace initiative has a 
serious role? 
  [Petrov] The new partners must participate in the initiative 
in such a way that it could justify the very existence of the 
initiative. One cannot speak about integration through the 
initiative, but it will strengthen East-West confidence to a 
large degree. 
  The Partnership for Peace has a certain aspect, which 
justifiably causes concern among our public and other countries 
that have signed the framework document. We all want guarantees 
of our security, but the Partnership for Peace initiative does 
not provide such guarantees. Both the framework document and 
the invitation to participate point out that no guarantees are 
assumed. They envisage political consultations under NATO 
leadership when security is threatened, but this is no guarantee. 
  [Andonova] Our country must prepare a document on our 
participation in the initiative. Are you informed about the 
preparation of this document? 
  [Petrov] A supradepartmental commission has been 
established. Representatives of the Ministries of Defense, 
Foreign Affairs, and Finance are on it. The General Staff also 
has a basic role in preparing the national program. We must 
prepare a realistic and feasible program, even though our 
financial means are very limited. As you know, all expenditure 
on joint enterprises must be financed by the partners. The 
framework document allows every state to determine alone the 
degree of its participation. The commission is working hard and 
in the near future it will propose a draft to be submitted to 
the Council of Ministers and then parliament. Only then could 
we talk about real participation. 
  [Andonova] What does the draft contain more specifically ? 
  [Petrov] Naturally, certain enterprises could be eliminated 
from and others included in the draft. It envisages the 
participation of our military representatives in NATO's 
Coordinating Center in Mons -- most probably three Bulgarian 
officers. We discussed this with the supreme commander of NATO 
Allied Forces, General Dowland [title as published]. They even 
expressed their considerations on the qualifications of our 
officers. We will also have representatives at NATO 
Headquarters -- probably politicians or representatives of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense. On the 
basis of the national program our military and political 
representatives will make proposals and coordinate our 
participation in NATO. In addition to forums and consultations 
joint training is also envisaged. Since participation in such 
enterprises is rather expensive, at this stage we will restrict 
ourselves to minimal formations. We will begin at a lower level 
and gradually increase the scope of our participation. 
Actually, it is to early to reveal the entire draft program. 
  [Andonova] Is there good coordination between the General 
Staff, the Defense Ministry, and the military office of the 
president in deciding on participation in joint initiatives? 
  [Petrov] The Ministry of Defense has made a special decision 
to instruct the defense minister to coordinate this activity and 
propose a final draft. 
  [Andonova] My next question is "personal": Are there 
serious differences among the leading figures regarding our 
behavior toward NATO? 
  [Petrov] As far as a new element in our relations with NATO 
is involved -- the beginning of partnership -- it is normal to 
have differences regarding our participation in this initiative. 
One should not make any tragedy out of this. The moment the 
program is adopted it becomes a national program and thus 
obligatory for all the institutions involved. I cannot commit 
myself to assessing the various positions, but if everything is 
determined without comparing different positions we could not 
speak about democracy. 
  [Andonova] Are we left with any choice after joining the 
international security system, for example, outside the 
Partnership for Peace initiative? 
  [Petrov] So far we have achieved a lot on the bilateral 
foundation for strengthening confidence with NATO -- with all 
states, including European states outside NATO. The Partnership 
for Peace initiative allows for cooperation on multilateral 
foundation and expands the scope of activities without 
restricting bilateral contacts. 
  [Andonova] With which NATO members will we have the most 
active contacts? 
  [Petrov] We will continue to develop our relations with our 
neighbors Greece and Turkey very actively, and also with 
Belgium. It is with Belgium of all the other Western European 
states that we have the best mutual relations and close 
cooperation. Confidence between us is at the highest level. 
One of our officers worked for three months on the General 
Staff of the Belgian Army. We have become acquainted at very 
close range with their military structures and the organization 
of their work. We have much in common in anything related to 
the number of population and the size of the army. We also have 
similar problems in implementing the reform -- the Belgians are 
advancing toward a professional army. For the time being only 
the United States, the UK, and Luxembourg have such armies. All 
other countries only claim that they will advance toward this. 
Belgium is the first to make serious steps toward this and its 
experience will be very useful to us. 
  [Andonova] You also were received by NATO's political 
leadership, visited SHAPE -- NATO's supreme headquarters in 
Europe -- and met with the chief of the Belgian General Staff. 
What were the most important elements of your visit? 
  [Petrov] You see what the level of the meetings was -- there 
was not a single secondary or unimportant talk. At joint 
briefings at the headquarters and the Supreme Command we were 
briefed in detail about NATO's structure and tasks under the new 
international conditions, and on the envisaged cooperation with 
the new partners. We briefed them on the progress of the reform 
in the Bulgarian Army. Actually, they are well informed about 
our military doctrine. We were flattered by the exceptionally 
positive reaction of specialists of the highest rank regarding 
the context of our military doctrine and its European spirit. 
In SHAPE in Mons we discussed with General Dowland and top 
officers future cooperation in the military sphere and within 
the Partnership for Peace initiative. The supreme commander 
himself showed us the building in which our officers will work. 
The offices, halls, and so forth are ready. Generally, I saw 
real soldiers and real professionals at NATO Headquarters. 
  My last meeting was with my Belgian colleague, General 
Charlier. We visited a mechanized brigade and were briefed on 
details related to its transition toward professionalism. We 
saw the training of pilots at air force bases. We also viewed 
the training of a "blue helmets" unit that will be sent to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Andonova] Were you informed about NATO's intentions 
regarding Macedonia? 
  [Petrov] We asked both at NATO's headquarters and in Mons 
what additional steps they envisage regarding former Yugoslavia. 
The answer was -- "what the politicians decide." As all 
military everywhere, they will carry out any orders that they 
receive. We are no different -- we too implement political 
decisions. In this respect I see absolutely no difference in 
our positions. 
  [Andonova] Do Bulgarian politicians have a correct attitude 
toward you? 
  [Petrov] I do not want to evaluate them. I have only one 
wish -- that they really are more precise in working out their 
decisions.

  [Text] We received a statement from a spokesman for the 
president, related to articles in today's Bulgarian newspapers 
which quote the Greek TO VIMA daily to the fact that President 
Zhelev was subjected to active foreign pressure. 
  The spokesman for the president recalls that President 
Zhelev 
was the first to determine the priorities of the new Bulgarian 
foreign policy and formulated the principles of the Bulgarian 
position regarding former Yugoslavia. 
  Bulgaria declared already at the very beginning of the 
conflicts to the west of our border that it will not take 
advantage of former Yugoslavia's difficulties and that it will 
not interfere in any military manner in the events there, and 
appealed to all other Balkan countries neighboring Yugoslavia to 
adopt the same position. 
  It is a fact that the Balkan countries are burdened by their 
past and any military interference on their part could become a 
precondition of a new Balkan war. 
  This Bulgarian policy is upheld by the president in all 
international contacts. It also figures in President Zhelev's 
correspondence with Turkish President Demirel, about which the 
Bulgarian public is well-informed. 
  The Bulgarian mass media are very clear regarding this 
position, even to such a degree that they do not think it is 
purposeful to repeat it constantly and thus assume the risk of 
becoming the target of their readers' ridicule, the president's 
spokesman continues. Nevertheless, one is puzzled by the 
attention they devote to the claims of a Greek newspaper, which 
are completely unfounded and unsupported by any facts or 
evidence, and which obviously pursue political goals which 
undermine Bulgaria's prestige, the statement of the president's 
spokesman reads.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Khristo Bardaliev: "I Had a Bad Dream About </F>
You, Dancho"] 
  [Text] The ways of Bulgarian democracy are strange indeed. 
In the name of some half-understood values and principles that 
allegedly guide modern society, we Bulgarians have been 
consciously dismantling our state for five years now. Now, all 
kinds of "parties" and organizations are unfurling their banners 
that are not only unconstitutional (and for that reason 
unregistered) but even openly declare that it is part of their 
program to split Bulgaria into an unknown number of components. 
  The Ilinden OMO [Ilinden United Macedonian Organization] is 
especially active in this respect. Despite not having any 
evident support in the Pirin region and being split into three 
mutually warring factions at the moment, the Ilinden members 
have the effrontery to give news conferences in the center of 
Sofia and to explain to the amazed fraternity of journalists 
what words like nation, minority, racism, and genocide really 
mean. 
  However, Ilinden OMO Chairman Yordan Ivanov committed a 
grave 
mistake. He demanded that the Bulgarian authorities, the army 
included, should pull out of the Pirin region, and then 
proceeded to utter threats against the Bulgarian majority in 
this region. 
  This proves that the gentleman in question really does not 
know his history, because when the official powers have 
withdrawn, this will leave only the structures of the VMRO-SMD 
(Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Union of 
Macedonian Societies, a pro-Bulgarian organization] there. 
  As they say in these parts, "I had a bad dream about you, 
Dancho."

allowed," President Gligorov stated during this year's Third 
European Dialogue Conference, speaking on the subject "The Road 
to Europe -- Too Many Conflicts." The conference was attended 
by Germany's top level scientists and politicians and a part of 
its diplomatic corps. Gligorov especially stressed the necessity 
of technical, financial, and other forms of aid for countries in 
transition. For developed Europe, this is a safest investment 
in a social peace and democracy on the continent. Macedonia's 
long-lasting determination is a process of European integration 
of the Balkans, and its place in it. That is why, Gligorov 
added, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM] insists on neighborly relations, cooperation, and 
inviolability of present borders of all Balkan countries. With 
Greece, we want to go into the future, and not some 2,000 years 
in the past, President Gligorov said. The one-sided embargo of 
this country is a threat to the stability in the region and 
worsens the social and economic situation in Macedonia, Gligorov 
ended. 
  Slovenian President Milan Kucan was also present at the 
conference, which was led by Bundestag's President Mrs. Rita 
Suessmuth. Mr. Kucan, who also pointed out his country's 
determination for an European option, answered participants' 
questions together with Mr. Gligorov. The Greek-Macedonian 
relations were in the focus of interest. Answering the 
questions Gligorov said: "The problem is irrational and of an 
emotional nature. The Balkan is too preoccupied with its 
history. The Republic of Macedonia has no territorial 
aspirations. It is ready to continue the dialogue with Greece, 
but without any ultimatums, accompanied by embargoes." 
President Gligorov requested that EU puts pressure on its 
member Greece, which is trying to solve problems through 
one-sided and illegal acts. 
  During his meeting with President Kucan, Mr. Gligorov 
discussed bilateral issues and the problems in the region. 
  Yesterday afternoon, President Gligorov was received by 
Germany's President Richard von Weiszecker. Among other things, 
they also discussed the dispute with Greece. The German 
president was interested in a way his country could help 
Macedonia to overcome this problem, emphasizing the Greek 
embargo is completely unacceptable. 
  President Gligorov also visited the Macedonian Embassy in 
Bonn.

  [Text] The Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] Government adopted the law on settlement of 
debts toward international institutions. According to this law, 
the firms will pay their 60 million denars debt owed to the 
international bank to the state instead. They are to settle the 
debt in eight years, with a grace period of three years and an 
annual interest rate of six percent, paid in five equal rates, 
starting from 31 March 1997. 
  The government also adopted the proposed law on changes in 
existing law on administrative taxes. This law balances 
administrative services taxes, including the state's diplomatic 
and consular representative offices abroad, with the predicted 
annual inflation of 70 percent. 
  Government members postponed the discussion on the law on 
census as the Statistics Institute submitted an incomplete 
financial report. The institute only informs of approved 
finances for the census procedure, but no formal confirmation 
has been received by any international financial institution so 
far. The census is evaluated to cost about $2.2 million and if 
the financial side is not settled in due time, it is hard to 
expect it will take place in June as planned.

<F P=106> [Report by S. Kiridjievska: "There Is No Free Privatization"] </F>
  [Text] Will trade in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] transform itself painlessly or 
will it go in the directions it has started -- street trade, 
poor-quality goods, and jumbled assortment? These were the 
points on which yesterday's debate concentrated, on the subject: 
"Transformation of trading companies with state capital," held 
in Skopje and organized by the Macedonian Chamber of Commerce 
and the Transformation Agency. Besides scientists, it was also 
attended by a large number of outstanding economists from the 
commercial sphere. 
  "We wanted to urge another initiative for faster transition, 
organization, and ownership restructuring in trade, as the 
priority task for the creation of new relations, which should 
lead to overcoming the present situation," the introductory 
speaker Duse Kotevski, vice president of the Macedonian Chamber 
of Commerce, said. While numbering the basic statistical 
indications about the real image of the situation in this 
economic branch, Kotevski located the roots of the problems in 
commerce. He said it was harmful to start liberalization 
without adequate solutions and organization, with illegal 
activities and disloyal competition. In concluding that the 
number of the legal subjects engaged in trade has significantly 
increased, he said that the modern shops with rich variety, 
catalogue sale, shopping centers, discount shops, and modern 
warehouses with terminal cashiers had been replaced by ugly 
sights in the streets, whose consequences will be long felt. 
  According to Ariton Zivkov, professor at the Faculty of 
Economics, there was no recipe for the complex process of 
transformation, however only those who were really interested in 
becoming tradesmen would be able to attain it. In his opinion 
this process in trade did not begin with Ante Markovic's law, 
but started the moment sales were completed with postponed 
payment in conditions of high inflation. One should not forget 
the small trading companies supplied themselves from the state 
companies by postponing the payment of debts, and sometimes not 
paying at all. At the same time, the state sector, according to 
Zivkov, had to meet the requirements of the state, contrary to 
the private sector, which piled up its capital. Calling this 
manner of privatization forced, Professor Zivkov explained he 
was doing his best to save resources. In his opinion, there 
would be no real transformation in trade without real 
efficiency, finance, personnel shifts, selection, and regional 
orientation, because trade can drive the economy only if it is 
given a chance. 
  Recalling some clarifications of the law on transformation, 
Miroljub Sukarov, manager of the Transformation Agency, said 
that priority could be given to nobody. "The process must begin 
with the concept of paid privatization, because our country is 
not rich, and there is no such thing as free privatization. If 
we do not form a body of financial resources, the social 
tensions will not be prevented, and the state must have money to 
maintain social peace. The law on transformation divides the 
companies into those that have, and those that have not started 
privatization, and it has to end in a period of two years." 
These were the words of professor Aleksandar Nikolovski from 
the Faculty of Economics. We must not wait and play tactics in 
transforming ourselves, because we are getting close to a deeper 
abyss. 
  Bobek Suklev, professor at the Economics Faculty 
provocatively started his discussion by saying, "I shall start 
my job by giving assessments with the question of whether the 
company is yours, that is, whether you can prove it is your 
property. From previous experience I know that companies do not 
have such proof at their disposal and that will slow down the 
process of privatization. Thus, the assessment will have to be 
based on experience, on the feeling for each particular 
situation, and on the basis of a subjective evaluation." 
  Joining the discussion, the economists showed interest in 
the 
fate of the shareholders' capital, the prohibition on selling 
objects with a value of over 50,000 German marks, as well as in 
putting a mortgage on objects when there is no capital turnover. 
They stated that it would be a great and unforgiving sin if this 
state took liquidation as the only prospect for the former state 
industry, but that would be inevitable if four conditions were 
not fulfilled. They are: a rigorous decrease in the gray 
economy, equal working conditions, an alteration to the Law on 
office space, computerization, but also a true division between 
the private and the state sectors. 
<H5>  [Box, p 3] </H5>
<H5>  Seminar on Privatization </H5>
  Today and tomorrow a seminar will be held at the Faculty of 
Law with privatization as the subject. There will be 12 
lecturers, nine of which are eminent professors of the Faculty 
of Law, and three are professors of the Faculty of Economics. 
Jane Miljovski, minister in the Macedonian Government, and 
Sofia Todorova, Minister of Development, will also present their 
views. The discussions will be concentrated on the 
privatization of state companies with 100 percent state capital 
that have not yet started the process of transformation 
according to the old laws.

<F P=106> [Report by Jan Benes and Lubor Kohout: "We Are Under the </F>
Threat of Bacteriological Weapons!"] 
  [Text] According to findings by CESKY DENIK reporters, a 
very dangerous species [kmen] of bacteriological and virological 
[virologicky] weapons are secretly stored on the Czech 
Republic's territory. Our country is a signatory to the Geneva 
Convention, which obliges us not to allow our Army to develop 
bacteriological or virological weapons, use them, or store them 
without international approval. 
  Within the framework of the former Warsaw Pact, the then 
Czechoslovak Socialist Republic was authorized to develop 
bacteriological weapons. A very secret site was designated for 
this purpose in the Military Research Institute near Techonin in 
the Orlicke Hory mountains. The Research Institute operated 
within the framework of the Military Medical Academy in Hradec 
Kralove. Scientists from other Warsaw Pact countries 
participated in the development and testing of these very 
dangerous and inhuman weapons. They were mostly from the former 
Soviet Union -- from a Leningrad institute -- Bulgarians, and 
others. CESKY DENIK reporters have found out that the species 
of the bacteria and viruses developed in Techonin had been 
stored in various places in the Czech Republic until recently. 
On other, unknown places, they may still be stored. This is not 
only a violation of the Czech Republic's international 
obligations, but also a criminal act -- at the very least -- of 
posing a public threat with unpredictable consequences. 
  It is very likely that in the Military Research Institute in 
Technonin species of biological weapons are still being stored, 
or have been destroyed only very recently. They are for 
example, a culture of cholera, the plague, smallpox, tularemia, 
meningitis, and the rare psittacosis.

unidentified correspondent in Bratislava on 16 March -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Correspondent] Minister, what basic changes can 
be expected in your sector after you have taken office? 
  [Kanis] It would not be good to speak right now about what 
could be expected in the sector. I would rather stress that I 
would like to follow up the trend whose foundations have been 
laid by Minister Andrejcak. It is the trend of the Slovak 
Republic entering the European security structures. 
  As you may well know, I was the author of [word indistinct] 
programs of the Party of the Democratic Left, which were the 
first to push through the orientation towards NATO. This fact 
may have been taken into consideration in choosing a candidate 
for the post of defense minister. 
  [Correspondent] The Slovak Republic was more successful in 
concluding agreements eastward so far. Do you envisage any 
change during your term of office? 
  [Kanis] I do not think that the republic was more successful 
eastward as the Slovak Republic has achieved many successes in 
becoming closer to Western European security structures. I 
think that the decision on Slovakia's security orientation is 
unambiguous. We only have to find appropriate (?firms) and 
appropriate ways to implement this trend to strengthen the 
integration into Western security structures. It is a political 
as well as a military and financial issue. 
  [Correspondent] Do you have any conceptual solutions ready? 
  [Kanis] It would not be very appropriate to give you a 
positive answer. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with new Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner by </F>
Ivan Samel at Bratislava Castle following the swearing-in of the 
new government on 16 March --recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Samel] Minister, what changes do you plan to 
take in your ministry? 
  [Pittner] First of all, we are going to create conditions, 
be 
they personnel or organizational, to ensure calm in the streets, 
to ensure calm in society as far as crime is concerned, as well 
as in relation to certain manifestations of hatred that can be 
expected at times of political change. My view therefore is 
that our task, rather than reorganizing the ministry, will be to 
take measures so that the citizens have the chance to prepare 
themselves in a free and democratic atmosphere for early 
elections and vote in accordance with their conscience. 
  [Samel] Does it mean that you are not planning any changes 
in 
the system, for example, in relations among the police, the 
Interior Ministry, and other relevant bodies? 
  [Pittner] It is quite possible that some changes will have 
to 
be made in the Police Presidium, since, in my view -- which, 
however, is not very well-informed at the moment; I will need to 
have the situation analyzed -- it has become bloated and has 
perhaps become, I am exaggerating now, a second ministry. 
[passage omitted] My aim will be to slim down the Police 
Presidium and ensure that it is effective and performs tasks 
necessary for the benefit of the citizen. 
  [Samel] What steps do you intend to take in connection with 
the investigation of the events of 14 March, when four 
journalists were assaulted in Primate Square? 
  [Pittner] It is a very serious matter. Alas, it was very 
irresponsible of the previous government to turn down the 
president's request that it remain in office until the new 
government was appointed; this meant that the police lost their 
top leadership, which must have influenced the way they acted. 
On the other hand, it does not exonerate those policemen who 
did not fulfill their duties. If it is proven that the 
accusations were true, or that they refused to help others 
because of political reasons or inclinations to different 
political views, the most strict legal measures will be taken in 
accordance with the law on the police corps. [passage omitted]

  Bratislava, 1 March 1994. 

<H6>    The Slovak Republic Defense Doctrine </H6>
  The Slovak Republic evolved as a modern, democratic, and 
European state. By their decision to establish an independent 
state, the citizens of the Slovak Republic also assumed the 
responsibility for defending their own interests. 
  The Slovak Republic promulgates the principles for its 
defense policy in a Defense Doctrine that expresses its 
enduring, political, legal, and methodological basis. The SR 
Defense Doctrine proceeds from the fact that the Slovak Republic 
does not perceive itself to be under an immediate threat, but 
that -- in the current military-political situation -- it 
reserves the right and capacity to defend itself against a 
possible military or nonmilitary threat. 
  The fundamental principles of the SR Defense Doctrine are: 
  1. The assertion of the Slovak Republic's national interests 
with the objective of guaranteeing its territorial integrity and 
the inviolability and unchangeability of its internationally 
recognized state borders. The Defense Doctrine proceeds from 
the sovereignty of the Slovak Republic in dealing with all the 
issues concerned with the state's determination to defend itself 
in harmony with the right to self-defense in accordance with the 
UN Charter. The Slovak Republic is not limited in its 
independence and autonomy by anything other than the sovereign 
right of other states and the commitments to which it has 
voluntarily bound itself. 
  2. The binding and non-conflictive nature of the defense 
measures executed and the policies pursued by the Slovak 
Republic with regard to the basic international legal documents 
and the principles arising from them. In particular, this 
involves the following principles: The rejection of a threat by 
force or the use of force; the obligation to seek a peaceful 
solution to problems and not to interfere in the internal 
affairs of another state; the obligation of states to cooperate 
with each other; the recognition of the equal rights and 
self-determination of all nations; the sovereign equality of 
states; and thorough adherence to adopted commitments. 
  The Slovak Republic makes no claim to greater guarantees for 
its security than it provides to other states. Under no 
circumstances will it initiate an armed conflict and it will not 
start one against another state. It has no political, 
territorial, historical, national, economic, or social reasons 
for doing so. The Slovak Republic does not possess or 
manufacture nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction and it 
will not strive to own them. It will not permit the deployment 
or storage of these weapons on its sovereign territory. 
  The Slovak Republic does not condone the propaganda of war 
and armed force, terrorism, chauvinism, fascism, racial and 
class hatred, or national and religious intolerance. 
  3. Harmony between the Slovak Republic's domestic and 
foreign policy and security and defense policy, while respecting 
the specificity of its geopolitical position. The Slovak 
Republic will assert its national interests in a coordinated 
manner with regard to the international environment in the 
interest of lasting peaceful cooperation with all democratic 
states, with emphasis on neighboring countries, and with the aim 
of becoming involved in the formation of a cooperative European 
security system that eliminates military confrontation. The 
Slovak Republic is not forfeiting its right to take part in 
guaranteeing coalition security; therefore, it will try to join 
NATO and the Western European Union [WEU]. It is also not 
forfeiting its right to participate in UN activities as a 
guarantor of peace and security, especially as far as activities 
in the sphere of preventive diplomacy are concerned. 
  4. The general civil defense of the Slovak Republic. The 
defense of the Slovak Republic corresponds to its constitutional 
system. It proceeds from the affinity between the citizens' 
rights and obligations guaranteed by the SR Constitution. The 
defense of the republic is a matter of honor for each citizen. 
Citizens are conscripted in accordance with the law, but they 
also have the right to participate in defending the interests of 
the Slovak Republic and the state's democratic order. The 
impartiality of the military authorities is an element of the 
Slovak Republic's security guarantees. Civilian supervision of 
the military authorities -- by utilizing the mechanisms of 
parliamentary democracy, which guarantees the army's detachment 
from partial political interests -- is executed in its interest. 
  5. The commensurate size of the Armed Forces corresponding 
to the principles of defensive sufficiency and the need for a 
rational deterrent. The objective of the Slovak Republic's 
defense policy is to prevent war on the basis of the optimum 
composition of the Armed Forces and the resources predestined 
for defense or, as the case may be, to ward off an attack and to 
reestablish the situation prior to the onset of foreign 
aggression. The main task of the deterrent is to attain a 
situation whereby the risks associated with aggression outweigh 
unequivocally any conceivable advantages that a potential 
attacker could gain. Our doctrine is not offensive. The Slovak 
Republic's defense begins on its own borders and provisions are 
made for it throughout its territory. The Slovak Republic will 
strictly adhere to the restrictions laid down by the 
international agreements on the numbers of personnel and main 
types of weaponry for Armed Forces. Furthermore, it will strive 
to reduce the number of personnel and conventional weapons with 
the aim of creating the prerequisites for improving stability 
and preventing the outbreak of military and non-military threats 
and conflicts. 
  6. Equilibrium between defense requirements and the 
state's economic, political, spiritual, social, and demographic 
potential. The Slovak Republic's defense needs give full 
consideration to the state's individual capabilities, which -- 
in a fundamental manner -- influence its defensive prowess, 
especially its economic potential. 
  The Slovak Republic is establishing sovereign Armed Forces 
to 
defend the state's sovereignty, its territorial integrity, and 
its democratic system. The president of the Slovak Republic is 
their supreme commander. The armed elements of the Interior 
Ministry and other public armed elements will participate -- in 
cooperation with the Slovak Army -- in fulfilling the tasks 
pertaining to Slovakia's defense. The Slovak Army is a vital 
element of the Armed Forces and is an important guarantor of the 
state's sovereignty and integrity. 
  The main role of the Slovak Army is, on the basis of 
ascertaining the preparations for a military offensive, to ward 
off a threat to the state's sovereignty by the timely adoption 
of essential defensive measures on its own territory; in the 
event of an offensive, its role is to repel an air and ground 
assault by the aggressor from whichever direction and in 
whichever part of the territory. Those forces that have 
penetrated the state's territory must be dealt with by the 
regular or mobilized forces with the aim of restoring the 
state's territorial integrity and sovereignty; at the same time, 
it is necessary to make use of the political-military support 
arising from the cooperative system of European security. In 
close collaboration with civil defense and territorial bodies, 
it is necessary to make provisions for the defense and security 
of the population and facilities important for the functioning 
of the state and also for eliminating the aftermath of 
extraordinary situations. 
  The Ground Forces, Air Force, and Air Defense Forces form 
the 
basis of the Slovak Army. The Ground Forces are made up of 
field troops, rapid deployment forces, and territorial defense 
forces. The Air Force and Air Defense Forces are made up of air 
bases with fighter, fighter bomber, transport, and helicopter 
units and air defense units. Their exclusively defensive 
character is stipulated in a set of laws on the state's defense. 
  The Slovak Army is vertically structured and centrally 
commanded. It has comprehensive logistical support at its 
disposal for defense. It can be mobilized according to need. 
  The preparation and training of Slovak Army troops is 
carried 
out on the principle of observing general legal norms and civic 
values; on the principle of developing personal responsibility; 
in the spirit of patriotism, impartiality, and the military 
regulations; and on the principle of the commanders' direct and 
indivisible responsibility. 
  In order to guarantee the comprehensive defense of the state 
and its ability to function in a war and in order to make 
provisions for the Armed Forces, a system of economic 
mobilization is employed, the Slovak Republic's state material 
reserves are generated and utilized, civil defense measures are 
implemented, and operational arrangements for the state's 
territory are carried out. 
  The principles for the SR Defense Doctrine are codified and 
detailed in National Council of the Slovak Republic legislative 
acts. 
  The SR Defense Doctrine is implemented by the bodies of 
state 
authority coordinated by the SR State Defense Council and under 
the direct supervision of the representative bodies, which 
consider or -- as the case may be -- approve the fundamental 
documents for the state's defense policy. 
  Crucial issues regarding the state's defense policy and the 
means for carrying them out are contained in the SR Government's 
policy statements. 
  The military-specialist part of the SR Defense Doctrine is 
detailed in the Strategic Concept for the Defense of the Slovak 
Republic, in documents on the structure of the Armed Forces, in 
the plans for the state's economic mobilization, and in the 
operational plans and other follow-up documents that are 
constantly actualized in harmony with the development of the 
military-political and economic situation. 
  Supervision of the implementation of the SR Defense Doctrine 
in the Armed Forces is provided by the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic via the National Council of the Slovak Republic 
Petition, Legal Protection, and Security Committee and also by 
legislation, the budget, and the supervision of executive 
authority. 
<H5>  The Principles for the Slovak Republic's National Security </H5>
  The current security situation is the consequence of the 
fundamental changes that have taken place throughout the world 
recently. The Slovak Republic considers the transition from a 
bipolar world to the new multi-polar world to be its fundamental 
characteristic feature. The change in geopolitical conditions 
in Europe and throughout the world is leading to the collapse of 
some eastern-sphere composite states and to the formation of 
nation states. International relations have thus entered into a 
complicated period to which it is difficult to give a particular 
shape and whose time frame exceeds the year 2000. In connection 
with this, the role of the variable factors in the process of 
formulating and implementing the national interests of the 
individual geopolitical protagonists has increased. These are 
factors that proceed from the processes involved in the collapse 
of the bipolar system of international relations and from their 
constant development, which is often complicated by unexpected 
changes. This fact is extraordinarily sensitive for the Central 
European region and for the new democratic states that are going 
through a complex period of radical social and economic reforms. 
The domestic political, economic, and social lability of these 
countries is augmented by the absence of external security 
guarantees. 
  It is apparent from the tenor of the international political 
situation that, first and foremost, the risks ensuing from the 
instability of the individual states and regions -- from which 
threats and risks to neighboring states and regions may also 
arise -- and not the risks stemming the end of the heterogeneous 
bipolar system of international relations are the predominant 
ones in Europe. 
  The security of the Slovak Republic is an element of the 
broader framework of European and global security. The Slovak 
Republic is reliant on its own forces; however, at the same 
time, it places emphasis on constituting new international 
relations. It is counting, first and foremost, on NATO, the 
WEU, the CSCE, and the United Nations in its objectives for 
finding more effective guarantees for its own security. 
Slovakia has a key interest in cooperation with and membership 
in NATO and the WEU in view of the fact that, at the moment, 
NATO represents a force capable of responding in time -- by 
corresponding means and resources -- to the new security risks 
and threats in Central and Eastern Europe. The Slovak Republic 
considers its active involvement in the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council and the Partnership for Peace program, which 
operate significantly against the repeated division of Europe, 
to be an important starting point for achieving membership in 
NATO. 
  The Slovak Republic would like to contribute actively -- by 
its membership in the WEU -- to strengthening European security 
structures and to gain security guarantees of the highest 
caliber. 
  Cooperation with CSCE bodies, as well as activity within 
them, is important for the Slovak Republic from the point of 
view of its security interests. This involves an important 
Euro-Asian process, which the Slovak Republic considers to be 
the nucleus for a modern, cooperative security system. 
  The Slovak Republic accepts the United Nations as the 
supreme 
guarantor and global organization of collective security. It 
will also contribute in the future to making sure that the 
United Nations creates the conditions for averting conflicts and 
more effectively resolving local and regional conflicts. 
  The Slovak Republic considers stable, conflict-free, and 
correct relations with its immediate neighbors to be an 
important aspect for guaranteeing its national security. At the 
same time, it places a great deal of emphasis on intensifying 
and expanding economic, cultural, and humanitarian cooperation 
on the basis of the principle of "an equal with an equal" and 
non-interference in internal affairs. The development of 
regional cooperation plays a positive role in the Slovak 
Republic's security policy. It is striving to strengthen 
regional and cross-border cooperation in conjunction with this. 
It is interested in active involvement in the Visegrad Group as 
a political and economic coordinating forum for similarly 
oriented partners. It is also interested in the Central 
European Initiative, which can help to resolve many of the tasks 
of modern European cooperation. 
  In providing for the needs of its national security, the 
Slovak Republic proceeds from the need for equilibrium in its 
relations with all European states. At the moment, the Slovak 
Republic is achieving this objective especially by means of 
bilateral treaties. At the same time, it is aware of the 
positive role that the U.S. presence plays in Europe, and it is 
in favor of maintaining it. 
  The Slovak Republic is dealing with the ethnic minority 
issue 
and will deal with it on the basis of the civic principle in 
harmony with the CSCE and Council of Europe documents and the SR 
Constitution. It is, however, of the opinion that the 
tendencies toward irredentism and the internationalization of 
these issues, the casting of doubts on internationally 
recognized treaties by certain forces, and the abuse of history 
as an implement of current policy do not contribute to the 
stability of the Central European region. 
  The Slovak Republic's national security proceeds from its 
national interests. It represents a system of mutually 
complementary and cooperative elements and activities comprising 
an integrated system that creates the corresponding conditions 
for the natural economic, political, social, spiritual, and 
ecological development of the state. This system is guaranteed 
by institutions of a political, diplomatic, international-legal, 
economic, ecological, humanitarian, defense, and intrinsic 
security (police and special) nature. 
  From the point of view of safeguarding the Slovak Republic's 
external security, risks and dangers associated with the 
following are at the forefront: 
  -- the repercussions from the utilitarian assertion of the 
interests of powers in the Central European region; 
  -- the lability and ambiguity of political and economic 
development in some of the republics on the territory of the 
former Soviet Union; 
  -- the danger of the internationalization of the armed 
conflict in the Balkans; 
  -- the uncontrollable movement of weapons and military 
hardware, which is conveyed by various means to crisis regions; 
  -- the possible tendencies toward increasing the weapons 
capacity in the Central European region above the framework 
exceeding the needs of defensive sufficiency; 
  -- the manifestations of nationalism and the tendency to 
create ethnically pure states along with the attempt to revise 
the internationally legal framework for the current arrangement 
in Europe; 
  -- religious fundamentalism associated, first and foremost, 
with Islam; 
  -- international terrorism and internationally organized 
crime (drugs, money laundering, tax evasion); 
  -- the activity of foreign intelligence services targeted on 
penetrating the state's domestic political, economic, and 
military structures; 
  -- the problems developing outside Europe, especially in the 
Middle and Near East and Africa. 
  Despite the crucial role played by the external aspect of 
national security, the Slovak Republic is devoting no less 
attention to constituting the domestic dimension of its security. 
  Carrying out the defense of internal order and security 
falls, first and foremost, to the police, the Prosecutor's 
Office, and the judiciary. Other institutions, including local 
state administration bodies, community bodies, state 
enterprises, the private business sphere, and other 
organizations, including the security services, must play a more 
active role in guaranteeing this defensive function. 
  From the point of view of guaranteeing the Slovak Republic's 
internal security, risks associated with the following are at 
the forefront: 
  -- the rise in nationalism and irredentism among a certain 
part of the population with possible tendencies toward violating 
the integrity of the state's territory; 
  -- violation of the Slovak Republic's state borders in 
connection with the increased migration of the population from 
third countries; 
  -- the evolution and anti-constitutional activity of 
extremist- oriented political organizations; 
  -- the rise of organized crime and international forms of 
crime, including terrorism, blackmail, and drug-related problems; 
  -- the rise in and seriousness of crime threatening the 
lives, health, and property of physical and legal persons; 
  -- crime committed by high-risk groups with a tendency 
toward 
repeated offenses, alcoholism, drug addiction and a tendency to 
deal with such conduct by illegal means and resources; 
  -- crime committed in connection with the privatization 
process and the transition to a market economy; 
  -- the appearance of organized corruption in state bodies, 
especially in the police force, the Prosecutor's Office, and the 
judiciary as well as in local self-administration bodies; 
  -- an extraordinary situation (natural disasters, 
technological accidents and catastrophes, and the risks and 
threats to the environment caused by military activity). 
  The aim of guaranteeing the Slovak Republic's national 
security is: 
  1. To multilaterally safeguard its independence and protect 
its sovereignty and territorial integrity and the inviolability 
and unchangeability of its internationally recognized borders; 
  2. To intensify cooperation and achieve the Slovak 
Republic's 
gradual integration into the international economic, political, 
security, and cultural structures; 
  3. To bolster stability and peace with emphasis on the 
region 
of Central Europe. To make careful use of the opportunity to 
take part in peace missions, dealing with conflicts, and 
averting armed aggression; 
  4. To guarantee the state's constitutionality and internal 
stability, including respect for human rights and basic 
freedoms, the rights of the ethnic minorities, democracy, the 
functioning of a law-governed state, economic freedom, social 
justice, and responsibility toward the environment; 
  5. To achieve a standard of security for the individual and 
to protect the interests of society as a whole in a manner 
comparable with the democratic countries of Europe. 
  In guaranteeing its national security, the Slovak Republic 
proceeds from these main principles: 
  1. From undertaking responsibility for the state's overall 
viability. National security must provide guarantees for the 
Slovak Republic's general survival, its sovereignty, its 
territorial integrity and the inviolability of its 
internationally recognized borders, and the functioning of a 
democratic regime. In view of the fact that the importance of 
the political factor in guaranteeing its security is increasing, 
the Slovak Republic is interested in achieving eventual 
membership in the European Union, NATO, and the WEU. 
  2. From consistency and equilibrium between the Slovak 
Republic's national interests and regional, continental, and 
global interests. 
  The Slovak Republic supports the creation of the kind of 
cooperative security system in Europe that would offer all 
states together and individually an equal amount of certainty. 
It ascribes a significant role in this to the CSCE. 
  3. From intensifying trust and the mutual flow of 
information 
in all spheres of national security in the spirit of the Paris 
Charter for a New Europe. The Slovak Republic will contribute 
to reducing the global and local risks of the outbreak of war, 
armed conflicts or, alternatively, to precluding the use of 
force or threat by force. 
  4. From protecting the Slovak Republic's economic interests. 
The Slovak Republic will actively contribute to removing 
discriminatory barriers and will support mutually advantageous 
economic cooperation with the aim of becoming integrated into 
advanced economic structures, first and foremost, the European 
Union and the European Free Trade Association. 
  5. From the priority of preventive activity in guaranteeing 
the state's domestic security. The Slovak Republic is 
interested in creating and implementing a pan-social system of 
prevention and in determining responsibility for its planning, 
organization, and development on a nationwide, regional, and 
local level. The Slovak Republic will create the necessary 
basis for a comprehensive, systemic, and coordinated course of 
action in guaranteeing the state's internal security on the 
basis of constitutionality and legality. 
  6. From limiting the factors that lead to the pollution of 
the environment. The Slovak Republic is providing for the 
sensible exploitation of exhaustible natural resources and 
guarantees the reliable operation of its existing energy, 
especially nuclear and chemical, and other capacities. 
  Despite the fact that, at the moment, it is not easy to 
determine the hierarchy of the individual aspects of security in 
the Central European region, it is evident that military-defense 
sufficiency fulfills an important role, because, in the final 
analysis, it demonstrates the state's existence and thus also 
the possibilities for exercising influence on the other aspects 
of national security. If the Slovak Republic is unsuccessful in 
realizing its interest in becoming integrated into the European 
security structures, it will be compelled to earmark sufficient 
resources to guarantee an adequate and resolute defense so that 
the Slovak Republic is capable of facing possible risks and 
dangers.

  [Excerpt] The session of the National Council of Slovakia 
continues in Bratislava. Our correspondent Renata Havranova, 
editor of the PRACE daily, has details of this morning's 
deliberations. 
  [Havranova] The Slovak parliament has again debated and 
passed the bill on privatization. After the fiasco suffered by 
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar when the parliament refused his 
idea of personal union of the government and the National 
Property Fund, Meciar had the law returned by the president to 
the parliament. However, the deputies confirmed the original 
decision, according to which the prime minister cannot hold the 
post of chairman of the presidium of the National Property Fund 
and the finance minister cannot hold the post of chairman of the 
fund's control board. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by Aleksander </F>
Geryn; place and date not given;from the "Balance -- 
Governmental Magazine" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Pawlak] The agreement with 
the London Club finalizes the main process of restructuring the 
Polish foreign debt. On the one hand, it has a very practical 
aspect pertaining to a reduction of the indebtedness level; on 
the other hand, a very important aspect is the adoption of a 
timeframe for repayments in a way that would take into account 
the realistic capabilities of our state budget which is the 
result of the economic and budget situations. It is worth 
stressing here that a rescheduling of repayments to the London 
Club is advantageous also from the standpoint of the timeframe 
adopted by the Paris Club. Thanks to the agreement with the 
Paris Club....[Pawlak pauses] One must stress that recently, the 
London Club agreement was negotiated by Dresdner Bank, and the 
role of the Germans in leading up to the successful finalization 
of the talks is worth stressing here. On our part -- over the 
last six months -- we undertook various initiatives, both on the 
official level and in informal contacts, to lead to a successful 
completion of the agreement in question. The agreement -- while 
finalizing the process of restructuring the foreign debt -- 
sends a very clear message indeed, that Poland is a stable 
country which meets its obligations, and that is one of the 
determining factors when it comes to possibilities for 
cooperation, including major capital investments. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Geryn] In January, there was the Prague meeting, in 
February -- the Brussels summit, and in March -- the Moscow 
meeting. In Prague, you talked about Partnership for 
Development. Is the Moscow visit a first step -- as it were -- 
on the way to implementing this proposal of yours? 
  [Pawlak] The visit to Prague was actually the first step, 
since we want to see Partnership for Development as a process 
that primarily makes our region dynamic -- I mean the countries 
of Central Europe -- and during the Prague talks with the prime 
ministers, we talked about several specific types of measures 
that could possibly contribute to making cooperation among the 
governments more dynamic. These talks pertained to a speeding 
up of the implementation of measures regarding a free-trade zone 
in Central Europe which encompasses Poland, the Czech and Slovak 
Republic, and Hungary. That was the first step. During the 
Brussels talks, we also made it clear that what we need is 
partnership-like and balanced cooperation. The most recent 
visit -- that is the one to Moscow -- constitutes a completion 
of the process. The point is to stress the fact that Polish 
foreign policy should be targeted in many directions, and it 
should be open to those partners who want to cooperate with us 
on a very practical basis. [passage omitted] 
  There is no easy way out of this, especially since right 
now, after a few years have passed, it is very hard to find the 
right conversion currency or to settle these transactions, and 
it is really not that clear at all who would gain more out of it 
given zero options. So what we wanted to do, was to concentrate 
on setting routine cooperation in motion. If cooperation 
develops dynamically and if we manage to sign agreements on 
contracts for delivery of strategic raw materials for many years 
to come, and if we adopt a trade protocol for 1994, then the 
results of these measures will make it possible to solve the 
problems of the past and of mutual debts more easily and more 
efficiently. These factors can definitely contribute to making 
cooperation more dynamic. Apart from that, we also talked about 
an infrastructure for cooperation and development broadly 
speaking -- beginning with cooperation among banks to make 
settling accounts easier, to enable companies to get in touch 
with one another faster, and to make economic exchange safer. 
Another element is the construction of a pipeline to make use 
of the potential resources of our economies, as well as 
construction of a highway and a railway that would connect 
Berlin with Warsaw, Minsk, and Moscow. Those are the factors 
that the government can influence, and these possibilities will 
later be implemented by specific companies and people. That is 
also the general scheme of looking for measures that would 
constitute the Partnership for Development. 
  [Geryn] Mr. Prime Minister, you talked to your counterpart, 
that is Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, and the conversation was 
quite long, outside of the binding protocol. What is your 
assessment of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin? 
  [Pawlak] I think what is very important is the practical 
approach to various issues. A very interesting conclusion from 
the conversations is that one can clearly see that the time we 
have wasted cannot be made up now or redeemed with any kind of 
money. And now, what is important is that when it comes to the 
practical side, one must move very clearly ahead, even if these 
are small steps. During the talks, we debated some principles 
of cooperation, then during plenary talks we agreed on specific 
measures and a timeframe for their implementation. During the 
talks, we came to a mutual conclusion that a visit by Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin to Poland may take place in May, which may 
constitute the next stage in the practical implementation of 
various agreements and measures both by the government 
administration, and by specific companies, which would expand 
cooperation. I think that to go from a high level of grand 
ideologies down to the level of practical action, will 
significantly improve our mutual relations to our mutual 
advantage.

<F P=106> [Report by B.I.W. and P.W.R.: "`Solidarity' Before Talks </F>
With Pawlak; Either Success or Protest"] 
  [Text] Members of the National Committee [KK] of 
"Solidarity" ["S"] are dissatisfied with the course of the 
strike action that has been carried out so far. At a session of 
KK it was stressed, among other things, that the protests are 
not sufficiently coordinated and that they started at the wrong 
time. However, the trade union does not intend to abandon the 
action, because it can see that the strikes "are softening" the 
government. If the talks with Prime Minister Pawlak, scheduled 
to be held on Friday [18 March], end up in failure, "S" might 
stage a one-day general strike. The greater part of the KK 
session was closed to the press. 
<H5>  To Be There Before Spychalska </H5>
  "S" Head Marian Krzaklewski said that it would be enough if 
the talk with the prime minister lasted the scheduled one hour, 
or even 15 minutes, if Pawlak says that he will implement the 
"S" demands. If not, there is too little time. 
  An hour after the meeting with Krzaklewski, the prime 
minister has an appointment to meet with Ewa Spychalska, 
chairperson of the All-Polish Trade Union's Agreement. It can 
be expected that the "S" chairman will want to avoid a 
troublesome meeting. 
  The heads of all the regions and branches are supposed to 
wait in Warsaw for the results of the meeting with the prime 
minister. Should the negotiations end up in failure, "S" will 
organize a mass protest, declares Krzaklewski. Asked whether 
lignite mines will also participate in the action, he said that 
he did not know that yet, but he was just leaving for a meeting 
with the Strike Committee. The Lignite Section (its plants 
supply 50 percent of the country's energy) does not exclude the 
possibility of strikes if the government accepts the new popiwek 
[tax on excessive wage increases] bill. The union decided to 
start the sixth collective bargaining session with the 
government. This time the problem is the fact that the "Pact on 
Enterprise" is not being implemented. 
<H5>  "S" Pickets in Front of the Sejm </H5>
  At 0830 today, "S" will start picketing the Sejm building, 
protesting the new popiwek bill. According to preliminary 
estimates of "S," participating in the protest throughout 
Thursday will be approximately 3,000 people, not counting the 
inhabitants of Warsaw. "S" announces that the picket will end 
only after the bill is either adopted or rejected. 
  Union members warned the picket participants to keep special 
calm, because on Thursday afternoon they would have to meet in 
front of the parliament building with the demonstration of the 
Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, protesting the 
metropolitan Warsaw bill. 
  Between 0800 and 1200, as part of the "S" action, gas 
stations will not be selling gasoline in Bialystok Voivodship. 
Gasoline will only be sold to ambulances, fire brigade 
vehicles, and so on. On strike will also be the Rzeszow and 
Radom Regions -- the 2,000-person work force of the "Radoskor" 
is supposed to stop working for two hours. 
  Yesterday, local transportation workers in Katowice and 
several dozen plants in the Bydgoszcz region were on strike. 
  KK adopted the budget for the first six months. The union's 
receipts in that period (17.5 billion zlotys) will equal 
outlays. The greatest amount of money comes from dues -- 13 
billion zlotys; it spends the greatest amount on salaries for KK 
members -- 5 billion. The union has also earmarked some money 
for the organization of the congress -- 1 billion zlotys, and 
for the work of the Constitutional Committee ("S" plus 
extra-parliamentary center-rightist groupings) -- 140 million 
zlotys. The budget was criticized, among other people, by 
Mazowsze Region Head Maciej Jankowski, because too little money 
was allocated for the organization of demonstrations and 
training. 
  "S" is indignant at the violation of human rights in China 
and will forward a letter to that government, in which it will 
demand that political prisoners be released. Signatures of "S" 
members will be collected on the letter. The union also 
criticized the behavior of the Polish delegation to the United 
Nations during voting on the resolution condemning human rights 
violations in China. 
  The next congress of the union will be held in Mielec.

studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is 
Minister Andrzej Drzycimski -- good morning to you, sir. 
  [Drzycimski] Good morning to you, and to you, ladies and 
gentlemen. 
  [Woyciechowski] We know for sure now that on Tuesday [22 
March], Prime Minister Pawlak will send the president a motion 
concerning the appointment of new Deputy Prime Minister Dariusz 
Rosati. What will the president do about the motion? Will he 
sign it, or not? 
  [Drzycimski] You know, I am not sure whether it will happen 
on Tuesday -- that is the first thing. The other issue is that 
at the point when the president receives the motion, he will 
then definitely talk to the prime minister, and he will 
deliberate on the issue. But so far, there has been no official 
document submitted to the president, nor have there been any 
talks that would concern this whole issue in a substantive way. 
  [Woyciechowski] But it so happens that the entire press is 
speculating on the issue. So let me put it this way: Does the 
president have any reasons not to sign the nomination? 
  [Drzycimski] He does not have any reasons but he just has to 
take a good look at the man since so far there has been a 
candidacy which by the way was talked about by the media, but as 
regards the person who is the most concerned here -- that is the 
prime minister -- there have been no statements apart from a 
general statement that the president is familiar with such a 
candidacy. So I think that once the candidacy is officially 
presented, then the president will think about .... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Has it happened before that 
the president did not sign such a motion for appointment of a 
deputy prime minister or a minister? 
  [Drzycimski] Well, yes, I mean not when it comes to a deputy 
prime minister but there was the famous case of the minister of 
culture. That happened in the past. The president did not sign 
the motion, and that caused a specific political situation. So 
when it comes to that, the president will also try to assess 
[words indistinct] 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But do you think he will tend 
to sign it, or not? Is he willing to sign it? What is the 
situation? 
  [Drzycimski] You know, I never speak in terms of whether 
somebody could probably tend to do this or that since the 
decision in this case must be carefully deliberated by the 
president and therefore he has to have more information. We 
really do not know a lot about Mr. Rosati, I mean Professor 
Rosati. He is someone who is getting a lot of publicity 
currently from the mass media, he himself is outspoken, he 
presents his views. The issue requires a careful approach. The 
president never undertakes such things .... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean he never signs 
anything immediately but takes some time to think about it? 
  [Drzycimski] I mean he never does things that have not been 
thought through. Sometimes he signs something right away but 
then it has been thought through. But when it comes to Mr. 
Rosati, we actually do not know much. 
  [Woyciechowski] And what will he do [words indistinct] 
  [Drzycimski] This is even more so since Professor Rosati was 
abroad for the entire period when the main transformations were 
taking place in Poland. And so it is difficult to say right 
away whether someone knows his activities. We do not know a lot 
about this. 
  [Woyciechowski] And what about the budget? That is another 
document which needs to be signed by the president. And there 
are huge speculations going on as to whether he will sign it or 
not. 
  [Drzycimski] That is [hesitating] one of the big problems 
created by subsequent governing teams. Parliaments and 
governments take quite an easy-going approach to this, and then 
they leave it to the president to make the final decision, and 
they are positive that he will make a judicious decision, and so 
forth. I must say that the budget is ....[Drzycimski pauses] 
Generally speaking, a situation of social tension has been 
created about the state budget, since the whole election 
campaign in September was under slogans like: It Doesn't Have 
To Be That Way, It Shouldn't Be That Way, The Budget Must Be 
Changed, in other words that the budget be pro- social. All 
these are election slogans. And in practical terms, the budget 
-- presented to the parliament and going through subsequent 
stages there -- has not changed much apart from a few minor 
revisions, in comparison with what the previous governments had 
established and worked out regarding the entire concept. So one 
can say that all these enormous social hopes that had been 
aroused, were not reflected in the budget. 
  [Woyciechowski] You mean the budget is not a fulfillment 
of election promises? 
  [Drzycimski] Yes. And so the president is asking the 
question: What is the situation? Are society's hopes to be 
frustrated once again? Is the issue to be approached 
light-heartedly again, something along the lines of election 
promises and their implementation by a specific political 
coalition? That is why this is a difficult problem for the 
president since he has to view it from two perspectives: In 
political terms, I mean in terms that society had a right to 
expect because society had been presented with a change of a 
certain economic concept, and that change was not implemented in 
practice. The president's other problem -- I mean sort of in 
reverse -- is that the president is familiar with the state of 
the country and its budget, and he knows that when it comes to 
this budget, one cannot make many radical moves, as it were. 
That is a dilemma for a politician who must make difficult 
decisions, and they are difficult also for him. 
  [Woyciechowski] But that is a moral dilemma. What would 
happen politically speaking if the president refused to sign the 
budget? What are the consequences of [words indistinct] 
  [Drzycimski] The consequences are that the budget goes back 
to the parliament, and then it can be voted through again, and 
then once there are two-thirds of the votes, then the president 
must sign it. There were such cases in the past where the 
president vetoed a law and it went back to the parliament, and 
that proves that the president pays attention ....[pauses] Let 
me remind you that the problem of Electoral Law for instance was 
vetoed by the president and there was a big debate whether he 
can do it or not. The law was voted through anyway, and one must 
pay attention to how this influences the current situation, with 
this kind of political configuration. 
  [Woyciechowski] About Prime Minister Pawlak's Moscow visit. 
Is the president still surprised, and is he happy with the 
outcome of the visit? Has the prime minister presented a report 
yet? 
  [Drzycimski] I mean, as far as I know, the prime minister 
has not paid a visit to the president as yet. I mean, I know 
for sure that he has not seen him, but whether he has called him 
on the telephone -- as far as I know, he has not done so yet, 
unless he did it very recently, but as far as late last night is 
concerned, that did not happen. 
  The president was surprised by something else -- I mean 
generally he was aware of the visit -- but he was surprised that 
the prime minister failed to report to him personally on what 
the situation is, I mean in terms of the goal of the visit. 
When the prime minister goes on a foreign trip, political 
issues always come to the surface, and that is why the president 
stressed that when it comes to the supreme state agencies, there 
should be large-scale coordination. In every case concerning 
foreign policy, he has always consulted with Minister 
Skubiszewski -- it has never happened otherwise. And right now, 
he does the same with Minister Olechowski since the president 
thinks that of course he bears the constitutional responsibility 
for the general strategy as president, but when it comes to 
practical implementation, there is a specialized governmental 
agency to do that -- that is the Foreign Ministry which carries 
out the implementation. So the ministry knows about what is the 
best solution in terms of political configurations, timing, and 
selection of countries. That is very much observed by the 
president. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mr. Prime Minister -- I am sorry: Mr. 
Minister -- why did the prime minister not conduct any 
consultations? Did he just forget? Or did he rebel? 
  [Drzycimski] No, no, that was simply regarded a bit like 
....[pauses] Anyway, that was cleared up quickly. 
  [Woyciechowski] So he forgot? 
  [Drzycimski] It was regarded as something to be taken for 
granted. There is the ministry, and it transferred [sentence as 
heard]. But the president expects that in such situations, some 
mutual consultations be conducted, and this is even more so 
since the president always invites government representatives to 
participate in his every trip. I emphasize that he does not 
have to do that. 
  [Woyciechowski] The prime minister did not invite 
representatives of the president's office... 
  [Drzycimski, interrupting] No, that is not the problem. All 
I am saying is that the president wants everything that he takes 
care of in the state to be handled by specific ministries, 
specific ministers. They take, as it were, specific issues into 
their own hands and decide whether these or those solutions can 
be achieved. As a rule, the economic ministers are invited, but 
not only. In Ukraine, for example, the culture minister 
participated in the visit. It all depends on the character of 
the visit. However, the president always assumes that it is 
very good when there is close rapport between the president and 
the government, when there is no misunderstanding. The 
president believes that the government should see what the 
president discussed, which issues were tackled. Let us take the 
recent visit to India, for instance. The visit was rather 
scantily discussed by the Polish mass media; however, I must say 
that on that Indian subcontinent it really hit the headlines, 
both on television and in the press. During that visit the 
president was accompanied by three ministers: foreign affairs 
minister, industry minister, and foreign economic cooperation 
minister. Participating in the visit was also a group of ten 
entrepreneurs who represented the greatest commercial, economic 
centers which want to enter the Indian market, or which are 
already operating there. You know, there is an awareness that 
this is all conducted as a joint activity. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, how does the Belvedere 
evaluate the Moscow trip? Was it just a minor incident or have 
relations with Prime Minister Pawlak, which have so far been 
excellent, begun to deteriorate? 
  [Drzycimski] Do we think so? 
  [Woyciechowski] Yes. 
  [Drzycimski] No, certainly not. 
  [Woyciechowski] It was just a minor thing, was it not? 
  [Drzycimski] It was a technical issue, all the more so 
because, as I said, during the visit that the prime minister 
paid to the president a day before his departure, these issues 
were... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] They were explained? 
  [Drzycimski] Yes, they were explained. In addition, the 
prime minister presented very detailed main points of the visit; 
this was very important, because the prime minister decided that 
the visit and the talks should supplement the presidential 
agreements with specifics. This is what we really need: 
openness is everywhere, but we should get deeper into things, 
especially into the economic issues. I hear that a lot has been 
achieved in this area. I believe this will be a very important 
visit as it may open the Russian market. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, have you already read the 
68-page report by the National Council of Radio and Television? 
  [Drzycimski] No, I have not. This report is currently on 
the president's desk. I saw him going through it rather 
thoroughly. 
  [Woyciechowski] What will become of the council? What do 
you think? 
  [Drzycimski] The president delicately presented his stand. 
He presented his own remarks and concerns. As president, who 
feels responsible for what is happening in the country -- also 
responsible for the democratic transformations in the mass media 
-- he stated his views. He believed that certain decisions had 
been made too hastily; he did make that clear. It also seems 
that these issues will sooner or later be brought up again and 
again: Free mass media, free press, free radio, and free 
television. I believe that these issues will be brought up, 
that all the issues of social concern will be presented. The 
president had information which needed to be thought over. I do 
not... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] He recalled Markiewicz. Is he 
still certain that he had the right to do that? 
  [Drzycimski] Did he have the right? 
  [Woyciechowski] Yes. 
  [Drzycimski] This is one of the loopholes of the law, and 
the president brought the issue up -- he realized that the issue 
would come up sooner or later. He thought that this problem had 
to be resolved, so that future actions could be taken within a 
specified legal framework. It was a loophole; the president 
showed that; and now we are quietly waiting for the 
Constitutional Tribunal to make a decision. At any rate, 
generally the president believes that, whenever he has any 
doubts, he feels he must speak out. He has done so in many 
other cases, in many far more difficult cases. He has some 
doubts, his conscience compels him to present it all. Now, 
whether this will prove itself remains an open issue. He did 
signal the problem, he did bring it up at a moment when 
decisions were being made too hastily; he decided to recall the 
chairman because he believed that the issues needed to be 
examined quietly -- all the more so because, according to the 
president, the decisions were in great conflict with the Law on 
Radio and Television, which clearly states that one broadcaster 
cannot achieve a dominating position; however, it seemed that 
there was such a dominating position, because if one broadcaster 
receives both the satellite... [pauses] The nationwide 
television and regional stations, then, well, there is not much 
left for others. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, today and yesterday the 
issue of those three presidential deputy ministers started to be 
discussed again. Today's papers carry reports that most 
probably Mr. Siemiatkowski will very soon be appointed deputy 
minister of national defense. Can you confirm that? Is this... 
  [Drzycimski, interrupting] This is definitely an issue... 
[pauses] Generally, I want to recall, and I have already said 
that the president believes that if a minister is entrusted with 
the function of steering a ministry, then... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Then the minister selects his 
cooperators himself. 
  [Drzycimski] Then the minister selects his cooperators 
himself. Such positions cannot be filled in line with the 
so-called political-party system. That is one point. Second, 
if the ministries need to be strengthened, it is decided by the 
minister, who makes his decisions after examining not their past 
membership, but their professional skills and expertise. The 
president will always defend decisions made independently by 
ministers, not made under political pressure. 
  [Woyciechowski] In other words, we should not expect any 
important decisions today or tomorrow on the issue? 
  [Drzycimski, interrupting] I do not have any information on 
that. 
  [Woyciechowski] Another piece of information from today's 
press: The candidate of the Democratic Left Alliance for the 
post of deputy minister of internal affairs is Mr. Zbigniew 
Sobotko, or Sobotka, and Minister Milczanowski has not yet 
discussed that with the Belvedere. Do you know anything about 
that... 
  [Drzycimski, interrupting] This falls under the same rule; I 
am speaking now about the rule, not about persons. If the 
ministers decide that these are persons who are professionally 
able to... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Then the president will not 
object to that. 
  [Drzycimski] No, he will not. The president believes that 
it is an issue of decisions; however, he will keep stressing 
that the decisions are up to the ministers, who do not have to 
yield to political pressure. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, let us now briefly discuss the 
strikes. The Solidarity strikes. Today at 0830 [0730 GMT] 
Solidarity will begin picketing in front of the Sejm. Tomorrow 
Solidarity will hold talks with Prime Minister Pawlak. How do 
you evaluate the strike situation? 
  [Drzycimski] Well, we partly discussed that while talking 
about the budget. People had a right to expect certain things. 
That is their way of expressing concern, which will grow deeper. 
Therefore, both the government and Solidarity must attempt to 
find some solution. People's expectations were increased and so 
they must ask the question. Now, here is another, very 
important remark. The trade union role is to exert pressure; 
however, they must also remember that there is a certain limit 
that cannot be exceeded. Many years ago the president said that 
trade unions, in this case Solidarity, are just like good 
bacteria on a living organism: They are parasites, quote 
unquote; however, they must remember that they cannot destroy 
the organism they live in. That is, trade unions must put 
pressure, fight, keep reminding, submit demands, and so on. 
Those are their inalienable rights; it is the most fundamental 
right, which must be implemented. However, trade unions must 
also remember that there is a certain limit, which is called the 
condition of the state. That limit is hard to exceed. 
Therefore, it is important that union people and government 
representatives sit at the negotiation table jointly, so that a 
discussion can be conducted over what can be done and to what 
extent. It seems that the resolution of the problem is going in 
that direction. Nevertheless, I would like to stress very 
strongly that it has been caused by the election campaign, where 
something entirely different was promised and the people are 
entitled to make demands. 
  [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview. 
  [Drzycimski] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Bernt Conrad report: "The Picture of the Balkans Is Tragic </F>
and Grotesque"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The presidents of Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Slovenia, Kiro 
Gligorov and Milan Kucan, have called for resolute West European 
support for the young democracies in Central, Eastern, and 
Southeastern Europe. With a view to the turmoil of war in the 
former Yugoslavia, Gligorov says that a Balkanization of other 
European regions is imminent if the "Balkans are not 
Europeanized." 
  The two presidents were invited to the Rhine by the 
"European 
Dialogue Bonn," an association of leading politicians and 
journalists, to discuss the topic "The Road to Europe -- Too 
Many Conflicts?". In separate talks they explained later to FRG 
President Richard von Weizsaecker what they had elaborated on 
with Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth as the discussion leader. 
  Their basic substance was: "The present picture of the 
Balkans is tragic and grotesque. It is also a consequence of 
insufficient preparations and the inability to permit, under 
crossfire from different interests, the victory of the finding 
that in the closely intertwined relations of the modern world 
there is no longer room for local wars and that the aggressor's 
first step is checked." This formulation was used by Slovene 
President Kucan. Like him, Macedonian Gligorov also made it 
quite clear that the Serbs are responsible for the war. Both 
explicitly rejected a new division into spheres of interest as 
it might become possible by Russia's increasing activities in 
ex-Yugoslavia. 
  Gligorov appealed all the more urgently to his Greek 
neighbors to put, for their part, an end to the completely 
superfluous controversy with Macedonia, to lift the unjustified 
embargo, and to achieve a peaceful dialogue. "The problem of 
Macedonian-Greek relations is basically an irrational problem of 
an emotional nature. We depend on cooperation. We do not have 
territorial claims. We are immediately prepared to continue the 
negotiations on all questions without exception," the Macedonian 
president affirmed. 
  Both politicians claim for their countries a place with 
equal 
rights in the future joint Europe.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Csurka: We Are at Home!"] </F>
  [Text] The reason people want Laszlo Csucs, deputy 
chairman of Hungarian Television, to resign is to have another 
excluded Hungarian. It makes no difference whether the 
government is behind the events in the radio. However, if it is 
not, then it should be ashamed of itself, Istvan Csurka, 
cochairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP], said 
in his speech. According to estimates, at the MIEP's call some 
4,000-6,000 people gathered at Szabadsag Square [in Budapest] on 
15 March. 
  Csurka was welcomed with flags in national colors and Arpad 
stripes ["arpadsavos," neo-Nazi symbol] and banners saying "We 
want Hungarians in television and radio!" and "Cheers for 
Csucs!" In his speech, he said that since 1848, the front has 
been lying between Hungarianness and foreignness, and now, 
"foreign mercenaries have reoccupied the public." According to 
Csurka, the liars have preserved their positions and their goal 
is to "spread the Marxist-Leninist system over the people." In 
his view, international financial support is behind the 
nation-destroying attitude. "We must not be afraid now: We are 
the majority, we are at home, and we have greater love for the 
homeland," Csurka said in conclusion. 
  The crowd cheered Csurka and Csucs for a long time, while 
some people shouted unprintable abuse at two young people 
wearing blue ribbons [symbolizing protest against radio 
dismissals].

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister-designate Jozef Moravcik by </F>
Julius Gembicky in Bratislava on 15 March: "Consensus and a New 
Political Culture"] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- Shortly after Prime 
Minister-designate Jozef Moravcik had been officially entrusted 
by President Michal Kovac with forming a new broad coalition 
government, he granted his first interview to NARODNA 
OBRODA. 
  [Gembicky] Mr. Moravcik, the coalition method of government 
is demanding because various political entities will directly 
influence it or will enter into it. Some of the parties -- 
mainly the centrist ones -- do not yet have clear-cut policies, 
which may make things difficult for the future prime minister, 
not only in seeking a compromise but also in ensuring that the 
cabinet functions efficiently as a unit. In this context, some 
experts are wondering whether the new government will be able to 
function as a compact unit or whether it will be divided 
department by department in accordance with the strength of the 
political parties, movements, and factions that entered into it. 
In your opinion, what would be the most effective way of 
reducing this handicap? 
  [Moravcik] We have to place emphasis on forming a collective 
that is mutually compact. That means that we are not attaching 
importance to allegiance to individual parties and groupings but 
to ensuring that a homogeneous collective is formed, which would 
provide a guarantee that not only the real obstacles but also 
the diverse points of view will be overcome, that there will be 
unity, and that compromises will be sought. 
  [Gembicky] What mechanism for a coalition agreement among 
the ruling entities have you decided to embrace? 
  [Moravcik] The basis for this coalition mechanism is and 
will be consensus. I firmly believe -- and up to now we have 
always succeeded -- that we will achieve a consensus, although 
it seems rather unusual. However, it has a very important side 
effect. It will help to unite the very divergent or disunited 
entities on our political scene. That is extraordinarily 
important for Slovakia at the moment. If we succeed, we can lay 
the foundations for a new political culture, which would be a 
good sign for Slovakia's political future. 
  [Gembicky] What positive activities undertaken by the 
previous cabinet would you like to follow up on, what would you 
like to improve, and what would you like radically to change? 
  [Moravcik] In my opinion, what was positive about the 
previous cabinet was its industriousness and assiduousness. We 
would like to inherit these qualities. However, they should not 
be undermined by the lack of a concept. That means that we 
should see to it that a firm line is established and that stress 
is laid on its execution. We would definitely like to improve 
this. 
  [Gembicky] Following your naming as prime 
minister-designate, you emphasized economic recovery as a 
priority for making your government's activity more efficient. 
How will that be projected into the mechanism for the 
functioning of the government and for the considerable personnel 
changes in the crucial economic departments? 
  [Moravcik] The team of economic ministers will actually be 
completed in the next few hours. Those negotiations are the 
most demanding because we all feel that the composition of the 
team is the pivotal point of the entire strategy from which the 
new government wants to proceed and that it wants to present to 
the parliament in April in its policy statement. For that 
reason, the negotiations have not yet been completed and, in 
this sphere, we are much more interested in the expertise than 
the political allegiance of the candidates for the ministerial 
posts. 
  [Gembicky] Do you consider it essential -- and you 
personally, Mr. Moravcik -- for your government to be only a 
temporary one or would it not bother you if it were in office 
until the end of this electoral term? 
  [Moravcik] We will keep to the generally accepted political 
agreement. The concept for the new government's work is based 
on this and, according to it, elections must be held this fall 
at the latest. We have sufficient means for pushing for 
elections at the end of September or the beginning of October. 
This is, in our view, the optimum date and we want to do 
everything to ensure that it is adhered to. 
  [Gembicky] How do you view effective cooperation within 
the trio of the most senior constitutional officials -- the 
president, the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] 
chairman, and the prime minister? 
  [Moravcik] Regular meetings and an in-depth discussion on 
the most important issues before a decision is made is the basis 
for good cooperation. I think it could be a fundamental course 
of action that would guarantee the harmonization of cooperation 
and collaboration among the representatives of the 
aforementioned most senior constitutional institutions. 
  [Gembicky] On the basis of a political decision, however, 
the outgoing government refused to administer the affairs of the 
individual departments until a new government is appointed. 
What if NRSR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic, for instance, were to be 
governed by the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia's [HZDS] new 
political decisions and were to refuse to take part or if, as 
the case may be, he were to make effective cooperation in the 
president-parliamentary chairman-prime minister triumvirate 
difficult? 
  [Moravcik] At the moment, we are proceeding from the view 
held by those of us participating in the formation of the new 
government that as far as the National Council chairman is 
concerned, it is necessary to respect the fact that the HZDS has 
the strongest deputies' club. Therefore, we also intend to 
accept the fact that the chairman of the Slovak parliament is 
also from that club. Naturally, if cooperation were to be 
impeded and if it were necessary to alter this informal 
principle, then we have sufficient means for ensuring that we 
alter this situation. 
  [Gembicky] In your opinion, what kind of coordination should 
there be in foreign policy between the Castle, the government, 
and the Foreign Ministry, an area in which there have recently 
been, to a certain extent, glitches? 
  [Moravcik] I think that favorable prerequisites will now be 
created for ensuring that cooperation among all these 
constitutional entities is harmonized. I am well acquainted 
with the situation in the Foreign Ministry. My views on foreign 
policy are identical -- in the fundamental principles -- with 
those of the president. That is, there is a fundamental 
prerequisite for ensuring that our cooperation runs smoothly. 
Incidentally, this is merely a question of maintaining the best 
possible mutual connections, relations, and coordination. The 
means for doing so are in our hands.

  [Text] Prague, March 16 (CTK) -- Czech Prime Minister 
Vaclav Klaus told journalists on Wednesday [16 March] he could 
see no immediate reason to talk to Slovak Prime Minister Jozef 
Moravcik. 
  But he added that important negotiations on exports and 
imports of goods, particularly food, were to take place by the 
end of March. The talks need not have to be conducted by the 
premiers. They can be conducted by agriculture ministers or 
within the Customs Union Council, Klaus said. 
  On Czech Television tonight, Industry and Trade Minister 
Vladimir Dlouhy expressed interest in the new Slovak Government 
to be stable. He said he hoped the Czech and Slovak parties 
would find a common language at the March 28 session of the 
Customs Union Council in Bratislava and would succeed in finding 
ways of removing unnecessary technical obstacles to bilateral 
trade.

  [Text] Prague, March 17 (CTK) -- The Civic Democratic 
Party (ODS) does not in the least feel entitled to discuss the 
composition of the new Slovak Government, Czech Prime Minister 
and ODS Chairman Vaclav Klaus told journalists today. 
  He said the ODS fully respected Slovakia's sovereignty and 
independence and its new cabinet. 
  The Czech Republic considers Slovakia to be its primary 
partner and has an eminent interest in "smooth, good, and 
constructive relations with the Slovak Government," Klaus said. 
  He warned against the Czech Republic perceiving Slovakia as 
so- called "near abroad." Klaus explained that this term is 
appearing in the interpretation of Russia's politics which makes 
no difference between domestic affairs and foreign affairs. 
"They have invented the term "near abroad" in reference to 
former republics of the former Soviet Union which Russia seeks 
to treat differently than other foreign countries," Klaus 
elaborated.

  [Text] Prague, March 16 (CTK) -- Ukrainian Foreign 
Minister Anatoliy Zlenko arrived today for his first, two-day 
official visit to Prague. 
  He is to meet with his Czech counterpart Josef Zieleniec to 
initial a Czech-Ukrainian Treaty on Friendly Relations and 
Cooperation, and discuss relations between the two countries and 
international topics, including the building of a new European 
security structure. 
  On his arrival Zlenko told journalists that he had came to 
the Czech Republic to continue dialogue with Zieleniec on the 
creation of a legislative basis of Czech-Ukrainian relations in 
the new conditions, their prospects and European developments. 
  Zlenko also expressed his understanding for the Czech 
Republic's efforts at admission into NATO. However, during 
negotiations on the issue it is necessary to respect the 
interests of other countries as well, he stressed. He noted 
that Ukraine did not strive to join NATO, but saw the NATO 
mechanisms as a framework for possible cooperation in other 
areas. 
  Zlenko is also to meet with Czech President Vaclav Havel and 
Premier Vaclav Klaus. Oleh Slepichev, Ukrainian minister for 
external economic relations, is expected to meet with the 
ministers of industry and trade and of finance Vladimir Dlouhy 
and Ivan Kocarnik, respectively. 
  The Ukrainian and Czech officials are to sign two 
inter-government agreements: an agreement on scientific 
cooperation and an agreement on the promotion and mutual 
protection of investments.

  [Text] Prague, March 17 (CTK) -- The Czech and Ukrainian 
Foreign Ministers Josef Zieleniec and Anatoliy Zlenko initialed 
today a Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation between their 
countries. Zlenko ends today a two-day official visit to the 
Czech Republic. 
  At a press conference the two politicians appreciated the 
importance of the document which is yet to be affirmed on a 
higher level. The Treaty, as well as a Czech-Russian agreement 
on trade and economic relations and an agreement on scientific 
cooperation will be an inspiration for mutual relations. 
  Zlenko said that Czech-Ukrainian economic relations should 
be 
developed, as there existed still unexploited possibilities in 
this sphere. Ukraine will gladly draw from Czech experience 
from the transformation process, Zlenko said. 
  Zieleniec informed Zlenko that Ukraine was one of the Czech 
Republic's significant priorities. Stable Ukraine is also an 
important factor of stabilization in Central and Eastern Europe, 
he added. 
  Zieleniec said he was pleased by Zlenko's confirmation of 
continuing supplies of oil and gas via the Ukrainian territory, 
saying he was glad that the Ukrainian Government saw this 
question as an important part of Czech-Ukrainian relations. The 
two ministers also discussed sub-regional and regional 
cooperation and ways of ensuring security in Europe. 
  Zlenko also met with Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus. After the 
meeting, Klaus said that the Czech Republic was ready to send 
its economic experts to Ukraine if asked to. Zlenko said that 
Klaus had expressed his support for Ukrainian foreign political 
activities.

  [Text] Prague, March 17 (CTK) -- Disagreement with the 
recent statement by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev that 
Russia would like to have a certain specific status within the 
Partnership for Peace plan was pronounced at today's press 
conference given by the Czech and Ukrainian foreign ministers. 
  The Czech minister, Josef Zieleniec, said that the framework 
of the plan, which the Czech Republic signed only recently, 
should not change. In the opposite case new talks would be 
necessary. He added that the Czech Republic was satisfied with 
the current plan and did not consider any change feasible. 
  The Ukrainian minister, Anatoliy Zlenko, said he could only 
agree with Kozyrev that the plan was not a panacea. But he 
added that he believed that it was in the interest of all to 
have the same status. 
  Zlenko expressed Ukraine's wish to cooperate with the 
Visegrad Four (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and 
Slovakia). He said that such an important factor of European 
developments as Ukraine could well complement the group's 
activity. 
  Zlenko is ending a two-day visit to the Czech Republic 
today.

Czech government approved a bill on the Czech Republic's 
measures aimed against Libya, which would enable the Czech 
Republic to implement the UN Security Council's tightened 
sanctions against Libya, a government spokeswoman told CTK. 
  The UN sanctions against Libya have been in effect since 
December 1, 1993. The Security Council approved them on 
November 11, as Tripoli did not meet its demand to hand over two 
Libyan citizens accused of participation in the explosion of a 
U.S. aircraft over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988, in 
which 270 people lost their lives.

  [Text] Prague March 18 (CTK) -- The Immunology and 
Microbiology Institute based in Techonin, East Bohemia, has 
focused only on the defence research of the regulation of 
immunite reactions and of anti-viral and immunomodulative 
preparations, not on bacteriological weapons, Professor Josef 
Fusek told CTK today. 
  Fusek, the rector of the Military Medical Academy, to which 
the Techonin institute belongs, was reacting to articles 
published by the Czech press on Thursday [17 March] and today, 
according to which the institute developed dangerous species of 
bacteria and viruses destined for the production of biological 
weapons. 
  The right-leaning daily CESKY DENIK reports that such 
substances have been stored in several places in the Czech 
Republic. 
  "Biological weapons have never been developed, produced or 
stored here. The institute was not constructed for such 
activities. The institute has never been asked to do such 
work," Fusek said. 
  The Czech Republic has fulfilled -- without exception -- the 
convention which bound it not to develop, produce or store 
chemical weapons. The premises of the mentioned institute were 
opened to an international inspection in May 1990, he stressed. 
  Fusek also dismissed the allegation by CESKY DENIK that 
germs 
of cholera, plague and other dangerous substances were used in 
the institute. 
  The Czech Defence Ministry has not so far commented on the 
issue, which, according to a ministry spokesperson, will be 
taken up at a ministry press conference today.

  [Text] Prague, March 17 (CTK) -- The Czech Defense Ministry 
will not comment on today's press reports that dangerous strains 
of bacteria and viruses, which were to be used in the production 
of biological weapons, are stored at several localities in the 
Czech Republic, the Ministry has informed CTK. 
  According to the press, Czechoslovakia as a member of the 
former Warsaw Pact, was charged with the development of 
bacteriological weapons. They were allegedly developed at an 
undeground center of the Military Research Institute near 
Techonin, east Bohemia. The media claimed that the bacteria and 
viruses developed in Techonin had been hidden at various 
localities in the Czech Republic. 
  The press reports said that this not only contravened the 
Czech Republic's international commitments, because the country 
had signed the Geneva convention under which states undertake 
not to develop, use and store without international agreement 
biological weapons, but also threatened the public.

  [Text] Prague, March 17 (CTK) -- Czech and German Interior 
Ministry delegations agreed during their two-day talks on the 
wording of a long unresolved article in the readmission 
agreement, Czech Deputy Interior Minister Martin Fendrych, who 
led the Czech delegation in Germany, told CTK today. 
  The latest round of negotiations brought to an end two years 
of talks on the agreement governing return of illegal 
immigrants. If parliament now approves the document, Interior 
Minister Jan Ruml will sign it with his German counterpart, 
Fendrych said. Both sides hope the agreement can be signed by 
June this year. 
  The agreement provides for the establishment of an expert 
committee to oversee the proper implementation of the agreement, 
propose recommendations for the resolving of problems and 
suggest any necessary changes or additions to the original 
document. 
  The delegates agreed on a period of twelve months in which 
an 
immigrant can be returned to the country from which he (she) 
illegally crossed the Czech-German border into the destination 
country. It was also agreed that the German authorities have 
six months to find a refugee. "Informal" readmission can be 
undertaken within three days of the illegal immigrant crossing 
the border.

  [Text] Prague, March 16 (CTK) -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
should he visit the Czech Republic, should be treated at least 
like the Germans "who caused the death of 325,000 people during 
Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia and are visiting the Czech 
Republic unpunished," former Communist Party high-ranking 
official Miroslav Stepan said today. 
  Stepan, who is currently chairman of the People's Union of 
National and Social Salvation (LUNSZ), told journalists he 
considered it absurd for a "person from a friendly Slav country 
to come here with the handicap of being followed." He said that 
as LUNSZ chairman and as a Czech citizen he would watch 
Zhirinovskiy's views with interest and would "read between the 
lines." 
  Jan Vik, spokesman of the Assembly for the 
Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) which invited 
Zhirinovskiy to visit the Czech Republic, said today that no 
matter whether the visit took place in several days or later it 
would be very welcomed. Zhirinovskiy is a Russian 
ultra-nationalist and chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) which emerged victorious in the Russian parliamentary 
elections recently. 
  Stepan said that Zhirinovskiy had become a victim of an 
international information conspiracy. He said that a period of 
strengthening of pan-Slavic solidarity is approaching, so that 
"300 million Slavs not to find themselves in the position of 
nations subservient to overlord nations," the latter being the 
"advanced" states.

  [Text] Prague, March 16 (CTK) -- The Assembly for the 
Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) sees the 
statement by Jan Ruml concerning Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's planned 
visit to the Czech Republic as "an attack against the last 
remains of the democratic paint in our country". 
  During his south Moravian trip on Tuesday [15 March], Ruml, 
the Czech Interior Minister, said he intended to take all 
possible steps to prevent Zhirinovskiy, the leader of Russia's 
Liberal Democratic Party, from staying in the Czech Republic. 
He said he would push his intention through with the use of the 
law on foreigners' stay in the country. 
  A SPR-RSC statement given by a party spokesman to CTK today, 
says the SPR-RSC assures the government that Zhirinovskiy's 
visit to the Czech Republic will take place sooner or later. 
  "Ruml is not disturbed by the crowds of economic refugees 
from the world flowing to the Czech Republic and being nourished 
from our citizens' taxes. Ruml is not disturbed by foreign 
mafias' staying (in the country) and pursuing criminal 
activities...," the statement says. 
  It adds that Ruml is not even disturbed by trips of Sudeten 
German spokesman Franz Neubauer to the Czech Republic, towards 
which he is raising blatant claims. 
  "Not the stance of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy but that of Ruml 
can 
be called fascist, and it directly contravenes the proclaimed 
democracy and post-November (1989) ideas". 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said in Warsaw on March 14 that he 
would pay a visit to the Czech Republic on March 20-21. He has 
been invited by the extreme-right SPR-RSC.

  [Text] Prague, March 17 (CTK) -- The coalition Christian 
Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) insists 
on the necessity of conducting government coalition talks on 
fundamental political laws, including election legislation, 
KDU-CSL Chairman Josef Lux said on Thursday [17 March]. 
  He stressed that along with Jan Kalvoda, chairman of the 
coalition Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and head of the 
government's Legislative Office, he had asked that the 
government not discuss election bills before they were dealt 
with by the coalition. In spite of this the government dealt 
with the bills because Lux and Kalvoda had been outvoted by 11 
votes in the "coalition thirteen." 
  The coalition thirteen consists of the parliament chairman 
and deputy chairmen, the chairmen of the four coalition parties 
-- the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the ODA, the KDU-CSL and 
the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) -- and the chairmen of the 
parliamentary deputies' groups. 
  In February the government approved a bill on parliamentary 
elections. It has met with sharp criticism particularly from 
the ODA. It said that the ODS, the strongest government party, 
wanted to create one-mandate constituencies to ensure its 
dominance of the Senate, which is to be elected under the law. 
  Lux said today his party did not feel bound by the 
government's decision. He also dismissed the opinion of KDS 
Chairman Vaclav Benda, who said on Tuesday [15 March] that he 
would vote in favor of bad election bills rather than to be left 
without the laws. The failure to pass legislation would be a 
tragedy, he added. 
  "We are not voting for bad laws," Lux said today. 
  He also addressed the security situation in the Czech 
Republic, saying that the development of society, including 
economic transformation, was threatened by rising crime. 
  The KDU-CSL resolutely rejects the re-introduction of the 
death penalty, Lux stressed. He said the solution rested in 
prevention, in which a great role is played by a well 
functioning family. The party will seek ways of curbing the 
publicity given to brutality in the media, he added.

  [Text] Budapest, 16 Mar (MTI) -- AWACS surveillance 
aircraft patrolling the airspace of Hungary, among other 
countries, have a U.N. mandate to continually assist and monitor 
observance of the flying ban over Bosnia-Herzegovina. These 
planes are not directly involved in carrying out airstrikes, a 
NATO spokesman told MTI. 
  Brussels was responding to a group of Hungarian journalists 
reporting, on the basis of information from a high-ranking NATO 
general, that AWACS aircraft on duty in Hungary's airspace also 
had a part in the downing of four Bosnian Serb jets on February 
28. 
  (Hungarian Army commander Lieutenant-General Janos Deak 
stated in the March 2 issue of the daily MAGYAR NEMZET that 
there was no connection between NATO planes involved in the 
February 28 air battle and AWACS on a surveillance mission in 
Hungary that time.) 
  NATO sources, who requested anonymity, called attention to 
the basic difference between the defensive task of controlling 
the no-fly ban under a U.N. decision, and a possible offensive 
action like the airstrike threatened in NATO's February 9 
resolution, which finally did not take place. 
  As the U.N. resolution allowing AWACS to stay over Hungary 
applies only to the former case, participation of surveillance 
planes in offensive operations was necessarily out of the 
question. 
  The Hungarian Foreign Ministry's Press Department said in a 
statement sent to MTI on Wednesday evening: 
  NATO's AWACS aircraft have been patrolling Hungary's 
airspace 
for about one and a half years with the permission of Hungary's 
government based on a parliamentary resolution. Their exclusive 
task is to assist implementation of the U.N. Security Council's 
decisions Nos. 781, 816 and 836 by monitoring overflights of 
prohibited areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Accordingly, they are aiming to observe violations of the 
no-fly ban imposed by the U.N. Security Council. 
  The activity of AWACS planes was limited to this even during 
the February 28 events.

  [Text] Budapest, 17 March (MTI) -- "Hungary sees recent 
statements from Slovak Government circles positively both in 
content and tone, and is always keen to boost joint 
cooperation," said Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman on 
remarks by Slovakia's new Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik about 
closer links with Budapest. 
  Hungary would like to see rapid progress, following changes 
caused by the Gabcikovo hydroelectric dam in Slovakia, over 
sharing Danube water, which looks particularly urgent in light 
of the imminent growing period in Szigetkoz, when water is vital 
to plant growth. (While Hungary has already accepted the 
European Union's recommendation on water sharing, Slovakia has 
not yet done so.) 
  Also important to Budapest is the implementation of Council 
of Europe recommendations. (When Slovakia was admitted to the 
Council of Europe, it was asked to permit use of Hungarian town 
and village name-plates and registration of Hungarian family 
names.)

  [Text] Warsaw, March 16 -- Head of the Sejm Administration 
and Internal Affairs Committee Zbigniew Bujak (Union of Labour) 
said he was against the transformation of the internal 
ministry's Vistula region troops into a national guard 
subordinate to the president. 
  Bujak, addressing the committee meeting, argued that the 
transformation of the Vistula region troops into, as he put it, 
a presidential guard, would be "a dangerous shift on the 
political arena." He said that such a military unit may be 
"equally efficient in averting as well as in carrying out a coup 
d'etat." Bujak expressed the opinion that any kind of 
one-person control of a concrete political force over the 
Vistula troops poses a "threat of their misuse." A further 
discussion of committee members was held behind closed doors. 
  A draft law prepared by the National Security Bureau at the 
Presidential Chancellery and approved by the National Defence 
Committee last year, provided for the transformation of the 
Vistula troops into a national guard subordinate to the 
president. The idea caused much controversy, including protests 
from deputies and members of the parliamentary national defence 
committee. 
  Among tasks of the elite unit is the protection of 36 
government buildings and 130 foreign diplomatic missions in 
Poland and Polish diplomatic and consular missions in 16 states. 
  At present the unit, with 12,000 soldiers and civilian 
employees, is subordinate to the minister of internal affairs.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 17 -- In January Poland recorded a 
deficit in her foreign trade of 200 m dollars, and a slightly 
smaller deficit on her current account in the balance of 
payments (191 m dollars), according to data released Thursday by 
a Central Bank official. 
  Wlodzimierz Kicinski, head of the NBP's foreign department, 
told reporters that export earnings in January reached 1,054 bn 
dollars, up 21.6 percent on January, 1993, while payments for 
imports reached 1.25 bn dollars, up 10 percent on January last 
year. Poland's leading trade partners both in exports and 
imports were Germany, the United States, Britain, France and 
Austria. 
  Gross official reserves of foreign exchange reached 4.3 bn 
dollars in January, recording a slight increase on December, 
1993. 
  Yesterday the president of the State Foreign Investment 
Agency said he expected an inflow of foreign investment and loan 
capital to Poland as a result of the agreement signed by Poland 
with the creditor banks associated in the London Club. He put 
the expected inflow at 1 bn dollars annually. 
  In the last five years foreign investments in Poland 
totalled 
3.5 bn dollars.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 17/3/1994 -- "The necessity of 
one more step onto reform and democratization of the country was 
the reason for the recent government reshuffle, said Romanian 
Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu in an interview with the 
governmental daily VOCEA ROMANIEI. "Important changes have been 
made at the Defense Ministry and Interior Ministry where our 
major concern was to appoint civilians just as the old 
democracies do... Of course, we have thought also to the 
stability and credibility of these institutions... The 
appointment of a civilian to head the National Defense Ministry 
was also meant to shelter the Armed Forces from political 
infringements and ungrounded allegations. The Armed Forces must 
remain our main national support, the major trustee of Romania's 
territorial integrity," said the Romanian premier. 
  "The appointment of a civilian as defense minister was not 
imposed to us from outside... The council of Europe recommended 
it, they did not obligate us to do it... We have followed the 
practice in the majority of the democratic countries which have 
civilians as defense ministers. 
  "The new minister of the interior, a lawyer, will monitor 
closely the enforcement of the law and, not the least to 
mention, will speed-up the pace of the reform of the Interior 
Ministry departments... This move has been thought of also in 
point of the fight against corruption. We hope that the 
finalisation of the reform of the justice would mean another 
step forward in the fight against this plague," said Romanian 
Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 16/3/1994 -- "The espionage 
accusations brought against Lieutenant General Marin Pancea and 
carried by some Romanian publications over the past few days are 
pure concoctions and fabrications. Utterly groundless and 
fanciful correlations are being made with certain changes in the 
executive structures of the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI). 
The president of Romania cannot possibly be thought as due to 
react to such irresponsible absurdities, as it is rather the 
duty of those who launch them to substantiate their allegations 
with evidence and not by unproved assertions," says a press 
release from the presidential spokesman. 
  "The decree of the president of Romania ruling the 
discharging from the position of secretary of Romania's Supreme 
Defense Council of Lieutenant General Marin Pancea and his 
transfer to the reserve was signed and sent for publication to 
the official gazette. The signing of this decree has nothing to 
do with the recent speculations in the press, his transfer to 
the reserve corps having been decided a longer time ago," the 
press release runs.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 17/3/1994 -- The allegations of 
spying for France spelled out by a best-selling Romanian daily 
against Lieutenant-General Marin Pancea, secretary of Romania's 
Supreme Defense Council, provoked boisterous commentaries by the 
press and a categorical dismissal by the presidency. 
  The daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI headlined its front page on 
Monday [14 March]: "A reason to worry Romania's president: 
Lieutenant-General Marin Pancea, secretary of the Supreme 
Defense Council, is spying for the French secrete services." It 
elaborated: "The French had access to secrete information from 
the Supreme Defense Council delivered by General Pancea through 
a Romanian-born French citizen, Tudor Anescu, known by Romanian 
counter-intelligence as a two-way spy manipulated by the French 
counter-intelligence... On Monday, March 7, President Iliescu 
approved the retirement of General Marin Pancea and, during the 
same day, the director of the Romanian Intelligence Service 
(SRI), Virgil Magureanu, sacked the head of the 
counter-intelligence division, Major-General Gheorghe 
Diaconescu. Nevertheless, there is a connection between the two 
events of special relevance." 
  The daily ADEVARUL called for comments on telephone from the 
French Department for Territory Surveillance. An official whose 
identity was not made available to the Romanian daily replied: 
"I do not know what are you talking about but, in any case, 
with regard to what you are telling me about, we can neither 
confirm nor deny such an information." 
  General Pancea, cited by the daily CURIERUL NATIONAL, 
stated: 
"It is not that I only think but I am actually sure that all 
these information are fabricated and imagined by someone wishing 
to make a thriller out of it. It is not necessarily the daily 
which published this information, but I would rather say some 
interested groupings... They are altogether aberrations, 
informations imagined by someone not reliable, only to avoid 
calling that person insane... I believe there are some groupings 
or forces interested in weakening certain structures of the 
Romanian state, the Supreme Defense Council being one of them. 
They tend to strike not where the `effect' occurred but higher, 
on the presidency." 
  In a fax released to ROMPRES on Wednesday, Presidency 
Spokesman Traian Chebeleu stated: "The fact is that the 
accusations with espionage against General Pancea are pure 
fabrications and fiction. Links of the most aberrant kind are 
groundlessly imagined with some leading structures within the 
SRI. Romania's president cannot have the obligation to answer 
to such irresponsible fables, but rather the ones launching them 
should sustain their allegation with evidences and not through 
groundless affirmations." 
  The presidential decree concerning the release of the 
secretary of the Supreme Defense Council Lieutenant-General 
Marin Pancea from his office and his retirement from active duty 
has been signed and delivered to the official gazette for 
publication, the presidency spokesman said. "The signing of 
this decree has nothing to do with the recent days' allegations 
by the press. General Pancea's retirement had been considered 
long time ago," reads the presidency spokesman's statement.

<F P=106> [From the 16 March Romanian press review] </F>
  [Excerpt] Bucharest ROMPRES, 16/3/1994 -- "Irredentist 
Fangs in Bucharest and in Transylvania" is the headline in daily 
ADEVARUL of the set of reports on the observance of the 
anniversary of the 1848 revolution by the ethnic Hungarian in 
Romania. The matter is covered by all newspapers that emphasize 
the attempt of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania 
[UDMR] Deputy Imre Borbely to make an address in Hungarian in 
Romania's Parliament. "To speak Hungarian before the Chamber of 
Deputies means an official offense to the country and to the 
fellow parliamentarians," writes daily CRONICA ROMANA, noting 
that "this characteristic rudeness of Mr. Borbely, a UDMR 
hardliner, (...) serves only those accused of nationalism (...) 
and we must admit that in such situations they are right, 
because one needs not be a nationalist to feel offended in one's 
own home, in one's own country, and in one's own parliament." 
  Daily ORA covers the visit paid to Transylvania by high 
state 
officials of Hungary in order to celebrate together with the 
Hungarian minority there the memory of the 1848 revolution. 
"The Hungarian Government's gesture to celebrate at high level 
the event that was a happy one for them and a tragical one for 
us, is impolite and this is an understatement (...). It is 
offending the Romanians' feelings" daily ORA writes. "The 
Hungarian revisionism is behaving as if the Hungarian empire 
existed, temporarily subjected to different, unjust laws, but 
still an empire, consequently the government has to participate 
in the festivities in its eternal provinces, irrespective of the 
present situation (...) The Hungarian revisionism tries in 
every possible way [to achieve] Romania's isolation from the 
community of European states. In an isolated Romania, subject 
to the quarantine of civilization, the difficult mission has 
been assumed by the UDMR. In Romania's Parliament there is a 
party hostile to Romania, that despises the Romanian nation."

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 16/3/1994 -- Romania's 
President Ion Iliescu received Wednesday, March 16, Ukraine's 
Minister Of Defense Vitaliy Radeskyy, currently in Romania at 
the invitation of his Romanian counterpart Gheorghe Tinca. The 
guest saluted the Romanian head of state on behalf of Ukraine's 
President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  The good relations between the Ministries of Defense of the 
two countries were pointed together with the wish of both 
Romania and Ukraine to further them. The parties referred to 
the agreement that was going to be signed on March 17 by the 
ministers of defense of the two countries. 
  An examination of the stage of the relations between Romania 
and Ukraine pointed to ways and the common wish to develop them 
further, to the interest of the two peoples. 
  Ukraine's Minister of Defense Vitaliy Radeskyy also had on 
Wednesday, 16 March, a meeting with the chief of the Romanian 
diplomacy, Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, who seized the 
opportunity to stress the importance Romania attaches to its 
relations with the Ukraine. 
  The sides pointed out the contribution the two countries 
could bring to enhancing security and stability in this part of 
Europe, which is confronted with special historical issues and 
momentary hardships. The sides underlined that, besides the 
Euro-Atlantic integration as prime objective, the creation of a 
favorable regional climate was an important complementary factor 
in the process. 
  In a different line of ideas, aspects of the partnership for 
peace were discussed, as well as the Ukraine's participation in 
the peace-keeping forces deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
situation of the Black Sea fleet, and other international issues.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 17 (CTK) -- The Slovak parliament 
today unanimously passed a constitutional law providing for 
calling early elections on September 30-October 1. The law was 
approved by all the 149 deputies present. The parliament has 
150 seats. 
  The regular elections were to be held only in 1996. The 
early elections are expected by optimists to produce a more 
lasting solution to Slovakia's political instability. 
  The government crisis was solved within five days since the 
parliament passed a vote of no confidence in former Prime 
Minister Vladimir Meciar, when the former opposition succeeded 
in forming a new cabinet under Jozef Moravcik. 
  Uncertainty has characterized the situation in the country 
practically since the June 1992 elections because Meciar's 
victorious Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) has failed 
to ensure a parliamentary majority. Moreover political 
squabbling was absorbing forces necessary to solve the 
deteriorating economic and social situation. 
  The autumn date was also supported by the new opposition led 
by ex-Prime Minister Meciar after their proposal to hold 
elections at the beginning of summer failed. The drive to 
collect a sufficient number of signatures to a petition on 
calling a referendum on holding elections without delay, on the 
mandates of "errant" parliamentary deputies and on the "purity" 
of the money used in privatization has also failed. 
  The new government and the new coalition will have to face 
for more than half a year the deteriorating problems of the 
country and the harsh election campaign. 
  This will be followed by a decision on Slovakia's further 
orientation and a verdict on a possible second "resurrection" of 
ex- Prime Minister Meciar who undoubtedly played the main role 
in the creation of independent Slovakia. 
  It was the methods and results of his rule that unified the 
post- communist left, the right-orientated Christian democrats 
and the "dissidents" from Meciar's HZDS who are seeking their 
place in the middle of the political spectrum, and enlisted the 
former opposition's support of the Hungarian coalition -- 
Egyutteles and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement 
(MKDH). 
  In reaction to today's vote in parliament, Jan Slota, 
chairman of the Slovak National Party (SNS) which had formed the 
ruling coalition with the HZDS, said "we had to support the date 
(for early elections as proposed by the new government 
coalition) because the president (Michal Kovac) marred the 
referendum." But he added that he thought that the president 
would prevent the referendum "even if we had 6,000 valid 
signatures." 
  Olga Keltosova, former Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, 
said that "elections are the only democratic way of bringing 
somebody to power." She was apparently hinting to the way of 
creation of the new government which the present opposition 
deputies call illegitimate.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 17 (CTK) -- "I would never have 
dreamed it could happen," Chairman of the Democratic Left Party 
(SDL) Peter Weiss said shortly after the surprising result of 
today's election date vote in parliament, which unanimously 
approved a date at the end of September and the beginning of 
October. 
  "I was only expecting a few of the deputies from the 
Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) to support the law on 
shortening the electoral period. It was the most beautiful 
parliamentary game in the history of Slovakia," Weiss said. 
  He added that he would like to believe that this was the 
germ 
of an election campaign which would not be a hate-filled 
struggle between political personalities, but would be a correct 
and proper competition of manifestos on how to lead Slovakia out 
of its crisis. 
  Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) Deputy Frantisek 
Miklosko 
said the voting was a clear signal that HZDS deputies, after the 
lack of success of their referendum petition (which was found 
not to contain enough proper signatures) had understood that 
calling an election through a referendum was no longer possible, 
and clearly did not have the strength to do so either. Thus 
they had chosen the strategy of deciding on one of the dates put 
forward after all, he said. 
  Chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement 
(MKDH) Bela Bugar said it was good that the question of early 
elections was being solved in a constitutional way. This was 
the most simple and cheapest solution, he said. Another way, 
such as approving a proposal to call a referendum, would cost a 
lot of money. 
  Milan Knazko, chairman of the Alliance of Democrats of the 
Slovak Republic (AD SR) said he believed that for the deputies 
of the former government coalition this was the last possibility 
of achieving early elections. All that they had tried to do 
before was their usual "variety politics," including the 
referendum, in which (judging from the inauthentic petition 
signatures) even fairy-tale beings would take part. 
  Knazko said he hoped that by the elections his party would 
be 
able to create a stable liberal right-of-centre bloc with 
Ludovit Cernak's National Democratic Party and Moravcik and 
Roman Kovac's Democratic Union of Slovakia. 
  Chairman of the preparatory committee of the National 
Democratic Party Ludovit Cernak said he thought that the 
Meciarites had made a proper assessment of the consequences of 
not supporting the election date proposal. Refusing it would 
have meant a fiasco for them; they were trying to limit the 
damage. 
  Cernak said he was glad that, in spite of their huge 
differences, Slovak deputies had sent the world a signal that 
there were things they knew how to agree on. However, he did 
not think the Meciarites could be said to have turned over a new 
leaf, as they were still fiercely oppositional in their 
behaviour. "There was no whistling in the Slovak parliament for 
two years; now there is. Nonetheless, I am glad that the first 
step is behind us," Cernak said.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 17 (CTK) -- Slovak President 
Michal Kovac's Office today said it considered the accusation by 
the Petition Committee that it "has desecrated the sacred 
constitutional, human and natural right of citizens to 
referendum" deplorable. 
  On Wednesday [16 March], the President's Office said that a 
referendum through which the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS) wanted to solve the question of early elections, the 
validity of the mandates of the deputies who have switched 
parties and the "origin" of the money used in privatization, 
would not take place since the 350,000 signatures, which 
according to the Slovak constitution are needed for the 
president to call a referendum, were not collected. 
  The Office said that out of more than 420,000 signatures 
collected only 233,000 were valid. This statement provoked 
anger on the part of the Petition Committee established by the 
HZDS of former Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar. 
  In a statement given to CTK today, the President's Office 
said that Kovac would violate the constitution if he called a 
referendum without 350,000 valid signatures. 
  While checking the validity of the petition sheets the 
President's Office proceeded in harmony with the law on 
petitions and it considers the accusation of the illegal 
interpretation of some of its provisions untrue, deliberate and 
non-trustworthy, the statement says.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 17 (CTK) -- "Although I consider 
relations between Slovakia and the Czech Republic good, they can 
be further improved," new Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan 
said at a press conference today. This improvement can be 
achieved primarily through the completion of the division of 
"the small percentage of remaining common property," Kukan said. 
  "It is in the interests of Slovakia to do its utmost so that 
Slovak-Czech relations also develop positively in the future, 
Kukan said. [no closing quotation marks as received] 
  He said that the current priorities of the Slovak foreign 
policy remained unchanged. They were first of all orientation 
towards an integration into European structures, including 
security ones, and the improvement of relations with neighboring 
countries, especially with Hungary. Here there exists a certain 
tension, Kukan said. 
  Slovakia is naturally interested in maintaining good 
relations with Russia, Ukraine and other East European 
countries. "These are important countries, they have their 
indisputable importance in the whole mosaic of international 
relations. I intend to attach considerable importance to 
relations with these countries given the traditions and economic 
weight of these countries," Kukan said. 
  Asked by CTK whether he intended to try to ensure that 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Slovakia, 
which was recently postponed, took place as soon as possible, 
Kukan said that "given its interest in promoting good relations 
with Russia, Slovak diplomacy will take necessary initiative for 
Kozyrev's visit to take place. 
  "We should strive for Slovakia to be perceived by the world 
objectively, much more objectively than before," Kukan said, 
adding that the U.S. press, for example, writes about Slovakia 
largely negatively. 
  Kukan confirmed the United Nations' interest in sending 
further Slovak troops to the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] in 
the former Yugoslavia. He said this would contribute to 
improving Slovakia's image abroad, but said that in the opinion 
of the Slovak Defense Ministry the "current 606 Slovak soldiers 
in Bosnia was the maximum that Slovakia could currently provide. 
  Kukan denied that the current change of government had 
harmed 
Slovakia's reputation abroad. Changing a cabinet which had lost 
its majority in parliament was a "normal phenomenon" in the 
advanced world, he said. International political circles in 
fact saw the approach of the Slovak parliament and President 
Michal Kovac to ending the power of Premier Vladimir Meciar's 
government as proof of the fact that democratic institutions and 
principles were working in Slovakia, Kukan said.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 17 (CTK) -- At a news conference 
of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) on Thursday [17 
March], the KDH members of the new Slovak Government introduced 
themselves and presented their immediate plans. The five 
members are: Deputy Prime Minister for Legislative Affairs Ivan 
Simko; Minister of Employment, Social Affairs, and the Family 
Julius Brocka; Minister of Transport, Communications, and Public 
Works Mikulas Dzurinda; Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner; and 
Culture Minister Lubo Roman. 
  Simko emphasized that even though the current cabinet's 
mandate is limited in time, he did not intend to merely "sit 
out" the term, but rather to foster new type of politics based 
on broad cooperation among all political forces, and to 
transform and oversee the legal system. 
  Brocka described himself as "minister of the poor" in charge 
of a large group of people who are socially disadvantaged. But 
by amending a number of laws he intends to protect others as 
well, he said, such as by creating tax breaks for self-employed 
people in order to make possible an increase in activity. 
  Dzurinda said he intended to transform and improve the 
country's transport and telecommunications infrastructure, and 
to revive certain billion-crown projects dating from the 
government of KDH Chairman Jan Carnogursky, who was Slovak 
premier from the fall of the first Meciar government in March 
1991 until the creation of the second one in June 1992. 
  Pittner said his goal was to improve the work of the police, 
do away with the insecurity and passivity which have recently 
been a trademark, and introduce modern and effective methods for 
fighting both common and organized crime. "We will respond to 
violence with violence within the spirit of the law," he said. 
  Roman said he wanted "to create a model for cooperation in 
culture, to convince people that cooperating with me will pay 
off, and to carry this model over to all of society." Specific 
projects he would like to see include creating sources of 
financing for construction of a theater in Kosice, East 
Slovakia, and holding a lottery to raise money for a new 
building for the Slovak National Theater.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 17 (CTK) -- The production of 
arms in Slovakia has been curbed to such an extent, that one 
cannot even speak of the restructuring of the arms industry, 
Economy Minister Peter Magvasi told CTK today. 
  Economic recovery must begin with engineering industry, the 
foundation of which was arms production, he said. It is 
necessary to draw up a production program for exportable goods 
based on existing structures, he went on. 
  "The problem of re-expanding arms production is so complex 
that it is more than illusory to speak of producing new defense 
systems," he emphasized. 
  The problem of Slovak arms producers' indebtedness was 
resolved last year by granting loans funded by the National 
Property Fund and from commercial bank reserves, but it is 
difficult for arms producers to find new creditors, Magvasi 
explained. 
  As for the firm Armex, founded by Meciar's government and 
specializing in arms trade, there exist in Slovakia more 
qualified and capable companies involved in the same activities, 
he said. Armex's activities will have to be re-evaluated in the 
context of the government's new economic policy, Magvasi said. 
  The government decides who can participate in deals on arms 
exports by requiring that arms exporters obtain licenses, he 
said, adding that he did not want to favor any particular firm. 
Obviously, most arms producers are still state property, Magvasi 
added.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 17 (CTK) -- New Finance Minister 
Rudolf Filkus today spoke about how the government would resolve 
the "three suicidal steps" that were forecast for the new 
government a few weeks ago. 
  Filkus said that currency devaluation was a matter for the 
Slovak National Bank alone, and that the government should not 
interfere. 
  The second step is the restrictive measures in the social 
sphere, upon which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) makes 
conditional the provision of credit. 
  Filkus spoke about the need to show to the outside world 
that 
the new government's actions would introduce political and 
economic stability. Until then it is possible to consider new 
discussions with the IMF with the aim of moderating the impact 
of the restrictions on the general population. 
  The third step is to begin discussions about the revision of 
the general tripartite agreement, and to look for ways to 
augment state income. The notorious 50 billion koruna (about 
$1.7 billion) state debt requires enormous interest payments 
which worsen the budget deficit still further. 
  Filkus said he saw income reserves mainly in the control of 
taxes and tariffs, adding that he did not yet have the necessary 
"prescription." 
  He also mentioned the hitherto ineffective import surcharge, 
which although having "cleansed the market for Slovak producers" 
had not succeeded in saturating the market with local products.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 17 (CTK) -- Milan Janicina, the 
new minister for the administration of national property and 
privatization, has promised to change privatization decisions 
made during the last few days of the previous government. 
  According to the Bratislava press, Meciar's government at an 
extraordinary meeting last Friday [11 March] approved with 
lightening speed nine privatization projects, including one for 
the lucrative spa of Piestany in west Slovakia. Similarly the 
cabinet agreed to almost thirty privatizations through direct 
sale in the second half of February, when the threat of the 
government's fall hung in the air. 
  "Privatization in Slovakia almost stopped in 1992, but from 
February 15 began to proceed very quickly," said Janicina in a 
radio interview, "until I got the impression that the same thing 
was happening as when William the Conqueror invaded Britain and 
handed out properties to his loyal Normans." 
  "I have the feeling that it is a form of political 
corruption. It is necessary to stop these sales. Fortunately 
there are not so many of these cases that it isn't possible to 
correct them in a couple of days," he continued. 
  During his tenure until the autumn elections the new 
minister 
intends to carry out privatization in accordance with the law in 
order to renew confidence both here and abroad, reconsolidate 
the situation at the ministry, and prepare the conditions for 
starting the second wave of coupon privatization. 
  According to hitherto officially unconfirmed information, 
Meciar's government last Friday approved privatization projects 
for: Chemosvit Svit; Paliva Skalica; Slovenske liecebne kupele 
Priestany; part of Interhotel Bratislava; part of 
Zapadoslovensky ZDROJ; Polygraficke zavody Trnava, Kovohuty 
Krompachy, VAP Presov. It also agreed a change to the approved 
project concerning VSZ Kosice. 
  At the center of attention is the Piestany spa, with assets 
of 1.6 billion korunas. A fifty-percent share was obtained by a 
limited liability company whose agent is the spa's director 
Gajdos, and whose silent partner is the ex-minister for health 
Viliam Sobona. The first instalment payment was fixed at 87 
million korunas. Last year the spa made a profit of 180 million 
korunas.

  [Text] Tirana, March 17 (ATA) -- "The Yugoslav Government 
will not allow the return of the permanent CSCE mission unless 
Yugoslavia will be an equal member of this organization," Margit 
Savovic, acting minister for human rights and minorities 
questions of the so-called Federal Yugoslav Republic declared at 
a press conference. The declaration followed a CSCE request for 
the installation of CSCE missions in Kosova, Sandjak and 
Vojvodina. It added that "Yugoslavia cannot allow to be a 
subject to carry out decisions which it has not approved. It 
doesn't mean that special missions are not allowed to come, but 
on the condition that it must be stressed that they are coming 
to Yugoslavia and not to Kosova, Vojvodina or Sandjak." 
  Ms. Savovic said that they also do not accept the proposal 
of 
an independent Swedish foundation that a civil UN administration 
be installed in Kosova due to human rights violations in the 
territory. She considered this act as "an attempt to 
internationalize the Kosova question and to impose a UN 
protectorate on Yugoslavia".

External Economic Relations Oleh Slepichev and Czech Trade and 
Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy today signed an agreement on 
economic cooperation between their two countries. He also 
signed an agreement on the support and mutual protection of 
investments with Czech Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik. 
  Dlouhy told reporters he considered important that the Czech 
Republic should sign accords adjusting mutual commercial 
relations with all successor states to the Soviet Union 
corresponding to the regulations of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. 
  A Finance Ministry spokeswoman told CTK the Czech Republic 
was bound by 16 accords signed before the Czechoslovak 
Federation split (on 1 January 1993) and it automatically 
assumed all the responsibilities resulting from them. 
  Since the split, the spokeswoman said, the Czech Republic 
has 
signed a further ten accords, which are not yet in force. The 
countries concerned are Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, 
Ukraine, Tajikistan, Thailand, Australia, Portugal, and Egypt. 
  Slepichev is a member of the Ukrainian delegation led by 
Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and scheduled to leave the 
Czech Republic this afternoon.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 17 March (MTI) -- After reaching a 
cease-fire in Sarajevo and an agreement on the Croatian-Muslim 
confederation, the next step towards peace is starting talks 
with Serbia, Vice-President [Presidency member] Ejup Granic told 
MTI correspondent on Thursday [17 March]. 
  Granic felt the Serbian side should accept two 
preconditions: 
Withdrawal from the occupied territories and permitting trials 
of suspected war criminals. The Serbs should be obliged by the 
international community to start negotiations, the 
vice-president said. Slobodan Milosevic's rule over Serbia is 
not strong enough to resist the world's will for ever, he 
believed. 
  Granic ruled out a politically restored federal Yugoslavia 
yet felt successor states might grow closer again economically 
in a few years' time.

  [Text] Zagreb, March 16 (MTI) -- Hungarian Foreign Minister 
Geza Jeszenszky met Croatian counterpart Mate Granic in Zagreb 
to sign a cooperation pact on Wednesday [16 March]. Jeszenszky 
said the agreement was "witness to the reconciliation and 
alliance of two nations." It lets them rebuild a centuries-old 
cultural tie, helping ethnic Croats in Hungary and Hungarians in 
Croatia, he added. Granic stressed how Croatian Hungarians had 
helped Croatian freedom struggles. 
  Jeszenszky also met President Franjo Tudjman and Prime 
Minister Nikica Valentic. Jeszenszky welcomed the Muslim-Croat 
agreement. 
  He said Serb promises during his January Belgrade visit 
still 
remained promises, with no major gains for Hungarians in 
Vojvodina. "But, it may be because measures justly expected by 
the Hungarian minority depend on a new Serb government forming," 
he added. 
  Jeszenszky later visited the aid-consignment store in 
Jankomir, and presented HUF [Hungarian forints] 6 million relief 
from the Hungarian Government. Much of the medicine and food 
will go to Bosnian Muslims. 
  Jeszenszky went to a March 15 celebration of Croatia's 
Hungarian Democratic Community. He goes to Sarajevo on Thursday 
morning.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 17 March (MTI) -- Hungarian Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszenszky arrived in Sarajevo this morning, the 
first member of the Hungarian Government visiting the 
Serb-besieged Bosnian capital. 
  The minister and his group were taken to the Sarajevo 
Presidential Palace in the armored tanks of UN peacekeepers to 
have talks with Bosnian Vice-President [Presidency member] Ejup 
Ganic, Foreign Minister Irsan Ljubijankic, as well as Arif 
Smajkic, minister responsible for refugees and social welfare. 
  Hungary supports a canton system in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Long-suffering Sarajevo could show the world an example of how 
people can live together in peace, despite different national 
and religious backgrounds, Jeszenszky said. 
  Lubijankic thanked Jeszenszky for the visit and expressed 
the 
Bosnian government's willingness to expand interstate 
cooperation. 
  After official talks, Jeszenszky met representatives of 
Sarajevo's 300-strong Hungarian community, mostly connected with 
the university there, and handed over some of the aid sent for 
the Humanitarian Association of Hungarians in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 17 (MTI) - "NOBODY [capitals as 
received] should think that Hungary has changed its policy on 
the South Slav [Yugoslav] region. We still strive to create 
good-neighbourly links and help ethnic Hungarian minorities get 
the institutional frameworks they need to survive," Hungarian 
Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said on Thursday. 
  On his Sarajevo visit, Jeszenszky said peace talks would be 
more successful if held in Sarajevo, since the different sides 
would also be prompted emotionally towards reconciliation by the 
sight of suffering people and destroyed buildings. 
  "People in Sarajevo would have already starved in tens of 
thousands had Europe not helped, but the same Europe cannot 
arrange a lasting settlement," said the foreign minister. 
Everyone has an interest in the Balkans not becoming a new 
Lebanon, he added. 
  Jeszenszky restated Hungary"s principal position of not 
participating even as peacekeepers in conflicts affecting its 
neighbours. There are Hungarians in Serbia, and anything could 
be misunderstood. Requests from both Bosnian Croats and Muslims 
would have to be considered by Parliament, Jeszenszky said.

  [Text] Sofia, March 14 (BTA) -- Since the beginning of the 
crisis in the former Yugoslavia Bulgaria has been consistently 
supporting all initiatives of the United Nations, NATO, the 
European Union and other international institutions seeking a 
lasting and just solution of the crisis, the Bulgarian Foreign 
Ministry says in a declaration today. 
  The solution of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina is of key 
importance in overcoming the overall crisis on the territory of 
the former Yugoslavia. There are good prospects for restoring 
peace through establishing a federative and confederative 
structure. The growing role of European and international 
institutions, of the United States and Russia is an expression 
of the resolution of the international community to put an end 
to bloodshed in a European country of the 20th century, the 
declaration reads. 
  Here it would be relevant to stress the important role of 
the 
UN peace-keeping forces. At the same time the Bulgarian Foreign 
Ministry would like to recall once again Bulgaria's appeal to 
the Balkan states to refrain from sending their armed forces in 
solving the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. Decisions on 
this issue should take into account both the need for increasing 
the strength of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] at present 
and the region's stability in the future. 
  The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry declares once again that the 
Republic of Bulgaria will not take direct or indirect part in 
military operations on the territory of the former Yugoslavia.

police in Ivaylovgrad (in southern Bulgaria, near the border 
with Greece), detained two diplomats from the French Embassy in 
Bulgaria. Ivaylovgrad falls in the border zone and the two 
diplomats' presence there without the permission of Bulgaria's 
Foreign Ministry is a gross violation of border regulations. 
  The police do not know how the two diplomats reached 
Ivaylovgrad unimpeded. A protocol was drawn up and they left 
for Sofia.

  [Text] Sofia, March 17 (BTA) -- The Independent Public 
Committee on National Problems met today to discuss the 
predicament of Bulgarians living in the Western Outlands, a 
territory awarded to Serbia under the 1919 Treaty of Neuilly. 
The meeting was attended by representatives of the Democratic 
Union of Bulgarians in Yugoslavia. The Committee adopted a 
declaration saying that the Bulgarian state is entitled and 
obliged to take care of and protect Bulgarians outside Bulgaria, 
to help them preserve their lifestyle, culture, language and 
national identity. While showing the will for good-neighbourly 
relations, the Bulgarian state authorities and the entire public 
cannot pass over in silence certain facts related to 
assimilation processes and human rights abuses in the Western 
Outlands, the declaration says. 
  A Western Outlands National Fund was established to provide 
material support for the promotion of the Bulgarian spirit and 
identity in the area. 
  It is an alarming fact that the number of Bulgarians in that 
area is diminishing, the public figures found. According to 
official statistics, Bulgarians there numbered 63,000 in 1960, 
and the 1991 figure was a mere 25,000. Migration motivated by 
unemployment and misery is depopulating the area but, along with 
that, carefully orchestrated processes unfold to eliminate the 
national identity of Bulgarians there, the committee members 
claim. 
  The Bulgarian language is not studied or is studied only 
partially as a foreign language. Books and newspapers in the 
mother tongue are not available, church services are not 
conducted in Bulgarian, areas with an all-Bulgarian population 
are administratively separated and joined to Serbian-populated 
areas. Monuments of Bulgarian culture and history are demolished 
or their national character is altered. 
  The Independent Committee insists that the state authorities 
take the necessary action to establish a free trade area in the 
Western Outlands and liberalize cross-border clearance to a 
degree providing opportunities for free movement. According to 
the Committee, the Bulgarian language must be studied in 
compliance with the national minority status which the Bulgarian 
population in the area enjoys, and Bulgarian teachers must be 
sent there. The necessary action must also be taken to conduct 
church services in Bulgarian and agree on unobstructed access of 
Bulgarian books and newspapers and reception of Bulgarian radio 
and TV programmes.

  [Text] Sofia, March 17 (BTA) -- Foreign Minister Stanislav 
Daskalov had a meeting with the ambassadors of the European Free 
Trade Association member states in Sofia, BTA was told by the 
spokesman for the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry. 
  The sides discussed the possibility of activating Bulgaria's 
economic relations with the EFTA countries. The meeting of the 
Bulgaria-EFTA committee, to be held in the first half of the 
year, is considered to be very important in this respect. 
  Attention was paid to the serious difficulties Bulgaria's 
economy faces as a result of the application of sanctions 
against Serbia-Montenegro. 
  Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov received British 
Ambassador Richard Thomas and Italian Ambassador Agostino Matis. 
The ambassadors familiarized Mr. Daskalov with the initiative 
for expanding the political dialogue with the six Central and 
Eastern European countries associated with the European Union, 
launched by the governments of Britain and Italy and approved by 
the EU. It is the sides' shared opinion that the initiative is 
an important moment within the context of expanding cooperation 
between the EU-associated countries and the EU. 
  Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov met the ambassadors of 
the EU member-states in Sofia. The sides discussed Bulgarian-EU 
economic relations, the preparations for the meeting of the 
Bulgarian-EU committee to be held next week in Sofia, and 
completing the formalities concerning the ratification of 
Bulgaria's Europe Agreement. The Bulgarian side expressed its 
desire for bringing the visa regulations of the EU states in 
line with the decisions for expanding cooperation with the 
countries in Central and Eastern Europe.

  [Text] Sofia, March 11 (BTA) -- I'd rather have the 
officers and sergeants discontented with the punishment I 
imposed on them than allowing the spread of the delusion that 
the army's problems can be resolved by putting pressure on 
parliament and the government, Defence Minister Valentin 
Aleksandrov told the MP's in reply to an MP's question on the 
day of parliamentary control. An MP for the Bulgarian Socialist 
Party asked the defence minister if some destabilization of the 
Bulgarian Army could be expected after some ten days ago part of 
the members of the Rakovski Officers Legion launched a sign-in 
for an address to the Ministry of Defence and parliament setting 
out their demands; the officers who signed the address were 
disciplined. 
  The sign-in campaign is not a revolt against the Ministry of 
Defence as the press wrote, Mr. Aleksandrov said. In his 
opinion, the case is a reflection of the army's actual problems 
which have been raised and discussed more than once. The 
officers' major demand, out of 21, is unacceptable, Minister 
Aleksandrov said. It is for a budget appropriation of 37 
billion leva for the army in 1994; under the National Budget Act 
which Parliament already passed, the army is allocated 12 
billion. The 1994 Budget Act is already a fact and there is no 
room in the army for those who do not want to comply with it, 
the defence minister said. As to the other demands, Mr. 
Aleksandrov admits that "though disputable and badly worded, 
they are grounded to some extent." According to the defence 
minister, the real problem is not the officers' demands but the 
means they have used in trying to resolve the existing issues. 
He described the sign-in campaign as "a conspicuous violation 
of the Constitution and breach of the Armed Forces' statute"; in 
his opinion, the culprits got their just deserts: A commander 
was punished by a dishonourable discharge from the army on 
disciplinary grounds, the other officers who had taken part in 
the sign-in were disciplined. 
  The defence minister said that according to a special poll 
conducted in the army by his order, the seeds of populism fell 
in good soil in the armed forces, while the financial 
difficulties and the opportunity for manipulations they offer 
could explode the situation.

  [Text] Sofia, March 16 (BTA) -- The MP's of the Civic 
Alliance for the Republic (GOR) will shortly break away from the 
parliamentary group of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), GOR 
leader Aleksandur Tomov told the press today. The Alliance was 
set up by 46 Bulgarian politicians, scientists, intellectuals 
and public figures last May as a non-profit public organization. 
In February it re-registered in court as a movement under the 
Political Parties Act. The Alliance claims that it has over 
25,000 members. 
  According to Tomov, the decision to split off from the 
parliamentary group of the Socialist Party (the former 
Communists) was taken last December but it is only now that the 
obstacles to a final break have been removed. 
  The main reason for the delay, Tomov said, was the passage 
of 
the 1994 Budget Act on February 28. In the coming days Tomov 
will officially inform the parliament chairman and the 
parliamentary group of the BSP-led coalition of GOR's step. 
  So far five GOR members have declared in writing they are 
leaving the parliamentary group of the BSP, STANDART NEWS said 
today. It takes ten MP's to set up a new group. If fewer MP's 
support GOR, they will go independent, according to Petya 
Shopova MP, quoted in the same daily. 
  Tomov today held a lengthy conversation with Ahmed Dogan, 
leader of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms, on 
whose mandate the present cabinet headed by Lyuben Berov was 
formed. Tomov and Dogan reached the conclusion that no cabinet 
crisis is in the offing and it would be unethical to call for a 
cabinet reshuffle or for consultations for a new cabinet.

  [Text] This afternoon NATO Secretary General Manfred 
Woerner gave an exclusive interview to Laszlo Mecs, DUNA 
Television's Brussels correspondent. The topic of their 
conversation centered on information that appeared in certain 
papers over the weekend about NATO reconnaissance planes staying 
in Hungary's airspace and their role in settling the Bosnian 
crisis. 
  [Begin Woerner recording, in English fading into Hungarian 
translation] First, allow me to state that the information I 
have heard up till now is misleading and does not represent the 
official NATO stance. Now I will outline our organization's 
official stance: 
  What NATO is doing is not a war maneuver; it is only 
supporting and asserting those prohibitive resolutions the 
United Nations has taken. These two resolutions are No. 781 and 
No. 816, which prescribe a military ban for entire nations and 
regional organizations. 
  What NATO is doing is to help the UN implement what it has 
decided. What Hungary has done, and is doing now as well, is to 
support the realization of the UN resolutions. I say once 
again: This is not a war maneuver, but an entire humanitarian 
action the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] are undertaking in 
Bosnia. This activity is not directed against any single side, 
but towards all those who violate the region's peace. Allow me 
to explain it this way. 
  At the same time, I do not doubt for one moment that 
cooperation between the Hungarian Government and NATO is 
anything but excellent. We both respect the other's activity. 
Hungary is an independent nation. It can decide to cooperate, 
and it could also decide not to do so. We are satisfied with 
what your country has done, and we would like to continue to 
cooperate with your country. We have no doubt that our 
relations will continue in the future as well, since this is in 
the mutual interest of our organization and of your country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of Free </F>
Democrats, by Attila Zsoldos; place and date not given: "The 
MDF Intimidates and Threatens the Voters, SZDSZ Chairman Ivan 
Peto Said"] 
  [Text] According to Ivan Peto, the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum [MDF] has still not understood that a party is one of the 
elements of political life and is not identical to the 
population. He also thinks that the biggest governing party 
builds its campaign on four major elements: the propaganda of 
success, separating the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and 
the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the intimidation of 
the electors, and the open threat that chaos would ensue in the 
country if the opposition parties came to government after the 
elections. In his interview with NEPSZABADSAG, Peto emphasized 
that the lasting consequences of a campaign based on the 
incitement of emotions will have a decisive effect on the period 
after the elections. However, a forced situation might arise in 
which the major parliamentary parties have to form closer ties 
than they have been used to. At the same time, Peto did not see 
much chance of this forced situation arising. We first asked 
Peto about his view on the latest campaign statements of the 
MDF's leading politicians. 
  [Peto] I can see four major elements in the MDF's campaign. 
One of these is the propaganda of success, which has been 
mentioned many times. I do not see any problem in the fact that 
a party or a government in power tries to convince the people 
that what they feel is not true and reality is different. 
However, it is worth analyzing what means they use in the 
interest of the propaganda of success. I see the fact that the 
government attributes everything that has happened in this 
country in the past four years that was not something negative 
to its own merit as more of a joke than a serious statement. 
The frequently heard declaration that Hungarian democracy was 
created by the MDF is more interesting. Although 15 March 1988, 
when the MDF thought that the commemoration should not be held 
in the streets, was not very long ago. It was not long ago, 
either, when precisely the MDF's leaders expressed their 
disapproval about the politicians of the SZDSZ and the Fidesz 
having a more outspoken attitude. 
  However, the propaganda of success also has a more 
problematic side. The MDF's politicians have a liking for 
saying that people who dare question that the success propaganda 
is well founded are in fact questioning the population's 
successes. In other words, they try to depict those who 
criticize them in some kind of anti-people light. It is typical 
of the MDF's self-image that it cannot process or understand the 
fact that a party is only an element of political life and is 
not identical to the people. 
  [Zsoldos] MDF Chairman Lajos Fur recently said that their 
period of being defensive had ended. What do you think this 
means? 
  [Peto] It was obvious that the "fortress under siege" 
mentality that has always been discerned in the MDF will 
increase with the approach of the elections. They have always 
refused criticism whether it came from the press or the 
opposition, so I do not see any new developments in the MDF's 
attitude. They only made an exception with the Fidesz because 
they have reacted to criticism coming from the Fidesz more 
tolerantly. 
  [Zsoldos] I do not believe you mention this unintentionally. 
  [Peto] Interestingly, the MDF has a chosen party among the 
opposition, namely the Fidesz. It has also been typical of the 
past four years that -- on a political level and not in 
individual statements -- the MDF's views on the Fidesz have 
always been very different from those on the SZDSZ. This 
distinction was particularly strange in those cases when the 
concepts of the two opposition parties were virtually identical. 
This is obviously a dual-purpose tactic on the MDF's part. It 
is trying to divide the Fidesz and the SZDSZ in such a way as to 
turn the Fidesz into a possible coalition partner for itself. 
  [Zsoldos] It seems that the Fidesz is an opposition party 
that is similar to the governmental Christian Democratic 
People's Party because all significant political forces see it 
as a potential partner. 
  [Peto] We can put it this way, but this "positive 
discrimination" is usually applied to the weak parties. If the 
Fidesz's election hopes come true, this role will be too narrow 
for it. The Fidesz would visibly like to get into a position 
where it is acceptable for everyone. The MDF is making use of 
this intention when, as the second marked element of its 
campaign, it is trying to get the Fidesz to break the unity of 
the liberal parties. 
  [Zsoldos] You are probably unmoved by this attempt. The 
Fidesz signed the cooperation agreement of the liberal parties 
and [Fidesz Chairman] Viktor Orban often emphasized that he 
considers the contents of this agreement as the norm when 
forming their policies. In other words, you have no reason to 
worry, or do you? 
  [Peto] I am not particularly concerned about this tactic of 
the MDF's. 
  [Zsoldos] Nevertheless, you mentioned it. 
  [Peto] The Fidesz's coalition possibilities will not be 
determined by the MDF's intentions. After the elections, the 
MDF will not be in a position to select coalition partners for 
itself. It might be able to accept offers, at the most. 
  [Zsoldos] Are you sure about this? 
  [Peto] I am. I believe that the MDF's parliamentary 
candidates have now also come to realize this. 
  [Zsoldos] Why? 
  [Peto] It is rumored that the citizens are not fighting to 
shower the MDF with candidate nomination slips. 
  [Zsoldos] In the interview we mentioned Fur also said that 
he does not know whether the SZDSZ is actually a left-wing 
party. In his view, it appears to be one because it is getting 
increasingly closer to the idea of a coalition with the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. 
  [Peto] I do not like these kinds of messages. These 
issues could be discussed with Fur in a public television 
debate, for example, if such things existed. As a matter of 
fact, the interview indicated that Fur does not have a realistic 
knowledge of the program the SZDSZ represents at the elections. 
  [Zsoldos] A week ago, you said that people in the provinces 
still feel that registers are kept on them. Why did you say 
this? 
  [Peto] On the basis of my experience. It happens with 
increasing frequency that people do not like to give candidate 
nomination slips to opposition parties because they feel that 
this can have consequences. They are worried that they will be 
identified on the basis of the personal identification number. 
In my view, the MDF is responsible for this atmosphere. I 
believe that intimidation is the third main element of their 
campaign. 
  [Zsoldos] But why do you blame the MDF for the worries? 
  [Peto] Because these people think that if the MDF government 
had the courage to fire Akos Mester [former chief editor of "168 
Ora" program] from the Radio, then it can also destroy the 
defenseless citizens if they give the nomination slips to 
opposition parties. If I also add that very many people have 
received government propaganda material sent to them with their 
name, address, and personal identification number on it, then it 
is even clearer why many people feel that they are on registers. 
From this point of view, the dismissal of the radio workers was 
a consciously timed and very effective action. 
  [Zsoldos] What do you think about the views of certain 
government politicians according to whom chaos will ensue in the 
country if the opposition comes to government? Is this also 
part of the intimidation? 
  [Peto] No, this belongs to the category of threats. I see 
this as the fourth determining element of the MDF's campaign, 
and as a proof of what I have said about the MDF's self-image. 
The foreign political consequences of the "we are the nation 
and if we are not in power then the nation's power does not 
prevail" attitude are also rather serious. It is ill-advised to 
suggest to the world that the democratic elections in Hungary 
could have some terrible outcome. Naturally, this threat is 
mainly meant for the Hungarian citizens. 
  [Zsoldos] To the extent that these statements were made in 
Hungary, rather than abroad. 
  [Peto] Unfortunately, not only in Hungary. I was in 
Transylvania on 15 March and I was told that the Hungarian 
Foreign Ministry state secretary had been alarming the 
Hungarians living there that if the SZDSZ came to power, it 
would seek the favor of the Romanians rather than the 
Hungarians. However, these kinds of statements have serious 
consequences even when they are made within the country. With 
the approach of the elections, even more foreign journalists are 
coming to Hungary. They and their embassies are watching the 
media. 
  [Zsoldos] Do you have any concrete indications that these 
statements have a negative influence on Hungary's image? 
  [Peto] There is tangible evidence that foreign political 
forces that are not close to the MDF consider these campaign 
measures, how shall I put it, peculiar. The foreign liberal and 
socialist parties are offended by the fact that a group speaks 
of parties that represent other political views as an extreme 
national peril. 
  [Zsoldos] Do you believe that these campaign elements can 
significantly influence the outcome of the elections? 
  [Peto] Naturally, they have an effect on the elections but 
not a significant one. They are important in the sense that the 
further consequences of politics based on the incitement of 
emotions will determine the period after the elections. A 
campaign that includes these unfair means does not improve 
relations between the parties. What has happened has happened 
and cannot be undone. 
  [Zsoldos] Are you suggesting that the MDF's ability to form 
a coalition will decrease to the minimum in the SZDSZ's view if 
it continues the criticized campaign? 
  [Peto] I am. It also means that the relationship that is 
formed during the campaign can lastingly determine ties between 
the two parties even if one is in opposition and the other in 
government. 
  [Zsoldos] Relations between the MDF and the SZDSZ have never 
been good. 
  [Peto] This is true. However, all cases that further 
deteriorate the current relationship or reduce the possibility 
of changing this relationship can have a lasting effect on 
events. 
  [Zsoldos] The MDF has verbally excluded the possibility of 
forming a coalition with the SZDSZ. On the other hand, the 
SZDSZ has not distanced itself from the MDF in this way. It 
emphasized that it is open to all democratic forces. Have your 
views changed? 
  [Peto] We continue to see the replacement of the current 
government coalition as one of the most important stakes at the 
elections. Our most important goal is that the liberal forces 
-- and the SZDSZ within this -- achieve the best possible 
results. There is no point in discussing now what kind of forced 
situation might arise after the elections. 
  [Zsoldos] Is it possible for a forced situation to arise in 
which the MDF and the SZDSZ have to join in a coalition? 
  [Peto] A forced situation might arise in which the 
possibility of this kind of coalition is raised. However, this 
is not a goal for the SZDSZ, in fact, it is absolutely 
undesirable. 
  [Zsoldos] Were you thinking of this forced situation when 
you said that it would be desirable for relations between the 
two parties not to deteriorate any further? 
  [Peto] There might be a situation when the two parties have 
to rise above their own points of view in the country's 
interest. It is possible that in this situation, the major 
parliamentary parties have to have a closer than usual 
relationship. However, this is only one possibility out of the 
many and I do not see much chance of this happening.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Voters Are More Uncertain"] </F>
  [Text] Voter support for various parties seems to be clear 
in March 1994, two months before the first round of 
parliamentary elections, with the supporters of various parties 
preserving their former character. The Hungarian Socialist 
Party [MSZP] continues to firmly maintain its leading position: 
Some 18 percent of the 937 citizens surveyed by the Szonda 
Ipsos Institute would vote for the MSZP if elections were held 
this Sunday. The support for the MSZP has remained practically 
unchanged over the last five months. The gradual loss of 
supporters of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] has 
continued, with 10 percent of all the people surveyed supporting 
them; with this figure, it continues to be in second place. The 
proportion of supporters of the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ] dropped by 3 percent; in the case of this party, we are 
witnessing a break in the slightly upward trend of recent 
months. Although none of these changes taken separately is 
considerable, the 5-percent drop in the support of the two 
liberal parties taken together is considerable. 
  The support for the other parliamentary parties has remained 
practically unchanged. Regarding the parties outside 
parliament, we can say that the extent of their support is far 
below the threshold needed to make it into Parliament. A new 
development in this area is that the Agricultural Federation has 
become a party with a measurable amount of support. 
  The voters give the MSZP the biggest chance of winning the 
elections. According to 24 percent of all the people surveyed, 
the MSZP will receive most votes (compared with only 21 percent 
in February). Some 11 percent of the people thought that the 
SZDSZ would win the elections, 6 percent thought the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF], and 6 percent thought the Fidesz. 
  The most interesting development this month is that the 
proportion of citizens without a firm party preference reached 
41 percent, a figure never achieved before. At the same time, 
readiness to participate in the elections remained at the high 
level measured last month (61 percent of the people surveyed are 
sure they will vote, and 16 percent will probably vote). It is 
a paradoxical effect of the official start of the election 
campaign that people who would like to vote have now become 
uncertain.

<F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Csucs, deputy chairman of Hungarian </F>
Radio, by unidentified correspondent; place and date not given 
-- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Csucs] I cannot be threatened or frightened. 
But there is one thing that I find very difficult to bear: My 
family also has to live in this atmosphere of threat. [passage 
omitted] 
  The extent of the media war's deterioration surpasses any 
imagination. And why? Purely and exclusively so that Hungarian 
Radio can speak to Hungarians and for Hungarians without any 
exclusion, by using the voice of decency. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] It is often said in various statements that 
there is a certain power behind you. Let me ask you, who is 
behind you? 
  [Csucs] I do not know who you mean, or which party. I have 
practically no support whatsoever. 
  [Correspondent] The [word indistinct] of the extreme right 
was mentioned. 
  [Csucs] I do not know any extreme right and especially 
dislike this kind of adjectival locution. [passage omitted] I 
start out from what the parliament laid down in the budget law. 
And there is no sense in making politics out of it, about 
whether the government or the coalition parties or some other 
parties dominate or not. As long as the management of the 
institution is in my hand, I try to fulfill the professional 
requirements of my job to the best of my ability. [passage 
omitted] 
  Even people opposing us did not dispute the fact that the 
level of overstaffing, which has reached the proportion of 
hydrocephaly, had to be tackled. On the other hand, we have to 
grab every opportunity to generate our own revenues. [passage 
omitted] 
  The reorganization is completed, the government approved the 
amendment of the operational regulations regarding these 
institutions, and parallel with the reduction of managerial 
jobs, ordinary jobs were also cut. However, the way the public 
was informed, precisely because in essence, almost exclusively 
in the hand of a particular circle [words indistinct] it was 
linked to a singularly political tone. 
  [Correspondent] So what was the motive in sacking the team 
of 
"168 Hours" and Akos Mester, their leader? 
  [Csucs] We can talk about "168 Hours." The supervisory 
committee evaluated its work not long ago but the listeners have 
also formed their opinion. Considerable deviation from 
objective informing can be unequivocally proven in the program. 
These excesses do not favor the government particularly, rather 
the opposite. And when I say this as a criticism, I also have 
to say that I did not expect any program, especially not "168 
Hours," to operate as the mouthpiece of the government, but 
neither do I expect, and what is more, I will not tolerate it 
operating as the mouthpiece of the opposition. This is a 
professional matter. [passage omitted] 
  I also consider it a professional matter that a Hungarian 
radio should speak to the Hungarians and for the Hungarians, 
that to profess to be Hungarian and to champion Hungarian 
interests should not be considered a shame. Hungarians should 
be given proper information in all matters, about the 
legislation in order that they should battle through the painful 
period of transition. Hungarians should not have to sneak close 
to the wall with their heads down but, in possession of 
appropriate information, they should walk confortably in their 
own country with their heads high. 
  [Correspondent] How long can this situation of being 
threatened be tolerated? How is your family bearing up to it? 
  [Csucs] Yes, I can still tolerate it but my family is 
suffering. The idea was most resolutely formulated that if in 
Hungary, not only the head of the family but also members of the 
family are persecuted for pledging Hungarian values, then one 
has to emmigrate. 
  From the country's point of view, if these affairs continue 
and things perhaps deteriorate, it will cause enormous damage. 
Just as ruining the country's reputation and discrediting it 
causes enormous damage, and certain radio employees are in the 
forefront of this. Earlier on I said that this was the betrayal 
of the nation but I can also say that it is the betrayal of the 
country. For this I will have to answer to the courts, since I 
was sued with the aim of financially ruining me. Well, this is 
where we are.

  [Text] Concerning the signing in Washington of the 
agreement between Bosnian Muslims and Croats on the creation of 
a joint federation, Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi 
gave this statement to the Voice of America correspondent in 
Tirana: 
  [Begin Serreqi recording] The Albanian Government hails the 
signing of the agreement, considering it a very important step 
and an act that opens a perspective for a stable and acceptable 
solution to the conflict. This was a result of a serious 
commitment by the United States, international pressure, and 
perhaps the obligation of Russian diplomacy in the Balkans. 
  Judging from the rate and outcome of these efforts and the 
results in the field, we reckon that, at least, this stops that 
part of the conflict, avoids that part of the war, the most 
absurd part of the war -- the Croat-Bosnian war. 
  Of course, it points out the aggressor more, against whom 
there should be no illusions. However, the line of political 
isolation and the strict application of sanctions should 
continue, and they must be conditioned by other elements of the 
crisis. 
  Of course, the results of this agreement bring to the fore 
those other elements which, because of the tragedy of the war in 
Bosnia, have been somewhat marginalized. Here I want to point 
out the problem of Kosova and reiterate that by signing the 
agreement, this is the first step, a step that should be 
followed by other measures to solve the crisis definitively, a 
crisis that cannot be solved without finding an acceptable and 
stable solution to the Kosova issue and the pan-Albanian problem 
in the Balkans. [end recording]

  [Text] Bashkim Kopliku, deputy chairman of the Council of 
Ministers, and his Macedonian counterpart Jovan Andonov held 
business talks in Tirana today. The talks focused on the 
cooperation and port facilities that Albania may offer to 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
on the transport of goods from the Adriatic shores to Macedonia. 
  We are predisposed to help Macedonia, Kopliku said at this 
meeting. Moreover, we are related to Macedonia by the fact that 
about 40 percent of its inhabitants are of Albanian nationality. 
  The talks mainly focused on two main directions of the 
demands by the Macedonian side: to ensure the use of Durres 
port for transport as well as the use of one of the fuel stores 
in Vlore. 
  Assessing the help that Albania would give to Macedonia, 
Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister Andonov asked that 30 percent 
of goods destined for Macedonia should pass through Albania, 
with advantageous conditions regarding customs expenses. 
Kopliku declared the readiness of the Albanian Government to 
reach an understanding. 
  The Macedonian side confirmed its readiness to include 
Albania in the project to construct a gas pipeline from Russia 
to Skopje, and from there to Albania.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Threats to the Trial"] </F>
  [Text] Tirana -- Another scandal has broken out in 
connection with the trial over the aid scandal in which 
Socialist leader Fatos Nano is one of the accused. Whereas it 
was expected that the Friday [18 March] session would deal with 
documentary testimony and the examination of all the written 
evidence in the investigators' file, two different testimonies 
shocked the courtroom. These concerned serious threats against 
direct or indirect participants in this trial, connected with 
the further course of the judgement of Fatos Nano. In a 
strongly worded protest, Prosecutor Arben Qeleshi publicly 
confirmed the existence of a violent threat against the husband 
of expert witness Virgjeresha Shkreli, threatening him with 
physical liquidation if his wife were to testify against Nano at 
the trial. Immediately after this, Nano's lawyer Perparim 
Sanxhaku made public another fact. According to him, a 
now-identified individual had threatened him because he is the 
Socialist leader's defense lawyer. 
  "On the afternoon of 17 March, certain people whom the 
police 
and justice authorities have still not identified used physical 
and psychological pressure in the most unscrupulous and inhuman 
fashion against the husband of the expert witness Virgjeresha 
Shkreli," Prosecutor Qeleshi declared in his protest, "to the 
point of pointing a loaded pistol into his mouth and saying 
that, if his wife appeared in court, we will physically 
eliminate you and hang you." Before the file on the aid scandal 
was sent to the court, the expert witness Shkreli and her two 
colleagues had worked on calculating the amount of Italian aid 
lost, which the prosecutor has claimed were appropriated and 
misused. However, according to court rules, the work of the 
experts attached to the investigation must also be examined in 
court in the final stages of the judicial procedure. 
  Only a few moments after Prosecutor Qeleshi's protest, the 
lawyer Sanxhaku reported another serious threat, this time 
against himself. "At 1730 on 15 March, an identified person 
driving a car with the license plate TR 2651 A threatened me 
personally," Sanxhaku declared, "saying that they would hang me 
from a rope." Thus, two very special pieces of evidence have 
come to light, joining Prosecutor Qeleshi's statement a few days 
before the start of the trial that he too had been personally 
threatened.

<F P=106> [Armand Mero report: "Less Prison for the Blockmen -- They </F>
Will Pay the State Compensation"] 
  [Text] Tirana -- The blockmen will pay compensation to 
Albania. The Higher Appeal Court [Gjykata e Kasacionit], the 
Albanian judiciary final resort, has had its final say: The 10 
former functionaries of the Albanian Workers Party must pay a 
total of more than 2 million leks. But this is not all. The 
presiding judge, although confirming the charge made by the 
Tirana District Court of "creating social inequality by 
colluding to create privileges," has softened the sentence of 
the Appeal Court by reducing the number of years that those 
convicted will spend languishing in prison cells. 
  Thus the trial of the blockmen has concluded in Tirana, and 
with it one of the chapters in the history of communism in 
Albania. Judge Zef Nika issued his final verdict in one of the 
Higher Appeal Court's halls at 1400 on Thursday [17 March], by 
announcing: "A conclusion to the civil case obliging all those 
convicted to pay the following sums in compensation to the 
Government Services Directorate: Qirjako Mihali, 227,944 leks; 
Pali Miska, 213,086 leks; Besnik Bekteshi, 257,733 leks; 
Vangjel Cerrava, 128,834 leks; Prokop Murra, 269,439 leks; 
Llambi Gegprifti, 195,023 leks; Muho Asllani, 168,357 leks; 
Hajredin Celiku, 142,787 leks; Foto Cami, 202,154 leks; and 
Lenka Cuko, 283,220 leks." The Higher Appeal Court has also 
reduced by a total of 13 years the sentences given by the Appeal 
Court to the blockmen. Qirjako Mihali, Foto Cami, and Lenka 
Cuko profit most from this, with reductions of two years each. 
The others' sentences are reduced by one year each. 
  The final stage of the blockmen's trial began at 1230 in the 
Higher Appeal Court. As the law demands, this time the accused 
were not present in court, and only their lawyers faced the 
bench of three. The blockmen's defense was heard for the last 
time for almost 40 minutes, as their lawyers asked for a 
reduction in their sentences, considering them to be 
"excessively severe". Prokop Murra's lawyer asked for a review 
of the verdicts of the Tirana District Court and of the Appeals 
Court that had among other things stripped him of the 
decorations and medals he had received. "At least let the 
decorations awarded for the period of the National Liberation 
War be recognized." 
  Only a few minutes sufficed to read the accusations and to 
come to the end of this vitally important trial. Now the 
accusations have also been finally defined. The Higher Appeal 
Court has left intact the charge leveled by Tirana District 
Court of "creating social inequality by colluding to create 
privileges," and has overthrown the Appeal Court's "collusion 
for the abuse of office." Judge Nika also left in force the 
decision to remove titles and decorations, refusing to make an 
exception, as Prokop Murra's defense counsel had requested, for 
those awarded for the period of the war.

<F P=106> [T. Cela article: "Can Radio and Television That Speak </F>
Albanian Be Considered Albanian?"] 
  [Text] The situation that the independent and opposition 
Albanian press is experiencing is among the most difficult, or, 
not to mince words, most alarming that it has ever experienced. 
Journalists were not as much under threat as they are today even 
in the days when the system was changing, in the first days of 
pluralism, nor in the days of severe political tensions with 
strikes and upheavals. When we say that we have won freedom 
today, have gained democracy, and no longer live under a 
dictatorship, we nevertheless have many more journalists before 
the courts, in the prosecutors' offices, and in prison. We have 
today more journalists than ever before hit on the head with 
iron bars, and a journalist is frightened to walk on the street 
lest he be charged and imprisoned for stepping over the white 
lines. A journalist today is frightened of drinking coffee with 
an acquaintance, because he can be charged and imprisoned as an 
accomplice, and you cannot say that someone in power is 
incompetent because you will be charged and imprisoned for 
slander. Thus, journalists are under greater threat today than 
ever. These threats come from two directions, from the state 
and the street -- from the state with handcuffs for the wrists, 
and from the street with an iron bar for the head. 
  To make known and protest these threats, the Professional 
Journalists Association held a news conference last Saturday [12 
March] for Albanian and foreign journalists and representatives 
of the diplomatic corps accredited to Tirana, a news conference 
widely reported by some Albanian newspapers. However, what made 
a greater impression was the way in which the state media 
handled it. Albanian Television, which had its journalists 
present in the hall, did not report a single word about this 
news conference that was so important for the threatened 
journalists, not a word about extreme and unjust prison 
sentences, and not a word about physical menaces. Meanwhile, 
the BBC's Albanian language service from London devoted a 
prominent eight-minute feature to the news conference, with 
interviews with participants. The ET3 television station also 
came to Tirana from Greece with a camera and a microphone, 
interviewing the association's chairman, Prec Zogaj, and 
presidium member Aleksander Frangaj, who had spent one month in 
prison. 
  Albanian Radio-Television's [RTSh] ridiculousness is thus 
obvious: It does not report problems that worry the independent 
and opposition press or death threats against these journalists. 
Europe, London, and Athens turn out to be closer than Tirana (by 
Tirana, I mean RTSh). Who is it who is making Albanian 
journalists beholden to foreign associations, newspapers, and 
radio and television stations and making them say, "Shame on 
Tirana?" Who are these people who are sullying the name of 
RTSh, obliging Albanians to turn away from the only Albanian 
channel and watch and listen to foreign stations to find out 
what is happening in Albania? Seen from this point of view, 
the question inevitably arises of whether the only radio and 
television station that speaks Albanian can be considered 
Albanian. 
  It is a real scandal that today, when it is claimed that 
something has been won in the direction of freedom, Albanians 
should huddle around foreign radio stations in order to find out 
what is happening in Albania. It reminds one precisely of the 
early days of changes in Albania, when we were working to bring 
down the dictatorship, and when Albanians gathered at home at 
1830 in order to listen to Voice of America as the only station 
that then reported developments and activities of those who were 
in opposition to the state and were working against the 
dictatorship. At that time, RTSh defended that state and the 
dictatorship. Today too, RTSh defends the state. The 
opposition, independent thinking, and events or activities that 
comment on or conflict with the political regime of today can 
only be learned about on foreign stations. This shows that this 
regime is scared of the truth.

  [Text] Illegal and unrecognized organizations are pouring 
out threats and sharpening their shears regarding Bulgaria, 
while the Romanian leaders simply stay mum when the issue of 
these actions by their homegrown nationalists is raised. 
  To put it mildly, the top statesmen in Bucharest are 
protecting them and say nothing when they reveal their appetites 
for "the ancient Romanian lands." 
  The "Great Romania" Organization has itself admitted in a 
letter that it is acting under the authorities' wing. Again, 
Prime Minister Vacaroiu is reported to have told the parliament 
speaker not to provide any information about the "Romanian 
Guard." 
  The nationalism game in the Balkans has reaped enough 
victims 
this century. It is time for the people in Bucharest to 
remember that we are living in a powder keg, so they should 
refrain from making territorial claims. 
  Alternatively, they should proclaim their claims openly, 
instead of hiding behind real or fictitious organizations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman by an </F>
unidentified correspondent in Washington on 18 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] After signing the 
agreement in Washington you first met with U.S. President 
Clinton. What do you consider to be the highlights of that 
meeting? 
  [Tudjman] It goes without saying that this meeting was of 
exceptional importance to me and the Croatian delegation. We 
discussed ways of translating into practice what we had agreed 
on by signing the accord. In this regard we primarily stated 
that Croatia needed U.S. and European support in order to 
resolve the issue of Croatia's territories temporarily under UN 
protection; that is, the incorporation of those territories into 
Croatia's constitutional and legal system. Naturally, we also 
discussed many other issues from the area of international 
relations, especially issues of relevance to bilateral relations 
between Croatia and the United States. 
  [Correspondent] Did you have any interesting encounters with 
the representatives of the European Union? How do they view 
America's sudden decision to join in the process of resolving 
the crisis in the region of former Yugoslavia? 
  [Tudjman] Yes, I met with the troika -- you know what that 
means, the present chairman of the European Union, Greek 
[Foreign] Minister Papoulias, former Chairman Claes and future 
Chairman Kinkel, German vice chancellor and foreign minister -- 
and then with Van den Broek and with around a dozen European 
ministers and ambassadors. We discussed the agreement and 
topical issues, primarily -- again -- the integration of the 
territories occupied by Serbia and under the protection of the 
peacekeeping forces into Croatia. 
  [Correspondent] Let us go back to the agreements signed and 
possibilities for their implementation in the field. In your 
opinion, what is the minimum territory the Muslim-Bosniak 
federation [as heard] should get? 
  [Tudjman] Well, there has been no discussion on that subject 
here in Washington. However, it has been established in the 
course of the talks so far within the framework of the European 
conference on former Yugoslavia and on resolving the Bosnian 
crisis that the present Croat-Muslim federation in Bosnia should 
get 51 percent. Namely, it was envisaged at the time that the 
Muslims should get 33.5 percent and the Croats 17.5. Therefore, 
this is a minimum below which we cannot go, while talks are to 
continue on the basis of the Muslim demand for an increase in 
these territories, that is, as is often heard on the margins of 
diplomatic conversations -- the Serbs would have to pay a price 
for joining the confederation. So, it is out of the question 
that the Serbs could retain more than 50 percent, as some are 
saying. 
  [Correspondent] Yesterday Mr. Redman was our guest in this 
same program. He mentioned not only the amount of territory 
that the Serbs should hand back but also the quality of 
territory, too. Would you like to specify and tell us what the 
most desirable territories are in the event of their being 
handed back to the Muslim-Croatian federation? 
  [Tudjman] I believe that at the moment it would not be 
advisable for me to dwell on these issues, which will be 
negotiated. It is important to tell our public that the most 
important factors of world and European politics are in 
agreement that one should seek solutions at the green table, 
that a political agreement should be reached. Understandably, 
this agreement should be such as to take account of geostrategic 
interests too. 
  [Correspondent] Talking about geostrategic interests, I 
believe that Croatia, people in Croatia, may find it 
particularly interesting as to whether this possible demand for 
the return of territories will sever the corridor to the 
so-called Krajina? 
  [Tudjman] This issue, too, well, it remains to be seen in 
the 
course of talks. For us it is essential that we have the full 
support of the United States and the European Union, that is, 
all international factors, for the return of Croatian 
territories into Croatia's constitutional and legal system. 
  [Correspondent] Let us stay a bit longer on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. In your opinion, should, and under what 
conditions, the Serbs from Bosnia-Herzegovina be allowed to join 
the Croat-Muslim federation? 
  [Tudjman] It seems to me that this question is unnecessary 
because the Serbs have so far shown no interest in living in a 
union. Therefore, what will probably be at issue is whether the 
Serbs can be forced to temporarily remain in some kind of loose 
union with the Croat-Bosnian federation, for a temporary 
solution, a definitive solution. [sentence as heard] The 
possibility of forming a confederation within the framework of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is not discussed at all now. What is 
important, what the world has tried to achieve, is to establish 
peace between Croats and Muslims because it is in strategic 
interests to end the war and to reach a demarcation that would, 
in the future, guarantee a more stable order in this region. 
  [Correspondent] In discussions of a global solution to the 
crisis in the region, a global settlement is very often 
mentioned. People here in Croatia have recently started fearing 
a possible revival of some kind of loose union in the region. 
Do you think that if the Bosnian Serbs are allowed to remain in 
the federation and have some kind of link with Serbia, that the 
international community will exert pressure on Croatia to join a 
confederation with Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Tudjman] It can be supposed that some circles in the 
international community would exert such pressure, and some are 
still nurturing such ideas. This is a well-known fact. 
However, the important and responsible international factors 
know that there can be no revival of Yugoslavia, of the Yugoslav 
union, and that regardless of what Serbia wants, Croatia on the 
other hand is firm in its standpoint that a new international 
order in this region is possible only on the basis of the mutual 
recognition of sovereign states created on the territory of the 
former Yugoslavia. 
  [Correspondent] A meeting of representatives of Croatia and 
the so-called Krajina is scheduled, as we know, to take place in 
the Russian Embassy on Tuesday. Some information has been 
leaked, so I would like to check it with you. Is it true that 
our delegation will be headed by Hrvoje Sarinic and the Serb 
delegation by Mile Novakovic? 
  [Tudjman] Hrvoje Sarinic will head our delegation, that is 
true. I also heard before my departure that their delegation 
will be headed by....[changes thought] But there will also be 
someone else as their political representative. Our public is 
probably also interested in the fact that this meeting was 
convened by President Yeltsin's special envoy Churkin. This 
meeting will be attended by a U.S. representative, too. 
  [Correspondent] Will this meeting, as Churkin said, focus 
solely on a cease-fire, or will some political relations be 
discussed nevertheless at this early stage? 
  [Tudjman] The agenda for this meeting will, of course, 
include a cease-fire, meaning the securing of -- shall I say -- 
a general cease-fire, something that will be an introduction to 
the further process of normalizing relations. In this context, 
one certainly cannot rule out talks on these issues. 
  [Correspondent] A question that inevitably arises: Will 
Croatia have to alter some of its present laws -- the law on 
minorities, the law on the internal set-up, for instance -- in 
the process of reintegrating the so-called Krajina? 
  [Tudjman] Well, Croatia had passed a constitutional law in 
conformity with the demands of the European Community, as it was 
known at the time -- the present European Union -- and in 
accordance with suggestions made by the arbitration commission 
headed by prominent French expert Badintere. There will be no 
reason for fundamentally altering Croatia's legislature. 
Understandably, we for our part will be flexible enough to 
reach an agreement on the peaceful integration of those regions 
into Croatia's constitutional and legal system while remaining 
determined not to allow Croatia's sovereignty to be eroded. 
  [Correspondent] Could you please clarify this concept, this 
syntagma frequently heard of late -- expanded autonomy. 
  [Tudjman] There can be no talk of any other expanded 
autonomy 
but the one already discussed. I am referring to two districts 
-- Glina and Knin, where the Serbs are in the majority. It is 
there that they will have the right to local self-rule in 
accordance with our Constitution and constitutional laws. Also, 
of course, the entire Serb community in Croatia will have all 
human rights guaranteed as well as ethnic community rights in 
harmony with international conventions. 
  [Correspondent] We have heard certain rumors, and some 
observers -- we will not name them now -- claim that the 
so-called Krajina [Serb-held areas in eastern and southern 
Croatia] should be given the status that Kosovo and Vojvodina 
had under the 1974 Constitution of the former SFRY [Socialist 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. What do you think about that? 
  [Tudjman] I think that such claims are nebulous. Kosovo is a 
province inhabited not only by a huge national minority, but 
also by almost 2 million Albanians who have a 90 percent 
majority and live in a compact area. In the same way, Vojvodina 
is a separate and historical province, which was not part of 
Serbia and Yugoslavia until 1918, and it is also ethnically, 
nationally mixed. There can be no comparison in that respect 
with the so-called Krajina in Croatia, which is not 
territorially linked and where the Serbs are in a proportional 
minority, except in the two districts that I have mentioned -- 
Glina and Knin -- which are not territorially linked. 
  [Correspondent] By all appearances, the sanctions against 
Belgrade are the only effective means against greater Serbian 
policies. In your opinion, is it now possible to lift the 
sanctions in exchange for [Serbia] giving up the so-called 
Krajinas? 
  [Tudjman] Now you have used the term exchange, such an 
exchange is possible only when a positive, acceptable solution 
is reached simultaneously -- with Serbia's consent -- in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and when Croatia's territories currently 
under the peace forces' protection are reintegrated into Croatia. 
  [Correspondent] In your view, now that the agreement has 
been signed, has Croatia's position become stronger in the eyes 
of the Security Council, the United Nations? 
  [Tudjman] Absolutely. In making its demands, Croatia's 
position is now very favorable. Croatia's position in the 
international community has become such that it has friendly 
relations, the closest relations with the United States; it has 
the understanding of the European Union in general, especially 
the leading European countries and, what is not important [as 
heard], the complete understanding -- especially now after the 
signing of these agreements on a federation and a confederation 
-- of a large number of Islamic countries and nonaligned 
countries which, as you know, are numerous and which are playing 
an important role in the work of the Security Council and the 
United Nations. To this effect Croatia's demands will be met by 
far greater understanding because Croatia has again shown that 
it is pursuing a consistent policy of resolving matters 
peacefully, that its objectives are in conformity with the 
international community. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. President. 
  [Tudjman] Thank you and a good night to you.

  [Text] We have just received a special telephone statement 
by Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Radio and Television. 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] We have just ended, five 
minutes ago, a meeting with the European troika: European Union 
Chairman Papoulias of Greece; Kinkel; and Claes, who was the 
previous EU chairman. Some other European statesmen were also 
present, Van den Broek among them. Some 20 of them attended the 
meeting. We discussed -- I am talking about things that have 
not been made public today because they happened just now -- we 
discussed the promotion of peace in Sarajevo, the reconstruction 
of Sarajevo, the appointment of EU administrators for Mostar and 
visions regarding the reconstruction of these cities. In all, 
what could I add to what I said today and what you have already 
heard? 
  I wish to say that it is very important that the first 
results of these talks are tangible; they are evident. They 
have become evident in many parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina where 
people are no longer being killed and where we had been fighting 
until recently. Convoys are now passing freely there, lives are 
no longer being lost in those regions. Life is returning in a 
way -- a ray of life -- to Mostar, the old part of Vitez. They 
are perfectly aware of this in Sarajevo. What is important is 
that the results of this are being felt. That proves this is a 
real change. This is not what we used to call a change on 
paper. I believe we have good reason to look to the future with 
optimism. 
  A significant change has occurred in the balance of forces 
in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. I do not believe we should take advantage 
of that to prolong the war, but I think that this increased 
strength should be used to achieve a just peace. This is our 
right, it is our right to do this, and this we shall do. 
  Washington was, so to speak, the center of the world today 
-- 
not to say that it is not otherwise -- because a large number of 
statesmen assembled here today to take part in this event. This 
added weight to this event, which goes to show that we are not 
the only ones who are directly involved, who are vitally 
interested, but many other responsible people in the world are 
also involved who feel that something is changing. Of course, 
we should all try to contribute to this process as best we can. 
We, our government, will do all we can in this respect. I 
cannot help recalling that, unfortunately, people in Maglaj, 
Bihac, Brcko, and in some other places have sensed relief. 
Fighting is still going on there, lives are being lost, but it 
seems that better days are at hand. [end recording]

Bosniak-Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina" signed in Washington on 
18 March -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Today we confirm the proposed constitution of the 
Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as a preliminary 
agreement concerning future economic and military cooperation 
between the Federation [of Bosnia-Herzegovina] and the Republic 
of Croatia. 
  These agreements mark our common commitment to restoring 
peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and throughout our region. We have 
agreed to step up our efforts in the search for an overall 
political settlement that ensures the protection of human rights 
and the preservation of the sovereignty and territorial 
integrity of all states in the region. 
  The Bosniak and Croatian delegations affirm their commitment 
to propose this constitution to a Constitutional Assembly as the 
basis for a federation ensuring full national equality, 
democratic relations, and the highest standards of human rights 
and freedoms. All delegations lend their support to the 
principles of the confederation, which can lay the foundation 
for a more prosperous and secure future for the peoples of the 
region. 
  To broaden our cooperation, we have decided that we will 
immediately do the following: 
  1. Form a joint group to be the sole representative of the 
Bosniaks and Croats in all negotiations with the Serbs 
concerning an overall settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  2. Ask the CSCE to appoint an ombudsman to begin work in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with the mandate described in the proposed 
constitution. 
  3. Invite the European Union to organize its administration 
of the district of Mostar as soon as possible. 
  4. Continue the full and immediate implementation of the 
measures agreed by the military transition team in Split on 12 
March, and encourage steps for the further disengagement of 
forces.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1425 GMT on 18 March carries in its 
regular 22-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in 
the republic. 
  The Gradacac Information Center says that "after a very 
quiet 
morning, practically without a single bullet being fired, the 
[Serbian] enemy suddenly opened fire at a vehicle carrying the 
Nordic battalion of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]. At 1020 
the enemy fired several 120-mm mortars from Skugric at the 
peacekeeping forces on regular patrol of the region of Vida. The 
vehicle went up in flames but the soldiers managed to escape in 
time, so that -- at least according to the latest information -- 
there are no wounded." The report says that "at the moment NATO 
planes are constantly flying over Gradacac." 
  Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac that "the Serb aggressor 
has continued his attacks on the defense lines on the 
Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau, Hasin Vrh, and Barakovac, and the 
members of the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa 
autonomy have also stepped up their attacks on the free part of 
the Bihac region. After continuous artillery and tank attacks 
overnight, this morning Karadzic's terrorists again tried 
another infantry breakthrough on Hasin Vrh. In collusion with 
the chetniks, the so-called autonomy army continued to attack in 
the area of Krivaja in the Cazin commune. Several of our 
fighters were wounded in these attacks, and three were 
unfortunately killed. More of our fighters were killed in the 
bestial chetnik pounding of the defense positions." He said 
that "according to incomplete information, nine people were 
killed and several dozen wounded overnight and today." 
  Reporting from Bugojno, Atif Agic says that "this is the 
third day that the general alarm is constantly in force to warn 
civilians of the chetnik shells. Five people have been wounded 
so far as the town has been subjected to sudden shellings."

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, March 19 (AFP) -- Three people were 
wounded in a mortar attack on Sarajevo Saturday, in the first 
major breach of the heavy-weapon exclusion zone, the press 
service of the Moslem-dominated Bosnian government said. 
[passage omitted] 
  While there have been reports of previous violations of the 
cease-fire and the heavy weapons exclusion zone, this would 
appear to be the first time civilians had been wounded in a 
shell attack on Sarajevo since early February. The United 
Nations Protection Force could not confirm Saturday that a shell 
had been fired but said military observers had been sent to the 
site to investigate. Major Jose Labandeira, a UN spokesman, said 
that whatever the cause, it was an "isolated incident". It was 
very difficult to control all the 40 to 60 millimeter mortars 
which can be carried around by an individual, he said.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 19 (TANJUG) -- A U.N. officer has 
resolutely denied allegations by Moslem authorities in Sarajevo 
that the explosion that left three persons wounded in the 
Alipasino Polje suburb on Saturday was caused by a Serb mortar 
shell. 
  Lieutenant-Colonel [name indistinct] Pernod of the French 
battalion within the U.N. Protection Force in war-torn 
Bosnia-Herzegovina said that the explosion was the result of a 
rifle-launched grenade, the AFP reports. 
  The maximum range of such a grenade is 600 metres and the 
nearest Serb positions are 1,500 metres away from the place 
where the explosion occurred, Pernod specified.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 18 (AFP) -- Britain will provide 12 
million pounds (18 million dollars) to the costs of rebuilding 
Sarajevo, British Prime Minister John Major said Friday as he 
visited the war-scarred Bosnian capital. A total of five million 
pounds will be provided now and seven million pounds later, 
Major said. 
  The Bosnian Government has estimated the cost of 
reconstructing Sarajevo at 3.1 billion dollars. 
  Major, in Sarajevo Friday for talks with Bosnian 
Vice-President Ejup Ganic and the British commander of UN troops 
in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, briefly toured a 
water pumping station in the city and visited a position held by 
a Scottish contingent of UN troops. On his arrival in Sarajevo 
from the central Bosnian town of Vitez, the headquarters of the 
British contingent in the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), Major 
vaunted the "chance for peace" in the region and said more UN 
troops would be needed soon to monitor the emerging ceasefires. 
He later left the city by helicopter to return to the southern 
Croatian port of Split, before returning to London.

<F P=106> [Interview with Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska </F>
republic, by unidentified correspondent; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. President, the Croat and Muslim 
sides in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina have reached an agreement 
on federation. The Serbian side was generously offered the 
opportunity to join the agreement and express its stand on this 
federation agreement between Croats and Muslims. What is 
understood so far is that the Serbian side is not going to join 
the agreements bilaterally. 
  [Karadzic] First of all, the agreement was made without us 
and without any participation by us, so I do not see how 
somebody can expect us to join and accept something that others 
have adjusted to their own needs. As regards their own right to 
live as they want to, we have no comment. This is derived from 
their sovereign right to determine the way in which they are 
going to live, as well as their mutual relations. We are 
retaining this same right for ourselves. However, within the 
European Conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina we accepted certain 
obligations toward the European Community and have fulfilled 
these obligations. The European Community, as a representative 
of the international community, has accepted some obligations 
toward us and should fulfill these obligations. We are not 
going to enter any new conference until these obligations are 
fulfilled, and they mostly regard the lifting or suspension of 
sanctions against the Serbian people. Any further talks imply a 
relation on an equal footing between the negotiating sides and 
in this respect the Serbian side cannot negotiate if it is not 
freed from sanctions, that is to say, if it is not treated in an 
equal fashion. 
  In any case, we are not going to refuse to negotiate all 
possible alternatives. What we see as priorities are, first, 
that the war should stop. Second, a just delimitation 
[delimitacija] should be carried out and borders established. 
Third, only then should we decide what relations should be 
established between these new entities. Here I do not think 
only about the Serbian Republic, but also about the Republic of 
Serbian Krajina and Croatia and the Croatian-Muslim Federation 
and Yugoslavia. In any case, relations between the new entities 
will present much less problem than the delimitation, and 
delimitation is much less of a problem than putting a stop to 
war. Therefore, one should first stop the war. The Serbs are 
ready to stop the war without setting any conditions, so we 
should not fight anywhere. However, as regards all other 
things, that would nevertheless rather like starting a new 
conference and to enter a new conference, we demand that the 
international community fulfill its obligations towards us.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 18 Mar (TANJUG) -- "The Croats and the 
Muslims today exercised their sovereign right to decide on how 
they wish to live and, as long as this is not aimed against the 
Serbs, we are ready to accept this agreement as their choice," 
president of the Srpska republic Radovan Karadzic said while 
commenting on the signing of the Croat-Muslim agreement. "We are 
closely examining every individual implication of that 
agreement, hoping that it will lead to peace," he added. 
  Commenting on U.S. President Clinton's statement on the need 
to include the Serb side, with the aim of achieving total peace, 
the Srpska republic president said that the Serbs are ready to 
join every peace process. "We are already involved in the peace 
process under the patronage of the European Union, and we are 
ready to sign a peace agreement at any time, but we expect 
guarantees that all three sides would be treated equally, which 
includes the issue of the lifting of the sanctions," Karadzic 
said. 
  Asked by correspondents how he interpreted Izetbegovic's 
statement in Washington today, when Izetbegovic emphasized the 
problem of preserving the old borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Karadzic said that today's events have created a completely new 
international legal and political situation. 
  "In this respect you cannot have your cake and eat it too. 
This is a new state created on the basis of their sovereign 
rights. We can either be sorry or happy for being excluded from 
this state of theirs, but the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina as 
desired by Mr. Izetbegovic simply no longer exist. In fact, 
they have never really existed because we never accepted the 
idea of a Bosnia outside Yugoslavia," President Karadzic said.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic </F>
by 'Ali Maghniyah in Sarajevo; date not given] 
  [Text] The Muslim Bosnians hope that the equation in Bosnia 
will change after the signing of the cease-fire agreement with 
the Bosnian Croats last month and starting negotiations on the 
establishment of a federal union with the Bosnian Croats 
followed by another federal union between the new federation and 
Croatia. 
  The Muslims are also hoping that NATO's threats last month 
will be effective. NATO recently threatened to bomb the Serbian 
heavy artillery positions if it is not withdrawn to a distance 
of 20 kilometers from the besieged Bosnian capital or placed 
under the supervision of the UN forces. 
  Despite what has been said about the agreement between the 
Muslims and the Croats being fragile, and that observers believe 
that this agreement does not mean the complete end of the 
fighting between the two sides, there is great optimism 
regarding an extended truce. This truce, if it is destined to 
continue, is enough to relieve the pressure on the Muslims in 
central Bosnia and give them a chance to concentrate on the 
territories occupied by the Serbs. It is also natural for the 
Bosnian Army to continue preparing to build a strong military 
base to confront any future dangers. That army's preparations 
are expected to rely on supplies coming through the center of 
Bosnia and Croatia -- as was the case before the war erupted 
between the Croatians and the Muslims -- in light of the 
cease-fire and the political understanding between the two sides. 
  Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic said he hoped that NATO 
will maintain its credibility regarding the warning it issued to 
the Bosnian Serbs. He called for lifting the arms embargo on 
Bosnia so that it can defend itself. He believes that Britain 
is putting pressure on the United States to weaken the 
enthusiasm of U.S. President Bill Clinton for the Muslim 
Bosnians. Ganic strongly attacked the European Union's mediator 
in Bosnia, David Owen. He said: "We do not want to deal with 
this arrogant Briton, who becomes more and more arrogant every 
time he appears on the international television networks." 
  In an interview with AL-SAFIR conducted at the presidential 
palace in Sarajevo, Ganic said: "We hope that NATO will keep 
its credibility. If NATO strikes the Serbs, we will be very 
grateful. If it does not, we will remain steadfast and fight 
until our territory is liberated. All we ask of the West is to 
let us defend ourselves and lift the embargo. Sarajevo is not 
the whole of Bosnia. Over 70 percent of our territory needs to 
be liberated. Getting back this territory is our duty to our 
people." 
  He added: "Everything the crazy Serbs are doing is being 
permitted and accepted because they have not encountered anyone 
to deter them. The international organization [UN] is playing 
the role of the doctor who is trying to cure the wound 
superficially because he does not want to remove the microbe 
that causes it. We in Bosnia are telling them to let us do that 
for ourselves. We do not want your help, but do not get in our 
way and hamper us." 
  [Maghniyah] Do you believe that the West really wants to 
defend the Muslims in Bosnia? 
  [Ganic] I believe that the West is concerned about 
maintaining its credibility and appearing in history as an 
honorable party. World public opinion is on our side and 
supports our cause. However, nowadays we are living in a fascist 
age. Ethnic cleansing is now condoned in the eyes of the 
Europeans. If the Serbs insist on altering Bosnia's borders, we 
will have a real state of chaos in the whole of Europe. 
  Russia today supports the Serbs. There is a prevalent 
opinion in Europe hoping that the Serbs continue to kill the 
Muslim Bosnians so that Europe will have ample justification to 
deal with them once and for all with the approval of the 
Russians. However, all this will happen at the expense of our 
people. 
  I personally believe that Britain is putting pressure on the 
United States to undermine the Clinton Administration's 
enthusiasm for backing the Muslims. France was not on our side 
but it was not able to oppose striking the Serbs. But Germany 
had an honorable and very clear stand in our favor. This is why 
I am somewhat optimistic regarding the fate of the Muslims in 
Bosnia. 
  [Maghniyah] It is said that you head the extremist Muslim 
current. 
  [Ganic] I am a nationalist, not an extremist. I am an 
educated man who studied in the United States. But today, I 
lead my people because they are being killed. I asked the 
Muslims to train to fight because the Briton Lord Owen would not 
negotiate with us if we had no weapons. When the battles 
between the Muslims and Croats started, I asked Lord Owen why he 
was negotiating with the latter. He said because they had 
weapons. We are defending ourselves and they are accusing us of 
extremism. 
  [Maghniyah] Do you want to establish an Islamic republic in 
Bosnia? And are you really Muslims? 
  [Ganic, after a long silence] This is a cheap question. We 
are Europeans and we believe in our religion and respect all 
other religions. However, Europe's disregard for us has created 
some extremist currents. 
  The Europeans discovered about two years ago that we are 
Muslims. This is why they are not helping us. To confirm this, 
some Muslims in some Islamic countries told us that Europe will 
annihilate us even if we change our names and identities. These 
days, we find some individuals in Bosnia actually becoming 
religious because they are afraid of the results of war. But 
talk about an Islamic republic is not accurate. Only the 
Muslims agree among themselves in Bosnia now; and I believe that 
this will cause future economic problems with all those who are 
fighting the Muslims. As for extremism, I say: Yes, there are 
many hundreds of Muslim fighters who have come from various 
parts of the Islamic world to fight alongside us. But I told 
them to go back home. I said: You are only a few hundred, no 
more. Had you been 50,000, I would have led you into battle in 
the name of Islam. 
  [Maghniyah] Your stance on the Serbs is clear, but it is not 
clear on the Croats. Why is that? 
  [Ganic] No. My stance on the Croats is also clear. We 
fight anyone who follows the policies of Croatian President 
Franjo Tudjman. But there are some Croats fighting alongside 
the Muslims. I tell all the Croats right now: If Bosnia had not 
existed, Croatia would have had to create Bosnia to protect 
itself. Anyone who stands in our way will be dragged along with 
us. We have many options that we have not yet used. We are 
keeping them until the appropriate time. 
  [Maghniyah] What are these methods? 
  [Ganic] I do not want to talk about them. They are forcing 
us into a gangster war. I do not want to add anything more. 
  [Maghniyah] Who are they? 
  [Ganic] The extremist Serbs and Croats. If they push us in 
this direction, no one will be saved. The war will go on for 
many years. Whoever takes land by force will not be able to 
keep it. 
  However, we shall not abandon the principle of negotiations; 
and the way to peace is open to whoever wants to follow it. 
Lord Owen destroyed the theory of "land for peace," as has 
happened in Palestine. We do not want to have any dealings with 
this arrogant Briton. But the problem is that we did not 
appoint him, therefore we cannot dismiss him. He appears on the 
television screens every day, which only makes him more arrogant. 
  [Maghniyah] Do you still want an outlet on Nayum Sea [name 
as published]? 
  [Ganic] Nayum is Bosnian territory. We cannot accept being 
besieged. We want an airport and a port. When I am in an 
airplane and we fly over Bosnia, I see the flames of democracy 
burning here. Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and will always 
be the capital, just as Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine. 
War has caused many woes for everyone in the former Yugoslavia. 
We want these woes to end. We have no other choice, and we 
want an outlet on the sea. If they do not give us this outlet, 
we will drown everyone else along with us. I ask the Arab and 
Islamic countries to put pressure on the United States, France, 
and Britain. There are many ways to boycott Western goods and 
freeze Western projects. I thank the Muslims for standing at 
our side. I tell the Muslims to be careful. There is a great 
deal of discrimination in Europe if you are Muslim. I did not 
know this when I was young because I did not grow up like that. 
But, this is a sad reality.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris </F>
Silajdzic by Ivica Puljic; place and date not given: "Also Open 
for `Others'"] 
  [Text] Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, said the following for OSLOBODJENJE: 
  [Silajdzic] The agreement on federation is the first step 
toward peace and it would not have happened without the 
participation of the United States. All those talks are already 
producing results on the ground. Croatian forces are no longer 
participating in battles around Maglaj and conflicts in central 
Bosnia and Mostar have stopped. That is the most important 
thing. On the ground, with the help of one team made up of 
Americans and other allies, forces must be disengaged and the 
structure of a new Bosnia-Herzegovina army must be created. 
That means we would have a defense alliance with Croatia 
regarding military matters. As far as other things are 
concerned, if God lets us -- all of us living in these parts -- 
come to our senses and establish some sort of peace, then such 
an alliance opens up tremendous possibilities, especially as 
everyone is more willing to invest in peace than in war. 
  [Puljic] Does this agreement foresee a presidential or a 
parliamentary system? 
  [Silajdzic] It will be a combination of parliamentary and 
presidential systems. Regardless of what it will be, I hope it 
will become effective and that it will lead us into either a 
presidential or a parliamentary system. It does not matter what 
it is, as long as it exists. We will try to consider the 
possibility of agreement with the Serbian side. Then we have 
much to do to prepare and draft the constitution of the 
federation and the confederate agreement with Croatia. After we 
have agreed on the text of the constitution and of the agreement 
on confederation, President Izetbegovic and President Tudjman 
are expected to sign a confederate agreement here in Washington. 
  [Puljic] The United States has evidently demonstrated the 
initiative and this could have a very beneficial effect on 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
  [Silajdzic] It is not a coincidence that all this happened 
in the United States and I think Washington is the right place 
for something like that. The seed we planted two years ago is 
slowly shooting. I have always believed Bosnia is a global 
issue and that it can only be solved as such. That is possible 
only if all world factors become involved, and the United States 
is the number-one world factor. You see that there are already 
some results. Our contacts with the United States are on the 
highest level. That is very important, for, in a way, it brings 
balance to those relations. Naturally, when we say world 
factors, we mean others as well. The Russian Federation is one 
of those factors and that is why we will intensify contacts 
directly through the United States in order to reach a final 
solution. I am supposed to go to Moscow and meet with Kosyrev 
and other leading Russian politicians. The Russians are an 
important factor in this process. In Moscow, we will discuss 
the possibility of making an agreement with the Serbian side. 
  Furthermore, I talked to Mr. Juppe, French foreign minister, 
and we understood France would continue to be positively 
involved in solving the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Mr. 
Juppe said he would like to meet with me in Paris and I hope we 
will hold that meeting. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, on the ground, it 
is now most important that the United States and other allies 
help us. They will probably send a good team headed by one of 
the U.S. generals, regarding the disengagement of forces and the 
agreement, first on separation and then also on forming a 
military structure in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Puljic] Is a new world order being created, and to what 
extent is Bosnia-Herzegovina a part of global events? 
  [Silajdzic] Those who doubted the fact that 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is involved in creating a new world order now 
realize they were wrong. That was our thesis from the very 
beginning. Bosnia- Herzegovina is a small country, but it plays 
an important role in international relations and this engagement 
of the United States and the allies, even Russia, proves that. 
You know, regardless of the world order we have, it must be 
founded on some kind of principles and on respecting the order. 
Genocide in the heart of Europe, aggression, the destruction of 
towns.... That is not a world order, that is a disorder that 
will sooner or later lead to war, not only in that region, but 
also in Europe and the world. The new order must be founded on 
the principle of rights and not on the principle of force. If 
it is not so, we will not have any kind of order or world order, 
but world disorder. That is the whole matter. In Bosnia, we 
had to prove there is order and that the order, if disrupted, is 
being established -- by force. That is very important. And 
that is why this is an opportunity not only for the Bosniaks and 
the Croats, not only for Bosnia and Croatia, but also for the 
Serbian side to realize that people must live together in the 
world. That people must talk at a negotiating table and not 
solve problems using guns. This is an opportunity for everybody 
to be included in the peace process. This process includes the 
Bosniaks and the Croats and does not leave anybody out. 
  [Puljic] In case those "others" do not get involved, what 
will happen? 
  [Silajdzic] I hope there will be negotiations, not war. 
  [Puljic] In conclusion, let me ask you whether the United 
States intends to continue to firmly lead the initiative for 
solving the Bosnian problem? 
  [Silajdzic] They definitely intend to do that. Many factors 
decide on that and we are one of those factors. As I said, we 
have been working on involving the United States in this 
historic battle for the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina for two 
years. According to statements by their leaders, the Americans 
will keep supporting Bosnia-Herzegovina. We hope they will keep 
us in the family of democratic countries and nations, that we 
will finally have a free country. There are many victims and, 
unfortunately, we cannot bring back the dead, but I hope those 
people did not die in vain.

recorded comments by Herceg-Bosna Defense Minister Vlado Soljic 
and Herceg-Bosna Prime Minister Jadranko Prlic] 
  [Excerpts] [Sagolj] [Video shows released people on Red 
Cross trucks] These scenes were recorded today on Makljan above 
Prozor where 294 Croats were released from prisons in Bugojno. 
The Croats have released Muslim prisoners from Rodoc. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Video shows correspondent and the government session] The 
Herceg-Bosna Government arrived in Vitez today and held its 
first session here. This is the first time that leaders of the 
Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna have come to Croatian central 
Bosnia. 
  At the beginning of the session, Vice Prime Minister Ante 
Valeta, who lives in Vitez, gave a report on the work of all 
bodies in central Bosnia over the past few months. The 
conclusion was that the political and military leaders of the 
Croat nation of central Bosnia had organized an effective 
defense of their areas. Defense Minister Vlado Soljic stressed: 
  [Soljic] It is enough to say that we have realized the main 
goals if we have the Croatian state as a guarantee for the 
freedom and rights of all Croats, and if we have sovereign 
rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Sagolj] Prime Minister Jadranko Prlic stressed, among other 
things, that all the system's institutions must be further 
strengthened. In connection with that, the government today 
established its tasks. 
  [Prlic] The war has not stopped. The war is not over. In 
that respect, we must remain vigilant. 
  [Sagolj] Minister Mile Akmadzic informed the leaders of 
central Bosnia about the Vienna and Washington Agreements. It 
was particularly stressed at the session that now was the time 
to draw up reconstruction plans, but, of course, without 
neglecting the strengthening of the defense system. [passage

  [Text] The removal of party representatives whose parties 
have fewer than six deputies from the activities of municipal 
war presidencies is an undemocratic act and constitutes the 
first tangible proof of the totalitarianization of the political 
space in Bosnia-Herzegovina, said Rasim Kadic, president of the 
Liberal Party of Bosnia-Herzegovina, at today's news conference. 
The decision was passed by the country's Presidency on the 
proposal of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government and, in my 
opinion, it is politically conflicting. 
  Rasim Kadic warned that this means that parliamentary 
parties 
that had a smaller number of voters will be thrown out of war 
presidencies, while representatives that had not even 
participated in the elections would remain in these executive 
bodies. This is a paradox. Moreover, a part of the text of the 
draft constitution for the federal organization of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is also considered undemocratic. The part in 
question foresees a limit of 5 percent for entering the 
parliament. According to Kadic, this is the introduction of a 
single-party system. He also said that in the majority of 
European countries this limit was set at 2 percent, and that the 
Liberal Party would demand at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly 
that this provision is changed, because it limits the 
development of democracy in these areas.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 21 March carries in its 
regular 6-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in the 
republic. 
  Reporting on the situation in Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says 
that "Karadzic's terrorists and Fikret Abdic's paramilitaries 
have continued to attack the free Bihac territory overnight and 
this morning. The chetniks have been using all their artillery 
and tanks against the defense lines on the Grmusko-Srbljanski 
plateau, Hasin Vrh, (Vrsak), and the Bihac part of the front, 
and they have also occasionally directed their guns at the 
Bosanska Krupa front. They attempted several infantry 
breakthroughs, but these were repulsed by our defenders." He 
says that "in the meantime, the paramilitary formations of the 
so-called Kladusa autonomy attacked the outskirts of Cazin with 
considerable help from the chetniks of the Serbian autonomous 
region of Krajina. The members of the 5th Corps responded to 
the attacks and recaptured some villages that Abdic's 
paramilitaries had temporarily occupied." 
  Emir Aldakovic reports from Bugojno that "all night the town 
shook to the explosions of heavy shells fired from the chetnik 
positions in Kupres and Donji Vakuf. Unable to do anything 
serious on the front line after the major successes of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, when over 40 chetniks were killed in 
just a few days, the chetniks are returning to their tested 
formula of shelling residential areas from a safe distance. The 
shelling of Bugojno and the killing of civilians is aimed at 
encouraging the chetniks at least a little, as total chaos -- 
according to reliable information -- has overtaken their ranks. 
Aware of the failure of their destructive policy and that it is 
only a matter of time before the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army comes 
knocking on the door of Donji Vakuf, or Srbobran as they call 
it, the Serb extremists have been trying their best -- of course 
with the help of unlimited supplies of liquor -- to raise their 
low morale." 
  Enes Ratusic reports from Mostar from the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
4th Corps Press Center that "the last 24 hours have been marked 
by sporadic violations of the cease-fire between the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Croatian Defense Council." As 
for the southern part of the Mostar commune, the reports says 
that "the Serb aggressor fired antiaircraft machine guns and 
guns at Obradovici."

  [Text] The enemy offensive against the area of Bihac is 
continuing unabated. Last night and this morning the Serb 
aggressors opened fire on all defense lines in the Bihac part of 
the battlefield and on the Grmusa-Srbljani plateau. Several 
defenders were killed in the bestial shelling. Karadzic's 
terrorists intensified combat actions in the Bihac region zone 
of responsibility of the Croatian Defense Council, particularly 
in the [name indistinct] part of the battlefield, where they 
tried to infiltrate commando units. The units were routed in an 
energetic action by our fighters, but unfortunately several of 
them were killed in the fighting. 
  Actions by joint forces of the paramilitary formations of 
the 
Kladusa autonomy and chetniks from the so-called Krajina 
continued last night. Using 120-mm mortars, mountain artillery 
pieces and antiaircraft weapons they continued destroying the 
area of Cazin, and the villages of Skrivaja, Viskovac and 
Hatici. A large number of defenders and civilians, who are 
still fleeing this area from Fikret's demented blood-thirsty 
phalanges, were killed in this round of fighting. 
  Also last night, Karadzic's terrorists, using howitzers and 
mortars, shelled Bihac, Cazin, and their suburbs. Two people 
were seriously wounded; eight others suffered only minor 
injuries. Fresh material destruction is considerable.

  [Excerpt] [Announcer] Hajrudin Redzovic reports from the 
Seven-South operational group. 
  [Redzovic] For the first time in the past two years of the 
aggression against our country, the Serb aggressor (?is 
withdrawing) from the operational area of the Seven-South 
operational group [of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army], which has 
recently come under fierce Serb attacks. [Words indistinct] the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's Third Corps, the Croatian Defense 
Council's 111th Zepce Brigade and the command of the Seventh 
South operative group to hand over and liberate the temporarily 
occupied areas from the Bosna River to Mount Crni Vrh and 
further on, the enemy has withdrawn a large part of its forces 
from Novi Seher, Brankovici, Berkovici, Globarica and other 
villages. 
  The aggressors have withdrawn their forces -- two brigades, 
15 tanks, 50 artillery pieces and other military equipment -- 
from villages that have been occupied for nine months. However, 
chetniks still hold some parts of the occupied territories.

  [Text] The blockade of the besieged town of Maglaj and the 
Croatian community of Usora [northeast Bosnia] was lifted at 
1500 today. 
  According to Colonel Ivo Lozancic, the commander of the 
[Bosnian Croat] 111th Brigade, following an ultimatum issued by 
the 111th Brigade Command, the Srpska army today withdrew all 
their military equipment from their lines near Maglaj and the 
roads to Zepce and Usora. They have already reached the 
vicinity of Teslic. The Usora-94 operation was thus 
successfully completed. After several months of blockade the 
Croatian community of Usora is at last linked to the Croats of 
Zepce.

<F P=106> [Hajrudin Sermic report from Maglaj] </F>
  [Text] Events are developing fast in Maglaj. The most 
important news is that last night chetniks withdrew all their 
artillery pieces to the left bank of the Bosna River, to the 
positions on Mount Crni Vrh, near Teslic, where they were 
deployed before 24 June 1993, thus opening the 
Maglaj-Zepce-Zenica road, and a 15-kilometer frontline around 
Maglaj by which they kept this town under siege for more than 
nine months. UN troops are already being deployed along the 
former chetnik positions. 
  A pontoon bridge on the Bosna River near [name indistinct] 
was also dismantled last night. The Serb aggressor used the 
bridge for the transit of weapons and manpower between Mount 
Ozren and Teslic. The Croatian Defense Council has taken over 
the checkpoint on the Maglaj-Zepce road near [name indistinct) 
and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]-mediated negotiations on the 
joint control of the road by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the 
Croatian Defense Council are in progress. It should also be 
said that the Zepce Croatian Defense Council has secured the 
return of 200 inhabitants of this town to their homes, from 
where they were evicted to Maglaj four months ago. [passage

  [Excerpts] Zagreb, March 20 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs have 
agreed to a second aid convoy for the northern Bosnian Moslem 
town of Maglaj as the first one arrived Sunday, providing its 
first supplies since October, a UN official said. The new convoy 
should leave from Zagreb Monday, travelling through the 
Serb-held town of Banja Luka, said Peter Kessler, spokesman for 
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The second 
10-truck run will provide a real test of Serb will to allow 
humanitarian aid for the 100,000 people living in the enclave, 
which has been under Serb siege since mid-1993. [passage omitted] 
  "It's wonderful, we all are very pleased, we finally 
succeeded," said Kris Janowksi, a UNHCR spokesman in Sarajevo. 
Janowski said several additional convoys are scheduled in coming 
days to assist the region's war-weary population, described in a 
recent UN report as walking skeletons. On Sunday, the Bosnian 
Serb army denied Croat reports that it was retreating from 
Maglaj to the town of Teslic, 20 kilometres (12 miles) further 
north-west. Croatian Radio said the withdrawal followed an 
ultimatum by the HVO commander in Zepce, a Croat enclave 20 
kilometres south of Maglaj. In a statement carried by the local 
Serb agency SRNA, a commander of the First Army Corps of the 
self-styled Bosnian Serb Republic described the report as "pure 
disinformation and a propaganda action by the Croat media." Serb 
forces "are not withdrawing and their heavy arms are not 
blocked," said the statement.

as UN officials said that conditions in the Serb-besieged 
enclave were not as dire as reported. [passage omitted] 
  In Sarajevo a spokesman for the UN High Commission for 
Refugees (UNHCR) said the convoy should arrive by Tuesday in the 
town, where things looked somewhat better than expected. "The 
food situation in Maglaj is not as bad as originally reported, 
but the destruction is very considerable. There is not a single 
house without serious damage," spokesman Kris Janowski said at a 
Sarajevo press briefing. The region's war-weary population had 
been described in a recent UN report as walking skeletons. But 
Major Simon Macdowell, UNPROFOR spokesman in Sarajevo, told 
journalists early indications showed that while the situation 
was "far from good" it was "not as desperate as perhaps some 
Bosnian radio reports were making out." "There are no signs of 
ethnic cleansing in the Maglaj region (which) has suffered worst 
from shelling and fighting," he said Monday. 
  Janowski said the second run would provide a real test of 
Serb will to allow humanitarian aid for the 100,000 people 
living in the Moslem-dominated enclave, but the UNHCR was not 
expecting any trouble. Trapped civilians have been forced to 
rely on air drops for aid since ground deliveries were stopped 
five months ago. Larry Hollingworth, head of UNHCR operations 
in Bosnia, reported that the airdrops had been successful "and 
basically kept them alive," said Janowski. 
  Serb forces withdrew Saturday from positions around Maglaj 
after the UN Security Council ordered them to lift their 
nine-month siege on March 14. A group of UN peacekeeping 
soldiers was allowed in on a reconnaissance mission to set up 
the arrival of Sunday's nine-truck convoy from Zenica, which 
carried 80 tonnes of food and medical supplies to Maglaj and the 
nearby besieged town of Tesanj. Several doctors accompanying the 
convoy evacuated nine people "in serious condition (...) injured 
during the recent shelling," said Janowski. 
  Macdowell said it was "still too early" to confirm whether 
rumours of a Bosnian Serb army withdrawal from the region were 
true. "It is still going to take some time until we have more 
freedom of movement, to really be able to assess positions 
around the area," he said. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Zagreb, March 20 (AFP) -- An aid convoy reached 
the Moslem town of Maglaj in northern Bosnia Sunday, providing 
the first such shipment to the town's population of 16,000 since 
October, UN officials said. The nine-truck convoy, escorted by 
UN armored vehicles, was carrying 80 tonnes of food and medical 
supplies and included several doctors who hoped to bring out 
from the enclave some 20 people in need of medical attention. 
  Peter Kessler, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for 
refugees, said the relief convoy left the town of Zenica early 
Saturday [19 March] and travelled the 70 kilometres (43 miles) 
to Maglaj without encountering any obstacles from Bosnian Serb 
troops besieging the Moslem enclave. He said the convoy reached 
Maglaj shortly after 1330 GMT only to discover a devastated city 
with only a few buildings left standing. "There are almost no 
buildings left that have not been destroyed by the Serbs," said 
Kessler. "It looks like Vukovar." Vukovar is the eastern 
Croatian city destroyed by the former Yugoslav army in 1991.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 19 (TANJUG) -- Fighting between 
Bosnian Moslems and Croats continued on Saturday although their 
leaders signed a federation deal in Washington on Friday. The 
Zagreb-based Croatian radio said Moslem troops were attacking 
Croat positions around Kiseljak in central Bosnia from small 
arms and anti-aircraft guns. The same source said the situation 
in the Mostar area was calm on Saturday. The Moslem-controlled 
Radio Sarajevo, on the other hand, reported continuous small 
arms attacks on the Moslem section of Mostar. Moslem attacks on 
Serb positions in central and northern Bosnia also continued on 
Saturday. Bosnian Serb military sources in the area of Srbobran 
(formerly Donji Vakuf) reported Moslem provocations from the 
direction of Bugojno, central Bosnia. The Moslem troops on that 
section of the front have been regrouping over the past 24 
hours, the sources said and added that the local authorities in 
Srbobran had ordered all public institutions and schools to 
suspend work in the expectation of a Moslem attack. 
  The Bosnian Serb army said the strongest Moslem attacks were 
reported in the Trebava river valley to the northeast of Doboj. 
The Moslem infantry attacks were successfully repulsed and the 
enemy was forced to retreat, the same source said and added that 
the Moslems were regrouping and bringing in reinforcements from 
Gracanica east of Doboj. A Moslem commando team attempting an 
infiltration into the area south of Doboj was successfully 
neutralized on Friday night, the Bosnian Serb army said and 
added that two commandoes were killed after stepping on a mine 
while retreating and that several others were seriously wounded.

  [Excerpt] A group of 866 prisoners of war were released 
today from Muslim prisons and prisons runs by the Croat Defense 
Council [HVO]. Members of the HVO who were held in Bugojno have 
arrived in Mostar as well. Zdenko Vranjes reporting. 
  [Begin reporting] [Vranjes] In today's exchange the Croat 
side released 500 captured members of the Muslim army from the 
prison in Rodoc near Mostar. This afternoon they crossed over 
to the [Muslim-held] eastern part of Mostar, some of them went 
to Jablanica, and 20 went to their homes in the [Croat-held] 
western part of Mostar. 
  The Muslim side released 72 captured HVO members from 
prisons 
in the eastern part of Mostar and 294 from the prison in 
Bugojno. The former prisoners crossed from the eastern to the 
western part of the town this afternoon. Released prisoners 
from Bugojno have also arrived in Mostar this evening. 
  Berislav Pusic, the representative of the Herzeg-Bosna 
office 
for the exchange of prisoners and searches for the missing, 
assessing that today's exchange fully honored the agreement on 
the exchange reached yesterday, noted that the exchange 
according to the all-for-all principle would continue as early 
as 21 March, and that it would go on until the last captured or 
imprisoned person of either side is released. 
  [Pusic] We still want 53 residents of Bugojno who are on our 
list of missing people. We have managed to locate some of them 
in prisons in Travnik and Zenica. I cannot give their names now 
because I do not know them, but they will be [word indistinct] 
in the next 10 days. We will continue searching for other 
Croats who were arrested in Bugojno when the town fell. [end

the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who today, through the 
mediation of the Red Cross and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], 
were set free after having spent several months in prison. 
  The meetings with relatives and friends (?who waited for 
them 
anxiously) are difficult to describe. In the first group, this 
afternoon, 178 former inmates arrived [in the Muslim-held part 
of Mostar]. Twenty-two persons, in accordance with their own 
wishes, were sent to the right bank [as heard] of the city, 
which is under the control of the HVO [Croatian Defense 
Council], while 12 of those freed went to Jablanica. At any 
moment a second group of prisoners should arrive, so that the 
agreement on their release can be fully implemented. [passage

  [Text] Petrovac, March 20 (TANJUG) -- NATO planes on Sunday 
violated air space in a show of force over western part of the 
Bosnian Serb Republic (S.R.) by taking reconnaissance flights 
over Serb positions. The planes strafed the area, terrorizing 
the population in the areas of Kljuc, Drvar, Petrovac, 
Krupa-on-the-Una and the Serb municipality of Bihac. Moslem 
forces over the past 24 hours continuously mounted fierce 
attacks on this part of the battlefront, Bosnian Serb military 
sources have said. Serb forces keep all front lines under 
control and respond to attacks only if necessary and in case 
when their property and lives of fighters are being threatened. 
The Bosnian Serb Army has had no casualties in the fighting. 
  Moslem forces have continued regrouping on the Srbobran 
(formerly Gornji Vakuf) battlefront, in central Bosnia, Serb 
military sources said. Despite strong Moslem attacks launched on 
Srbobran from Bugojno during the past week, trucks of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have shipped off, 
via Srbobran, 600 tonnes of food for Moslems in central Bosnia, 
the same sources said. Moslem forces have again staged 
provocations against Serb positions towards Cajnice (south of 
Mostar) and Konjic (north of Mostar), local Serb military 
sources said. In western Bosnia-Herzegovina, fierce inter-Moslem 
clashes continue between loyalists of hardline Moslem leader 
Alia Izetbegovic and his moderate rival Fikret Abdic, leader of 
the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia.

missing. In the area of 61 municipalities, 162,341 have been 
wounded, 72,532 of whom sustained serious injuries. In this 
time, 16,538 children have been killed, and another 33,805 have 
been wounded. Of this number, 18,814 have been seriously 
wounded, states the Republican Headquarters for Healthcare and 
Social Security of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In Sarajevo, 9,900 people 
were killed, while another 58,160 were wounded. Of these, 
18,814 people sustained severe injuries. Of the killed, 1,564 
were children. Another 14,814 children were injured, 3,349 of 
them seriously. 
  In the past week, 6,576 cases of infectious diseases were

majority of cases, followed by influenza and infectious 
hepatitis. Medical equipment and expert medical teams are most 
needed in the areas where the aggressor continues to attack 
fiercely. In accordance with the normalization of the 
situation, preparations have begun for the return of displaced 
persons within the country, and of those from other countries. 
The number of Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees has climbed to

affairs and prime minister-designate, by Ivan Stulajter; place 
and date not given: "Michal Kovac's Course of Action During the 
Meeting With Bill Clinton Was in No Way Unusual"] 
  [Text] [Stulajter] Speaking about the meeting of 
representatives of the Visegrad Four countries with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton in Prague, in his address to the National 
Council of the Slovak Republic on Friday [11 March], Vladimir 
Meciar said that this was an opportunity to "tackle the security 
and economic interests of the Slovak Republic, to tackle 
cooperation and bilateral relations between the United States 
and Slovakia. We had worked out a great deal in this regard, 
but, out of 40 minutes [reserved for the meeting], President 
Kovac had reserved 34 minutes for himself, for a one-sided 
speech prepared in writing. I did not have a chance." From the 
viewpoint of protocol, what role was assigned to the prime 
ministers of the Visegrad Four countries at the talks with Bill 
Clinton? 
  [Moravcik] I do not know how the other representatives of 
the Visegrad Four countries conducted their talks. It is quite 
common in diplomatic practice that the main and sometimes 
exclusive role at talks is played by the delegation head, which 
was the president of the Slovak Republic. 
  [Stulajter] Which subject matters did the talks with the 
U.S. President touch upon? 
  [Moravcik] The talks focused on issues concerning security, 
participation in the Partnership for Peace project, Slovakia's 
foreign policy orientation, open foreign policy problems, and 
the expansion of bilateral relations. 
  [Stulajter] Would it have been possible to sign any 
documents in Prague? 
  [Moravcik] No signing of documents had been planned. 
  [Stulajter] Was Slovak President Michal Kovac's course of 
action during the talks with Bill Clinton unusual in any way, 
compared with the normal practice? 
  [Moravcik] I do not consider anything that happened unusual. 
  [Stulajter] How do you assess the visit from your point of 
view? 
  [Moravcik] The talks fulfilled the basic aim. They 
emphasized our interest in integration into the Euro-Atlantic 
security system, our acceptance of the offer to participate in 
the Partnership for Peace project, and our interest in the 
development of bilateral relations, especially in the sphere of 
economic cooperation.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] At the beginning of today's 
parliament session, Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik first 
introduced the members of his Cabinet, with the exception of two 
who are abroad. 
  Then he delivered a short speech that focused on the chief 
objectives of the new Slovak Government: 
  [Begin Moravcik recording] Everyone who was born in 
Slovakia, 
everyone who lives here and considers Slovakia his or her 
homeland, is, for us, a loyal citizen of this state. The 
government will protect his or her freedom and democratic 
rights, including the right to criticize the government. 
  I would like to emphasize, in this respect, that it is 
against our national interests if people are divided because of 
their nationality, ethnic group, or any other allegiance. 
  We consider it necessary to create space for the initiative 
of individual citizens, particularly in the economy. The 
advancement of business is a prerequisite and a guarantee for 
prosperity of democratic society. To create space for 
individual initiative means, above all, to continue economic 
transformations more effectively. The state still owns too many 
enterprises. Privatization is part of solving economic problems 
in society. When privatization gets out of hand and all ethical 
values are negated, the result is wild privatization, a wolfish 
struggle instead of an organized procedure. This, undoubtedly, 
deepens the crisis of ethical values in society. 
  If the government is to support business, the state's 
financial system must be completed. Among other things, this 
means abandoning putting excessive emphasis on the fiscal angle 
and creating space for individual initiative. 
  Social security is an area with acute problems. There is a 
need to emphasize greater individual responsibility for social 
security of individuals. When this individual responsibility 
fails, state support takes over. In this system, too, it is 
necessary to reserve a greater space for the involvement of 
specialist nonstate institutions, endowments, and charitable 
institutions. 
  The development of the nonprofit sector reinforces civic 
solidarity, which should be important to us. 
  More significant progress in creating a new image of 
Slovakia, along the lines I have mentioned, cannot be 
implemented without the advancement of science and education. 
Education is an important value and a guarantee for future 
prosperity. We are losing speed in this area. We cannot go on 
delaying finding solutions to the problems in this area. 
  I would also like to speak briefly about the foreign 
political aspects of the government's policy. I would like to 
say clearly that Slovakia's foreign political strategy is not 
changing from the concept endorsed by the Slovak parliament. I 
will promote those elements that lead to deepening cooperation 
with and integration into European economic, political, and 
security systems and groups. In the same way, we shall 
accentuate our interest in good-neighborly relations with the 
neighbors of Slovakia. 
  What we need for this policy to succeed is to make our 
internal policy credible. Not everything I have mentioned can 
be secured and fulfilled in the time available to this 
government. This government is to get Slovakia to early 
parliamentary elections. We are prepared to make full use of 
the time to create foundations for development in the directions 
I have outlined.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef </F>
Moravcik by Joana Radzyner on 18 March; place not given; 
Moravcik speaks in Slovak with superimposed German 
translation--recorded] 
  [Text] [Radzyner] There are only six months to go before 
the new elections. However, the new head of government is 
confident that there is time enough to convince the Slovak 
population of its work. It was not primarily a rejection of 
former Prime Minister Meciar that united five former opposition 
parties but, rather, a common political concept, Jozef Moravcik 
pointed out. 
  [Moravcik] All five political parties see the need to 
accelerate the process of economic transformation and to press 
ahead with European integration. All five want to develop a 
political culture that is based on the principles of democracy 
adopted by the November revolution in 1989. This political 
culture will help us in our communication with our partners in 
Europe and on the other side of the Atlantic. 
  [Radzyner] In the sphere of domestic policies, these new 
principles mean, above all, Slovakia's recognition as a society 
with different ethnic groups, in which the members of the 
Hungarian minority will become Slovak citizens with equal 
rights. Still, Moravcik has not appointed a representative of 
the Hungarian minority as a Cabinet member. Was he afraid of 
Meciar? Meciar has already denounced the new government as the 
traitor of the true interests of the true Slovaks. 
  [Moravcik] It is true that we took this into consideration. 
After all, we do not want to trigger a new wave of nationalism. 
This would be in contradiction with our political goals. 
  [Radzyner] Moravcik claims that he has excellent relations 
with Czech Prime Minister Klaus, who was the last Czechoslovak 
foreign minister. In Budapest, the new tones regarding the 
Hungarian minority will certainly initiate good relations.

  [Text] The change of government in Slovakia has evoked a 
positive response abroad, Eduard Kukan, the new foreign 
minister, said in the "Kroky" TV program. 
  Regarding relations with neighboring countries, he said that 
he is not very optimistic about whether it will be possible for 
the government to comprehensively resolve relations with the 
Czech Republic and Hungary during its six months in office. A 
peaceful atmosphere, however, must be created first of all. 
  As to the U.S. press, he noted that it views Slovakia as a 
naughty child. That is why it is the role of the new diplomacy 
to provide an objective picture of Slovakia.

<F P=106> [Interview with new Slovak Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus by </F>
an unidentified correspondent at the Bratislava Castle in 
Bratislava on 16 March--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Minister, what do you regard are 
the most sensitive issues facing you in your new job? 
  [Filkus] It is certainly the budget. I am not saying that we 
shall have to revise it. We shall nonetheless have to subject 
it to an appraisal from the viewpoint of revenues and 
expenditure. The situation in sectors that are dependent solely 
on revenues they receive from the state budget, such as the 
health, educational, and cultural sectors, is especially bad. 
We shall have to take another look at them. [passage omitted] 
  The problem I shall have to start tackling beginning 
tomorrow 
is to report to the public and signal to it that I have taken 
over the economy in such a state, with such currency reserves, 
such a budget deficit, such a degree of unemployment, such a 
relationship between the growth of labor productivity and wages. 
My task will be to inform the public about macroeconomic 
options we have. 
  [Correspondent] What kind of picture have you formed about 
steps you shall have to take regarding the very burning problem 
of the stability of money? 
  [Filkus] First, I believe the center that is to look after 
the stability of money is the National Bank. It possesses basic 
macroeconomic criteria with which it can judge what to do or not 
do within the framework of the stability. You must surely have 
in mind the process of devaluation and the like. This must be 
done by the bank in accordance with its own judgement. The 
Finance Ministry ought not to interefere in this matter. The 
Finance Ministry may give assistance, but the consideration and 
decision should be made by the National Bank only in accordance 
with the criteria the bank has at its disposal. No one should 
interefere in this process.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Slovak newspapers on 17 March publish 
reports indicating that the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
[HZDS] is considering launching a referendum on the expression 
of no-confidence in President Kovac. 
  Bratislava SME in Slovak on 17 March on page 1, under the 
headline "Meciar in Favor of a Fourth Referendum Question," 
carries a 150-word unattributed report on HZDS Chairman Vladimir 
Meciar's reaction to the announcement by the Presidential Office 
that the HZDS-initiated petition for a referendum failed to 
collect the required number of 350,000 "valid" signatures. The 
report states: "Vladimir Meciar said yesterday, `I know from 
reliable sources that 368,000 valid citizens [as published] had 
expressed themselves in favor of the referendum. However, 
because they [officials from the legislative department of the 
Presidential Office] said that giving the place of residence is 
not enough and that the term place of residence must be 
understood to include the street and the exact address, they 
managed to pull down the number to under 300,000, to only 
slightly over 200,000. Such an explanation of the shortage [of 
signatures] and termination of the operation amounts to contempt 
for the law and the citizen.' Asked what the further course of 
action by the HZDS would be, Vladimir Meciar replied, `There 
will be another petition, this time with a fourth question.'" 
  Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 17 March on page 2, 
under the headline "Another Referendum in Slovakia?," carries 
the following TA SR report: "A referendum in which citizens 
ought to express their confidence in President Michal Kovac is 
demanded by some HZDS district organizations, a TA SR 
correspondent learned from reliable sources. Even though the 
HZDS leadership has not yet decided whether and when a 
referendum with such contents should be held, petition 
committees have already been set up in some districts."

<F P=106> [Interview with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic by </F>
Jose Ramiro Villapadierna in Zagreb; date not given] 
  [Text] Zagreb -- "You must speak with Granic; he is the 
best politician and the best person I have found in this war," 
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic recently urged ABC. 
Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic is intelligent and 
cautious, does not flinch under fire when asked about his 
government's many inconsistencies in Bosnia, and does not 
believe in any Bosnian fundamentalism. "My spokesman will have 
told you that out of the dozens of interviews for which I have 
been requested over the past few days your newspaper is the only 
one that I am going to receive," he explained before going to 
Washington for the final signing of the agreement. 
  [Villapadierna] Why has Zagreb fought more for Herzegovina 
-- part of another country -- than for eastern Slavonia itself, 
which remains occupied? 
  [Granic] The foremost aim of Croatian policy is the real 
reintegration of the occupied areas within the Croatian state's 
legal and economic framework. When the UN Protection Forces' 
mandate ends, President Tudjman will send Butrus-Ghali our plan 
for reintegration on the basis of the existing resolutions. We 
wish to extend the air exclusion order to the occupied areas of 
Croatia and for it also to include an ultimatum in order to 
monitor the borders, as the resolutions stipulate. Regarding 
what you say about Herzegovina, I will remind you that the plan 
for a greater Serbia, against Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
produced its strongest reaction precisely in Herzegovina. 
Without that reaction, there would not be a single free 
territory in Bosnia today. 
  [Villapadierna] What has changed for you people and the 
Muslims to cease killing each other on the Neretva? 
  [Granic] The conditions for the current agreement (between 
Bosnian Croats and Muslims) were being created for a long time 
in lengthy secret negotiations which began 14 September, and 
Croatia finally deemed the time ripe to accept and fully support 
this. Then it was a matter of finding strong international 
support, and this was Washington. The talks in Vienna have 
ended successfully, and the military agreement has been signed 
and will be ratified in Washington Friday, but nothing would 
have been possible without the United States. 
  [Villapadierna] What is the significance of the other 
agreement with Belgrade, whose forces are still invading your 
country? 
  [Granic] Croatia also wants a final normalization of 
relations, but with acceptance of its territorial integrity. 
The rapidity of that normalization will depend on Belgrade's 
attitude to the occupied territories and its observance of the 
resolutions. Only, communications have been restored and we can 
talk, and this represents an impetus to the commission seeking 
the 7,500 missing persons. 
  [Villapadierna] Have you no guarantee of extending sanctions 
until reintegration? 
  [Granic] We will continue to demand this. The total 
harmonization of thinking with U.S. ideas is our best guarantee. 
Croatia is prepared to speak with Croatia's Serbs within the 
framework of what is laid down by the Security Council, to cease 
firing immediately, and to establish transport and 
communications. Everybody now wishes to support a final peaceful 
solution; Churkin was here yesterday. Croatia is at its best 
point internationally. 
  [Villapadierna] Will there be a referendum on the 
federation in Bosnia? 
  [Granic] Everybody is in agreement on the federation except 
some people in the Serbian National Party. Regarding the 
confederation, our Constitution requires two-thirds of the Sabor 
and then a referendum. 
  [Villapadierna] Can a southern Slav country be like 
Switzerland? 
  [Granic] We have studied many models with the best U.S. and 
European legislators, but the main thing is not the cantons but 
the political agreement and equal rights for Croats and Muslims. 
Economically, Bosnia has been destroyed. It will need special 
assistance from the world; there are good signs of this. On the 
Islamic side, it is cheaper to help reconstruction than to send 
arms; on the European side, it is between 10 and 20 times 
cheaper to send back the refugees and help them here. And the 
economy is always a good reason. 
  [Villapadierna] Will the "Srpska republic" be deactivated? 
  [Granic] We have offered them entry into the confederation 
on the same terms. No concessions will be made on human rights. 
  [Villapadierna] Are the United States and Russia alone able 
to restore peace to the Balkans? Has Europe thwarted their 
hopes? 
  [Granic] It is very complex. Europe is very interested in 
this region -- the European powers are our neighbors. On my 
recent tour I secured considerable agreement on our negotiation 
and the resolution of the conflict, but Europe has no 
instruments or strong machinery: It cannot stop the Serbian 
aggression. The European conglomeration represents wealth, but 
also weakness. That is why we have dwelt on U.S. support so 
much. 
  [Villapadierna] Why did the alleged German interests in 
Yugoslavia prove so unacceptable for the same Europe which now 
accepts the Russian intervention and interests in Serbia? 
  [Granic] Throughout this period, Germany's stance has been 
very positive, especially in the humanitarian sense, and in 
promoting dialogue between Croats and Muslims. On the Russian 
presence, most of the powers agree on the influence which they 
exert over the Serbs. Germany has no influence over the Serbs, 
but it does over Russia. In addition, Russia's particular 
interest in the Balkans must be accepted. 
  [Villapadierna] Why did Zagreb betray its alliance with 
Sarajevo, only to sign the confederation agreement after 
thousands of deaths? 
  [Granic] Write that I utterly disagree with that, and I have 
been following this conflict for a long time. Since the 
aggression against Croatia, we have offered them a military 
alliance. I am saying this for the first time. The situation 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina was very difficult, surrounded on all 
sides, but they should have taken their decision earlier. 
Croatia supported independence, because the agreement was a 
decentralized country with equal rights for everybody. The 
(Bosnian) Croats were the best organized to defend their 
territory, and the Muslims received their first weapons from 
Croatia. 
  [Villapadierna] The first convoys of weapons to defend 
Srebrenica were also stopped by the Croats. 
  [Granic] What some Croat troops did with the Muslim convoys, 
the destruction of Mostar, or the massacres of Achmici and 
Stupni Dol, are another matter. I can also give you around 40 
instances of the Muslims. On many occasions, it was Croats and 
Muslims together who stopped the convoys. 
  [Villapadierna] People paid by secret services to worsen the 
conflict? 
  [Granic] Clearly. It is strange that many of these crimes 
were covered immediately by some television channels such as 
CNN, while others which were much bloodier were not mentioned: 
There were interests. I assure you that what we are going to 
sign is the same thing that Tudjman and I proposed back in 
August without much response. 
  [Villapadierna] President Izetbegovic also offered a 
confederation in Geneva. 
  [Granic] This desire existed on both sides, but I tell you: 
I wish to speak to you not of specific mistakes -- that is 
history -- but of a global strategy. You know that the Muslims 
are not a homogeneous body: The majority are in favor of full 
cooperation with the Croats, but others are in favor of a 
separate Islamic state. 
  [Villapadierna] Have you won support for your agreement in 
Moscow? 
  [Granic] Moscow has been very active: The Serbs will join 
in the negotiations.

  [Text] Knin, 20 Mar (TANJUG) -- Djordje Bjegovic, prime 
minister of the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK), tendered his 
irrevocable resignation to the position of prime minister at a 
session of Krajina's assembly today. 
  Under the RSK Constitution, the prime minister's resignation 
entails the resignation of the whole government, which will 
however remain in power until a new government is elected.

  [Text] On its second day of work, the assembly of the 
republic of Serbian Krajina, [words indistinct] false 
accusations against the Krajina government increased so much 
that the conflict between the government and the parliament was 
resolved by Prime Minister Djordje Bjegovic tendering the 
cabinet's resignation to the deputies. Here is our special 
correspondent Dragoljub Stankic reporting from Knin: 
  [Begin recording] [Stankic] Differences were expressed 
yesterday by the refusal of the opposition, the Serbian 
Democratic Party of Krajina and the Serbian Radicals, to accept 
that the government's ordinances have legal force, something 
that immediately brought the Krajina judicial system to a 
complete state of paralysis. The vote of no-confidence in 
Information Minister Milena Tanjga -- without deviating from the 
legal period of time from the no-confidence motion to the [word 
indistinct] -- came to a head during the morning session when 
deputes of the coalition opposed the government's report on the 
recent term, presented by Prime Minister Djordje Bjegovic. The 
solution does not lie in reproaches; the point is to make the 
[word indistinct] under these conditions, said Bjegovic, 
attempting to somehow calm things down in the Assembly. 
However, if one adds here that the joint coalition was from the 
very beginning opposed to the new prime minister-designate, 
Borisav Mikelic, as well to most other issues, it is then clear 
that things could be solved only with the resignation of the 
entire cabinet. 
  We asked Prime Minister Djordje Bjegovic to briefly comment 
on his resignation for Belgrade Radio. 
  [Bjegovic] Well, I think that in this situation it was 
necessary to cut short the debate. I do not think that false 
accusations are ever useful and particularly not to the republic 
of Serbian Krajina and its people, who are suffering for the 
fourth year already. It is good that we had parliamentary 
elections and a multiparty system, but some rules of human 
behavior must exist. I think that there has been smearing and 
spitting on the government both in the case of the former 
parliament and this one, although I think that it is the only 
body in republic of Serbian Krajina that has functioned, more or 
less. 
  It was my human duty to come before the parliament as a 
deputy and I think I performed my duty to the extent that it was 
possible to do so. My entire cabinet made an effort to do its 
duty. Working under difficult conditions, I think that we 
nevertheless maintained a certain minimum of system and 
organization. I was particularly concerned with the question of 
how to solve the organizational situation. I must say with 
pleasure that (?this one step) was overcome and now we have all 
[word indistinct], all state institutions. I expect the new 
parliament to do the same, as these committees should take care 
of the law, the legal procedure, and by no means encroach on 
executive power. If this is understood, then a division of 
duties will be accomplished. What should definitely be accepted 
in the end is the communal system plan, that is to say, a law on 
territorial organization in which [words indistinct]. In this 
way, we will have a real infrastructure and I am certain we will 
be successful. On the basis of everything I have heard today, I 
can say that there are many clever people here, but it is 
certain that this party [word indistinct] is above them and that 
it is almost dictating to them. I would not like to dictate to 
anybody to do what is smart, he should decide for himself. I 
think that it is most important to also create a financial 
model, that is, economic prosperity for the republic of Serbian 
Krajina. I am sure that there is room for us in a joint Serbian 
state and I am sure that we shall [words indistinct). 
  [Stankic] We should also say that after Milan Martic, 
president of the republic of Serbian Krajina, and the new 
Assembly were elected, the Krajina government became a regular 
offender. The parliamentary majority treated the government as a 
political opponent, and attacks abounded regardless of the 
evidence. The attacks on government projects, against Milena 
Tanjga, and Borislav Mikelic are in fact the coalition's attack 
against President Milan Martic. The government's (?resignation) 
is nothing but a ruse by the parliamentary majority, because 
according to the Constitution, the government can now function 
unhindered until a new cabinet is elected. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Dragoljub Stankic from Knin] </F>
  [Text] The assembly of the republic of Serbian Krajina 
delayed its meeting today by more than three hours. They were 
allegedly waiting for Krajina Radio and Television to carry out 
technical preparations for a live relay of the session. 
However, the situation is such that earlier disagreements 
between the government and the assembly have now reached their 
peak. This is demonstrated by the proposed agenda; it has been 
proposed to the Krajina assembly deputies to debate the already 
established prime minister-designate. Let us recall: Milan 
Martic, president of the republic of Serbian Krajina, took 
advantage of his constitutional powers and informed the assembly 
chairman in writing that he should appoint Borislav Mikelic 
prime minister-designate. Mikelic was director of the Petrinja 
Gavrilovic Combine for years and then the deputy director of the 
Progres Enterprise. Assembly Chairman Branko Vojnica is only 
supposed to inform assembly deputies of this, the debate will be 
held only after the prime minister designate informs them about 
the new cabinet. 
  The coalition of the Serbian Democratic Party of Krajina and 
the Serbian Radical Party opposed the first prime minister from 
the very beginning, so a heated argument on this is expected at 
today's session. However, the majority orientation both in Knin 
and throughout Krajina is that Borislav Mikelic should be prime 
minister-designate because of his good and correct relations 
with the Serbian leadership, as well as strong business links 
with new Serbian prime minister Mirko Marjanovic. The coalition 
of the Serbian Democratic Party of Krajina and Serbian Radicals 
want to overcome this situation by entering onto the agenda the 
formation of a parliamentary delegation that would leave for 
talks with the Serbian president. 
  Foreign Minister Slobodan Jarcevic is also expected to 
present the government's proposal for the platform for talks 
with the Croatian delegation in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb on 
22 March. 
  On the agenda are also amendments to several laws: on the 
Krajina Radio and Television, the Serbian army of Krajina, as 
well as a package of financial laws.

  [Excerpt] Knin, 18 Mar (TANJUG) -- The Executive Committee 
of the Serb Democratic Party of Krajina [SDSK], chaired by 
former Krajina President Milan Babic, today rejected a proposal 
put forward by Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serb 
Krajina, to appoint Borislav Mikelic as prime minister of the 
new Krajina government, this party announced today. 
  The announcement says that the appointment of Borislav 
Mikelic as the new RSK government's prime minister-designate 
represents an act of ignoring the will of the parliamentary 
majority, which is a constitutional obligation and common 
practice in parliamentary democracies throughout the world. 
  It has also been said that this party was in favor of a 
national unity government, "remaining open to negotiations on 
the composition of the government with all political factors, 
which is in the national interest." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kragujevac, 20 Mar (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic, 
president of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], told Radio 
Kragujevac today that the Serbs in the RSK will not renounce 
their right to self-determination and that "this is the minimum 
below which we will not go in any talks dealing with the fate of 
the Serb nation, including the Zagreb talks scheduled for 
Tuesday." 
  Taking part in the Hallmark of the Times program on Radio 
Kragujevac, Martic said that claims that Serbia has given up on 
Krajina are pure speculation. 
  He stressed that the talks in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb 
are useful for many reasons: They are to be held on neutral 
territory, equality in talks has been ensured and, most 
important, the door has been opened for the RSK to join 
international negotiations on the former Yugoslavia. 
  Asked about his views on the role of the Russian side, which 
is sponsoring the talks, Martic said Russian diplomacy has an 
important role in stabilizing the situation in the Balkans and 
in establishing peace. 
  He said the Washington agreement between the Muslims and 
Croats was the result of the U.S. initiative which should secure 
long-term U.S. interests in the Balkans. 
  The RSK president believes that the [Croat-Muslim] alliance 
will not last long. "The alliance will make the RSK's position 
difficult for a while, but no one can return the RSK to Croatia 
by force," Martic stressed. 
  Our fate depends most on the determination and readiness for 
further efforts and pressures which will follow both in the 
sphere of diplomacy and defense.

  [Text] The president of the Republic of Croatia forwarded a 
letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on 16 March 
concerning the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] mandate in 
Croatia, which expires on 31 March. President Tudjman's letter 
was published in New York as an official document of the 
Security Council under S/1994/305. The letter is quoted in its 
entirety: ``On 31 March 1994 the existing mandate of the 
UNPROFOR will expire, leaving the Security Council with the 
option of extending if for an additional period of six months. 
The Republic of Croatia praises the UN soldiers and civilian 
personnel for all of the efforts they have made in their 
difficult mission of peace in Croatia. We are grateful for 
their devoted humanitarian effort, which has helped many 
citizens of Croatia, and we deeply regret the casualties which 
the international forces have suffered in their brave task. 
  "The Republic of Croatia is once again ready to accept 
prolongation of the UNPROFOR mandate on its territory, 
considering the pivotal role of UNPROFOR in the overall process. 
However, in making its final decision regarding the renewal of 
the UNPROFOR mandate, the Government of Croatia must raise the 
question of the necessity of improving UNPROFOR's performance. 
Full implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions 
remains the most essential, yet still unfulfilled, task of 
UNPROFOR. With more than 16,000 UN peace-keeping troops 
deployed in Croatia, and considering the precise goals inscribed 
in the Vance plan (S/23280, annex III), it is difficult to 
accept the inefficiency of UNPROFOR performance in Croatia. The 
uncooperative and hostile behavior of militant Serbian 
insurgents in the UN Protected Areas (UNPAs) certainly is a 
cause of considerable difficulties for UNPROFOR, but they should 
not be permitted to impede the implementation of any Security 
Council resolutions. Security Council Resolution No. 871 (1993) 
of 4 October 1993 remains the foundation for any future UNPROFOR 
action in Croatia, as well as the overall framework for 
initiating the process of the peaceful reintegration of the 
UNPAs into the legal and economic system of the Republic of 
Croatia. Croatia stresses in particular the importance of 
paragraphs 4 and 5 of Security Council Resolution No. 871 
(1993). 
  "The full normalization of the position of the international 
community toward the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and 
Montenegro) must be preconditioned on the sincere cooperation of 
its government in the full and prompt implementation of the UN 
peace-keeping plan for the Republic of Croatia. This includes 
the provisions of the plan concerning the demilitarization of 
the UNPAs, as well as the recognition of the Republic of Croatia 
within its internationally recognized borders. In dealing with 
the question of the UNPAs, the Republic of Croatia would like to 
recall General Assembly Resolution No. 48/122 of 20 December 
1993 entitled `Human Rights and Terrorism.' Actions of the 
Serbian insurgents in the UNPAs can clearly be characterized as 
terrorist acts, aimed at the destruction of human rights, 
threatening the territorial integrity of the Republic of 
Croatia, destabilizing the legitimately constituted Government 
of Croatia, undermining a pluralistic civil society and having 
serious consequences on the economic and social development of 
Croatia. Therefore, we call upon the Security Council to 
consider, in its future deliberations on the problems of the 
UNPAs, the hostile actions of the Serbian insurgents to be acts 
of terrorism. The Republic of Croatia remains fully committed 
to the peace process, and it is ready to cooperate with UNPROFOR 
in the fulfillment of its difficult mandate. 
  "As well as Security Council resolutions, the major 
guideline 
in our approach toward the achievement of a peaceful settlement 
in the Republic of Croatia remains the European Union Action 
Plan. Croatia is dedicated to remaining an element of stability 
and security in the region, in close cooperation with the United 
Nations. At the same time, I must once again emphasize the 
extreme importance of successful implementation of all the 
relevant Security Council resolutions for the rapid and peaceful 
reintegration of the UNPAs into the legal and political system 
of the Republic of Croatia. This is the only guarantee for peace 
and stability in the region. In order to facilitate future 
UNPROFOR performance, and considering the situation on the 
ground, I am enclosing a series of goals and actions which 
Croatia considers to be necessary for the success of the renewed 
UNPROFOR mandate."

94 tonnes of food and medical supplies left here Monday [21 
March] heading for the Moslem enclave of Maglaj in northern 
Bosnia, UN officials reported. 
  The 10-truck convoy was expected to cross by midday the 
Gradiska Bridge, linking Croatia and Bosnia, and continue on 
toward the beseiged enclave via Banja Luka, the main city in 
northern Bosnian under Serb control. 
  Another convoy reached the city Sunday delivering 80 tonnes 
of supplies, the first to reach the beleaguered city in five 
months. Shortly thereafter Bosnian Serb leaders had given their 
approval for another convoy to reach the city, Peter Kessler, 
spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said. He 
said the latest convoy would amount to a real "test" on the 
Serbs' apparent willingness to allow much-needed aid to reach 
the pocket's 100,000 population.

Gylys, the foreign ministers of Poland and Lithuania, today 
initialed in Warsaw the "Treaty Between the Polish Republic and 
the Republic of Lithuania on Friendly Relations and Neighborly 
Cooperation." Both ministers underscored the great importance 
of this fact to Poland and Lithuania as well as to the entire 
region. 
  The ministers announced that the text of the treaty would be 
published only after it is signed by the presidents of Poland 
and Lithuania, which is to take place in April. 
  "Treaties open the future and do not refer to the past," 
Minister Olechowski said during the ceremony. He added that 
there had been different, some better and some worse, chapters 
in the history of Polish-Lithuanian relations, but initialing 
and signing the treaty would open a new "wonderful and rich" 
chapter in relations between both states. 
  Minister Olechowski assured journalists that there were no 
reasons for concern that the treaty did not guarantee the rights 
of the Polish minority in Lithuania. 
  Minister Gylys said that, at the outset of the negotiations, 
there were considerable differences between both sides but that 
they were striving for compromise.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by Jan Zizka </F>
in Warsaw; date not given: "We Want Not Assistance and Asymmetry 
but Partnership Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Political and economic development in Poland as 
well as regional cooperation in Central Europe and attitudes 
toward the West European integrative groupings were the topics 
discussed in an exclusive interview granted to our newspaper in 
Warsaw by Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak. 
  [Zizka] On the one hand, the Polish economy is showing signs 
of considerable recovery, while, on the other, many people are 
dissatisfied with their standard of living, and Solidarity is 
organizing strikes. In your opinion, could such actions 
destabilize the situation in Poland? 
  [Pawlak] It is important for the future to ensure that 
stability and development do not apply only to the economic 
sphere, which is just one element of the whole social system. 
The positive results of the reforms should be manifested in an 
overwhelming part of societal life. In its practical activity, 
our government would like to abide by the principle of 
intensifying the entire context of the reforms. We want to 
strive to overcome dissatisfaction, but, first and foremost, we 
want to take part in creating the conditions for the active 
involvement of a larger part of society in the transformation 
process. It is also apparent after a few years of implementing 
the reforms that they have to be carried out by evolutionary 
means--without shocks and without leaps and bounds. Considerable 
losses are incurred by hasty changes in both the economic and 
the social spheres. The third principle we would like to abide 
by is the rationalization of our activity and the better 
utilization of our potential. As far as the protests are 
concerned, they were organized in those economic branches in 
which real wages rose last year, although average real wages in 
Poland as a whole declined a little. The motive here is not so 
much economic as political. The locations of the protests are 
not congruent with the locations of problems and poverty. Those 
whom Solidarity is mobilizing in protests--miners and railroad 
workers--have, in short, above-average incomes. I think that, 
during the course of discussions and negotiations, we will 
succeed in improving the current atmosphere. However, the trade 
unionists must also understand that the government has to 
negotiate with all of the trade union organizations and is doing 
so. Solidarity withdrew from these talks. I think, however, 
that we will return to the negotiating table. 
  [Zizka] Problems are also cropping up in relations within 
the ruling coalition--between the Union of the Democratic Left 
(SLD) and the Polish People's Party (PSL). An example of this 
is the affair surrounding former Finance Minister Borowsky, who 
left the government. In your opinion, how will these relations 
unfold? 
  [Pawlak] I do not think these are coalition problems. This 
was the decision of Mr. Borowsky, who submitted his resignation. 
In every step like this, it is necessary to reckon with the 
possible consequences. There are no problems in the coalition, 
however. The best example is the approval of the state budget, 
for which the vast majority of deputies expressed their support. 
That is, I think it is an exaggeration to interpret the facts 
in this way. 
  [Zizka] This means that there is no threat to the coalition? 
  [Pawlak] The example of the budget proves that there are no 
disputes within the coalition in specific issues. 
  [Zizka] And what about ratifying the treaty with the 
Vatican--the concordat? 
  [Pawlak] We have not reached a coalition agreement on the 
concordat. This is not an issue that should provoke a coalition 
crisis. Within our PSL Club and in harmony with the freedom of 
belief and religious affiliation, we do not insist on a common 
point of view binding for all. 
  [Zizka] Another issue that causes disputes, mainly between 
the SLD and President Walesa, is the drafting of a new 
Constitution. Marshall of the Sejm Oleksy said that it will be 
necessary to seek a certain compromise. What is your opinion? 
  [Pawlak] If you want to familiarize yourself with the crux 
of the disputes, it would be better to turn to President Walesa, 
Marshall Oleksy, and SLD Chairman Kwasniewski. The government 
is not interested in examining the points at issue in this 
matter; we are interested in cooperation in resolving specific 
issues. 
  [Zizka] How would the PSL react to the candidacy of Mr. 
Kwasniewski for the post of president? 
  [Pawlak] If Mr. Kwasniewski becomes a candidate for the 
presidency, we will hold talks and discuss it. 
  [Zizka] The government coalition was criticized for its 
personnel policy in individual regions, where it tried to make 
numerous changes in posts in a number of provinces. 
  [Pawlak] When Bill Clinton became President of the United 
States, there was a thorough and rapid change of personnel 
throughout the administration. No one took exception to this. 
In Poland, there was definitely a quite considerable 
reevaluation throughout the political system. I am convinced, 
however, that this process has been completed and that no more 
significant changes should be made in the personnel sphere. 
  [Zizka] A protectionist policy, first and foremost in the 
agricultural sphere, was expected from the PSL before the 
elections. From this point of view, what is the situation now? 
  [Pawlak] It is impossible, of course, to claim that the 
PSL's activity is associated exclusively with protectionism. On 
the other hand, however, it is necessary to realize that this is 
normal in the activities of much richer and more developed 
countries, that they are seeking an international position for 
their own economy, and that they are looking after their own 
interests. Poland is also bound to look after its overall 
interests in economic cooperation with other countries. This 
also proceeds from the fact that the balance of trade worsened 
considerably last year and that Poland had a trade deficit of 
more than $2 billion. Most of this was due to trade with 
Western countries. For this reason, at a meeting in Prague at 
the beginning of this year, our side proposed a Partnership for 
Development. The maxim is not to talk about assistance and 
asymmetry but, rather, about partnership cooperation that is 
advantageous for everyone. This involves a partnership where it 
is irrelevant how great the differences are in economic 
potential. I think that this idea could be appropriate, first 
and foremost, for developing cooperation in our region. We 
should try to develop the institutions that simplify economic 
cooperation and the financial and transportation 
infrastructures. However, the opportunities for immediate 
contacts are also important, beginning with a meeting at the 
highest level, followed by meetings between businessmen and 
ending up with contacts among a large number of people--for 
instance, within the framework of tourism. We are interested in 
laying the real foundations of cooperation, not, however, by 
means of a bureaucracy. We favor the "G-4" formula and not one 
associated with the establishment of numerous institutions whose 
activity does not always bear practical fruit. We agreed on 
this at the meeting in Prague. The countries of Central Europe 
and the Baltic region should be open to each other, which is 
also important for creating joint enterprises and 
infrastructures. 
  [Zizka] Talks are also under way on agricultural products 
within the framework of the negotiations on the Central European 
Free Trade Zone (CEFTA). What will Poland's position be? 
  [Pawlak] Agricultural products are a major problem. This is 
the point of view of not only Poland but also all of the 
countries. Agriculture was the most complicated issue in the 
GATT talks. Agricultural products are also regarded as 
sensitive in our contacts with the European Union [EU]. This 
ensues from the specific nature of these products. Negotiations 
within this category will also not be simple. I think, however, 
that our countries are linked to such an extent by their common 
geographical location and by the problems associated with the 
changes and transformations that we are obliged to try to 
improve our common potential. We have to seek a solution on the 
markets of third countries in areas where we want to defend our 
potential, our jobs. I think this is possible. Our potential 
should be utilized not only in mutual cooperation within the 
region, but also in relation to third countries. 
  [Zizka] In connection with what you said about the state of 
Poland's exports, officials from the Polish National Bank 
maintain that foreign currency reserves are increasing alongside 
their decline. According to them, this means that exports are 
higher than it seems from the statistics; however, a 
considerable proportion of them are unregistered and take place 
without the knowledge of the banks. 
  [Pawlak] I do not think we should be proud of this. 
  [Zizka] A number of Czech politicians do not want to talk 
about "cooperation within the Visegrad Group." They would 
prefer the expression "CEFTA states." What do you think about 
this? 
  [Pawlak] I agree with this view. It is all very well to 
come up with great ideas, but there comes a difficult point at 
which it is necessary to put them into practice. The Visegrad 
Group was based, first and foremost, on the idea of political 
cooperation. CEFTA is an expression of very specific economic 
cooperation--the liberalization of mutual trade. This course of 
action is very practical, especially today, when it is necessary 
to turn political ideas into specific acts. This involves 
ensuring that our economies become a dynamic element of the 
pan-European system. 
  [Zizka] In Prague, at the beginning of this year, you 
discussed mainly economic issues, while President Walesa dealt 
more with political and security issues. What is Poland's 
priority here? For example, entry into the European Union or 
admission into NATO? 
  [Pawlak] First of all, it is essential that there is 
interest on both sides, which is not always the case. I think 
that our experiences with NATO illustrate this well. It is the 
same with the European Union. Discussions on whether we should 
apply for membership now are, in my opinion, premature. To 
responsibly proclaim such an intention, certain parameters have 
to be complied with economically. It seems to me that we should 
not bargain in the sphere of political ideas but cooperate in 
such a way that our countries do not lag behind in mutual 
relations--for instance, compared with bilateral contacts with 
the European Union. On the contrary, there is nothing preventing 
more dynamic cooperation in our region. Incidentally, this 
would facilitate our entry into the European Union. At the 
moment, this is a rather distant prospect, and the whole process 
requires a certain amount of time. It is illogical to make an 
idealistic announcement about an idea that cannot be put into 
action for a long time. 
  [Zizka] Foreign Minister Olechowski, however, said in 
Brussels that Poland will apply to join the European Union in 
the near future. It is known that the head of the diplomatic 
corps was nominated to the government by the president. To what 
extent, therefore, is he the representative of the president, 
and to what extent is he the representative of the government? 
  [Pawlak] I discussed this with Mr. Olechowski, who said that 
he had spoken in Brussels about the prospects for such a 
request. He definitely did not speak about it as a fait 
accompli. This is a subject for discussion in Poland. We will 
give it consideration in the government and parliament. The 
process of incorporation into the EU's structures depends not on 
proclaimed declarations but on the overall state of the economy. 
It is necessary to stick to reality. 
  [Zizka] Is a situation in which not only representatives of 
the coalition but also of the president sit in the government 
compatible with effective work by the government? 
  [Pawlak] In Poland we have so many problems and so much work 
that there are a great many areas toward which we should be 
directing our energy. It is worse if someone deals with 
something else. So far, however, such problems have not cropped 
up in the government. Plurality is always better than a 
unilateral orientation. There are often more ideas in a 
pluralist system. Perhaps it is also more complicated to come to 
conclusions. In short, we have more ideas and objectives to 
think about and choose from. If we concentrate on our work, 
there is no time for other issues.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kazimierz Dziewanowski under the "Always on </F>
Saturday" rubric: "A Few Useful Lessons"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Pawlak's unexpected trip to Moscow 
caused quite a lot of confusion. So I would like to make a few 
remarks on the topic of that visit; these remarks will deal with 
some very important issues. 
  Remark Number One: Contrary to some other 
journalists, it is not my view that the customs duties declared 
by the Russians (immediately after the visit) on many goods 
exported by Poland were intended to be a deliberate affront to 
the prime minister. These customs duties had been announced 
before, so the concurrence of the two events is merely a 
coincidence. But, as people surrounding the prime minister 
argued, if an improvement of the situation of Polish trade with 
the East was the main purpose of the visit, one must say that 
the situation is worse than it was before; ergo, the visit's 
main goal was not achieved. 
  Remark Number Two: That disadvantageous effect 
was caused by a few serious things. First is the false view, 
which is shared by a few of the prime minister's advisers, 
several members of the government, and some Sejm deputies, that 
Poland's problems in its trade with the East are due to mistakes 
in policies committed by previous governments. That view is 
proof of ignorance of the real situation by those who espouse it 
and of their certain political pigheadedness, which it never 
pays to go by. It is enough to familiarize oneself with the 
problems faced by Finland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, 
France, and many other countries in their trade with Russia to 
be able to assess how true that argument really is. Our trade 
with Russia suffers from problems primarily due to Russia's 
economic collapse and the inability of the Russian financial 
system to service commercial activities. So one must look for 
ways to improve trade settlements between our two countries, but 
the visit did not result in any progress in this field. 
  Remark Number Three: The trip was poorly 
prepared. It is a trivial thing to say that the prime minister 
of a country should not go on a trip to a country as important 
as Russia, whose relations with us have recently become quite 
difficult, if the signing of some minor protocols is to be the 
visit's only result. The point is that, if a trip is not well 
prepared or thought through, then, as a net result, it creates 
the impression of deterioration (which may not be justified) 
instead of bringing about an improvement. 
  Remark Number Four: Every country in the world 
tries to avoid conveying the impression that its authorities are 
conducting several foreign policies that are independent and 
uncoordinated with one another. But that is exactly the kind of 
impression one is bound to have when the president learns from a 
television report about an important foreign trip by the prime 
minister. The point is neither in stressing pragmatic rules of 
bureaucracy and official behavior nor rules of courtesy that, 
after all, are indispensable and worth observing. The real 
point is that, when you have an official guest visiting a grand 
capital and the hosts can see that the guest failed to come to 
an agreement over the visit with other forces in his country, 
his position is weak and his credibility shaky. If elements of 
domestic infighting among different political parties become 
visible on the international level, it is the country itself 
that is harmed the most, but participants in these games are not 
strengthening their positions, either. On the contrary, they 
lose prestige, both domestically and internationally. Such are 
the iron and permanent principles in the arena of international 
politics, which are observed by all experienced players. One 
must say with sorrow here that the rules have been violated by 
Poland a few times in the past. The results of that are always 
disastrous. 
  One Final Remark: Russian customs duties show 
that customs duties are a double-edged sword. Those in Poland 
who persistently speak in favor of protective customs duties 
ought to keep in mind that we are not living in a vacuum. It is 
no accident that the most reasonable politicians and economists 
around the world are in favor of the gradual elimination of 
customs barriers, or that the GATT agreement was signed, or that 
wars over customs duties and trade issues are regarded as 
considerably harmful. Poland, in turn, is a country that should 
be very eager to develop its exports. 
  So we received several useful lessons this past week. Now 
the point is for us to get them into our heads, and fast.

  [Text] Warsaw, 18 Mar--Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski 
said at a press conference after Friday's meeting with Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak that a team of Solidarity and 
government specialists will begin work on 22 March. 
Confirmation of this decision by the prime minister is a 
precondition for Solidarity suspending the strike. 
  By the end of next week, the team will prepare "legal 
methods 
and a decisionmaking process" to facilitate the implementation 
of Solidarity's demands. These proposals will then be discussed 
at the next government meeting, which will make political 
decisions, Krzaklewski explained. He added that this team 
should identifiey those decisions that can be implemented later 
and controlled by a tripartite commission. 
  Solidarity expects that the prime minister will confirm 
these 
decisions during a press conference on Friday. The decision to 
continue the strike also depends on a meeting with regional 
Solidarity leaders and chairmen of branch secretariats. 
Krzaklewski said that this decision will most probably be made 
tonight, when, after the prime minister's press conference, the 
staff of the National Strike Action Headquarters is to meet.

Council of Ministers is to debate the results of the team's work 
at its next session, [Solidarity Chairman] Marian Krzaklewski 
told journalists after his meeting with Prime Minister Pawlak. 
Chiefs of the trade union's regions and branches are keeping 
their distance vis-a-vis the results of the talks with the prime 
minister. They have no intention of ending their protests until 
such time as the agreements concluded are actually implemented. 
But they did announce that there will be no "massive strike 
actions" for the time being. 
  The prime minister also met with chiefs of the All-Polish 
Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ], Solidarity '80, and the Polish 
Miners Trade Unions yesterday. 
<H5>  Prime Minister Opposed to Grumbling </H5>
  While responding to questions from journalists, the prime 
minister reported that talks among the experts will not be in 
the form of bilateral negotiations but will be held as 
"procedural talks." He also said that the principle of 
"regarding issues concerning all employees, the government 
negotiates in a multiparty arrangement--that is, one 
representing all groups and unions" is in effect. When it comes 
to bilateral talks, they are only possible when "there are 
disputes concerning issues that are significant from the 
standpoints of different parties," and the only goal of such 
talks is to find a formula of how to solve such disputes within 
the Trilateral Commission (government-employers-trade unions) or 
within joint negotiating teams (trade unions, employers, 
government, and territorial self-governments). 
  Pawlak said that experts for the government and Solidarity 
are to work out a "mechanism for a referral of those issues to 
the Trilateral Commission and to the teams, with the goal of 
discussions involving many parties." 
  "No problems have been solved as yet simply by grumbling or 
shouting how difficult life is in Poland," Pawlak said. 
  It was provided in a joint communique signed by the trade 
union's spokesman and the director of the Government's Press 
Office that the results of talks with the chairmen of Solidarity 
and other trade unions--and also the results of the experts' 
work--will be presented to the Council of Ministers for debate. 
<H5>  Solidarity Keeping Its Distance </H5>
  Krzaklewski and the prime minister did not talk to 
journalists together. The chairman of Solidarity left the 
Office of the Council of Ministers by a back door and came 
across OPZZ Chairwoman Ewa Spychalska on the way. Rumor has it 
that he kissed her on the hand and wished her success in her 
talks with the prime minister. 
  Krzaklewski organized a conference for journalists on 
"'Solidarity's territory." He reported there that he had agreed 
with Pawlak that a team of governmental and Solidarity experts 
will be set up this coming Tuesday [22 March]. The team is 
supposed to come up with suggestions for legal changes that 
would be required to implement the demands of Solidarity by the 
end of the week. Subsequently, the Council of Ministers would 
approve the team's conclusions at its next session. 
  "Until that time, the trade union will maintain its state of 
readiness," the chairman of Solidarity said. According to 
Krzaklewski, the Trilateral Commission is supposed to see to it 
that the agreement is observed in practice. 
  But the reception of the decisions by chiefs of regions and 
branches of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union 
Solidarity, who were awaiting the results of the talks with the 
prime minister, was cool. 
  "Pawlak is reported to have said that the demands of 
Solidarity are justified. We were surprised by that statement, 
especially because leaders for the Democratic Left Alliance have 
been saying something quite the opposite," a member of the 
National Commission [of Solidarity] told RZECZPOSPOLITA. 
  Piotr Zak, the National Commission's press spokesman, told 
us 
that, until such time as the experts's decisions are 
implemented, Solidarity will continue its protests, in 
accordance with a time schedule that was agreed upon earlier. 
But, for the time being, there will be no "massive strike 
actions," as had been announced earlier. 
  Zak refused to comment on a statement by the prime minister 
that the talks with Solidarity are of a procedural nature. 
  --The prime minister agreed with Spychalska that he will set 
up either a plenipotentiary or a coordinator for the government 
for the purpose of "making interministry issues more specific." 
According to the OPZZ chairwoman, lack of agreement among 
ministries is an impediment to negotiating social guarantees. 
  --The prime minister agreed with [chief of Solidarity '80] 
Marian Jurczyk that experts for the trade union and the 
government will hold a session. [Chief of the Miners Trade 
Unions] Kisielinski was critical of the strikes by Solidarity. 
The government is to make efforts to include Solidarity '80 and 
the Miners Trade Union. [sentence as published] Solidarity '80 
is to represent Poland at the International Labor Organization 
this year. 
<H5>  Strikes by Solidarity </H5>
  Yesterday, plants in the Ziemia Sandomierska Region were on 
strike, among them the Stalowa Wola steelworks and a sulfur mine 
in Tarnobrzeg. Also, five plants in the Jelenia Gora Region 
were on strike and some in the Elblag Region. Employees of the 
Radoskor plant in Radom are still on strike.

<F P=106> [Article by Z.L.: "Our Defender Is Under Treatment"] </F>
  [Text] On the eve of the Army's springtime 
conscription, the military is raising the alarm: If this time 
around the same kinds of poorly prepared recruits find their way 
into the barracks, as was the case this past fall, training 
programs in many military units will be disorganized from the 
very beginning. 
  According to data from the General Staff, every year only 
half of all young men who are legally obliged to perform their 
"citizen's duty to the motherland" actually serve in the Army. 
Because the number of recruits using various kinds of 
deferments is so huge, when it comes to the remaining 
candidates, the choice is severely limited. "The Army gets 
those who were not successful in fleeing"--that is the malicious 
way in which those who know a lot about yearly conscriptions 
describe the phenomenon. Even if such views are exaggerated, 
statistics regarding service waivers for potential conscripts 
are a very serious problem for commanders of military units. In 
some subdivisions, during the first weeks and months of 
service--that is, within the so-called short way--as many as 15 
to 20 percent of soldiers drop out for, among other reasons, 
ailments that have just been diagnosed. It is practically 
impossible to make up for losses in incomplete crews of combat 
vehicles, while legal provisions do not provide for the 
possibility of conducting a follow-up conscription. 
  The civil rights spokesman has already several times 
described the situation of an insufficient number of soldiers 
having to perform tasks designated for full subdivisions--which, 
by definition, means that the soldiers have a much greater 
burden to bear--as violating the principles of equality, which 
also means a violation of civil rights. 
  According to officers responsible for the recruitment and 
adaptation of young soldiers, many conscripts conceal their 
ailments on purpose--at the point of recruitment, as well as for 
the first few days--to be able to avail themselves of the right 
to full medical treatment at the state's expense after a medical 
board issues a judgment saying the ailment could have been 
acquired during service. "A citizen aware of his rights simply 
uses them"--this is the way officers comment on that phenomenon 
and also on conscripts leaving service after the first several 
days not only with a medical waiver, which practically puts 
their future use to the Army into question, but also being 
financially supported. That is because every soldier, 
regardless of whether he has served a day or a year in the Army, 
is currently entitled to an allowance of approximately 4 million 
zlotys, on average. 
  According to medical services, there is nothing strange in 
all kinds of human deficiencies and ailments coming to surface 
in the initial period of military service. Often, it is the 
first time in years that young men are subjected to such intense 
physical training, which helps surface all problems associated 
with the spine, flat feet, or concealed deficiencies of the 
circulation system. High stress levels and a sudden change in 
life-styles are also often the basis for a so-called 
disadaptation syndrome, which manifests itself in an inability 
to adapt oneself to the extreme conditions under which military 
service takes place. But we are not an exception in that 
regard: Psychologists for almost all armies have been observing 
the same syndrome.

  [Text] Geneva, March 18 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Deputy Prime 
Minister Zeljko Simic on Friday assessed as successful a 
Yugoslav delegation's three-day working visit to Geneva, where 
it had taken part in the work of the groups for succession to 
former Yugoslavia and on humanitarian issues within the 
framework of the international conference on former Yugoslavia. 
  In a statement made before leaving Geneva, Simic described 
as 
exceptionally important the acceptance of the Yugoslav 
delegation's suggestion as to how the assets of former 
Yugoslavia should be inventoried. 
  The working group's agreement [words indistinct] the 
Yugoslav 
suggestion on an equal footing, after almost two years of 
denying this, practically means that the legal and economic 
postulates of the former Yugoslav federation must be recognized, 
which in turn means that there can be no arbitrary 
interpretation of the entitlement to state property, explained 
Simic. 
  The insistence of the other former Yugoslav republics that a 
division of assets was made unde the 1974 constitution collapsed 
when a debate on a partial division of assets was taken off the 
agenda, he added. 
  He further said he had held an important discussion on the 
crisis in former Yugoslavia with the deputy co-chairman of the 
former Yugoslavia conference, Ambassador Geerd Ahrens. 
  Simic said the Yugoslav delegation was satisfied with the 
session of the working group on humanitarian issues, which for 
the first time publicly voiced the view that international 
sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) had done 
incalculable harm and had unjustly punished the most vulnerable 
section of the population -- the elderly, the children, the ill 
and the refugees -- thus [word indistinct] the efforts of 
humanitarian organisations. 
  U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata has also 
voiced this view, so that it might be expected without a doubt 
to produce some political effect, said Simic. 
  Yugoslavia has fulfilled all the conditions as set down by 
the international community, and now expects the European Union 
to show in deed what it undertook late last year to do in word, 
namely to take the necessary steps to ease or lift the economic 
sanctions which have been proven so utterly inappropriate, said 
Simic. 
  The views voiced at Geneva indicate that the international 
community is becoming more amenable to arguments Yugoslavia has 
been presenting since before the outbreak of the crisis, said 
Simic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic by </F>
Spomenka Jovic in Belgrade on 18 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Jovic] Can I freely assume that there is 
significant optimism and faith in a more stable government? 
  [Marjanovic] Well, you see, the stability of the government 
will depend on what we manage to achieve. Times are tough, and 
had we not believed that we could achieve something, I believe 
that neither I nor my associates would not have undertaken this 
task. What is the essence? The essence is that the only strong 
elements we had as pointers that we had to apply ourselves to 
diligently in order to fully succeed lay in our belief that, 
even in conditions of sanctions, there was a possibility of 
mobilizing the mechanisms for reviving the economy. If there 
were no sanctions, this would be a completely different thing, 
and I believe that we would be able to come up with even better 
programs. However, I am convinced that we will find the 
strength to keep the dinar stable, to improve and increase 
production, at least to the extent that will keep the dinar 
stable for the time being. Once we gain a little strength, then 
we can think more seriously about the further revival of the 
economy. 
  [Jovic] I thank you for this interview, and wish you 
successful cooperation with your team and the best of luck in 
your work.

  [Text] A total of 128 deputies supported the government by 
a show of hands, 77 were against, while 30 deputies refrained 
from voting. At the end of the marathon debate, just before the 
vote was taken, Prime Minister-designate Mirko Marjanovic 
addressed the assembly. 
  [Begin Marjanovic recording] This long debate has 
strengthened my conviction and my resolve to adhere to the main 
course of the program and the stable dinar. We do not see an 
alternative to this program, because by establishing monetary 
sovereignty and macroeconomic stabilization, it paves the way 
toward a modern market economy which is the only thing that will 
lead to a lasting increase of the national revenue, employment, 
and the citizens' living standard. We are aware of all the 
difficulties. Do not expect us to conduct a policy which would 
take us back into hyperinflation or into an administrative 
economy and society. We believe that this year, the policy of a 
stable dinar will motivate and economically compel a great 
number of companies to be more successful despite the sanctions. 
It is a good omen that the business community itself is now 
displaying more optimism and is announcing an increase in 
orders, production, greater use of equipment, and an increase in 
export. We anticipate that all this, accompanied by a 
successful agricultural year, will give us the chance to see -- 
after a hiatus of several years -- a rise in the national 
revenue, in stable, therefore, not inflatory conditions. As far 
as our resolve to insist on a stable dinar is concerned, this 
government will do its part of the job and will cooperate 
closely with the Federal Government, the Montenegrin Government, 
and, of course, with the Yugoslav National Bank regarding all 
issues that fall within their respective domains. The 
government will treat every failure connected to the program as 
its personal failure. We shall organize ourselves in such a way 
that we will be able to follow the implementation of the program 
on a daily basis and make the necessary adjustments. We shall 
regularly inform you of this. We accept all criticism and 
suggestions that can help the implementation of the program. 
[end recording] 
  In addition to the prime minister, the new republican 
government comprises five deputy prime ministers, 20 ministers, 
and another four ministers without portfolio.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 18 (TANJUG) -- Serbia's new Prime 
Minister Mirko Marjanovic said late on Friday that he and his 
associates had come to grips with problems in the belief that 
the mechanisms of economic recovery might be set in motion even 
under sanctins. 
  The parliament of Yugoslavia's Republic of Serbia on 
Thursday 
endorsed a new cabinet, headed by Marjanovic. The cabinet 
includes five vice-premiers, 20 departmental ministers and four 
ministers without portfolio. 
  Marjanovic said in Serbian television's prime-time news 
programme that the new government would act immediately and felt 
confident that they would manage to maintain the national 
currency, the dinar, stable and boost production. 
  This is only the beginning, and any substantial economic 
recovery should be left for later, he added. 
  Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) has lost 25 million dollars 
through U.N. sanctions clamped two years ago for the country's 
alleged involvement in Bosnia's civil war. 
  The figure would be much higher if the total cost had been 
calculated of manitaining the 600,000 refugees from the 
war-zones registered in Yugoslavia, 95 percent of whom have been 
accommodated with private families.

  [Text] [Announcer] President of the Republic of Kosova 
Dr. Ibrahim Rugova held a news conference today. Ramadan 
Mucolli reports from Prishtina: 
  [Mucolli] At the beginning of the conference, President of 
the Republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim Rugova acquainted the 
reporters with the Serbian police repression against the 
Albanian people of Kosova. During the last week, this repression 
was manifested in the form of raids, harassments, arrests, 
interventions into educational institutions, etc. In this 
framework, he defined as a drastic case the siege to Seraj 
village in the Leposaviq commune and the raids on 22 homes in 
this village. Rugova assessed that repressive measures in the 
northernmost villages in Kosova are carried out with the 
intention of obliging Albanians to leave their territories. 
  President Rugova also commented on the sending of summons 
for 
recruiting the Albanian youngsters to the Serbian Army and added 
that we should express gratitude to those who refused to 
participate in the wars waged in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia, 
because in this way, they have made a contribution to stopping 
the war. 
  Mr. Rugova also stressed that many Serbian civilians have 
recently been involved in brutal interventions against the 
Albanian institutions and the harassment of Albanians. Rugova 
also warned these civilians, if they are from Kosova, not to 
play with fire and causing greater enmity between Albanians and 
Serbs. 
  In the course of the sequestration of the buildings of 
various Albanian cultural, educational, and scientific 
institutions in Kosova, President Rugova mentioned the 
sequestration of the building of the High Pedagogical School of 
Gjakove. As a testimony to the Serbian attempts to recolonize 
Kosova, Rugova underlined the warning against starting to 
construct buildings for refugees or laying aside land for 
newcomers, as well as against threats of proceedings against 
Albanian refugees who may return to Kosova. 
  President Rugova then assessed highly the rallies of 
Albanians in Germany, England, and Norway as successful efforts 
for the internationalization of the question of Kosova and their 
political will. On this occasion, he thanked all the persons 
and institutions of those countries that joined the rallies and 
supported the demands of Albanians. 
  Mr. Rugova particularly hailed the debate on Kosova in the 
Belgian Parliament, especially the statement of Foreign Minister 
Willy Claes that the status of 1974 for Kosova is surpassed [as 
heard]. 
  Answering a question on the signing of the agreement between 
the Muslims and Croats and an eventual similar model in the case 
of the Albanians of Kosova, President Rugova stressed that I 
hail the Muslim-Croat agreement and consider it to be a first 
step in stopping the war in Bosnia. 
  Further on, he stressed that ideas for federations and 
confederations have existed before in the Balkans but, as 
testified in the case of former Yugoslavia, they have been 
unsuccessful. We are not against integrations on the basis of 
new principles, but first of all, every people should be 
independent and should then decide on relations with others. 
  President Rugova also answered other questions by reporters.

<F P=106> [Report by M. Antic: "Rugova Fights Back"] </F>
  [Text] Pristina -- Recently, both the ethnic Albanian 
press and some circles of the ethnic Albanian political 
alternative in Kosovo have issued many controversial reports and 
commentaries that openly call in question the results and 
effects of the political and diplomatic efforts made so far by 
Ibrahim Rugova, leader of the ethnic Albanian separatist 
movement for the republic of Kosovo (or rather by his propaganda 
team). Of course, most of those reports and commentaries were 
published in the Serbian press as well. Yesterday the Kosovo 
Information Center issued a commentary in an unusual way, 
sending to Rugova's critics the message that they are on the 
wrong track because the international positions of Kosovo and of 
Rugova have definitely been improving. The Kosovo Information 
Center, whose commentary was published by BULJKU yesterday, 
alleges that the Belgrade regime accuses Rugova of pursuing a 
radical policy and extremism, aimed at the strengthening of his 
personal position abroad, while by such attacks, Rugova's 
critics from the ethnic Albanian political circles want to 
weaken his position at home and abroad, which he earned through 
his endeavors to settle the ethnic Albanian national question. 
  The commentary, addressing in the first place the ethnic 
Albanian critics of Rugova and the results of his policies, 
reminds those same critics that they are focusing on the wrong 
problems, because, instead of concentrating on the Serbian 
terror and oppression on ethnic Albanians, which threatens to 
result in the arrest of Rugova himself, they are accusing Rugova 
that his policy is futile, and his resistance too passive. 
"Those same critics," the commentary runs further, "do not 
forbear to scandalously dramatize and extensively report on some 
cases of misunderstanding among several ethnic Albanian 
political groups in Kosovo and Macedonia, while hardly paying 
attention to the arrest of the entire staff of the Defense 
Ministry of the so-called republic of Kosovo. Some ethnic 
Albanian media and certain individuals have openly expressed 
their satisfaction at disagreements between Pristina and Tirana." 
  Since the entire commentary suggests that there are serious 
breaches on the ethnic Albanian political stage in Kosovo, it 
sends the message to the "heretics" to come to their senses and 
concentrate on the Serbian occupation of Kosovo, rather than on 
Rugova, who works for the ethnic Albanian national cause in the 
best possible way. After this message the commentary specifies 
the political efforts that Rugova has made this year, as well as 
the effects and tributes paid to his policy abroad. Among other 
things the commentary also says that after Rugova's tour in the 
European Union member-countries late last year, Kosovo and 
Rugova's peaceful policy have been continuously winning 
recognition and support also this year as well. Then the 
commentary recalls Rugova's January visit to the United States, 
where President Clinton and State Secretary Warren Christopher 
expressed full support to Rugova, promising also that the United 
States will not tolerate the aggressive Serbian policy on 
Kosovo. The next example is Rugova's February visit to the 
United States, where Clinton and Al Gore expressed their 
understanding for Rugova's peaceful policy, which aims at 
finding a peaceful settlement to the situation in Kosovo. 
  The commentary further says that last week the question of 
Kosovo was discussed by many international institutions, for 
instance, at the meeting of the highest CSCE officials in 
Prague, where the resolution was adopted by which it is demanded 
that the CSCE mission be returned to Kosovo. The commentary 
also points out the resolution adopted by the UN Commission for 
Human Rights, which refers only to Kosovo, and also the 
resolution on former Yugoslavia, which anticipates the 
self-determination of Kosovo. It is also emphasized that the 
Kosovo issue was discussed at the latest meeting of the EU 
Council of Ministers, as well as at many other international 
forums, where some concrete solutions for Kosovo have been 
proposed.

  [Text] There are internal debates within the Democratic 
Community of Hungarians in Vojvodina [VMDK]. The reporter is 
Szilveszter Varga. 
  [Varga] One week before the VMDK conference for the 
reelection of officials, there is a danger of a rift in the 
organization. This is what the two deputy chairmen, Janos Vekas 
and Sandor Hodi, have told the Novi Sad paper MAGYAR SZO. 
  According to Vekas, although the internal differences do 
exist, none of the trends that have emerged within the VMDK have 
turned against the autonomy demand itself. For this reason, 
according to Vekas, there is a chance that the dominant idea 
relating to the justification for the autonomy concept will hold 
the VMDK together. 
  Sandor Hodi is also saying that even after the 27 March 
general meeting for the election of officials, the Hungarians in 
Vojvodina will be left to their own devices. In his opinion, 
here too the same question in essence will have to be decided as 
at the Hungarian elections in May -- whether the VMDK should 
keep to the right, the left, or straight ahead. According to 
Hodi, a left-wing faction has evolved within the VMDK leadership 
which is openly striving for the expropriation of power and for 
a showdown with those who think in a different way. 
  However, an even bigger problem is posed by the fact that 
[VMDK Chairman] Andras Agoston, at the head of this group, 
considers that the time has come for an understanding, or even 
an appeasement, with the powers that be, which could endanger 
the autonomy endeavors of the Hungarians of Vojvodina, Sandor 
Hodi asserts in the Novi Sad paper MAGYAR SZO.

<F P=106> [CTK report: "Joining NATO Is a Necessity for the Czech </F>
Republic"] 
  [Text] Stara Boleslav [Central Bohemia]--According to 
Vladimir Suman (Civic Democratic Alliance), chairman of the 
parliamentary Defense and Security Committee, the Czech Republic 
cannot withstand the most outstanding security risks on its own. 
  The risks are the uncertain development in the former USSR, 
aggressive nationalism and its demonstrations, and the advance 
of organized crime, the chairman said. According to Suman, the 
war in former Yugoslavia may serve as an example that border 
changes cannot be achieved by force. Yesterday, at a meeting 
between the Committee deputies and the command officers of the 
4th Air Defense Division, Suman described joining NATO as a 
necessity for the Czech Republic because, according to him, it 
is the only way to withstand these risks. He considers 
"playing" with other possibilities to be irresponsible toward 
the citizens.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by station editor </F>
Robert Tamchyna; place and date not given: "Conversations at 
Lany"--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Tamchyna] Mr. President, in the last edition of 
these conversations, you spoke in great detail about the current 
political situation in Slovakia. This week was marked there by 
the appointment of the new government and the parliament's 
approval of the date of the early elections this fall. Could it 
be said that the political crisis has been successfully resolved? 
  [Havel] I do not think the latest developments mark the end 
of the crisis in Slovakia and the beginning of an era of 
stability. For numerous and varied reasons, real stability of 
the Slovak political scene and the creation of a political 
culture necessary for the peaceful development of the country 
are still some distance away. 
  Nevertheless, it is undoubtedly an important and good move; 
it is a move in the right direction. I would not say it is a 
victory of some over others. I would say it is a victory for 
the parliament concept, a victory for democracy. [passage 
omitted] The whole process was free of chaos, uncertainty, 
lawlessness, and so on. 
  As far as the government is concerned, I do not wish to 
provide any assessments or comments on it. I believe it will be 
a hard-working and nonconfrontational government. 
  It might be relevant to comment briefly on the new Slovak 
prime minister, Mr. Moravcik, whom I know quite well because, at 
the time I was federal president, he was federal minister of 
foreign affairs. Thus, I had quite a lot to do with him. We 
went to the CSCE summit in Helsinki together. I must say that 
my cooperation with him was exceptionally good. He is an 
accommodating and very decent person, who does not miss an 
opportunity to either express thanks for a job well done or 
praise it. At the same time, he is a person who expresses 
himself openly and yet politely if his views differ from those 
of others. I liked cooperating with him. 
  I think he is a decent man. I believe that a climate of 
democracy and a spirit of dialogue and cooperation will prevail 
in the government because these will indeed be necessary. After 
all, it is the government where, on the one hand, there is the 
Party of the Democratic Left and, on the other, there is the 
Christian Democratic Movement. This means that both poles of 
the political spectrum are present there. Without a real will 
for compromise, for search for compromise, for cooperation and 
dialogue, the government could find its work difficult. Let us 
hope it will succeed, and, above all, let us hope the result of 
the next elections is good and that this leads to a calmer 
period in Slovakia's political life. 
  [Tamchyna] I have no idea whether you encountered anything 
of 
this kind in your circles, but, speaking for myself, it felt as 
if some reactions to the current events in Slovakia emanated an 
unconcealed joy that this political crisis no longer affects us 
and that the Slovaks should deal with this in their own way. Is 
this not a little dangerous? 
  [Havel] This is a phenomenon I have frequently criticized, a 
phenomenon I do not like and one that I tend to brand Czech 
provincialism. [passage omitted] 
  This policy is completely shortsighted, and the social 
climate or social mentality promoting this policy is no good, 
either. We have paid a high price for it in our modern history. 
This could be documented by many examples. I think that, just 
as we should not be indifferent to what is taking place in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, we should not be indifferent to what is 
happening in other neighboring countries or in more distant 
countries. We should all the more not be indifferent to what is 
going on in Slovakia because Slovakia is our immediate neighbor. 
Together with Slovakia, we have had many good and bad 
experiences. There are thousands of threads binding us together 
with this neighbor. Although we are two independent states now, 
neither state should interfere in political developments of the 
other state or influence its history. We must follow each 
other's actions very attentively and support everything that 
will facilitate good mutual cooperation. [passage omitted] 
  [Tamchyna] Mr. President, you have mentioned several times 
in 
conversation, even here at Lany, the necessity of compensating 
our citizens for injustices perpetrated against them during 
World War II. The Czech Government has now stipulated 
conditions for the so-called humanitarian gesture toward victims 
of Nazism. Are you not concerned that this humanitarian 
gesture, based on the amount to be divided among an exact number 
of victims, could provoke ill will or an inappropriate reaction? 
  [Havel] I think--and it was repeated often enough--that 
injustices cannot be undone. There are injustices that simply 
cannot be undone. No one could ever be compensated for spending 
10 years in a Nazi concentration camp or in a communist prison, 
or for not being able to work in his profession for a whole 
lifetime, even if he were given a million korunas. What we are 
trying to do, with varied degree of success, is to mitigate 
these injustices, to demonstrate that we are aware of injustices 
having been perpetrated. Naturally, it is important that this 
gesture of providing 1 billion korunas should also express our 
knowledge of the suffering our compatriots had to endure during 
World War II; it should show that we are not indifferent to it. 
We want somehow to demonstrate our awareness of it without any 
hint of suggestion that this amount would in some way remove the 
suffering endured. 
  I think it is very good, and it is not important what you 
call this. It is very important to realize that this gesture of 
our government does not mean giving up negotiations with Germany 
about what used to be called compensation, which was paid to 
many other countries in the form of restitution but which did 
not happen in our case for various reasons beyond our control. 
  However, we think that this compensation, which the German 
Government also called a humanitarian gesture for its own legal 
reasons, is due us, and we are not giving up. These 
negotiations will continue, and I consider it my own personal 
duty. I have been engaged in numerous talks on this issue. 
[passage omitted] 
  I do not consider the matter closed. On the contrary, I 
firmly believe that we will succeed in getting this settlement 
with Germany. It will undoubtedly contribute toward cleansing 
our relations with this big and important neighbor.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mirjana Bunjevac-Filipovic from the </F>
White House in Washington] 
  [Text] The agreements signed today are of exceptional 
importance for both Croats and Muslims and also for peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the stability of the whole of Europe. 
The guarantees obtained here in Washington should help all this 
to be implemented effectively and as soon as possible. 
  Two of the six agreements signed are, so to speak, of a 
general nature. One of those two agreements obligates the 
signatories to support the formation of the federation between 
Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the other to 
support the development of economic and military cooperation 
between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation and the Republic of 
Croatia. There are also four separate documents: the 
preliminary agreement on the confederal relations between the 
Republic of Croatia and the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
the agreement granting the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation access 
to the sea via the territory of the Republic of Croatia, the 
agreement granting the Republic of Croatia free passage through 
the territory of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, and finally, 
the agreement on the constitution of Bosnia- Herzegovina, which 
will be sent to the Constitutional Assembly for discussion and 
adoption. 
  After the signing ceremony, President Clinton had separate 
talks first with President Izetbegovic, and then with President 
Tudjman. 
  The Republic of Croatia and the whole of the Croatian nation 
highly appreciate the role of the United States and President 
Clinton in reaching the agreement on creating the Croat-Bosniak 
Federation and the confederation between the future 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation and the Republic of Croatia. 
  This is said in a statement by President Tudjman following 
his talks with President Clinton. 
  These agreements will be important for halting the war in 
the 
former Yugoslavia and the creation of conditions for permanent 
peace and stability of the new world order in this part of 
Europe. The United States' leading role -- moral, political, and 
in the security sphere -- is of paramount interest for uniting 
efforts for preserving peace on the part of the most important 
world factors -- the United Nations, the CSCE, the European 
Union, NATO, and individual states. The role of the pope and 
the Vatican are of paramount importance in the ecumenical 
efforts to restore peace and encourage cooperation between the 
nations and religious communities in different crisis areas. 
This is also said in a statement issued after President 
Tudjman's talks with President Clinton. 
  President Tudjman also held talks with European Union 
Foreign 
Ministers Van der Broek, Claes, Kinkel, and Papoulias. A 
luncheon offered in honor of Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic, 
and the Croatian and Muslim delegation by U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher is under way.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 21 (AFP) -- Canadian UN forces have 
discovered heavy arms including tanks, anti-aircraft guns and 
mortars in a serious breach of the NATO-imposed exclusion zone 
around Sarajevo, a UN spokesman said Monday [21 March]. Calling 
it a "big violation", Major Simon MacDowell, spokesman for the 
UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), said the Canadians had found the 
arms late Sunday [20 March] in the area where six 120 mm 
howitzers had been found on March 4. He said: "They determined 
that there are a considerable number of weapons there more than 
the six." These included four tanks, three anti-aircraft guns, 
one 405 mm howitzer and 18 mortars. 
  Although the weapons were on the outer edge of the exclusion 
zone, near Cisluk 19 kilometres (11 miles) northwest of 
Sarajevo, they were very near the Sarajevo-Visoko road, which is 
supposed to be opened to civilian travel on Wednesday [23 
March]. "At the local level, Canadians and the Serb commanders 
are in contact," MacDowell said. "The local level has not 
achieved any results in getting the weapons moved out or put 
under UNPROFOR control." 
  The spokesman said the UN tried to arrange a high-level 
meeting between Bosnian Serb leader radivan Karadzic and top 
UNPROFOR officials at Serb headquarters in Pale later Monday to 
resolve the situation. "The Serbs cannot withdraw straight back 
out since they've backed up right to HVO (Croat) [Croatian 
Defense Council] lines," MacDowell said. "We don't know where 
the weapons came from. It's a big violation," he added, making 
clear however that "these guns are not capable of engaging 
Sarajevo. We have them now under observation." The spokesman 
added: "But these weapons are where we say they shouldn't be. 
The situation is not satisfactory from our position. Absolutely 
not."

  [Text] Today the [Serbian] aggressor has been forced to 
flee even further in the theater of operations of the 7th South 
Operative Group following joint attacks by fighters of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina [B-H] Army and the Croatian Defense Council 
[HVO]. Smajl Terzic reports: 
  [Begin Terzic recording] They [the Serbs] are fleeing from 
Novi Seher via Dubrave toward Teslic, and they are also 
withdrawing part of their forces via (Globarica) toward Mt. 
Ozren. This is the first time that this has happened since the 
outbreak of the war as their warlords well appreciate the power 
of the united forces of the 3d Corps, units of the 7th South 
Operative Group, and the two HVO brigades, the 110th Glorious 
Usora Brigade and the 111th Zepce Brigade. These territories, 
which were occupied for nine months, were indeed occupied only 
temporarily. 
  This great victory by the forces of the B-H Army and the HVO 
is the result of highly coordinated activities. It is in fact 
the result of Article 6 of the Washington Agreement concerning 
joint military activities of the B-H Army and the HVO on the 
ground. Therefore, this is the beginning of the end of the 
aggression, and it is taking place in the 7th South Operative 
Group's theater of operations. 
  By the way, the enemy has not been silent today. This 
morning he fired mortars at the villages of Jelak and Sije, in 
the theater of operations of the 207th Glorious Pousora Fierce 
Brigade, and [word indistinct]. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, March 19 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Deputy Prime 
Minister Zeljko Simic has described Yugoslavia's contacts with 
Croatia as encouraging and said that bilateral meetings are 
aimed at seeking concrete solutions to humanitarian problems and 
not at producing spectacular political results. 
  Simic was interviewed by the JOURNAL DE GENEVE daily, which 
introduced him as the first Yugoslav politician to visit Zagreb 
after Croatia violently seceded from the former Yugoslav 
Federation in 1991. 
  Speaking about the Moslem-Croat agreement on setting up a 
federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Simic said the Serbs would 
welcome the deal if it was to bring about the cessation of 
hostilities and peace in the republic. 
  The paper reminded its readers that Belgrade had made it 
clear to U.S. Presidential Envoy Charles Redman that there could 
be no solution to the Bosnian crisis without Bosnian Serbs and 
that political and military aspects of the situation could not 
be overlooked. 
  The Yugoslav Government maintains that the European Union 
has 
lost credibility in trying to resolve the crisis in 
ex-Yugoslavia, of which it has informed President of the E.U. 
Ministerial Council Karolos Papoulias of Greece during his 
recent visit to Belgrade, JOURNAL DE GENEVE said. 
  Paraphrasing Simic, it went on to explain that the European 
Community last December proposed that sanctions against 
Yugoslavia be lifted if Bosnian Serbs made territorial 
concessions to the Moslems. This condition has been met, the 
paper said, but the Serbs now have the impression that they have 
been pushed to the side. 
  Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) insists on the adherence to 
the democratic formula adopted at the Geneva-based International 
Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, according to which a 
solution to the Bosnian War is to be negotiated by all three 
sides to the conflict, the paper explained. 
  It quoted Simic as saying that the Yugoslav Government did 
not want to be directly involved in the upcoming talks in Zagreb 
between Croatia and the Republic of Serb Krajina, and that its 
dialogue with Croatia should be conducted on an equal footing. 
  This implies the lifting of the absurd anti-Yugoslav 
sanctions which have harmed both the Serb people and countries 
neighbouring on Yugoslavia.

[currency not specified] as a result of economic sanctions 
declared by the UN Security Council against various countries. 
It is likely, however, that at least a part of these losses will 
be compensated by UN bodies. 
  Damage resulting from the economic embargo imposed on 
Serbian-Montenegrin Yugoslavia in June 1992 was estimated at 
$290 million (approximately 8.56 billion Czech korunas [Kc]) 
late last year. The bulk of this sum, $260 million, is made up 
of claims by foreign trade companies for goods delivered before 
the embargo was imposed. The goods in question were mostly 
engineering products, vehicles, and some chemicals, Jiri 
Vetrovsky, director of the Ministry of Finance Foreign Exchange 
Department, stated. 
  In an explanatory statement on the bill, by means of which 
the Czech Republic joined the sanctions, the government voices 
the expectation that losses resulting from observance of the 
sanctions will be addressed in negotiations with the UN Security 
Council. 
  Of the countries that apply sanctions against Yugoslavia, 
the 
impact of the embargo is felt mostly severely by Romania, 
Bulgaria, and Hungary. Hungary's losses have already exceeded 
the sum of $1.3 billion. Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Geza Jeszenszky proposed the establishment of a UN fund, from 
which assistance would be given to states adhering to the 
embargo. Peace mediator David Owen also called for the 
compensation of losses last month. 
  For losses incurred in connection with the conflict in the 
Persian Gulf, in the course of which an embargo had been imposed 
on Iraq and Kuwait, the Czech Republic claims, for the time 
being, a compensation of approximately Kc7.3 billion. It is 
asserting this claim through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
with the UN Compensation Commission. 
  A total of 42 organizations suffered losses as a result of 
the embargo, of which 19 meet the UN conditions for 
compensation. The main part of the damages, worth about Kc5.5 
billion, is accounted for by claims for unpaid deliveries to 
Iraq and Kuwait. The remainder results from unsalable 
inventories, outstanding interest payments for credits extended 
under duress, and damage to property.

<F P=106> [Irina Yordanova commentary: "President Must Look Crisis in </F>
Eye"] 
  [Text] For a week now Bulgaria has been on the operating 
table. The picture of the illness is clear, for the symptoms 
have appeared repeatedly during the year since Berov's cabinet 
assumed office. The crisis erupted this week. 
  Bulgaria does not have a budget. Only a few days after the 
National Budget Bill was adopted, the national currency was 
devalued almost 25 percent. Increasing the basic interest rate 
will help to block the economy completely. 
  In a few days time we will know whether Bulgaria will 
receive 
a stand-by credit. Experts are convinced that, against the 
background of the crisis, there is little chance of reaching an 
agreement with the international finance institutions. 
Apparently, our state currency reserves are back at the level 
of 8 November 1991. In April the price of electricity and 
heating will increase. The Khan Kubrat vessel reaches Serbia 
with a full cargo, and returns empty.... 
  At the moment no one in Bulgaria is responsible for all 
this. 
  [Deputy Prime Ministers] Matinchev and Karabashev quarrel 
publicly. Lukanov says that the government is wonderful, and 
forgets about the promised cabinet changes. At their plenum the 
Socialists declare that they are relying on Berov. They are 
relying on a sick man who has undergone surgery to strengthen a 
state that is currently under the scalpel of an economic and 
political crisis. Ludzhev, Tomov, and the rest seek escape in 
the memories of 1990-91. Everyone tries to escape the present. 
  According to Article 108 of the Constitution the prime 
minister alone is responsible for the actions of the government. 
Each of the ministers is responsible for his own actions and 
not for the cabinet as a whole. 
  A long time ago the Union of Democratic forces called the 
Berov cabinet the government of irresponsibility. Today this 
definition applies to the entire state. 
  The head of state observes the political crisis from Paris, 
from above, or from the sidelines. In a normal state with such 
an abnormal situation the president would be holding urgent 
talks with the political forces. If Bulgaria wants to be a 
democratic state, then urgent institutional measures to solve 
the situation must be adopted. Appeals to the people and Sunday 
radio interviews are hardly a serious means of saving a state 
that is lying on the operating table. 
  President Zhelev should look the crisis in the eye.

<F P=106> ["Statement by Minister of Defense Valentin Aleksandrov in </F>
the National Assembly on 11 March": "Dialogue Is Only Civilized 
Method Under Democracy] 
  [Text] Esteemed Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: 
  Essentially, the petition of the Rakovski Officers Legion is 
largely addressed to parliament. The officers' intention was to 
convene in front of parliament after 13 March and submit the 
petition to the deputies. The petition contains three demands: 
  First: The demand to adopt the military budget requested by 
the experts of the General Staff. This involves the absurd 
figure of 37 billion leva. The matter has already been decided. 
The budget has been adopted. It is already law. Everyone must 
implement it. Whoever does not want to implement it has no place 
in the army. 
  Second: The demand to the people's representatives that they 
pass legislation to establish a concept of the "citizen in 
uniform." I think there will be a high degree of consensus on 
this matter with the adoption of the Law on the Armed Forces. 
  Such a concept exists in the German and Austrian armies. 
Other armies do not have such a concept. The concept would 
provide professional, legal, and social guarantees for the 
Bulgarian military. It is a very delicate issue, because it is 
a political-legal issue. 
  I must admit to you that as defense minister I am not 
inclined to accept the General Staff's interpretation in all its 
points, and say this for one simple reason, which is 
demonstrated by the fact that this is the thrid successive 
petition organized by the Rakovski Legion. Public awareness is 
not so high that we can allow complete freedom, especially in 
the armed forces. In one way or another, the army is based on 
subordination; it voluntarily accepts a certain limitation of 
individual rights, and anyone who becomes an officer should be 
well aware of this. 
  Third: A demand that was the basic element of this 21-point 
document, namely, that the president, the National Assembly 
chairman, the ministers of defense, internal affairs, and 
finance, and the chief of General Staff, discuss together with 
the trade unions the serious situation and our national security 
problems, and put forward real measures to deal with them. 
  This essentially is our job. Thus this third demand was no 
more than a storm in a teacup. 
  I do not think there is much point in reading the whole 
petition out here. It contains 21 points, some of which cannot 
be taken seriously. If we exclude the demand regarding the 
budget, which is essentially a political matter, there can be no 
doubt that the other demands, albeit debatable and poorly 
formulated, are justified to a point. This applies especially 
to the demands having to do with the social sphere and the 
material situation of the officers. 
  Another important thing is that these demands of the 
military 
are nothing new. I have twice made statements here in the 
National Assembly on these matters. The chief of General Staff 
has done the same. These demands have been put forward for 
public discussion since the legion was founded. I am sure you 
will support many of them. Their implementation as real policy 
requires several things. First -- goodwill. I am sure we all 
have a lot of it. However, there are two other things -- the 
law and finances. You certainly will soon debate the draft law. 
However, this year there will be no more money, and every army 
officer must understand this. There will be and cannot be any 
compromises in this respect. For me as minister of defense, 
these demands have another dimension, namely, the means used to 
try to resolve these problems. Unfortunately, the means by 
which some of the Legion officers decided to seek implementation 
of their absolutely correct demands are unlawful, and thus for 
me -- inadmissible. This is a clear case of violating the 
Constitution and military regulations, something that allows of 
no compromise. 
  Now for the second part of the issue. The reasons for the 
penalties. The basic reason was the attempt to eliminate once 
and for all the tendency to an increase in irregular and 
unlawful actions on the part of the military. 
  First, I would like to say that democracy has its limits 
and that will not allow those limits to be violated or crossed 
in the army. 
  Urgent measures had to be adopted because the lack of any 
reaction on our part when signatures were collected for a 
petition in defense of the former officer, Lyutskanov, created 
the impression among some people that they could act with 
impunity and total freedom -- something inadmissible under 
conditions of subordination. 
  Second, I would like to state this to the Bulgarian 
parliament with total clarity: Individual representatives of 
certain political forces are trying to manipulate from a 
political point of view some members of the Legion. Here the 
principle is clear: Every attempt to politicize the army, 
especially through its interference in the activity of state 
bodies or through issuing unrealistic demands to the detriment 
of other parts of society, must be finally eliminated. 
  It is easy to demand money. It is difficult to say where 
this money could come from. 
  Third, my order was not directed against the Legion and 
there 
is no conflict between the Rakovski Officer Legion and the 
Ministry of Defense. My order applies to officers, members of 
the Legion, who violated the laws of the country and the Armed 
Forces' regulations. There are and cannot be no compromises in 
this sphere. 
  The penalties that I imposed totally correspond to their 
specific violation. Captain Second Rank Vasil Danov was 
dismissed from the army on disciplinary grounds for systematic 
violations of discipline through instigation, and support of and 
participation in actions that undermine the prestige of the 
Bulgarian Army. 
  I would like to draw your attention to the fact that at the 
beginning of the year Nikolay Slatinski, chairman of the 
National Assembly National Security Commission, addressed an 
open letter to me with a request to draw the attention of the 
Armed Forces' prosecutor to the behavior of Captain Vasil Danov. 
Then I thought that he is a young man, he got carried away, 
etc., but now I see that this was a system of actions, and 
therefore, the consequences were clear. He was fired the same 
day. It was he who described the Rakovski Legion's letter as a 
"bloody letter," [referring to the letter written with blood by 
revolutionary Todor Kableshkov in April 1876, announcing the 
beginning of the April 1876 insurrection against the Turks], and 
as an overt rebellion. This was published in the newspapers, 
and I must say that the reaction in the army was none too 
positive. 
  Furthermore, Mr. Danov is a founding member of a new 
political organization, I do not know whether you have heard of 
it, called National Accord. As a rank and file officer he did 
not have the right to be a member of such organizations. He 
signed a declaration to this effect. This in itself is 
sufficient reason to fire him immediately. The participation of 
officers in such organizations creates unpleasant associations 
in areas related to the Ministry of Defense. I am convinced 
that I acted correctly, because it turned out that a large part 
of the people who signed the petition, especially in Khaskovo, 
were not aware of the complex character of the situation in 
which they found themselves. I must tell you that already on 
the following day three deputy defense ministers, three deputy 
heads of the General Staff, and military jurists visited the 
headquarters of the armies and talked to officers up to the rank 
of regimental commanders. Many things were cleared up during 
those talks. Obviously, the boys in Khaskovo have been 
manipulated. The Legion's leadership also has been manipulated, 
because only one of its members signed the declaration, while it 
was published on behalf of the entire Legion. This simply was 
not true. 
  Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, people's representatives, in 
the difficult situation that has developed in the country and 
the army we must not delude ourselves that there will be no 
officers, and civilians and politicians who would not sympathize 
with the officers whom I punished. The fear of restructuring, 
which is inevitable under this military budget, the cuts, and 
elimination of certain posts, prompt the military to express 
solidarity with anyone who demands a pay increase for the 
military. 
  In this manner one could speculate, implant harmful 
illusions, and turn the situation into an explosive one. 
  Yesterday we received the results of a sociological study in 
the army, which I commissioned. It shows that unfortunately, 
populism has found fertile soil in the army. This especially 
applies to garrisons, which are in a more difficult situation. 
I repeat, I cannot allow anyone to play with fire. I prefer 
the discontent with the penalties that I imposed, which could 
emerge among part of the officers and sergeants, to 
disseminating the delusion that more funds could be found 
through applying pressure on the cabinet, parliament, or myself. 
  The discontent with an order is less important than the 
possibility of polarizing the army through petitions, 
declarations, bloody letters, and so forth. 
  The situation in the army is very grave and if actions that 
are prompted by orders are not finally, radically, and once and 
for all stopped, the situation could become uncontrollable. As 
long as I am the minister of defense, I will not allow this. 
  With my order I only showed that their demands cannot be 
granted in this way, and that I will not allow the army to be 
led with petitions from the bottom to the top. 
  Dialogue is the only civilized method that is legally 
established in the army under conditions of democracy. I am 
always prepared for such dialogue. I have used this and I 
believe in it. This is precisely why I had a meeting yesterday 
with the leadership of the Rakovski Officer Legion. This 
organization is a legitimate organization, registered by the 
court, and not an handful of pretenders who write and sign 
"bloody letters" and declarations. 
  At that meeting four of the participants called the 
declaration an "immature act," and admitted its obvious 
political character. BULGARSKA ARMIYA has carried an extensive 
report on this matter and I do not want to bother you with it. 
  I would like to talk more often about those issues and I am 
always ready to come to parliament. I will present the demands 
and petition to the Secretariat, and we will do everything 
possible to adopt amendments at the second reading of the draft 
law that will prevent similar developments. I hope that we will 
be able to meet some of the officers' demands, but, let us not 
delude ourselves, we cannot meet all of them. 
  Thank you for your attention.

<F P=106> [Plamen Enchev commentary: "Khan Kubrat on Hudson River"] </F>
  [Text] After the "Bulgarian umbrella" and the attempt on 
the life of Pope John Paul II, Bulgaria has again been on the 
lips of journalists and its name printed on the front pages of 
the world's press. Ironic as it may sound, this time the code 
name is "Khan Kubrat" -- the vessel named after the founder of 
the Bulgarian state. This name can now be found in the UN 
Security Council's protocols. However, to judge by the noise 
made by some people ignorant of geography, one would think that 
the violator of the embargo on what is left of Yugoslavia did 
not sail along the Danube but along the Hudson River. 
  Only on 15 March, after the world organization had already 
expressed its opinion on the case, did Sofia remember to convene 
the Government Commission on UN Sanctions, and charge various 
departments with related tasks. From the official statement 
after the meeting it is now clear that the officials who allowed 
the scandalous escape or kidnapping of the vessel and the oil 
tankers will be held responsible. The incident took place on 3 
March. There is a saying that fits this situation -- it is 
called locking the stable door after the horse has bolted. 
  What Sofia's reaction would have been if the UN Security 
Council's statement had not been in our favor is interesting. 
Perhaps we would again have adopted measures and programs on 
observing the Yugoembargo. 
  The waiting position of the official authorities was evident 
throughout the entire case of the fugitive vessel -- from the 
first clear signs at the end of January that something was amiss 
with the vessel and its cargo to the strange circumstances 
surrounding the arrest and release of the majority of the crew. 
  Even more questions arise if you believe the stories of the 
sailors who made the pleasure trip to Prahovo and returned home 
unencumbered. Something is wrong with the whole scenario. The 
Yugoslav side could not provide a satisfactory explanation 
either, but of course this is understandable. More than 5,000 
tonnes of oil are important for the state subjected to the 
embargo, and in the eyes of the Serbs the high price is 
justifiable. 
  The question, however, is what is the Bulgarian point of 
view? Officially we declare that we observe the embargo, but, on 
the other hand, our position regarding the criminal violations 
that take place from time to time is, to put it mildly, a 
position of purely registering the violations. We even reached 
the point when foreign observers of the Yugoembargo claim that 
Bulgarian customs officials are corrupt. So far no one has 
officially confirmed these accusations. In addition, no one has 
explained why the customs officials allowed the Khan Kubrat, for 
which they were responsible at the port of Somovit, to escape. 
  On 15 March the port was closed to oil transporters. DUMA 
has learned that there are at least 40 additional tanker-tugs in 
this port, all of them of unclear origin and final destination. 
Hundreds of railroad tanker cars, the property of phantom 
companies, are traveling between various railroad stations. The 
time bomb is ticking away, and when it explodes, the echo will 
be heard in the city on the banks of the Hudson. 
  We have already been positively mentioned once in New York, 
something that made us famous. Should we risk a second 
assessment because of purely domestic reasons? 
  We have no solid guarantee that we will be praised again.

  [Text] [Announcer] The People's Assembly approved the 
draft of the state budget for 1994. Gezim Qinami reports: 
  [Qinami] This morning the People's Assembly continued 
proceedings in a plenary session to discuss the draft of the 
state budget for 1994. The deputies discussed it at length and 
later approved the draft with a majority. At the end of the 
session, we interviewed Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi. 
  [Begin Meksi recording] The People's Assembly today approved 
the state budget for 1994; it is the most important financial 
act for the government and country. Of course, the approval of 
the budget comes after long preparation by the government in 
every aspect -- in examining the possibilities of incomes, in 
planning expenses, and in carrying out a series of laws to do 
with the restructuring of the Albanian economy and the 
reformation of the organization of all judicial activity. 
  Of course, this budget bill was examined for approximately 
three weeks by the parliament's various commissions and remarks 
were made. The government considered these remarks, depending on 
the case, by debating with the deputies in the commissions, thus 
seeing the utility of these changes and reflecting these remarks 
in the budget, because when we withdraw money from one side, we 
need to balance the other side. 
  On this occasion, I would like to thank all commissions and 
deputies, regardless of party affiliation, for the valuable 
propositions made. This is a new experience for all of us, 
which will certainly be improved in the coming years. 
  Compared to a year ago, the state budget includes, of 
course, 
a series of improvements in its structure, as well as in the 
government's greater financial possibilities to face various 
problems, because we should consider that the budget deficit is 
lower this year. The financing of the state from abroad and 
banks is lower, thus, incomes are greater than before. At the 
same time, inflation has been forecast at 19 percent this year, 
compared to about 35 percent last year. 
  The government is experiencing more difficult working 
conditions, but the country's economic growth makes it possible 
to overcome it. Of course, this year's forecast is positive. 
While last year we had more than 10 percent increase in general 
production, this year it has been forecast at about 8 percent. 
My opinion is that it may even be more. Of course, it is up to 
all Albanians, as now it is not the government that is working 
to fulfill the plan, but all the free and private Albanians, 
just as the state enterprises. They deposit incomes into the 
state budget and the state can function to the benefit of all 
the citizens and Albania as well. 
  I wanted to say that we can implement many things this year 
because we close the second year of governing in a month and 
many things can be done as the Albanian economy has grown, the 
social basis of this state has been changed, private companies 
constitute the majority, and laws enabling the forward progress 
of the Albanian economy have been changed. However, one thing 
should be considered -- that Albanians do this. [ends recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Where the Budget Will Go -- Defense </F>
Privileged"] 
  [Text] Tirana -- Here are some of the main figures in a 
breakdown of the state budget for 1994. The data are taken from 
the Budget Bill just submitted to parliament. It is evident 
that the largest funds of more than 6 billion leks go to the 
Education Ministry. Most of this, or 4.4 billion leks, will go 
for local funding and only 500 million will be used for national 
funding. The Health Ministry comes second, with funds amounting 
to more than 4.9 billion leks. Two other ministries, those of 
construction and defense, are financed to the tune of more than 
4 billion leks. The state budget also gives priority to the 
Public Order Ministry and the Ministry of Labor and Social 
Welfare, both of which receive more than 2 billion leks. Of a 
total budget of 74.140 billion leks, more than 63.927 billion 
leks will be used for central funding. More than 13.551 billion 
leks of the budget will be used as investment finance.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "New Inflation Levels in the First </F>
Months of 1994"] 
  [Text] Tirana -- The tight monetary policy expressed in a 
squeeze on credit and budget expenditure continues to bear fruit 
in restraining inflation to relatively low and acceptable levels 
under conditions of economic crisis. Data from the Statistics 
Institute show that in January 1994, the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI), which remains the main indicator of inflation in Albania, 
rose 2.02 percent compared with December 1992. In February, the 
CPI rose 1.70 percent compared with January. It seems that 
higher prices for fuel and passenger transportation tickets in 
particular led to a rise in the index. The high profit levels 
enjoyed by traders on the market also continues to exert a 
strong influence on inflation. Before reaching consumers, goods 
pass through the hands of several traders, which increases their 
price artificially. It was this phenomenon that obliged the 
government a short time ago to reverse its policy of price 
liberalization and impose a price ceiling on sugar. 
  Starting from January, the CPI will be calculated on a new 
basis. "The year used as a basis for comparison will be 1994 
instead of 1990," Statistics Institute specialists told GAZETA 
SHQIPTARE.

<F P=106> [Ilirian Bardhi article: "A Victim That Accuses the State </F>
and Not the Real Culprit?! -- Why Does Mr. Keko Not Press 
Charges?] 
  [Text] The extreme politicization of ordinary and even 
banal incidents is nowadays becoming a mass epidemic. Even when 
people are entirely their own victims, are drunk, or are 
involved in immoral and illegal business, they advertise 
themselves or are advertised by others as heroes or innocent 
victims. 
  What is absurd is that in this case too, short-term and 
long-term political calculations have led to the state being 
held to blame. 
  It seems this epidemic has affected Teodor Keko. 
  Keko knows better than anybody how this incident happened. 
It 
is also well known that there is no Albanian who will step out 
in front of you when you are with your wife, if you have not put 
him down in a way you should not. 
  Of course, we do not excuse or in any way support the author 
of this act of violence, but on the other hand it is not fair or 
moral to purposely politicize for the purposes of publicity 
anybody's hooliganism, drunkenness, or ordinary scandals. 
  Keko intentionally and calculatedly accuses the state, when 
it is well known that he was struck in the presence of others, 
and that he knows his assailant and the motive for the attack. 
  Keko's failure so far to press charges against his assailant 
is highly significant and compromising. He would do well to 
turn to the organs of justice in order to fully expose the 
truth. Why does Mr. Keko not do this?

<F P=106> [Report by Teodora Encheva] </F>
  [Text] On 13 March an expanded plenum of the BSP 
[Bulgarian Socialist Party] discussed the party's program for 
the 41st BSP Congress. The OSD [Alliance for Social Democracy], 
ASO [Alternative Socialist Association], "Marxist Alternative," 
and "Road to Europe" groups expressed their views on the draft 
political document prepared by the Center for Strategic Analyses 
and Studies. Only the OSD presented its own program in written 
form. It will be disseminated in the same way as the draft 
document proposed by the "strategist Lilov." Lilov reprimanded 
those who unthinkingly reject the "Chinese model" of socialism. 
The BSP is a party of the poor, not of the destitute, he said. 
We are also defenders of the emerging "middle class," he added 
at the end of his speech. According to him, the transition in 
Bulgaria should take 20 years. First, he said, the country has 
to emerge from the grave economic and social crisis; second, it 
must adapt to the new "postindustrial" trends in the world. 
  Today we are discussing a party document, not state 
policies, 
his opponent [OSD leader] Chavdar Kyuranov pointed out. 
According to the OSD social democrats, the BSP center's program 
rediscovered the ideas of Khrushchev, Ataturk, and Mao, and the 
document's philosophy ignored the problem of property ownership. 
According to them, Lilov deliberately used the word "failure" 
instead of "collapse" with reference to the fate of the 
societies of real socialism. An OSD expert told STANDART NEWS 
that he predicts that the BSP will tolerate the postcommunist 
thinking of its present strategist for another five years at the 
very most, adding that time alone will turn the Socialists into 
Social Democrats. 
  The next plenum is to appoint a commission to work on all 
the 
draft versions of the party program and will also fix the date 
of the 41st BSP Congress.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Robert Levi: "Prince Turned Out To Be a </F>
Beggar"] 
  [Text] Before the plenum of the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
[BSP] held yesterday, 13 March, there was much talk about the 
luxurious cloak of pluralism that the BSP wanted to show off in 
the fashion show that they called a "debate." A show did indeed 
take place, but the models on the catwalk lacked variety, and 
this clearly demonstrated that the king was naked. 
  The gray-hairs were the first to gasp with horror at the 
cloak. They started complaining that the fashion designers had 
not included some very important accessories that they had 
suggested. In the "Panorama" program on television on the 
evening of 12 March, [BSP leader] Zhan Videnov assured them that 
the king's clothes were made up of at least five pieces, and 
that one of these was theirs. 
  However, in the show itself it turned out that the assembled 
fans of the king prefer one-piece designs, such as a sack with 
holes cut out for the head and arms. This was what the chief 
tailor Aleksandur Lilov actually proposed. He presented his 
design, called "New Times, a New Bulgaria, a New BSP," but at 
the very start apologized because, due to lack of funds, it was 
a more gaudy version of the miserable garments in which the 
party emerged from the 39th and 40th BSP Congresses, which were 
the "Manifesto for Democratic Socialism" and the "Platform for 
Further Renewal of the BSP." Aleksandur Lilov passed over with 
smile the creation of his chief competitor -- the house of 
Kyuranov, Yonchev, Dureva, and Sons. The public also ignored 
them, finding their well-known extravagance all too familiar. 
For this reason, the debates centered on the draft document, 
not the draft documents. This time, the extravagance of the 
social democrats in the BSP showed itself in the fact that the 
only difference between their draft document and Lilov's was its 
length -- they set their faith in placing "personnel mines" 
(again due to lack of funds). 
  The other designers, from the "Marxist Platform," 
Alternative 
Socialist Association, and "Road to Europe," contented 
themselves with saying that they would present their versions in 
a week's time, and that they would not be different, but merely 
a critical comment on the main design. Some wanted to tack onto 
the latter a piece on the left side, others wanted to put it on 
the right side, and yet others wanted to cover up the holes cut 
out in the front -- that is, in the center. 
  Some observers on the sidelines expressed their amazement 
that all the models looked as if they had come out of the same 
fashion house, with all of them carrying the same decoration in 
the very front, namely "democratic socialism." In addition, all 
of them circle around the hat of "power." 
  At the end the chief advertising agent [DUMA Editor in 
Chief] 
Stefan Prodev complained that no money was available to publish 
individual photographs of the models, which were in any case 
identical. 
  In the final analysis, what emerged from the meeting will be 
demonstrated to the people in the next elections, so that all 
will be able to see that the king is naked and the prince is a 
beggar. Otherwise, the show goes on.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Goran Gotev: "God Save Us From Bulgarian </F>
Janissaries"] 
  [Text] If you know who is in power in the Western Outlands 
[border region of Serbia inhabited by ethnic Bulgarians], you 
will not be surprised at the demand of the authorities in 
Bosilegrad Municipality to ban the Democratic Alliance of 
Bulgarians in Yugoslavia (DSBYu). Both there and in almost all 
the other settlements with a Bulgarian population Bulgarian 
janissaries are in power. Five hundred years of servitude have 
taught us that no oppressor is more terrible and vile than they. 
They are the mayors, municipal councillors, judges, and police 
chiefs who have long been in the service of an alien faith and 
an alien language. 
  Otherwise, everything appears to be civilized and normal. 
When the Serbian authorities receive delegations from Bulgaria 
-- and there have been plenty of them of late -- they assure 
them that in the areas with a predominantly Bulgarian population 
in eastern Serbia our compatriots occupy leading places in the 
administration and in municipal life. Moreover, the Bulgarian 
language, even if it is not the chief language, is only so 
because the Bulgarians themselves want it so. 
  Later our delegations meet these mayors, municipal 
councillors, judges, and police chiefs, from whom they hear the 
same thing, and then return to Bulgaria enchanted by this new 
Arcadia, where everything flows with milk and honey. They then 
start publishing one article after another in which they try to 
convince the other 8 million Bulgarians that those who defend 
the rights of the Bulgarians in the Western Outlands are a 
handful of dubious personages who want to provoke a quarrel 
between us and Serbia, which shows abundant love toward us. 
  As this is going on, our compatriots can barely make ends 
meet, because not a single new workshop has been built for 
decades in their villages, forgotten by both Belgrade and Sofia. 
They try to come to terms with their children's new Serbian 
names, hoping that they at least will not have to suffer as they 
are, and even regard with distrust the enthusiasts from the 
DSBYu, because they have known for ages that every time a voice 
is raised in defense of the Bulgarians violated rights, only 
misfortunes and torment follow. How can they fail to think like 
this, when even in their motherland people were found to assure 
us that everything is fine in the Western Outlands? Who then is 
to tell our compatriots that the other minorities in former 
Yugoslavia have been fighting for their rights for a long time 
and will certainly win their rights and freedoms through their 
struggle? Who is to tell them that the time for bowing one's 
head is already long past? 
  The totalitarianism here, like totalitarianism anywhere 
else, 
has created an impression of ostensible democracy. The Serbian 
Parliament has no deputies from a party that defends the 
Bulgarians' rights, nor will it ever have any. A fiendishly 
cunning electoral system has divided the Bulgarian settlements 
in such a way that in all the electoral constituencies a Serbian 
population predominates that will never support a Bulgarian 
candidate. However, Bulgarian deputies from the ruling parties 
have served in parliament and will certainly continue to do so. 
The trouble is that history has not recorded the name of a 
single Bulgarian deputy who has said at least two words in 
defense of his compatriots. Precisely the opposite is the case 
-- to this very day they are remembered only for having defended 
the rulers' policies more fervently and furiously than the 
rulers themselves. When the enthusiasts, who included some of 
the most eminent and respected names of Bulgarians in 
Yugoslavia, founded the DSBYu, the Belgrade mass media poured 
out rivers of defamation and abuse. The first legal political 
organization of Bulgarians that had appeared in the Western 
Outlands since their separation from Bulgaria in 1918 was 
stigmatized not by Serbs, but by Bulgarians. They even signed 
their denunciations and gave their addresses, so as to be sure 
receive their thirty pieces of silver. 
  I know that every undemocratic government needs such 
traitors, and that every such government rewards them highly by 
quickly promoting them up the ladder of the administrative 
hierarchy. However, I also know that any self-respecting 
government cannot fail to hold them in contempt. 
  Therefore, I think that if Belgrade listens to the calls of 
its Bosilegrad informers, if it bans the only organization of 
Bulgarians of the kind that all the other minorities in the 
multinational state possess, this will mean that Belgrade has 
lost its own sense of self-respect.

<F P=106> [Lazar Tomov commentary: "Consensus -- Separately"] </F>
  [Text] We have lived finally to see a prudent unity of 
thought, and even a noble competition between the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] and the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS]. 
Of course, by unity of thought we must understand a similar 
position on the part of the leaders of the two political poles 
in the country on the situation of the Bulgarians in the Western 
Outlands [border region of southeastern Serbia populated by 
ethnic Bulgarians]. The political consensus on this issue, 
which was anticipated for a long time, was inevitable. It is a 
positive thing, because after all, the issue preserves the 
Bulgarian character of this Yugoslav region populated with 
Bulgarians. 
  Provoked by the unofficial announcement on banning the 
Democratic Alliance of Bulgarians in Yugoslavia, Filip Dimitrov 
and Zhan Videnov immediately reacted. Their statements differed 
only on the issues of who should help our compatriots and by 
what means. 
  There can hardly be a serious political force in Bulgaria 
that has a different opinion on this issue from the BSP and the 
SDS. It was the same 75 years ago, when for a long time no 
Bulgarian politician could be found who was prepared to sign the 
Treaty of Neuilly [treaty signed on 27 November 1919, by which 
Bulgaria ceded territories to Serbia and Greece and lost about 
300,000 citizens]. We know what kind of peace it brought to the 
Balkans. We could see the consequences in the Western Outlands, 
and not only there. One remembers the universal joy that 
engulfed the country after the return of Southern Dobrudzha in 
1940. 
  Naturally, we are not speaking about any correction of our 
border with Yugoslavia, but about a normal and humane attitude 
toward our compatriots in the Western Outlands, as they 
requested in the memorandum they addressed to the UN Human 
Rights Commission in Geneva. 
  The SDS and BSP have committed themselves to this demand. 
The two political forces are not interested in a political 
flirt along patriotic lines, but in real actions in the sphere 
of scientific and cultural exchange, and in respecting the 
religious freedom and rights according to international 
documents. Let us hope that the divided Bulgarian Orthodox 
Church will follow the example of the politicians, and that the 
Holy Synod (which of the two?) sends Bulgarian priests to the 
Western Outlands on time, as the population there has requested.

<F P=106> [Konstantin Subchev commentary: "Officers and Clerks"] </F>
  [Text] Despite the experiments that have been going on now 
for five years, the situation of the Bulgarian Army is not 
stabilizing but, on the contrary, is becoming tragic. At 
present Albania is the only Balkan neighbor on whom we can rely, 
although even this is doubtful. 
  There was no place from where the 37 billion leva requested 
by the Rakovski Officer Legion could come. Subsequently, the 
Defense Ministry will have to make do with what it has. 
  Cuts are inevitable in such a situation. 
  What is bad is that in such cases the proverb that while the 
fish begins to stink at the head they are beginning to clean it 
at the tail applies to Bulgaria. 
  If the current army payroll does not change, even the 
Brazilians and Thais, who are proverbial for their "inflation" 
of higher military ranks, will begin to laugh at us. 
  Today there are 22,000 officers, 27,000 sergeants, and 
36,000 
soldiers in the Bulgarian Army. In other words, for every 
soldier there is one payroll officer or sergeant. 
  That is one aspect of the problem. The other is that the 
cuts of officers and sergeants that have been carried out 
created the suspicion that a political purge was under way, or 
more precisely a process of settling personal accounts and 
striving to survive on a political pretext. As a result there 
are not enough platoon and company commanders for combat units, 
while the headquarter offices are full. 
  Now they say that the army must be cut 50 percent if it is 
to 
be maintained within the framework of the current budget. This, 
however, does not prevent new lists of high-ranking officers who 
should be promoted from being presented. 
  At Slivnitsa the Bulgarian captains defeated the Serb 
generals. This means that the number of stars on the shoulder 
straps have nothing to do with the state of the army. 
  As Clausewitz said, "victory is a result of the number of 
soldiers and the personal qualities of the officers." 
  We do not have enough soldiers. We cannot even dream of 
having a professional army because of purely financial reasons. 
At least let us make sure that after the next cut the army 
manages to retain young and able officers rather than clerks and 
bureaucrats in uniform. 
  Clerks are incapable of being in charge of defense, or God 
forbid, waging a war.

  [Text] A fax sent to us by the Romanian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs announces that it greets with satisfaction the signing 
in Washington of the accord on the creation of a bicommunity 
federation by the Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats and of the 
accord on the principles of a possible confederation between 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. 
  The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the 
signing of these documents represents an important step toward 
decisively involving all sides in the continuation and 
finalization of the negotiations aimed at a global settlement of 
the Yugoslav crisis. 
  Emphasizing the decisive contribution made by the United 
States to the achievement of these accords, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs assesses that, through the sustained efforts by 
the international community, one can achieve viable and 
realistic understandings that will contribute to solving a 
large-scale conflict in the heart of Europe by political means, 
a conflict that causes tremendous human suffering and great 
material damage. 
  The communique reaffirms the Romanian Government's complete 
readiness to contribute, through its means, to supporting the 
current positive processes of reestablishing peace and settling 
problems in keeping with the major interests of the newly 
emerged states on the territory of former Yugoslavia and of 
their neighboring countries in the interests of security and 
peace.

<F P=106> [Report by Andrei Costa: "The Recent Government Reshuffle </F>
Has a Worrying Political Significance"] 
  [Text] The Executive Bureau of the Democratic 
Party-National Salvation Front [PD(FSN)] released a declaration, 
which was made public yesterday, during the weekly news 
conference of that political party. We reproduce the text of 
the declaration: 
  "The Democratic Party has taken notice, with profound worry, 
of a number of recent public actions, culminating in the recent 
government reshuffle, which damages the honor of Romania's 
military, create an atmosphere of unrest and dissatisfaction 
within the armed forces of the country, and, in this way, 
weakens Romania's national security. 
  "The aforementioned actions began by the irresponsible and 
slanderous attacks, having an anti-Romanian character, launched 
by the Greater Romania Party [PRM] against the leadership of the 
armed forces and the Ministry of National Defense, especially 
against [former National Defense Minister Lieutenant] General 
Niculae Spiroiu. Neither the government, nor any other 
institution of the state or any of the parties belonging to the 
current government coalition, deemed it necessary, despite the 
circumstances, to raise its voice in support of the Romanian 
Armed Forces and to defend the honor of this country's military. 
The Superior Council of the army was abandoned and condemned to 
standing there alone facing this unprecedented aggression. 
  "What is even more, the government reshuffle that followed 
created, at least, the impression -- if reality is not even 
worse than the impression -- that they are complying with the 
demands of the extremist and antidemocratic forces, which are 
obviously promoting interests that are alien to those of 
Romania. In this context, it is not the appointment of a 
civilian person to lead the Ministry of National Defense -- a 
customary thing in democratic countries -- that creates concern, 
but rather the replacement of an internationally appreciated 
officer, who was oriented toward the strengthening of national 
security by means of our Euro-Atlantic integration, by a greatly 
disputed person, whose connections with Ceausescu's Securitate 
are far from being fully cleared up. Even if one accepts that 
certain departments of the former Securitate had merely 
technical tasks in serving the country, it is still not 
tolerable, without running huge risks for our national peace, 
that employees of the said departments should now take control 
of the great work of the administration of the armed forces. 
  "Being preoccupied with the possible negative consequences 
the aforementioned events might exert upon the morale and the 
efficiency of the Romanian Armed Forces, the Democratic Party 
requests from all state power factors that they should 
immediately initiate measures to restore and safeguard the honor 
and security of the armed forces, the cornerstone of our 
national edifice. 
  "Similarly, we also request that the Commissions for 
Defense, 
National Security, and Public Order of [the two chambers] of 
Parliament should urgently intervene by investigating this case, 
verifying the various presuppositions referring to the real 
causes that led to the changes in the leadership of the Ministry 
of National Defense, clear up of the personal situation of the 
current defense minister, as well as indicate permanent and 
urgent parliamentary solutions intended to safeguard the moral 
and action integrity of the armed forces, the guarantor of our 
country's independence and sovereignty.'' 
  Talking about the recent government reshuffle, Mr. Adrian 
Severin [deputy chairman of the PD(FSN)] assessed that it was 
not what it had been intended to seem, namely that will not lead 
to the improvement of the government's performance by the 
contribution of new experts, being rather a political act, in 
the best case, a premature one, having a worrying political 
significance. His conclusion was alarming: It seems that 
certain levels of Romania's Government are beginning to act 
autonomously and, cooperating with the other parties of the red 
pentagon [reference to the National Romanian Unity Party, the 
Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania, the Socialist Party of 
Labor, and the Greater Romania Party, currently supporting the 
ruling party], excluding the Social Democracy Party of Romania 
[PDSR], they are trying to set up an autonomous bloc. It seems 
that Prime Minister [Nicolae] Vacaroiu and his close aides had 
an essential role in the government reshuffle. If one connects 
this to a number of other phenomena, which had been detected 
earlier, Severin said, one might reach the conclusion that the 
recent dialogue between the forces of the opposition and the 
party having the relative majority, the PDSR, has triggered an 
alarm reaction on behalf of the government and the other parties 
of the red pentagon, representing the most substantial part of 
the extremist, xenophobic, and antidemocratic parties.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Romanian Transportation Minister </F>
Traian Basescu by Ana Maria Vintan; place and date not given: 
"As Long as They Are in Power, I Will Not Give the Evidence to 
the General Prosecution"] 
  [Text] [Vintan] Mr. Basescu, in what sense in President 
[Ion] Iliescu involved in the espionage case you mentioned? 
  [Basescu] I clearly said that confidential documents of the 
Petromin company were transferred to General [Nikos] Grylakis in 
Greece, the route being Romanuel Posedaru [one of the directors 
of Petromin], [former Romanian Transportation] Minister [Paul] 
Teodoru, and General Grylakis. I do not know whether the 
documents were personally handed over by Minister Teodoru or 
rather [presidential counselor] General [Vasile] Ionel. I 
presume, it was General Ionel. My presumption is based on the 
fact that I cannot imagine Minister Teodoru holding talks with 
an intelligence general [Grylakis], because he is too bright to 
establish direct ties with an intelligence general. 
  [Vintan] Do you mean you never referred to President Ion 
Iliescu? 
  [Basescu] No, I never referred to him. It is the merit of 
your daily to have also mentioned Iliescu's name, although I am 
not prepared to state that the things published by ROMANIA 
LIBERA were lies. 
  [Vintan] For how long have you been holding these pieces of 
information? 
  [Basescu] For a very short time, and I also have evidence. 
Otherwise I would not venture to make such assertions. I have 
never asserted anything publicly without also being able to 
prove it. The case of Romanuel Posedaru may be explained in the 
following way: He handed them [the documents] over upon the 
orders of Minister Teodoru. The responsibility for delivering 
those documents to Grylakis mostly lies with Teodoru. 
  [Vintan] The persons you accused are asking why you need to 
interpret a commercial transaction as an espionage case 
involving the highest-level officials of the state power. 
  [Basescu] First let us take a look at the Forum 
Maritime-Petromin deal. There was this insignificant and honest 
Katounis, a person who did not have either a bad or a good 
reputation in the shipping business; he was merely an obscure 
shipping businessman. Well, one fine day he unexpectedly comes 
to conclude a contract by which he would have taken control of 
51 percent of Romania's oil tankers and ore carrier ships [the 
Petromin fleet]. This man had received the necessary 
information, by way of that Arab, Taher, before he came here to 
conclude the contract. He held information both regarding the 
financing contracts and the commercial contracts that had been 
concluded by Petromin. He is not a dumb person and this is 
proved by the fact that by the end of 1993 the company began to 
make profit. Currently its profits amount to 500 million lei. 
So he came precisely at the right time. In 1993, he intended to 
sign a contract by which he would have taken over the company. 
At the same time, Minister Teodoru was making a great fuss 
everywhere claiming that Basescu had left him a bankrupt 
Petromin [company]. But look here, it is not bankrupt at all. In 
June 1993, Teodoru and [Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae] 
Vacaroiu claimed vehemently that 51 percent of Petromin ought to 
have been sold to Katounis because the company was going 
bankrupt. And look what happened, eventually the contract did 
not become effective and the company is making money. This 
means that they [Teodoru and Vacaroiu] lied to justify an 
unfavorable contract. Under such circumstances, if a prime 
minister and a minister sign a contract that is later declared 
illegal, normally they should have no other choice but to step 
down. 
  [Vintan] What is your opinion about the arrest of the four 
former Petromin directors? 
  [Basescu] This is a political game, in which -- 
considering that the contract has been declared illegal -- the 
state power, Teodoru and [Ion] Honcescu [head of the Prime 
Minister's Control Corps] have staged the whole thing by having 
the four former Petromin directors arrested. 
  [Vintan] Do you think they are innocent? 
  [Basescu] Absolutely! They are victims of a major hoax 
intended to fool public opinion. The press also made a great 
fuss about it, of course, because it is a spectacular case. All 
this happened on the eve of the court ruling on the 
Petromin-Forum Maritime contract, in which Teodoru and Vacaroiu 
are fully involved. Everyone let themselves be led astray by the 
hoax and ignored precisely what was essential, namely that, for 
the first time ever, a government decision is rejected by our 
justice. And that the prime minister and a minister, who were 
coauthors of that illegal decision are now fine, thank you very 
much, and on top of it they are given the chance to be appear as 
the defenders of the people for having ordered the arrest of the 
four [directors]. 
  [Vintan] What do you intend to do with the evidence you 
have? 
  [Basescu] My number one priority is to convince [the court] 
that the four persons have been arrested for nothing. You might 
also find it difficult to believe that. I was not involved in 
any illegal dealings together with the four, they are simply 
four colleagues of mine, four innocent people who are victims of 
the dispute between myself, on the one hand, and Vacaroiu and 
Teodoru on the other. I hope I will be able to address an open 
letter to Teodoru and Vacaroiu to point out the illegal dealings 
they are involved in and to prove that they are abusing these 
people, and that the day will come when they will be held 
responsible for it. 
  [Vintan] Do you intend to hand the evidence over to the 
General Prosecution? 
  [Basescu] No, as long as those people are in power I will 
not do that. I know they control the prosecution. 
  [Vintan] You know that your party [Democratic Party -- PD] 
has concluded a nonaggression pact with the PDSR [Social 
Democracy Party of Romania -- ruling party]. The majority of 
the persons accused by you are orbiting around that party. 
  [Vintan] I do not want to hear about political pacts. If 
need be, I will become an independent parliamentarian, but I 
will still defend my opinions. They wanted me to be a member of 
the [PD] commission that held negotiations with the PDSR, but I 
refused, precisely because there is nothing I can negotiate with 
such partners.

<F P=106> [Letter addressed by Lieutenant General Marin Pancea, </F>
secretary of the Supreme Defense Council and counselor to 
President Ion Iliescu, to Ion Cristoiu, editor in chief of 
EVENIMENTUL ZILEI] 
  [Text] Mr. Ion Cristoiu, 
  Being convinced of the fact that the following will be 
integrally published in the pages of the daily you head in order 
to more "fully" inform public opinion, I am sending you this 
letter and also ask for your concrete support. 
  I have learned from the 14 March 1994 issue of EVENIMENTUL 
ZILEI that I have a new capacity -- besides being a KGB and GRU 
agent, about which I also learned from the press, and that news 
was also carried by EVENIMENTUL ZILEI as well -- namely that now 
I am also "a spy for the French secret service." 
  Owing to the fact that the remuneration I am entitled to 
from 
that secret service to which you referred has yet not been 
remitted to me, I am asking for your support in my efforts to 
collect the amount the French secret service owes me in exchange 
for the information I offered them about the sessions of the 
Supreme Defense Council of the country, and which, according to 
EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, were "channeled" there via your hero, Radu 
Petrica Popa, whom the daily you head presented not as a crook, 
but rather as a victim of deception. 
  I am counting on your "good will," because as far as I can 
see, you have already specialized in investigating and clearing 
up cases such as mine, although, considering that this is an 
espionage case, you should have kept total secrecy and "whisper 
about it solely in my ears," and then we might have been able to 
find a mutually profitable formula to "secludedly" split the 
reward I am entitled to from the French secret service and 
which, I presume, must be a very substantial one, given 
especially my high capacity, rank, and value. 
  However, owing to the fact that your daily has already aired 
the issue in public, we now have to obey the rules of 
consistency, because now we cannot afford to hide anything and 
therefore I hope that you will accept that our mutual 
"cooperation" should be done also in public, although in this 
case, I ought to warn you, I am not ready to split the dollars 
with you. 
  Hoping that you will publish this letter and thanking you in 
advance for your support, yours, 
  THE SECRETARY OF THE SUPREME DEFENSE COUNCIL OF THE COUNTRY 
[title in capital letters as published], 
  Lieutenant General Marin Pancea

<F P=106> [MEDIAFAX interview with Lieutenant General Marin Pancea, </F>
secretary of the country's Supreme Defense Council, counselor of 
President Ion Iliescu; place and date not given: "General Marin 
Pancea Believes That the Attacks of the Press Are Actually 
Directed Against the Presidential Institution"] 
  [Text] [MEDIAFAX] Mr. General, in your opinion, what is 
the source of the information alleging that you are an agent of 
the French secret service? 
  [Pancea] The source on which the article published by 
[daily] EVENIMENTUL ZILEI relies intends, in my opinion, to 
mislead, rather than correctly inform public opinion. Probably 
we have to deal with certain circles that are interested in 
circulating information that can deceive and especially mislead 
public opinion in Romania. As a matter of fact EVENIMENTUL 
ZILEI is known as a daily that, rather unfortunately, instead of 
following a line that could lend it a note of seriousness in the 
way it discusses the approached issues, has for a very long time 
proved to be rather a scandal paper, a sensation paper, and it 
still seems to be following that line, in its usual style. 
  [MEDIAFAX] Still, who do you think offered them that piece 
of information? 
  [Pancea] I do not merely think, but I am also certain that 
all this information has been forged by someone who uses it to 
cause a sensation. It may not be the daily itself, but rather 
certain circles that are interested in such a thing; I do not 
wish to name anyone, because I do not have absolute evidence 
about the existence of such enemies. That is life, I think that 
one may have friends as well as foes, but sometimes it is very 
difficult for one, in the middle of this flood of information, 
to spot the persons who might be envious of one. 
  [MEDIAFAX] Have you or have you not been transferred to 
reserve duty by President Iliescu? 
  [Pancea] I have no knowledge of that. I did not discuss 
that issue with the president, either before he left or after he 
returned home [from his tour of Lithuania, South Korea, and 
China]. Of course, the president knows about my intention to 
retire, considering my advanced age compared to the [retirement 
age] currently existing in the armed forces. I am almost 66, so 
you realize that, in the army, I am considered one of the oldest 
officers, even among the generals. As it is known, according to 
both the currently valid status of military cadres and to the 
one that is being discussed in parliament, the maximum age is 62 
years. This means that I already exceeded that limit by four 
years. 
  [MEDIAFAX] Have you spoken to the president about your 
problem? What is his opinion? 
  [Pancea] I have not spoken with the president because -- and 
you will have to agree -- his agenda is full of other issues, 
far more important ones than my problem, and if he were to deal 
personally with everything that is published by the press, he 
would not have enough time to deal with the issues he, as the 
country's president, is expected to solve. 
  [MEDIAFAX] The item that accused you of espionage also 
claimed that you have been recruited by Tudor Anescu. What are 
your relations with that person and, of course, with the other 
two: Lucian Cornescu and Radu Petrica Popa? 
  [Pancea] If we also take into consideration the things 
published by other papers (EXPRES MAGAZIN and TINERAMA), 
initially I was a KGB agent who was recruited, as TINERAMA 
claimed last year, by some KGB agents in the old days, while I 
was a military attache in Paris. What do I see now? Probably 
because they did not achieve their goal by claiming that I was a 
KGB agent, they changed course and called me an agent of the 
French secret service recruited by Mr. Anescu. As far as I 
could understand from the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI item, they claim 
that I recruited Anescu, and later on, he, as a double agent, 
managed to exploit me for intelligence purposes; I am mentioning 
all this in order to be correct and to refer exactly to the 
things published by EVENIMENTUL ZILEI. They are all aberrations 
and imaginary assertions made by a person who is not in his 
right mind, lest I should call him insane. In connection with 
Lucian Cornescu, I can tell you that during my service in Paris 
I had contacts, but not with him, but rather with many other 
French companies, with the purpose of purchasing military 
technology and equipment needed by the Romanian army. Of course 
not all those deals were eventually concluded with French 
companies. I can give you one example of a deal that was 
concluded and I can also tell you that nothing came out of the 
ones [mediated by] of Cornescu, because he did not offer terms 
and items that were of any interest to the Romanian army. 
Contrary to him, other companies were successful, such as the 
Alouette-3-type helicopter, for which, initially, we imported 
spare parts, after which we imported the whole manufacturing 
technology. 
  [MEDIAFAX] Do you mean that their connecting Lucian 
Cornescu's name with this issue was purely accidental? 
  [Pancea] That is right, he has no connection with this. 
That was merely business. The allegations in the 
aforementioned item are mere hallucinations. Radu Petrica Popa 
is the person who swindled my son of $30,000, in the sense that 
he promised to obtain an apartment for him and requested an 
advance payment; besides my son, other persons were swindled in 
the same way and their cases were reported by the press. Radu 
Petrica Popa is a notorious, or a professional, crook; I have 
never seen him and I talked to him just once, over the phone. 
What actually happened was that he began to blackmail my son, 
threatening that if he would not withdraw the complaint he filed 
with the police requesting his money back, "your father will be 
kicked out of Cotroceni" [presidential headquarters]. 
  [MEDIAFAX] Is he really such an influential person? 
  [Pancea] I do not think so. However, I think that he was 
manipulated by other influential persons who were interested not 
so much in discrediting me personally or my son, but rather in 
discrediting me, the Pancea who works for the presidency, that 
is, their attacks were actually directed against the 
presidential institution and the president, personally. 
  [MEDIAFAX] Do you think that you are standing in someone's 
way? 
  [Pancea] Personally, I cannot think of any elements from 
which I could draw the conclusion that I am standing in 
someone's way, I mean, in the way of some other physical person. 
I believe that here we have to deal with the interests of 
certain circles or forces that are very interested in weakening 
certain structures of the Romanian state, including the council 
or the secretary of the Supreme Defense Council, which, after 
all, is one of the principal bodies of the defense structures of 
this country, considering the issues it is expected to discuss 
during its sessions and the decisions it is expected to take 
regarding national security. I do not think that I, as a 
person, could be standing in someone's way; the institution I 
represent could, perhaps. 
  [MEDIAFAX] Do you think that they are the same circles I 
referred to in my first questions? 
  [Pancea] I believe they are the same circles, because the 
events were connected among themselves in such a way so as to 
turn an incident between two individuals into an attack against 
an institution, namely the presidential one. Their attempt to 
try to deal a blow, not against the place where the events 
actually took place, but rather way up, against the presidential 
institution is quite obvious. 
  [MEDIAFAX] Is it true that during one of the sessions of the 
Supreme Defense Council it was suggested to the president that 
he should renounce his visit in France precisely because of the 
problem with you? 
  [Pancea] That is a totally wild aberration, which has 
absolutely no connection with reality. Besides, during the 
sessions of the Supreme Defense Council, we do not discuss the 
visits of the president. That is the task of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, our embassies, and the presidency, and not at 
all that of the Supreme Defense Council, which has no authority 
in such issues. 
  [MEDIAFAX] You are a French agent, Mr. Adrian Nastase 
[speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and executive chairman of 
the ruling party] is a CIA agent (according to Corneliu Vadim 
Tudor); how do you account for their "silence" about the 
possible KGB agents? 
  [Pancea] Actually we should not talk about the "silence," 
but rather try to assess this "rain of agents" in the press and 
handle it according to what it deserves. I, as an expert in 
this field, can tell you that it does not deserve any attention. 
The fact that such things are published by the press, in my 
opinion, is a consequence of our not having an appropriate bill 
on the press, on the basis of which one could seriously call to 
account all the persons who circulate such concocted things 
lacking all real grounds. Being an agent is a very grave thing, 
it is high treason against one's homeland, and agents do not 
deserve to remain among society, they ought to be shot or 
isolated in prisons. 
  [MEDIAFAX] Many personalities have been accused of spying 
for Western powers [reference to Greater Romania Party leader 
Corneliu Vadim Tudor's open letter claiming that top government, 
presidential officials are working for Western intelligence 
agencies]. How do you account for the fact that, over the past 
four years, very few people have been accused of working for the 
KGB? Do people's minds and imagination not work in that 
direction as well, in that of [the officials'] cooperation with 
the KGB? 
  [Pancea] As an expert in this field, I can tell you that all 
intelligence services, regardless of the state they belong to, 
have to establish the goals of their intelligence activity in 
such a way so as to best serve the interests of their state, be 
they military interests -- which currently are not quite 
plausible, especially after the dissolution of the Warsaw Treaty 
-- or be they scientific or economic interests, on the one hand, 
or in the field of arms and drugs trafficking and terrorist 
activity, because currently these are the fields of major 
interest at the international level, and therefore the majority 
of the intelligence services of various developed states, which 
do have such specialized structures, are principally targeted in 
these directions. This does not mean that they neglect military 
aspects. If we take just the military part of the intelligence 
work, beginning with Napoleon's time, all military attaches had 
the task to gather military information with the purpose of 
preventing the adversary from taking one by surprise in case of 
a possible crisis.

<F P=106> [Report by Branislav Bozic from Banja Luka] </F>
  [Text] Croatia is demanding from the U.S. Administration 
that [Bosnian President] Alija Izetbegovic be replaced before 
the realization of the Washington accord, which was recently 
signed by the Muslims and the Croats, begins. This was reported 
by Banja Luka radio this evening. Branislav Bozic reports: 
  [Bozic] Before the Washington agreement is realized in 
practice, according to which the Bosnian Croats and the Muslims 
would first establish a federation and then form a confederation 
with Croatia, it is necessary to replace Alija Izetbegovic. 
This condition was set to the U.S. Administration by Croatian 
President Franjo Tudjman prior to the signing of the agreement. 
This was reported by Banja Luka radio tonight, citing 
well-informed Croatian sources. The report further states that 
the White House has taken a similar stand for some time. The 
additional argument was Franjo Tudjman's explanation that he had 
replaced Mate Boban who, according to him, is an extremist among 
the Croats. 
  Not only was Tudjman promised that Alija Izetbegovic would 
be 
replaced, but, as Banja Luka radio reports, he was also told 
that Izetbegovic will be replaced by either Haris Silajdzic or 
Muhamed Sacirbey, ambassador of the Muslim government in the 
United Nations. All this, as claimed, will happen very quickly.

  [Text] Several meetings at the UN headquarters in New York 
marked the end of the visit by a Croatian delegation, headed by 
President Tudjman, to the United States. The first meeting, with 
UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, lasted 45 minutes and took 
place in an open and working atmosphere. 
  President Tudjman thanked the United Nations for its efforts 
to achieve peace in southeast Europe. However, there can be no 
peace until the issue of UN-protected areas in Croatia is 
resolved. Croatia calls for effective control of its borders in 
accordance with resolution 769 of the UN Security Council. It 
insists on restoring Croatia's authority over the so-called pink 
zones. In line with resolution 820 of the UN Security Council, 
trade with the protected areas cannot be undertaken without 
exclusive permission from Croatian authorities. Three UN 
Security Council resolutions, 815, 847 and 871, which confirmed 
that the protected areas are integral parts of the Republic of 
Croatia, will continue to provide the foundations for resolving 
this issue. In Croatia's view, the resolution of the issue of 
the protected areas will release UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] 
military units to perform other tasks and will at the same time 
help to resolve the world organization's financial difficulties. 
  Croatia called for implementation of the UN General 
Assembly's resolutions which provide for funds to finance the 
reconstruction of the destroyed parts of Croatia. 
  Following his meeting with Butrus-Ghali, President Tudjman 
met the UN Security Council. President Tudjman stressed 
Croatia's readiness to cooperate with the UN Security Council 
and the UN secretary general in implementing the UNPROFOR 
mandate. The Washington agreements mark a watershed in the 
peace process, President Tudjman said, and went on to emphasize 
the major role played by the United States in reaching the 
agreements. This positive development should be seized and used 
to achieve peace in Croatia. Peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina will 
not last unless there is peace in Croatia. Serb extremists 
refuse to cooperate with Croatia and the authorities in Belgrade 
have not been behaving in line with the agreement to normalize 
relations between Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  The positive experience from Bosnia-Herzegovina, where a 
resolute threat of force proved effective, should be used in the 
efforts to resolve the issue of the protected areas. Croatia 
has offered a high degree of autonomy to the Serb population in 
the areas where it was in the majority according to the 1991 
census. 
  In conclusion President Tudjman called on the UN Security 
Council and the world organization to help create conditions for 
the resettlement of several hundred thousand refugees.

<F P=106> [By Milan Dragovic] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb, March 22 (AFP) -- Croatian authorities and 
separatist Serbs from Croatia's Krajina region began negotiating 
a comprehensive ceasefire agreement Tuesday [22 March] in hopes 
of building on a Moslem-Croat peace pact for Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The meeting at the Russian Embassy here, organised by 
Russia's special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin in 
coordination with U.S. officials, is the first of its kind to be 
held in the Croatian capital under the auspices of the UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR). 
  The two sides last year held several similar meetings in 
Norway and Austria -- with the Serbs demanding neutral territory 
for the talks -- but without success because of Serb insistence 
on autonomy for the Serb-dominated Krajina region which they 
have proclaimed an independent "republic." 
  John Mills, the spokesman for the international peace 
conference on former Yugoslavia, told journalists the 
discussions would focus on "a comprehensive ceasefire and 
separation of forces" of the two factions. 
  The Serbs of Krajina occupy a quarter of Croatian territory, 
and Mills acknowledged that separating the two forces was a 
"very difficult problem." 
  Zagreb has until now opposed any withdrawal of Croatian 
forces across a demarcation line, which would imply UN 
involvement, on the ground that this would undermine Croatia's 
sovereignty. 
  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has ruled out any kind of 
"enlarged autonomy" for the separatist Serbs and is demanding 
the unconditional return to Croatia of Krajina, a UN protected 
area. 
  Last week he asked the UN Security Council to authorise the 
use of force to disarm the rebels and he is insisting that the 
UN peacekeepers, whose mandate for operations in Croatia is up 
for renewal at the end of March, maintain strict control of the 
border. 
  Churkin has worked closely with his White House counterpart 
Charles Redman, who helped broker the Croat-Moslem agreement on 
a federation in Bosnia that was sealed in Washington on Friday. 
  But further progress in efforts to end more than two years 
of 
fighting in former Yugoslavia now depends on a solution to the 
"Serb question". 
  "The first thing to do is to sign a very solid document, 
which will ensure that fighting will not return in and around" 
the Krajina region, Churkin said last week following talks in 
Zagreb and Belgrade which laid the ground for Tuesday's meeting. 
  Two international mediators, Norwegian ambassador Kai Aide, 
representing the United Nations, and his German counterpart, 
Gert Ahrens, representing the European Union, were attending the 
meeting here Tuesday along with U.S. Ambassador Peter Galbraith. 
  Representing the Croatian delegation were Hrvoje Sarinic, 
head of the secret police and liaison officer with the UNPROFOR, 
and Slavko Degoricija. 
  The separatists were represented by Rear Admiral Dusan 
Rakic, 
who is the rebel Serbs "defence minister", Slobodan Jarcevic, 
the "foreign minister" and Mile Novakovic, in charge of security. 
  Croatian intellectuals, opposed to any dialogue with the 
Serbs who they consider to be war criminals, have called a 
protest demonstration in central Zagreb later in the day.

  [Excerpt] Norwegian Foreign Minister Godal has hosted a 
lunch for Mate Granic, vice president of the [Croatian] 
government and foreign minister. In his toast he stressed the 
shared responsibility of the international community for 
resolving the problems of the former Yugoslavia and expressed 
appreciation for Croatia's way of resolving humanitarian 
problems. He also offered further humanitarian aid and accepted 
with pleasure the Croatian minister's invitation to visit our 
country. 
  Speaking about the agreement reached in Washington, he said 
that it was very good and that it would receive positive 
reactions in Norway. Croatian Minister Mate Granic then held a 
news conference at which he explained the importance of the 
Washington agreement. He added that within the next 10 to 15 
days negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina's organization will also 
start with the Bosnian Serbs. At this news conference, which 
attracted a great deal of attention among Norwegian media, 
Minister Granic also explained Croatia's standpoints regarding 
the resolution of occupied areas in the Republic of Croatia. He 
stressed that the Croatian authorities are willing to give local 
autonomy to the Serbs in the protected areas as well as all 
rights in keeping with international laws. 
  Granic stressed the importance of normalization of relations 
between Zagreb and Belgrade and mutual recognition among all the 
states of the former Yugoslavia. He added that this would be 
impossible without the reintegration of the protected areas into 
Croatia. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Drgoljub Stankic from Knin] </F>
  [Text] The assembly of the republic of Serbian Krajina is 
continuing its work. The deputies are trying to adopt a platform 
of work of the Krajina delegation at the negotiations in Zagreb 
tomorrow. Dragoljub Stankic reports from Knin: 
  [Stankic] The assembly commissions met in the morning. This 
was followed by a discussion in the assembly on amendments to 
several bills. The speeches heard today were much calmer and 
more composed than the ones heard yesterday, before the 
resignation of Bjegovic's cabinet. Passions have calmed and 
everyone is now turning toward the most important issue -- the 
negotiations with the Croatian delegation that will be held in 
the Russian Embassy in Zagreb tomorrow. This was also the 
reason for the session of the foreign affairs commission. 
  It is worth mentioning that the views of the commission, the 
parliament, and the government concerning the negotiations in 
Zagreb are identical. The parliament last night confirmed the 
composition of the Krajina delegation at the talks. Its members 
are: Admiral Dusan Rakic, defense minister and head of the 
commission; General Mile Novakovic, state security adviser of 
the president of the republic; and Foreign Minister Slobodan 
Jarcevic. The first comments here are that the negotiations 
with the Croatian side have been going on for a long time, 
ranging from New York, Geneva, Oslo, to Dobanovci, and that 
nothing will be changed in the (?continuation). 
  Here in Knin they are particularly stressing the importance 
of the report by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali who, 
requesting the extension of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] 
mandate, is mentioning Croatia and Krajina as two entities. 
  Therefore, in the negotiations, the Krajina delegation will 
insist on the withdrawal of the Croatian Army from the occupied 
territories in Krajina, as well as demand the extension of 
UNPROFOR's mandate for 12 months, which is identical to the 
stand of the UN secretary general.

  [Text] Belgrade, 21 Mar (TANJUG) -- Veljko Knezevic, head 
of the Yugoslav bureau in Zagreb, said today that he and an 
eight-member bureau delegation were to travel to Zagreb this 
week. He told Belgrade radio's "An Argument More" program that 
humanitarian questions, the reestablishing of telephone and 
traffic links, payment of pensions, and other similar questions 
would be the primary tasks for the bureaus in Zagreb and 
Belgrade. Knezevic said it was necessary to raise the relations 
between Yugoslavia and Croatia to a higher level, which would 
imply opening of consular missions. 
  Commenting on the talks scheduled for tomorrow at the 
Russian 
Embassy in Zagreb between representatives of the republic of 
Serb Krajina and Croatia, Knezevic said it was very positive 
that the Serb side had agreed to the talks and was leaving with 
a clear aim to end combat activities as soon as possible. 
  The head of the Yugoslav bureau in Zagreb believes that very 
important issues, such as the opening of traffic and telephone 
links between Croatia and Yugoslavia, were impossible to resolve 
without the consent of the republic of Serb Krajina, since they 
cross its territory. The solution for these problems, Knezevic 
stressed, can be found only in direct negotiations between 
Zagreb and Knin. A solution for Serb-Croat relations should be 
sought in the same context, he believes. 
  Slobodan Jarcevic, the foreign minister of the republic of 
Serb Krajina, told the same program that at the talks tomorrow 
with Croatia in Zagreb, the Serb side would demand from the 
other side first of all to sign a peace agreement, but not to 
the detriment of the republic of Serb Krajina. A withdrawal of 
the Croatian army and police from the occupied Serb territories 
will be demanded, Jarcevic said. He recalled that the United 
Nations had guaranteed territorial delimitation between the two 
ethnic communities on this territory in 1991. "If the world then 
provided guarantees for the borders it should now preserve 
them," Jarcevic said. Asked if he feared the trip to Zagreb, 
Jarcevic said: "We do not fear travelling to any foreign 
country, not even to Croatia."

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 22 (AFP) -- UN officials and Bosnian 
Serb military leaders have agreed to settle amicably the 
controversial discovery of heavy weapons inside the NATO-imposed 
exclusion zone around Sarajevo, a UN spokesman said Tuesday [22 
March]. 
  Major Simon MacDowall, spokesman for the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR), said the weapons -- tanks, anti-aircraft guns and 
mortars -- were discovered Sunday by Canadian troops in the 
village of Cifluk right at the edge of the 20-kilometre 
(12-mile) exclusion zone set by NATO. 
  He said the weapons were placed under UN control even though 
the Serbs consider Cifluk outside the exclusion zone. 
  The Serbs have defined the exclusion zone by using 
Sarajevo's 
cathedral as the central point from which to calculate the 20 
kilometres while the UN defines the centre about a kilometre 
further west from the cathedral. 
  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and UNPROFOR chief of 
staff in Bosnia, Dutch General Adrian van Ball, held a meeting 
in the Serb stronghold of Pale Monday and agreed to negotiate 
the controversy. "Van Ball came back very satisfied with the 
positive attitude of the Bosnian Serbs," MacDowell said. He said 
the exclusion zone could not be entirely monitored by UN 
peacekeepers because of a lack of manpower. He added, however, 
that the situation had been relatively calm since NATO issued an 
ultimatum February 9 threatening air strikes unless the Serbs 
and Bosnian government troops withdrew their heavy weapons from 
around the besieged capital. He said UN military observers had 
noticed that troops on both sides appeared more relaxed on the 
frontlines and there was "no more sniping in Sarajevo." "That 
forward momentum is still going on," he said.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 21 Mar (TANJUG) -- A meeting was held in 
Pale today between Dr. Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska 
republic [RS], and Stanislav Galic, commander of the 
Sarajevo-Romanija corps of the RS army, on the one hand, and 
Dutch General van Baal, UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] chief of 
staff for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, on the other. The aim of 
the meeting was to clarify the latest controversy surrounding 
UNPROFOR accusations that a small amount of Serb heavy weapons 
was found inside the 20-km exclusion zone around Sarajevo in the 
locality of Cekrcici, north of Sarajevo and in the vicinity of 
Visoko. 
  "Today we came to the conclusion that we had used different 
maps to identify the central point inside the Sarajevo exclusion 
zone. This led to misunderstanding between UNPROFOR and the Serb 
side," General van Baal said after the talks. He went on to add 
that an agreement was reached today to "start work on defining 
the positions tomorrow," in order to identify the central point 
in the controversial zone. Meanwhile Karadzic will talk by 
phone with Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's envoy. We 
were in complete agreement regarding the situation in connection 
with the weapons inside and outside this zone and I think that 
today we achieved great success in the resolution of this 
problem, General van Baal said, expressing his gratitude to the 
Serb side and President Karadzic himself for their extremely 
good cooperation and understanding. 
  Sarajevo-Romanija Corps Commander Major General Stanislav 
Galic said the meeting today was very successful. He stated 
that the misunderstanding arose due to different interpretations 
about where the center of Sarajevo is. "These misunderstandings 
have now been resolved, which is yet another illustration of the 
effective cooperation between UNPROFOR and the civilian and 
military authorities of the Srpska republic," General Galic said. 
  UNPROFOR and Srpska republic representatives also met today 
at the Bratstvo-Jedinstvo bridge which is to be reopened to 
traffic on 23 March. UNPROFOR representatives for the Sarajevo 
sector and the Serb authorities in Sarajevo have agreed on 
details and technical particulars regarding the flow of traffic 
across this very sensitive location. UNPROFOR has been carrying 
out intensive preparatory work, the necessary marking and the 
protection of the bridge, and it is indicative that on the Serb 
side of the bridge, Russian UN troops were replaced by French 
UNPROFOR soldiers this morning.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 21 (AFP) -- UN forces found heavy 
weapons including tanks, anti-aircraft guns and mortars inside 
the NATO-imposed exclusion zone around Sarajevo, a UN spokesman 
said Monday [21 March]. Calling it a "big violation" of the NATO 
demilitarization plan, Major Simon MacDowell, spokesman for the 
UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR], said Canadians troops had found 
the arms late Sunday [20 March] in the area where six 120mm 
howitzers had been found on March 4. He said: "They determined 
that there are a considerable number of weapons there, more than 
the six." The newly found weapons included four tanks, three 
anti-aircraft guns, one 405mm howitzer and 18 mortars, he said. 
  In Brussels, NATO said the weapons belonged to Bosnian Serb 
forces. 
  In Sarajevo, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said Monday 
he was not surprised at the weapons find. Izetbegovic, returning 
from Washington after sealing accords with Bosnian Croat leaders 
to create a Croat-Moslem federation, said: "We are not 
surprised. We think those weapons exist in much greater 
numbers." The Bosnian Government had made reports warning of the 
existence of Bosnian Serb weapons inside the exclusion zone, he 
said. 
  MacDowell added that local-level negotiations between the 
Canadians and Serb had "not achieved any results in getting the 
weapons moved out or put under UNPROFOR control." Although near 
the edge of the exclusion zone, the arms were very near the 
Sarajevo-Visoko road, which is supposed to be opened to limited 
civilian traffic on Wednesday [23 March]. Izetbegovic, asked if 
people would need permission to use bridges and the three 
corridors into Sarajevo being reopened Wednesday, said only 
those "charged with some offence" would have their movements 
restricted. MacDowell said the United Nations was trying to 
arrange a high-level meeting between Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic and top UNPROFOR officials at Serb headquarters in Pale 
near Sarajevo to resolve the arms violation standoff. "The Serbs 
cannot withdraw straight back out since they've backed up right 
to HVO (Bosnian Croat) [Croatian Defense Council] lines," 
MacDowell said. He stressed however that "these guns are not 
capable of engaging Sarajevo. We have them now under 
observation." The spokesman added: "But these weapons are where 
we say they shouldn't be. The situation is not satisfactory 
from our position. Absolutely not." 
  Meanwhile Izetbegovic expressed hope that opposition from 
the 
Bosnian Serb side to the Bosnia federation agreement signed 
Friday would be resolved at future talks. "There will be an 
attempt to find a peaceful solution on all the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with the Serb side," he said. The Bosnian 
president added that he would invite Croatian President Franjo 
Tudjman to Sarajevo to discuss a separate plan for a loose 
confederation between Croatia and the Moslem-Croat federation. 
  Meanwhile Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Siladjzic, who also 
made the Washington trip, said any negotiation with the Serbs 
would "start with the question of returning land and will always 
go back to this question."

  [Text] Belgrade, March 22 (TANJUG) -- Police in the 
Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) stopped Monday a French U.N. 
battalion convoy carrying from Croatia ammunition to Moslems in 
western Bosnia, writes Belgrade's daily POLITIKA EKSPRES. 
  The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 by Serbs in the Serb 
ethnic 
and historical territories in response to Croatia's forcible 
secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and Croatia's 
violations of human and national rights of Serbs there. It lies 
between the former Yugoslav Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
Croatia. 
  The Belgrade daily set out that the French convoy was 
stopped 
at the Krajina-Croatia Turanj border-crossing and that the 
explosive cargo was intended for the Moslems in the Cazin 
region, a Moslem enclave in western Bosnia. 
  The UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] members presented the 
papers for the cargo showing they were carrying 720 rounds of 
mines for 80 mm mortars, 60 smoke pots, 112 packs of teargas and 
21 signal rockets which the Moslems in the Cazin region used as 
a gift from NATO, the daily said. When asked by the R.S.K. 
border police to examine the cargo's content and establish it 
matched the description in the papers, the check was not 
allowed. After that the R.S.K. police returned the convoy to 
Croatia, the daily noted. The daily added that one day (Sunday) 
prior to this event Canadian UNPROFOR member tried in the same 
way to drive six trucks with 10 tonnes of ammunition towards 
their base in the Lika area, but lacking permission and prior 
announcement were turned back to Croatia. 
  One may understand the claim that UNPROFOR was 
"replenishing" 
its ammunition stocks, but the question remained what the 
teargas and smoke grenades and mines were for, asked the daily. 
"Does the U.N. expect some special military action soon and 
what kind? Perhaps this action is to be veiled by a smoke 
screen, so that there can be no detection from which side 
hostile action comes from. Or is this the "dowry", as ordered, 
for the latest Croatian-Moslem "marriage" in the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina for some future time?" the daily 
asked. 
  The Bosnian Moslems and Croats, who clashed for the past 
year 
for domination over territories, signed under U.S. pressure last 
Friday in Washington an agreement on forming a Moslem-Croatian 
federation in Bosnia which would later form a confederation with 
the neighboring Croatia. 
  Political analysts say the motive for creating the 
Moslem-Croatian federation and subsequently a confederation with 
Croatia was to isolate and pressure the Serb side into accepting 
the peace settlement as designed by the West.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1305 GMT on 21 March carries a live 
relay of the news conference by Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency 
President Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic, and Bosnia-Herzegovina Justice Minister Kasim 
Trnka on the recent signing of the Bosnian-Croatian 
federation/confederation agreement in Washington. The questions 
are posed by unidentified correspondents either in English or 
Serbo-Croatian and a simultaneous translation is provided both 
ways. The news conference lasts approximately 40 minutes 
  All the answers by President Izetbegovic and Prime Minister 
Silajdzic are fully texted. 
  Before the first question is asked, Izetbegovic tells the 
reporters that "there will be no special statement. We have 
given enough of those. We are at your service." 
  Asked whether the federation/confederation agreement is the 
"final solution" to the relations with the Croats and whether 
the same is planned with the Serbs, Silajdzic says "I am afraid 
that the term final solution has bad connotations, but the 
solution is in the federation, and it has been done in good 
faith. I hope that it will be implemented in good faith. The 
same solution would be, and is going to be presented to the 
Serbs and offered to them for acceptance. This is all I can say 
about it. The draft constitution is already there, and is of 
course available in English. Thank you." 
  An unidentified reporter asks whether the federation and 
confederation with Croatia allows the Serbs, or their republic, 
to confederate with Serbia, and Silajdzic says that "It is only 
natural that the Serbs live in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I must 
remind you here that the whole federation concept is based on 
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Within that, it is only natural that the Serbs, the Bosnian 
Serbs, have certain ties with Serbia. That is of course a 
matter for discussion at negotiations." 
  Replying to the question as to when the confederation 
agreement could come in force, Izetbegovic says "After the 
solution to the entire issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina, that is, 
after the issue with the Serbian side is resolved. If that 
issue is not solved within a reasonable amount of time, then the 
sides will agree on whether to start the implementation of the 
confederation agreement. However, we will first try and find a 
solution with the Serb side in Bosnia- Herzegovina, that is, 
find a peace solution for the entire Bosnia." Izetbegovic then 
says that "I have proposed to President Tudjman that he come to 
Sarajevo, this invitation is in the works, and I think it will 
be sent out today. I do not know how you have already heard of 
it. This is this morning's decision. I think that it is high 
time President Tudjman came to Sarajevo. The invitation is to 
be sent out because we believe that it would be a step toward 
the implementation of the agreement. There are also certain 
practical issues that could be solved on that occasion between 
Bosnia- Herzegovina and Croatia. There are many such issues and 
that is why I believe that this visit will be useful." 
  Asked to comment on the decision of UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali to end the work of the commission for the 
investigation of war crimes, Silajdzic says that "I have heard 
about the announcement by the secretary general that the 
commission would cease work. This is the war crimes commission. 
I do not know about any definite decisions, I only know about 
the announcement. I must say that it surprised all of us. War 
crimes are war crimes and cannot be [word indistinct] by 
investigations. War crimes cannot be ended by an administrative 
decision. Nobody has the right to forgive the war crimes in the 
name of the victims. It would be very unusual, and I think that 
it would set a precedent if the commission were to cease work 
investigating war crimes on account of a lack of funds. We are 
sure that the commission will continue to work, and the funds 
will be found for the commission to continue." 
  Izetbegovic adds that "I could say here that the funds have 
already been secured by private sponsors, even though we do not 
think that this will be sufficient. The United Nations must 
continue to finance the commission. I am sure that the work of 
the commission will not cease regardless of whether the United 
Nations will continue to finance it. We will try and make sure 
that the United Nations continues to do so." 
  Responding to a question regarding the solution to the issue 
of territories that have been ethnically cleansed or are under 
Croatian control, Silajdzic says that "The federation is based 
on universally known human rights, and the human rights are 
practically the main ingredient of the draft constitution, the 
main part of the draft constitution. The right of return is one 
of the rights that will be implemented in this federation. It 
is quite clear that all the people who have been expelled from 
their homes will have the right to return to their homes. The 
minimum that we can do for those who have suffered so much is to 
give back to them the basic right to return to their homes." 
  Izetbegovic interrupts, saying that "I would only add here 
that the results of ethnic cleansing will be ignored in all 
solutions. All the information, and the draft constitution 
clearly says so, [changes thought] the demographic picture will 
be the picture represented at the census of 1991. Therefore no 
ethnic cleansing will be taken into account. There is a certain 
provision for that in the constitution." 
  Silajdzic says "If I may add, human rights are placed 
immediately after the establishment of the federation. So 
before any division of responsibility between the federation, 
the government, and the cantons, before anything else, there are 
human rights. It is no coincidence, this is based on our 
conviction that what has happened in Bosnia is actually a savage 
and gross violation of human rights." 
  A reporter asks whether there will be any government-imposed 
restrictions on the movement of the population after Sarajevo is 
opened, and Izetbegovic says that "there will be no restrictions 
except those that your government, too, would impose. Only 
persons against whom criminal charges have been brought will not 
be allowed to leave the city. I would like to stress that it 
was us, our government, who insisted that the roads be opened as 
soon as possible. We have demanded the opening of the southern 
road, the road that goes via Hadzici. The Serb side, however, 
was opposed to this. Therefore there will be no restrictions 
apart from the usual ones." 
  The same reporter asks whether a "mass exodus" is expected 
once the city is opened, and Izetbegovic replies that "I expect 
that far more people will enter the city than leave it. We are 
afraid of problems connected to that, the program of 
accommodation, employment, food, and so on. No, we do not 
expect that the people will leave the city. However, we will 
not prevent anyone who wants to leave from doing so." 
  Asked to comment on the fact that the United Nations have 
found a number of heavy weapons within the exclusion zone around 
Sarajevo, Izetbegovic says that "I have not received this 
morning's statement, but we know. I think that two or three 
times at these news conferences, you will remember, we have been 
pointing to the fact that there are still weapons within the 
exclusion zone. We have been pointing to these things. 
According to our information, there are a lot more of those 
weapons. I would like to remind you of a report we sent out 
some 15 days ago and, as far as I can remember, these weapons, 
these tanks, were mentioned there." 
  Asked to comment on the fact that the Herceg-Bosna 
Representative Council has issued a statement that they would 
condition the federation agreement on the confederation 
agreement, Izetbegovic says that "There is a provision in the 
signed document that the confederal agreement would be 
elaborated on after the federation is implemented. As far as I 
know, that was also the view of the Croatian side during the 
negotiations. However, we do not exclude a different solution 
if an agreement is reached. I do not think that anything stands 
in its way except that, in our view, the problem of peace should 
be solved in Bosnia-Herzegovina prior to the establishment of 
the confederation. This has been the general view, to do that 
before entering the confederation with Croatia." 
  Replying to a question on the protection of human rights, 
Justice Minister Trnka gives a detailed account of the 
provisions in the draft constitution regarding various courts 
that would be authorized to deal with such matters. Izetbegovic 
adds that "Apart from the court for human rights, there will be 
the institution of ombudsmen, which, by the way, originates from 
Nordic law, and these will naturally consist of local judges. 
However, during the transitional period, during the first four 
to five years, European and international judges will take part 
in the work of these bodies. They will be nominated by the CSCE 
and the International Court of Justice. Anyway, during the 
first five years, foreign judges will also participate in these 
bodies. Both institutions, the court for human rights and the 
institution of ombudsmen, will exist." 
  Asked by a reporter about the territory of the future 
federation, Silajdzic says that "I think that, if I may say so, 
Article 1 says that the federation will consist of those 
territories with majority the Bosniak and majority Croatian 
populations. That is the definition of the federation. The 
definite maps will be drawn after we conclude the talks with the 
third side." 
  Another reporter asks Izetbegovic what will happen if the 
referendum in Croatia rejects the confederation agreement, and 
Izetbegovic says that "If it is rejected and if, according to 
their laws and their constitution, a referendum has to be held, 
so if it is rejected, then there will be no confederation. The 
federation and the confederation are not linked. We have gone 
for both the agreements, however, from the legal point of view, 
these are not two connected things. The federation has been 
detailed, and it will become valid when the Assembly ratifies 
it. That is when it will become valid. As for the 
confederation, that depends on whether [words indistinct] and of 
course -- you asked me what if a referendum in Croatia rejects 
it -- there will be no confederation. However, the federation 
stays. The confederation is an agreement between two sovereign 
states." 
  An unidentified reporter cites a statement by Ivan Bender, 
member of the Croatian delegation, that there can be no 
federation without the confederation, and Izetbegovic says that 
"Mr. Bender is not authorized to give such statements. That 
will be done by the relevant bodies. That is his personal view 
and we have to respect that, but he is not authorized. This is 
just the personal and individual view of Mr. Bender." 
  Replying to a question on the future relations with the 
Serbs, Izetbegovic says that "we will start any talks with them, 
regardless of the options on offer and those accepted, with the 
demand for the return of the territories. I can repeat that, 
and I have said it before, we still stand on that position. Any 
talks with the Serb side, and of course we still do not know who 
will participate -- you know that there will be a Serb assembly 
on Sunday [26 March] -- we will wait for the results of this 
assembly before any talks. This assembly is a very important 
body, and it is an important event. Anyway, we will start any 
talks with them with the issue of returning territories, and the 
talks will develop depending on the response to that question. 
I would like to stress in connection with this Serb Assembly, 
that the Croatian assembly in Sarajevo on 6 February was a very 
important occasion in the things leading up to the Washington 
events." 
  A correspondent asks whether there was any talk in 
Washington 
about the Government's minimal territorial demands, and 
Izetbegovic says that "there was no talk of that. I can only 
say that questions regarding maps did arise, particularly during 
the last meeting prior to our departure. That was only an 
exchange of views, not a demand for us to define our minimum. 
We repeated our demand that the territories had to be returned. 
I did not have the impression that such a demand was rejected 
or that it was met with disapproval."

  [Text] In spite of major defeats and withdrawal from the 
occupied territories in Novi Seher, Perkovic, and Vobanice, the 
aggressor continues to engage in provocations and combat 
activities. Throughout the night as well as early this morning 
the enemy has been attacking the Tesanj-Novi Seher road and 
defense lines of the units of the 7th South Operative Group, as 
well as the settlements of (Mekis), (Karadaglije), and (Radusa) 
from its stronghold in Crni Vrh. The chetniks also attempted 
several tank and infantry attacks on the Doboj front. All these 
attacks were successfully resisted, primarily thanks to the 
soldiers of the 203d Famous Motorized Brigade Doboj-Bosnia, and 
the 110th Famous Brigade of the Croatian Defense Council Usora. 
In addition, new military hardware and manpower from Novi Seher 
have been observed arriving in this area. 
  The chetniks were also provoking the defense lines with 
small 
arms at of the [word indistinct] 207th Famous Hill Brigade, but 
naturally without any results.

  [Text] Bileca, March 21 (TANJUG) -- There is no peace 
between the Croats and Moslems in Mostar despite the Washington 
agreement on a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia. 
  On Monday the Moslems lodged yet another protest with the 
U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) accusing the Croats for 
violating the ceasefire in Mostar and its surroundings, said 
Sarajevo Radio in Monday. 
  Members of the Bosnian Croat armed force (HVO) without any 
provocation opened strong infantry fire on the separation lines, 
while in the central parts of the city the HVO fired from 
hand-held rocket launchers on Moslem positions, Sarajevo Radio 
said. The Moslem radio failed to say whether the Moslems had 
returned fire or if there had been any casualties. 
  A representative of the Moslem authorities on Sunday 
expressed doubt that life in Mostar would return to normal soon 
despite the Washington agreement. The Bosnian Croats and 
Moslems have for the past year been engaged in fierce battles in 
Mostar in an attempt to divide the city, from which they have 
expelled almost all the Serbs, into two ethnically clean parts. 
  The representatives of the Bosnian Moslems and Croats in 
Washington submitted to strong U.S. pressure to set up their 
federation in the territory of the former Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and a subsequent one with the republic of 
Croatia. 
  Political analysts believe that Washington's initiative aims 
to isolate the Bosnian Serbs and pressure them to make 
additional territorial concessions.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 22 March reports the 
following combat situation in the country over the last 24 hours: 
  Correspondent from Bihac Mirza Sadikovic reports that 
"bestial actions and attacks in the Bihac region continued all 
of last night until now. The Serbian aggressor has been 
attacking the defense lines in Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, Hasin 
Vrh, and [word indistinct] with all available arms." As 
Sadikovic continues to report, "our defenders are offering 
heroic resistance." He also says that "Cazin and Bihac commune 
were shelled early last night and this morning. There were 
numerous casualties among the fighters and the civilians." 
  A dispatch from Mostar by the Information Service of the 4th 
Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army reports that "over the last 
24 hours the fighters of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] on 
several occasions seriously violated the cease-fire agreement on 
the Mostar battlefield. The HVO extremists have opened fire 
with portable grenade launchers at the separating lines and the 
town center throughout the night. The HVO snipers in the House 
Economics School were not sitting idle either." "The chetniks 
displayed intense combat activities on all battlefields in the 
zone of responsibility of the 3d Corps," the 3d Corps 
Information Service reports. "In the Bosna River valley, the 
chetniks in Blizna attacked the villages Medik and Luke with a 
Bofors gun and Smaljbasici from a B-1 gun. With 34 shells from a 
120-mm caliber mortar the chetniks shelled our positions in 
Djedovac and Zedni Vrh yesterday evening. Karadzic's criminals 
from Vlasic opened fire at Turbe, using mortars and Bofors gun. 
At approximately 1800 they attacked with a B-1 gun. The 
consequence of this shelling are three injured civilians." It 
is also reported that "the chetniks in Komare fired one tank 
shell at Travnik." The 3d Corps then adds that "the cease-fire 
between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO is more or less 
being observed. More serious cease-fire violations have been 
noted in the region of (Luknica) and Brdjani in the Bosna River 
valley, where the HVO soldiers fired one explosive device and 
displayed intense small arms fire." 
  Reporting from Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says that "the Serbian 
aggressor continued to shell the lines of Brcko's defense over 
the last 24 hours. Yesterday at midday the enemy carried out a 
powerful artillery attack at our positions in Djukici. From the 
direction of Sekulic, the chetniks fired nearly 100 projectiles 
of 60-mm and 82-mm caliber." Deronjic adds that "the positions 
of our fighters on Kladje-Djukici line were the most frequent 
target of aggressor's mortars in the course of last night. The 
chetniks were attacking the central part of defense of the free 
Brcko territory with antiaircraft guns. Two powerful explosions 
that echoed in the most densely populated part of the 
temporarily occupied Brcko at 1140 yesterday confirm that the 
Serbian fascists continue to destroy the biggest town of the 
Bosnian Posavina."

<F P=106> [By Milos Solaja] </F>
  [Text] Banja Luka, March 21 (TANJUG) -- One member of the 
army of the Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) was killed and two were 
lightly wounded Monday in infantry and artillery attacks by the 
forces of the Bosnian Moslems on the Kupres Height, an important 
strategic point in the southwest of the former Yugoslav republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  According to the Bosnian Serbs' military sources, the Moslem 
attacks on Kupres continued for the sixth day. 
  The same statement said the Bosnian Serb forces were forced 
to return fire and repel the attack as well as re-gained some 80 
percent of the territories the Moslems seized several days ago. 
  The fighting in the Kupres war zone was another step in the 
preparations for a major Moslem offensive planned for spring 
this year. The attack on the Serb positions, 15 kilometers east 
of the town of Kupres, was somewhat of a surprise as the Moslem 
forces were not expected to show a stronger interest in this 
part of Bosnia-Herzegovina at this stage of the war. 
  The third warring party -- the Croatians, who traditionally 
deem the area of the Kupres plain their "own" zone of interest, 
were expected to take a much keener interest in this part of the 
R.S. 
  However, the Moslems too, seem to have become increasingly 
aware that the Kupres pass was of strategic significance as it 
opened the way via Bugojno, Gornji Vakuf, Travnik to the Sava 
River, in which way the Serb territories in the former Yugoslav 
republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia were being divided 
in two, thereby bringing the Serbian people into a position of 
dependence in the future peace talks. 
  Also, the Kupres plain was in the former Yugoslavia one of 
the most favorable areas to execute airdrops, something which at 
this time did not imply much but could be decisive in case of an 
outside intervention. 
  The recent attack only on the Serb positions near Kupres 
seems to be at this time more of a tactical than broader 
significance. This would primarily entail taking possession of 
positions to deploy heavy artillery which would have played a 
significant role supporting attacks on Srbobran (formerly Donji 
Vakuf). 
  Thus, the assessment that one of the attacks by the Moslem 
forces, planned as part of the spring offensive, would be 
directed towards Srbobran and Jajce to form a springboard for 
further "unification" of the territory of the "independent, 
integral and sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina" was borne out. 
  It was indicative that the attack in the Kupres war zone 
occurred at the time of signing of the Moslem-Croatian 
federation pact on Bosnia and its subsequent confederation with 
Croatia. 
  By way of an agreement with the Croats, Moslem leader Alija 
Izetbegovic won the needed political accord to try a 
breakthrough towards those areas which have thus far not been 
given him in the territorial division of interests. Also, a 
significant part of the Moslem forces engaged so far in fighting 
with the Croatian forces was now free to fight the army of the 
Bosnian Serb Republic.

  [Text] Kupres, March 21 (TANJUG)--Moslem forces from 
Bugojno (central Bosnia) continued attacks on Serb positions at 
the Kupres plateau for six days now, using infantry and 
artillery, local Serb military sources said on Monday. In 
these battles, one combatant of the Bosnian Serb Army was 
killed, and two others were lightly wounded. 
  The Kupres plateau is militarily very important, because 
strategically important roads go from the Adriatic coast towards 
central and western Bosnia via this plateau. 
  The issued statement says Serb defenders have so far 
re-gained about 80 percent of the territory which Moslem 
extremists from Bugojno seized few days ago. The Moslem forces 
on Monday attacked the Serb positions between Cajnice, Foca and 
Gorazde (southeast Bosnia) but all attacks have been repelled 
with no losses among the Serb troops, these sources said on 
Monday. 
  The Moslems continued attempting infiltrating terrorist and 
sabotage groups behind the Serb lines. One such group was 
detected Sunday afternoon in the area between Cajnice and 
Gorazde and their attempt was thwarted on time. Another 
terrorist and sabotage group suffered the same fate near Teslic 
(northern Bosnia). 
  In the wider region of Doboj (northern Bosnia), the Moslem 
forces continued with usual provocations. The strongest 
provocations by the Moslem forces were reported near Mt Ozren, 
whereas re-grouping of Moslem forces was observed in the valleys 
of the Rivers Bosna and Spreca.

<F P=106> [Article by D. Vujicic, N. Smiljic: "Dubrave -- A Time Bomb"] </F>
  [Text] Although Scandinavian and French troops have been at 
Dubrave Airport near Tuzla for 10 days now, there is no sign 
that the opening of the airport could occur very soon. There 
are many reasons for this. 
  It is no secret that during the construction of any military 
airport, ways of destroying it if the luck turns are always 
foreseen. In the course of the hysterical campaign for opening 
this airport, the Western media and politicians simply forgot 
this fact and subsequently found themselves in a tight spot. 
  The airport near Tuzla is a time bomb and should not be 
taken 
lightly, recounts Radovan Kecojevic, the former Yugoslav 
People's Army's [JNA] top expert for pyrotechnics and the man 
who mined Tuzla Airport. So far, 14 explosions have 
reverberated on the runways of this airport, while countless 
other highly destructive time bombs remain hidden. Unless the 
explosives at the airport are painstakingly and expertly 
defused, tragedy is unavoidable. This task, providing that the 
JNA submits the plan showing where the mines are on the runways, 
will take several months. 
<H5>  I Did Not Give the Attestation </H5>
  Before the war, Radovan Kecojevic worked as a pyrotechnics 
expert at Dubrave Airport and was head of the team that mined 
the airport's runways. Since he remained in the town after the 
JNA withdrew from Tuzla -- which was taken over by the Muslims 
-- he was pressured by Alija's army to defuse the bombs at the 
airport, or to at least give them "attestation" that the airport 
could be used. Kecojevic says that he did not do so for moral 
reasons, and because he knew that he could not undertake such a 
task without expert and thorough preparation. 
  There are 42 storage spaces housing explosives under runway 
number 1. All these places have been masked and hidden, says 
Kecojevic. Even if the UN troops were to find the so-called 
"Finnish highly explosive shells" ["finski fugasi"], they would 
have trouble defusing them because of the different ways in 
which these highly explosive shells are activated. 
  Kecojevic explained how every army takes care to maintain 
variety when mining its military airports in order to surprise 
the enemy if he manages to capture the air base. Our collocutor 
also stressed that the JNA devoted a lot of attention to this 
problem. The airport near Tuzla was mined in several different 
ways, and a combination of various detonators was used. 
  Some of the storage spaces for explosives at Dubrave Airport 
have electric detonators, says Kecojevic. It is possible to 
blow up these storage spaces from a greater or smaller distance 
with the help of thin electric cables, with immense consequences 
for the manpower and aircraft at the airport. 
<H5>  The Detonators </H5>
  However, the highly explosive shells with mechanical 
detonators, chemical detonators, and those with a combination of 
the two present the greatest danger, claims this top 
pyrotechnics expert. Nor, indeed, should we exclude the highly 
explosive shells that can be remotely activated with radio waves. 
  The mechanical detonators of the highly explosive shells 
react to vibrations of the ground and shocks on the runway 
caused by landing aircraft. For example, if a heavy transport 
aircraft were to cause vibrations on the runway, an explosion 
would occur. The same thing can occur with detonators made from 
glass and plastic ampules, which could go off suddenly during 
take-off or landing. 
  There is a great chance of the runway being blown up. I 
witnessed this myself on 24 May 1992, when the Muslims took me 
to the airport in order to inspect its condition, says Kecojevic. 
  Describing what he found at the airport after the JNA left, 
this expert says that the main runway had nine large craters, 7 
meters deep and with a radius of some five to six meters. 
Runway number 1 was unusable, and in November of the same year, 
another five chain explosions occurred, causing similar damage. 
  The situation is somewhat different on the airport's runway 
number 2, situated in Cigulje near Zivinice. It is possible 
that some of the highly explosive shells on this runway have 
been detected and defused. Nevertheless, there were numerous 
storage spaces for explosives on this runway, and it is certain 
that not all have been removed. 
  Radovan Kecojevic does not exclude the possibility of 
Dubrave 
Airport being opened. According to him, this can be done after 
some eight to 10 months of work by pyrotechnics experts and 
engineering units. Since the Muslims did not have such experts, 
and since the UN experts have only just recently arrived at the 
site, they face an enormous task. Before this task is tackled, 
the French legionnaires have to clear the airport's substantial 
surface of infantry antitank mines, which were planted without 
any order.

<F P=106> [S. Kostic report: "Farmers' Apprehensions"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The second springtime sowing under the 
international sanctions has started, with much apprehension 
being felt among the farmers. 
  It seems that the primeval fear of heaven's (dis)favor is 
the 
least present among them, because other hardships accompanying 
their work are as just difficult and dangerous. 
  According to the adopted balance of energy supplies, it is 
necessary to provide around 120,000 metric tons of oil for the 
farming work that should be carried out in the first half of the 
year. In happy times that amount would be no problem. Now, 
because of the unprecedented embargo imposed on Yugoslavia, the 
importation of oil derivatives, except meager amounts through 
the black market, has been made totally impossible, while the 
home manufacturers are hardly capable of meeting one fourth of 
the needs. [passage omitted] 
  When some 400,000 tractors spread out over the 2.5 million 
hectares in late March and early April, any delay in supplying 
them with oil could be fatal, because for farmers time is of the 
essence. There is no second chance for those who miss the best 
time for sowing, provided that the weather is favorable as well. 
  Last fall over 300,000 hectares were sown with wheat. Thanks 
to the mild "poor people's winter," as farmers put it, crops 
have welcomed the first warm days in quite a good condition, but 
now mineral fertilizers are needed to boost nutrition. However, 
it is well-known that there is a shortage of fertilizers. The 
importance of reinforced nutrition is shown by the fact that one 
kilogram of fertilizer quintuples the wheat yield. [passage 
omitted] 
  The sowing of sugar beet is in full swing, but few people 
believe that the 100,000 hectares that farmers are hoping for 
will be sowed with that plant. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Branka Andjelkovic: "A Hand Outstretched to the </F>
Russian Brethren"] 
  [Text] Mirko Marjanovic, general director of the 
export-import firm Progres, who last year was proclaimed to be 
one of the 15 most successful businessmen in Serbia, has been 
named by Slobodan Milosevic to fill the vacant office of Serbian 
prime minister, thereby emerging as the winner of the lottery 
that has been going on in recent days. 
  Although he has not been praised to the skies by the 
government media, as is the custom in such situations, Mr. 
Marjanovic, we have learned, charmed the Serbian president so 
much that in a responsible post like that of Serbian prime 
minister he wanted to see none other than the candidate we have 
mentioned. If Slobodan Milosevic had had his way at once, the 
news that Mirko "Miki" Marjanovic was the choice for new prime 
minister would have been stale by now, at least a month old. But 
it was obviously difficult for the director of Progres to give 
up his old post, where he was now in his fourth term, and, as 
the employees themselves say, even they do not remember when Mr. 
Marjanovic came to that firm as a promising young executive. 
<H5>  Gas </H5>
  In actuality, the director of Progres, contrary to many 
people's impression, has not spent his entire working life in 
that position. He began his brilliant career as an economist in 
his native Knin, where he worked for 12 years in TVIK [Knin 
Screw Factory], climbing to the position of commercial director 
thanks to his zeal and knowledge. 
  But in 1973 he exchanged Knin for Moscow and TVIK for 
Progres. In the years that followed he lived in Russia, where he 
became manager of the Progres representative office, and it is 
assumed that his now-famous "Russian" connections date back even 
to that time. 
  Here is how he described his passion for that country in an 
interview : 
  "A love for Russia was nurtured among the people of Krajina 
and passed down from generation to generation, so that it was 
also a dream of mine to see that country and to work in it." 
  Conceiving that slender thread between the Serbian and 
Russian identity as something very ancient, as general director 
of Progres Mr. Marjanovic built his career after 1970 on that 
cornerstone. When almost all Yugoslav firms began to turn their 
backs on the Russian market as the 1980's were coming to a 
close, he embraced it with still greater fervor, so that in the 
last few years Russian-Serb business collaboration has been 
flying like the wind. 
  Apart from the 1992 signing of what published sources called 
the biggest contract ever between Russia and Serbia, calling for 
commodity trade of $3.5 billion a year, a joint Russian-Serbian 
venture Gastrejding was also formed under the sponsorship of 
Progres and acquired a monopoly over the importing of gas from 
Russia. At that time the total value of that transaction was 
estimated at $180 million in both directions. In late 1993 a 
contract was signed with the Russians for a gas pipeline through 
Bulgaria to southern Serbia which is supposed to bring 
incredible prosperity to the "southern railroad line," and rumor 
has it that Belgrade has been heated this winter with Russian 
gas. 
  All of this is certainly thanks to Marjanovic the 
businessman, "since he is a man in whom the Russian side and the 
government of the Russian Federation place the greatest 
confidence." And the Russians who have confidence in Miki 
Marjanovic are not be underestimated. The list of those who are 
his friends includes Yuriy Brezhnev (Leonid's son), with whom he 
had a wild time drinking French cognac at Crazy Horse in Paris, 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister, and Gennadiy 
Shikin, Russian ambassador in Belgrade, with whom he spent New 
Year's Eve in 1994 in the restaurant Dva Jelena, singing in his 
powerful tenor voice a mixture of old Serbian songs from the 
city and Russian ballads. 
<H5>  Aid </H5>
  When all that is taken into account, it perhaps becomes 
clearer why Marjanovic the businessman is so much in favor with 
the Serbian president. After all, in addition to all those 
transactions known to the public, there have also been those 
others, which are perhaps a guarantee to Serbia that the 
Russians still have a keen interest in them on both the economic 
and political fronts. "After all, everyone who knows Mirko 
Marjanovic says that he makes his biggest moves in such a way 
that few people find out about them." 
  But the successes of Progres and its general director in 
Russia and elsewhere (32 representative offices in the world) do 
not seem to be so applicable on home ground. We have learned 
that 70 percent of the work force of approximately 1,200 are on 
mandatory leave. Malicious tongues would say that in Progres 
there are many people from Krajina to whom Director Marjanovic 
has entrusted good positions within the country and abroad. 
  Someone has called Marjanovic "mother of the Serbian people" 
for all he has done for the Serbs in Bosnia and the krajinas. In 
terms of food, clothing, medicine, and perhaps other things, 
those Serbian lands have received from the director of Progres 
aid valued at $3 billion, "since aid to the needy is our debt 
and our obligation as human beings." 
  Aside from all, Miki Marjanovic is also a distinguished 
sports figure as president of the Partizan Soccer Club since 
1989, and, according to his worshippers, he put that team on a 
sound footing: "Success in competition must be aimed at profit, 
but profit must in turn be used to create a strong team that can 
achieve the greatest success." 
  For all his success and ability, Mr. Marjanovic lives 
modestly in a four-room apartment on Banjica, although, it is 
said of this man "of stature," that a smallish villa is in the 
works and will be built by Progres. 
  In view of this portrait of a business executive, it comes 
as 
a surprise that some of the opposition (the SPO [Serbian Renewal 
Movement] and DSS [Democratic Party of Serbia]) should say that 
they would withhold support from him. This perhaps lends 
credence to the rumors that Milosevic's real candidate is after 
all someone else. But, as Mirko "Miki" Marjanovic once said: "At 
this point we all need to be on the same line, the line of 
Serbia, the line of patriotism in defense of the country and our 
people. And as Dr. Mira Markovic has said: `Even the wolves 
stick together in a blizzard.'"

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Karol Wolf </F>
on 15 March; place not given: "The New Slovak Government Wants 
To Orient Itself Toward the West"] 
  [Excerpts] Yesterday, Josef Moravcik, the new Slovak prime 
minister, granted an interview to MLADA FRONTA DNES, in which he 
described the concept of his government in the coming period, 
stressed the necessity of reviving Czech-Slovak relations, and 
indicated the unequivocal orientation of his country toward the 
West. 
  [Wolf] What steps will the new Slovak Cabinet have to take 
in the economic sphere? 
  [Moravcik] I cannot jump to premature conclusions. The 
government's program statement will provide an answer to this 
question, which is very specific. I realize that we will have 
to adopt certain measures. We will know what are the most 
important ones in about two days. 
  [Wolf] What are you going to do to improve Slovakia's image 
abroad? Specifically, to improve the tense Hungarian-Slovak 
relations? 
  [Moravcik] Regarding our relations with Hungary, I will push 
for signing a basic treaty between Hungary and Slovakia as soon 
as possible, even this year, if possible. This treaty should 
guarantee, among other things, the inviolability of the borders. 
I believe that the new government will be able to establish 
positive relations with foreign countries, particularly with the 
neighboring countries. We are going to lay stress on our 
integration into European economic and security structures, and 
I believe we will be able to convince Europe and the world that 
we are unequivocally heading toward the West. 
  [Wolf] How are you going to proceed in the matters that have 
remained unsolved between the Czech Republic and Slovakia--for 
example, the division of federal property and problems in 
defining the borders? 
  [Moravcik] I discussed these problems with Mr. Klaus and Mr. 
Zieleniec when I was foreign minister. I believe that there is 
a solid basis for our reaching an agreement. 
  [Wolf] Are you going to initiate a meeting with Klaus? 
  [Moravcik] I believe it will be inevitable. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Wolf] How are you going to guarantee the stability of your 
government? 
  [Moravcik] Stability is dependent on the consensus of the 
political parties. Entities that supported the no-confidence 
vote in Prime Minister Meciar are the guarantors of stability. 
  [Wolf] Stability is certainly dependent on the attitude of 
the Hungarian opposition. The Hungarian parties have certain 
demands. Are you able to meet them? 
  [Moravcik] In view of the temporary character of our 
government, we are able to meet only certain conditions. Above 
all, we will respect the Council of Europe resolution, which is 
an obligation that Slovakia has accepted.

  [REPUBLIKA] REPUBLIKA is the only daily that is inconvenient 
for the government. Has the government adopted measures to 
liquidate this daily? 
  [Moravcik] The government does not have the means to 
liquidate dailies. Or does it? The press ought to be 
independent, also economically. I believe that it can fulfill 
its role only when it is independent. 
  [REPUBLIKA] In other words, you have not dealt with the 
liquidation of REPUBLIKA in the government? 
  [Moravcik] No, not yet.

on 16 March. Under the Slovak Constitution, parliamentary 
deputies' mandates are suspended while their holders execute 
government posts. 
  Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 17 March carries a 
650-word report by Marcela Kostalova on the 16 March NRSR 
meeting. The report notes that, during the meeting, five 
members of the outgoing government assumed their seats in the 
NRSR again and were assigned places in NRSR committees. 
According to the report, Vladimir Meciar (Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia, HZDS) and Katarina Tothova (HZDS) will both 
be working on the NRSR Constitutional and Legal Affairs 
Committee, Olga Keltosova (HZDS) on the Health Care and Social 
Affairs Committee, Marian Andel (Slovak National Party, SNS) on 
the Education, Science, and Culture Committee, and Jozef Prokes 
(SNS) on the Privatization Committee. The report also mentions 
that Michal Pridala, who assumed the seat vacated by the 
recently deceased HZDS deputy, Hvezdon Koctuch, was assigned to 
the National Economic and Budget Committee. 
  Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 18 March on pages 1 
and 2 carries a 1,000-word report by Marcela Kostalova on the 17 
March NRSR meeting. According to Kostalova, the meeting

parliament who have become government members. The new deputies 
are: Karol Dubovan (Christian Democratic Movement, KDH), who 
stands in for Julius Brocka, minister of labor, social affairs, 
and the family; Mikulas Danko (KDH), who replaces Mikulas 
Dzurinda, minister of transport, communications, and public 
works; Emil Panci (KDH), in lieu of Ladislav Pittner, minister 
of interior; Juraj Horvath (Party of the Democratic Left, SDL), 
instead of Juraj Hrasko, minister of environment; Alena 
Chlapikova (SDL), instead of Pavol Kanis, minister of defense; 
and Milan Kralik (SDL), instead of Pavol Koncos, minister of 
agriculture.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Pavol Kanis by Gyorgy </F>
Jozsef Farkas in Bratislava; date not given: "We Need 
Predictable Relations"] 
  [Text] Five days after the establishment of the Moravcik 
government, the defense minister will be the first minister to 
travel abroad: Pavol Kanis is making a one-day visit to 
Budapest on 21 March, where he will meet his Hungarian 
counterpart, Lajos Fur. Kanis gave an interview to 
NEPSZABADSAG's Bratislava correspondent on his views on the 
talks. 
  [Farkas] Why is Budapest your first destination in your 
capacity as minister? 
  [Kanis] When I began my office, I decided that I would first 
visit the Visegrad countries, and Hungary first, if for no other 
reason than that Visegrad is here. 
  [Farkas] According to the preliminary statement on your 
visit issued on 18 March, you will discuss the Partnership for 
Peace, among other things. How should we understand this? 
  [Kanis] This is a very important element of my talks with 
all of our neighbors. I would like to learn about their views 
on the NATO Partnership for Peace program and the way they 
interpret the possibilities of cooperation within this. 
Naturally, I will also inform my colleagues--Defense Minister 
Fur first--of our ideas. In my view, the Partnership for Peace 
itself provides a serious opportunity for the Central European 
countries to get closer to the West European security systems. 
However, a more stable inner security in our region--namely, in 
Central Europe--can significantly contribute to this. It is 
definitely worth exchanging our views on this issue. 
  [Farkas] Cooperation between the Hungarian and Slovak armies 
has been fairly good. It can certainly be assessed as better 
than our interstate relations. 
  [Kanis] I am convinced that our states need reliable and 
predictable relations, including the notion of security, and 
this in turn affects relations between the two Armies. 
  Naturally, in today's Europe, the armed forces and the 
issues 
of security policy are strongly related and are organically 
connected to the solution of our region's concrete problems or 
to establishing the conditions for the solutions. 
  [Farkas] In addition to being a minister, your negotiating 
partner is chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the 
leading Hungarian Government party, while you are the first 
deputy chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left. Can this 
obvious contrast cause any difficulties in the military 
cooperation that you describe as good? 
  [Kanis] In my view, this kind of meeting has primarily to be 
determined by professional issues and the discussion of security 
policy. I would add that the quality of our relations should 
not be influenced by what kind of government our countries have 
at a given moment. This can also be applied to the political 
affiliation of the given defense ministers. In this case, we 
cannot think of anything but the fact that we have to do 
everything we can to improve bilateral relations, and this task 
is irrespective of party affiliations. It is known that a broad 
coalition consisting of a number of parties is now in government 
in Slovakia, and we clarify and decide very many issues through 
debates. As for our foreign relations, in my view it is 
favorable that the parties in our government maintain good 
relations with the political forces close to them in several 
neighboring countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Interior Ladislav Pittner, by </F>
Marcela Kostalova; place and date not given: "Ladislav 
Pittner's Dissatisfaction, or Who Has the Archives of the Former 
StB?"] 
  [Text] Attention in the domestic policy sphere is 
currently centered, self-evidently, on the dismissal of Vladimir 
Meciar and the subsequent formation of a new Slovak government. 
Nevertheless, it would be good to realize that there are still 
a number of other problems that require a solution because, in 
the event of a failure to resolve them, they could negatively 
influence the future development of this state. We discussed 
one of these problems with [new Interior Minister] Ladislav 
Pittner (Christian Democratic Movement). 
  [Kostalova] During the discussion of the report on the 
fulfillment of Ministry of Interior duties in the National 
Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] Committee for Petitions, 
Legal Protection, and Security, you raised serious objections to 
the way in which the Ministry contractually dealt with the issue 
of the transfer of archives between the former CSFR and the 
Slovak Republic or, rather, between organizations assigned this 
task. 
  [Pittner] We have learned that the treaty sets a period of 
25 years for the archives' transfer. At the same time, no 
priorities are set in the treaty as to which archives and which 
files will be transferred at which time. For example, it is a 
great disenchantment for me that to this day we have not 
received the personnel files of former StB [State Security 
Corps, communist-era secret service] operatives who were Slovaks 
or who simply worked here on Slovak territory. The explanation 
we were given was that there are too many files and that they 
must be handed over gradually. However, when we receive them 
five, 10, or 25 years from now, they can really serve only 
historians and not the purposes for which we would need to have 
them at home today. 
  [Kostalova] [At the NRSR committee meeting] You also voiced 
dissatisfaction with the solution to problems regarding the 
network of agents. 
  [Pittner] Yes, it is known that, in May or June 1992, 
federal bodies collected all files at district offices of the 
former StB in Slovakia and transferred them to Prague. At the 
same time, the contents of those files had not been put on 
record anywhere. We do not even have the certainty that what 
has now been returned to us--I am not referring to the register 
of files but to the files themselves--is complete. This 
[uncertainty] even raises a number of doubts about what we 
actually have here. And, because we know from all available 
sources of information that the former StB had also provided 
data on its permanent staff and network of agents to foreign 
intelligence services, we do not even have a guarantee that we 
would be able to resist such a risk [of former StB agents being 
approached by foreign intelligence services]. To argue that 
these people would no longer be susceptible to blackmail if the 
screening law were abolished is naive. Even if the screening 
law were to be abolished in the future, they would still be 
assailable, albeit only on a social level. This is another 
shortcoming arising from the fact that the adopted skeleton 
treaty simply does not emphasize certain priorities. These 
should concern, above all, active [zivy] files that are of 
importance to the security of our Republic. 
  [Kostalova] Is there anything that could still be done in 
this matter? 
  [Pittner] At this moment, I can scarcely imagine any more 
effective course of action. I remember, for example, a 
statement by Mr. Mitro, director of the Slovak Information 
Service [SIS], that, when he asked the Czech Ministry of 
Interior, which is responsible for the archive of the former 
Federal Ministry of Interior, that materials regarding a certain 
specific matter be issued to him, he received a negative reply. 
The Czech Interior Ministry justifiedly argued that it is not 
authorized to negotiate with the intelligence services of other 
states. And our ministry, in turn, is bound by the aforesaid 
intergovernmental agreement. 
  [Kostalova] Does this mean that we are powerless? What 
about the NRSR Committee for Petitions, Legal Protection, and 
Security, for example? 
  [Pittner] The Committee is not directly charged with 
intervening in such matters, even though we will naturally 
support everything that might mend the situation. It is 
possible, however, that, after some time, the Czech side will 
come to understand our fears and that the anticipated 
cooperation within the framework of the Visegrad group, in 
particular, will make it change its view of cooperation between 
the appropriate bodies of the Czech Republic and the Slovak 
Republic in this area.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Appeal by the Slovak National Party to the </F>
Citizens of Slovakia"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--In an appeal addressed to the citizens 
of the Slovak Republic through TA SR yesterday, the Slovak 
National Party [SNS] called on the citizens to keep calm and not 
to permit Slovakia to be defamed any further. 
  In its appeal, the SNS draws attention to the "difficult 
situation in which power has been seized by people who brought 
about destabilization and are trying to preserve this situation 
under the slogan of democracy and by inciting provocations." It 
expects a further escalation of the attacks on the Movement for 
a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and the SNS, and, therefore, it 
appeals to citizens not to let themselves be provoked into 
ill-considered actions, the consequence of which might be the 
introduction of a police regime and a ban on national parties. 
  "Let us hold out together. Today's situation in parliament 
does not reflect the will of the population. The SNS, in 
cooperation with the HZDS, avails itself of all political means, 
with your help and by making use of the referendum as the most 
democratic means to get rid of power people who were opposed to 
the independence of the Slovak Republic or who, after losing 
their lucrative posts, have left the political entities that 
deserve the credit for the founding of the Slovak Republic and 
for returning decisionmaking on Slovak causes into Slovak hands."

<F P=106> [Report by "is": "According to Slovak National Bank Data, </F>
Meciar Government's Debt Amounts to 60 Billion"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The foreign currency reserves of the 
Slovak National Bank [NBS], excluding gold reserves, represented 
about $415 million as of 31 December 1993, $405 million as of 9 
March 1994, and $439 million as of 14 March 1994. Slovakia's 
total foreign currency reserves (NBS reserves plus foreign 
exchange assets of commercial banks) reached $1.853 billion by 9 
March. "Both NBS reserves and total foreign currency reserves 
can be considered stable, and, therefore, I see no reason to 
correct the targets of the monetary program for 1994," NBS 
Governor Vladimir Masar said within the framework of a meeting 
of the NBS Banking Council. 
  The external indebtedness of the government sector increased 
from $1.6 billion on 31 March 1993 to $1.9 billion by 31 
December 1993. The overall external indebtedness of the Slovak 
Republic, including the debts of banks and the entrepreneurial 
sphere, increased from $2.35 billion on 31 March 1993 to $3.169 
billion by 31 December 1993. "The NBS has met all of its 
commitments," Vladimir Masar added. The servicing of the Slovak 
Republic's debt, including commitments toward the Czech 
Republic, represents $346 million this year, of which $229 
million is principal and $117 million interest. Asked by SME 
about the situation of the current account of Slovakia's balance 
of payments (account of the trade balance plus account of 
services), NBS Vice Governor Marian Jusko said that the NBS does 
not avail itself of complete data yet. "The likely result is 
indicated by Slovak Statistical Office data about the results of 
our balance of trade in 1993, which ended with a deficit of 26.7 
billion Slovak korunas [Sk]," he noted. The balance on the 
clearing account between the Slovak Republic and the Czech 
Republic reached 114 million European Currency Units [ECU's] in 
the Czech Republic's favor by 15 March, which falls 16 million 
ECU short of the set marginal credit. Hence, there is no 
imminent danger of payment in freely convertible currency for 
reason of exceeding the marginal credit. 
  The state budget deficit reached Sk5.4 billion by 14 March 
1994, and, according to the NBS governor, it "evolved within 
planned limits." Last year's state budget deficit amounted to 
Sk21.5 billion. When we include payments to the Czech Republic 
for exceeding the marginal credit on the clearing account, 
however, the deficit amounted to as much as Sk29 billion. The 
NBS covered the deficit, which, according to Vladimir Masar, 
increased drastically toward the end of the year, by means of a 
direct credit, which led to an inordinate growth of money supply 
and to the threat of inflation growth. Since 1 January, the 
state budget deficit has figured in the "state debt" item, and 
parliament will decide on how it will be covered. The former 
government's debt came close to Sk60 billion, also as a result 
of the inclusion of the state budget deficit for last year. 
  [Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 18 March on page 21 
carries an 800-word interview with Julius Toth, outgoing 
minister of finance, by Igor Zvach. The place and date of the 
interview, in which Toth assesses his 21 months in office, are 
not given. Asked about the development of the state budget this 
year, Toth says: "The latest data suggests that meeting the 
targets of this year's budget is realistic. In March a year 
ago, the deficit stood at Sk11 billion; this year it will not 
exceed Sk3.5 billion. At the same time, we must remember that 
we have already paid Sk3.5 billion to the Czech Republic for 
exceeding the marginal credit [on the clearing account] and that 
we have released more than Sk1.1 billion for the National 
Insurance Company. The development since January therefore 
justifies my optimistic assertion that, given a very rational 
management of resources, it may even be possible to use a 
certain portion of the projected Sk14 billion deficit not for 
patching up holes but for development programs. And, inasmuch 
as the economy has already become stabilized, in my opinion, the 
budget management could end with much better results than in 
1993."]

  [Excerpt] The manner in which Meciar's government carried 
out privatization has been sharply criticized. Our colleague 
Renata Havranova, editor of PRACE daily, has filed this 
telephone despatch from Bratislava: 
  [Havranova] The new finance minister, Rudolf Filkus, spoke 
very critically in an interview today about the privatization 
methods of former Prime Minister Meciar, in particular about the 
practices applied in the period starting on 14 February, when 
efforts to pass a vote of no confidence in Meciar's government 
became obvious in the Slovak parliament. Over two days, Meciar 
managed to sell 30 of the most lucrative Slovak enterprises. All 
of them have gone to his supporters. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by "(lek)": "The Military Institute Did Not Develop </F>
Biological Weapons, Says Propper"] 
  [Text] Hradec Kralove--The former Military Research 
Institute in Techonin in the Orlicke Mountains (now the J.E. 
Purkyne Military Medical Academy Institute of Immunology and 
Microbiology) did not develop in the past, nor is it doing so at 
present, bacteriological weapons. This statement was made 
yesterday by Petr Propper, the institute's former director. 
"The institute dealt exclusively with defense-related 
research," he said. 
  Propper described as false the claim in CESKY DENIK that 
dangerous strains of bacteria and viruses, in whose development 
the Techonin-based research institute was involved, are stored 
in various locations in the Czech Republic. 
  According to Josef Fusek, the rector of the Military Medical 
Academy in Hradec Kralove, no bacterial or viral strains with 
transmuted immunological properties were ever developed at the 
institute. Fusek also denied that cholera, plague, smallpox, 
meningitis, or psittacosis germs would have been stored in the 
institute's laboratory. According to him, the research 
concerned other infectious diseases--for example, tularemia. 
  A commission of experts visited the Techonin institute last 
week, on the order of Defense Minister Antonin Baudys, where it 
carried out an inspection and destroyed the cultures that will 
no longer be used for current research, said Fusek. 
  According to staff from the Charles University Faculty of 
Medicine Institute of Microbiology, strains of all of the 
existing bacteria and viruses, including cholera, plague, 
smallpox, and other diseases, are stored in a number of 
microbiological laboratories. The way they store and dispose of 
them is, of course, subject to the regulations of the World 
Health Organization, which rules out any threat to the 
population. 
  According to its Press Department, the Defense Ministry will 
not respond to the report in CESKY DENIK.

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Benes and Lubor Kohout: "The Viral and </F>
Bacterial Strains Stored in the Central Military Hospital Are 
Destroyed Posthaste"] 
  [Text] In CESKY DENIK on Thursday and Friday [17 and 18 
March], we reported the existence of still-maintained bacterial 
and viral strains developed for use as biological weapons. 
According to the findings by CESKY DENIK reporters, one of the 
banks of these strains was concealed in the Central Military 
Hospital in Prague-Stresovice. 
  Yesterday, Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys called an 
extraordinary news conference; as he phrased it, "just to calm 
down the public." 
  Antonin Baudys declared that he was first informed about the 
existence of the particularly dangerous viruses and bacteria on 
13 February of this year. Subsequently, he received more 
information from various sources on 17 February. On the basis of 
this information, an interdepartmental commission was formed, in 
which Health Ministry experts were also represented. The 
commission, according to Baudys, investigated and assessed the 
situation and also decided to liquidate the biological bank 
quickly because it was "no longer useful." The bacterial and 
viral cultures were also destroyed under extraordinary security 
measures between 24 and 25 February with the knowledge and 
instructions of Defense Minister Antonin Baudys and Army Chief 
of Staff Nekvasil. Furthermore, Baudys said that similar 
measures were also taken in the Techonin Military Research 
Institute at the beginning of March. It was precisely in this 
Institute that, according to CESKY DENIK sources, biological 
weapons for the Warsaw Pact were developed. According to claims 
by the military representatives, however, this bank of 
biological cultures was a commonplace affair, and their 
maintenance did not violate any international treaties. 
  An employee of the Techonin Military Research Institute, 
Ales 
Macela, stated that, in the facility where he works, no viral or 
bacterial strains have been cultivated for use in biological 
warfare. Moreover, he claimed that all documentation about the 
research has remained in Techonin. According to him, the 
research was conducted for defense purposes only. According to 
CESKY DENIK sources, however, the documentation was transferred 
to Prague under extraordinary security measures at the beginning 
of March. 
  Deputy Defense Minister Kalousek said that the Klinlab 
company had leased nonresidential premises in the Central 
Military Hospital building. It was precisely in the 
laboratories operated by this company that the bank of viral and 
bacterial cultures that were quickly destroyed on 25 February 
was stored.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jan Benes: "Illegal Bacteria"] </F>
  [Text] Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Chernobyl enriched the 
world by the knowledge of the appearance of nuclear death. The 
beginning of the nuclear age was announced by an act of war in 
the war that the United States neither began nor provoked. It 
took place at the time when the consequences were not known. 
The Chernobyl accident took place at the time when the 
consequences were known. Nevertheless, our subservient state 
leadership did practically nothing to protect the society 
against the aftermath of this accident. The crime of public 
endangerment, which then took place, has not been punished. 
  A journalist must not swallow any bait, nor can he miss any 
alarming news. The rumors about SS-20 missiles "forgotten" by 
the occupational power [on Czech territory] are among the things 
that simply cannot be missed. That is true despite the fact 
that one must know how to use a flare or a warhead, and an 
explosion accidentally triggered by a layman is less likely than 
by an incompetent manipulation with a hand grenade. 
  The situation was worse when unverifiable rumors referred to 
a warhead with a chemical warfare agent. It was just the more 
"poignant" because both the Soviets and Czechoslovakia once 
promised that they would not keep such warfare agents. 
  Moreover, the treaties in which the USSR and former 
Czechoslovakia vouch that they will not use bacteriological or 
virological weapons would make a respectable library. It is not 
only that they promised not to use the weapons--they actually 
promised not to have them. 
  Of course, some disease cultures, bacteria, and viruses are 
stored and cultivated for scientific reasons, even in the 
civilian sector. There are, however, long series of treaties 
and agreements that specify where and how--under no 
circumstances, however, at a single location or even a single 
country. If they have, for instance, smallpox in Stockholm, they 
do not have typhoid, which in turn is, let us say, in Milan. 
These treaties and agreements are also binding for the Czech 
Republic. 
  Nevertheless, the cultures, and in a form ready for combat 
use, have been and are here. In our Army, completing its 
transformation and under the leadership of a Christian minister, 
who should know something about it? Our top brass, as is well 
known, are founding businesses, consortia, etc. You will find a 
small civilian business under the name of Klinlab also in the 
Central Military Hospital building. Similar cultures were 
brought there from Techonin in eastern Bohemia, where they were 
cultivated for the Warsaw Pact. They are stored in the Central 
Military Hospital contrary to all of the aforementioned 
documentation. It is simply a commonplace company, equipped, 
however, at the expense of the Army--i.e., at the expense of the 
ordinary taxpayer. All of this with the knowledge of the 
reformed General Nekvasil. Even his economic deputy, Kalousek, 
knew about it, because he approved the purchase of the equipment 
for the Klinlab company, which was certainly not cheap. 
  As we have managed to ascertain, the serum banks stored in 
the Military Hospital building contain gel ready for immediate 
use. Hence, a catastrophe can be set off by trickling out small 
pox, bubonic plague, or psitacosis, etc. in the subway, for 
instance. 
  An unintentional release could threaten Prague with at least 
the fate of Sverdlovsk (it is now called Ekaterinburg again), 
where a bacteriological warfare agent was released into the 
ventilation system of the local "pharmaceuticals factory," and, 
subsequently, mysterious epidemics broke out in the city. An 
unknown epidemic pneumonia was the most common cause of death. 
  In the Czech Army, the bacteriological and virological death 
received the mark PTZD [prisne tajne, zvlastni dulezitost]--top 
secret, privileged information. The Central Military Hospital 
in Prague, in the building of which the Klinlab is located, is a 
military zone, where the police has no business. At the same 
time, it is also accessible to hospital visitors on the weekends 
and, of course, to outpatients. This means that it is generally 
accessible. The building itself can even be accessed underground. 
  The building has been visited occasionally by a certain 
Colonel Zaykov and Mr. Frolov. Colonel Zaykov used to be a KGB 
attache, while Mr. Frolov was an adviser at the Foreign Trade 
Ministry. Currently, they both hold valid cards for foreigners 
with permanent residence here and engage in business. How about 
selling these cultures to, let us say, Libya? Let us hope that 
the appropriate authorities will deal with this case in all 
seriousness.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Tom Luke: "Partnership for Peace Is an </F>
Absurdity"] 
  [Text] Henry Kissinger has called the Partnership for 
Peace a "gimmick." Synonyms for this include maneuver, trick, 
device, ploy, strategy, and so on. 
  President Walesa, of all the ruling circles from the 
countries involved, is demanding most emphatically equal 
membership in the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO). Warsaw knows 
from experience that friendly pacts with Russia under any 
Russian Government lead to thralldom. The representatives of 
the other countries, however, act as if they know nothing of 
this risk. 
  The protest from Moscow, shortly after Yeltsin's agreement, 
against its former satellite states becoming affiliated with the 
Alliance was an ominous sign confirming Russia's tendency to 
regard these states as its zone of interest. This is not as 
binding as if Russia were assuming the right to determine what 
place the sovereign states in this geographic zone will hold in 
Europe and the world, as long as they do not cede this right to 
it. It is alarming, however, that the West is practicing a new 
policy of appeasement, called Partnership for Peace, to the 
detriment of the genuine endeavor for an independent democratic 
arrangement in Central Europe. Has nothing been learned from 
Munich and Yalta? In its incorrigible naivete, the West is 
staking everything on the "democrat" Yeltsin, the proponent of a 
market economy, long after he abandoned his former reform allies 
to their fate and began to seek compromises with the 
antidemocratic forces. 
  No normal and sensible person can condone the threat of a 
nuclear conflict. The United States is rightly striving for 
nuclear disarmament, but it is not its job to exert pressure on 
Ukraine to surrender its nuclear weapons to Russia and thus 
clear a corridor for the Russian armies' hypothetical invasion 
of Central Europe. The tactic of "Russia First" is built on sand 
by inexperienced U.S. bureaucrats. After World War II, the 
Russian empire expanded within the limits tolerated by the West. 
Moscow did not dare cross this clearly marked demarcation line 
even when Soviet power was at its height. Following the Soviet 
collapse, there came an unexpected opportunity to extend the 
security arrangement of free states in the opposite direction, 
into a region where a strategic vacuum had evolved. A 
correction to the strategic map of Europe could anyhow only 
involve a minimum number of states--that is, those that embody 
civic maturity, domestic stability, successfully initiated 
economic development, and the will to defend individual freedom, 
and those that have a common border with today's NATO. 
  The vacuum between the power-wielding camps never was viable 
in the long term. The affiliation of certain former satellite 
countries to the Alliance today would provoke protests from 
Moscow but no specific countermeasures because, at the moment, 
Russia is too polarized and weakened. Nevertheless, in a year 
or in a decade, after the installation of the next potential 
totalitarian regime over the masses whipped up by the idea of a 
Greater Russia, which can be envisaged, the West will not risk a 
conflict, even for the geographic expansion of democracy. In 
the event that the economic boom in Russia is unsuccessful and, 
thus, civil discontent increases, the new totalitarian power in 
Moscow will be compelled to conduct an aggressive policy in 
order to divert attention away from the real poverty at home. 
  German strategists have calculated that, if NATO is not 
expanded eastward, the FRG will be the first bastion of defense 
in the event of Russian military aggression against Europe. It 
is possible, therefore, to anticipate that Germany, in its own 
interest, would welcome pushing NATO's borders toward the east. 
The rest of Western Europe is descending into a state of tired 
resignation and inability to defend itself against totalitarian 
aggression. In this century, it was the English-speaking world 
that derived sufficient vitality to defend individual freedom, 
not only by words, as became the habit in the other 
postindustrial democracies, but also by deeds. The situation in 
Russia is far from being clear-cut enough for us to be able to 
tell what combination of communists, ultranationalists, the KGB, 
the Army, and orthodox fundamentalists will prevail and when. 
Therefore, it could lead to a catastrophe if the United States, 
in the role of leading global democracy, were to continue the 
policy of appeasement. The Partnership for Peace is the exact 
opposite of a policy of strength. 
  In an attempt not to provoke Moscow and, at the same time, 
to 
placate the nations that experienced the Russian grasp and are 
monitoring developments in Russia with horror, President Clinton 
is heralding the utopian Partnership for Peace instead of 
security guarantees. "Democracy as far as the Urals" or even 
"Democracy as far as Vladivostok" perhaps exists in Clinton's 
dreams, but it has nothing in common with realistic policy. The 
appeal to all members of the former Soviet empire to join the 
Partnership for Peace predetermines the division of Europe into 
the NATO sphere and also into certain internationally recognized 
neutral countries such as Switzerland, Austria, and Sweden, and, 
finally, into the remaining countries. 
  No claim uttered smilingly to the opposite will change the 
fact that Clinton's naive delusion is actively driving the 
countries that have just gained their independence into an 
arrangement where Russia is assuming supremacy and the right of 
veto. Moreover, this plan, which, despite its name, is 
providing neither peace nor equal partnership, places the new 
democracies, and particularly the Czech Republic, on a par with 
entities that do not have a democratic tradition, do not respect 
human rights, and are socially and economically at the bottom. 
  It is surprising that the Czech Government does not have a 
sufficient quantity of insight and the dynamism not to sign its 
own death warrant in the tradition of its predecessors. 
Rejecting the offensive nonsense called Partnership for Peace 
would be far less dangerous than signing it. This way, Prague 
would retain its freedom to negotiate unilaterally on joining 
NATO or to negotiate on mutual defense with certain select 
states. The Czech Republic's integration into the Western 
community would irritate Moscow, but it would accept it de facto 
because the Republic does not have a common border with the 
former Soviet Union. It is up to the Czech Government to 
persuade the West that, as opposed to the other former communist 
states, the Czech Republic qualifies as an equal partner. As an 
ally, it would be more reliable, more stable, and more 
respectful of human rights on its territory than many a full 
member of the Alliance.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Jiri Pisklak, the Czech </F>
Republic's representative at NATO, by Jaroslav Fiala; place and 
date not given: "The North Atlantic Treaty Is No Warsaw Pact"] 
  [Excerpts] "I was the first military representative of a 
Warsaw Pact country who came to Brussels and began practical 
cooperation. I had to start with very simple matters, such as 
becoming familiar with NATO. We opened the door slowly and 
tried to show the changes that happened in our country and its 
armed forces," says Major General Jiri Pisklak, the Czech 
Republic's representative at NATO. 
  [Fiala] What are the changes you have just mentioned? 
  [Pisklak] The principal changes have been carried out in 
three large stages: In the first, Soviet troops were withdrawn; 
in the second, the Republic was partitioned and, therefore, the 
Army was also divided; and then there is the transformation that 
we are undergoing now. This stage should end by 1996, which 
means that, by then, our Army should be rebuilt into an army of 
a new type similar to the NATO armies. It is my task to work in 
that direction. I am alone here but, actually, I am mediating 
contacts between the Czech Republic's Army, the NATO command 
here in Brussels, and other command posts. This is 
multinational cooperation among NATO's multinational staffs. 
  [Fiala] Have you noticed any progress in that cooperation? 
  [Pisklak] We have made a great deal of progress, about which 
we do not know much in our country. Actually, we are 
participating in the work of all committees in the North 
Atlantic Council for Cooperation, which is a political and 
consultative body in which the overall situation in NATO is 
discussed. The ambassador of the Czech Republic comes here and 
presents our political attitudes, the policy of the Foreign 
Ministry, and so on. I have the opportunity to participate in 
these meetings. Today, we are also participating in the 
creation of the principal documents in the Political Committee. 
We are also cooperating with the Economic Committee. 
  [Pisklak] Under what circumstance was the North Atlantic 
Council established? 
  [Fiala] It has been newly created, and this is why a special 
formula is used in that connection: 16 NATO countries and 22 
countries of this council [sentence as published]. It is a body 
that was established after the political changes in our country 
were made. This body makes it possible for all of the 
countries, including the republics of the former Soviet Union, 
to join the advanced countries of Europe. The members are, for 
example, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, etc. There are also 
Finnish observers. The purpose of the Council is to make it 
possible for all countries to consult the political situation. 
For example, the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and 
weapons of mass destruction is a new topic. Foreign ministers 
also have meetings. It is an important thing that the Council 
has approved a working plan that fixes the spheres of 
cooperation, including the political, economic, scientific, and 
ecological spheres. In this connection, I would like to avoid 
speaking about details because there are some 300 or 400 various 
committees and work groups within NATO. 
  [Pisklak] Can you describe the work of some of the 
committees and evaluate their results? 
  [Fiala] I highly appreciate the results of the Committee for 
the Coordination of the European Airspace. I have to say that 
Europe is saturated with air traffic. We must have a unified 
system of controlling the air traffic, so our countries could 
join and become compatible in that sphere. The Czech Republic 
has made great progress. In Prague, a new center for 
air-traffic control is being built, which is practically 
comparable with the West European standards. We have joined 
such organizations as ARFA [Allied Radio Frequency Agency], 
which deals with the allocation of frequencies, because it is 
known that frequency bands are overcrowded and every country is 
keeping an eye on the frequencies it can get. In the Economic 
Committee, matters related to the conversion of the arms 
industry were widely discussed. 
  Cooperation in the Ecological Committee is developing 
promisingly. This committee is called the Committee for the 
Vision of Modern Society. For us, the most interesting thing 
was the solution to ecological problems, where Charles 
University is involved to a certain extent. The Foreign 
Ministry is participating in all of the said activities as the 
main organizer, and the Defense Ministry and its experts are 
engaged in many matters because these matters belong to the 
sphere of the Defense Ministry's activity. Someone could say 
that ecology does not belong to the sphere of rapprochement with 
NATO. This is not the case, however. For instance, the cleanup 
operation after the Soviet troops had an impact on both the Army 
and civilians. [passage omitted] 
  [Fiala] Do you have an idea how much the compatibility of 
our Army with NATO forces will cost our taxpayers? 
  [Pisklak] For the time being, almost nothing. We will have 
to carry out the transformation of our Army, in any case. 
Transformation is paid for from the state budget. We are 
spending the extra money on the compatibility of our system. 
For the time being, we are not paying anything extra. 
  In the future, when legal technicalities regarding residence 
permits are sorted out, some of our people should come here--not 
as many as from the big countries, however. One or two people 
should remain in Mons, and three to five should be designated 
for direct cooperation here in Brussels. Of course, the cost 
for having officials abroad, costs that are linked to the work 
of those people, are paid from the budget. However, no enormous 
sums will be involved. Through the Partnership for Peace plan, 
we will participate in certain social actions, which will allow 
us to participate in international operations. First, certain 
exercises will be focused on keeping peace, on preparing UN 
joint operations, rescue and humanitarian actions, and others. 
It is normal practice that each NATO country pay for those 
actions. From the existing military budget, we will be unable 
to pay for a large action, and it is expected that we are not 
going to undertake any large actions this year. Later on, we 
are expected to pay for anything that will take place on our 
territory within the Partnership for Peace framework, and we 
will have to pay the bill if we send smaller units abroad for 
exercises. This requires legislative steps, however, because 
these things have to do something with the Constitution, and 
parliament will have to decide them. 
  [Fiala] Could you be more specific about the legislative 
changes? 
  [Pisklak] Every country that will want to become a member 
will have to review its laws and legislative system to find out 
how much their law and legislative system are compatible with 
membership in the Alliance. Their legislative system may 
contain certain laws and stipulations that may prevent these 
countries from fulfilling obligations ensuing from the treaties. 
This mainly applies to the deployment of foreign troops on 
their territory. (I know that we hate listening to those things 
after our 1968 experience). For example, the Belgian Government 
gives special status to people who work on NATO staffs in 
Belgium. This status should apply to our people also. The 
deployment of the troops in Germany is regulated by special 
laws, for example. There is a special law that defines the 
rights and obligations of foreign soldiers participating in 
exercises on the territory of a member country. We will have to 
establish a group of experts who will select, as a reference, a 
NATO country similar to ours and who will deal with these 
matters. We can ask for such help without any problems because 
everyone will be willing to provide it. This is why the 
question of whether to join NATO immediately is not easy. Every 
country must prepare itself in a certain way. It it difficult 
to fix a deadline, for which our people yearn so much. 
  [Fiala] When are we going to become a full Alliance member, 
in your estimate? 
  [Pisklak] In my estimate, this deadline should not extend 
beyond the end of this century because our Republic is certainly 
comparable with some NATO member countries regarding the 
stability of the political system, economic results, the overall 
transformation of our thinking, and our capability to build a 
democratic system. Actually, NATO believes that the democratic 
system and the market economy are shared values. We are 
building this democratic system and market economy, and we need 
to complete them. Our public does not have too detailed 
information on NATO. In general, NATO is believed to be a sort 
of military organization, similar to the Warsaw Pact. NATO, 
however, is not only a military organization.... 
  [Fiala] What factors will most influence the Czech 
Republic's joining NATO? 
  [Pisklak] A composite of all factors at the same time. NATO 
is not only a defense organization but also a political and 
economic organization and an organization that controls 
cooperation in science. The security aspect prevails, of 
course. We should speak about creating a reliable European 
security system in Europe in the future. 
  NATO is undergoing a transformation and is modifying its 
military structure in an important way so as to adjust it as 
much as possible to the new conditions. If the conflict in 
Yugoslavia is ended (which would help improve stability and 
strengthen peace in Europe), I believe that we really will have 
the possibility to create, in a well-conceived and reasonable 
way, a European security system. I am of the opinion that NATO 
has the prerequisites to become the cornerstone of a system on 
which everyone could rely. It can share experience and 
knowledge with others. It would be an ideal solution if we had 
NATO with two, three, or more pillars--a Central European 
pillar, for instance, could be one of them. We should not 
divide our efforts to establish European security. This is my 
personal opinion. 
  [Fiala] What is your view of our Army, from the Brussels 
perspective? 
  [Pisklak] Out Army has undergone significant changes. New 
people assumed positions in all of the important places. Unlike 
the previous people, they are knowledgeable about the world, and 
they have proper educations. Unfortunately, many of them 
complete their educations and leave, which is a very sad fact. 
I believe that, in the new spirit, the Army's task is to defend 
the Czech Republic. I also believe that people who are in the 
Army feel that they are responsible for the defense of the 
country. I believe it is an unfortunate fact that our society 
looks at our Army through the perspective of the past, despite 
the fact that our Army is undergoing an important and painful 
process of transformation. If I am to be sincere, I have to say 
that we were not alone in having been immersed in ourselves for 
those 40 years. In NATO, they have similar problems. They, 
too, have a narrow and maybe even a distorted view of certain 
things. In the process of becoming acquainted with them, we 
have arrived at a surprising conclusion: We are closer to each 
other than we originally thought. We have found out that our 
opinions are quite close, that we have identical views on 
problems of security, education, training, the role of the Army, 
etc. 
  [Fiala] Our Army was a Warsaw Pact member until recently.... 
  [Pisklak] NATO membership leaves complete sovereignty to its 
members. This is quite a different thing from the directive 
manner of control that existed within the Warsaw Pact. It is 
desirable that our society should understand that we have to 
begin building the Army. Time is flying, and, if we want to 
build on the traditions of the first republic, we should support 
the creators of the new Army. We should stop noticing only 
negative aspects and begin noticing that our soldiers are able 
to do something positive. I could give you examples of the 
professionalism of our Army. If someone was able to move 
130,000 Soviet troops in such a short time, and if someone was 
able to divide the Army that had coexisted since 1945 into two 
parts, he must have been a professional; amateurs could not have 
done it. If our soldiers manage to be equal partners to the 
Western soldiers, if they are able to fully integrate themselves 
into the United Nations [troops], our Army is commensurate with 
a number of other armies. We only need to create conditions for 
the people to feel good and to want to serve in the Army. We 
should make the Army attractive to young people.

  [Excerpts] The Prague rally staged by the Czech-Moravian 
Chamber of Trade Unions Association [CMCTUA] is about to end. 
Our correspondent Jiri Bohacek reports: 
  [Bohacek] Pavel Hajek, CMCTUA deputy chairman, addressed the 
rally at noon. The Old Town Square was 75-percent full. Labor 
and Social Affairs Minister Jindrich Vodicka arrived at that 
time, but the trade unionist crowd would not allow Vodicka to 
join them. The speakers asked those present to make room so 
that Mr. Minister could leave. Minister Vodicka was forced to 
leave without being allowed to speak or defend himself. 
According to unconfirmed information, a member of Mr. 
Minister's entourage was injured. [passage omitted] 
  Distributors of leaflets published by the Association for 
the 
Republic appeared among the participants at the rally, but they 
failed to hand out any of their literature. 
  It seems that the rally has just ended. The gathering sang 
the anthem and people are leaving.

Percent, Followed by the Civic Democratic Alliance and the Czech 
Social Democratic Party"] 
  [Text] If elections to the Chamber of Deputies were to be 
held now, the Civic Democratic Party [ODS] would win with 30 
percent of the vote. The second-strongest party would be the 
Civic Democratic Alliance, with 11 percent, and the Czech Social 
Democratic Party would come in third, with 10 percent. This is 
apparent from the results of a poll conducted at the beginning 
of March by the Institute for Public Opinion Research. The 
other parties would not attain the 5-percent limit. The 
Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party and the 
Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia, with 4 percent each, and 
the Left Bloc and the Association for the Republic-Republican 
Party of Czechoslovakia, with 3 percent each, would win the most 
votes of these parties. More than one-quarter of citizens (26 
percent) have still not made up their minds which party they 
would vote for. Only 12 percent of respondents consider the 
newly established Democratic Union to be necessary. Of the 
ODS's current supporters, 21 percent are of the opinion that 
this party is necessary, and 8 percent of them would perhaps 
vote for it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Iwo Byczewski, </F>
Poland's chief negotiator in the Polish-Lithuanian talks leading 
up to the friendship treaty, by Cezary Gmyz; place and date not 
given: "The Treaty Protects Minority Rights in Accordance With 
European Standards"] 
  [Text] [Gmyz] The foreign ministers of Poland and 
Lithuania have concluded a treaty on friendship and 
good-neighborly relations. Why have the contents of this treaty 
not been made public? That does not conform to international 
practice. 
  [Byczewski] Ministers Povilas Gylys and Andrzej Olechowski 
merely initialed the treaty. That merely signifies the formal 
conclusion of the negotiation process. The contents of 
important international documents like this are revealed not 
after they have been initialed but after they have been signed. 
The signing ceremony will probably take place in Vilnius in 
April. The treaty will be signed by the presidents of both 
countries. 
  [Gmyz] Does that mean that the president will ratify the 
treaty without parliament's consent and that it will enter into 
effect immediately after it has been signed in Vilnius? 
  [Byczewski] The ratification and the signing of a treaty are 
two entirely different things. The Small Constitution envisages 
two ways of ratifying international treaties. Treaties that 
alter borders or result in budget spending have to be approved 
by the parliaments of both countries in the form of ratification 
laws before they can be ratified by the politicians. As far as 
lesser treaties are concerned, the president of each country may 
ratify them without the consent of parliament. The treaty with 
Lithuania is, of course, a treaty of great importance, and we 
want it to undergo what we in diplomatic language call major 
ratification--i.e., following parliament's consent. 
  [Gmyz] The greatest problem during the negotiation process 
was presented by history itself--to be more precise, the taking 
of Vilnius by Polish General Zeligowski in 1920. How has this 
problem been resolved? 
  [Byczewski] Treaties are concerned not with the past but 
with the future. For this reason, the Polish side has clearly 
been saying from the very beginning that the treaty cannot 
contain any assessments of history, and it does not contain any. 
The preamble does contain certain standard general references 
to history. Both sides express regret at the conflicts between 
our countries and the use of force that no doubt occurred, but 
no concrete events are mentioned and nothing is evaluated. 
  [Gmyz] Is it true that, in the treaty, we guarantee Vilnius 
as the capital of Lithuania and they guarantee us Warsaw as our 
capital? If so, what would happen if the Lithuanians wanted to 
move their capital elsewhere? Would they require Poland's 
consent? 
  [Byczewski] The preamle mentions both cities as capital 
cities, but the treaty itself contains no guarantees that they 
remain capitals. This is a domestic matter for each country and 
has nothing to do with international documents. The Lithuanians 
have always considered Vilnius their historic capital, and I 
very much doubt if they would ever want to move it somewhere 
else. 
  [Gmyz] How does the treaty address the rights of minorities? 
  [Byczewski] The treaty fully guarantees the rights of 
minorities in accordance with European standards. The press has 
unnecessarily been reporting on the treaty only from the angle 
of history and minority rights. Yet the treaty also addresses 
other important spheres such as cross-border and regional trade. 
After all, it calls for the opening of new border crossings and 
other important matters. 
  [Gmyz] What were the talks like? 
  [Byczewski] I make no secret of the fact that they were hard 
and complicated. There were five rounds of talks. The 
negotiations themselves did not exhaust all issues, of course. 
The ministers mentioned letters about which the general public 
knows nothing. One day these will be interesting documents for 
historians. The informal visits of Lithuanian politicians in 
Poland were also important. First, we hosted Lithuanian 
Parliamentary Speaker Jursenas, who was accompanied by 
Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladislavas Domarkas. Later 
came Prime Minister Adolfas Szelevicius. Polish Minister 
Andrzej Zakrzewksi headed a presidential mission to Lithuania in 
February. The recent telephone conversation between the 
presidents of both countries was also important. 
  [Gmyz] Is the treaty a success of Polish diplomacy, as the 
Lithuanian opposition parties claim it is? 
  [Byczewski] It is the conclusion of the talks and the 
resolution of all thorny issues that constitute a success. It 
is a bilateral success. Of course, there are always specific 
people behind every document. At this point, I must commend my 
colleagues, especially Stefan Meller, who is deputy director of 
Department One, dealing with Europe. He is a historian, and 
there were times when his advice and remarks provided the talks 
with a helpful push. The treaty completes the round of 
international political agreements with our neighbors. Yet we 
did not start until 1989.

  [Text] Warsaw, 21 Mar--President of the Polish Republic 
Lech Walesa has received National Defense Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk. 
  Minister Kolodziejczyk briefed the president on his recent 
visit to Turkey and on a planned visit to the United States and 
Canada, the president's press office reports. 
  Talking about his visit to Turkey, the minister of national 
defense said: "Military diplomacy is going through a period of 
extensive activities. I hope that close technological 
cooperation will follow the visit to Turkey. This is a very 
attractive partner. Within the past 10 years, Turkey has built a 
modern arms industry from scratch. We hope to establish closer 
cooperation with this state. An important element of the 
Turkish visit was also the confirmation of what had been said by 
President Demirel in Warsaw, that Turkey will continue to 
support our integration with the European security structures. 
This was emphasized on many occasions. Here we have a true 
ally." 
  Referring to his visit to the United States and Canada, the 
minister of national defense said: "Our main goal during this 
trip will be to convince the United States to open up wider to 
technological cooperation, and to open up wider to assisting in 
the restructuring of our Army. Similar issues will be raised in 
Canada." 
  President Lech Walesa has approved the program for the 
visit. 
He drew attention to the need to continue what was achieved by 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "We have to do everything to 
ensure that Poland is integrated into the Euro-Atlantic system," 
the president underscored.

<F P=106> [Article by Pawel Reszka: "Government-`Solidarity'; A Week </F>
for Experts"] 
  [Text] Today experts of the government and "Solidarity" 
["S"] are beginning talks. In line with one version (submitted 
by Marian Krzaklewski at a press conference), they are supposed 
to prepare proposals of legal changes that would be needed to 
implement the demands of "S." The team's decisions would then 
be approved by the Council of Ministers at its next session. In 
line with another version (a joint communique by the director of 
the Government Press Office and the "S" spokesman), they are 
supposed to "review the most important problems submitted by 
both parties and propose solutions to them within a week. (...) 
The results of the talks between the prime minister and the 
chairmen of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union `S' and 
other trade unions, just like the results of the work of 
experts, will be presented and discussed at the session of the 
Council of Ministers." 
  "S" says that the failure or success of the talks will 
determine the staging of a mass protest. Until the decisions 
are implemented (that is, as the National 
Committee--KK--spokesman explained to us, until their results 
are approved by the parliament), the union will strike in line 
with the earlier schedule. 
<H5>  What "S" Wants To Achieve </H5>
  "S" is striking to protest the lowering of the living 
standard of the Polish families. The union presented the 
following proposals (in line with the words of the "S" 
spokesman): 
  --slowing down the rate of increase of the energy prices 
("S" 
claims that it has been accepted by the World Bank) 
  --increasing the real wages of the people 
  --implementing the "Pact on Enterprise" 
  --amending the Budget Law (more money for social aid) and 
amending the budget-related laws 
  --collecting income taxes in families (distributing the 
income among all of the family members, including children); in 
families with the lowest incomes (on the border of the 
biological minimum), collecting no tax or lowering the limit 
  --deducting from the tax the costs of commuting to work and 
the costs of educating the children 
  --a five-day workweek and all Saturdays free (so that more 
people can be employed) 
  --giving the national property to all citizens. 
<H5>  Which Laws Need To Be Amended </H5>
  By the end of the week, the "S" experts, along with 
government representatives, want to come up with proposals of 
legal solutions that would make it possible to implement the 
demands. "S" KK Press Spokesman Piotr Zak was not able to tell 
us which laws "S" believes should be amended. 
  "This is what the experts are going to discuss," he 
explained. 
  An analysis of the demands suggests that their 
implementation 
will call for amending the following laws: 
  --the Budget Law 
  --the Law on Income Tax for Persons 
  --the Labor Code 
  and the adoption of a new law on giving the national 
property 
to all citizens. 
<H5>  What Rivals Say to That </H5>
  "As far as I know, the purpose of the talks between the 
government and `S' is the selection of the place to which the 
problems of this trade union will be forwarded. It may be the 
Trilateral Committee or the teams negotiating the Charter of 
Social Guarantees," we learned from Waclaw Martyniuk, deputy 
chairman of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ]. 
Martyniuk informed us that, at the meeting with OPZZ, the prime 
minister stressed that he wants to hold joint negotiations with 
all of the trade unions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Krakow President Jozef Lassota, local </F>
self-government activist and member of the President's Council 
for Local Self-Government Affairs, by Antoni Lewandowski; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] During the meeting between the delegates of 
the Polish Cities Union and local self-government structures and 
President Walesa's representative Professor Lech Falandysz, most 
utterances by the mayors and presidents of Polish cities were 
dominated by a sense of profound disquiet concerning the fate of 
the democratic system based on local self-government structures. 
The absence of any results so far after several months of talks 
by the Commission for Government and Local Self-Government 
Affairs gave another cause for concern. 
  The assembled delegates representing local 
self-government bodies decided to take advantage of President 
Lech Walesa's offer and voted to transform the loose 
representation of local self-government structures (comprising 
36 delegates) into the President's Council for Local 
Self-Government Affairs. 
  In compliance with the president's suggestion, 
communicated to the meeting by Prof. Lech Falandysz, the Council 
elected Professor Maria Gintowt-Jankowicz, director of the 
National School of State Administration, to the office of 
chairman. 
  We asked Krakow President Jozef Lassota, member of the 
new council and local self-government activist, for a general 
assessment of the current situation arising from the 
government's attitude to local self-government structures, a 
situation that was described during the meeting as "a dialogue 
of the deaf." 
  [Lewandowski] How would you comment on the difficulties, 
reported here by delegates, in achieving a measure of agreement 
between local self-government structures and central government? 
  [Lassota] I believe that the government's attitude to local 
self-government structures can be defined today as a trend 
following logically from the government's overall philosophy of 
the methods of state administration. The present government has 
already demonstrated quite clearly that it is opposed to 
decentralization. Instead, it favors centralization of state 
structures. 
  Both Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and Minister Michal 
Strak, head of the Council of Ministers' Office, state 
officially that they are in favor of decentralization of power. 
However, we note that, in practice, they pursue a completely 
different policy. In other words, they say one thing and do 
another. Attempts by self-government bodies to conduct a 
dialogue with the central government are not even like a 
dialogue of the deaf. I would say, quite simply, that we are 
being cheated. I believe that the government does not even try 
to play fair with either local self-government bodies or with 
the public. It is dishonest of the government not to declare 
openly what it really wants to do. 
  I have arrived at this opinion of the state of affairs, 
among 
other things, on the basis of the talks between representatives 
of central government and local self-government structures in 
which I have been taking part. We have not been able to come to 
an understanding for long months now. As far as I am concerned, 
it is quite obvious. We can see from this that we will never 
come to an agreement on any vital issues. 
  [Lewandowski] But surely the Office of the Government 
Plenipotentiary for the Reform of Public Administration is still 
in existence and in operation, is it not? 
  [Lassota] The fact that the function of plenipotentiary 
for the reform of public administration is still extant serves 
only as a smokescreen for the government, designed to suggest 
that something is being done. In truth, the role of the 
government plenipotentiary has been reduced to that of a minor 
official who does not have even the power to bring about the 
realization of the decisions that had already been prepared for 
implementation by the previous government. As far as local 
self-government structures are concerned, this is just another 
fact attesting to the central government's hostility to all 
reforms concerning local self-government. 
  [Lewandowski] How would you evaluate the realization of the 
so-called "pilot program"? 
  [Lassota] All decisions the present government made in 
connection with this program are drastically curtailed in 
relation to the original version and were only made under 
pressure from local self-government bodies and public opinion. 
We began to put the pilot program together in the middle of 
1993. It officially came into effect on 1 January 1994. For 
the past two months, we have encountered nothing but a string of 
official difficulties. Let me give you just one example 
concerning both the financial and legal angles of our 
operations: First of all, we encounter continuous "piling up" 
of difficulties hampering the transfer of funds to projects 
envisaged in the program; in addition, the sources supplying 
finance for the program are regularly blocked. Moreover, to 
date, voivodas have not received appropriate instructions 
concerning the pilot program, and, as a result, they are unsure 
whether they are really supposed to support the pilot program or 
to reject it. Those who have the courage to assist us on their 
own initiative have been doing it regardless of the 
difficulties. Others, though, do not do anything to help us in 
our operations, and, consequently the whole scheme has so far 
reached a deadlock. 
  The above examples demonstrate clearly that the government 
does not intend to accept responsibility for the realization of 
the pilot program. It is possible that this is a deliberate 
"preelection action" designed to undermine the forthcoming local 
self-government election campaign. It may be that, after the 
election, the situation will change, but, knowing the central 
government's general attitude toward these matters, I doubt it 
very much.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrzej Lepper, chairman of Samoobrona </F>
(Self-Defense) Farmers Trade Union, by Ewa Koszur and Andrzej 
Sondej; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [GLOS SZCZECINSKI] What is 
"Lepperism"? 
  [Lepper] Lepperism is certainly neither Stalinism nor 
Hitlerism, nor anything similar to these phenomena. It is a 
movement that arose from the grass roots, from people's sense of 
injustice suffered, a movement that places the human being 
first, as a subject in its own right rather than an object. 
  [GLOS SZCZECINSKI] Do you, too, feel that injustice has been 
done to you? At a meeting with Nowogard farmers, you spoke of 
your debts, which exceed one billion zlotys [Z], and of your 
inability to pay them off because interest payments are accruing 
on them like an avalanche. 
  [Lepper] The reason I became politically active was not 
simply that I had fallen into the debt trap. I carried out an 
in-depth analysis of the situation ensuing from our involvement 
with the World Bank and the IMF. With the very high interest 
rates that have been given us in the form of a diktat, Poland 
has no chance whatsoever to develop in any way. I could have 
sorted out my own affairs a long time ago; I had several offers 
of help. However, I take a wider view of the situation. And I 
have a sense of duty. If I know the truth concerning certain 
World Bank operations and World Bank funds, I am obliged to pass 
it on and make it public. [passage omitted] 
  [GLOS SZCZECINSKI] During the election campaign, everyone in 
Poland listened as you spoke of debts and social injustice, and 
then the promotional campaign advertisements broadcast by the TV 
election studios showed you in a brand new sports Mercedes. 
  [Lepper] I have a 10-year-old Fiat 125, which can be easily 
verified. My house is old and very small--just three tiny 
rooms. One of our colleagues from Warsaw drives a BMW, another 
gave me a lift in his Mercedes to the television interview. 
People in our group own a variety of good cars, but that does 
not automatically mean that Lepper has one, too. 
  [GLOS SZCZECINSKI] You have a 50-hectare farm. Who runs it 
and works on it on a daily basis, inasmuch as you occupy your 
time with political activity and travel around the country a 
great deal? 
  [Lepper] I have an agreement with a group of younger farmers 
who can use my agricultural machinery and equipment and, in 
return, cultivate my land in addition to their own. But my 
yields are now much lower than in the past, when I sometimes 
collected as much as 60-90 hundredweights of wheat grain per 
hectare, working with quite poor--4th-, 5th-, and even 
6th-grade--soils. 
  [GLOS SZCZECINSKI] You told farmers that you are in favor of 
progress but, at the same time, against banks with marble-lined 
halls and computers everywhere. In that case, what do you 
understand by progress? 
  [Lepper] We do need computers in banks, and perhaps we also 
need new banks, but there is one question that still needs 
answering: If those computers and those banks fail to give us 
credits for agricultural production and, as a result, our 
agricultural production begins to decrease, are the computers 
and the new banks really the most important investment at this 
stage of our development? I am in favor of progress. And, if 
we do not have appropriate new technologies ourselves, we 
certainly need to make use of world achievements in that area. 
However, we must not do that at the risk of destroying our own 
achievements in the process. For example, could we not 
concentrate, in state farms being set up in new premises, on 
promoting modern agricultural practices centering on the 
agricultural food-processing industry? Such enterprises would 
represent closed systems, where agricultural raw material would 
be produced, processed, and even sold. This would benefit the 
urban sector as well as the rural community because it would 
significantly shorten the path between producer and consumer. 
  [GLOS SZCZECINSKI] You criticize everyone at your 
meetings: the president, the peasant prime minister, the State 
Treasury Agricultural Property Agency, the banks, the IMF.... 
  [Lepper] If we want to leave the path of our subjection to 
diktat and Poland's dependence on others' decisions, then we 
must be prepared to say "Halt!" in three instances--that is, to 
carry out the banking reform and to invest in production credits 
connected primarily with the construction and agricultural 
sectors. This would, at the same time, solve the unemployment 
problem for us. Of course, we must find the means to carry out 
all these operations. Without money we really will not achieve 
anything at all. This could be in the form of cash or either 
credit cards or checks. 
  [GLOS SZCZECINSKI] But where would we find the funds to back 
these? 
  [Lepper] Data published by the Main Statistical Office 
provide reliable information on the state's assets. From this, 
we could take 10 percent and get going. Money can simply be 
printed. 
  [GLOS SZCZECINSKI] But what about inflation? 
  [Lepper] And how is inflation created now? After all, when 
there is no production, the living standards will fall, too. 
Already there are 40 percent of householders who can no longer 
afford to pay the rent. If this goes on, we will eventually 
fall into such a trap that only 10 percent will be able to pay 
the rent. 
  [GLOS SZCZECINSKI] As we listen to you we are reminded of 
Boleslaw Tejkowski's latest conference. The difference is that 
you do not place the whole blame squarely on the Jews, the 
Americans, and the Germans, but chiefly on the World Bank and 
the IMF. Would you agree if we were to tell you that your views 
are very similar to those proclaimed by the Polish National 
Community? 
  [Lepper] I know the Polish National Community's program, but 
my views are most certainly not convergent with its. The only 
shared trait could be that our groups have arisen out of 
national movements. Ours is also a national movement, but it is 
not chauvinistically so. 
  [GLOS SZCZECINSKI] Like Zhirinovskiy's, or Le Pen's? 
  [Lepper] I recently read Le Pen's Hope, and I 
believe that there is much sense in what he says. I am not an 
anti-Semite, and I have nothing against ethnic minorities in 
Poland, but I keep repeating that Poland should be ruled by 
Poles. 
  [GLOS SZCZECINSKI] We talk about values--what is right and 
what is wrong. But your Samoobrona is assessed in negative 
terms by the majority of the population. 
  [Lepper] That is your own opinion. I believe that our group 
is influencing wider and wider reaches of society. Our next 
congress, which will be held in May of this year, will show how 
many members we have attracted. We had a "blank" in the 
Szczecin region before, but now I find that even here there are 
people who support us. [passage omitted] 
  [GLOS SZCZECINSKI] You are no longer the same Andrzej Lepper 
the peasants' leader that you were three years ago. Instead, 
you have become a politician. It seems that you are losing 
contact with farmers.... 
  [Lepper] When it was necessary for someone to stand at the 
head of the protesters at Lysomice, cut through the haggling and 
get rid of the head of the Regional Agency, I accepted the 
challenge and did all of those things. I have gained a lot of 
experience over the past three years, but I have not changed. I 
am still as radical as I was then. I expect that we will soon 
take over yet another dismantled state farm in your area, in 
Szczecin Voivodship, rather than allow it to go to ruin. 
  [GLOS SZCZECINSKI] Are you planning to use the wheelbarrow 
[reference to trade unions' traditional ritual when deposing 
officials] again? 
  [Lepper] Why should we need a wheelbarrow? The employees of 
the Torun state farms complex have been striking under our 
banners, but there is still work there, and the enterprise 
manager is staying put. The only thing is that the new owner is 
not being allowed on the premises. We will do the same here if 
that is the work force's will. 
  [GLOS SZCZECINSKI] What will Lepper be like in five years' 
time? Will Samoobrona still be around? 
  [Lepper] This is a difficult question, but everything seems 
to indicate that our movement could at a certain moment dominate 
the political scene in Poland. I deeply hope and believe that 
we will in the end reach out to all of the farthest corners of 
Poland. People will come to understand that they must take 
responsibility for their own defense.

  [Text] Warsaw, 22 Mar--Parliamentary democracy and market 
economy are the foundations of the current government program, 
Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak said on 22 March when addressing 
about 200 participants in an international forum in Warsaw that 
had been organized by the FINANCIAL TIMES under the slogan 
"Doing business in Poland." 
  The prime minister emphasized that his government would 
observe discipline in monetary and budget policies and that it 
would continue the privatization process, while also involving 
foreign capital. He pointed out that it was necessary to 
achieve public support for the economic reforms being 
implemented. "We want the reforms to affect not only the elite 
but also the whole of society," he said. 
  Polish President Lech Walesa, in a letter sent to forum 
participants, pointed out that "Poland has a central position 
between the East and the West, the North and the South, and, 
consequently, it must be part of the integrated continent 
because this is in the interest of the whole of Europe. Poland 
is a country of enormous possibilities and a place where good 
business can be done. To place your stakes in Poland means to 
choose success," the president added.

<F P=106> [Article by Piotr Aleksandrowicz: "Business Community Does </F>
Not Approve of Waldemar Pawlak; Social Research Institute for 
RZECZPOSPOLITA; Company Managers Critical, Concerned Over 
Government Policies"] 
  [Text] Just 9 percent of managers of Polish companies 
approve of the way Waldemar Pawlak has been performing as prime 
minister. Fifty-five percent of company owners, managers, 
chairmen, and their deputies do not approve of Pawlak's 
performance, while over one-third has no opinion on the issue. 
The prime minister enjoys only a marginally better approval 
rate from the state-owned sector (12 percent in favor, 49 
percent against), whereas, with regard to the cooperative 
sector, the approval rate is more or less the same as the 
average. Such are the results obtained from a poll conducted in 
February by the Social Research Institute, despite the fact that 
evaluations of the climate for making money are getting better 
and better. 
  The results of this research involving a group of more than 
500 managers of companies, which is another in a series (fourth 
in a row), are clearly different from responses obtained during 
a survey conducted among Poles generally. During a poll of 
citizens at large conducted in mid-February, 36 percent agreed 
with the way the prime minister performs his job, whereas 35 
percent disagreed. In March, the prime minister's approval 
ratings suffered a slight deterioration (33 percent approve, 37 
percent do not), but these results are definitely better than 
those obtained during polls of economic leaders. The prime 
minister's social support basis consists of senior citizens, 
residents of rural areas, farmers, and the least educated 
people. The business community is against him, and so are 
people with higher educations, the young, and city residents. 
<H5>  They Would Prefer Another Prime Minister </H5>
  So it is no wonder that, while responding to another 
question 
of the survey (which is Poland's only representative poll of 
company owners and managers), only between 10 and 20 company 
managers (3.5 percent) said that, in their view, Pawlak would be 
the best prime minister from the standpoint of the entire 
economy and of their respective companies. In February of this 
year, the top consisted of Kwasniewski and Suchocka (each with 
11 percent of the voters) and Balcerowicz (9 percent). Apart 
from them, Pawlak was beaten by Olechowski (7 percent) and 
Borowski and Korwin-Mikke (4 percent each). The current prime 
minister suffered a loss compared with December 1992, when 5 
percent of the polled company managers were in favor of him. 
Olechowski and Balcerowicz clearly suffered their own losses in 
that time period (by a few percentage points); Suchocka suffered 
a minor loss, while Kwasniewski gained the most (a jump from 2 
percent). 
<H5>  Government Is Not Approved, Either </H5>
  The rate of approval, or rather of disapproval, for the 
government is (in the poll of company managers) identically the 
same as for the prime minister (within the statistical 
error)--that is to say, it is also very low. Ten percent of 
company owners, managers, chairmen, and their deputies approve 
of the way the government does its job, whereas 53 percent do 
not approve. In this case, managers of companies in the private 
sector are the most critical, but the differences are minor, and 
they are mostly due to an increased percentage of the undecided 
among managers in the cooperative and state-owned sectors. Also 
in these sectors, it is hard to find signs of approval. 
  It is a characteristic trait that neither Pawlak nor the 
government as a whole is approved of by those managers who voted 
for the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] or the Democratic Left 
Alliance in the September elections. Because there were 
relatively few company managers who voted for the PSL to begin 
with, the margin of error may be slightly higher than usual, but 
there is no doubt that the business community is satisfied 
neither with Pawlak nor with the government. Those managers who 
during the elections voted for the parties currently in power 
are not satisfied, either. At most, there is a somewhat greater 
confusion for that reason among managers who are left-wing, 
compared with the rest of the managerial group. 

<H5>    Economy Opposed to Authorities </H5>
  The question arises: What is the reason for this phenomenon? 
Our research provides plenty of data in that regard, requiring 
thorough analysis--and we will do that. What can be seen 
immediately is the fact that company managers are critical of 
the prime minister and the government, despite a positive 
assessment of the economic climate, generally speaking. 
  Currently, as many as 61 percent of the polled company 
managers think that there is a climate for making money in 
Poland. In June 1993, the proportion was 53 percent, whereas, 
in December 1992, it was 49 percent. The improvement in the 
economic microclimate, which can be seen in forecasts of higher 
sales or higher profitability of the managers' companies, among 
others, is accompanied by current views of worse prospects for 
the entire Polish economy than was the case in the middle of 
last year. So the company managers are most probably convinced 
that their companies will be developing in spite of the 
authorities that are making mistakes and conducting policies not 
conducive to the economy as a whole. 
  There are more reasons to think the proposition is 
true--namely, in response to another question, those polled 
expressed their concern over the government's economic policies 
more often than they did a few months ago (22 percent currently, 
17 percent in June 1993). But, in all fairness, that was not 
the issue that was listed as the most important. More often, 
there was talk about the companies' internal problems, 
inflation, and the changing legal provisions. 
<H5>  Barriers for Development </H5>
  But, with regard to another question, one about what the 
greatest obstacles are to developing businesses, there were 
increases by a few more points regarding the changing legal 
provisions and the high taxes; these, after all, are issues that 
are directly up to the government to decide. 
  They were listed most frequently already in the past, but 
right now the percentage of company owners who complain about 
them reached 70 percent, when it comes to the changing legal 
provisions, and it exceeded 50 percent with regard to tax 
levels. Perhaps it is the wave of changes in legal provisions 
associated with the new team coming to power (these changes were 
partially prepared by the previous government) and more tax 
raises that are the reason for the reluctant attitude toward the 
authorities in power since the fall of last year. 
  We also asked company managers about their approval or 
disapproval regarding a few specific issues relative to the 
economy. Only government measures in issues like privatization 
enjoyed a higher approval rating than a disapproval rating (57 
percent and 34 percent, respectively). Regarding other issues 
that we asked about, lack of approval clearly prevailed. And so 
the ratios of approving managers to disapproving ones, regarding 
government measures, were as follows on the following issues: 
taxes--15 to 79 percent; customs duties and compensatory 
payments--31 to 55 percent; price policies and inflation--18 to 
73 percent; and salary policies--20 to 66 percent. 
<H5>  More Than Just Numbers </H5>
  From the standpoint of election arithmetic, the results of 
the poll are not very significant. In Poland, there are fewer 
economic units (including one-person partnerships) than there 
are agricultural farms, whereas there are slightly over 100,000 
companies employing at least five persons (which is the kind 
included in our poll). Despite that, it is obvious that the 
poll results constitute a serious warning to both the governing 
coalition and the prime minister personally, and that is due to 
the specific position and power enjoyed by entrepreneurs and 
company managers, the economy's leaders. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  The poll was conducted by the Sopot-based Social Research 
Institute between 14 and 26 February, using a sample of 516 
managers (as chiefs or their deputies) in companies employing at 
least five persons. Seventy percent of the respondents were 
managers in charge of privately owned companies, while managers 
in charge of state-owned and cooperative companies constituted 
15 percent each.

<F P=106> ["Full text" of "address to the Bulgarian Socialists," </F>
adopted at a plenum of the Bulgarian Socialist Party held in 
Sofia on 13 March] 
  [Text] The ideological debate within the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] that has been going on for the last four 
years has entered a decisive stage. The discussion of the 
prepared drafts of the program document is an important moment 
in the life of the party, and it must demonstrate the 
irreversibility of the processes of renewal within the BSP. 
  The debate in the runup to the congress is meant to confirm 
the ideological orientation mapped out by the "Manifesto on 
Democratic Socialism" and the "Platform for Further Renewal of 
the BSP" and to substantiate, supplement, and intensify the main 
characteristics of this orientation -- that of a party of 
democratic socialism, forming part of the Bulgarian and world 
Left that is undergoing renewal. 
  The active and intense debate on the submitted draft 
programs 
should provide the answer to some of the key questions in the 
ideological evolution of the BSP, such as: 
  -- the nature of the contemporary world and Bulgarian 
society, the changes that are ensuing in them, and their 
prospects as we approach the 21st century; 
  -- the left alternative as a path for rescuing the country 
from the socioeconomic crisis in the course of the transition to 
a democratic, social state based on the rule of law; 
  -- the BSP's ideological, social, and political identity; 
  -- the changes needed in the BSP's organization and 
statutes; 
and 
  -- the integration of the Bulgarian Socialists in the 
European and world Left. 
  The intensive, in-depth ideological debate will contribute 
to 
understanding and assimilating the new views contained in the 
various program documents and help to bring them to the notice 
of every Socialist and BSP sympathizer. 
  The municipal BSP councils should create the necessary 
conditions for ensuring that the forthcoming discussion is 
methodical and well organized, that the views expressed are 
summarized and disseminated in popular form, and that these 
views are presented in a timely fashion to the BSP Supreme 
Council. What is needed is not that each BSP organization 
should pass a formal vote of approval, but that each 
organization and every Socialist should give their own 
standpoints on the main issues of the ideological debate and the 
ways they are treated in the individual draft program documents. 
Such a standpoint can only be formed by a discussion in depth 
that involves all the party organs, the main and municipal party 
organizations, and every Socialist. 
  The discussion should be an active and critical one, while 
observing the democratic principles established over the past 
four years. The BSP Supreme Council is sure that the discussion 
of the program will proceed in an atmosphere of mutual tolerance 
and forbearance, which will help to develop and enhance internal 
party relations. The discussion and adoption of a new socialist 
program should create conditions for rallying the party and 
strengthening its organizational and political unity. 
  In the course of the discussion new ideas should be 
generated 
to enhance a future BSP program document. We call upon all the 
teams of authors to present their own draft documents before the 
accountability-election campaign enters its final phase, that 
is, before the municipal organizations hold their conferences. 
As the campaign proceeds, their participation through the 
submission of their drafts will enhance the debate and improve 
the resolutions of the meetings and conferences, promote a 
meaningful elucidation of the problems prior to the 41st 
congress, and considerably facilitate the work of the congress 
itself. 
  We hope that we will succeed in mobilizing the BSP's 
political and scientific potential in the time remaining before 
the upcoming congress. The discussion of the program document 
is a good occasion to motivate the organizations, stimulate the 
ideological trends, and encourage the clubs of socialist 
intellectuals to involve themselves in a public dialogue 
encompassing the entire spectrum of left-wing intellectual 
thinking. 
  The success of the debate on the program is unthinkable 
unless a permanent and authoritative speaker's platform is made 
available. It is essential to ensure greater commitment of the 
party publications to this goal, especially DUMA and NOVO VREME, 
so that they reflect in suitable form the views, remarks, and 
proposals of the participants in the debate. 
  We should not limit the debate to the party organizations. 
The discussion of the ideological problems are a good 
opportunity to open up the Bulgarian Socialists to Bulgarian 
society, the European Left, and the world at large. We should 
seek a broad public debate on the way out of the crisis and the 
problems of the transition to a democratic, social state based 
on the rule of law, a debate that will establish the image of 
the BSP as a fundamental constructive factor in Bulgaria's 
political life. 
  Such a debate will enable the 41st BSP Congress to make a 
comprehensive, in-depth assessment of the results of the 
ideological discussion within the BSP and to impart a new 
impetus to the party's efforts to confirm its program, the 
result of which is of immense importance not only for the 
Socialists themselves, but also for the Bulgarian Left and the 
whole of Bulgarian society.

  [Text] Vienna, March 22 (AFP) -- The International Helsinki 
Federation has criticised Croatia for not living up to human 
rights promises and allowing the violent expulsion of minority 
Serbs from state housing. More than 5,000 people were thrown out 
of their homes illegally by Croatian security forces during 1992 
and 1993, many of them beaten, threatened and robbed in the 
process, it said in a report released Tuesday [22 March]. 
"Despite assurances (...) forced and illegal expulsions, acts of 
violence and the absence of all protection for their victims 
continues in Croatia," it commented. 
  The report gave details of 21 cases, including one where the 
victim died, and criticised Croatia for not keeping a promise 
made in December to open inquiries on the many complaints 
brought to the authorities. The victims were Croat citizens or 
long-standing residents of non-Croat origin, mostly Serb, who 
lived in homes built by the former federal Yugoslav army for 
veterans and their families. 
  Since Croatian independence in 1991, the homes have been 
under the control of the Ministry of Defence.

  [Excerpt] Brussels, March 21 (AFP) -- NATO Monday [21 
March] demanded that Bosnian Serbs relinquish heavy weapons 
found inside the exclusion zone around Sarajevo or face 
airstrikes. 
  UN peacekeepers Sunday [20 March] discovered Serb tanks and 
other heavy armament within the 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion 
zone imposed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization around 
the Bosnian capital last month. 
  A NATO spokesman said that the United Nations Protection 
Force [UNPROFOR] was involved in negotiations with the Serbs to 
settle the issue. 
  "We expect these weapons to be put under UNPROFOR control 
immediately as has been the case with other weapons in the 
exclusion zone," the spokesman said, adding: "Uncontrolled heavy 
weapons within the exclusion zone remain subject to NATO 
airstrikes in accordance with NATO's February 9 decision." 
  On that day NATO issued an ultimatum threatening airstrikes 
if the parties to the conflict -- Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian 
Government forces -- did not withdraw their heavy weapons from 
around Sarajevo or put them under UN control. 
  UNPROFOR said Sunday's discovery of four tanks, three 
anti-aircraft guns, four 105mm howitzer and 18 mortars was a 
"big violation" of the UN demilitarization plan. [passage

  [Text] Members of the government and representatives of 
coalition political entities met at the Slovak Government office 
in Bratislava this afternoon. The session was chaired by Prime 
Minister Jozef Moravcik. The talks resulted in the signing of a 
coalition agreement between the Party of the Democratic Left, 
the Christian Democratic Movement, and the so-called Centrist 
Bloc. 
  Immediately after the agreement was signed, Ivan Bielko 
interviewed Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac. 
  [begin recording] [Kovac] The coalition agreement makes 
possible the functioning of the coalition government and its 
lasting support in parliament for the measures it takes to lead 
this society toward early democratic elections. A lot of work 
will have to be done, naturally. The state cannot come to a 
halt, and the coalition agreement safeguards the mechanisms to 
enable the coalition parties to achieve constructive cooperation. 
  [Bielko] This coalition agreement was signed by five 
entities. What will happen if one of them does not agree? How 
will decisions be adopted? 
  [Kovac] It has been defined that these decisions must be 
adopted by a consensus of all parties. That means that 
disagreement of one party is being replaced by a dialogue. 
Explanations and, truly, the problems that have to be tackled 
must be solved by consensus. No system of voting has been 
introduced. It would not be very good. We will re-assess the 
entire situation. In case there is a negative attitude, we will 
convene an extraordinary coalition council in order to solve the 
problems. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Benes and Lubor Kohout: "A Crime </F>
Endangering Central Europe!"] 
  [Text] One of the places where, until recently, our Army 
concealed very dangerous bacteriological and virological weapons 
was the Central Military Hospital in Prague-Stresovice! 
  CESKY DENIK reporters have discovered that strains for 
bacteriological weapons were stored, without expert supervision 
and the necessary caution, in a laboratory leased to a private 
company on the grounds of the Central Military Hospital in 
Stresovice. They were developed on the basis of a former Warsaw 
Pact treaty in a research institute in Techonin in East Bohemia. 
The laboratory, with its containers full of cultures for 
dangerous infectious germs prepared for combat use, was leased 
to the private Klinlab company. According to the information 
available, Deputy Defense Minister Engineer Miroslav Kalousek 
was involved in establishing this company and in leasing part of 
the Central Military Hospital, including the facility used by 
this company. The Defense Ministry also purchased expensive 
laboratory equipment for the Klinlab company. The whole project 
was described as top secret and of special significance. 
  Some of the containers in which various kinds of bacteria 
for 
weapons "cultivated" by Czechoslovak military experts were 
stored were sold into private hands--that is, to the Klinlab 
company. 
  Bacteriological and viral weapons are among the most 
insidious and dangerous. International agreements commit the 
Czech Republic to preventing their use, development, and 
storage. It is apparent from the findings of the CESKY DENIK 
reporters that the cultures for the bacteriological weapons were 
stored in the Central Military Hospital with the knowledge of 
some of our most senior military representatives.

  [Text] Prague, March 22 (CTK) -- Chairman of the 
government coalition Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) Jan Kalvoda 
expressed his support for a proposal by the coalition leader 
Civic Democratic Party (ODS) to terminate the restitution 
process through a relevant law, the Czech daily RUDE PRAVO 
reports today. 
  At its session in Spindleruv Mlyn, east Bohemia, the ODS 
Executive Council decided to work out a "post-transformation" 
bill aimed at the regulation and termination of the restitution 
and compensation process in the Czech Republic. 
  The left-leaning paper quotes Kalvoda as saying on his 
return 
from a Latin American trip on Monday: "If it (the bill) is a 
broad agreement on terminating restitution and settling 
controversial questions between coalition parties, then I 
support it strongly, in a general sense." 
  At the same time, Kalvoda noted that it was the ODA which 
had 
already pronounced the words "the final point of restitution" a 
few months ago. 
  RUDE PRAVO also quotes Josef Lux, chairman of another 
government coalition party, the Christian Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), as saying at a 
press conference on Monday [21 March] that his party, along with 
the ODA and the last coalition member, the Christian Democratic 
Party (KDS), clearly defined and presented the idea of 
concluding restitution some time ago. In view of this, Lux 
welcomes the Saturday [19 March] resolution by the ODS Executive 
Council to work out legislation on the issue. 
  However, Lux admitted that the stances of the ODS and the 
KDU-CSL on the conclusion of restitution may differ, the daily 
writes. Lux confirmed that within a week, the cabinet, where he 
holds the post of agriculture minister, should discuss the 
KDU-CSL proposal that the government decide on the transfer of 
state property to churches and religious communities. 
  Reacting to a remark by RUDE PRAVO that the ODS seems to 
have 
a negative stance towards this question, Lux responded that only 
the vote in the government would be decisive. He would not 
raise such a proposal if he saw no chance for its passage, he 
said. 
  At the close of the report, RUDE PRAVO quotes KDS Chairman 
Ivan Pilip as saying to CTK on Monday that the ODS's views are 
becoming closer to the views of the KDS.

<F P=106> [Article by Richard Byrne Reilly: "Freedom May Be Driving </F>
People To Drink"] 
  [Text] Experts are alarmed at the sharp rise in alcohol 
consumption--and its twin sister, alcoholism--among Czechs since 
1989. 
  According to a report released by the Prague Psychiatric 
Center in Bohnice, the use of alcohol increased dramatically 
between 1989 and 1992. 
  The consumption of pure alcohol--generally drunk in the form 
of beer and spirits in the Czech Republic--has climbed by 
approximately one liter per capita per year, reaching a total of 
9.4 liters per person in 1992. (Pure-alcohol consumption is 
measured in part so that different nations' statistics can be 
compared directly, whether the local drink of choice is beer, 
wine or some other beverage.) 
  Statistics are still being compiled for 1993. 
  The report noted that consumption levels in Slovakia, 
Hungary 
and Poland all mirrored the post-communist trend in the Czech 
Republic. 
  The consequences of the increase in alcohol consumption and 
abuse are graphically illustrated by the growing number of 
crimes committed under alcohol's influence, by those seeking 
counseling, and also by the great increase in alcohol-related 
traffic fatalities, said Dr. Karel Nespor of the Prague 
Psychiatric Hospital, a co-author of the report. 
  "The decrease in stability of Czech society and the increase 
of the supply and availability of alcohol are two of the main 
factors [for the increase in alcohol consumption]," said Nespor, 
who is also a member of the National Center for Health 
Promotion, and has written extensively on the subject. 
  "For the average Czech citizen, the situation under 
communism 
was more or less predictable," he said. "The sociopolitical 
changes that occurred with the revolution in 1989 have created 
social instability as many people, uncertain as to what the 
future will bring, have turned to drinking in order to cope." 
  He added, "The growing trend is also a product of the abuse 
of freedom. And for many people, it has been difficult to 
adjust." 
  According to a source at the Ministry of Health, 
alcohol-related injuries actually doubled between 1989 and 1993. 
There were 4,500 alcohol-related deaths in the Czech Republic 
last year, the source said. 
  Dr. Vladislav Cerny, a psychologist specializing in the 
study 
of epidemiology at the Prague Psychiatric Center, agreed with 
Nespor's assessment. 
  "One of the main factors related to the rise of alcohol 
consumption is the release of social controls," he said, 
referring to changes that ensued with the demise of the 
one-party communist government. "And the other factor is that 
it's associated with the values of our society, specifically 
Czech culture." 
  Cerny pointed out that consuming alcohol is a renowned Czech 
tradition. Many Czechs use pubs and other alcohol-vending 
establishments as venues for socializing with friends and 
family. Some Czechs, Cerny noted, pride themselves on being able 
to imbibe large quantities. 
  "Many Czechs have a traditionally high tolerance as far as 
the overconsumption of alcohol is concerned," he said. 
  The report, citing information published in the "Czech and 
Slovak Statistical Yearbook," disclosed that Slovakia 
outdistanced the Czech Republic in overall consumption by about 
20 percent. Slovakia, which garnered the distinction of having 
one of the highest-alcohol-consuming populaces in Central 
Europe, registered a per-capita pure-alcohol consumption level 
of 14.2 liters per person, mostly in the form of distilled 
spirits. 
  The report also chronicled a very high number of 
alcohol-related psychoses among Slovak males. And the Slovak 
mortality due to cirrhosis of the liver was shown to be one of 
the highest in Europe. 
  The concept of seeking treatment and the availability of 
information pertaining to alcohol abuse are relatively new 
phenomena in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Under the 
Czechoslovak communist regime, information was tightly 
controlled and the population largely kept in the dark about the 
fact that alcohol abuse could be treated medically. 
  Consequently, many people with alcohol problems continue to 
shun treatment for fear of being ostracized or appearing weak, 
said Nespor. 
  Long a critic of the advertising onslaught from Czech 
breweries, Nespor emphasized the importance of curtailing 
alcohol promotions. He said advertisements have a negative 
influence on a large segment of the Czech population, especially 
the young, who are attracted to ads portraying drinking as 
glamorous and who have no idea they're being targeted by 
corporations. 
  Cerny, when asked what can be done to reverse the alarming 
trend of overconsumption, said education and access to 
information on the adverse effects of alcohol would be one 
solution. But the real responsibility, he claimed, lies with 
politicians. 
  "I think it's time that legislators, or those within the 
sphere of decision making, start showing more concern."

<F P=106> [Article by Brendan McNally: "Passive-Aggressive Tamara: </F>
Tesla's `Stealthy' Radar That Could Revolutionize War-Making"] 
  [Text] In early 1992, members of the old federal parliament 
were amazed to hear senior military officer Oldrich Barak 
announce that the Czechoslovak army had a "stealth radar" called 
Tamara that had already demonstrated its ability to detect and 
identify the U.S. Air Force's multi-billion-dollar B-2 "Stealth" 
bomber. 
  Tamara surfaced again last summer when the Czech government, 
bowing to Western pressure, quashed an attempt to sell six 
Tamara systems to Iran. Since then, Tamara has rapidly become 
one of the Czech Republic's best-known pieces of military 
technology. 
  Despite being dubbed the "stealth radar," Tamara is in fact 
not even a radar. Radar systems "see" by actively bouncing radio 
waves off objects, while Tamara is a purely passive system that 
detects the radiation and electronic signals inevitably emitted 
by even the stealthiest aircraft. 
  "If a B-2 bomber uses even its altimeter, we'll see them," 
Barak said. 
  The ability to detect supposedly invisible aircraft like the 
B-2 sparks the popular imagination. But, for defense experts, 
Tamara's ability to "see without being seen" is a much more 
important quality. In the radar-dominated "electronic 
battlefield" that has existed since World War II, the ability to 
see has invariably meant being seen as well. 
  As a non-radiating passive surveillance system, Tamara has 
effectively broken away from this structure. As a result, some 
believe it could radically alter the balance of modern 
conventional warfare. 
  For this reason, some consider Tamara a potentially 
revolutionary "weapon." 
  Tamara uses artificial intelligence to correlate and 
evaluate 
information. It can even "teach itself" to discern new patterns 
and identify new targets, according to Barak. 
  When discussing Tamara, Barak likes to stress its 
non-military applications. Because the system does not radiate 
energy, Barak said Tamara could be an alternative to airport 
radars in residential areas, where radar saturation could pose 
health risks. Tamara could also be useful in monitoring coastal 
shipping routes such as the English Channel or the North Sea 
coast. 
  Tesla Pardubice began developing passive Electronic 
Intelligence--or ELINT--systems during the late 1960s with an 
experimental system called Kopac. This was followed in the late 
1970s by the second-generation system Ramona, at least one of 
which was sold to Syria. Tamara was developed during the late 
'80s. 
  Only a few Tamaras have actually been sold abroad, Barak 
said. "There are 15 sets within Russia [and] some in the Czech 
and Slovak republics. The German Bundeswehr (federal army) has 
one Tamara and one Ramona." 
  Barak said that attempts to sell Tamara to Iran began before 
he assumed his post. "We haven't had any discussions with Iran 
[since that time]," he said. "We cannot sell Tamara without the 
permission of the government." 
  To sell Tamara to Western militaries, Barak said he knows 
he'll have to break through both the West's prejudice against 
Eastern-bloc hardware and a more powerful prejudice known as the 
"NIH syndrome," which applies to products "not invented here." 
  Does Barak dream of the day when Tamara is part of the 
Pentagon's arsenal? Yes. 
  But, he said, "There is one already in the U.S. somewhere. 
It 
was bought from another country. I don't know from where."

<F P=106> [Article by Andrew Hawker: "Fingers Pointed in Silesia"] </F>
  [Text] In the ecologically and economically blighted region 
of Silesia--weighed down by outdated heavy industry, houses 
heated by coal, and a lack of funds--many prefer not to even 
address the issue of the environment. Others, however, have 
chosen an ambitious answer to what sometimes seems an 
overwhelming problem. 
  With producers in the area clamoring for subsidized 
environmental restructuring loans, those providing funding want 
to know where each dollar will have the greatest impact. Their 
tool is Project Silesia, an international study bringing 
together the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the World 
Bank, the U.S. Peace Corps and the Czech and Polish 
environmental ministries. The study seeks to set priorities for 
the region around Ostrava, northern Moravia, and Katowice, 
southern Poland. 
  The EPA researchers found that air pollutants will probably 
cause cancer in 1.4 percent of the region's 5 million 
inhabitants. In areas with peak concentrations of toxins, more 
than half the residents could be afflicted. On the Czech side of 
the border alone, air-borne dust, sulfur dioxide and other 
atmospheric pollutants are estimated to kill 380 people annually. 
  Cases of breathing paralysis and inflammations are also 
common. Almost 1,000 miners annually suffer from traumas caused 
by silicosis and physical stress. 
  The researchers also found high levels of poisonous 
elements, 
including PCBs, in food produced in Silesia and dangerous levels 
of arsenic in the tap water. 
  In response, Project Silesia's first task was to identify 
the 
main culprits. In this coal-mining and steel-producing region, 
the ax fell heavily on coke ovens. 
  Ostrava-Karvina Coke Ovens (OKK) released 3,800 tons of 
pollutants into the atmosphere last year. Under pressure to cut 
pollution, the company has reduced its production by one-third 
since 1990. 
  OKK's manager, Vitezslav Hladik, hopes to export his 
product, 
which is used to fire metallurgical and power plant furnaces. 
Environmentalists, however, would rather see his ovens 
completely shut down in the near future. 
  "Exporting coke would be selling off our health, and 
depriving ourselves of a non-renewable resource," said Project 
Silesia's Czech coordinator, Helena Cizkova. 
  Like Hladik, other industrial chiefs both fear the project 
and place their bets on it. The study's results will aid in 
directing World Bank funds. 
  Still, "my biggest problem was `selling' the project," 
Cizkova said. "Many other studies are just gathering dust on 
ministerial shelves." 
  Industry scientists typically state that they do not need 
expensive foreign auditors to tell them where their pollution is 
coming from. "We know our problems very well. Ninety percent of 
them we know how to deal with," said Jan Chovanec, a technical 
development worker at Nova Hut, the largest Czech steel producer. 
  Metallurgical plants, which the project identified as the 
second-worst cause of pollution, want money, not advice. 
"Repairs and technological updating will cost us 20 billion Kc 
($6.7 million)," Chovanec said. "We need long-term loans." Nova 
Hut registered 1.9 billion Kc in profits last year. 
  The state has divested itself of its responsibility toward 
the companies, Chovanec said. 
  Nova Hut's ailing Ostrava competitor, Vitkovice, has similar 
complaints. "The Ministry [of Environment] has decided: 
polluter, payer. But if we pay huge fees, we have nothing left 
to make ecological investments," said Vaclav Hettenberger, head 
of Vitkovice's environmental department. In 1993, the firm was 
charged 120 million Kc for improper waste storage alone. 
  Industries point an accusing finger at overly stringent 
green 
regulations, saying that environmental protection laws passed by 
the Czech legislature after the revolution did not take into 
consideration the capacity of producers to adapt. 
  "Our technology is 20 years out of date. And now we are 
suddenly expected to catch up with the European Community by 
1997," Chovanec said. 
  Project manager Cizkova, who is also an employee of the 
Ministry of Environment, says the laws and fees are necessary to 
coax industries into action. "Companies are interested in 
ecology when legislation forces them to be," she said. In fact, 
the fees are so low that it profits the companies to put off 
their clean-up investments, Cizkova said. 
  She agreed, however, that polluters mainly need help and 
money to restructure. "Local loans are too expensive, and 
foreign banks want a go-ahead from well-known international 
consultants. Yet cheaper local technicians can do the job," she 
said. 
  The EPA served mainly to put a prestigious label on the 
project, thus attracting foreign creditors, Cizkova said. 
  The American agency also brought in new working principles. 
"The Czechs have been used to throwing money at problems for 40 
years. The whole idea of risk prioritization is rather new to 
them," said Frank Wheeler of Hatch Associates, an engineering 
and management consulting firm. 
  "When Project Silesia auditors first visited a company, the 
management would first always give them a shopping list," 
Wheeler explained. There was little attempt to assess the best 
destination for the limited funds. 
  The question is now whether Project Silesia's specific 
proposals, expected later this year, will be heeded.

"Privatization of Utilities Loses Steam Amid Dispute"] 
  [Text] The growing dispute over the future of the Czech 
energy network has raised doubts about the effectiveness of the 
government's energy privatization policy. 
  Officials within the Ministry of Privatization and the 
Ministry of Trade and Industry admit there has been poor 
communication and a lack of coordination over the future of 
energy regulations and management. 
  Milan Cerny, deputy energy minister at the Ministry of Trade 
and Industry, admitted that misunderstandings have arisen 
between the ministries. 
  Jan Maixner, a director at the Ministry of Privatization, 
said his ministry should have been better prepared for the 
energy privatization process. "If you take your time and you 
think about it [privatization], you lose that time and you're 
screwed. We thought it was better to move fast. If you do it 
fast, you might make some mistakes," said Maixner, saying he was 
speaking from a "philosophical" point of view. "Maybe we should 
have privatized energy within one wave." 
  At the center of the dispute is future access to the 
republic's energy transmission grid. The network transmits 
energy from the source to eight distribution centers. At 
present, the utility giant CEZ, which was privatized during the 
first wave and is now 70 percent controlled by the National 
Property Fund (FNM), has a monopoly. 
  Meanwhile, officials within the FNM and the Ministry of 
Privatization want to open the energy market to foreign 
competition, thus granting access to the transmission network. 
Distribution centers, to be privatized during the second wave, 
would then be able to purchase power from the cheapest utility. 
  But there is little agreement among CEZ officials, the 
government or the distribution centers as to the effect the open 
network will have on energy service. 
  "We are convinced that if the whole transmission system is 
separated from CEZ, it will be more expensive for everybody, 
especially for the customer at the end of the chain," said 
spokesman Miroslav Novak. 
  The utility will have to act as an energy guarantor for 
foreign energy producers wishing to use the network, Novak said. 
Costs will increase because CEZ will be on continual standby in 
the event of an emergency. As a result, consumers can anticipate 
an estimated 30 percent increase in their energy bill, he said. 
  Without a transmission monopoly, CEZ will also be less 
attractive to foreign investors, he said. 
  Worst of all, there are no regulations concerning foreign 
energy sources--energy legislation is still under debate and is 
not expected to be passed by parliament until later this year. 
The current law makes no mention of foreign competition, Novak 
said. 
  "There have to be certain rules for everybody. It is 
impossible for CEZ to compete with everybody," Novak said. 
  The FNM, however, has offered some relief, he said. The fund 
has guaranteed the transmission network will stay under CEZ's 
control for the next three to four years. 
  But the Ministry of Privatization disputes the results of 
the 
transmission separation and CEZ's time frame. 
  "The transmission network should be taken out of [CEZ's 
hands] and it should be accessible to all countries entering the 
energy market," said Maixner, adding that the FNM will first 
sell off its 70 percent share in the utility and then separate 
the transmission network, perhaps as soon as 1996. Only then 
will regulations regarding foreign energy use be finalized, he 
said. 
  When told that CEZ believes energy costs will rise if it 
loses its monopoly. Maixner said: "Why? They will all be paying 
less. If the distribution companies are independent and foreign 
capital is in the companies, it should lead to lower prices for 
energy." 
  But the head of the Prazska Energetika distribution company, 
which supplies Prague's electricity and buys most of its energy 
from CEZ, isn't sure costs will fall. 
  "[Factories and industry] will have cheaper electricity, but 
it's difficult to ensure the same for the small customers," said 
Prazska Energetika Director Milan Kanda. 
  Prazska Energetika, along with its seven Czech counterparts, 
is busy courting foreign investors. Twenty percent of each 
center will be up for sale to a foreign energy concern later 
this year; another 15 percent will be sold to voucher holders 
during the second wave of privatization. The majority of the 
remaining 65 percent will be controlled by the FNM and local 
municipalities. 
  CEZ will have no choice but to compete as best it can in a 
free market, said Deputy Minister Cerny. "I hope they will play 
it very clever and set some long-term pricing contracts with 
their distributors," he said. 
  But what role the government, and specifically which 
ministry, would take in running the distribution centers was 
less clear. 
  "It is a problem of the whole energy plan," said Cerny. "We 
need to collaborate with the FNM to try to find some managers 
for these companies." 
  Revenues generated from the sale of the distribution centers 
will be under the control of the FNM, he said. The Ministry of 
Trade and Industry preferred to put the money back into energy 
services, he said. 
  Meanwhile, foreign companies that want to invest in Czech 
energy--either in a distribution center or by linking up with 
the transmission network--must do so before the new energy law 
is passed or regulations are put into place. 
  "Investors will have to take a risk," Cerny said.

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Gomez and Alan Crosby: "Bullish Forecast </F>
for Czech Construction Industry"] 
  [Text] Sooner or later, the country's construction industry 
will experience a boom. The question is, when? Following three 
years of drastic restructuring, the sector remains in a state of 
turmoil. Add to that the crippling impact of soaring costs and 
it's not surprising that analysts are sourly predicting slow 
growth at best for the industry in 1994. 
  The only glimmer of hope on the horizon appears to be 
housing 
construction, which began to show signs of life in the third 
quarter of 1993. Demand for new homes will presumably sustain 
growth in this sub sector, but for the rest of the industry, 
little is likely to change this year. 
  Construction output, which has declined the past three 
years, 
will remain stagnant, while the industry will continue to 
furiously downsize. 
  "A number of smaller firms will not be able to survive what 
will be a sweeping of the market," said one construction company 
manager. 
  Of all of the industrial sectors, the construction industry 
was one of the first to feel the impact of the country's 
economic transformation. Most of the gigantic state-owned 
concerns employing 10,000 or more workers collapsed. At the end 
of 1989, 158 construction companies existed in the Czech 
Republic. Of these, 77 were state-run enterprises with an 
average workforce of between 2,000 and 6,000. Construction 
output made up about 10 percent of national production, 
generating an annual turnover of around 65 billion Kc ($2.2 
billion). 
  Privatization of the industry, however, has changed these 
figures dramatically. Currently there are about 1,200 companies 
with 25 or more employees, and several thousand enterprises 
employing 25 or fewer workers. There are only 18 active 
companies that have a workforce of over 1,000 employees. A list 
of the more prominent companies now includes Metrostav, IPS 
Praha and Vodni stavby Praha. 
  These changes have given the industry a structure that more 
closely resembles Western European countries than a former 
Soviet satellite. In Germany, for example, there are about 
35,000 companies employing up to 10 workers, and approximately 
100 enterprises retaining a workforce of over 5,000. 
  The downsizing of the construction workforce has been 
paralleled by a similar reduction in construction revenues. 
Compared to 1990 (calculated in 1992 prices), the total volume 
of construction work declined from a value of 128 billion Kc to 
93.5 billion Kc (in 1993). This development resembled the arc of 
a playground swing: the largest decline occurred in 1991, 89 
billion Kc. The following year the total increased to 103 
billion Kc, and last year slipped to the aforementioned level. 
  Construction capacity is currently running at about 48 
percent. In 1990, construction output was valued at 83 billion 
Kc. Supply costs reached 48 billion Kc (representing 57.9 
percent of total overhead), while wage costs were over 14 
billion Kc (accounting for 17.7 percent of total costs). Profit 
surpassed a level of 6 billion Kc. The following year, output 
increased by 350 million Kc, while wage costs decreased by 660 
million Kc and supply costs rose by 3 billion Kc. 
  As a result, profits dipped to 2.92 billion Kc. In 1992, 
output plummeted to 67 billion Kc; however, supply and wage 
costs also fell, to 42.8 billion Kc and 10.5 billion Kc 
respectively. In turn, profit was only 1.8 billion Kc. 
  Absolute numbers have a tendency to drop. The reduction in 
profit was more dramatic than the fall in costs. This shouldn't 
come as a surprise, however. In 1990, costs accounted for about 
90 percent of the value of production. Two years later, they 
rose to a level of 97.2 percent. 
  Even though 1993 figures are still not known, they are 
unlikely to stray far from the past year's trend. Of course, the 
rate of inflation will influence these figures, but it's a given 
that enterprises have still not reached a proper level of 
efficiency. 
  Although the amount of private capital invested in the 
construction industry is rising (in 1992 it represented 13.9 
percent of the total investment in the sector), the state still 
has the final word. Its share of the investment in the sector 
reached 74.2 percent in 1992. The money covers large public 
works projects with a budgetary burden of over 100 million Kc. 
  Through the first half of 1993, the state was involved in 
913 
projects representing a cost of over 213 billion Kc. Attention 
has been focused on environmental and socially oriented works 
projects, transportation construction, and investment falling 
under state administration. 
  It is this rise in government investment, however, that has 
prompted analysts at Austrian-based Girocredit Research, a 
branch of the investment bank Girocredit, to declare it is 
"generally bullish on the construction sector [of the Czech 
Republic]." 
  While many former East bloc countries have looked to 
international markets for help, construction firms in the Czech 
Republic have stayed at home for the most part, concentrating on 
the domestic market. This has helped shield Czech companies from 
the declining markets of Eastern Europe, according to Girocredit. 
  Others are also predicting steady, if not spectacular 
growth, 
in the industry. David Lawn of the Prague office for Gleeds 
International, a construction consulting firm, is guardedly 
optimistic about the future. 
  "If the needed investment comes into the country, it bodes 
well for the construction industry, since a growing economy 
needs construction. A few large projects will really have a 
great effect on the sector's future," Lawn says. 
  If domestic markets are helping Czech firms prosper, success 
could stand in the way of international gains. As the Czech 
Republic's economy catches up to those of other countries, so 
too do costs. Already some of the competitive cost edge that 
Czech firms had over their Western counterparts has been lost 
due to rising wages. 
  Now countries like Ukraine hold an advantage in this 
respect, 
with the gap only expected to rise. This could force even deeper 
cuts in the industry as efficiency becomes more critical for 
survival.

  [Text] Budapest, 21 Mar (MTI) -- Prime Minister Peter 
Boross has sent a telegram of greetings to newly appointed 
Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik, wishing him success and 
expressing his satisfaction with Moravcik's statement, which 
took a stand for settling Hungarian-Slovak relations as soon as 
possible. "I believe good intentions on both sides will help us 
solve current problems and that the Hungarian and Slovak peoples 
will join their creative powers to tackle their common 
historical tasks," Boross wrote. 
  Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky sent his congratulations to 
his Slovak counterpart Eduard Kukan. Jeszenszky wrote he 
believed that improving Hungarian-Slovak links was considered to 
be a priority by the Slovak foreign minister, too.

  [Text] Budapest, 22 March (MTI) -- "Integration is the 
demand of our age, and any country failing to answer it will 
inevitably fall behind," Prime Minister Peter Boross said at the 
Tuesday [22 March] plenary session of parliament, arguing for 
submitting Hungary's bid for membership to the European Union 
[EU]. 
  "Hungary is returning to Europe. Although the EU is 
primarily based on common economic interests, the Hungarian 
Government is expecting the membership status to increase the 
country's security," Boross said. "In the long run, EU 
membership will eliminate the reason for concerns over the 
situation of Hungarian communities beyond the border, too," he 
added. 
  The prime minister said that borders would become passable 
in 
the Europe of regions, neighboring peoples would be connected 
more directly, and the common European law would guarantee 
minority rights. 
  Asked whether a referendum was intended to precede the 
admission, Boross said it would be due only after the issue 
getting on the EU agenda. Negotiations are expected to start in 
1997, and there is a chance for full membership in 1999 or the 
year 2000. 
  The current situation is favorable for submitting the bid, 
Boross said, because the EU states have just ratified the 
Maastricht treaty and can now turn to the new applicants. 
  "We have been assured of Hungary's favorable prospects. It 
would be a mistake to miss this historical opportunity," Boross 
said, asking Parliament to authorize the government to make this 
step.

  [Text] Budapest, March 18 (MTI) -- Sacked radio employees 
under retirement age should be reappointed, the fact-finding 
delegation of the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), 
uniting 300,000 journalists from 90 countries, concluded after a 
44-hour stay in Hungary, as was told on Friday at an 
international press conference in Budapest's House of Hungarian 
Press. On March 4, 91 state radio employees were dismissed and 
38 sent to retirement, including several leading editors and 
reporters. 
  Opposition parties accuse the government of having given 
their tacit support for the firings, which also affected a 
number of journalists known for their oppositional views. The 
ruling parties have repeatedly stressed the independence of 
radio leadership in the dismissals, and the government's lack of 
influence in the decision. 
  Hungarian Radio presently has a workforce of about 2,000. 
Radio leaders explained the sackings in terms of budgetary 
constraints. 
  IFJ's fact-finding committee, including first IFJ 
Vice-President Gustl Glattfelder, British Journalist Trade Union 
Secretary-General Jacob Ecclestone and Austrian Journalist 
Federation Vice-President Paul Vecsey, examined the situation at 
Hungarian Radio. 
  Glattfelder said they have not yet finished the inquiry and 
will present their report to the IFJ directorate at a later date. 
  However, they summed up recommendations in four points after 
meeting with Hungarian Radio Vice-President Laszlo Csucs, Prime 
Minister's Cabinet Chief Endre Marinovich and Prime Minister's 
Office State Secretary Jozsef Kajdi. 
  The IFJ delegation recommends that the dismissed be returned 
to their posts; that an ethical code be drawn up and published 
for the election campaign (the first round of Hungary's 
parliamentary elections will be held on May 8); that an 
independent parliamentary committee look into the radio's 
economic situation; and the new parliament give preference to 
the drafting of a media law after the elections. 
  Answering questions, Glattfelder said, "It is our belief 
that 
the radio employees were dismissed for political reasons."

<F P=106> [Lucy Hooker report: "Hungary's EU Hopes Blighted By Media </F>
Row"] 
  [Text] Budapest -- A row over political control of state 
radio, in which the Hungarian government is accused of meddling 
in the independence of the state media, could cast a shadow over 
Hungary's application for membership of the European Union [EU] 
next month. 
  The government denies involvement in the sackings of 129 
employees from the state radio earlier this month. They 
included some of the most experienced and best known journalists 
and editors. 
  With national elections only two months away, the dismissals 
are widely seen as an attempt to stifle criticism of the 
government and the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum which is 
trailing in the polls. 
  The Brussels-based International Federation of Journalists 
has strongly criticised the sackings and says its report "will 
be the basis of political action". Gustl Glatffelder, a radio 
journalist from German Sudwestfunk and chairman of the 
investigating committee, said: "Nobody could destroy our 
impression that indeed political reasons were behind it. 
  "The government gave (the head of radio) $1.02 million 
(700,000 pounds) to finance the firings. They can't say they 
haven't been involved." 
  Helsinki Watch, a division of Human Rights Watch, has 
already 
sent a letter to the prime minister, Peter Boross, "to express 
concern about dangers to freedom of expression with respect to 
state radio and television". 
  The acting head of radio Laszlo Csucs, insisted the firings 
were to reduce the heavy overstaffing of state radio but he also 
referred to "ethical and professional reasons". 
  Opposition parties have accused the government of crude 
political manipulation of the media. But the nationalist 
politician, Istvan Csurka, and his supporters have welcomed it 
as the start of a long overdue political cleansing of former 
communists from the state- owned media. 
  The government came under heavy criticism last autumn when 
the acting head of television axed Channel Two's evening news 
programme and suspended its staff. He accused them of 
manipulating a news report. 
  Since 1990, parliament has failed to pass a media law to 
regulate state broadcasting and distribute frequencies for 
commercial stations. The heads of state radio and television 
are government appointees. 
  The report from the International Federation of Journalists 
comes at an embarrassing time for the government as it prepares 
to submit its application for EU membership. "Evidently there 
are limits to how far the government can go. There are signs we 
are close to those limits, from the information we get from 
international bodies," Silvano Presa, from the European 
Commission delegation in Budapest, said.

  [Text] Budapest, 19 March (MTI) -- Prime Minister Peter 
Boross, deputy chairman of the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum 
(MDF), is confident that his party will fare well at the 
parliamentary elections in May and he himself can remain prime 
minister. Boross was speaking at a forum where the party's 
program was laid out, in Budapest on Saturday [19 March]. 
  He also spoke of what could not be implemented from the 
MDF's 
program, since when it was drawn up nobody could foresee the 
collapse of the Soviet Union, the South Slav war, and the 
economic recession in Western Europe. 
  On the past four years, the prime minister said that as a 
result of 40 years of socialism, the situation is still very 
bad, but the country's infrastructure has started to develop and 
inflation could be held under control. 
  Given the security policy vacuum in East-Central Europe, 
Hungary's situation is not simple, with Russia coming into play 
as well as the West and the United States, Boross said. 
  "In this situation, we want to provide for Hungary by 
linking 
it to the economic circuit leading to the market system of the 
future," he added. This is why Hungary, after agreeing with its 
friends in advance, is now applying to the European Union even 
if it knows that transition needed for full membership will take 
four to six years, the prime minister said. "We have to declare 
now where our country belongs." 
  According to Boross, the present and coming period requires 
serious people living for the country, considerate words, and 
predictability. He expressed his conviction that today the MDF 
is the political force that meets these requirements due to its 
personnel composition, belief, seriousness, determination, and 
firmness. 
  Boross said that, contrary to negative articles appearing in 
the Western press, his talks with leading politicians convinced 
him that they are well aware of how things stand in Hungary 
today. 
  He also said that Hungary's radio and television programs 
prove that the two institutions are not under governmental 
control despite all Western press allegations to the opposite. 
  Asked by reporters if AWACS would be a topic of his talks 
with Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene arriving in Hungary 
on Sunday [20 March], Boross said this question was also a 
likely topic, but the main issue will be bilateral links. 
  He added that Hungary has greater demands concerning the 
joining of various organizations and the prescheduled meetings 
give Hungarian politicians a good chance to outline Hungary's 
arguments and win over potential supporters. Boross hoped EU 
members will decide in favor of Hungary, so Dehaene's visit is 
very important for the country's future.

Szajer in second place, followed by Parliamentary faction leader 
Laszlo Kover, acting Deputy Chairman Janos Ader, and Tamas 
Deutsch, deputy chairman in charge of information. 
  Szajer announced that Orban is the Fidesz's prime minister 
candidate for the event the party is elected to a government 
position. The board authorized the party chairman to make minor 
changes in the list if necessary.

  [Text] Budapest, 18 March (MTI) -- A Romanian river 
freighter was held up at Mohacs on the south Hungarian stretch 
of the Danube due to its violation of UN sanctions against rump 
Yugoslavia, local customs authorities told MTI. 
  The ship, Slobozia Mare, arrived at Mohacs on Monday [14 
March] with Budapest as its destination. When checked 
thoroughly for compliance of embargo regulations, it was found 
to be carrying only 18 tonnes of oil instead of the 52 tonnes 
indicated in its official documents, with water replacing the 
missing quantity. 
  According to unconfirmed information, the Romanian captain 
and the crew of two Serbs and six Ukrainians admitted to having 
sold the missing oil, worth 2.7 million forints ($1 equals 103 
forints), in Serbia. Customs investigations are continuing.

  [Text] Budapest, 21 Mar (MTI) -- The new Slovak 
Government's aim is to improve its country's general image, 
requiring higher standards in politics, Slovak Defence Minister 
Pavol Kanis told a press conference after meeting his Hungarian 
host and counterpart Lajos Fur in Budapest today. Kanis said 
Slovakia hoped for better ties with Hungary, between the two 
countries and also the two ministries. 
  "Our talks covered regional security, bilateral military 
cooperation, NATO's peace partnership programme, and cooperation 
between the Visegrad countries," the Slovak minister said. 
  Fur saw the new Slovak foreign policy as promising, citing 
as 
a major gesture that Kanis visited Budapest first. 
Hungarian-Slovak military cooperation has gone well so far, Fur 
added. 
  Kanis said the new government wished to use the half a year 
up until the elections to intensify foreign relations. 
"Nationalism in Central Europe implies isolationism, while 
integration symbolises openness, and balance in the region," he 
said.

  [Text] Budapest, 18 Mar (MTI) -- Defence Minister Lajos 
Fur held a press conference on Friday to introduce a recently 
published book on national defence in Hungary over the past four 
years. An oversized, overorganized, and offensive army, a 
former member of the Warsaw Treaty Organization, had to become a 
defence force, he said. 
  In recent years, the 150,000-strong staff (including civil 
employees) has shrunk by 33 percent. Simultaneously, the number 
of army officers has been cut from 27,500 to 22,000, Fur said. 
  The minister said that the army, which used to be 
concentrated in Transdanubia, had to be redeployed. 
  Airborne, rapid deployment units have been formed to meet 
the 
new kind of challenges Hungary has become exposed to, mainly by 
the war in former Yugoslavia, he continued. There are now 
national defence brigades and, in accord with NATO's peace 
partnership scheme, will soon start training peacekeeping 
forces, Fur said. 
  The Hungarian army used to be marked by an internationalist 
spirit, but is now a national army, the minister said. Fur said 
lack of funds holds up army technical development.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 18 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government 
today said it regretted Hungary's abuse of the accident of the 
Ukrainian tugboat Zernograd at Gabcikovo earlier this year for 
"dubious propaganda" against the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros 
hydroproject on the Danube. 
  A statement by the Slovak Foreign Ministry addressed to the 
members of the Danube Commission, received by CTK today, said 
that Hungary's representative to the Commission had accused 
Slovakia of failure to honor the official system of announcing 
emergency occurrences on the Danube. 
  According to preliminary information by Slovak authorities, 
the accident in the lock at Gabcikovo was due to man's failure 
as the captain grossly violated regulations guiding passage 
through the lock. 
  "The unequivocal conclusions stated by Hungary are evidently 
aimed at discrediting the reliability of the Gabcikovo 
hydroproject and its positive contribution to international 
navigation and to its safety," the statement says. 
  It points out without specification that Hungary's 
"unilateral" moves, that are at variance with its international 
commitments, raise serious obstacles to international navigation. 
  The statement also points out Hungary's effort "to get the 
Danube Commission entangled in the dispute between Slovakia and 
Hungary [over Gabcikovo] even though both parties have agreed to 
settle the dispute before the International Court of Justice in 
The Hague." 
  The statement also protests against the effort to include 
Gabcikovo in the agenda of the Danube Commission's 
deliberations. It stresses that at the next session of the 
Commission's relevant body, Slovakia will raise the question of 
"seeking solution to the unfavorable navigation conditions 
caused by the moves taken by Hungary." 
  Under agreement reached by Slovak and Ukrainian bodies the 
Zernograd will be removed from the lock on Saturday [19 March].

  [Text] Prague, March 21 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef 
Moravcik told Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus he would propose 
postponing the requirement for import certificates for one month 
at the next meeting with his government, he told journalists 
today. 
  Moravcik was in Prague for several hours tonight on the 
occasion of the opening of the European Banking Forum. 
  Moravcik also said he and Klaus agreed that the customs 
union 
between the two countries needed to be developed. 
  The two premiers spoke as well about the topic of the 
countries' borders, and Moravcik noted that his government 
intended to re-evaluate the previous government's decision in

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, March 18 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] 
The new privatization minister, Milan Janicina, speaks about the 
problem of feverish privatization [by the outgoing government of 
Vladimir Meciar in its last days in office] in an interview with 
today's edition of the independent SME newspaper. He claims 
many projects were incomplete and their approval therefore was 
against the law. 
  Commenting on the suspicion that Meciar destroyed certain 
documents before vacating his chair as acting head of the 
Privatization Ministry, Janicina says that neither Meciar nor 
his state secretary Ivan Lexa gave him an agenda, and he even 
had to borrow a secretary so someone could make him coffee. 
  Janicina intends to propose that the new government rescind 
the former government's resolution on the approval of 
privatization projects. He said there were no plans as yet to 
replace ministry staff. What was important was the staff "are 
able and have clean hands," he said.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 18 (CTK) -- The law on 
large-scale privatization was passed today in its original form 
after being re-discussed by the Slovak Parliament. 
  Notes added to the bill by Meciar's government before its 
fall a week ago, were not accepted by parliament. This means 
that the most controversial point in the law, which forbids 
members of the government or parliament from simultaneously 
being members of the presidium, executive committee, or 
supervisory council of the National Property Fund (FNM), was not 
changed. FNM representatives must be nominated by the relevant 
parliamentary committee, whose proposal must be approved by 
parliament. 
  The only proposal of the former government accepted by 
parliament in the legislation was that FNM funds may be used for 
the purpose of increasing the capital stock of trade companies 
that are associates of the FNM or in which the FNM has a stake. 
  The law should ensure that conditions for the transfer of 
property from the state to a third party not be subject to 
suspicion or criminalization, said Juraj Plesnik, vice-chairman 
of parliament's Privatization Committee. Parliament will look 
into the privatization methods used by Meciar's government in 
February, when capital stock in enterprises in which foreign 
firms are interested were sold under very lucrative conditions, 
he added. Most of the approved privatization projects are not 
backed financially, he stated. 
  Meciar's government in its last weeks sold property valuing 
three billion Slovak korunas ($96.800 million), but only 600 
million korunas (about $19 million) worth was backed by loans.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 21 (CTK) -- The leaders of the 
five political parties which took part in the formation of the 
new Slovak government of Jozef Moravcik signed a coalition 
agreement today. 
  The agreement was signed by Moravcik (Democratic Union of 
Slovakia, DUS), Peter Weiss (Democratic Left Party, SDL), Jan 
Carnogurksy (Christian Democratic Movement, KDH), Milan Knazko 
(Alliance of Democrats) and Ludovit Cernak (New Alternative). 
  The agreement is to help preserve harmony within the rather 
heterogeneous coalition comprising post-communists (SDL), the 
right-orientated KDH and the centrist bloc formed by 
"dissidents" from Meciar's part of Slovakia's political scene. 
  Coalition talks are also to be attended by the Hungarian 
parliamentary parties, the Egyutteles movement and the Hungarian 
Christian Democratic Party (MKDH), which have not signed the 
agreement and which are not represented on the new government, 
but which have pledged support for it under certain conditions. 
  MKDH Deputy Chairman Pavol Farkas said the Hungarian parties 
would cooperate with the new government if it fulfilled 
recommendations from the Council of Europe concerning the use of 
bilingual road sign-posts and the use of names and surnames for 
ethnic Hungarians, and if it carried out "certain personnel 
changes" at ministries and acceded to the European charter of 
minority languages and the charter of regional self-rule. 
  Moravcik said he hoped the agreement would allow his 
government to submit to the citizens an alternative of further 
progress towards Slovakia's development and political stability. 
  Under the agreement, concrete decisions will be considered 
by 
a special council consisting of the chairmen of the coalition 
parties and the chairmen of the party deputies' groups who will 
coordinate cooperation in the Parliament. 
  Carnogursky said "the principle of consensus, that is the 
right of each subject to veto, will be applied in the coalition 
on the most important questions." 
  He stressed the agreement contained no secret supplement 
like 
that concluded by Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS). 
  The programme statement, which the government is to submit 
to 
the parliament within 30 days of its appointment on March 16, is 
expected to be a much more difficult test of its ability to 
reach compromise. 
  The government will be in power until early elections are 
held on September 30-October 1. 
  Cernak said the statement would be submitted to the 
parliament on April 12. 
  Knazko said "today put an end to the myth that agreement 
could not be reached in Slovakia's political life." 
  Cernak said the effort to reach a broader political 
consensus 
was proved by the fact that the new coalition had offered to the 
opposition posts in the presidium and supervisory council of the 
National Property Fund at which personnel changes would be 
carried out. The HZDS as well the SNS have already proposed 
their candidates, Cernak added. 
  The new coalition commands a total of 83 votes in the 
150-seat parliament if the 14 Hungarian and two independent 
deputies are included. 
  Observers do not rule out that the quality of the 
functioning 
of Moravcik's government, whose initiators were united mainly by 
opposition to Meciar, will indicate chances of a similar 
coalition being formed after the early elections.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 20 (CTK) -- "We were not too 
enthusiastic about the (Slovak ethnic) Hungarian parties not 
being taken into account when the new government was composed," 
Arpad Duka-Zolyomi, deputy chairman of the ethnic Hungarian 
party Egyutteles (Coexistence), said in a televised debate today. 
  However, he said his party was willing to cooperate with the 
new government despite the Hungarian parties not being members 
of the government coalition. The previous cabinet of Vladimir 
Meciar rejected any dialogue, he added. 
  Zolyomi said he agreed that the ethnic Hungarian parties 
held 
the balance of power in the Slovak parliament. 
  Premier Jozef Moravcik said that the coalition parties 
expected the above mentioned cooperation. A hierarchy of 
problems solvable before early elections, to be held at the end 
of September and beginning of October, has been created, 
Moravcik added.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 20 (CTK) -- The behavior of the 
Slovak National Party (SNS) will be fully oppositional, similar 
to that of the behavior of the former opposition, the chairman 
of the SNS parliamentary group of deputies, Miloslav Kona, told 
Slovak television today. 
  He stressed that the SNS would react to all steps taken by 
the government. "The SNS is waiting for signals by the 
government and then we will response," he noted. 
  Kona said he was convinced that Slovakia's ethnic Hungarian 
parties, with which the new cabinet wants to cooperate, did not 
contribute to a calm atmosphere on the Slovak political scene. 
  Before the early elections scheduled for autumn, the SNS 
intends to focus on attitudes of the Hungarian parties and 
reactions to them. "The SNS finds it very interesting that it is 
the Hungarian parties which hold the balance of power in 
Parliament," Kona said.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, March 18 (CTK) -- All Slovak dailies 
today comment on Thursday's [17 March] surprisingly unanimous 
passage of the law on shortening the electoral term and calling 
early elections for September 30 and October 1. 
  "The government of Jozef Moravcik was loudly referred to as 
a 
temporary one, but this became truth only yesterday," the 
left-leaning daily PRAVDA comments. 
  PRAVDA believes that the deputies from the former government 
coalition (now in the opposition after the fall of the cabinet 
of Vladimir Meciar a week ago) supported the autumn electoral 
date also because "after their attempt to push through a 
referendum they had no further means at their disposal to force 
an earlier electoral date. They accepted reality... and 
preferred the autumn certainty to the uncertainty of another 
referendum. This is also all right," PRAVDA's commentator 
writes. "Why should people be sent to ballot boxes if the same 
can be acquired comfortably and above all more cheaply by 
pressing a button?," he concludes. 
  SLOVENSKY DENNIK, the daily close to the government 
coalition 
Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), points out that it would be 
inconvenient for the opposition (which governed until March 11) 
if elections were put off by two years, until the end of the 
cabinet's regular electoral term, from two reasons. First -- 
their machinations with Slovakia's property would surface, of 
which, they hope, the public will learn nothing. Second -- 
their popularity would sink deeply below zero, because they do 
no longer control the state tools to make their propaganda. 
Therefore they agreed to early elections, SLOVENSKY DENNIK 
states. 
  The independent NARODNA OBRODA is convinced that the 
unambiguous decision on the electoral date was also due to a 
small number of valid signatures on petition lists, by which the 
former government coalition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS) wanted to push through a referendum. If the HZDS wanted 
to keep its face and push for really immediate calling of 
elections, it had no other rational possibility than to vote for 
the autumn date. HZDS deputies did so despite Meciar's 
promising a four-question referendum and the dismissal of the 
president. 
  The tabloid NOVY CAS notes that the Thursday's vote also 
definitively decided on fate of the deputies elected to the 
Federal Assembly (defunct in late 1992, before Czechoslovakia's 
split into two independent states). Their mandate will end with 
the early elections. 
  Referring to the vote, the paper states that "the opposition 
(the HZDS and the Slovak National Party, SNS) faced the choice 
of either supporting stabilization or sharpening confrontation 
and tension among people. "At last common sense beat party and 
personal interests. The unanimous vote by coalition and 
opposition deputies indicates that the HZDS and the SNS are 
capable of accepting their political loss in a dignified manner. 
Although it was the second loss within a short period, it still 
does not imply any threat to Slovakia's stability or democracy," 
NOVY CAS comments. 
  By Thursday's decision of the parliament, the government 
coalition gained six months, in the course of which it will try 
to prove -- and persuade the voters -- that an alternative way 
of ruling is also possible in Slovakia, other than the 
incompetent and somewhat authoritative rule, writes the 
independent daily SME. 
  All political parties, mainly the newly emerging parties 
surrounding Ludovit Cernak (who left the SNS) and Roman Kovac 
(leader of the Slovak Democratic Union which split from the 
HZDS), now have enough time to consolidate and address potential 
voters. "Above all, the former opposition was given a chance to 
show to the former coalition that it was possible to rule 
better, and the former coalition can show to the former 
opposition what its idea of a constructive opposition used to 
be. Let us see it correctly -- the pre-election campaign 
started in Slovakia on Thursday," the paper concludes. [passage

today reports on the so-called eastern corridor for the delivery 
of goods and raw materials for Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] via Bulgaria. It reports 50 to 
60 tanks of fuel cross into Macedonia every day, supplying 1,500 
tons of oil products to Macedonia's economy struggling under an 
embargo imposed by Greece. 
  The daily emphasizes that road tankers of Macedonia's MLAZ 
Bogdanci Shipping Agency enjoy privileges during the loading of 
fuels at Bulgarian terminals near Burgas, Plovdiv and Sofia and 
the border crossing at Novo Selo-Zlatarevo.

formed state is trying to change the situation in this 
multinational country," Mazowiecki, UN envoy for human rights 
in the FYROM, said in an interview with FLAKA E VLLAZERIMIT. 
  Referring to this interview, the BBC points out that very 
few 
Albanians in this republic have been engaged in the state 
structures of this country, stressing that this this phenomenon 
in evident mostly in the government, army, police, 
administration and in different political and social 
institutions. Mr. Mazowiecki emphasized that the human rights 
situation is not good in the fields of information and education. 
  "The newly formed Macedonian state, a new member of the UNO 
[UN Organization], should respect the rights and freedoms of the 
non Macedonian people, the more so because the perspective of 
this state depends on the observation of international norms and 
laws," Mr. Mazowiecki said in conclusion.

  [Text] Tirana, March 18 (ATA) -- As the result of 
Albanians' transfer from Kosova due to Serbian persecution and 
violence, new Serbian population centres are being formed in 
Prishtina. 
  According to a decision of the Serbian leaders of the 
Prishtina commune, 50 construction sites will be given to 
Serbians who will be settled in Kosova. The sites are located 
in the "Dragogan" Quarter in Prishtina. The place is sufficient 
to provide residence for 15,000 inhabitants, that is the same 
number of Serbians are expected to live in this area. 
  In this context, 150 houses are foreseen to be constructed 
near the Technical Faculty while 100 construction sites will be 
granted at the "Tasligje" Quarter. All the sites will be given 
to Serbians free of charge. The sale of the construction sites 
is prohibited, leaving no possibilities for the Albanians to buy 
them. 
  Such undertakings of colonization have existed before in 
Kosova and will also continue in the future in other Kosova 
zones.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Kiro Gligorov by Misha Glenny in </F>
Skopje; date not given: "`Against Orthodox Bloc'"] 
  [Text] [Glenny] Mr. President, were you surprised by the 
Greek blockade against your country in February? 
  [Gligorov] Yes. When they first tried -- in October 1992 -- 
they did not achieve anything. The blockade could not prevent 
our recognition by the European Union [EU] states. The impetus 
for it came from an intra-Greek power struggle. Had the 
Mitsotakis government remained in power then we would have 
achieved a solution together with Vance and Owen. Yet, the new 
head of government, Papandreou, feels bound by his 
anti-Macedonian statements from the election campaign and is 
trying to harness the EU to his cart. Yet, six EU countries 
have already recognized us -- and now even the United States. 
The Greek embargo is a nervous reaction to our success. 
  [Glenny] The Albanian party has split up into two factions. 
The radicals have requested identical rights for the Albanians 
as for the Macedonians at all levels. Does this worry you? 
  [Gligorov] The division of the Albanian ethnic group is a 
normal democratic process. We must pursue dialogue with all 
groups. So far we have survived because we have avoided the kind 
of nationalism that erupted everywhere in the former Yugoslavia. 
  [Glenny] Do you think that the U.S.-supported Muslim-Croat 
alliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina will work? 
  [Gligorov] I have always been of the opinion that Bosnia- 
Herzegovina should be preserved as one. The Muslim-Croat 
alliance is one step forward. Yet, how will the Serbs react? 
The United States is afraid that the war might spread to the 
south, and it seems to be interested in preserving Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. If the 
dispute were to come here it would mean a new war in the Balkans 
-- which is why I cannot understand why Greece is acting the way 
it is. If war were to break out here it would affect all Balkan 
countries. 
  [Glenny] Is it true that Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic invited you to a Christian-Orthodox alliance with 
Greece and Cyprus? 
  [Gligorov] There is the idea of a large bloc, which should 
comprise Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Macedonia, Greece, 
and Cyprus. Yet, Macedonia is looking toward Europe and is 
against the creation of new alliances. I frankly said so to 
Milosevic when he proposed to me the creation of such an 
Orthodox alliance from Belgrade via Skopje to Athens and Cyprus. 
I said that Macedonia would never join such an alliance that is 
based on religion and nationalities. The Greeks are afraid of a 
Muslim alliance, but we do not want that, either. We are hoping 
for an associative membership agreement with the EU, which might 
ultimately lead to membership in 15 years. I also wrote to 
President Clinton that we would like to participate in NATO's 
Partnership for Peace.

  [Text] Vienna, March 21 (CTK) -- New Slovak Finance 
Minister Rudolf Filkus, in an interview with the Austrian Press 
Agency (APA) today, sharply criticizes the privatization process 
headed by ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar. 
  Filkus says that the privatization process in Slovakia, from 
the important instrument of economy transformation, turned into 
an instrument for the concentration of political power. 
  It is therefore important to speed up privatization and 
primarily to depolitize it, Filkus says. Millions were 
squandered through the "sale" of state-owned enterprises at 
funny prices to people who "guarantee" that they will support 
the "leading role of the party" with their capital, Filkus says, 
referring to Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). 
He says these steps by Meciar's cabinet bordered on legitimacy 
and that is why he, in the capacity of finance minister, intends 
to investigate these operations. Filkus says he has prohibited 
trading in the National Property Fund (FNM) shares and frozen 
its accounts. 
  The Slovak state deficit currently reaches 5.174 billion 
Slovak crowns (about $172 billion), Filkus says. "It is not 
little, but also not much," he says, adding that a 14 billion 
Slovak crown deficit can be expected by the end of the year. 
  The hard currency reserves in Slovakia, excluding gold, 
amount to $440 million. However, Slovakia's foreign debt is 
enormous -- about 60 billion Slovak crowns ($2 billion). "We 
have paid more than 10 billion crowns to the National Bank in 
interest only," Filkus says. 
  The Bratislava government should ensure its income better, 
he 
says, adding that it is impossible to merely cut expenditures, 
any fool could do that. Besides, there is nothing to be cut in 
the fields of education, health care, or culture, Filkus adds. 
He says he sees state budget reserves in the better control of 
income from Value Added Tax (VAT) and custom payments and in 
fighting tax evasion as well. 
  Filkus says he wants to exert pressure on the FNM so that 
profits received from privatization are used to lower the state 
debt. He gave as an example the Czech Republic, where 17 
billion Czech crowns (almost $0.2 billion) were allocated by the 
FNM to lower the state debt. 
  Filkus expresses disappointment about the ineffectuality of 
the 10 percent import surcharge introduced by Slovakia recently. 
He says that although the import surcharge is an "absolutely 
normal instrument of a market economy," whose aim is to free the 
market and give domestic products a better chance to succeed, it 
affects Czech goods primarily and has failed to activate the 
domestic market. He criticizes Slovak producers who, instead of 
trying to succeed through cheaper goods, raised the prices of 
their good by the same 10 percent, in the interest of quick 
profits. 
  Asked about the political prospects of the new government 
and 
the possibility of Meciar becoming premier again, Filkus says: 
"It cannot happen that he will return to power for the third 
time." "It would apparently be a wonder of the world," he adds.

  [Text] The urgent session of the Tetovo city parliament, 
held March 17 on the occasion of arresting several Albanians 
from Tetovo and its surroundings, and also attended, on 
insistence of the deputies, by [Interior] Minister Frckovski, 
brought several resolutions. The city officials demanded 
unconditional releasing of the arrested citizens, beginning with 
ex-PDP [the Party for Democratic Prosperity] Secretary Mithat 
Emini and ending with the most recently arrested group of 
Albanian citizens on March 16. Furthermore, they requested 
arrests and oppression of Albanians to cease in future, because, 
they claimed political process are fabricated in order to 
discredit NDP [the Peoples' Democratic Party] and PDP and the 
Albanians at all. They accuse the government of creating an 
atmosphere of anxiety with an aim to put PDP members under 
control and to present the Albanians as a factor introducing 
instability in the country. The session was interrupted to be 
continued March 22, when Internal Minister Ljubomir Frckovski 
and Justice Minister Tuse Gosev will appear in person and inform 
the Tetovo parliament of their decision on the submitted demands.

  [Text] Prague, March 18 (CTK) -- Former Czechoslovak 
Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier said today he knew nothing 
about dangerous strains of bacteria and viruses designated for 
the production of biological weapons having been stored in the 
Czech Republic. 
  Dienstbier, foreign minister from December 1989 until June 
1992, told journalists that at the time when he was a 
Czechoslovak cabinet member, the possibility of nuclear, 
biological or chemical weapons being stored on Czechoslovak 
territory was investigated. "The Army had revised these things 
and.... as far as I know nothing was found," Dienstbier said. 
  Petr Pithart, Czech premier from February 1990 until June 
1992, told CTK that "he had no idea" about biological weapons 
being stored in the Czech Republic. He added, however, that the 
army was not within the jurisdiction of the Czech Government. 
He said it could have happened that "something was forgotten 
somewhere" but the question could not be linked to political 
motifs. 
  Some Czech papers reported on Thursday [17 March] and today 
that Czechoslovakia was charged with developing bacteriological 
weapons in the framework of the former Warsaw Pact. A secret 
branch of the Military Research Institute located in the 
vicinity of the village of Techonin in the Orlicke Mountains, 
east Bohemia, allegedly served this goal. The cultures of 
bacteria and viruses developed there were allegedly hidden at 
different place in the Czech Republic. 
  According to press reports, this would mean not only 
violation of the Czech Republic's international commitments 
since it is a signatory of the Geneva Convention whose members 
had pledged not to develop, use or store biological weapons 
without international consent, but also crime threatening the 
public. 
  Chairman of the Czech Parliament's Defense and Security 
Committee Vladimir Suman has asked Defense Minister Antonin 
Baudys on Thursday to inform the committee about the alleged 
storage of bacteriological and virological weapons in the Czech 
Republic on April 7. Suman told journalists this today at a 
press conference of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) of which he 
is a member.

  [Text] Prague, March 18 (CTK) -- Czech Defense Minister 
Antonin Baudys today denied the presence of biological weapons 
in the Czech Republic, reported by the press on Thursday [17 
March]. However, he told journalists that two banks of virus 
strains which were used in research and for protection and 
defense purposes were destroyed at his order. 
  He said in February he had been informed about the existence 
of a bank of virus strains used in research in the Central 
Military Hospital in Prague-Stresovice. The same applies to a 
similar bank in the Immunology and Microbiology Institute of the 
Military Medical Academy in Techonin, east Bohemia, of which he 
was informed in March. 
  These banks of virus strains were destroyed as there was no 
further need in them, Baudys said, adding that the bank in the 
Stresovice hospital was destroyed on February 25, and the bank 
in Techonin at the beginning of March. 
  Baudys said a commission of experts from the Defense and 
Health Ministries had been set up to study the matter. The 
experts took necessary safety measures and destroyed the 
strains. He said these substances were stored in minimum 
amounts for medical purposes as they were used in research and 
therefore served the defense purposes. They did not have the 
nature of biological weapons and their storage did not 
contradict the Geneva Convention through which the Czech 
Republic had pledged not to develop, produce or store biological 
weapons. 
  Baudys said he wanted to calm down the Czech public. He was 
thus reacting to press reports on Thursday and today according 
to which dangerous strains of bacteria and viruses have been 
developed in the Military Medical Academy in Techonin to be used 
for the production of biological weapons. The daily CESKY DENIK 
wrote that these substances were stored at several places in the 
Czech Republic. "These reports can "incite people's fantasy," 
[quotation marks as received] Baudys said. 
  Specialists present at the press conference confirmed that 
the virus strains designated for diagnostics were safely stored 
in liquid nitrogen and their liquidation was also safe. They 
said a bank of virus strains was created in the Techonin 
institute in 1970-1980 and was used for research, primarily for 
the production of sera. 
  "Banal" strains, for example, viruses causing influenza made 
up 80 percent of the strains stored in the bank, while only 20 
percent were "especially dangerous and exotic" strains, director 
of the Military Academy Vladimir Radovnicky said. He said there 
was also a bank of diagnostic sera in the institute and this 
will be preserved. 
  Ales Macela, pro-rector for research in the Military Medical 
Academy, said the institute in Techonin was opened in 1972. He 
said he had been working there since 1975 and there had never 
been conditions there for the production of a larger amount of 
microbes necessary to produce biological weapons. 
  He said the institute was dealing with immunological 
research 
and, among other things, with testing preparations. Tissues and 
animals were used for this purposes. The institute is not 
"particularly secret" and is accessible to foreign experts as 
well, Macela said, adding that Swedish specialists visited the 
institute last year.

  [Text] Moscow, March 18 (CTK) -- Chairman of the 
ultra-nationalist Russian Liberal Democrats Vladmir Zhirinovskiy 
has decided to indefinitely postpone his Prague visit, 
representatives of the party told the Moscow branch of CTK today. 
  The same sources said it was "99.99 percent sure" that 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy would not come to Prague this Sunday. 
  Grigoriy Serebrennikov said it was "very unlikely" that the 
visit would take place this month. Asked what the missing 
hundredth of a percent could represent, Serebrennikov replied 
"Nothing, really." 
  He said that Zhirinovskiy was concentrating at present on 
internal party problems and that on Sunday [20 March] and Monday 
he had engagements in Moscow. "He must have made a mistake," 
Serebrennikov said of Zhirinovskiy's announcement on March 14 
that he would arrive in the Czech Republic for a two-day visit 
on March 20. 
  The postponement of Zhirinovskiy's visit to the Czech 
Republic at the invitation of the far-right Assembly for the 
Republic- Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) was announced 
after a representative of the Liberal Democratic Party discussed 
the issue with a representative of the Czech Embassy in Moscow. 
  Unofficial sources say the Liberal Democrats were warned 
that 
their leader's visit to Prague was considered by the Czech 
Government to be "extremely inappropriate," and that it intended 
to use the possibilities offered by Czech law. Zhirinovskiy's 
circles apparently took this warning as a signal that the same 
thing might happen in the Czech Republic as happened in 
Slovenia, where on March 6 Zhirinovskiy got only as far as 
transit at Ljubljana airport and was forced to return to Moscow 
a day later. 
  Officially, however, the leaders of the Liberal Democratic 
Party are not admitting the possibility that the postponement of 
the visit to Prague could be connected with the wave of 
disapproving reactions which the announcement of his visit 
provoked in the Czech Republic. 
  The journeys abroad of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy since last 
December's Russian elections have been accompanied by a series 
of scandals. He was expelled from Bulgaria, Romania announced 
him an undesirable person and banned his entrance into the 
country, Germany refused to give him an entrance visa and 
Austria, France and Spain proceeded similarly. 
  Zhirinovskiy does not need a visa to visit the Czech 
Republic, but only a diplomatic passport, to which as a deputy 
he has a right.

<F P=106> [Yanora Grigorova commentary: "It Is Our Own Fault If We </F>
Are Making Fools of Ourselves"] 
  [Text] A few days ago a Greek daily reported that in his 
recent letter to Turkey's Demirel President Zhelev left a door 
slightly open regarding our noninterference in Bosnia. The 
Greek daily claimed that the pressure exerted by U.S. Ambassador 
Montgomery was the reason for Zhelev's halfhearted attitude. 
  The nervous reaction of the president's spokesman following 
the article was counterproductive as usual. Instead of denying 
the Greek daily's report, it practically confirmed it. 
  Ambassador Montgomery himself further complicated the 
situation by bringing a whole delegation of highranking U.S. 
officials to Bulgaria immediately after the denial. Even an 
acknowledged member of the National Security Council was among 
them. They admitted discussing the Balkan situation with 
Bulgarian political forces. People from the Bulgarian Socialist 
Party [BSP] somewhat self-consciously admitted that they had 
supported the official Bulgarian policy on the conflict in 
Bosnia, the Rights and Freedoms Movement [DPS] members did not 
say anything, and the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] 
representatives boasted of being the only ones who have a 
consistent approach on the Balkan issue. 
  As a matter of fact, none of them denied KONTINENT's 
information that the Americans had tested the approach of the 
political forces to a more specific interpretation of the 
nebulous "active neutrality" concept. The interpretation in 
question would also be likely to include such things as granting 
an air corridor to Turkey, placing our airports at the disposal 
of NATO aircraft patrolling Bosnia, and so forth. 
  The current situation can be described as ludicrous not so 
much because the United States is trying to exert pressure upon 
us for such activities. It is their right to do so. However, 
it is our right to refuse them. It is preposterous that we 
should not do so. 
  It has long since been known that our political forces 
cannot 
agree even on matters as elementary as two plus two. 
Nevertheless, whenever foreign emissaries are touring their 
party headquarters trying to persuade them to support one state 
to the detriment of another, their unfortunate Bulgarian 
constituents who still live in a country situated between these 
two states are entitled to hear a firmer stand than the little 
jokes about "we would be glad if Mr. Montgomery interfered in 
our domestic affairs."

<F P=106> [Interview with Jordan Kostadinov, chairman of the Ilinden </F>
United Macedonian Organization, by Valeriya Veleva; place and 
date not given: "Whoever Tries To Prove Macedonians Are 
Bulgarians Is Waging Propaganda for War in the Balkans"; first 
paragraph gives biographical details that appear in a box 
together with 1.5 x 1.5-inch photograph of Kostadinov] 
  [Text] Yordan Kostadinov was born in the village of 
Ilindentsi, in Sandanski district. He used to work as a teacher 
of mechanical engineering. At the constituent meeting of the 
Ilinden OMO [United Macedonian Organization], held on 14 March 
1990 in the town of Sandanski, he was elected deputy chairman of 
the organization. Later, after the Ilinden OMO split, he was 
elected chairman of the extreme right wing. 
  [Veleva] Mr. Kostadinov, what are the aims of the Ilinden 
OMO? 
  [Kostadinov] During the four years since its formation, the 
Ilinden OMO has campaigned for the granting of national rights 
to the Macedonians. We are entitled to seek our rights, and not 
to be oppressed by those who want to ensure that the voice of a 
Macedonian declaring that he is a Macedonian is not heard. What 
we have been subjected to was a genocide and an assimilation. 
So far, over 150 of our people have been beaten by the 
authorities. Where is Bulgarian democracy going? Their 
propaganda describes us as riffraff, as crazy people, and yet we 
have winegrowers, tractor drivers, engineers, and teachers among 
our members. You media people incite the violence that the 
government and the authorities are practicing against us. What 
you are doing is covered by Bulgaria's Penal Code. The Ilinden 
OMO is a defender of national minorities, and whoever tries to 
prove that Macedonians are Bulgarians is waging propaganda for 
war in the Balkans! 
  [Veleva] However, according to the Constitution, Bulgaria is 
a one-nation state, so on what basis do you claim that a 
Macedonian national minority exists? 
  [Kostadinov] Look here, it is distinguished by its own 
culture, its own mentality, its own peculiarities, spirituality, 
and needs, in that it does not want to live oppressed by these 
Bulgarian policies and propaganda. This is what I mean. 
  [Veleva] How do Bulgarian policies oppress you? 
  [Kostadinov] Our population lives in a state of stress and 
neurotic fear. Old women still cover their heads with black 
scarves. What are we to say about this? How can I allow myself 
in my life to bear candles and flowers, and then you come along 
and beat me about the head. This is madness! 
  [Veleva] Is your home village within the borders of 
Macedonia or Bulgaria? 
  [Kostadinov] Within the borders of Macedonia. 
  [Veleva] In which language are you speaking at the moment, 
Mr. Kostadinov? 
  [Kostadinov] Language?... Look here now, we will not come 
to blows about the language. What language do the people of 
Radomir speak? I listened to some Ukrainians talking, and I 
understood them better than people from Radomir. We did not 
borrow the Macedonian language from our neighbors the Serbs or 
the Bulgarians, because we in fact gave our neighbors their 
written language. Macedonia was never occupied by the First or 
Second Bulgarian Kingdoms. Our language is the oldest in this 
region. 
  [Veleva] Who created the Macedonian language? 
  [Kostadinov] My God! You... I am sorry that I cannot speak 
to you as melodically as my grandmother and grandfather did. I 
at least have heard comments from old people who have been in 
Bulgaria and said that the people there did not understand their 
language. Are you trying to provoke me now? As long as this 
nation has existed, it has spoken its own language. Did you 
send textbooks to Preslav? Did you send us the alphabet? Did 
you open schools in the sixth, seventh, and eighth centuries? 
Why do you pick on these matters? 
  [Veleva] Who is your favorite author? 
  [Kostadinov] Krustyo Misirkov, who speaks in the Macedonian 
language. Read his book; if you do not have it, we will send 
you a copy so that you can find out what he writes. His book 
was published in Sofia and then forgotten. You see now, bans 
and harassment have existed for more than 70 years. Our 
politics have remained the same. 
  [Veleva] How many members does your organization have? 
  [Kostadinov] In Pirin Macedonia [part of Bulgaria] there are 
400,000-500,000. As regards how many members we have, we cannot 
tell you, because we do not want to. However, 70-80 percent of 
the population of Pirin Macedonia support us, but will not say 
so under the risk of fear. We simply want to avoid bloodshed. 
  [Veleva] In your view, does a Macedonian nation exist, and 
who created it? 
  [Kostadinov] So far four uprisings have shed rivers of blood 
for the Macedonian nation and the Macedonian state. You should 
ask our ancestors whether they were a nation of puppets of 
various foreign propaganda. The Macedonian nation was born at 
the same time as the Bulgarian one -- at some time in the 12th 
or 13th centuries, or so I have read. You did not give us our 
letters, nor teachers, nor books and culture, and you borrowed 
your language from us. We now want to save this region from 
becoming a second Bosnia. 
  [Veleva] What were the nationalities of Cyril and Methodius, 
Kliment Okhridski, Gotse Delchev, and Yane Sandanski? 
  [Kostadinov] They were all Macedonians, no question of it. 
It is ridiculous to say that Gotse Delchev was a Bulgarian. 
Our grandfathers remember him. You must have read Peyo 
Yavorov's memoirs. You suggest Yane Sandanski was a Bulgarian? 
That is preposterous! What can we say about this? 
  [Veleva] From where does your organization derive its funds? 
  [Kostadinov] Let the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] and 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] say where they get their 
millions and their fine technical equipment from, let the 
Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization [VMRO] say how it 
is financed, and then ask me this question again. We get our 
finance from companies. We are now entitled to ask the 
Bulgarian Government for money. 
  [Veleva] Why does your program include the words "withdrawal 
of the Bulgarian occupation forces from Macedonia"? 
  [Kostadinov] What do you mean, why? We know that in 1912 
Macedonia was divided between three states. If Macedonia had 
been Bulgarian, then Bulgarian politicians would not have dealt 
with it the way they did; if it had been Greek, the Greeks would 
now be offering us a helping hand. The same goes for the Serbs. 
Macedonia represents spoils of war for Bulgaria, and the more 
territory we annex, the more of our country we will lose, and 
the sooner we will start a war to grab more territory. 
  [Veleva] Why do you constantly talk about possible 
bloodshed? 
  [Kostadinov] The propaganda is leading toward this. 
Relations are deteriorating. You should give up this 
propaganda and grant us our rights.

editorial intervention.)

<F P=106> [Genka Markova commentary: "Whose Should Initiative Be?] </F>
  [Text] Trying to conceal the fact that there is 
essentially a cabinet crisis is not only a moral issue, but also 
an affair of state. The unpleasant thing is that in such cases 
the curtain falls by itself and then the public notices the fact 
that the main political actors are nude, long before they 
themselves realize it. They are helpless as children in the 
present situation. The leaders of the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
[BSP], for example, unanimously plead with Professor Berov to 
return to his post as soon as possible. Performing medical 
miracles they try to make the public believe in the political 
revival of the cabinet, which long ago exhausted the formula of 
its formation as a result of its insolvency. Naturally, the BSP 
will do this only until the moment it serves its interest, and 
in any case not before an agreement with the international 
finance institutions is signed, something which will serve as 
the main claim of the Socialists in the forthcoming elections. 
  As far as the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] is concerned, 
the present situation is another gift from heaven. The question 
is how will the SDS utilize it. After the 15 March meeting of 
its National Coordinating Council, the SDS called upon the 
president to begin consultations with the political forces. 
  What could one expect from such a proposal? First of all, 
after the recent attacks on the presidency the proposal is more 
than an admission of the president's role in political life. 
The idea to begin consultations with the political forces is 
the best way of finding a solution to the current crisis, which 
soon will develop from a cabinet into a parliamentary crisis. 
The increasing fluctuation of deputies from one faction to 
another will only prepare the ground for this development. 
  Our society is talking about new elections. Now someone 
should take the initiative, which will produce practical 
results. The five no-confidence proposals failed, but now the 
situation is rather different. Deputies of the New Alliance for 
Democracy categorically stated that they will not support the 
cabinet. Deputies from other factions, including the BSP, will 
most probably do the same. Now is the moment for the SDS to 
assume the initiative. Instead of waiting for the president to 
do the job of all other political factors in the country, the 
SDS now should propose a formula for beginning political 
consultations. Today this means a readiness to assume 
responsibility.

  [Text] A meeting of the Defense Ministry leadership 
reportedly took place on 18 March. It was chaired by Defense 
Minister Valentin Aleksandrov and attended by deputy ministers 
of defense, the chief of the General Staff and his deputies, and 
the commanders of the Armed Forces branches. 
  The elimination of duplicating units in the Ministry of 
Defense system was one of the items on the agenda discussed at 
the meeting. 
  In this connection the minister of defense ordered that his 
personal chancery and the general chancery of the Ministry of 
Defense should be closed down. A chancery of the Ministry of 
Defense was established instead. Colonel Engineer Konstantin 
Seizov was appointed chief of the new chancery. He is the 
former chief of the general chancery.

<F P=106> [Article by Dorina Baesu: "The SRI Director Settles </F>
Accounts"] 
  [Text] The conflict between Virgil Magureanu [director of 
the Romanian Intelligence Service, SRI] and his deputy did not 
start yesterday. At about this time last year, information was 
circulating in political circles to the effect that Dumitru 
Cristea was trying to make contact with various opposition 
leaders -- and not only them -- to point out to them that he 
might be a good SRI director, better than Virgil Magureanu. Had 
they accepted the suggestion, it would have provoked a scandal 
following the discussions on the SRI report in the parliament 
and they would have had to vote against Virgil Magureanu's 
confirmation in the position. Cristea even met with some of 
those opposition leaders, while others avoided any contact with 
him, seeing it as a trap, and did not wish to get involved in 
private, internal SRI scandals. In those days there were even 
rumors about how Virgil Magureanu had dismissed Dumitru Cristea. 
  However, this did not happen because Cristea fought hard for 
his position. Slowly, slowly, after having been confirmed in 
his position, the SRI director removed from their positions 
those people who were supporting his deputy. General Gheorghe 
Diaconescu, the head of the counterespionage service, was one of 
them, and now even Cristea's turn has come. 
  Sources close to the SRI director affirm that Gheorghe 
Diaconescu was not removed from office because he was involved 
in the Pancea affair but simply because he was an incompetent 
person and a hard drinker. As far as Dumitru Cristea is 
concerned, the same source affirms that he was also involved in 
leaking information to a known extremist magazine. According to 
our source, published texts in that magazine that were signed 
Al.I. Manescu, were edited by somebody who is a professional in 
the field of information, namely, former General Neagu Cosma. 
For a while he was putting out the magazine 
"Espionage-Counterespionage," which he was writing almost 
entirely alone, and whose style very much resembled the 
aforementioned items in the extremist magazine.

<F P=106> [Article by Ana Maria Vintan: "It Is Increasingly Difficult </F>
With Oliviu Gherman"] 
  [Text] About this time last year, the ruling party [Social 
Democracy Party of Romania, PDSR] was waving the banner of the 
coalition government, which should have united all political 
forces in a brotherly embrace. Now the same tune is being sung 
again, but this time in a little more pragmatic manner, 
allegedly to break the current parliamentary bottleneck, which 
is becoming increasingly unpleasant for the PDSR leaders. 
  Nothing is being done now, just as nothing was done then, 
for 
the simple reason that there is no desire for any action. A 
member of the ruling party leadership told us a few days ago 
that under the current circumstances it is impossible to 
establish a PDSR-opposition government. The strongest 
explanation for this is the danger that the PDSR might split as 
a result of such a government. "There are too many of those who 
oppose such an alliance to allow us to disregard their wishes. 
The main promoter of this opinion is none other than Adrian 
Nastase, the executive president of the party. He is afraid of 
an alliance with the opposition not because he is a member of 
the conservative wing of the party but because he is a very 
cautious man, even excessively cautious. However, in politics, 
one also needs courage to assume certain risks." Adrian Nastase 
does not want to take any risks. He believes that it is too 
dangerous to break off with former allies merely for the sake of 
the opposition. Even though on diplomatic channels he is 
constantly receiving signals that confirm the wish of the West 
that the opposition should participate in the government. 
  Because of his obstinacy, Adrian Nastase's relations with 
the 
honorary president of the PDSR, Oliviu Gherman, have 
considerably deteriorated of late. He would be ready to take 
risks and has already succeeded in convincing even Ion Iliescu 
about the importance of showing greater courage in politics. 
  Gherman's latest disappointment is that it is that same 
Adrian Nastase who has recently saved a well-known extremist 
leader. Afraid that sacrificing this extremist leader would 
bring about isolation and the loss of certain faithful allies, 
PDSR Executive President Adrian Nastase made every possible 
effort and definitively eliminated the danger that seemed 
inevitable for the leader.

  [Text] A meeting of the presidents, vice presidents, and 
other representatives of the Social Democracy Party of Romania 
[PDSR] branches from 16 counties in Transylvania and Banat took 
place in Cluj-Napoca today. The meeting was attended by PDSR 
Executive President Adrian Nastase, other members of the Central 
Executive Bureau of this political group, members of the 
governments, and PDSR senators and deputies. 
  At a news conference after the meeting, Adrian Nastase said 
that the PDSR meeting is indicative of the party's concern with 
Transylvania and its problems. He emphasized that his party has 
its own position on the issue of national and interethnic 
relations. After enumerating certain conclusions he has reached 
during his discussions with the economic managers in the county 
and with the command of the 4th Army of Transylvania, Adrian 
Nastase referred to the meeting's main message, which is that 
the PDSR wants to enhance its positions throughout the country, 
including in Transylvania, thus rejecting regional approaches to 
solving problems and favoring the promotion of a policy in 
accordance with the norms of social- democracy and with the 
requirements of our country's geostrategic environment. 
  Adrian Nastase said that Transylvania's problems should be 
tackled from an angle indicative of the fact that, generally 
speaking, it is up to the country's government to find solutions 
to these problems, while the political parties should not play a 
mediating role. Selective and biased historism should be 
replaced by European standards, while the governmental and state 
dimension should play a greater role in tackling Transylvania's 
problems. 
  Adrian Nastase said that PDSR's image should be improved and 
its identity as a party clearly brought to the fore. In 
conclusion, he said that it is important to unequivocally define 
the relationship between the PDSR and the Democratic Union of 
Hungarians in Romania [UDMR], particularly since there are 
certain UDMR positions that are incompatible with the country's 
Constitution and we are faced with a certain ambiguity promoted 
by this party. 
  After his speech, Adrian Nastase answered the questions of 
journalists for more than an hour. Among the issues raised, we 
would like to mention the following: the local relations between 
the PDSR and other parties, particularly the UDMR and the 
Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR]; the discussions conducted 
by the ruling party with the opposition parties and with the 
parties of the governmental arch; and the problems facing the 
young generation and ways and means for their resolution. 
  Answering a question about early elections, Nastase said 
that 
PDSR considers them a mistake, since they would block the 
economic and political mechanisms, something which would have 
serious consequences at the domestic and foreign level, our 
correspondent Adriana Olteanu reports.

  [Text] A meeting on setting up the group of mayors and 
deputy mayors of the Civic Alliance Party [PAC] took place in 
Timisoara today. The goal of setting up this group -- as a 
party organizational structure, without legal status -- is to 
ensure the support of the locally elected representatives of 
this party by the central party leadership and the county 
branches, so as to enable them to optimally carry out their 
activity in town halls and to implement PAC policies in the 
sphere of local administration. 
  A communique released by PAC announces that the meeting was 
attended by PAC President Professor Nicolae Manolescu, members 
of the Steering Collegium, parliamentarians, 47 mayors and 
deputy mayors, vice presidents of county councils, and the 
presidents of the party's county branches. 
  In conclusion, the meeting endorsed and released an appeal 
to 
the citizens of the localities administered by the PAC 
representatives as well as a statement of the Group of PAC 
Mayors and Deputy Mayors. The statement points out that the 
local autonomy proclaimed by Law 69/1991 of Romania's 
Constitution has never taken effect. The disastrous situation 
of the country's localities, which are devoid of sources of 
income, is mainly due to the constant blocking of a package of 
laws of utmost importance for the normal functioning of the 
local councils. The statement draws the attention of the 
leadership of the Local Public Administration Department on the 
negative effects of this obstructionist policy, which is mainly 
felt by the population. The statement also stresses that the 
group of PAC mayors and deputy mayors will constantly promote 
the idea of the need for legislation to facilitate real local 
autonomy. The group considers it as its duty to appeal to all 
national and international forums capable of influencing the 
policy of the current government. 
  In conclusion, the statement expresses the conviction that 
their colleagues from other parties or with similar political 
viewpoints will join the efforts of the PAC mayors and deputy 
mayors.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 22 (TANJUG) -- Greece is in 
possession of information that the United States is preparing to 
open military bases in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
(F.Y.R.M.) and hastily building bases in Albania, as part of 
preparations for possible NATO operations against Serbia, the 
Belgrade daily VECERNJE NOVOSTI writes on Tuesday, citing Greek 
sources. 
  The United States is hastily building its military bases and 
adapting airports near the ports of Valona and Durazzo in 
Albania, which is a part of the U.S. plan to form its militacy 
satellites in this region. The second part of the U.S. plan is 
to form military bases in the F.Y.R.M., Yorgos Harvalias, editor 
of the Greek pro-government paper ELEFTHEROS TYPOS says. 
  Harvalias claims that Americans have sent logistics experts 
to the F.Y.R.M. to restore a former Yugoslav Army base at 
Krivolak so its could accommodate some 5,000 troops. 
  The Americans need bases in Albania and in the F.Y.R.M. if 
they engage in fighting Serbia as NATO operations require two 
fronts. The mountainous region between Albania and the Serbia's 
southern province of Kosovo and Metohija does not permit of 
waging a war with infantry but from the F.Y.R.M. territory it 
would be much easier because second front is opened in this way, 
Harvalias stresses. 
  Albanian separatists in Kosovo and Metohija have attempted 
for decades to secede this Serbian province from the Yugoslav 
Republic of Serbia and joint it to neighbouring Albania. To 
achieve this aim, they are using conventional terrorist methods, 
launching attacks on members of the army and police. 
  Over the past year, provocations on the Yugoslav-Albanian 
border and illegal incursions into the territory of the F.R.Y. 
are frequent. 
  The Krivolak testing range is the best equipped military 
testing ground in Europe and the former Yugoslav Army invested 
enormous funds in it, Radovan Kecojevic, the foremost Yugoslav 
military expert for explosive devices and pyrotechnics, whose 
knowledge and innovations are appreciated around the world, says. 
  The configuration of Krivolak's terrain is such that a 
1-kilo 
watt nuclear bomb can explode on it with no adverse effects for 
the environment, Kecojevic told VECERNJE NOVOSTI on Tuesday. 
  A total of 322 U.S. troops, as part of the U.N. 
peacekeepers, 
are currently in the F.Y.R.M., and a possibility of bringing in 
additional troops is considered so that the Scandinavian 
peacekeeping contingent, currently in the F.Y.R.M., could be 
re-deployed in Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gligorov and Soros Held Press </F>
Conference"] 
  [Text] The American businessman and founder of the Open 
Society Fund George Soros arrived in Skopje yesterday, as 
announced. He emphasised his 4 million dollars aid for 
Macedonia is aimed to alleviate losses resulting from the Greek 
embargo. Mr. Soros met with top-level politicians in Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and with 
parliament groups' representatives. Yesterday afternoon he had 
a meeting with President Gligorov, followed by a joint 
press-conference. President Gligorov underlines Mr. Soros' 
contribution and his readiness to help at these difficult times 
in Macedonia. We have very useful discussions, Gligorov said, 
primarily on the embargo and possible ways to endure it, as well 
as on the media in Macedonia, possibilities on more frequent 
programs on minority languages, etc. 
  Soros condemned the embargo in front of the press, warning 
against a possible wider conflict in the region to involve 
neighbouring countries, unless the embargo is lifted. Those are 
the reasons, he explained, Macedonia presently needs economic 
aid to survive. 
  Asked by Greek paper "Elefterothipia" whether he would send 
a 
letter to UN mediator Cyrus Vance in the same way Athens did, 
President Gligorov answered positively. Mr. Soros stated he had 
not had an did not plan any contacts with the Greek government 
at present.

<F P=106> [Interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic by </F>
Christophe Lamfalussy in Brussels on 22 March: "The European 
Union Must Keep Its Promises"] 
  [Text] [Lamfalussy] Minister, you are going to meet with 
Andre Adam, director general of policy at the Foreign Ministry. 
What is the nature of your visit? 
  [Jovanovic] So many things worry us: The Yugoslav crisis, 
the unjust and artificial isolation in which we have been placed. 
  [Lamfalussy] In practice, you want the sanctions to be 
lifted? 
  [Jovanovic] The European Union (EU) must keep its promises. 
It was it which proposed the peace plan to us. It asked the 
Serbian side to fulfill the conditions. And they have been 
fulfilled. It promised us that it would start to lift the 
sanctions. And we have been waiting for several months. Hoping 
that its promise means something. If not, its credibility in 
the negotiations will be greatly affected. 
  [Lamfalussy] There is still an impression that Serbian 
Bosnia 
and Serbia are the same... 
  [Jovanovic] Our influence on the Bosnian Serbs has limits. 
When three of our presidents went from Belgrade to Pale last 
year, they were humiliated. Their prestige suffered as a 
result. The Bosnian Serbs have been living there for a thousand 
years. They know their rights better than us. If they feel 
that we do not support them, they are ready to tell us to go to 
the devil. 
  [Lamfalussy] What is your influence on the Serbs in Krajina 
who are opening negotiations with the Croatian Government this 
Tuesday? 
  [Jovanovic] We cannot tell them what agreement they must 
sign. We can tell them that the hostilities must end, which is 
what we are saying to the Croatians too. 
  [Lamfalussy] What is your feeling? 
  [Jovanovic] We must return to the self-determination which 
was guaranteed by the last federal constitution of Yugoslavia 
and the penultimate Croatian Constitution. Croatia was defined 
as the state of the Croatian nation and the Serbian nation. 
When Mr. Tudjman came to power, his first action was to revise 
the constitution and reduce the Serbs to a minority. Until 
their rights are restored, there will not be much room for a 
compromise. 
  [Lamfalussy] In one country which would be Croatia? 
  [Jovanovic] It is possible if they reach agreement. 
  [Lamfalussy] Is the agreement signed in Washington by 
Croatians and Muslims another sign of hope? 
  [Jovanovic] God willing. It may be a hope, but it may also 
be dangerous. It will all depend on the American vision. Do 
they want a just and lasting peace? Or do they want to 
humiliate the Serbs? 
  [Lamfalussy] Mr. Redman has visited Belgrade... 
  [Jovanovic] He only gave broad outlines. The Americans are 
not telling us openly what they want. That makes us suspicious. 
  [Lamfalussy] One guarantee for peace is the control which 
you 
have over the war criminals, Arkan for instance... 
  [Jovanovic] Arkan only carried out one escapade in two years 
without our knowing about it. He was invited by the mayor of 
Bijeljina [as published] who wanted to oppose a mini-coup d'etat 
by the Muslims. We have never accepted the atrocities committed 
by him or by other parties. But in a civil war, there is no 
room for angels.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dara Vucinic: "Patriotism in the Budget"] </F>
  [Text] We have always known this: The people can go 
without, the army cannot. Patriotism, therefore, is measured by 
expenditure on the military budget. That is why recently in the 
Yugoslav assembly, not only the Socialists but also experts and 
politicians from the Democratic Party stated decisively: We 
shall vote for this proposal for the federal budget only because 
it is a military one. Fair enough! Things are what they are. 
Of the planned 1,674 million dinars, 1,264 million dinars, or 
75.5 percent, of the budget has been allocated to military 
requirements. That is the way to go: Our army -- is that not 
so? -- has always been the surest guarantee for the maintenance 
of our homeland and its (unknown) borders. 
  However, a few days ago the owner of a private business 
spoke 
out, saying that he was no less patriotic than those who 
proposed the federal budget, but since he was personally 
contributing a sizable amount to the military budget, he would 
like to know "what the people will be getting out of the 100,000 
soldiers and 100,000 policemen?" After all, the citizens must 
get something in return, perhaps beatings and more beatings.... 
Because, God forbid that the authorities could be thinking that 
it is in the interest of the taxpayers to fill the coffers of 
the army and the police to the maximum, while at the same time 
making only minor contributions to the coffers allocated to 
diplomatic activity, to which the government allocated precisely 
39 million dinars. Really. Will it be the generals or the 
diplomats who will pull us out of the crisis? Taxpayers, 
particularly owners of private businesses, have begun to ask 
this out loud. Perhaps in vain. Because this is not the United 
States, where people pay taxes, but under the motto: "No 
taxation without representation!"

  [Text] Belgrade, Mar 22 (TANJUG) -- According to data of 
the U.N. War Crimes Commission, at least 55,000 war crimes have 
been committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, TANJUG 
has learnt at the Information Center of the Serbian Council 
(ICSC) on Tuesday. Most of these crimes were committed against 
Serb civilians in Croatia, the ICSC said. 
  It is estimated that a lot more crimes have in fact been 
committed because, according to a statement of Chairman of the 
U.N. War Crimes Commission Cherif Bassiouni, not all rapes have 
been reported nor have all mass graves been investigated. 
  Many crimes are still undiscovered, especially in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, where fierce 
Moslem-Croat clashes have been underway for already a year and 
the conflicting sides have been accussing each other of 
intentional destruction of settlements, massacres of civilians 
and torture of prisoners. 
  The commission of U.N. experts for war crimes on the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia, set up two years ago on the 
basis of U.N. Security Council Resolution 780, has not managed 
to carry out the expected investigation but has only managed to 
gather documentation. 
  As the commission's mandate expires on April 30, it will not 
[words indistinct] in eastern Slavonia, on the territory of the 
Republic of Serb Krajina, which has been planned for April 10. 
  The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 in Serb ancestral lands in 
the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia in response to Croatia's 
violent secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and its 
attempt to downgrade the Serbs to a national minority. 
  On March 20, Croatia sent a protest letter to U.N. 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali claiming that the 
commission was "discontinuing work" and that this was "sabotage 
against the investigation on the principal war criminals," a 
description reserved by the Croatian propaganda for Serbs. 
  Zagreb had intentionally falsified facts because, above all, 
the commision was not discontinuing work but its mandate was 
expiring and thus the task it was entrusted to do was being 
wrapped up regardless of the fact commission had carried it out. 
  Besides, due to financial and technical reasons the 
commission postponed the beginning of the investigation. 
Croatia thus gained time and with the expiration of the 
commission's mandate, managed to avoid an international inquiry 
into the deaths of the victims buried on its territory. 
  "We have reliably established that there are 87 graves where 
murdered Serbs have been buried in Croatia," an ICSC official 
Vojin Dabic told TANJUG and added that the Serb side had 
undisputable evidence for this. This evidence was recognized zy 
the commission's secretary Julio Baez, during his visit on March 
10, he said. 
  Dabic added that the ICSC has reliable information that 
Croats have ploughed over some graves on their territory, such 
as the one in Pakracka Poljana in western Slavonia, ahead of the 
arrival of U.N. commission experts, in order to hide traces of 
the crime. That is precisely why we have to find out where the 
remains of the Serb victims have been moved, he said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Milan Mijalkovski: "Partnership for Discord"] </F>
  [Text] The United Nations is generally seen as the most 
significant international organization in charge of the 
preservation of peace and security in the world. Since the two 
world wars started in Europe, and the Cold War between NATO and 
the Warsaw Pact was most palpable in Europe, in 1973 the CSCE 
was founded in Helsinki to prevent possible cataclysms. Ever 
since, the CSCE member-countries (the European countries, the 
United States, and Canada) have been working systematically to 
strengthen mutual trust by solving problems in three domains 
(security, economics, and humanitarian aid). Without 
diminishing the importance of the last two, security is still 
the most important, because it clearly puts member-countries 
under an obligation to observe the established principles with 
regard to international affairs, particularly in terms of 
supplying information and making it possible to view the 
condition and activities of their armed forces. Intense 
negotiations on disarmament were crowned by the Vienna Document 
in 1990, by which Soviet military dominance (and power) in 
Europe was eliminated. Before that, at the CSCE meeting in 
Paris (from 19 to 21 March 1990) the Charter for a New Europe 
was adopted, which announces the cessation of the Cold War and 
presents the conceptual arrangement of future relations in 
Europe. The violent disintegration of former Yugoslavia and a 
war whose end is still not in sight best show to what extent the 
CSCE member-countries have stuck to the Charter (it does not 
anticipate the possibility of war breaking out). 
  The dynamics and character of the political and military 
processes in Europe in the course of 1990 created the illusion 
that finally a time of peace and well-being had come about. 
However, some significant facts were overlooked, which warned 
of the evidently misjudged situation. The facts are: Nobody 
mentioned that NATO should be dissolved, although there was no 
more need for its existence; NATO was rejoicing over victory 
against its main opponent, that is, the Warsaw Pact, and 
ignoring the warning of a USSR official that something horrible 
would come about with the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact -- NATO 
would remain without an enemy; the Warsaw Pact member-countries 
naively believed that they would be swamped with the capital of 
the rich West; German unification was underestimated, while some 
vital goals and interests of Russia were disregarded. 
  Therefore, inexplicably, the role of the CSCE since 1990 has 
been pushed into the background. There is a good chance that 
NATO might take up the role of the CSCE, because the steps that 
are being taken these days point to that possibility quite 
clearly. Of course, that possibility has primarily to do with 
the expansion of NATO, which is the plan that NATO is trying to 
camouflage with the "Partnership for Peace" project. Many facts 
indicate that it will be a cause of more discord in Europe 
rather than peace. 
  The essence is in the following: NATO was formed to keep the 
Russians out of, the Americans in, and the Germans subdued in 
Europe. The first task has been accomplished, but the second 
and the third are still facing many difficulties, the cause of 
which is to be found in the smoldering rivalry between the 
former boss, NATO (or rather the United States), and the new 
rival, Germany. These two, guided by the knowledge that the 
open rivalry between them at an inconvenient moment might have a 
negative effect on NATO's cohesion, have opted for a detour, 
which is to say, they are trying to preserve the Alliance (the 
United States), and to ascend to a dominant position (Germany) 
at the expense of the Eastern European countries, and in such a 
way to postpone the moment of direct confrontation. 
Consequently, under the pretext that NATO wants to help its 
former enemies, the United States and Germany have started a 
massive humanitarian mission in the East, of course only to 
accomplish their own goals and interests. Even this covert 
conflict may have a certain negative impact on NATO's cohesion. 
However, there is no doubt that the Eastern European peoples 
will be the ones who will eventually suffer and pay the highest 
price. 
  And what has actually happened? Just as in the past, the 
aggressive Germans have shown their proneness to hasty actions. 
By putting pressure on the European Community and the United 
States to recognize unconditionally the forceful secession of 
Slovenia, Croatia, and thereafter the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Germany scored the first points among the allies. Of course, 
with that Germany only announced its global aspirations. They 
became evident in 1993, when Germany signed agreements on 
military cooperation with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, 
Slovakia, and the former Soviet Baltic republics. 
  The fact that German military circles make decisions on all 
the important questions regarding the system of defense and the 
armed forces of the Czech Republic is a reliable indicator of 
what kind of agreements that it is all about (partnership should 
mean reciprocity). Such colonial-like successes of Germany in 
the East have caused skepticism on the part of the United 
States, while patriotic forces in Russia have felt that as a 
direct offense. 
  A reaction ensued in a flash. The United States decided to 
legalize their colonial interests in some former socialist 
countries by launching the Partnership for Peace project, in 
which all the NATO member-countries are supposed to take part, 
and to act as a monolith, while it is well known that in Albania 
it is solely the U.S. advisers who have been placed at all 
levels of the Albanian state administration, and that important 
political decisions must not be made without their approval. 
  It is naive to think, let alone believe, that the United 
States and Germany can accept former socialist countries as 
equal partners in decision-making, be it with regard to military 
issues, or any other issues. The attitude that the partners 
will have a right to consult with NATO on whether there is a 
direct or indirect danger to their security shows more than 
clearly that the Partnership has nothing to do with partnership, 
but rather with the typical U.S. patronage toward former 
enemies. Moreover, how NATO assesses whether the security of 
their partners is endangered, and to what extent, can be seen in 
the following: The fact that every fourth Russian voter voted 
for Zhirinovsky, while every seventh voted for the Communist 
Party, is reportedly a very great danger that threatens Russia. 
However, despite this and other alarming facts, the former 
Warsaw Pact member-countries (in the so-called neuralgic zone) 
are still naively hoping that the NATO countries (the zone of 
prosperity) will accept them as equal partners and make fair 
plans for their future. 
  The implementation of this project, which was started 
without 
a clear vision of what the future European defense system should 
be like, will probably exact a very high price. Who will pay 
that price is hard to say at this moment. However, the 
determination of the main rivals within NATO to involve the 
former enemies in their struggle for power and dominance within 
the Alliance is already giving hints to whom the bill will be 
delivered. Therefore it is wrong to expect that such a process 
will have a positive impact on European security. It is more 
probable that Europe will be thrown back to the time when it was 
the arena in which world wars were triggered. Is not the NATO 
ultimatum to the Serbian republic a good enough argument for 
that?

  [Text] Belgrade, March 22 (TANJUG) -- President of the 
Yugoslav Republic of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic and Honorary 
President of the Communist Party of Greece Charilaos Florakis 
said here on Tuesday they believed that the Balkan nations, in 
accordance with their vital interests and interdependence, 
should strive towards development of mutual relations and 
constructive cooperation on an equal footing. 
  The two sides agreed this would be the best way to ensure 
prosperity of the Balkan peoples and guarantee them that their 
rights and interests would be implemented in peace and in 
conditions of goodneighbourliness and mutual respect, said a 
statement released by the Serbian president's office. 
  Stressing the importance of friendship and close ties 
between 
the Serb and Greek peoples, Milosevic said that "for Serbia and 
its citizens, the support and solidarity of Greece mean moral 
support and encouragement to put up with the pressure to which 
they are exposed." 
  A Greek parliamentary delegation headed by Florakis said on 
Tuesday in a meeting with Yugoslav Parliamentarian Borisav Jovic 
that a settlement of the crisis in former Yugoslavia should be 
sought only in talks between the warring sides without any 
external interference, and warned of the danger of the conflict 
spreading to the entire Balkan region. 
  The Greek delegation also said that the Greek people had 
nothing but praise for the Serb people's resistance to attempts 
by imperalist powers, such as the United States and Germany, to 
establish a new world order in the Balkans and zones of their 
economic and political influence in the region. 
  Jovic, who is chairman of the parliamentary foreign policy 
committee, said Yugoslavia was vitally interested in an end to 
all fighting, lifting of unjust sanctions and return to the 
international community. 
  In late May 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed tough 
sanctions on Yugoslavia for its alleged involvement in civil war 
in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina although no Yugoslav soldier 
has been fighting there. 
  Jovic also hailed Greece's support and aid it had been 
wholeheartedly rendering to the Serb people in this difficult 
stage in its history.

<F P=106> [Interview with Miljenko Dereta, vice chairman of the </F>
Serbian Civic Alliance movement, by Christophe Urbanowicz; date 
and place not given: "Spring Will Be Hot in Serbia"] 
  [Text] "During the winter it was [Serbian President] 
Milosevic who was stealing the show, this spring it will be us." 
So thinks Miljenko Dereta, producer and vice chairman of the 
Serbian Civic Alliance, an intellectual movement opposed to 
Milosevic's nationalist regime. In an interview with LE 
QUOTIDIEN, he explains the strengths and weaknesses of Serbia's 
democratic opposition. 
  [Urbanowicz] Today, Milosevic's power seems stronger than 
ever in Serbia. Do you share this opinion? 
  [Dereta] Milosevic's regime is in crisis, but very little of 
this crisis is visible. His Socialist Party won the elections, 
which he organized at an opportune moment during the winter, a 
traditionally festive period in Serbia. Milosevic stole the 
show in the winter, but in spring it will be us. And spring 
risks being hot because of the protest movements which will 
certainly manifest themselves. 
  Serbia's economy has been totally destroyed by the UN 
embargo. We were lucky this winter. The weather was very mild, 
which is why people, pensioners in particular, did not start to 
die of hunger. But on the social level, things are beginning to 
move. Recently high school students protested for the first 
time, during five days, their hostility to those in power. 
Civil society is gradually waking up. I believe that change is 
inevitable, it is merely a question of time. 
  [Urbanowicz] What are the strengths and weaknesses of the 
democratic opposition? 
  [Dereta] We have more weaknesses than strengths, obviously. 
We have neither Solidarity or Havel with which to confront the 
Milosevic regime. Apart from the absence of a dynamic and 
uncontested leader, one of our greatest weaknesses is the lack 
of unity. We could have had 14 more seats, with the same number 
of votes which we gained at the December elections, but the 
opposition was unable to present a common front, for reasons of 
personal ambitions of some of its leaders. 
  In theory, the democratic opposition constitutes the main 
force in Parliament. In the Assembly, this democratic 
opposition represents a total of 127 deputies, as against 123 
seats taken by Milosevic's Socialist Party (the DEPOS 
[Democratic Movement of Serbia] coalition: 45; the Democratic 
Party (DS): 29; the Serbian Democratic Party (DSS): 7; the 
Hungarian Party (DZVM): 5; and the Albanian Party (DPA): 2). 
  But this advantage is of little use because, in practice, 
the 
opposition is incapable of presenting a common front, for 
personal reasons. Example: A Milosevic man was elected in 
January as speaker of the Assembly with four opposition votes! 
Milosevic's phrase: "I have only 123 deputies, but the 
opposition will never have 127," clearly sums up the play of 
forces. 
  Another weakness: the media. It is very difficult for us to 
gain access to the official media, in particular television, 
which is almost entirely controlled by his men. The way 
Milosevic's regime stupefies people with manipulated information 
is a crime. Throughout the election campaign, Serbian Democratic 
Alliance President Vesna Pesic was unable to appear on the 
screen except at the legally obligatory presentation of all the 
parties. To our great dismay, the phantom Communist Union -- 
led by the Serbian president's wife, Mira Milosevic -- took up 
more TV time than the other democratic opposition parties. And 
this Communist Union exists only in the state administration and 
in the army, not on the political scene! 
  Our strength lies in young people, who are increasingly 
turning toward opposition movements. Our strength lies also in 
the experience which we are acquiring, for the time being at our 
own expense. Let us not forget that democracy in Serbia is just 
four years old. 
  [Urbanowicz] What do you intend to do to convince the 
Serbian 
hinterland, whose votes enabled Milosevic's Socialist party to 
remain in power? 
  [Dereta] We were shocked by the results of the elections in 
the Serbian hinterland. We did not imagine that the past 
weighed so heavily and that the fear of change was so strong. 
We underestimated the provinces; it was what happened outside 
Belgrade which clinched the election. Whereas Serbian city 
dwellers remain relatively well-informed with their four TV 
channels and numerous radio stations, rural Serbia is unaware of 
what is going on in the outside world. That Serbia does not 
read the newspapers. Sociologists are well aware that one 
Serbian in two is illiterate. There are more illiterate people 
in Serbia than in its Kosovo province, which has an Albanian 
majority. Our program is not well understood by this rural 
Serbia. 
  [Urbanowicz] You took part in the last issue of TEMPS 
MODERNES [title as published], devoted to "Another Serbia." 
What, for you, is this other Serbia? 
  [Dereta] Our electoral slogan was: "To live like normal 
people." Living normally, that is our objective, that means in 
a state governed by the force of law, in a market economy, and 
with respect for our neighbors, whatever their origin. None of 
these concepts are well understood in our country. The 
absurdity of our situation is that we are fighting for the 
arrival of normality and against being forgotten in the West, 
where we are almost completely ignored.

  [Text] The Washington agreement between the Croats and the 
Muslims in many ways resembles the Yalta [agreement]. It 
harbingers the division of the former Yugoslavia into western 
and eastern spheres of influence, but also opens another 
possibility, Vuk Draskovic said at the news conference of the 
Serbian Renewal Movement. Radovan Pantovic has the details. 
  [Begin recording] [Pantovic] Neither the West or Russia are 
in favor of a Yalta-like division. It is for Belgrade to decide 
whether it shall be Yalta or an establishment of a certain 
union, that is, a reintegration on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia, Vuk Draskovic says. If the first option is decided 
on, the Serbs in Bosnia will get international recognition, but 
will have to concede one-third of territories and will probably 
not be able to join Yugoslavia except in a confederal form. As 
an alternative to this arrangement, interpreting the Washington 
agreement Draskovic mentioned the possibility for the Serbs to 
join a federal or a similar union [savez] with the Muslims and 
the Croats. This would enable Serbian cantons to join a 
confederation with Serbia and Montenegro. If they join a 
federal arrangement with Croats and Muslims, considerably 
smaller territorial concessions would be demanded of the Serbs. 
The Serbian cantons would be equal users of all international 
funds for renewal and development of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serbia 
could also reckon with the economic aid that had been promised 
to Croatia for signing the peace, something that would mean the 
lifting of sanctions. In conformity with this, the Serbian 
Krajina would establish three-fold connections, and would do so 
as a state: with Croatia, the Serbian cantons in Bosnia, and 
Yugoslavia. 
  According to Draskovic's interpretation of the Washington 
document, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM] would also join a confederation with Yugoslavia in 
this case. Therefore.... 
  [Draskovic] The Serbian Renewal Movement is against Yalta. 
From the very beginning, as regards Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
Serbian Renewal Movement is in favor of a cantonal setup. The 
Serbian Renewal Movement favors this second solution. 
  [Pantovic] The Serbian Renewal Movement demands a firm 
international guarantee that the return of refugees to their 
homes would be secured. Draskovic condemned, as he put it, 
Belgrade's silence, because in his opinion, the fate of Serbs 
and the Serbian people must not be decided upon by the Pale top 
military political leadership alone. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, March 22 (TANJUG) -- Vuk Draskovic, leader 
of the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), said on 
Tuesday that the (Moslem-Croat) Washington agreement clearly 
indicated a possibility that former Yugoslavia be divided into 
two spheres of influence -- the Western and the Russian. 
  Speaking at a press conference in Belgrade, Draskovic 
compared o the agreement signed in Washington on March 18 on 
setting up a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
its subsequent confederation with Croatia with the 
Roosevelt-Stalin-Churchill verbal accord reached in Yalta fifty 
years ago. 
  Draskovic, whose party is among the strongest opposition 
parties in both the federal and republican parliaments said he 
was against any kind of Yalta agreements and in favour of 
economic, cultural and some form of political reintegration of 
war-shattered former Yugoslavia. 
  He said that Bosnian Serbs had the alternative to form some 
kind of federal ties with the Moslems and Croats, which would 
make Bosnia-Herzegovina a federation or an assymetrical 
federation of Serb, Croat and Moslem cantons. 
  After Bosnian Moslems and Croats in early 1992 voted for 
Bosnia's secession from the former Yugoslav federation, Bosnian 
Serbs proclaimed their own republic in their ancestral lands in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
  Draskovic said the Serb cantons could enter into a 
confederation with Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) or join a 
Bosnian federation, in which case they would not have to cede so 
much of their territories. 
  In the latter case, Yugoslavia could expect the lifting of 
international sanctions and the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) 
would establish trilateral ties with Croatia, the Serb cantons 
in Bosnia and with Yugoslavia. Moreover, he added, The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia would then almost certainly form 
confederal ties with Yugoslavia. 
  The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 in predominantly 
Serb-populated territories in Croatia in response to Croatia's 
violent secession from the former Yugoslav Federation. It was 
placed under U.N. control in March 1992.

  [Text] Knin, 22 Mar (TANJUG) -- Talks between the republic 
of Serb Krajina (RSK) and Croatia began amid tight security in 
the Russian Embassy in Zagreb today, but the delegations are not 
being led by Defense Ministers Dusan Rakic and Gojko Susak, as 
was envisaged, the RSK Foreign Ministry has announced. 
  The delegations are being led by the national security 
advisers to the heads of state of the opposing sides -- Generals 
Mile Novakovic and Hrvoje Sarinic -- because the RSK delegation 
learned only on arrival at the Russian Embassy that the Croatian 
delegation would not be led by Defense Minister Susak, but by 
Sarinic. 
  In this situation the RSK delegation nominated General 
Novakovic as head of its delegation, and demanded that in the 
event of the signing of an agreement the person signing (for 
Croatia) should be Susak. 
  Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian deputy foreign minister, 
informed Krajina's delegation of this change just before the 
beginning of the negotiations. The RSK delegation told Churkin 
of its dissatisfaction at UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] action 
which prevented the arrival of Krajina journalists in Zagreb, 
but also because "it failed to keep its word regarding the 
composition of the Croatian delegation."

  [Text] Belgrade, 22 Mar (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic, president 
of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], told Belgrade Radio's 
Channel One this afternoon that the Serb side is not satisfied 
with the course of today's negotiations in Zagreb and that the 
Croatian side is trying to impose a solution by threat. 
  Martic said the RSK delegation in Zagreb has informed him 
that the Croats are insisting on the disarming of the Serb 
forces, which the Serb side "certainly cannot accept." He added 
that the Serb delegation will stay at the talks despite this and 
will use all possibilities to establish peace. 
  The Serbs went to the talks with the objective of bringing 
the hostilities to an end and reaching an agreement on the RSK 
territories which are occupied by Croatia. 
  "Whatever the developments, we cannot go below our our 
minimum principle, the principle of self-determination. We have 
our parliament, our government, the president. They were 
legitimately elected in the latest elections. Our people 
certainly cannot and will not allow our territory to be returned 
to Croatia," Martic said.

  [Text] Our colleague Dragoljub Stankic reports on the 
reaction in Knin to the events in Zagreb: 
  [Begin recording] [Stankic] All information arriving via 
satellite links between the government seat here and the Russian 
Embassy in Zagreb are received with great attention here in 
Knin. So far, there have been few reports and all that we can 
say now is that the Krajina delegation landed at [Zagreb] Pleso 
airport aboard an UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] helicopter at 
0930. With tight security measures, they arrived at the Russian 
Embassy at 1000. At the meeting with the Russian president's 
special envoy, Vitaliy Churkin, the head of the Krajina 
delegation expressed discontent with the composition of the 
Croat delegation. Namely, the Croatian side is not being led, 
as was agreed, by Gojko Susak, but by Hrvoje Sarinic. 
  While the first results of the negotiations are awaited, let 
us say that President Milan Martic is currently holding a 
meeting with his closest associates. We, however, have asked 
Djordje Bjegovic, chairman of the caretaker government, to say 
something more for Belgrade Radio about the draft agreement that 
is most probably being discussed in Zagreb. Is this a new 
agreement, or is it something that has now been seen for the 
first time in these regions? 
  [Bjegovic] First of all, I think that it is most important 
to say that the good thing is that peace is being discussed. 
Certainly that this first stage regarding the cease-fire and 
[word indistinct] signing such a document is the most important 
task, which should be regarded as a preliminary one. I think 
that what we may say in this situation is that there are no 
other agreements apart from corresponding modalities in a 
section of the line of separation. This part of the job should 
be documented with corresponding plans, that is, maps that would 
certainly verify this line of separation, so that one knows what 
we are talking about. The agreement, as a text, has never been a 
problem. The problem lay in the deployment of forces and 
certainly in the most important part of the job, the one that 
ensures peace, so that the artillery can finally be moved and 
thereby opportunities to shell one position from another are 
removed. I think that, in this situation, this is extremely 
difficult. 
  I think that the other aspect is most important. I think 
that, as the Croatian delegation has already changed its 
composition, it is impossible to expect anything to be signed in 
such a situation. The most important thing to say in the present 
situation is that our delegation is in Zagreb for the first 
time, and I think that, in this case -- let us express it in a 
sportsman's way -- we now have the white pieces [as in chess] 
and I am sure that this part of our cooperativeness will be 
(?appreciated) by the world. 
  [Stankic] One more question: The negotiations are being 
held in the Russian Embassy, at the Russian initiative, and with 
Vitaliy Churkin, special adviser to the Russian president, 
attending. What can you tell us about the Russian role in all 
this? 
  [Bjegovic] Well, you know, Russia [words indistinct] plays a 
relevant role. I think that at this moment, their role is much 
more specific than it was a year ago. The job that Russia wants 
to complete is exactly of the kind that we may expect, with a 
far greater level of security, to reach results, than was the 
case in the past. However, I can also say in this situation 
that this is not the time for us to be too optimistic. I would 
be happy if the Russian representatives would now exert their 
influence in an (?equality) way, that is, if they would exert 
their influence in the [word indistinct] stage, which now means 
the cessation of hostilities. Therefore, not partially, but 
(?completely). 
  [Stankic] Mr. Bjegovic, thank you for this conversation. We 
are going to report again when we have new information. [end 
recording]
