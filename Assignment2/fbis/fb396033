<F P=106> [Interview with Milan Martic, president of the republic of </F>
Serbian Krajina, by Dragoljub Stankic in Knin on 22 March -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Stankic] Could you give us the first comments on 
the negotiations in Zagreb so far? 
  [Martic] Well, we left for these negotiations with a clear 
aim. First of all, to establish a halt of [changes thought] to 
stop all hostilities, therefore, to establish peace, then to 
decide about the territory that has been temporarily occupied by 
Croatia in the January aggression in 1993 and in September. We 
also wanted to talk about the dumping of nuclear waste on the 
territory of western Slavonia, which is also occupied at the 
moment. 
  As things stand so far, I think that we cannot be satisfied 
as talks have taken another direction. Croatia obviously wants 
to impose itself on our delegation there with a degree of 
threat. It says that (?these are the stands) of both the United 
States and Russia, something that we do not believe. As our 
delegation in Zagreb reported to us, the Croatian delegation is 
now demanding that all our formations disarm themselves and the 
like. We certainly cannot accept that, but we will still remain 
at the negotiations to take advantage of all opportunities to 
reach peace. 
  [Stankic] What do you think about these demonstrations that 
are now held in front of the Russian Embassy in Zagreb? We 
heard new reports: There are a lot of people there who are 
demonstrating. 
  [Martic] I consider that to be a method of pressure on our 
delegation so that, under this horrible pressure, they would 
give in and sign that paper. However, the people from our 
delegation are firm, stable, and know exactly to what limits 
they can go and why they have left. Nobody, including them, can 
sign something like that. 
  [Stankic] [words indistinct] all kinds of pressures on the 
Serb delegation and obviously this pressure on Serbs. It seems 
that this is how they would treat the Serbs in Croatia if they 
remained in a sort of autonomy. 
  [Martic] Well, you have both asked the question and provided 
the answer yourself. 
  [Stankic] Finally, let us say what your expectations are? 
How will these negotiations end? 
  [Martic] Well, I nevertheless expect Russian diplomacy to 
take more initiative here and to really comply to what it said 
when it invited us to go to the Zagreb negotiations and that is 
to establish all hostilities [as heard]. 
  [Stankic] Let us return once again to the negotiations in 
Zagreb and the Serb side's platform. This is the problem of the 
occupied regions in Krajina and the problem of western Slavonia. 
  [Martic] As for the occupied territories, the answer is 
known. We have had agreements before, when Croatia signed that 
it would withdraw from the occupied territories, but they soon 
refuted all the agreements they signed and have not respected 
them. 
  [Stankic] How do you, Mr. President, see the final solution 
in these regions? 
  [Martic] I expect that, in future, we shall hold 
negotiations at the International Conference on the former 
Yugoslavia. I expect us to find solutions there. However, 
whatever direction the situation may develop, we cannot go lower 
than our [word indistinct] and that is the people's right to 
self-determination. We have a parliament, a government, and a 
president and these are legally elected institutions [words 
indistinct]. We also have the people, who certainly will not 
and cannot allow our territory to be returned to Croatia. 
However, we shall allow this last referendum to be held before 
the international public -- the people should express its own 
will about with whom it wants to live. We cannot withdraw from 
this principle of self-determination.

  [Text] Cease-fire negotiations between the Croatian 
Government and rebel Serb authorities in the protected areas are 
to resume on the 29th of this month. The talks were adjourned 
about 1230 last night, after 13 hours. The most difficult 
points were details of how to implement the cease-fire and to 
disengage forces on the ground. 
  According to HINA, all the participants were optimistic, and 
the Russian special envoy, Vitaliy Churkin, described the 
situation as favorable for reaching an agreement. The American 
ambassador stated that the countries involved in the talks 
firmly support Croatian integrity, but the problem must be 
solved by peaceful means. The leader of the Croatian 
delegation, Hrvoje Sarinic, said that the fact that the talks 
would resume next Tuesday spoke for itself. He added that he 
was optimistic about reaching a solution next week.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, March 23 (TANJUG)--Head of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) office in Zagreb Veljko Knezevic 
said it was a "political interest of the F.R.Y. to normalize 
relations with Croatia." 
  He told TANJUG Wednesday prior to leaving for Zagreb that 
people wished normalization of relations with all Yugoslavia's 
neighbors, especially with Croatia because the situation there 
was most complex. Knezevic stressed that Croatia behaved 
differently on the international scene as opposed to bilateral 
contacts. 
  The Yugoslav office in Zagreb was opened on the basis of an 
agreement the foreign ministers of F.R.Y. and Croatia signed on 
January 19 this year in Geneva. The office of Croatia in 
Belgrade was to be opened soon. 
  Speaking about the first round of talks between the Republic 
of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) and Croatia in Zagreb on Tuesday, 
Knezevic said that normalization between Knin and Zagreb would 
surely contribute also to normalization of relations between 
Belgrade and Zagreb. 
  "It is very important that the talks are to be continued," 
assessed Knezevic and emphasized that "normalization and 
political solutions of problems between the R.S.K. and Croatia 
would be one of the decisive factors for pacifying the situation 
in the entire territory of the former Yugoslavia." 
  The problem of the R.S.K. was one of the pressing issues in 
settling of the Yugoslav crisis. The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 
1991 in parts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia with 
predominantly Serb population in response to Croatia's forcible 
secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and reducing the 
status of the Serb people from a constituent people to one of a 
national minority in the new state. 
  The subsequent armed clashes between the R.S.K. Serbs and 
the 
Zagreb authorities, which do not recognize the R.S.K., resulted 
in a decision to declare the R.S.K. a U.N.-Protected Area (UNPA) 
in the spring of 1992 until a political settlement was reached.

<F P=106> [News conference by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman with </F>
domestic and foreign correspondents in Zagreb --live] 
  [Text] [Tudjman] On return from our visit to the United 
States and the United Nations, I can say that Croatia--and I, 
personally--can be more than satisfied with the results of the 
talks that I had with the most senior statesmen of the United 
States -- President Clinton, Vice President Gore, and Secretary 
of State Christopher. Members of the Croatian delegation--[Mate] 
Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, [Defense] 
Minister [Gojko] Susak, Minister (Jeren), Minister Jasic, and 
Vice Governor Rogic--also had talks with their counterparts and, 
as a whole, the talks with the highest-ranking representatives 
of the U.S. Government were fruitful and signified the creation 
of a basis for lasting, friendly cooperation between Croatia and 
the United States and for a partnership with the United States. 
  I believe that you must know a great deal by now about the 
agreements that we have signed, the agreements on a 
Croat-Bosnian Muslim federation and the confederation of a 
federal Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. This event was 
described not only by our hosts but also by international 
diplomatic circles and the United Nations as an event of 
historical significance, as a watershed in the efforts to 
resolve the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, and as a resolute 
step toward peace. 
  The talks I had at the United Nations with Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali and all his aides and, in particular, my 
speech in the Security Council--which met with Madame Albright, 
the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations in the 
chair--were for us of great significance. During the course of 
these talks with both the UN secretary general and his aides 
and, in particular, in the Security Council, it became evident 
that Croatia's stands were enjoying support from almost all the 
Security Council members -- Argentina, Brazil, New Zealand, 
Great Britain, Russia, the Czech Republic, and so forth. Like 
U.S. statesmen and all those we talked to, they also paid 
tribute to Croatia and its steadfast, determined, and sensible 
policy and reiterated their support for Croatia's territorial 
integrity. Both President Clinton and the Security Council 
members stated emphatically that, for their part, they would do 
their utmost to ensure that the UN Security Council resolutions 
were implemented and that the Croatian territories under the 
control of the peace forces and under Serb occupation--and it 
was the first time that U.S. representatives and the Security 
Council spoke in those terms--were reintegrated in Croatia's 
constitutional and legal system as soon as possible. 
  Understandably, during the course of this, everyone was 
appealing for this to be done peacefully while, on their part, 
they will bring pressure to bear--by way of sanctions and in 
other ways--on Serbia and Yugoslavia so that they renounce 
occupation and accept a solution. During the course of these 
talks on the new mandate, I presented Croatia's views that we 
could accept, that we accepted, the extension of the UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] mandate on the condition that some 
guidelines for the implementation of the Vance plan and UN 
Security Council resolutions were laid down. 
  In this context, I drew attention to the importance of the 
implementation of Resolution 769 on border controls between 
Croatia and Serbia and between Croatia and those areas in Bosnia 
that are under the control of Serb forces and to the disarmament 
of Serb paramilitary formations. Without this, there can be no 
peace. I also drew attention to the beginning of the return of 
refugees and, lastly, the gradual restoration of infrastructure 
facilities, communications, oil pipelines, and power lines. 
  In this context, we were met with understanding, so we can 
expect the UN Security Council to pass resolutions to this 
effect. They understandably may be gradual. Perhaps they may 
not include everything at once. It is essential, though, that 
we have a political climate today in which there is full 
understanding for Croatia's views. All in all, this visit has 
consolidated and reinforced Croatia's international 
position--both by way of our alliance, our partnership with the 
United States in its capacity as the superpower that plays the 
main role in modern international developments, and within the 
framework of the United Nations. 
  I would like to stress, in particular, another important 
event-- the opening of the Croatian Embassy in Washington and my 
meeting with Croatian emigres--those emigres who made it 
possible with their hands, their financial contributions, and 
also with their work--for us to have one of the most beautiful 
buildings, one of the most beautiful embassies you can find 
there. Many people worked there. They came from distant parts 
of the United States--from New York, Cleveland, from other 
parts. They travelled for long hours and worked all day 
throughout their weekends so we would get a building that can 
make us proud indeed--we as the Croatian state, the Croatian 
people in the United States. 
  This was a touching meeting with our people, both in our 
embassy and particularly later on at the opening ceremony at the 
embassy, which was attended by about 1,000 people. Some of our 
ministers could not get in because they arrived late. 
  All in all, this is yet further proof of the unity of the 
homeland with emigrants from Croatia. The embassy was purchased 
by us in the homeland, but both money and work have been 
contributed by our emigrants. This is evidence both of the 
unity of the homeland and of emigrants from Croatia and of the 
pride of our Croatian people in being able to do something for 
their free, democratic Croatia. 
  It was really nice to be in Washington and New York and 
return to the homeland with the feeling that we have 
strengthened the international position of Croatia and that the 
problems facing us can now be resolved more successfully, with 
fewer difficulties, and in a more resolute and rapid way. 
  That is enough by way of an introduction. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [words indistinct] of Deutsche 
Welle. Mr. President, every time the UNPROFOR mandate expires, 
local rebel Serbs are ready for talks and agreements. It has 
been demonstrated that nothing has come of these agreements so 
far, and this time their representatives will come to Zagreb 
when the UNPROFOR mandate expires. Do you bring with you--after 
your trip to Washington and meeting with Butrus-Ghali--any 
guarantees that things will be different this time? What would 
be the very latest deadline for refugees to return to their 
homes? 
  [Tudjman] Clearly, the current talks are taking place in 
different circumstances, in altered conditions with regard to 
the efforts to resolve the crisis in former Yugoslavia as a 
whole, in Bosnia, and--by implication--in Croatia. The 
guarantees you mentioned lie in the fact that top U.S. statesmen 
and--as I said before--those in the United Nations, have stated 
emphatically that they will support efforts to reintegrate the 
Croatian territories now under Serb occupation into our 
constitutional and legal system as soon as possible. 
  Just like us, the world also wants this problem to be 
resolved in a peaceful way. That it would be better to resolve 
it in a peaceful way was made clear to us in Washington during a 
meeting with a group of Croatian people. There I met a man, a 
young man, with no arms -- I shall do everything to make sure 
that there are fewer of these victims. But, understandably, the 
opponent will soon realize that we are prepared to use all means 
available if we fail [to reduce the number of victims]." 
  As for the return of the refugees, we would like this to 
happen instantly. I told the Security Council that we could not 
accept the proposal to extend the mandate for another year, 
another 12 months, but that we could accept it only for another 
six months--provided that the refugees be allowed to start 
returning to their homes during that time. 
  This, of course, is a complicated process; however, with the 
support that we have in the world currently, I think we will be 
able to initiate and finalize it in a way that suits our people. 
This is not just an issue of Croatia's sovereignty and its 
territorial integrity, but it also reflects the justified desire 
of our refugees. They must begin preparing for it. Although we 
will try and avoid unwise steps, it is justified to expect the 
refugees to begin preparations to return and to let the world 
know that this is what they insist on and that it cannot be 
denied them--that it is a justified demand that must be met soon. 
  [al-Isa] Mr. President. Nada al-Isa, Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Radio and TV and the state agency Bosnia Press. When are you 
going to visit Sarajevo? Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency 
President Izetbegovic said at a news conference yesterday that 
he had invited you. I would like to know whether you intend to 
accept the invitation and visit Sarajevo? Has world 
diplomacy--or Croatian and Bosnian diplomacy--performed a 
miracle? Rumor has it that Parliament Speaker Mesic was advised 
roughly two months ago not to pay a return visit to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly President Miro Lazovic. 
  [Tudjman] First of all, who did advise him? One should not 
enshroud this question in any kind of politicking. I have 
accepted Mr. Alija Izetbegovic's invitation, and I would like to 
visit Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina very soon. 
  [Perasovic] Zeljko Perasovic, GLAS SLAVONIJE. Mr. 
President, when will the normalization of relations with the 
so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia take place? Or in 
other words, why has Veljko Knezevic [Serbian ambassador to 
Zagreb] not come to Zagreb yet? Do you have any information 
about this? 
  [Tudjman] Yugoslavia's representative, Knezevic, has already 
been in Zagreb. Whether or not he has come back, I do not know. 
The process of normalization was initiated by the opening of 
representative offices. It will probably continue despite those 
who would like to thwart this normalization. There are, 
understandably, unreasonable people everywhere. I believe that 
the Croatian- Bosniak-Muslim agreement on creating a 
Croatian-Bosniak-Muslim federation and a confederation of a 
federal Bosnia with Croatia must have a positive influence on 
the Serbs, to the effect that they accept normalization, that 
they realize that if they do not accept it, that would be even 
more detrimental to them. 
  Consequently, despite everything that stands in the way of 
this normalization, I believe that normalization will 
nevertheless take place. There will, of course, be difficulties. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, do you 
anticipate the possibility of a peace agreement in the talks 
today with local Serbs in the Russian Embassy? 
  [Tudjman] I do not understand. An agreement? 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you anticipate the 
possibility of an agreement with local Serbs in the negotiations 
in the Russian Embassy today? Is there the possibility of an 
agreement with the local Serbs in the negotiations? 
  [Tudjman] I have already answered that question. Regardless 
of the fact that there will be haggling and difficulties, I 
believe that neither the local Serbs nor Belgrade have any 
option but to accept the road to normalization. 
  [Saracevic] Saracevic, German radio. Mr. President, 
according to the Croatian press, you said in an interview you 
gave to Reuters TV that Bosnian Serbs would be given the 
possibility of forming a confederation with Serbia if they were 
to enter the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation--if they join it. 
Were you given any indications to make this assumption? Does 
this mean that the state, or rather the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
federation, would be part of two confederations--of the 
Croat-Bosnian confederation with Croatia and Bosnian-Serb 
confederation with Serbia--if this does happen? Is this not 
slightly illogical, or does this mean the division of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state? 
  I am asking if this--and this is connected with the 
so-called 
Krajinas here in Croatia--would this mean changes in the 
borders? If this is the case, it would, in my view, threaten 
Croatia's borders as well. Can you elaborate? Thank you. 
  [Tudjman] First, the two issues--the resolution of the 
Bosnian issue and of the Croatian territories under the control 
of the peace forces and under Serb occupation--have nothing in 
common in that the question of whether Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
resolved on a confederal or federal basis has no effect on how 
the issue of the Croatian territories is resolved. 
  Three constituent nations are at issue in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
while the Serb ethnic community in Croatia is a minority that is 
not entitled to the right to self-determination under any 
international conventions, regulations, or common law. These 
areas have always been part of Croatia and never part of 
Yugoslavia or Serbia. In other words, there is no need to link 
this issue, except in that it will also be affected by the 
military and political resolution of the crisis in former 
Yugoslavia. It will not, however, be affected in the sense that 
any potential changes in Bosnia-Herzegovina will inevitably 
imply similar changes in Croatia. 
  I do not know what it is that you read and Reuters wrote 
but, 
in any case, I did not say that the situation could develop in 
such a way that the Serbs would be allowed to join a Bosniak 
Muslim-Croat federation and to set up a confederation with 
Serbia--or rather Yugoslavia--at the same time. On the 
contrary, I said that something of that kind was inconceivable, 
but that at some stage it could happen that the events unfold in 
the future in such a way that the part of the territory declared 
a so-called Srpska republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina--in other 
words, the part of the territory under Serb control--will be 
allowed to set up a confederation with Serbia, or rather 
Yugoslavia, and the Bosniak Muslim-Croat part with Croatia. In 
other words, this is not the case of a double or simultaneous 
confederation. 
  Then there are speculations that, in some way, all this is 
an 
attempt to restore Yugoslavia. This is out of the question. 
There can be no solutions that are unacceptable to either the 
Croatian people in Bosnia or to the Croatian state. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Even well-intentioned friends 
abroad have been harboring suspicions regarding the 
implementation of this agreement signed in Washington, 
particularly because no time frame has been laid down for this 
transitional period. What is your view of the possibility of 
problems arising during the course of implementing this 
agreement? Do you know, or can you tell us in more detail, how 
long this transitional period will be? 
  [Tudjman] Please tell us on whose behalf you are asking. 
Please always say who you represent. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I am a representative of the 
KUNA news agency of Kuwait. 
  [Tudjman] I do not know what kind of speculation you are 
talking about. A transitional period is inevitable at any rate. 
How long it will be depends, understandably, on all kinds of 
things, so it is hard to predict anything. By all means, both 
our Western allies and ourselves will strive to make this period 
as short as possible. 
  [Curic] Jozo Curic, Croatian TV. Mr. President, we have 
started talking about what follows next in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Can you tell us now about the military agreements that have 
been signed and about your reports on the situation on the 
ground? What is your view of further developments on the 
ground? Are we waiting for the Serbs to decide or not, or else 
can the Croats and Muslims already do something by themselves? 
  [Tudjman] As you can see, the Croats and Muslims are 
already working on their own. The world finds it surprising 
that the cease-fire between the Muslims and Croats has taken 
effect, that there is no longer any warfare, that they are 
exchanging prisoners. Even we ourselves can be satisfied in a 
positive sense and accept these developments. Consequently, the 
consolidation of Croat-Muslim relations is underway. What lies 
ahead for them as well as for international factors is to 
persuade the Serbs to accept a solution that would also bring 
about an end to the war and a political solution. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, Beic, Croatian 
Radio. As far as your visit to the UN headquarters, and 
particularly your presence at the session of the UN Security 
Council, is concerned, you pointed out on behalf of Croatia 
several essential elements for the continuation of UNPROFOR's 
mandate. One of these essential elements is the deployment of 
UNPROFOR troops along Croatia's internationally recognized 
borders. I would like to know what the UN Security Council's 
answer is, particularly regarding the future mandate and the 
next term. How does the UN Security Council view this 
proposition of yours? Thank you. 
  [Tudjman] I first made this demand in talks with the UN 
secretary general and his aides; they showed understanding and 
promised to review this demand, likewise the Security Council. 
Naturally, this demand includes authorizations to UNPROFOR in 
order for them to implement it. On my part, I voiced the 
opinion that there was no need to boost UNPROFOR's numerical 
strength but that its activities should be redirected towards 
controlling points that can be controlled, that is, the border 
between Croatia and Serbia on the Danube and in eastern 
Slavonia, in Srijem and along the border with Bosnia. I also 
pointed out that NATO's air support ought to be forthcoming if 
these forces are threatened or prevented from controlling these 
borders. This will be examined and the Security Council will 
decide on the new mandate. 
  As we now have a favorable political climate, this is of 
great importance for resolving not only the UN-protected areas 
but the crisis in former Yugoslavia as a whole, and we expect 
the Security Council to be responsive in determining the new 
mandate and to take steps that would empower UNPROFOR to 
implement the Vance plan and all Security Council resolutions, 
especially resolution 769 concerning border control, and 871 
which is all-encompassing. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, Mate [name 
indistinct] of VECERNJI LIST. Reporting on the meeting at the 
Russian Embassy in Zagreb, Belgrade Radio said this morning that 
the Western powers have agreed in principle that Baranja should 
be given to Serbia in exchange for Krajina and peace. What 
could you tell us about this? 
  [Tudjman, laughing] Agreement in principle, whose agreement 
in principle? Well, you know that people sometimes tend to make 
plans without consulting those concerned, in any case, even 
dreaming that we might agree to such negotiations is out of the 
question. As far as the talks at the Russian Embassy go, in 
addition to Russian representatives I believe that U.S. 
representatives will also be taking part, at my proposal. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [name indistinct] of VJESNIK. 
Mr. President, has there been any mention in the Pentagon about 
Croatia's joining NATO, and will Croatia be granting NATO 
certain locations -- Vis and Lastovo, for instance -- for use as 
military bases? 
  [Tudjman] Good God, would you like to discuss military 
secrets here? [laughs] Understandably, the talks centered on 
all issues of interest to Croatia and of interest to our 
collocutors. Croatia will receive support for access to the 
Partnership for Peace, while all the rest is a question of 
mutual interest and, as I said -- military secrets -- but what 
is important is this: Croatia needs allies and we have found 
them, we have them. And Croatia, as it is, is of interest to 
the most important international factors, including the United 
States. This is what we are basing our policy on. This is 
exactly what we have achieved with our consistent policy -- we 
now have allies and these allies need Croatia, they count on it. 
They count on it not only in the quest for peace but also in 
the establishment of the new international order in the region 
of former Yugoslavia and in southeast Europe. 
  [Ramljak] Olga Ramljak, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. At the beginning 
you mentioned unity between the Croatian homeland and the 
diaspora. In the meantime, while the agreements were being 
signed in Washington, the media reported on demands from the top 
state and party level for the resignation of Defense Minister 
Gojko Susak because he allegedly disagrees with this policy, or 
else because there is suspicion that he will not implement it 
correctly. Today, we have a civil initiative, a public protest 
following the arrival of Serb negotiators in Zagreb, under the 
slogan: We do not want to negotiate with war criminals. What 
is your comment on these cases in view of your statement that we 
will now be resolving our problems quicker and more resolutely? 
  [Tudjman] We have thus seized opportunities to resolve them 
quicker and more resolutely [as heard]. The demands that 
Minister Susak should be sacked did not come from the top state 
level but from individuals, from politicking schemers. These 
demands will be subject to political assessments and, 
understandably, they will not change the state policy. Being at 
the helm of such an important ministry, Minister Susak had my 
full trust. Not only did he enjoy trust in his leadership of 
the Defense Ministry but also amid Croatia's precarious position 
when we had to extend our support to the Croat people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, first against the Serb aggressor so we could 
secure the survival of people there [sentence as heard]. 
  Consequently, these demands can be raised by those who 
disagreed with this policy or those who are doing this for 
personal reasons. Not only are there always politicking schemers 
in politics but there are also people who have different views 
on some individual issues or different demands. Everything, 
however, eventually fits in its place. 
  As regards the protest you mentioned, I do not know about 
it. 
I can imagine there are such people. One should not talk to 
war criminals provided they were not there, or if we could bring 
them to justice or send them to the moon, so they would not 
exist [as heard]. Even representatives of the European Union 
[EU], official representatives of the EU and official 
representatives of the largest European powers, and even the 
main superpower, the United States, negotiate with them. 
  Mr. Redman, President Clinton's personal special envoy, 
visited not only Zagreb but Belgrade too. It is not only 
representatives of Russia who talk to them but those of the 
United States and Europe, too. Consequently, we too are forced 
to talk. Moreover, we are willing to talk so as not to suffer 
further casualties. It is easy to be bellicose and say -- no 
talks. Let those people identify themselves so they can see, 
even before I started my journey there were 11 fatalities and 
some 30 wounded in one of Croatia's battlefields. We are not 
going to play either with human lives or with Croatia's 
interests because of someone's insanity. 
  I understand the rage of our people, as I share it too. But 
policies are governed by reason as well as by heart. 
Understandably, this is always the case, in history and at the 
end of all wars and during wars, one talks to one's opponents. 
We are in conflict with them and we should get out of this. 
Consequently, this is not simply some kind of will of ours or 
our weakness but, if you will, our strength as well, as a result 
or consequence of the overall international circumstances in the 
period from the collapse of Yugoslavia to this crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and, understandably, the problem of Croatia's 
areas under Serb occupation and UNPROFOR protection [sentence as 
heard]. 
  So, we will continue talking for as long as there is any 
chance. We have stressed and continue to stress that we have 
not given up the ultimate means if the talks fail. But then we 
have to have the support, to secure the support of the 
international circles and forces which are active in 
international organizations and have a decisive role in creating 
current international order. 
  [Skugor-Hrncevic] Smiljana Skugor-Hrncevic, HINA. Mr. 
President, during your visit to Washington another agreement was 
signed which was overshadowed by the political agreements. This 
is an agreement between Croatia and the United States on 
scientific and technical cooperation. Can you tell us a bit 
more about this agreement? Are there any concrete indications 
regarding aid and cooperation? 
  [Tudjman] The agreement on scientific and technical 
cooperation is one of the most important agreements. The amount 
available for Fulbright scholarships has already been doubled. 
Work is being done to extend cooperation into other fields. 
This is one of the agreements to be signed in various other 
fields [as heard]. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [name indistinct] DANAS. Mr. 
President, it is being rumored that some government ministers 
will be replaced. Is it only a government reshuffle or is 
Premier Valentic to leave? Can you say something about this? 
  [Tudjman] There will be no government reshuffle.

  [Text] Warsaw, 22 Mar--Forty-one percent of those polled by 
the Public Opinion Research Centre [OBOP] agreed with the view 
that the West betrayed Poland and the other Central European 
countries by refusing them immediate acceptance into NATO. At 
the same time, 79 percent of those canvassed by OBOP think that 
Poland should try to get into NATO. Seven percent were against 
this idea, and 14 percent had no opinion on the matter. 
  The poll was carried out from 4 to 6 February of this year, 
on a 1,015-person random nationwide sample of Poles over age 15. 
  Fourteen percent of those polled firmly agreed with the view 
on "betrayal," and 27 percent "were inclined to agree." Nine 
percent of those polled firmly disagreed with this formula, and 
27 percent "were inclined to disagree." Twenty-three percent of 
those polled had no opinion on the matter. 
  In the opinion of 52 percent of those polled by OBOP, Poland 
is a sovereign country; according to a further 36 percent, it is 
not, and 12 percent of those polled had no opinion on the 
matter. According to OBOP, these results do not differ from a 
similar poll carried out in March of last year. 
  Forty-two percent of those polled think that entry into NATO 
will happen in several years' time, and 23 percent in a dozen or 
so years. In the opinion of 6 percent of respondents, entry 
into NATO will happen inside a year or two; the same percentage 
stated that it would never happen. The youngest respondents 
were the most positive on the chances of rapid acceptance into 
NATO. 
  Sixty-eight percent of respondents had heard of the 
"Partnership for Peace" program, and 31 percent of them 
expressed interest in the idea. Two-thirds of this group think 
that the partnership proposal will increase Poland's security, 
and one-quarter are of the opposite opinion.

<F P=106> [Article by E.K.: "Prime Minister Gave Assurances to </F>
Coalition; Dariusz Rosati Finally Accepted"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak is today expected to 
forward to the Belweder a motion requesting the appointment of 
Dariusz Rosati to the post of deputy prime minister and finance 
minister. 
  "We have received such an assurance from the coalition," 
said 
Aleksander Kwasniewski, following the Tuesday [22 March] session 
of the coalition's leadership. 
  As he was leaving the headquarters of the Polish Peasant 
Party, Prime Minister Pawlak merely stated that a press 
conference would be held on Wednesday. It can be expected, 
therefore, that he will officially announce the decision he 
reached yesterday. 
  Apart from the prime minister and the leader of the 
Democratic Left Alliance, also participating in the coalition 
meeting were Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy, Senate Speaker Adam 
Struzik, Deputy Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, Michal 
Strak, head of the Office of the Council of Ministers, and Jerzy 
Szmajdzinski, general secretary of Social Democracy of the 
Polish Republic. 
  One of the issues discussed was, among other topics, the 
report from the National Council of Radio and Television. 
  The coalition has not yet agreed on a joint position on this 
issue because not all of the deputies have had time to 
familiarize themselves with the council's report. 
  "Evaluation of the report calls for a serious discussion, 
which will be held at the end of April or the beginning of May," 
said Kwasniewski.

<F P=106> [Article by Z.L.: "Siemiatkowski to Defense Ministry; </F>
Whether Kolodziejczyk Has Changed His View"] 
  [Text] Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, a political 
scientist, a member of the Chief Council of the Social Democracy 
of the Polish Republic, a press spokesman for the Democratic 
Left Alliance [SLD], a Sejm deputy, a member of the National 
Judiciary Council, and a scholar at Warsaw University, will most 
probably be appointed deputy defense minister. 
  In accordance with the required procedures, Siemiatkowski's 
candidacy should be presented to the prime minister by the chief 
of the Defense Ministry [MON] Piotr Kolodziejczyk. Negotiations 
concerning a "reflection of the coalition arrangement in MON's 
civilian section" lasted several months, with some long breaks. 
All signs are that Minister Kolodziejczyk, who seemed to be 
unshaken in his conviction in the beginning and who was accused 
by the chairman of the Sejm National Defense Commission, Jerzy 
Szmajdzinski (SLD), of "speaking not with his own voice but with 
the Belweder's" regarding the coalition minister, changed his 
mind after all. It seems that Kolodziejczyk, who, until 
recently, categorically opposed "attempts aimed at placing a 
political commissioner in the ministry," has come to appreciate 
(under the coalition's pressure because he recently met 
Aleksander Kwasniewski, among others) the need to establish the 
post of under secretary of state, who would relieve him of the 
need to contact the parliament and would also be in charge of 
the military justice system. Last week, Siemiatkowski also met 
the MON chief. 
  We found out from circles close to the General Staff, which 
is the main commanding organ of the Armed Forces of the Polish 
Republic, that the Army's leadership cadre tends to take a 
distanced position on the skills of the new deputy defense 
minister, who so far has had little to do with the Army, except 
for his membership in the Sejm National Defense Commission. 
During a recent interview for our newspaper, General Tadeusz 
Wilecki, who is the chief of the General Staff, emphasized his 
disapproval of "attempts to adapt MON structures to specific 
people."

<F P=106> [Interview with Leszek Miller, labor and social policy </F>
minister, by unidentified reporters in Warsaw on the "Hundred 
Questions To..." program--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Reporter] Mr. Minister, you mentioned money. 
How much money do you specifically need, and how would you spend 
it? 
  [Miller] You know, of course I need more of it than I have 
right now, but I am happy that, at least when it comes to some 
items, I have more money than I used to. For instance, when it 
comes to active forms of combating unemployment, my ministry has 
almost 6 trillions zlotys [Z] at its disposal right now, whereas 
we used to have just Z3.5 trillion. That is an increase of over 
60 percent. So there are reasons for me to be happy with that. 
But, when it comes to social assistance, the situation is not 
as good there. The Z16 trillion that constitute the amount at 
the disposal of local governors will meet this year's needs at 
approximately the same level as last year. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] There is ever more talk of unfulfilled election 
promises that were made by the now governing coalition, even 
though only six months have gone by. When asked whether he will 
sign the budget, President Walesa said that, if he does decide 
to sign it, it will be with the reservation that society was 
treated with disregard once again, in the sense that something 
was promised to society, and it is being given something 
completely different right now. Are you to blame for that? 
  [Miller] Because you want to talk about election promises, 
let me remind you that there were all kinds of promises made 
then. For instance, our opponents from the election campaign 
used to say that, if the left wing wins, political isolation of 
Poland will follow. That did not happen. They also said there 
would be economic isolation, as well, that the West would turn 
its back on us. That did not happen, either. These opponents 
also said it is time to start buying vinegar in grocery 
stores--and, as far as I can recall, Mr. Borusewicz said he has 
already done that--because there will be nothing left in the 
stores. They also said one would have to introduce 
food-rationing coupons and so forth. So let us also confront 
these promises that were made back then. Of course, I am happy 
that these particular promises have nothing to do with the 
current reality. But what I would have to do is ask you 
[addressing the reporter] which specific promise you mean. If, 
for instance, you mean that we said that the level of the lowest 
retirement pensions and other kinds of pensions must be raised, 
the fact is that we did even more than what we promised because 
we said we would implement a 3-percentage-point raise effective 
1 January, but, when it comes to retirement pensions, the actual 
raise is 4 percent. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, I am not sure why, but there have 
been no questions so far on the strike situation. Do you plan 
on using force in the event of a general strike or if 
electricity is cut off from the building of the Council of 
Ministers' Office [URM]? There are such doubts in trade union 
circles. 
  [Miller] I cannot assume that a situation could take place 
where the URM building should be deprived of electricity because 
there are other ways of supplying it there. 
  [Reporter] But when it comes to a general strike? 
  [Miller] Of course, a general strike is a big danger, and, 
because you mentioned it, the current conflict with Solidarity 
is taking place kind of on two levels: The first level is about 
real social problems. After all, no sane person could say that 
there are no families for whom life is extremely difficult; in 
fact, the situation of many Polish families is indeed tragic. 
But the other level of the dispute is about an argument 
concerning the ways and methods of solving the conflicts. We 
cannot treat Solidarity any differently from all of the other 
trade unions. The previous government treated Solidarity in a 
privileged way, and then it was brought down by that very 
Solidarity. We cannot make the same mistake. We will be trying 
to establish such areas of negotiation that are based on equal 
treatment of all trade union centers. So, if Solidarity wants 
to force the government to treat it differently, the government 
will be in a very difficult position. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Are you not afraid of other kinds of dangers? 
After all, we had a debate on the budget in the Sejm, but the 
president does not have to sign the budget, anyway. It may turn 
out that a completely new situation will emerge. What will the 
coalition and you do then? 
  [Miller] Of course, Mr. President does not have to sign the 
budget, but the budget will be in force anyway because I am 
convinced that the Sejm would reject a presidential veto. That 
is because even those Sejm deputies who voted against the budget 
when it was being voted would vote against the president right 
now. Simply put, the Sejm will be aware of what it would mean. 
A nonrejection of a presidential veto would mean the Sejm's 
dissolution. I think that, if the president were to make such a 
move, the intention would be to have the Sejm dissolved. Well, 
the fact is that the Sejm will successfully defend itself 
against that. So I would simply urge Mr. President to just sign 
the budget. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Alicja Ogieglo: "Who Benefits From </F>
Privatization?"] 
  [Text] It is certain that Silesian Bank [BSK] employees 
are delighted that their bank has been sold, just as the work 
force of the Kwidzyn Paper Factory is pleased with the sale of 
its plant to the Americans. Kwidzyn workers used the money from 
the sale of their shares to take final leave of the old 
realities of People's Poland: They bought apartments, cars, and 
furniture. The crew of the Rafako manufacturing plant was 
slightly less ecstatic in the last stages of the sale of its 
enterprise because its shares did not make a profit as high as 
those of the BSK. In this context, what can the remaining 80 
percent of the Polish population say? So far, it has not had a 
chance to snatch for itself even a tiny part of the 
privatization profits. 
  At the same time, certain groups of politicians intend to 
capitalize on the prevailing public mood and hamper the progress 
of privatization while invoking the following maxim: "It is 
preferable to carry it out slowly--but methodically and fairly." 
Consequently, we will not see the issue of share certificates as 
early as promised by the National Investment Funds Act. If we 
did, might not pensioners and employees of the budget-funded 
sector, who were supposed to be the first in line to participate 
in and benefit from the Polish mass privatization program, get 
too rich for someone's liking? 
  A new problem, which was demonstrated clearly by new 
in-depth 
social research studies carried out in 1993, is posed by 
employees' growing discontent with working conditions provided 
by private enterprise owners. There is also evidence of 
increasing criticism of private owners based on dissatisfaction 
with other factors besides poor working conditions, such as 
management methods that undermine employers' dignity and 
irrational economic and organizational decisions. 
  The traditional mistrust of foreign capital and prejudice 
against foreign investors still persist, although, in practice, 
firms that have accepted foreign capital tend to reserve higher 
praise for it than for our own, domestic capital. Recently, it 
has been recommended that a system of public monitoring and 
control of the implementation of the privatization program be 
introduced on a regular basis. 
  To begin with, the Mass Privatization Program [PPP] was 
launched with a considerable degree of public approval (with a 
mean value of 70 percent, obtained in a number of separate 
surveys). It generated associated expectations of an economic 
miracle and elevation of wide circles of society into the elite 
realm of private property owners. Even after a notable fall in 
share values in 1993, the level of public acceptance of the 
privatization program was still relatively high. Consequently, 
the minister for ownership transformations continued to enjoy 
considerable public support. And so, once the Privatization Act 
was passed by parliament in April 1993, the PPP could have 
confidently "kicked off" on schedule. By now we would have been 
approaching the stage leading to mass distribution of and 
trading in share certificates. 
  First, the level of the PPP's public acceptance declined as 
a 
result of the election campaign. Even so, during Prime Minister 
Pawlak's "honeymoon" period, public approval for privatization 
still reached some 50 percent. At the same time, however, the 
proportion of advocates of the view that privatization should be 
carried out at a much slower pace than previously increased 
sharply (to 47 percent). Representatives of opinions that deny 
the sense of accelerating the privatization process do not 
expect to get rich themselves. In their view, enterprises 
should be sold exclusively to those buyers who will undertake to 
maintain employment levels (60 percent). 
  In addition, the predominant view is that privatization 
should start with enterprises that are in debt rather than with 
those in sound financial condition. Recent opinions stressing a 
growing degree of discontent with the effects of privatization 
to date influence politicians in their negative view on the PPP 
program as a whole. It is true that the recently appointed 
Selection Committee, whose creation already involved 
considerable difficulties, has set out on a course of talks with 
the firms that took part in the initial sales tender, but it has 
scheduled the completion of the selection process aimed at 
identification of parent companies and candidates to the 
position of members of National Investment Fund supervisory 
boards for the second quarter of this year. Meanwhile, 
enterprises that may even want to participate in the program and 
that would regard it as a move in their own economic interest, 
tend to attend more closely to matters of immediate importance, 
such as local and employee interests. At the same time, many of 
them suffer the consequences of a deteriorating financial 
condition. It seems that the PPP program has become a scapegoat 
here, as a victim of political maneuvering. Those who are 
responsible for decisions in this area are probably hoping that 
someone else will eventually pay for the consequences of the 
delay in the introduction of the privatization program.

<F P=106> [Article by Zbigniew Weglarek: "RP (Polish Republic) Stands </F>
For Risky Proposition"] 
  [Text] Although, according to Western experts' generally 
consistent opinion, Poland is the first country in Central 
Europe that has managed to halt the progress of deepening 
recession and begin a process of emerging from the crisis, it is 
still seen as posing a particularly high investment risk. This 
view is borne out by, among other things, an opinion survey 
commissioned by the Polish Development Bank [Polski Bank Rozwoju 
SA] and carried out by the Market Economy Research Institute. 
The former GDR, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary were 
chosen for comparison purposes. The Institute's respondents, 
selected from a number of Western firms conducting business with 
the former CEMA as well as international consultancy 
institutions, were asked to draw a ranking list arranging the 
above-mentioned countries according to, first, their importance 
in business relations (the market attractiveness factor) and, 
second, the degree of risk involved in placing investment in 
them. 
  Our place on the list is very high as regards the 
attractiveness of our market to foreign business. Using a 
five-point scale, the consultancy firms awarded 4.5 points to 
Poland (and, respectively, 4 points to Hungary, 3.5 points to 
the Czech Republic, 3 points to the former GDR, and 1.8 points 
to Slovakia). Business firms gave us a slightly lower rating 
(3.3 points), but, even so, we came before all of the other 
contestants. The next country on the list, Hungary, was 
allocated 2.5 points, the Czech Republic 2.4 points, the former 
GDR 2.2 points, and Slovakia 1.9 points. 
  A different picture emerged when it came to evaluating the 
risk factor involved in investing in our group of countries. 
The businessmen believe that Poland and Slovakia were leaders 
in the "high-risk" stakes. The international consultancy firms 
drew up a list with a slightly different order. They have the 
least confidence in Slovakia. However, Poland comes a close 
second to Slovakia. 
  Analyses carried out by the Market Economy Research 
Institute 
attempted to uncover the reasons for this particular ranking 
order, which is so unfavorable to us. Among other things, 
techniques developed in the West and adapted for use in our 
country were used to draw up a "sector map" designed to present 
a picture of the current levels of our enterprises' competition 
potential. The map comprises five sections. The first section 
lists industry sectors for which, in the present state of our 
economy, the risk of bringing in outside capital is considered 
to be "small"--in other words, those that promise relatively 
high profits, with an advantageous correlation of outlays to 
results. The second section of the map comprises "medium-risk" 
industry sectors; the third, "increased-risk"; the fourth, 
"high-risk"; and the fifth, "particularly-high-risk." 
  Startling as it may seem, from the economic viewpoint, the 
sectors listed as involving small and medium investment risk 
represent more than 50 percent of current industrial production! 
Another group of sectors, representing approximately 14.4 
percent of output, are relatively close to the potentially 
profitable zone, although they require appropriate 
efficiency-enhancement measures (the "increased-risk zone"). 
Sectors that have been described as representing high risk for 
potential investment and that thus promise many difficulties for 
firms that might decide to invest in them turn out approximately 
7.8 percent of our industrial production. Finally, sectors that 
constitute particularly high risk for potential investors and 
that, consequently, are at present the least attractive--or, to 
be more precise, that lag furthest behind others and thus 
threaten the hypothetical investors with many unpleasant 
surprises--represent slightly more than 27 percent of industrial 
production. 
  Among the sectors that already offer only small risk to 
investors are the herb industry, the match-manufacturing 
industry, the sugar industry, and the pharmaceutical industry, 
although the last requires a very high degree of specialist 
knowledge and experience. At the other end of the scale, very 
high risk is involved in investing in such sectors as the 
high-technology optical, aircraft, and computer industries, but 
also, among others, the potato-growing industry, the spirits and 
yeast-manufacturing industries, and the footwear industry, none 
of which, or so it would seem, present particular technological 
difficulties hard to master for any country with a relatively 
high level of technological and industrial advancement and 
expertise, and whose work force has at least moderate 
professional and technical qualifications. 
  Through an additional survey conducted among foreign 
businessmen and business consultants, the Market Economy 
Research Institute set out to ascertain the most prominent 
reason for anxiety concerning the potential involvement of 
foreign investment in the five countries listed above. In the 
case of the former GDR, for example, social tension gave the 
greatest cause for concern; in the Czech Republic, legislative 
and economic difficulties were listed as most worrying; in 
Slovakia, there was concern over economic problems; and, in 
Hungary, economic and social factors alike were found to give 
reason for anxiety. 
  In Poland, the chief risk factors are political instability 
and imperfect legislation. No other country of our group of 
five received even a comparably poor political rating from the 
potential investors consulted in the survey.

<F P=106> [Article by B.I.W. and P.W.R.: "OPZZ Demands Explanations </F>
From Prime Minister; Experts for Government and Solidarity Begin 
Their Work"] 
  [Text] A team of experts from Solidarity and the 
government, which is to deal with the demands of the trade union 
[TU], has begun its work. The chairwoman of the All-Polish Trade 
Unions Agreement [OPZZ] sent a fax to the prime minister in 
which she asked him to explain whether it is true that the 
Council of Ministers is supposed to accept or reject legal 
documents prepared by the experts. 
  "We absolutely reject the possibility of such a situation. 
We cannot have decisions that will be binding on everyone but 
that will only come out of government-Solidarity talks. We also 
have something to say here," Ewa Spychalska told RZECZPOSPOLITA. 
  Solidarity activists have been saying the whole time that 
the 
team of experts is supposed to deal with the trade union's 
demands, so that they may be referred to the government in due 
course. 
  "The experts will transform the demands into the language of 
legal acts, while the Council of Ministers will make the 
political decision whether to approve," Piotr Zak, a spokesman 
for the [Solidarity] National Commission told us. But the OPZZ 
rules out such a situation. 
  "My feeling is that there is a discrepancy between the 
information I received from the prime minister in our 
conversation and the way the media reported on the results of 
the prime minister's talks with Solidarity," OPZZ Chairwoman Ewa 
Spychalska said Tuesday [22 March], during a break in a session 
of the OPZZ Council's Presidium. 
  Spychalska is concerned about the fact that, according to 
media reports, the experts for the government and Solidarity are 
to work out legislative drafts regarding implementation of the 
trade union's demands and then submit them to the Council of 
Ministers for approval. 
  "That suggests a different procedure used by the government 
in its talks with my colleagues from Solidarity," Spychalska 
said. 
  The OPZZ chairwoman had been informed that all the experts 
were to do was to put the demands of Solidarity in a certain 
order and then refer them to multiparty negotiations within 
negotiating teams or within the Trilateral Commission because 
the "demands apply to all employees, not just to Solidarity 
members." So she sent a fax to the prime minister asking for an 
explanation. 
  "In every civilized country, differences are resolved within 
trilateral arrangements. Representatives of all trade unions 
must be partners for deciding issues that concern all 
employees," Spychalska said. She also added that, when it comes 
to a point where the government treats various trade unions 
differently, the OPZZ will make decisions on what to do next. 
But she refused to explain what kinds of decisions these could 
be, apart from saying that they will try to get the desired 
results "with every legally allowed method." 
  The OPZZ is waiting for the prime minister's decision 
regarding the activity of experts for the government and 
Solidarity. When asked to comment on the OPZZ chairwoman's 
doubts, Dariusz Jadowski, director of the Government's Press 
Office, only cited an excerpt from a joint communique issued 
after the Pawlak-Krzaklewski meeting: "Results of the prime 
minister's meeting with the chairmen of the Independent 
Self-Governing Trade Union `Solidarity' and other trade unions, 
like the results of the experts' work, will be presented to a 
session of the Council of Ministers and debated there." 
  --The following trade unions declared that they are joining 
the OPZZ: The Polish Bailiffs Trade Union and the 
Copper-Industry Employees Trade Union. The latter was a member 
of the trade union center as a member of the Miners Trade Union 
Federation, which it left along with the ZFFG [expansion 
unknown]. In December of 1991, the Copper Industry Employees 
Trade Union received the legal status of an all-Polish trade 
union. Ryszard Zbrzyzny, its chairman, headed a strike 
committee that conducted a 32-day strike in the KGHM SA "Polish 
Copper" in July and August 1992. According to Zbrzyzny, the 
trade union has 12,000 members. 
  --The Presidium of the National Commission of the 
Independent 
Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity" has issued an appeal to 
the Brown Coal National Section not to begin an active strike 
that was planned for 24 March and to wait until the strike 
headquarters issues a decision.

weapons. They opened barrage fire toward Marin Dvor from the 
direction of the (?Bosut) Barracks. Chetnik snipers also 
attacked the district of Dobrinja and Brekin Potok. One 
explosion of a cumulative mortar bomb was also registered. It 
was fired from [word indistinct] on Stup district. 
  The members of the United Nations Protection Forces came 
under fire from the aggressors' positions in Nedjarici again 
today. They responded in kind to the fire that came from Stup 
hill. This was reported by the Information Service of the 1st

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 23 March carries in its 
regular 7-minute newscast two reports on the fighting in the 
Bugojno and Bihac areas. 
  Correspondent Emir Avdakovic, reporting from Bugojno on the 
situation in the past 24 hours, says that "Bugojno is a 
veritable hell, as the city is pulverized by dozens of the most 
destructive howitzer and tank shells. From their lairs in the 
mountains encircling Bugojno, particularly from the direction of 
Kupres, the chetniks are continuing to shell the town. The 
fervor with which they are doing this is proportional to their 
failures in direct clashes with the members of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army who have courageously and effectively 
repelled the enemy's attempts at infantry breakthroughs, with a 
further 15 chetniks being killed in the process. I say further, 
because in recent clashes on the Bugojno front over 60 chetniks 
were killed. According to reliable information, chaos rules in 
their ranks. The members of the UN Protection Force's British 
Battalion stationed in Bugojno have witnessed all this. For the 
time being, they are silently observing from their armored 
personnel carriers the horrors that the citizens of Bugojno are 
being forced to endure. This morning the town was once again 
shelled and the general alarm remains in force." 
  Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports that "throughout 
the night, the Serbian aggressor used artillery and tanks to 
shell the Bihac and Cazin areas. The attacks were particularly 
fierce after 2300 and in the early morning hours, when they 
shelled the town centers and the roads linking Bihac and Cazin. 
The aggressor is obviously employing a new strategy of shelling 
civilian targets in those periods when there is less chance of 
NATO planes patrolling the skies over Bihac. The situation on 
the defense lines remains the same with the chetniks continuing 
their bestial attacks, alternating artillery and infantry 
attacks. Actually, there is not a single inch of the defense 
lines on the Grmusko-Srbljanksi plateau, Hasin Vrh, and 
Barakovac that has not been hit by several shells overnight and 
in the early morning hours. [Words indistinct] the Serbian 
aggressor has been sporadically attacking in the theater of 
operations of the Headquarters of the Croatian Defense Council 
on the Pljesivica part of the front, where snipers are 
particularly active this morning, while the area of Skoce has 
come under artillery attack. All the defense lines are firm and 
stable. [Abdic's] paramilitary forces have not been quiet 
overnight and this morning. They are attacking the defenders 
with all (?available means) in the areas of Krivaja, Leskovac, 
and Trs [words indistinct]."

  [Excerpt] There have been new artillery-infantry attacks on 
the defenders' lines on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, Hasin 
Vrh, and the Bihac part of the front. The hundreds of howitzer, 
mortar, and tank shells that have landed on parts of the defense 
lines and the shelling of Cazin, Bihac, and the surrounding 
areas this afternoon mark the 43d day of the Serbian aggressor's 
offensives on the Bihac region. 
  Our defenders are heroically resisting the wolves from Mount 
Ozren who have again arrived on the Bihac front. The fact that 
they used chemical agents in attacks today sufficiently 
illustrates the behavior by Karadzic's terrorists. When they 
failed to break the defenders' resistance, they turned against 
city districts. Substantial material damage was caused in Cazin. 
Some civilians were wounded, but fortunately no one was killed. 
  In addition, the rage by Abdic's paramilitary has continued 
in the border areas of the Cazin municipality. The targets of 
secessionists' attacks are the same ones they have been 
mercilessly destroying and torching since last night. They are 
also killing domestic animals and expelling people. A large 
number of refugees from these areas, especially from Krivaja, 
Liskovac, and (?Trzac), arrived in Cazin today. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Zagreb, March 22 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs have held up 
a convoy of humanitarian aid for the Moslem enclave of Maglaj in 
northern Bosnia for at least 24 hours, the UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR) said here Tuesday. 
  The convoy, which left the Croatian capital Zagreb on Monday 
morning, was forced to turn back the same day by Serbian forces 
controlling the bridge at Gradiska, which links Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, said UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler. 
  The convoy arrived back in Zagreb on Monday night and left 
again on Tuesday morning. It reached Gradiska again at noon and 
was undergoing checks, Kessler said, blaming the delay on 
"bureaucratic difficulties." 
  Bosnian Serbs on Saturday lifted a nine-month siege of 
Maglaj. 
  The town's population of around 25,000, plus up to 75,000 
others in the surrounding enclave, had been forced to rely on 
air drops for food since October. 
  He said he hoped the convoy would get to Banja Luka, the 
main 
town under Serbian control in northern Bosnia, in time to spend 
the night there before continuing its journey to Maglaj. 
  The convoy is made up of 30 trucks, 10 of them bound for 
Maglaj, and the rest for Banja Luka, Doboj, to the north, and 
Zenica in central Bosnia. 
  On Sunday, nine UNHCR trucks loaded with 80 tonnes of food 
and medicine managed to get into Maglaj without hindrance from 
Zenica, 70 kilometres (45 miles) to the south. 
  Bosnian Serbs gave the go-ahead the same day for the second 
now delayed convoy.

Provocative fire was again opened with infantry arms. One 
member of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina was wounded near 
Plocari in the Fojnica commune. 
  In the Bakovicaka Ciptonja region, the fighters of the HVO 
used incendiary ammunition and set ablaze the forest close to 
our defense lines. 
  Members of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] can confirm what 
the situation on the ground is. As the Information Service of 
the 1st Army Corps reports, our units are observing the 
cease-fire agreement.

<F P=106> [Interview with Presidency member Ejup Ganic by Renato </F>
Cemerika; place and date not given: "The Agreement Is Our 
Success"] 
  [Text] Until recently, Ejup Ganic did not hide the 
fact that he wanted the war to continue and that his dream was 
to conquer Vitez in order to round up the production program for 
equipping the Muslim army. With the intention of finding out 
whether he had changed his views, especially those on Croat 
relations, we asked him to comment on the preliminary agreement 
signed in Washington and to assess the possibility of 
implementing the agreement. 
  [Ganic] The agreement is a political success for the 
Presidency and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government, because we 
have been fighting against the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
from the very beginning. We started out together with the 
Croats against the Serbian aggressor, who not only wanted to 
divide Bosnia-Herzegovina but also conquer all of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and a large part of Croatia, but the creation 
of Herceg-Bosna -- Greater Croatia -- resulted in a conflict 
between the Croats and the Muslims. This agreement is necessary 
to preserve the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which the 
Bosnian Croats proposed at their assembly in Sarajevo last month 
and the Muslim -- Bosniak leadership -- in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
The success of the agreement depends on the Croatian side, 
especially the extreme part of the leadership from Grude. 
  [Cemerika] What about the extreme part of the Muslim 
leadership? 
  [Ganic] I think all Muslims are doing their best to preserve 
the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, regardless of their 
politics. 
  [Cemerika] Some Muslim generals do not believe in the 
political solution and they do not trust politicians. 
  [Ganic] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency -- that is, its 
president -- is the supreme commander of the army, and since we 
now have an organized army that gets its orders from its supreme 
commander, I do not believe that there are officers in our army 
who do not obey those orders. 
  [Cemerika] If this agreement with the Croats is successful, 
how will you arrange your relations with the Serbs? 
  [Ganic] Bosnia-Herzegovina is a country that belongs to all 
of its citizens, and every honest Serb has his or her place in 
that country. We will try to come to an agreement with those 
Serbs who still believe in the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
because the agreement with the Croats is not aimed against the 
Serbs. 
  [Cemerika] Has Izetbegovic authorized Silajdzic to make this 
agreement? 
  [Ganic] Mr. Silajdzic cannot sign any agreement without 
authorization from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency -- that is, 
its president, Alija Izetbegovic. 
  [Cemerika] If the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly rejects the 
agreement, will Mr. Izetbegovic also reject it? 
  [Ganic] We are a democratic country with a democratic system 
and the Assembly elected by the people, and if the Assembly 
rejects the agreement, then no one has the right to accept it, 
although I am sure it will be unanimously adopted by the 
Assembly. 
  [Cemerika] During our conversation, you have shown that you 
are in favor of a peaceful solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
However, you are famous for your "hard" views in your statements 
on solving the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem and you have advocated 
war more often than peace. Can you explain this change? 
  [Ganic] First of all, I did not make such statements and, 
second, every new event deserves a new comment. 
  [Cemerika] If a confederation between Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is formed, will you lose your position? 
  [Ganic] (laughter) There will be democratic elections!

<F P=106> [Report by Nada al-Isa from Zagreb] </F>
  [Text] Ivo Komsic, member of the Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, today held a news conference in Zagreb. Here 
is a report by our Zagreb correspondent Nada al-Isa: 
  [al-Isa] The first result of the Washington agreement is 
already evident, the clashes between the Croats and the Muslims 
have virtually stopped. This marks a turning point in general 
Croat-Bosniak relations. This was stated by Ivo Komsic, member 
of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, at a news conference in 
Zagreb today. However, the agreement is still only a preliminary 
agreement since the public, the people will have to express 
their view on it, Komsic said. He said that the Assembly of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will give its final word on the Washington 
agreement on 28 March. 
  The Bosnian Serbs should now be included in the 
negotiations. 
We should talk to them on the return of the occupied 
territories. The Serbs can join the federation, Komsic said, 
but parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina joining Serbia is out of the 
question. They can only take a bit of Bosnian dust, whatever is 
left on their shoes. 
  Asked to comment on the statement by Croatian President 
Tudjman at the news conference today that there is a possibility 
of a part of the so-called Srpska republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
joining Serbia, Dr. Komsic said that he did not know where Dr. 
Tudjman obtained this information, and that this was out of the 
question. 
  Komsic expects some difficulties in the implementation of 
the 
Croatian-Bosniak agreement, which could come from individual 
persons. The implementation of the agreement will be hindered 
by the same persons who artificially caused the Croatian-Muslim 
clash. 
  It would be interesting to see what the reaction will be 
here 
in Croatia to the statement by Dr. Komsic regarding the 
so-called Herceg-Bosna. Replying to the question as to what 
would now happen with the so-called Herceg-Bosna, Dr. Komsic 
said: Nothing, because it has never existed. Only the state of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has and will continue to exist. All 
artificial creations must completely disappear.

  [Text] The Washington agreement will be adopted by 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly in Sarajevo on 28 March. This 
was announced by Ivo Komsic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency and president of the Croat National Council of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bosiljka Bucan reports from the news 
conference at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Embassy in Zagreb. 
  [Bucan] Unlike other agreements on the resolution of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, the Washington agreement's clauses 
are precisely defined. They are, according to Ivo Komsic: 
  [Komsic] "At midnight on Monday Bosnia-Herzegovina will have 
its new constitution and will begin to live according to the new 
constitution. According to the new constitution elections 
should be held in six months. Until then the assembly will be a 
constituent assembly and will pass only one law -- the election 
law." 
  [Bucan] The Washington agreement is the basis for the 
resolution of the entire crisis. The Serb aggressor side can 
reject or accept the agreement. If they accept, they would have 
to do the following: 
  [Komsic] "They must give up the objectives of their 
aggression and must try to recreate the prewar situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which will be a very difficult and long 
process." 
  [Bucan] The agreement introduces a new dimension in the 
resolution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. The military 
option was not considered and we hope for a political resolution 
of the problem.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 23 Mar (TANJUG)--At the prearranged hour 
this morning, the corridor linking the Serb suburbs of Lukavica 
and Ilidza via Sarajevo airport was opened to traffic. 
  Under a recent agreement between the Serb and Muslim side, a 
corridor linking the Muslim-controlled suburbs of Butmir and 
Dobrinja will also open today. 
  First, buses with civilians on board set off from Ilidza for 
Lukavica and Pale this morning. A bus left for Belgrade. 
  For the first time since the airport was handed over to 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] control, people from Serb 
Sarajevo were able to use the Lukavica-Ilidza road. There have 
been no traffic problems so far. 
  The Serb fighters bridge (formerly Brotherhood and Unity 
bridge), which links Grbavica with the Muslim part of Sarajevo, 
has not yet been opened to civilians because the Muslim side is 
demanding that Serb authorities in the Novo Sarajevo 
municipality remove the Srpska republic's state symbols from the 
Serb side of the border crossing. 
  The bridge and the Sarajevo-Visoko corridor via Vogosca are, 
however, expected to open to traffic later today.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 22 (TANJUG)--The President of the 
Assembly of the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS) Momcilo Krajisnik 
said Tuesday that no one should take the responsibility of 
unilaterally opening the Tuzla airfield, but that he feared that 
anything was possible today. 
  Krajisnik said this in an interview to Radio Jagodina, 
commenting the announcement of Moslem Radio Sarajevo that 
Tuesday the airfield near Tuzla would be opened. Tuzla is a 
Moslem enclave in northeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  On Tuesday a U.N. plane landed on Tuzla airfield with the 
U.N. Special Envoy for the Former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi on 
board. This was interpreted as the reopening of the airfield for 
humanitarian flights. 
  The spokesman of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) Silvana Foa denied this stating that the Tuzla airfield 
would not be opened before Bosnian Serbs and Moslems agreed on 
the way the incoming cargo is to be controlled. 
  The Serb side has not reached a final agreement with the 
Moslems on the opening of the Tuzla airfield, there is only an 
agreement with the Russians on its opening under certain 
conditions, negotiations on the subject are not over yet, 
Krajisnik said. 
  Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic and the Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev reached an agreement early this 
month in Moscow on the opening of the Tuzla airfield for 
humanitarian needs. Fearing that the Moslems could use the 
airfield to bring in arms the Serbs asked for the incoming cargo 
to be checked by Russian peacekeepers and Serb observers. 
  The Tuzla military airfield was closed in May 1992, a month 
after the war between the local Serbs, Croats and Moslems in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina broke out. 
  Krajisnik said that on Wednesday the RS parliament would 
examine how Bosnia-Herzegovina would be constituted, the future 
relations with the Moslem-Croat federation and the platform of 
the Serb side in the next round of talks. 
  Bosnian Croats and Moslems have signed an agreement in the 
White House, under strong U.S. pressure, on the establishment of 
a Croat-Moslem federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and on general 
principles of its later confederation with the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Croatia. The question of whether the Bosnian Serbs 
will join the federation, insisted upon by Washington, has been 
left open. 
  Stressing that the deputies cannot overlook the question of 
the division of the territories between the Serb side and the 
Moslem-Croat federation Krajisnik said that the "Serbs own 64 
per cent of the territory and we shall insist on this actual 
ownership in all subsequent talks". 
  He added however, that they were ready to agree to certain 
concessions in the percentage of the territory if it meant that 
compact areas would be created. "This is nevertheless far below 
the 50 per cent of the territory spoken about by the U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher", the RS assembly 
president said.

  [Text] Geneva, March 22 (TANJUG) -- The airfield near 
Tuzla, a Moslem enclave in northeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, will 
not be opened until Serbs and Moslems agree on how the cargo 
will be checked, Sylvana Foa, spokeswoman for the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said on Tuesday. 
  Foa could not specify when the airfield would be put into 
operation, except for confirming that technically, the facility 
was ready to reopen. Everything is ready, only an agreement of 
the two sides is awaited, she said. 
  The fact that a U.N. plane with U.N. Special Envoy Yasushi 
Akashi landed at Tuzla airfield on Tuesday has been interpreted 
as the renewal of the humanitarian bridge. 
  The airfield near Tuzla was closed on May 1992, a month 
after 
the war in the former Yugoslav [words indistinct] Herzegovina 
had broken out between local Serbs, Croats and Moslems. 
  Tuzla is a Moslem enclave in the Serb-controlled territory. 
Bosnian Serbs, who fear that the airfield may be used for arms 
shipments to Moslems, insist that their monitors and Russian 
peacekeepers check all incoming cargo. Foa said last week's 
humanitarian effort was the most successful since the UNHCR 
started operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 9,400 metric tonnes 
of aid delivered last week almost constitute the optimum level 
of deliveries, she added. 
  In collaboration with UNICEF's organization for children in 
exile which is based in Zagreb, the UNHCR has launched an 
operation to bring together children and their parents. Foa 
said about 20,000 children aged up to 18 were seeking their 
parents. They have no identification papers and many of them 
are too little to know who their parents are and where they 
might be.

  [Text] Zvornik, March 21 (TANJUG)--A convoy of the U.N. 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), carrying 112 tonnes of 
flour, on Monday unhindered and safely crossed Bosnian Serb 
territory on its way for Moslem-held Tuzla, eastern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, TANJUG learned from Bosnian Serb military 
sources. 
  Owing to the efforts of the Bosnian Serbs, the relief aid 
ground routes towards Tuzla and other Moslem-, i.e. Croat-held 
towns in Bosnia, have so far remained safe and open. 
  Bosnian Serb military sources once again rejected claims by 
the international community that the opening of the Tuzla 
airport is "necessary" out of humanitarian reasons, and 
expressed doubt that other reasons and intentions lie behind the 
action. 
  The Bosnian Serbs, fearing that the Moslems could use the 
airport to illegally acquire arms under the guise of 
humanitarian aid, have made its opening conditional that the 
airport is monitored by Russian peacekeepers and that Serb 
observers control the cargo checks.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Omer Ibrahimovic] </F>
  [Text] At its 20 March session, the Serbian Consultative 
Council decided to propose to the Croatian Coordination 
Committee and the Council of the Congress of the Bosnian Muslim 
Intellectuals to hold a joint convention of reconciliation 
between the Bosniaks, the Serbs, and the Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Here is a commentary by Omer Ibrahimovic: 
  [Ibrahimovic] I do not doubt the good intentions of those 
proposing this convention. However, it is obvious that this 
proposal was not a result of more elaborate thinking. I suspect 
that it was someone's hasty idea that was instantly turned into 
a conclusion of this important body. The initial reaction to 
this proposal must be a question: Why should these three people 
seek reconciliation when they have not been involved in a 
conflict against one another? 
  Even the birds know the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is not the 
consequence of a dispute between three peoples living there, as 
the aggressor has been trying to present to the world all this 
time. This is a classical aggression by three neighboring states 
-- Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia -- over territorial 
integrity, independence, and state sovereignty of the Republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was also confirmed by the 
international community. 
  The fact that the aggression was joined by the collaborators 
and members of the fifth column from the ranks of its own 
citizens, members of all three peoples, which were led by 
Karadzic, Boban, and Abdic, does not mean that the peoples were 
in the conflict themselves and that they should now seek 
reconciliation. With their thesis on the conflict among the 
peoples, the authors of the convention for reconciliation, even 
though they did not intend it, are, objectively speaking, 
marginalizing the aggression and minimizing the responsibility 
for aggression. 
  If anyone should seek reconciliation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
then it would make more sense that the Bosnian Serbs, who 
remained on the free territory and suffered the burden of the 
war together with the other two peoples, establish the 
conditions at their upcoming convention under which they would 
reconcile with their compatriots who, by joining the aggressor, 
fired at them and their children, held them under a siege 
without elementary conditions for living, tortured them with all 
kinds of blockades, and kept them under the psychological 
pressure of their propaganda machinery. 
  The same applies to the Bosnian Croats and their extremists, 
who worked against the interests of their people and their 
country, like the Bosnian Serb extremists did by taking part in 
the realization of the policy of territorial partition of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, trading with its territory, and the 
so-called human exchanges of their people, committing at the 
same time the crime of genocide against the other two nations 
through the so-called ethnic cleansing of their national 
territories. 
  Even after two years of human suffering, all types of 
fascism 
that emerged in this region are referred to in general terms, as 
if the term fascism could not be bear the name of the people who 
promoted it. 
  Therefore, the primary question today is not the 
reconciliation of these three peoples. They continued to live 
on the free territories, as was the case in the past. The 
primary question is under what conditions will the Bosnian Serbs 
and the Bosnian Croats reconcile with their compatriots who were 
killing their children and destroying their houses and property. 
  The Bosnian Muslims have already taken their stand by 
directly confronting the supporters of [Fikret] Abdic, since all 
appeals to reason were understood as the weakness of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, instead of calling for a 
convention of reconciliation among the three peoples, it would 
be more sensible to ask one's own people on the occupied 
territories, as patriots of their homeland of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, to turn their rifles against the fascist 
leaders and their followers, who have committed so many crimes 
against their own people. 
  Everyone must understand that, regardless of whether this 
convention of reconciliation was held, there will be no peace in 
Bosnian until the last refugee returns to his home, even if this 
home was burned down, and until the last criminal, regardless of 
his nationality, is punished for his crimes. 
  I would, therefore, recommend to those who proposed the 
convention and setting up of various commissions for building 
confidence among different peoples to keep clear of bad 
business, but to direct their political energy and influence in 
the people on the mobilization of people to stand against 
fascism and its executors in their own ranks. 
  Clinton himself recently said that Serbian fascism is the 
most responsible for the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, although one 
should not exonerate the Muslim and Croat fascists either. Our 
people do not need new illusions and political fog in the form 
of reconciliation conventions but an active struggle against 
fascism in one's own ranks.

  [Text] Reporter Zdenko Vranjes reports on the talks on the 
status of Mostar and on the Croat-Muslim exchange of prisoners: 
  [Vranjes] In talks with Herceg-Bosna Prime Minister Jadranko 
Prlic, Minister Mile Akmadzic, and Mayor of Mostar Stojan Vrlic, 
members of the EU [European Union] delegation stressed they were 
satisfied with the evident readiness on both sides to approach 
the Washington agreement -- regarding Mostar -- sincerely and 
cooperatively. This will facilitate the task of the EU, which 
wishes, in an impartial way, to accelerate the normalization of 
life in Mostar, said Greek Ambassador Dimitros Rales, who leads 
the three-member EU delegation in its mission to investigate the 
situation on the ground before the EU begins the first steps to 
establish its administration. 
  The members of the EU delegation toured the east part of 
Mostar and held talks with the Muslim authorities. Croat 
representatives at the talks raised the issue of significant 
changes in the national composition of the population of Mostar, 
caused by the arrival from eastern Herzegovina of Muslim 
refugees and displaced persons, which, in the opinion of the 
Croat side, had been the cause of the months-long conflict. We 
guess that it will be important to agree who will return and who 
will stay and live in Mostar. 
  The second round of the prisoner exchange, agreed on in 
Uskopje between the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and the 
Bosnian Muslim side, took place today. The 251 prisoners 
released by the Croats from Rodoc, near Mostar, arrived in the 
eastern part of Mostar in zUNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] 
vehicles this afternoon. The Muslim side released six HVO 
members from Gornji Vakuf. Another 32 Croat prisoners released 
from Vares are expected to arrive in Kiseljak this afternoon, as 
well as 315 Croat civilians who took refuge at the UNPROFOR base 
in Carici near Kakanj during the Muslim offensive last year.

<F P=106> [Report by Zvonko Maric] </F>
  [Text] The past 20 days on the free territory of the 
Hadzici commune have passed in the spirit of the cease-fire, 
albeit burdened by numerous gatherings of the families of 189 
missing persons, Bosniak Muslims from Hadzici. This prompted 
the commune authorities and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army to 
intensify negotiations on the exchange of prisoners. Late last 
night a meeting took place between our negotiating team -- Edo 
Godinjak, a representative of the republican Interior Ministry, 
Nedir Hadzic, the commander of the 9th Hill Brigade, and 
Brigadier Ajnadzic, who heads the team -- and representatives of 
the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] headed by Commander Santana. 
  At the very beginning of the meeting, Brigadier Ajnadzic 
made 
a goodwill gesture by offering several concessions to the 
aggressor side in order finally to deblock the process of 
exchanging prisoners from Silos for the 189 missing Hadzici 
citizens, which has generally been the toughest issue in the 
negotiations between [Prime Minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Haris] Silajdzic and [Bosnian Serb official Momcilo] Krajisnik. 
It was agreed that today three prisoners from Silos prison 
would be exchanged for three prisoners from Kula. Four captured 
aggressor soldiers, which the prisoners in Silos elected 
themselves, were permitted to attend last night's meeting. 
Brigadier Ajnadzic proposed that a meeting be arranged on the 
free territory of the Hadzici commune between the 
representatives of four families of the captured aggressor 
soldiers with the families of the missing Hadzici citizens. 
Moreover, all the Serbian representatives will be allowed to 
visit the prisoners in Silos. It was also decided that from 
today [23 March], the prisoners from Silos would be allowed to 
establish telephone contact with [words indistinct] with 
families in Hadzici. 
  Mr. Santana expressed his gratitude for our delegation's 
concessions, and did not hide his dissatisfaction with the 
uncooperative attitude of the aggressor side, saying that he had 
the impression that it was not interested in the exchange, 
something that cannot be said for the family members of the 
Silos prisoners. Edo Godinjak, representative of the republican 
Interior Ministry, promised the UNPROFOR representatives that, 
in the course of the day, he would submit to them substantial 
documented video material that the republican Interior Ministry 
had obtained, which documents the ways, places, and those 
responsible for capturing the 189 Bosniak Muslim citizens of 
Hadzici. This material will help Captain Mason, who heads 
UNPROFOR's investigative team, locate the missing persons. 
According to Mr. Godinjak, Ratko Radic, Zoran Gasevic, Rade 
Veselinovic, Kiro Glagas, and Mladen Tolj participated in the 
capture of the missing persons. Commander of the 9th Hill 
Brigade Nedir Hadzic expressed his readiness to go ahead with an 
immediate exchange, but he stressed that the local authorities 
would not agree to any of the types of blackmail that the 
aggressor side has been using in prisoner exchange negotiations 
since the beginning of the war. The agreement will be 
implemented today, provided that the aggressor side decides to 
cooperate, of course.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zeman, director of the </F>
Communications Section at the Ministry of Transport, 
Communications, and Public Works, by Stefan Mesaros; place and 
date not given: "Moments of Weakness and Influential Waves; 
Wherein Lies the Problem of Radio Free Europe Broadcasts?"] 
  [Text] According to Engineer Vladimir Ondrovic, director 
[general] of Slovak Telecommunications [ST], the one-day break 
in Radio Free Europe [RFE] broadcasts in Slovakia on Wednesday 
[16 March] was caused by the staff of the Ministry of Transport, 
Communications, and Public Works. The "villain" who issued the 
order supposedly was Engineer Vladimir Zeman, director of the 
Communications Section at the Ministry of Transport, 
Communications, and Public Works. How did he pull this off? 
This is discussed by Eng. Zeman himself, who gave us an 
interview. 
  [Mesaros] Are you really the person responsible for Eng. 
Ondrovic's "moment of weakness," in which he signed the decree 
on the abolition of RFE broadcasts in Slovakia? 
  [Zeman] I do not know who has moments of weakness or when, 
but my opinion is that managers simply should not have them when 
they sign important documents. I also consider unfair Eng. 
Ondrovic's statement that I forced him to sign the document and, 
subsequently, a copy of it. I think that he signed the document 
quite voluntarily, of his own volition. As for the copy, why 
would I need the same document again? 
  [Mesaros] Nevertheless, it seems strange that RFE broadcasts 
were cut off at the time a new government was taking shape. Was 
this not an act of defiance by the ministry's outgoing top 
leadership? 
  [Zeman] Those who know the problems surrounding RFE 
broadcasts know they have been dragging on for quite some time. 
When someone tries to make the public believe that this issue 
has only a political background, he is not telling the truth. 
Some people may have the impression that politics, too, are 
involved. Personally, I am interested only in the technical and 
economic aspects of the matter. Apart from that, I ask myself 
why, if these are supposed to be broadcasts for Slovakia, almost 
80 percent of them are in Czech. Are we a sovereign state or 
not? After all, the broadcasts for Poles are not in Russian but 
in Polish! I stress, however, that these circumstances did not 
determine the step that was taken. 
  [Mesaros] At the aforementioned news conference, Eng. 
Ondrovic claimed that the RFE license, which entitles it to 
broadcast in Slovakia, is in perfect order. If that is the 
case, why were the broadcasts interrupted? 
  [Zeman] Apparently, he is not adequately informed. Had he 
been adequately informed, he would have known that the 
broadcasting license for RFE was issued by the former Federal 
Council for Television and Radio Broadcasting. Besides the fact 
that we have never renewed it, the issued license has a number 
of formal shortcomings that make it virtually invalid. Far more 
problems exist in the technical and economic spheres. In 
January 1994, we proposed a solution to these problems with the 
draft of a new contract. Had the RFE management approached this 
matter more flexibly, the new contract, which is advantageous 
for them as well as for us, could have been signed a long time 
ago. Whereas at present they pay us $680,000 annually for the 
transmission of the signal, under the new contract they would 
pay $1.5 million, but for a signal of much better quality that 
would cover a wider area. At the talks, they were also asked to 
broadcast for ethnic minorities in the Slovak Republic, as well. 
  [Mesaros] Do your words imply that the new management of the 
ministry, too, should reassess the terms under which RFE 
broadcasts? 
  [Zeman] I subscribe to that view. 
  [Mesaros] As we have learned, Eng. Ondrovic, whom you 
supposedly recalled [from the post of ST director general], has 
been reinstated by the new minister. Are you still in your post? 
  [Zeman] First of all, I would like to say that I did not 
have the authority to appoint or recall anyone to or from his 
post. However, the fact that the new minister had to reappoint 
Eng. Ondrovic bears out the fact that he had been recalled in a 
legally valid way. Hence, when posing at his news conference on 
Wednesday as ST director general, he was not right. As for me, 
for the time being I am still in my previous post. In an 
interview yesterday, the new minister said that he would be 
assessing people according to their work performance. I had a 
good impression from his words.

from the speech delivered by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar at 
the 11 March meeting of the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic prior to the passage of the vote of no-confidence in 
his government. The excerpts are published under the headline 
"A Society That Destabilizes Its Structures Is Defeated in

<F P=106> [Article by "(ptp)": "Confusion About the Reinforcements for </F>
Bosnia"] 
  [Text] New York/Prague--According to a senior UN official, 
the Czech Republic has promised to provide a United Nations 
Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] contingent of 500 men for Bosnia. 
However, in accordance with the government's decision, the Czech 
reinforcements should comprise only 120 troops. Domestic 
sources are denying the promise of greater reinforcements for 
Bosnia. 
  UN Deputy Secretary General Kofi Annan said, according to 
CTK, that 500 Czech troops should form part of the firmly 
promised reinforcements for Bosnia, which will number some 4,500 
men. He said this following a meeting with representatives from 
the states that have troops in UNPROFOR forces. 
  "This information is inaccurate," said Miroslav Tuma, a 
member of the Czech Republic's permanent mission to the United 
Nations in New York, who took part in the talks with Annan. "We 
talked about supplementing our battalion in the sector south of 
Croatian Krajina and not in Bosnia," he said. 
  Karel Kovanda, ambassador to the United Nations, said that 
the Czech Republic is indeed dispatching only 120 troops--that 
is, a company--to Bosnia. 
  Pavel Kracmar, the head of the liaison officers attached to 
the UNPROFOR headquarters in Zagreb, confirmed, nevertheless, 
that a report about 500 Czech reinforcements had been broadcast 
last week on CNN. However, Kracmar also thinks this is a 
mistake. "The Czech Republic has neither the potential nor the 
resources to do such a thing," he said. 
  According to reports from the Defense Ministry in Prague, no 
such reinforcement of the Czech UNPROFOR units is Bosnia is 
being taken into consideration. Such a high number could only 
be anticipated in a future objective by the UN command. 
  The government and parliament would have to make a decision 
on the possible deployment of another 500 troops in the former 
Yugoslavia.

Article Type:BFN 

<F P=106> [Commentary by Lubor Kohout: "From Baudys's Realm of </F>
Fantasy"] 
  [Text] Fairy tales are meant for children; of course, some 
adults like them too--especially the old, traditional ones. The 
appeal of modern fairy tales is not so strong. Defense Minister 
Antonin Baudys, with the support of his subordinates, told us 
one like this last Friday [18 March]. The minister deemed it 
necessary to respond to the articles published in CESKY DENIK. 
They claimed that strains of bacteria and viruses intended for 
use as the basis for biological weapons are being stored (or 
concealed) in our military facilities. 
  If we summarize the statements made by the ministerial and 
Army top brass, this is what we get: Bacteriological and 
virological weapons were never developed in our secret military 
facilities, and not at all for the purposes of the Warsaw Pact. 
The institute in Techonin never took part in such activity; the 
scientists in its laboratories worked only on immunological 
research. According to Ales Macela, the current vice president 
of the Military Medical Academy and a leading research worker at 
the Techonin institute, there were no technical conditions in 
his institute for achieving genetic changes in individual 
strains. The two batches of strains of bacteria and 
viruses--the one in Techonin and the one that was kept in the 
building leased to the Klinlab (Clinical Laboratories) limited 
company in the Central Military Hospital in Stresovice--were 
simply harmless batches prepared in case the state was involved 
in a defense emergency. Moreover, 80 percent of them were 
common viruses, and a mere 20 percent were exotic viruses. 
Summa summarum: By storing the aforementioned strains, the Army 
in no way violated the international convention on prohibiting 
the use, development, and accumulation of biological weapons. 
The interdepartmental commission, whose establishment was 
initiated by Baudys, decided that it was no longer necessary to 
keep the strains, and, therefore, the viral banks were 
destroyed. Absolutely nothing happened. Irresponsible 
journalists from CESKY DENIK just want to injure our Army. 
  In considering whether it is CESKY DENIK or the gentlemen 
from the Defense Ministry and the Army who are telling fairy 
tales, it is enough to recall some of the facts confirmed by 
Minister Baudys himself and Chief of the General Staff Nekvasil: 
On 13 February, in connection with the personnel changes in the 
military health service department, Baudys finds out for the 
first time about the existence of batches of strains. An 
investigation follows, and, on 17 February, an interdepartmental 
commission is set up on Baudys's initiative. The swift 
destruction of the first batch in Stresovice begins in the next 
seven days. The defense minister personally orders the 
destruction. The chief of the General Staff also gives his 
personal guarantee that the destruction was carried out safely 
and that there was no risk. On 9 March, the ministerial and 
Army top brass receive the news that there is another batch of 
strains in Techonin in East Bohemia. Another swift destruction 
follows. 
  Other facts, not mentioned by Baudys, speak plainly. The 
whole affair has been investigated since the beginning by 
officers from Military Defense Intelligence (VOZ), who were 
present at the destruction along with the Military Police. VOZ 
is also taking care of the Techonin research documentation; of 
course, on Friday, Ales Macela claimed that it is still stored 
in Techonin. The Defense Ministry is handing over part of the 
case to the Security and Information Service. What on earth 
for? After all, only allegedly "common and no longer necessary" 
strains were destroyed! 
  There were several ways Minister Baudys could have acted 
before Friday. One of these was telling the truth. He could 
have said that genetically altered viruses and bacteria 
developed for use as biological weapons had been concealed 
without his knowledge. He could have admitted that they are 
still--in all probability--"stored" in other, so far unknown, 
places. He chose another course of action and thus associated 
himself with the people who had developed and concealed these 
materials. Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman 
Jiri Payne declared yesterday that the whole incident has to be 
thoroughly investigated. It only remains for me to add that, if 
CESKY DENIK has not reported the truth, the authors of the 
articles are, according to the law, criminally liable. They 
could, for example, have committed the crime of spreading 
alarming reports. If the defense minister is familiar with the 
criminal law, he knows that he is required to submit a 
complaint. He will probably not do so, however, and he knows 
why. The ministerial fairy tales would not be enough to obtain a 
conviction in a law-governed state.

<F P=106> [Article by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus: "English </F>
Conservatism Is Close To Us"] 
  [Text] Springtime is already well advanced in London at the 
beginning of March. The grass is really green; not only 
narcissi but also pansies are flowering, and the first fruit 
trees are blossoming. Prague seems to be several weeks behind 
in this regard. 
  England is--by the way, as always--the real England. The 
taxis are the same as they were before World War I, and the 
policemen, too. Respectable gentlemen ride horses early in the 
morning in Hyde Park near your hotel. You go through precisely 
the same formalities with John Major in front of No. 10 Downing 
Street as previously. At dinner in a club with Conservative 
Party Chairman Norman Fowler, a fire is glowing in a real 
fireplace (just as in the Rothschild banking house). Quite 
simply, everything is the way it should be. Only Attali's bank 
exceeds your expectations because it is even more ostentatious 
(although in very refined taste) than you had imagined. 
  You again realize that England is and is not Europe. It is 
the only important European country that is an island. 
  It is proud of the fact that, in the period from 1066 to 
1945, it never succumbed to an external onslaught, and it has 
never lost a war on its own territory. It proceeds from the 
premise that, in the 18th and 19th centuries, it spread 
throughout the world the ideas of Locke, Hume, and Adam Smith on 
individualism, private ownership, a law-governed state, and the 
market economy, and that these ideas were--and still 
are--formulated in English, and that, by their intensity, 
profundity, and ethos, they have left a fundamental mark on 
today's world. It does not want to abandon these ideas and its 
indisputable independence, and it is from this angle of vision 
that it looks at present-day Europe and its unification within 
the framework of the European Community (or Union). 
  It would be an exaggeration to say that destructive 
Euroskepticism prevails in England; the British are, on the 
contrary, constructive Eurorealists, and I have the feeling that 
we are in the same boat. They believe in European integration; 
they do not believe so much in European institutions. They do 
not want a federalist superstate, but this stance is based on 
something else, something far more profound than rigid and 
shortighted nationalism. They are, in essence, a unitary state 
and are watching closely, from this very angle of vision, 
developments in other European states with regard to today's 
integrative mechanisms. They are afraid that the Maastricht 
model will have, paradoxically for its supporters, very strong 
disintegrative consequences. Apart from the danger of Brussels' 
bureaucratic centralism, which they are really worried about, 
they see no less a danger in the gradual disintegration of 
certain existing European states (they see and hear Catalonia, 
Lombardy, and their own Scotland; they monitor the Flemings and 
the Walloons in Belgium, and Bavaria, also) with only one 
possible outcome--disturbing the status quo and the dawn of a 
clouded European future. Instead of the European Twelve, 
several dozen small states may evolve, proceeding more from the 
concept of the 16th than the 20th century. 
  All of this is important for us, from both the point of view 
of our incorporation into Europe and that of our domestic 
territorial arrangement. When I discussed this with Mrs. 
Margaret Thatcher (this was a couple of hours after the 
Hungarian foreign minister had proposed in Trieste the cantonal 
model as a suitable method for the future Central European 
arrangement), she said "you cannot cantonize the world" and 
added that it is vital to clarify what the "natural unit of 
self-determination" is. For her (and for me, too), the nation 
state is such a unit--that is, not a smaller unit but a larger 
one. In this sense, the reasoning in the discussion on internal 
and external integration is in fact concordant. Supporters of 
regions are supporters of a unionist (if you like, federalist) 
Europe, while the critics of the excessive regionalization of 
the small Czech state are, at the same time, critics of the 
excessive federalization of Europe. 
  English conservatism is, in many ways, close to us, and I 
think that this feeling is mutual. The successes of the Czech 
Republic during the past four years are really appreciated very 
positively there, and the level of mutual understanding is 
unusually great. 
  When I deliver speeches to the public there (this time in 
the 
Royal Institute of International Affairs and the Adam Smith 
Institute, of which I ceremonially became a member), I have to 
"sell" our successes, I have to strive for good publicity for 
our country. At home, we are often, for incomprehensible 
reasons, criticized for this by our ill-wishers, but I am 
convinced that, in essence, we are doing so correctly. 
  So as not to make an evaluation myself, I will end this 
recollection of England with a quote from the influential daily 
THE GUARDIAN (of 26 February 1994): "Let us imagine that the 
Czech prime minister takes over the presidency of the European 
Union and that, at the same time, he becomes involved in a 
conflict with French farmers, whom he accuses of being spoiled 
by the state. 
  "The koruna, fully convertible, is attracting extraordinary 
attention on world stock markets, and the British press, 
pointing to the further loss of British prestige, is complaining 
that the Czechs are catching up with us. 
  "Is this a futuristic fantasy? Or is it Europe at the end of 
this century? 
  "Unless something extremely unpleasant happens in the world, 
the Czechs have every right to expect that this scenario is very 
close to reality." 
  We should certainly accept with pleasure this vision of a 
British journalist, and I believe that each of us is doing, and 
will do, his utmost to ensure that it is fulfilled as soon as 
possible.

  [Text] According to journalists' estimates, following the 
call by the Czech-Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions Association, 
approximately 40,000 people gathered in the Old Town Square in 
Prague at midday today to tell the government and deputies that 
the situation of employees and pensioners is nearing the limits 
of tolerance. Chamber Chairman Vladimir Petrus addressed the 
rally. 
  [Begin Petrus recording] What should also be asked is: What 
is the reason for this state of affairs? The laws are 
imperfect, the linkage between the laws is poor, there is a 
perceptible lack of jurisdiction governing administrative and 
labor affairs. Other necessary laws that could prevent these 
phenomena and developments from taking place are clearly absent, 
too. 
  These are the problems that you, the government and the 
parliament, should focus on; this is the area where your efforts 
should be targeted. But do not look for enemies and extremists 
in the trade unions. [applause] 
  All of the extremes, foreign and domestic ones 
alike--Zhirinovskiy and his supporters, no matter where they may 
be--are alien to us. For this very reason, we consider it our 
civic duty to speak up and say that we have had enough, that 
things cannot go on like this, that people's dissatisfaction is 
looming over us, and that it is inadvisable to play around with 
this dissatisfaction. [applause] [end recording]

  [Text] A little while ago, Czech radio asked Czech Prime 
Minister Vaclav Klaus to comment on today's rally staged by the 
Czech-Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions Association. 
  [Begin Klaus recording] I am not at all willing to comment 
on 
this rally because the government has not contributed one iota 
to this rally. This is simply a 100-percent, or 101-percent, 
matter of the trade unions. This has nothing to do whatsoever 
with the government. 
  The talks between the government and the trade unions have 
been conducted in an absolutely correct way, I think. A number 
of comments trade unions had regarding the amendment of the 
Labor Code have been accepted. Thus, any consideration that the 
government failed to consult these matters with the trade unions 
is an absolute lie and a fallacy. It does not necessarily 
follow that the government should accept all of the trade 
unions' comments in their entirety, as some trade union leaders 
might wish. In my view, there is nothing in this matter that 
the government would have to feel responsible for. I am getting 
reports from all over the Republic speaking about false pressure 
campaigns when trade unionists invite people to take a free trip 
to Prague, where, as part of this trip, they would briefly 
attend some kind of rally. Telephone calls, faxes, and letters 
coming from people all over the Republic clearly reveal these 
actions on the part of the trade unions. Personally, I would be 
ashamed to be a trade union leader. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] According to Gabor Kuncze, the Alliance of Free 
Democrats' [SZDSZ] nominee for the post of prime minister, the 
government is pursuing propaganda that highlights its successes 
in the run-up to the elections. Therefore, Kuncze criticized 
the government. He said that to provide a complete picture one 
also had to talk about negative phenomena. Zsuzsa Ladanyi 
reports on the forum for the inhabitants of Kalocsa [central 
Hungary]. 
  [Ladanyi] People are filled with fears and this is 
frightening for me. [passage omitted] Kuncze added that many 
people did not hand over their recommendation slips [for 
candidates in the 8 May elections] because they were afraid that 
their data could be registered somewhere and be misused. I 
think this fear is unfounded and the institutions of democracy 
are stable in Hungary, Kuncze said. [passage omitted] 
  We heard at the forum in Kalocsa that Kuncze had found that 
people were paying attention more and more to what the various 
parties were saying. Thus, it is important for them to be aware 
of the election possibilities. Therefore, it is particularly 
sad that discussion programs, which have counterbalanced 
government propaganda and in which opinions have been set out 
against one another, have been taken off the television. What 
happened at state radio [dismissals] will also lead to this. 
The next government should guarantee the impartiality of 
television and radio and supervise impartiality, Kuncze said. 
  He said that a high turnout at the elections was extremely 
important so that the coalition had sufficient backing and that 
extremes do not get into parliament, said the SZDSZ's nominee 
for prime minister at the forum for inhabitants of Kalocsa.

<F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "The Anti-Inflationary Policy of </F>
the Republic Party -- A Social-Economic Fund Is Sufficient"] 
  [Text] The consolidation of banks, begun by the current 
government, would be followed by an acceptable pace of 
privatization mainly from 1995. Accordingly, the Republic Party 
urges the influx of foreign capital, instead of a redistribution 
of stocks. The Republic Party recently described its monetary 
and fiscal policy and its effect on inflation. According to 
Republic Party Deputy Chairman Laszlo Fodor, it is still 
possible to cope with a budget deficit of 5 percent of the GDP. 
It is essential that Hungary fulfills its debt-repayment 
obligations. If a new government takes power after the 
elections, the Republic Party will play a role in this 
government and will assert its view that Hungary still needs a 
basically strict monetary and fiscal policy for quite a while. 
  The Republic Party urges the development of a banking 
environment more interested in financing the economic players 
than in investing in state bonds. The program of the Republic 
Party includes an interest policy and system that lead to 
interest rates encouraging savings. Laszlo Fodor mentioned the 
fact that the party thinks that the program of the current 
government in financing the exports and imports is worth 
continuing, and it is necessary to set up a relevant bank for 
this, as well as a stock company to provide export guarantees. 
It is already certain that, if they get into the government, 
the Republic Party will submit a supplementary budget by the 
second half of this year. They will immediately eliminate the 
system of separated state funds; instead, they will set up a 
single such institution. This social-economic fund would 
replace the current 100 or more funds and it would finance 
projects on the basis of a uniform, strict and throughly 
controlled system of criteria. According to Laszlo Fodor, 
everything that is happening with these funds in Parliament 
today is only helping a wasteful economy, because the current 
law allows these funds to give loans to each other in exchange 
for interest. 
  The Republic Party thinks that income from privatization can 
be the source of reducing the state debts and, therefore, the 
party wants to allocate more funds for this, and would 
recirculate the remaining funds into the economy. The economic 
program of the Republic Party finds its unrealistic to achieve a 
one-digit inflation in a short time, but it is certain that 
inflation can be maintained much below 20 percent. The party 
does not intend to bring elements that increase the inflationary 
pressure in the economy. In case it gets into power, the 
Republic Party will guarantee the indexation of pensions, 
minimum wages, and public employees' salaries every three 
months, in order to adjust them to the rate of inflation. Thus, 
the party could achieve an increase in purchasing power. The 
party wants to achieve a similar agreement between the employees 
and the employers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Fazekas, secretary of the Hungarian </F>
Socialist Workers' Party, by Daniel Bodnar; place and date not 
given: "Convinced Communists"] 
  [Excerpts] The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party 
[MSZMP] led by Gyula Thurmer changed its name to Labor Party in 
March 1993. However, a small group of MSZMP members thought that 
Thurmer's Labor Party wanted to become a bourgeois workers 
party, and this was unacceptable for them. Therefore, they did 
not join the new party and continued to engage in politics by 
maintaining the party's old name. A 43-years-old entrepreneur, 
Laszlo Fazekas, became the secretary of the MSZMP, a party with 
a small number of members. He has been an MSZMP member since 
1975. He proudly claims that he joined the MSZMP out of 
conviction, and not by force, at the time. [passage omitted] 
  [Bodnar] How would you characterize the MSZMP? 
  [Fazekas] We are a party based on Marxist-Leninist ideas and 
our collective decisionmaking mechanism is based on 
collectivism. The present MSZMP can be defined as a democratic 
party, building from below. With our efforts and our current 
modest means, we would like to serve the future. 
  [Bodnar] How do you relate to the bourgeois democracy? 
  [Fazekas] We accept its existence, but it is our firm goal 
to create a real democracy; our main goal is to create a real 
people's power. Of course, we want to achieve our goals within 
a constitutional framework, by means of elections. We attribute 
a considerable role to the activity of political information; by 
this, we would like to make sure that the masses finally 
understand our real interests. We accept the multiparty system 
and we believe that no party can function properly without a 
really critical opposition. A multiparty system can be useful, 
but it must be filled with real content. 
  [Bodnar] What kind of relations do you have with the various 
leftist organizations? I mean here primarily the Labor Party, 
the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], and the National 
Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions [MSZOSZ]. 
  [Fazekas] Since March 1993, we have been doing our utmost on 
our part to work out a cooperation and action program based on 
the principle of equality. Unfortunately, our former 
mother-party, the present Labor Party, does not show proper 
flexibility toward our approach. Our approach to other leftist 
organization is not really rapid either because of the 
tremendous stakes of the parliamentary elections. Although we 
have ideas regarding the future on paper, everything is too much 
tied down in the current situation for a leftist cooperation to 
emerge on an increasingly large platform. However, we are 
convinced, and we also informed our future partners about this, 
that only a real collaboration of the leftist forces can lead to 
a real change in the political life. [passage omitted] 
  I think that the left can be definitely more successful in 
four years time, because the domestic social processes and the 
European and global economic processes will drift the people 
toward the left, whether some political circles like it or not. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Bodnar] What results do you count on in the elections? 
  [Fazekas] It would be a real achievement for us if we could 
express our opinion about the current state of affairs and about 
the future in as many places as possible, because the current 
practice of turning to the past, something that characterizes 
certain political circles, is absolutely inexpedient and it 
draws the attention away from the really important problems. I 
think it will definitely be a political gain for us if we can 
voice our opinions in more than half of the election districts. 
We will not despair even if the party remains without any 
parliamentary deputy, because time is working for us anyway.

  [Excerpts] Since the establishment of Slovakia's new 
government, this is the first visit by a Slovak minister abroad 
to Budapest. Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis has confirmed 
that military cooperation continues under the agreement signed 
by Hungarian Defense Minister Lajos Fur with the Slovak defense 
minister last October 1993. Laszlo Gardai reports on the 
details. 
  [Begin recording] [Gardai] [passage omitted] I asked the 
Slovak defense minister what are the chances of a political turn 
in the relations of the two countries in his view, and what kind 
of steps would be necessary to be taken by the two sides. 
  [Kanis in Slovak with superimposed Hungarian translation] A 
more civilized political conduct is required than the one we had 
so far. It applies to both Slovak and foreign politicians. It 
would be important that the small countries established on the 
territories of former federations give up nationalism. 
Nationalism implies isolation in this region. Slovakia will be 
open in the future, and we will devote special attention to the 
cooperation between the member states of the Visegrad Four, the 
Slovak defense minister said. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Democratic Alliance Chairman Neritan Ceka by </F>
Ernest Tushe; place and date not given: "Neritan Ceka Speaks 
Out"] 
  [Text] [Tushe] The last week has been fraught with a 
number of disturbing incidents in our country's politics. How 
would you assess the political situation on the basis of these 
events? 
  [Ceka] I consider the political situation to have been 
inflamed artificially. For you journalists, Albania is really 
an ideal country where you do not have to chase news, because 
the state drops in into your lap in the most incredible fashion. 
However, these incidents give rise to despair in Albanian 
readers wearied of both the past and their present lives, that 
might be summed up in the words: "This lot are the same as the 
old ones!" 
  I think that two factors have inflamed the situation. First, 
there is the factor of economic insecurity. Despite the 
euphoric figure of a 10 percent growth in production, the state 
exchequer is in the red and will remain so in 1994. This 
feeling of hunger is making the state nervous. 
  The second factor concerns the primitive level of political 
culture on which this state rests. In essence, it has much in 
common with communist collectivism, but differs from it in being 
based not on ideology but on nepotism, regional ties, and other 
primitive criteria. In both cases, the political result is 
hatred for free men and, in the constitutional sense, free 
citizens. As a result, those who wield power today, who found 
themselves at the head of the democratic movement accidentally, 
are always one step behind the prevailing mentality and are now 
in conflict with it. 
  [Tushe] Specifically, you also accuse the state of the 
assault on deputy Teodor Keko. Is it possible that his former 
friends could do such things? 
  [Ceka] I would not be surprised in the slightest if I were 
told that the criminal was sent by the ShIK [National 
Intelligence Service], ShIU [Military Intelligence Service] or 
ShIR [expansion unknown]. Representatives of these services 
were involved in the murder of Gjovalin Cekini in Shkoder and 
have not suffered any consequences. The fact that one week 
after the assault on Keko the president of the republic, the 
prime minister, the public order minister, and Mr. Arbnori have 
not said a single word in public, and have not sent a single 
official to learn about the incident or to enquire about deputy 
T. Keko's health, shows that his former friends are now on the 
side of the aggressor. I do not want to exaggerate by saying 
that the criminal was physically sent directly by them. 
However, morally, the brass knuckles in Keko's face were 
inspired by the aggressive speeches of those in power, the 
mistreatment of the opposition in parliament and politics, and 
the misinformation of radio and television. 
  As a human being, T. Keko stands much higher than those who 
were morally or physically behind his attacker. He is a 
first-rate writer and the sort of person who naturally finds it 
hard to make enemies. You have to nurse a powerful, primitive, 
and schizophrenic hatred of somebody to send against Keko, at a 
time when he has written such fine poems and stories, an 
unwashed, unshaven, long- haired individual to hit him with 
brass knuckles. These "sons of cunning fathers," as Lermontov 
once called those who order the murders of poets, should at 
least teach their hitmen how to wash, shave, and cut their hair 
and not to attack little Keko and his wife in such a hit-and-run 
fashion. 
  As far as the state is concerned, after the murderers of 
Shkoder, who fired with the president's name in their mouths, 
the state also has the hitman of Tirana on its side. This is a 
very serious matter, just like the Mateotti crime in Italy, and 
the state is obliged to speak out. Either it must publicly 
condemn the two crimes, or the president and the prime minister 
should admit that they are not in control of the situation. 
Otherwise, by their silence, they remain on the side of the 
crime. 
  I feel obliged here to point out the responsibility of the 
parliament and in particular that of the majority, on whose 
ballots political crime in Albania relies for its security. I 
cannot understand how a parliament can manage to remain silent 
when a criminal strikes one of its members in the middle of the 
street. A parliament that continually raises its voice over 
violations of Albanian rights in Kosova cannot discount as an 
Albanian the deputy Moikom Zeqo, who was maltreated in 
Montenegro, merely because he belongs to the Socialist Party 
[PS]. Before we are members of the Democratic Party, the PS, 
the Democratic Alliance [AD], or the Social Democratic Party, we 
are Albanian citizens and the parliament and the state have the 
same responsibilities to us all. But this is a parliament where 
the majority of deputies are struggling for their salaries and 
for two rooms and a kitchen in Tirana. In fact, all Albanian 
politics today is calculated on the basis of people wanting a 
job and an apartment in Tirana, or wanting to hide something in 
their past or present lives. 
  [Tushe] The public, before learning of any determination on 
the part of the state to arrest Gjovalin Cekini's murderers, was 
shocked by the suicide of his brother, Mehill Cekini. 
  [Ceka] Mehill Cekini did not kill himself. He was murdered 
by the state's silence. We are dealing with the tragedy of a 
citizen who felt himself isolated, surrounded by a state of 
cavemen. The Cekini family, knowing that the real murderers of 
their son were those who had sent the hitmen Bari, Kubazi, and 
Cela, did not ask for vengeance but justice. However, our 
state, whose filthiest agencies are now implicated in a common 
murder, is now trying to play with the traditions and honesty of 
a highland family like the Cekinis, leaving them to face the 
criminals of Shkoder. Sixty years after Migjeni, these 
highlanders remain the victims of what this writer called "a 
beauty that kills," victims of the silence of a state that 
appears on television with luxurious offices, take-offs and 
landings of aircraft, and the same twisted smiles at official 
receptions. As long as Gjovalin Cekini's murderers are not 
arrested, they are protected by this syrupy "beauty" of the 
state. 
  [Tushe] After being forbidden to hold a meeting at Elbasan, 
the AD was also prevented from holding its planned meetings in 
Reps an Fan of Mirdita on 14 March. Do you see in this an 
escalation of the state's political violence? 
  [Ceko] This action by the police, of course at the orders of 
politicians, shows that the constitution is being violated in 
two ways. First, the most basic political rights are being 
restricted, such as the right to assembly. According to a 
regulation introduced by either nincompoops or people hostile to 
democracy, police permissions must be sought even for meetings 
in indoor halls. This is a violation of the Constitution, for 
which somebody will answer one day. The police officers who 
sign such orders must therefore look for a legal basis for such 
instructions. Second, directors of the Public Order Ministry 
are making open attempts to politicize the police. I sincerely 
advise them to be wary of such steps that not only compromise 
the state but their own futures. 
  Such measures that seem to be sporadic, such as the 
imprisonment of journalists, prohibitions on political 
activities, and assaults on political personalities, indicate a 
strategy of political violence directed against pluralism and 
democracy. There is no evidence that today's rulers have 
neither the economic resources nor the courage to establish a 
dictatorship. At the moment, the evidence is for a restricted 
democracy within the limits accepted by Europe. However, these 
rulers are unable to realize that Europe, and still less a 
people that has just emerged from dictatorship, cannot be taken 
in by a facade. 
  [Tushe] Do you think the Nano trial is part of this 
strategy? 
  [Ceka] Nano's guilt has still not been proved from the 
course of the trial so far, and he therefore still remains a 
political figure. This is therefore an act of political 
violence. Even though Nano is the chairman of a party that the 
AD opposes in the political spectrum and over many basic issues 
in our programs, I cannot accept the savagery with which the 
judiciary has treated him. All this leaves little hope that 
Albanian justice will aquire a European face. This is the 
justice of Brozi's two-rooms-and-a- kitchen or of some filthy 
dossier from the time of the dictatorship. 
  What worries me most of all is that the present economically 
and politically compromised regime, by identifying democracy 
with itself, is playing the way for a prematire resurgence of 
the left. Nano's trial, alongside the blockade of the PS's 
activities with the mobilization of thousands of policemen, is 
giving as a free gift to the Socialists the role of martyrs to 
democracy. 
  I am not sure whether the Socialists will be grateful to the 
present rulers when they take power.

  [Text] Romanian President Ion Iliescu has said that 
relations between his country and Turkey are on the best level 
possible. Iliescu announced that he is waiting impatiently for 
President Suleyman Demirel's visit to further bilateral 
relations. Iliescu made these statements to a group of Turkish 
correspondents in Bucharest while answering their questions on 
bilateral relations and regional issues. Serdar Dimli reports 
from Bucharest: 
  [Begin Dimli recording] Both Iliescu and Romanian Foreign 
Minister Teodor Viorel Melescanu defined the relations between 
Turkey and Romania as excellent. Iliescu said: Our relations 
with Turkey are on the best possible terms and are being 
perpetually furthered in all areas. Demirel's visit will be a 
significant step toward furthering and strengthening these 
relations. We are giving exceptional importance to this 
dialogue in view of the roles both countries play in the 
stability of Europe. 
  In answer to a question on the kind of assistance he expects 
from Turkey regarding Romania's liberalization and privatization 
programs, Iliescu answered: We are currently undergoing the 
same experiences that other countries have gone through and we 
hope to make good use of these in our efforts at liberalization 
and the creation of a market economy. We also want to take 
advantage of Turkey's experience in establishing free economic 
zones since we see this as the most important step toward a 
modern economy. We are still conducting work toward 
establishing free economic zones in Constanta and Sulina on the 
shores of the Black Sea. Joint investment projects to be 
established between the two countries will contribute 
significantly toward the development and externalizing of the 
economies. 
  In answer to another question on his views regarding the 
future of the Romania-Black Sea Economic Cooperation Project and 
on ways to quicken this process, Iliescu said: It is to the 
advantage of all that regional countries develop their relations 
in all areas. Today, however, there is a political stability 
issue in the region and this situation is preventing regional 
countries from furthering their relations. The relations 
between Turkey and Romania should be an example of countries 
that make great efforts to establish stability. This kind of 
cooperation expanding to all the countries in the region will 
contribute toward the development of the project. 
  Romania, a regional country which has common borders with 
Serbia, closely follows the developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and the former Yugoslavia. While answering questions regarding 
this issue, Iliescu said that he does not think a military 
approach to this issue is right. Iliescu said that it is 
necessary to find a peaceful solution to the issue with the help 
of international organizations and other countries. Iliescu 
indicated that the agreement reached between the Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croats could be a good basis for a 
peaceful solution. 
  In answer to a question on Russia's military presence in the 
region, Iliescu said that he is not at all happy with another 
country's military presence in the region.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 22 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) has lost 45.117 billion dollars through the 
disintegration of the former federation and draconic sanctions 
subsequently clamped on the country by the United Nations, show 
figures released on Tuesday by the Yugoslav Science and 
Development Ministry's development and economic policy centre. 
  The U.N. Security Council imposed comrehensive and mandatory 
sanctions on Yugoslavia in May 1992 for the country's alleged 
involvement in civil war raging among the local Moslems, Serbs 
and Croats in the neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Of the 45.117 billion dollars, the loss to the national 
product accounted for 38.136 billion dollars, lost net earnings 
from the abroad for 1.415 billion, lay-over compensation for 436 
million, and humanitarian and economic assistance to the 
refugees and the Serb states in the breakaway Yugoslav republics 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, for a further 5.130 billion 
dollars, the centre's officials said at a press conference. 
  The figure does not include losses incurred through a halted 
scientific and technological development and a brain-drain, 
explained the centre's director Misa Jandric, assistant minister 
for science and development. 
  Furthermore, incalculable damage has been done to 
Yugoslavia's reputation in the world and in international fora 
and to the health, education and culture of the population, 
which have been brought down to an alarmingly low level, said 
Jandric. 
  Should the sanctions remain in place, Yugoslavia stands to 
lose 147.33 billion dollars by the year 2011, the centre 
estimates. 
  A study prepared by the centre indicates that Yugoslavia 
cannot hope to regain the level of economic activity recorded in 
1990 before the year 2012, which brings with itself the threat 
of a slowed development of its neighbors and of Europe as a 
whole. 
  In 1990, Yugoslavia's gross national product stood at 26.6 
billion dollars, to dwindle down to barely 12.57 billion dollars 
in 1993.

  [Text] Zagreb, March 22 (AFP) -- Croatian authorities and 
separatist Serbs began negotiating a ceasefire accord Tuesday 
[22 March] in hopes of building on a Moslem-Croat peace pact in 
neighboring Bosnia. The meeting at the Russian Embassy here, 
organised by Russia's special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Vitaly 
Churkin in coordination with U.S. officials, is the first of its 
kind to be held in the Croatian capital under the auspices of 
the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). 
  The two sides last year held several similar meetings in 
Norway and Austria, with the Serbs demanding neutral territory 
for the talks. But those talks failed because of Serb insistence 
on autonomy for the Krajina region which they have proclaimed an 
independent republic. The separatist Serbs seized the Krajina 
region in the war that broke out between Croatia and the 
Yugoslav army when Zagreb declared independence from the old 
Serb-dominated Yugoslav federation in 1991. 
  John Mills, the spokesman for the international peace 
conference on former Yugoslavia, told journalists the 
discussions would focus on "a comprehensive ceasefire and 
separation of forces" of the two factions. The Krajina Serbs 
occupy a quarter of Croatian territory, and Mills acknowledged 
that separating the two forces was a "very difficult problem." 
  Shortly before the start of the talks, some 300 
intellectuals 
gathered in the centre of the city to protest the start of 
dialogue with the separatists, whom they denounced as "war 
criminals." They accused Russia of making moves to "cement the 
Serb occupation" of Krajina, a UN-monitored area. Questioned on 
the demonstration, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, who has 
ruled out any kind of "enlarged autonomy" for the separatists 
and is demanding the unconditional return of Krajina, told 
journalists that "not only Russian envoys but also those from 
the United States" had entered the talks with the "war 
criminals." He said the U.S. ambassador to Croatia, Peter 
Galbraith, had joined the negotiations. Tudjman stressed the 
talks would continue for as long as was needed to reach a 
solution. "We are obliged to have discussions and we want to do 
so to ensure there are no more (war) victims. We will continue 
talking for as long as there is a chance" of a settlement, he 
said. Tudjman said he had received pledges of support for 
Zagreb's efforts to reassert its authority in Krajina from the 
United States and the UN Security Council, adding that this was 
an essential precondition should Croatia be forced into taking 
"extreme measures" in the event of the talks failing. 
  Tudjman last week asked the Security Council to authorise 
the 
use of force to disarm the rebels. He is insisting that the UN 
peacekeepers, whose mandate for operations in Croatia is up for 
renewal at the end of March, maintain strict control of a 
demarcation line. 
  Churkin has worked closely with his U.S. counterpart Charles 
Redman, who helped broker the Croat-Moslem agreement on a 
federation in Bosnia that was sealed in Washington on Friday [18 
March].

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko </F>
by Piotr Koscinski in Warsaw; date not given: "A Better 
Atmosphere Around Ukraine"] 
  [Text] [Koscinski] Ukraine has decided to hand over all 
of its rockets and nuclear warheads to Russia, where, in line 
with the provisions of START I, they are supposed to be 
destroyed. Do you think the security guarantees received from 
the United States and Russia in return are sufficient for 
Ukraine? 
  [Zlenko] The trilateral Ukrainian-U.S.-Russian declaration, 
signed in Moscow on 14 January, defines quite unequivocally the 
principles on which our national security is to be based. I am 
thinking of such factors as territorial integrity, the 
inviolability of borders, and recognition of the sovereignty and 
independence of our country, as well as the assurance that no 
economic pressure will be exerted on us. I believe that this 
can be fully satisfactory for us. We are currently holding 
concrete talks with many states to prepare a multilateral 
document that will confirm these principles. 
  [Koscinski] It is generally believed that the West 
(especially the United States), in its relations with the states 
of Central and East Europe, is concerned only with Russia and 
that only Russia is of any real importance. What is your 
evaluation of the West's attitude toward Ukraine? 
  [Zlenko] I believe that the contacts between the Ukrainian 
president and his U.S., the results of the recent visit by 
President Leonid Kravchuk to Washington, and the signature of 
the aforementioned trilateral agreement favorably affect Western 
states, which are changing their attitude toward Ukraine. At 
any rate, our country is no longer perceived as a nuclear 
monster that may threaten others. For example, an agreement on 
partnership with the European Union [EU] is expected to be 
signed (today--editor's note); this proves that the atmosphere 
around Ukraine is favorable. We are the first country in CIS to 
sign such an agreement. A positive decision by the EU 
represents a positive decision by its 12 member states. There 
are also other examples that show that the political atmosphere 
is changing to the advantage of Ukraine. 
  [Koscinski] Ukraine proposes establishing a regional 
security zone in Central and East Europe. In the meantime, 
Belarus, which is expected to sign an agreement on monetary 
union with Russia, will enter the sphere of even greater 
political influence from Moscow. How, then, do you envision the 
future of the proposed zone? 
  [Zlenko] Belarus will decide for itself whether or not to 
join that zone. I can speak only about Ukraine. We are very 
interested in creating a zone of stability and security in 
Central and East Europe. Fundamental for us are the proposals 
presented by President Kravchuk. We believe that Poland and 
Ukraine, large countries located in the same region, should very 
soon discuss the principles of both sides' security. We should 
do this bearing in mind the Pact on Stability, proposed by the 
EU, to lead to the establishment of an all-European security 
system.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 23 (AFP) -- The Bosnian Serb army 
has withdrawn some heavy artillery from a disputed location at 
the edge of the 20-kilometre (l2-mile) exclusion zone around the 
capital, UN Protection Force spokesman Simon Macdowall said here 
Wednesday. The Serbs had taken away l3 of 30 artillery pieces, 
leaving the remainder under the supervision of Canadian UNPROFOR 
units who came across the cache last Sunday, Major Macdowall 
said. The weapons left behind included l0 large calibre mortars, 
four howitzers, two T-55 tanks and an anti-aircraft gun. The 
cache was found in Cifluk village north-west of Sarajevo. The 
Serbs said it was just outside the exclusion zone, basing their 
calculations on Sarajevo's traditional centrepoint the 
cathedral. But UNPROFOR's map used a reference point one 
kilometre (slightly more than half a mile) to the west, putting 
Cifluk within the exclusion zone, Macdowall noted. 
  The matter was sorted out late on Monday at Pale, stronghold 
of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic, in talks between 
Bosnian Serb chief Radovan Karadzic and UNPROFOR's Dutch chief 
of staff General Adrian van Baal. The exclusion zone came into 
effect on February 20.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Petr Pravda: "Difficult Conditions Await the </F>
Czech Soldiers in Bosnia"] 
  [Text] A situation that no Czech soldiers have endured 
since World War II awaits the mechanized company from the Czech 
UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) battalion, which should transfer 
in the next few days from Croatian Krajina to Bosnia, in the 
enclaves of Zepce and nearby Zavidovic. 
  Some 120 of our men, along with French and Jordanian 
UNPROFOR 
units, should monitor the situation in currently the most tense 
region of Bosnia, a region in which, to date, there have been no 
international observers or UN troops. The most ferocious 
battles of recent times in Bosnia have been waged some 25 
kilometers away in Maglaj, which is completely surrounded by the 
Serbs. The Serbs have not permitted any humanitarian convoy to 
enter the town for several months. 
  Zepce is a Croatian-Muslim enclave some 60 kilometers north 
of Sarajevo, which, during the first stages of the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, linked Central Bosnia, controlled by the 
Bosnian Sarajevan Government, to the regions of Maglaj and 
Tesanj in the northern part of the former Yugoslav republic. 
  During the course of the war, however, the Serbs succeeded 
in 
cutting a corridor through to Maglaj near the strategically 
located Zepce, and so the 100,000-strong mainly Muslim enclave 
was left completely isolated. 
  The situation is made even more complicated by the fact 
that, 
in Zepce and the surrounding area, everyone has been fighting, 
with intermissions, against everyone else, and expedient 
alliances have been formed. The Muslims, for example, claim 
that the Croatian armed forces allied themselves with the Serbs 
in an offensive against Maglaj. 
  The situation in Zepce itself and the immediate vicinity 
became calm only after the declaration of a cease-fire and the 
start of peace talks between the Croatians and the Bosnian 
Government a few weeks ago. 
  The Serbs, however, are very concerned about a 
Croatian-Muslim alliance and are now making an even greater push 
against nearby Maglaj. People are continuing to live there in 
catastrophic conditions and are virtually entirely dependent on 
the aid dropped to them from aircraft. 
  Just how difficult the conditions in Zepce and the 
surrounding area are is borne out by the information fog that 
prevails around the situation in this region, among other things. 
  UN officials have been unable for several days to provide a 
reliable report on recent developments in the strategic 
situation in Zepce because they have no precise information. 
The UNPROFOR spokesman in Zagreb has merely said that there has 
been no fighting in Zepce, but he has confirmed that the 
situation in the region is very complex. The Czech Defense 
Ministry has been virtually unable to provide any information. 
  The Secretariat of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) in Zagreb, which is responsible for the humanitarian 
convoys to the besieged Bosnian enclaves, stated this week that 
the last aid convoy reached Zepce sometime in the middle of 
February. However, it was only one-third of what this enclave 
actually needs. UNHCR has no permanent staff in Zepce or Maglaj 
and no information about the current situation. 
  The Czech blue berets have, according to Defense Minister 
Baudys, a peaceful mission and should not be involved in the 
battles in the region. They should monitor the situation on the 
front line, which, however, is constantly changing, uphold the 
peace agreement between the warring sides, protect the civilian 
population, and help the humanitarian convoys to get through. 
  Nevertheless, it is extremely likely that our company, just 
like other international units, will be confronted by more than 
one dangerous situation and will not avoid coming into direct 
conflict with the warring sides.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky by Janos </F>
Kobanyai in Sarajevo on 17 March: "We Cannot Take on the Role of 
Mediators"] 
  [Text] Geza Jeszenszky's brief south Slav [Yugoslav] 
visit on 16 and 17 March could also be seen as an airplane show: 
He changed airplanes four times and tried out three different 
types. On the way from Zagreb to Sarajevo, the foreign minister 
and his entourage, together with the whole military region's 
commander in chief and his many associates, were transported by 
a fast passenger carrier. On the way back, we were in the hold 
of a cargo plane together with many containers, and French and 
British UN soldiers. Here, we had the opportunity to interview 
Jeszenszky. 
  [Kobanyai] Having visited Sarajevo, you have now been to all 
three warring south Slav capitals. Do you now have a clear 
picture? 
  [Jeszenszky] Since the outbreak of the south Slav war, the 
intention of Hungarian foreign politics has been clear and 
unaltered: To keep the conflict away from our country and to 
preserve our good-neighborly relations with the old and new 
states. This is not easy, although, at the negotiating tables, 
the hatred that flared up in such a barbaric way between the 
nations cannot be perceived, in fact, all sides keep expressing 
their willingness for compromise. The situation is made more 
complicated by the fact that, in addition to being neighbors, a 
significant Hungarian minority is also living in the countries 
in question and we have to represent their interests and 
alleviate their serious problems caused by the war. 
  An ethnically based explosion makes people suspicious of all 
national minority organizations or demands. For example, after 
tough negotiations with the Croatian side, we have not even been 
able to achieve that they define such administrative boundaries 
in the areas in Baranja that still belongs to them through which 
the Hungarian minority can have a say in local politics. The 
general cultural agreement that has now been signed will provide 
a chance for the attitude that is also the basis of political 
views to change. Rather than Jelacic [Croatian general, led 
army against Hungary in 1848], the Zrinyi brothers [16th-17th 
century Croatian and Hungary family] should be symbols of our 
common past. 
  Our intentions to keep ourselves out of conflicts and to 
prevent further fragmentation have gained respect for our 
country. I and Austrian Foreign Minister Mock are the ones who 
have closely followed the conflict from its beginning, and we 
both have tried to channel the events toward peaceful solutions. 
Without much success, as can be seen. However, we do not have 
the means for it, either. 
  However logical it may seem because of the neighborhood, 
Central European experiences, and the familiarity with 
sensitivities, the role of mediator cannot be accepted because 
we do not have any forces of pressure or counter-forces behind 
us that could be used for achieving compromises. The fact that 
the Bosnian and Croatian sides are requesting peacekeeping 
forces from us demonstrates the respect we have in the region. 
At the moment, this is contrary to our doctrine, namely we 
cannot participate in the armed conflicts of neighboring 
countries, not even as peacemaking forces. 
  However, a number of times, I have offered Budapest for the 
peace negotiations that keep changing site. This site could 
offer a better and more authentic atmosphere due to its 
geographical and intellectual properties. After my visit to 
Sarajevo, I tend to think that these negotiations should be 
conducted in the Bosnian capital. This barren scenery could 
awaken the negotiating sides to the fact that the suffering of 
the innocent population cannot be increased anymore and it would 
compel them to find a peaceful solution, whatever it takes. 
  Hungary is, by all means, interested in peace. The tensions 
that would be relieved by peace could also fill us with 
progressive impulses -- I am thinking of the situation of the 
Hungarian minorities living outside our borders. It would also 
have more tangible positive effects, namely economic ones. 
  I emphasized, at my talks in both Belgrade and Sarajevo, 
that, due to our geographic situation, we would like to play a 
decisive role in restoration. This includes reconstruction and 
longer term work. We would like to get access to new, or 
rather, old markets in the south Slav areas. It can also be 
expected that the new states formed from the former Yugoslavia 
will not trade with each other for a while for emotional 
reasons. With the major restructuring in Eastern and Central 
Europe, we are also having market problems, therefore, a mutual 
interest exists here. 
  However, how could we talk about concrete facts before a 
peaceful settlement is in place, when we have not even been able 
to achieve that we could directly present the much suffered 
Hungarians in Sarajevo with a few crates of aid? 
  [Kobanyai] What is the "message" of the south Slav conflict, 
the Sarajevo syndrome, for Europe? 
  [Jeszenszky] At the beginning of the century, people in this 
region moved around and communicated with each other freely. 
They did not hate each other. This was the work of a handful 
of intelligentsia whose effect increased in certain conflict 
situations. The artificial states created by the peace treaties 
following World War I did not prove viable. The effects of the 
tragedy that was sown at that time can still be felt. The 
"victorious" countries that dictated the peace have also failed 
in the long run. They have also become dependent. All this is 
proved by the south Slav conflict. 
  It is not natural to force people with different cultures 
and traditions to live together. At the same time, small, 
ethnically homogeneous countries are also unviable both from a 
security and an economic point of view. As early as in the 
middle ages, sections of cities, cities, and city alliances of 
different ethnic groups coexisted. They fulfilled supplementary 
functions and organically created the regulatory systems of 
their coexistence. 
  However, freely chosen integration cannot work without an 
external force coming from above. The European Community has to 
fulfill the former role of Vienna. The force that partially 
failed in Sarajevo -- and this is one of the reasons that 
everything that is happening there is pointing beyond itself. 
Up to now, it has only made rather tame steps to curb the 
bloodshed. At the same time, it also has to be seen that events 
would have taken an even more tragic turn without it. 
  Therefore, now, the European thought, the European Community 
as an integrating and conflict-solving force is also being 
tested. 
  In the European integration, the Scandinavian and the 
Benelux 
countries are also maintaining their historically intimate 
relations and their coordinating and conflict preventing 
mechanisms. I see the Central European countries -- which are 
linked together with thousands of historical cords, including 
the injuries suffered from each other -- catching up with the 
European Union in units like these. Austria, Slovenia, and 
Hungary are on this road, and the Croatians also wish to join 
this model, this is one of the reasons it is important for them 
to get out of the Balkans war, even through compromises. I very 
much hope that the idea of the Visegrad group will not be lost, 
either, the positive changes in Slovakia give hope for this. 
  I see Eastern Central Europe's -- including Hungary's -- 
future in this integration of rapprochement that preserves the 
individual characteristics. I believe in this because it is not 
possible to do what I am doing without some kind of image of the 
future.

  [Text] Tirana, March 20 (ATA) -- The Popular [People's] 
Assembly discussed at the yesterday's session the draft law on 
state draft budget for 1994 presented by the Meksi cabinet. 
  Deputy Rakaj, who took the floor in the name of the SDP 
[Socialist Democratic Party] parliamentary group, said the draft 
budget is the main point of the government for the year 1994. 
But it would be better, Rakaj said, if we should have approved 
the platform of the economic reform before the draft budget. 
That is because the platform defines the medium government 
program until 1996. 
  Deputy Angjeli, representative of the SP [Socialist Party] 
parliamentary group, said that the draft budget for 1994 
reflects the economic and financial difficulties our country is 
passing through in this transformation period towards the market 
economy. After he made an analysis in what degree the last year 
budget have been realised, Mr. Angjeli explained the reasons why 
the SP parliamentary group gives an abstention vote. Speaking 
in the name of independent deputies, Deputy Pashko was in favour 
of the abstention, saying the budget shows Albania is going to a 
very social market economy. "We abstain," Pashko said, "because 
we are not for a such market economy." 
  Deputy Jemin Gjana, speaking in the name of DP [Democratic 
Party] parliamentary group, said a special thing in this draft 
law is that discussions, debates, and the confrontations between 
parliamentary members, between parliamentary commissions and 
groups have lasted relatively long showing their responsibility. 
No one, excepting criticizers, can reject the achievements in 
the economic and financial situation, in the bank system, in 
gradual installing and perfecting the fiscal system, in prices 
and salaries policy, in privatization and investments 
continuation and in communication and trade development. These 
achievements were reached by the support of international bodies 
such as EU, World Bank, IMF, G-24, etc. 
  Deputy Gjana mentioned two essential elements of the state 
budget for 1994: expenses for social support will be risen at a 
level of 45 per cent covering 30 per cent of the total expenses 
compared to 25 per cent of the last year. The second element in 
the budget is the raise of the public investments. Their 
program raises by 15 per cent for 1994 covering about 8.5 per 
cent of the GDP [expansion unknown]. 
  "The budget presented to us is a program which expresses all 
the endeavours for building the market economy and the legal 
state," Mr. Gjana said in conclusion. 
  Then Pjeter Arbnori, speaker of the parliament, invited 
deputies to vote for approving the draft project. Taking in 
consideration the remarks and the proposals of parliamentary 
respective commissions and deputies, the draft law on the state 
budget for 1994 was approved in principle, article by article, 
and a majority of votes.

  [Text] Tirana, March 18 (ATA) -- The Supreme Court of 
Appeal decided to change the decision of the Court of Appeal for 
10 former senior officials of the Party of Labour of Albania, 
the spokesman of the court said. 
  Just like the decision of the Tirana District Court, the new 
decision too considers guilty the following: Qirjako Mihali, 
Pali Miska, Besnik Bekteshi, Vangjel Cerrava, Prokop Murra, 
Llambi Gegprifti, Muho Asllani, Hajredin Celiku, Foto Cami, and 
Lenka Cuko for having violated the equality of citizens through 
the creation of privileges for themselves. In a second 
consideration of the case by the Court of Appeal, these former 
leaders were accused of the crime of abuse of office. The 
spokesman explains that the Supreme Court of Appeal changed the 
decision of the Court of Appeal and sent the case for another 
consideration by the first level court. 
  According to the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal, 
the 
civil indictment will be dismissed by the obligation that all 
the defendants will pay back respective amounts of money to the 
Government Service Department. 
  Sentences for the defendants range from 4-7 years of 
imprisonment.

  [Text] Tirana, March 21 (ATA) -- "The organization of the 
Albania's Trade Union says `no' to tendencies manifested by some 
persons who invite it in fighting for early elections," Vilson 
Qendro, secretary general of the Albania's Trade Union, said 
today at the first congress of Albania's Trade Union. Mr. 
Qendro, who held the report on the trade union's activity during 
the 1992-1994 period, emphasized the significant role played by 
trade union in protecting rights and interests of the workers. 
  President of Albania Sali Berisha, who hailed the congress, 
appreciated the trade union's great contribution in democracy's 
victory and its consolidation in Albania. President Berisha 
ranked three main directions in which the trade union's role has 
been especially important and the anticommunist spirit in 
destructing the dictatorship where its contribution has been 
theoretically and practically great. Its very creation as an 
opposition power revealed the hypocrisy of the former party in 
power which claimed to be an workers party. The second 
direction, President Berisha said, is the great trade union's 
role in protecting the rights of the workers. The first 
delegation I received when I was elected president, was a trade 
union one, who told me that we will no more be allies and that 
they would continue their fight to defend the workers's rights 
being an opposition to the government. 
  The third direction, Mr. Berisha pointed out, was the 
confrontation of corruption. "It was you and your newspaper 
SINDIKALISTI," president addressed to participants, "who raised 
the voice against the corruption of the communists. Now you 
confront without compromise the any kind of corruption." 
  Trade union representatives from 30 international trade 
unionist organizations centred in Brussels, representatives from 
Italy, Bulgaria, Turkey, Egypt, Greece, Albanian representatives 
from Kosova and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
[FYROM] took part in the first congress of the Albania's Trade 
Union. 
  The congress will continue its settings on March 22 as well.

  [Text] Tirana, March 21 (ATA) -- Credits for the Bank of 
Albania by governments of European countries started to be 
delivered in different sectors of Albanian economy, sources from 
the Trade Bank of Albania report. 
  The biggest credits come from Germany, Italy, Turkey, 
Greece, 
and Austria. The Italian credit, granted to the Albanian 
Ministry of Industry and Trade, is composed of three parts to be 
paid in 20 years. The two first parts consist of 30 billion 
liras and the rest by 8,878 billion liras. A part of this 
credit, 5,500 billion liras, is supposed to be used in light and 
food industry. The Turkish credit, consisting of 50 million 
dollars, will also be used in three parts. So far only 15 
million dollars from this credit have been used in the light and 
food industry mainly to purchase raw material. The second part 
of the Turkish credit, worth 15 million dollars, is expected to 
be accorded very soon. The Greek credit of 23.4 million dollars 
has to be paid off within five and a half years, and it will be 
invested in agriculture. Meanwhile from the credit of 42 
million schillings by the Austrian Government, 770 thousands 
schillings are being used in the Construction Ministry of 
Albania. In regard to the German credit, 5 million have been 
used in the reconstruction of the "Studenti" Campus in Tirana. 
The second part of the German credit at a level of 7 million DM 
[German marks] is being used in the agriculture sector, while 
the light and food industry is using 5 million DM from this 
credit.

  [Text] Tirana, March 22 (ATA) -- "All the possibilities 
exist for more intense relations in all fields between our two 
countries," President Berisha said in yesterday's meeting with 
German parliamentarians headed by Mr. Michael Glos. 
  Mr. Berisha said he was grateful to Germany and German 
parliament for their support to Albania from the very beginning 
of the democratic processes. President Berisha also called for 
the Germany's support for Albania's integration in the European 
institutions. 
  Mr. Berisha said Germany should make its contribution to a 
fair resolution to the crises in Balkans. "In this context," 
President Berisha said, "removal or facilitation in the UN 
embargo on Serbia would escalate the conflict and destabilize 
the situation in the region." 
  The German parliamentarians thanked President Berisha for 
the 
presentation of the situation in Albania. They highly 
appreciated the achievements of democracy in Albania and 
promised they will make their contribution to Albania in a 
concrete and effective assistance of Germany to it. 
  The German parliamentarians were received yesterday by the 
president of the Democratic Party, Eduard Selami.

  [Text] Tirana, 22 March (ATA) -- The German Government 
decided to take back four tons of German expired pesticides 
which are in Albania since 1992 and which are presenting a 
threat to the environment. 
  Federal minister of environment and protection of nature, 
Klaus Toepfer, said at a press release that "as far as I know 
the pesticides have been illegally exported to Albania. There 
derives no obligation to take them back. But we accept that it 
is an inheritance from the unification of the two Germanies. In 
order to avoid grave consequences in the foreign policy, we 
shall make a human gesture by taking the pesticides back." 
  The pesticides have been brought in barrels on a train to 
Albania in March 1992 and have been centred mostly in the border 
railway station of Bajze, near Shkoder. Among the pesticides, 
according to specialists, there is toxaphene whose usage has 
been banned in the European Union countries since 10 years ago. 
"The death train," as the Albanian press refers to it, has come 
to Albania as an humanitarian aid from the "Schmidt Cretan GmbH" 
company of Hanover. As time has passed, the pesticides have 
ruined the barrels and leaked on the ground, thus threatening 
for polluting the Shkoder Lake, which borders Albania and 
Montenegro. The German Government has planned to take the 
pesticides back by sea within May.

Berov is in good condition a week after major by-pass surgery,

well as his other organs and systems, are functioning normally.

postoperative treatment and exercise. In a conversation today 
with Yunal Lyutfi of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms the prime minister said he would be back to work soon. 
Lyutfi quoted Berov's words in an informal conversation in

Medical Academy. Berov takes eight steps every day. Twenty days 
after the operation he will move to Bankya near Sofia for 
further treatment.

  [Text] Sofia, March 22 (BTA) -- Bulgaria and Slovenia 
share a desire to expand contacts and hold similar positions on 
a number of international issues, Foreign Minister Stanislav 
Daskalov said today on his return from a three-day visit to 
Slovenia. It has been the first visit at this level since 
Slovenia became independent. 
  The sides reviewed bilateral relations and expressed a 
desire 
to build a legal basis for contacts, Daskalov said. In 
Ljubljana he met with his counterpart Lojze Peterle and was 
received by President Milan Kucan, Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek 
and Parliament Chairman Herman Rigelnik. The foreign ministers 
signed an agreement on cooperation in culture, education and 
science. 
  Daskalov said that a trade agreement and probably an 
investment promotion agreement would be signed in Sofia in 
April. Agreements on double taxation relief and transport 
cooperation are also expected to be signed in the near future. 
  The two countries hold similar views on the crisis in the 
former Yugoslavia and the efforts of Bulgaria and Slovenia to 
become integrated into Europe, according to Daskalov. He said 
the two countries would open talks on establishing a free trade 
zone, perhaps during the visit here by Slovenia's Minister for 
Foreign Economic Relations Davorin Kracun on April 20, according 
to the Bulgarian foreign minister.

  [Text] Sofia, March 22 (BTA) -- "We won't have accusations 
that the Turkish minority in this country is disloyal to the 
state," the leadership of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms (DPS) said in a declaration adopted today. It came 
in response to yesterday's allegations by Krasimir Premyanov MP 
of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), member of the BSP top 
leadership, that Bulgarian Turks were arming themselves. The 
DPS described Premyanov's allegations as a "provocation" and "a 
flagrant anti-constitutional act aimed to stir up interethnic 
hatred in the Bulgarian people." 
  The DPS leaders believe that certain elements in the BSP 
want 
to play the nationalistic card again, Yunal Lyutfi, spokesman 
for the DPS parliamentary group, told the press. Such lies and 
provocations could be of benefit only to those who do not care 
about the country's future, Lyutfi said. The parliamentary 
group of the DPS discussed a possible motion for stripping 
Premyanov of immunity but no decision was taken. The matter 
will be further debated tomorrow, Lyutfi said. 
  The Interior Ministry said today that police authorities 
have 
no information on organized arming of the population in areas 
predominantly populated by ethnic Turks or elsewhere in the 
country, nor have they discovered illegal arms caches. The 
regional directorates of the interior in Shumen and Razgrad 
(towns in a mixed-population region in northeastern Bulgaria) 
also denied Premyanov's allegations. The Razgrad Regional 
Directorate of the Interior has no information about stockpiling 
of weapons in the area under its charge, Major Atanas Atanasov, 
chief of the directorate, said today. The leaders of the Shumen 
Directorate of the Interior were even more categorical in their 
denial of the allegations. 
  "I spoke in a private capacity yesterday and what I said 
does 
not bind the parliamentary group of the BSP, its leadership and 
the party leadership," Premyanov told a regular BSP news 
conference today. He confirmed the credibility of the 
information he disclosed yesterday as well as of the tip-offs, 
some which had been addressed to him and some of which were 
highly credible. Premyanov said he would wait for the competent 
authorities to pronounce on some of the tip-offs. 
  Premyanov stressed that in his statement he had not 
identified any political force or leader. "I daren't claim that 
this is being done on an ethnic or a clear-cut political basis," 
Premyanov said. He said that on his initiative the BSP had 
contacted the interior minister and the chief of the National 
Security Service to give them the witnesses' whereabouts and the 
exact locations. "I would very much like this undertaking to be 
unconnected with the context of the Balkan region," Premyanov 
said.

  [Text] Spindleruv Mlyn, east Bohemia, March 19 (CTK) -- 
Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Saturday [19 March] 
that the Ministry of the Environment and the work of Environment 
Minister Frantisek Benda were lacking in concept. 
  At a press conference during a meeting of the Executive 
Council of Klaus' Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the prime 
minister said he would therefore begin "fundamental discussions" 
with the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) on solving the 
problems in this area. Benda is a member of the KDS. 
  Following the dismissal of Deputy Environment Minister Petr 
Gandalovic (ODS), the ODS has lost contact with this ministry, 
Klaus said. 
  The Executive Council also appointed a committee to draft a 
bill which would set a final limit on who would be eligible to 
receive compensation for suffering endured during the communist 
period. ODS Chairman and Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus 
emphasized that the matter did not mean the end of general 
restitution of property. 
  The committee will be headed by ODS Vice Chairman Jiri 
Vlach. 
  Klaus said the number of cases concerning the redress of the 
most serious grievances had passed its limit. "I fear that by 
drawing things out extensively, we could reach the absurd 
conclusion that every citizen was aggrieved during his life 
under the communist regime," he said.

  [Text] Prague, March 22 (CTK) -- Journalists estimate that 
around 40,000 people attended today's demonstration called by 
the Bohemian and Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS) today 
at 12:00 PM in Prague's Old Town Square to warn the government 
and parliament that "the situation of employees and pensioners 
is becoming unbearable." 
  The demonstration was addressed by CMKOS Chairman Vladimir 
Petrus, who said that the unions could not be accused of 
extremism. The unionists merely considered it their 
responsibility to point out that "dissatisfaction of the people" 
threatened. They were not therefore going against parliament, 
but they asked that the government and parliament "showed social 
perceptiveness." 
  At the end of the demonstration the participants approved 
appeals to the government and to parliamentary deputies, which 
states that the union members "consider it very dangerous when 
even government bills contain attempts to transfer the burden of 
essential economic reforms on to those least able to protect 
themselves." 
  It asks ministers that the amendment to the labor code and 
the basis of the law on pension insurance be not put before 
parliament until they are properly prepared and take into 
account the union members' comments. 
  In the appeal addressed to deputies, the union members point 
to their demands concerning the making of repeated contracts, 
the position of pregnant women and mothers with small children, 
the increase in the pension age, the management of money set 
aside for pension insurance and the ban on trade union activity 
in the civil service. 
  The demonstrators were also greeted by General Secretary of 
the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, Enzo 
Friso, who assured them of the confederation's support. 
  Messages from foreign organizations. [sentence as received] 
Concrete support was expressed by the Polish trade union 
movement Solidarity, which managed to drive radio cars with 
loudspeakers to Prague overnight, after the demonstration's 
organizers had not been able to get hold of any in the Czech 
Republic. 
  Czech Minister of Employment and Social Affairs Jindrich 
Vodicka also came to the Old Town Square, but he was for the 
most part greeted with whistles and various displays of 
indignation. Union members came to Prague from all over the 
Czech Republic in 400 buses, and filled most of the square.

  [Text] Prague, March 22 (CTK) -- Basic questions are not, 
in the contemporary Czech Republic, decided at demonstrations 
but in parliament, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus said today, 
commenting on the midday trade union demonstration in Prague's 
Old Town Square. 
  He said the demonstration was organized by a "partial" group 
of inhabitants. While this sort of thing may have been all right 
in February 1948, it was no good for March 22, 1994, he told 
journalists. 
  Today's demonstration was organized by the Bohemian and 
Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS) in support of the 
withdrawal of the amendment to the employment code from 
parliament's March agenda, which begins today. The union 
members' biggest objections concerned the articles on the 
possibility of concluding repeated fixed-period contracts and on 
night work by pregnant women. 
  Unionists have negotiated these demands with the government 
and have attended the meetings of individual parliamentary 
committees, where they said they met with a lack of 
understanding of people's situations and therefore decided to 
call today's demonstration.

  [Text] Prague, March 22 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav 
Klaus said on Czech Radio today that he was not willing to 
comment on today's trade union demonstration, saying that the 
government "did not have the smallest scrap of a share in the 
demonstration," and that it "bore no relation to the government 
at all." The demonstration was organized in Prague's Old Town 
square by the Bohemian and Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions 
(CMKOS). Journalists estimated it was attended by 40,000 people. 
  He said he believed negotiations between the government and 
the unions were held in a manner that was completely correct. 
The government had accepted many of the points made by the 
unions concerning the amendment to the employment code, and so 
to say it had not consulted the unions on the matter was "utter 
lies and falsehood." 
  However, he said, the government did not have to accept all 
the unions' comments, "as some of the union leaders seem to 
wish." 
  Klaus said he had been receiving reports from all over the 
country concerning pressure placed on union members, who were 
offered a free ride to Prague in order to take part in some kind 
of demonstration for a bit. This action by unions was being 
revealed by "telephones, faxes and letters by people from all 
over the Republic," he said.

  [Text] Prague, March 22 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav 
Havel said today the process of transformation of the Czech Army 
could be evaluated favorably. "But we will only be able to make 
a definitive assessment after 1995 when the transformation will 
be completed," he told CTK after he visited the army's General 
Staff. 
  Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said that the largest amount 
of work was awaiting the army this year and in the first half of 
1995. 
  Havel said he was very pleased "to hear now, when the Dutch 
queen is visiting the Czech Republic, a report about the very 
successful joint exercise with a Dutch unit, the first ever 
exercise with a Western army on our soil." The exercise started 
in mid-March and is to finish on March 24.

  [Text] Prague, March 22 (CTK) -- Czech Social Democratic 
Party (CSSD) Chairman Milos Zeman has started his great 
offensive with coming of spring, the left-oriented RUDE PRAVO 
writes today. 
  After having welcomed three former members of the Civic 
Movement (OH) to his party on Friday [18 March], Zeman was 
already fishing in other waters on Monday [21 March] -- for the 
first time he called on former Communists not to create new 
parties such as the Democratic Left Party (SDL) or the Left 
Block Party (SLB) but to join the Social Democrats, thus 
strengthening them. 
  Zeman has put, however, two conditions -- former Communists 
will have to have "clean hands" from the past and they must 
"sincerely distance themselves from the communist ideology." It 
will apparently be the CSSD local branches who will judge who of 
the former Communists have distanced themselves from the 
communist ideology and how sincerely and whether or not their 
hands are clean, the paper says. 
  It is thus not surprising that SDL Chairman Josef Mecl 
promptly reacted to the proposal, arguing that "he did not want 
to let himself be dragged into `screening trap of the Social 
Democrats'." SLB deputy chairman Jaroslav Ortman was more 
cautious, merely noting that he did want to doubt the 
correctness of the SLB as a political party. 
  However, both Mecl and Ortman made sure that their remarks 
about the necessity of cooperation between left-wing parties be 
noticed. Ortman said that such cooperation would be untenable 
[as received] during the senatorial elections and that leftist 
parties should offer a joint slate in the local elections in the 
Czech Republic in November. Zeman could therefore be satisfied 
with the first reaction of both the SDL and SLB. And as regards 
the abolition of the two parties and transfer of their members 
to the CSSD, here Zeman is clearly playing for time. The former 
Democratic Party of Labor (DSP) opposed a similar fate tooth and 
nail and look how active its former deputy chairman and 
parliamentary deputy Michal Kraus is in the CSSD now, the paper 
writes.

<F P=106> [Article signed MPK/GGD: "Belgian Foreign Minister Claes -- </F>
Czech Republic `At Top of List' for European Union Membership"; 
as released by Belga Database] 
  [Excerpt] Prague, 21 Mar (BELGA) -- On Monday, during the 
second day of his official visit to Prague, Belgian Foreign 
Minister Willy Claes said: "The Czech Republic is the 
best-placed country of Central Europe to enter the European 
Union (EU)," although it is not currently possible to set a 
precise date because the EU will need to be strengthened before 
any further enlargement. 
  At a news conference after a meeting with his Czech 
counterpart, Jozef Zieleniec, Claes added that the Czech 
Republic will, however, have to accept the Community standards 
if it wants to join the EU, since there is no question of again 
playing the "British game of opt outs." 
  Asked by Czech journalists if the Czech Republic could join 
the EU before the end of the century, Claes reiterated the need 
to first strengthen the EU. He predicted, however, that the 
situation developing in Russia could accelerate European 
integration. 
  In this respect, the Belgian foreign minister urged the 
Greek 
presidency to ensure that the association treaty signed between 
the EU and the Czech Republic last November is ratified as soon 
as possible. 
  Claes also insisted that the EU would not treat the 
enlargement negotiations as one package and that one country of 
the Visegrad group (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and 
Hungary) could well gain EU membership before the others. He 
added: "I am convinced that the Czech Republic will soon meet 
the economic conditions for membership." 
  Claes had previously met with the president of the Czech 
parliament and members of the parliamentary Foreign Affairs and 
Defense Committees. Czech deputies had reminded him of their 
"slight disappointment" at not being able to join NATO 
immediately. The Foreign Affairs Committee chairman said, 
regrettably: "We want to base our action on a policy of 
alliance. We do not want to be neutral. The Partnership for 
Peace (a type of strengthened cooperation between NATO and the 
countries of Eastern Europe) is a simple form of cooperation." 
  Speaking to the journalists about the Czech 
"disappointment," 
Claes stressed that, even if Russia belonged to the Partnership 
for Peace, that would not give it the right to have any say in 
the enlargement of NATO. 
  This is the first visit by a Belgian foreign minister to the 
Czech Republic, and Foreign Ministry sources say that the two 
countries are envisaging adapting and renewing bilateral 
agreements. New agreements in the areas of air transport, road 
transport, investment, and taxation are expected to be 
concluded. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prague, March 22 (CTK) -- The majority of Czech 
citizens (65 percent) firmly believe that no further property 
should be returned to the former aristocracy and 42 percent 
oppose the restitution of church property, according to a poll 
conducted in March by the Institute for Public Opinion Research 
(IVVM) among 835 people over age 15. 
  Only two percent of those polled were definitely for the 
return of property to aristocrats and eight percent were 
definitely for the return of church property. 
  A total of 58 percent of the respondents said they were 
against the return of property to people who emigrated from 
Czechoslovakia and did not come back while only three percent 
said they favored the return of their property. 
  The restitution of church property and the return of 
property 
to emigrants was supported mostly by inhabitants of North 
Moravia. 
  Views of potential voters for various political parties 
differed considerably. Among those who favor the restitution of 
church property, 28 percent would vote for the Civic Democratic 
Party (ODS), 11 percent the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), 11 
percent for the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), and four 
percent the Left Bloc (LB). 
  Among those who support the return of property to 
aristocrats 
19 percent would vote ODS, 8 percent ODA, 6 percent CSSD, and no 
one LB. 
  The return of property to Jewish communities is supported by 
54 percent of ODS voters, 50 percent CSSD, and 20 percent LB.

  [Text] Prague, March 22 (CTK) -- Sixty-one percent of 
Czechs believe that the government is working well, while only 
36 per cent think the same about parliament, according to a poll 
conducted by the Center for Empirical Research (STEM) among 
1,627 Czechs earlier in March. The evaluation of the work of 
the government and parliament worsened against a similar poll 
from February by six and two per cent respectively. 
  Czech President Vaclav Havel is trusted by 69 percent of 
those polled, Premier Vaclav Klaus by 70 per cent and Parliament 
Chairman Milan Uhde by 41 per cent. Citizen confidence in these 
politicians slightly declined against the February results. 
  Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, favored 
by 
86 percent of Czech citizens, remains the most popular 
politician. Klaus placed second (73 per cent), and Foreign 
Minister Josef Zieleniec third (69 per cent). 
  In comparison with the February poll, the most marked 
decline 
of popularity was registered with Defense Minister Antonin 
Baudys (from 52 to 32 percent) and Agriculture Minister Josef 
Lux (from 41 to 33 percent). 
  The poll showed a permanent increase in preferences for 
Zieleniec and recently appointed Culture Minister Pavel Tigrid, 
who was favored by 59 per cent of those questioned.

  [Text] Prague, March 22 (CTK) -- Almost two-thirds of 
Czechs think citizens should not be equal before the law, and 
over half think legislation should be different and tougher for 
Romanies (Gypsies), a recent poll reveals. 
  While 53 percent of those questioned believe Gypsies ought 
to 
be singled out, other minority groups cited as deserving special 
legal attention are Vietnamese citizens living in the Czech 
Republic, in the opinion of 6.3 percent, refugees (according to 
5.8 percent) and skinheads (4.2 percent). 
  Thirteen per cent of respondents said they felt repeat 
offenders and criminal elements should be placed lower on a 
hierarchical scale before the law. 
  As regards the respondents' level of education, seventy-one 
percent of people with basic education hold the above views, as 
opposed to 56 percent of those with a school leaving certificate 
and 50 percent of higher educational students. 
  The view that Romanies should face tougher laws seems to be 
linked to indifference to the preservation of Romanies' 
distinctive lifestyle. Only six per cent of people questioned 
consider more care should be taken to respect Romanies' rights. 
  The poll was conducted by STEM, the Prague Empirical 
Research 
Center, in March. 1,627 people over the age of 18 were 
questioned. A STEM poll carried out last May showed that only 
one percent of Czechs trusted Gypsies and 72 percent said they 
would find it very hard to tolerate having a Romany neighbor. As 
many as 88 percent then said a Romany son- or daughter-in-law 
would be totally unacceptable.

  [Text] Budapest, 22 March (MTI) -- As was reported 
earlier, Hungarian parliament's plenary session on Tuesday [22 
March] passed a resolution, without any votes against, on 
submission of Hungary's membership request to the European 
Union. Under the terms of the resolution, Parliament authorizes 
the government to submit the application to the Commission of 
the European Union [EU]. 
  Prior to the vote, Prime Minister Peter Boross noted that 
representatives of the parliamentary parties spoke with approval 
concerning Hungary's membership in the EU. 
  Deputies also approved a draft resolution on assistance to 
the national and ethnic minority organizations. Accordingly, of 
the 220 million forints approved, the individual federations of 
minorities in Hungary will receive 130 million forints, while 
the remaining 90 million forints will be distributed among the 
78 Gypsy organizations. 
  In 1994, the largest budget assistance of 36.4 million 
forints is to be given to the Federation of Germans in Hungary. 
The Democratic Federation of Slovaks in Hungary is to receive 
23.5 million forints, the Federation of Croats in Hungary 21.1 
million, the Democratic Federation of Romanians in Hungary 13.4 
million. 
  Parliament also approved the law on prevention of money 
laundering through money and capital market systems. The law 
obliges financial servicing organizations to identify the client 
in cases of cash deposits or payments of 2 million forints or 
more.

  [Text] Turin, 20 March (MTI) -- "Hungary looks with hope 
to the new Slovak Government. A new government, whatever its 
composition, offers a new opportunity for a dialogue, which we 
have always encouraged," Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said 
in Turin on Sunday [20 March]. 
  Jeszenszky, who attended a series of events marking the 
death 
centenary of 1848-49 Hungarian freedom fight leader Lajos 
Kossuth (1802-1894, died in Turin), spoke to MTI about 
Hungarian-Slovak links after the Bratislava government crisis, 
and the future of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia. 
  "When Hungary congratulated the newly-independent Slovakia, 
it stressed that the good wishes are also for the ethnic 
Hungarians living there. We feel reconciliation between 
Slovakia and Hungary is possible, but only if preceded by a 
compromise between Hungarians and Slovaks in Slovakia," 
Jeszenszky said. 
  He recalled his repeated negotiations with the new Prime 
Minister Jozef Moravcik, who was then foreign minister, on the 
minority problem. "I hope that the new Slovak Government will 
strive to create friendship between the two countries and their 
peoples in keeping with its original program, instead of 
fabricating artificial enemy pictures and enemies," the foreign 
minister added. 
  Regarding Saturday's rock concerts held in several large 
towns of the world at the call of Sarajevo Radio to protest 
against the raising of a new "wall" in the Bosnian capital, 
Jeszenszky -- who visited Sarajevo early this week -- pointed 
out: 
  "Everything possible should be done to prevent repetition of 
the Berlin Wall, and to promote unification of still divided 
towns in Europe and elsewhere. Administrative borders must be 
freely crossable: They can separate certain communities, but 
they must not separate the people.

  [Text] Budapest, March 22 -- According to Hungarian 
President Arpad Goncz, Polish-Hungarian friendship is and will 
always be topical and the present political situation prompts 
Warsaw and Budapest to have even closer contacts than so far. 
The slogan: Poles and Hungarians are friends will always be 
topical, Goncz told Polish correspodents in Budapest on Tuesday, 
before his three-day visit to Warsaw, Poznan and Krakow to start 
on March 28. 
  Pointing to the will to become integrated with western 
Europe, common to Poland and Hungary, President Goncz said that 
Poland should be the closest and most important partner for 
Budapest. He stressed also the importance of the Visegrad group 
and said that he believed in the concept of central Europe, 
although it could be interpreted differently. 
  Referring to his planned meetings with Polish politicians, 
particularly with President Lech Walesa and Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak, the head of the Hungarian state said that 
mutual presentation of views would be very important for the 
better understanding of both countries.

  [Text] Budapest, 22 March (MTI) -- "The event of the day 
is in the parliament," Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman 
told the press on Tuesday [22 March], referring to the Tuesday 
morning plenary session on Hungary's application for membership 
of the European Union. 
  In view of the defective Gabcikovo sluice chambers, the 
Hungarian Government has called on countries which insist on the 
principle of free navigation on the Danube, which conduct 
shipping traffic on the river, and which signed the 1948 
Belgrade Convention on the Order of Navigation, to warn the 
Slovak Government to immediately stop the law-breaking action 
and ensure free passage, Herman said. He drew attention to the 
Slovak Government's responsibility for the cessation of shipping 
on the Danube due to a technical and professional error. 
  After the first sluice chamber accident, the Hungarian 
Government warned the Slovak Government of the possibility of 
the second chamber going wrong, and asked it to do its best to 
make the given river section navigable. There was no Slovak 
response to this request, Herman said. 
  Answering a question, the spokesman said that the building 
of 
version "C," and thus the recent accident, was to be blamed on 
former Slovak Governments, while Hungary would welcome possible 
negotiations with the new Slovak cabinet on boosting bilateral 
links. 
  Herman reported fair progress in preparations for a 
"supervisory" conference of the 1992 Helsinki Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, to be held in Budapest's 
Convention Center from October 10 to December 2, and subsequent 
summit meetings from December 5-6. 
  He finally announced the March 24 visit to Hungary of Peter 
Tarnoff, deputy undersecretary of state in charge of East 
European affairs at the U.S. State Department, who will study 
the region's situation and discuss NATO's Partnership for Peace.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD/RHR: "Jean-Luc Dehaene Invites </F>
Hungarian Prime Minister To Belgium"; as released by Brussels 
BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Budapest, 21 Mar (BELGA) -- On Monday Belgian Prime 
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene invited Hungarian Prime Minister Peter 
Boross to visit Belgium. 
  On the second day of his official visit to Hungary, Dehaene 
had talks on Monday with leading Magyar political, economic, 
financial, and social figures. The Belgian prime minister also 
met with President Arpad Goncz and Assembly President Gyorgy 
Szabad. 
  At a joint news conference, Dehaene and Boross both stressed 
that Belgium and Hungary -- which is seeking closer ties with 
the West -- largely share the same approach to Europe's future. 
"We support Hungary's role as the driving force" in the process 
of integrating Central European countries into European 
structures, a process which must be progressive, stated the 
Belgian prime minister, who arrived in Hungary on Sunday for a 
three-day official visit. 
  Boross stressed that Hungary -- one of the first countries 
to 
have implemented reforms prior to the collapse of communism -- 
would need several years in order to attain the level of 
economic development required for European Union (EU) 
membership. He added that current reforms had set his country 
"on the right road" and noted that EU membership would be 
important for Hungary's security. 
  Dehaene's trip comes less than two months after the entry 
into force of the Association Treaty between Hungary and the EU. 
  Speaking of the Partnership for Peace -- NATO's initiative 
to 
improve cooperation with its former enemies and which Hungary 
joined on 8 February -- Dehaene confirmed that the 
implementation of this program should perhaps be speeded up. 
  "Hungary signed the Partnership for Peace to be able to move 
closer to NATO, which would represent total security for the 
country," Boross said at the same news conference. 
  Hungary is ready to compromise on the question of national 
minorities, added Boross, referring to the conference on 
stability in Europe convened at the proposal of French Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur and to be held in Paris on 26 and 27 
May to discuss the situation of minorities. 
  Dehaene is to lunch on Tuesday with the Hungarian secretary 
of state for minorities. He will also meet representatives from 
the opposition parties in parliament, namely the SzDSz [Alliance 
of Free Democrats], the Socialist Party (the former Communist 
MSZP or Hungarian Socialist Party), and the Fidesz [Federation 
of Young Democrats]. After a sightseeing tour of Budapest, he 
will return to Brussels on Tuesday afternoon.

  [Text] Budapest, 21 Mar (MTI) -- Belgian Prime Minister 
Jean-Luc Dehaene, on an official visit to Hungary, on Monday 
heard Hungarian parliament Foreign Affairs Committee talks on 
NATO and minorities. 
  Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Laszlo Kovacs (Hungarian 
Socialist Party) said after the meeting that MPs were unified on 
full membership being of fundamental importance for Hungary. 
There was also agreement on Hungary's wish that countries in 
Central Europe be treated individually for application. 
  Kovacs said that the new Hungarian Government to be formed 
after the elections will have to try to help minorities outside 
Hungary with better bilateral relations with the countries 
concerned. The socialists also agree that international forums 
should be used to create an effective minority protection system. 
  Committee Deputy Chairman Gyorgy Csoti (Hungarian Democratic 
Forum) said his party feels the rights of Hungarians living 
beyond the borders should be ensured as the first step, as good 
neighbourly relations are inconceivable without this. Still, 
the HDF believes in constant dialogue with neighbours. They 
agree with the socialists that guarantees that cannot be 
elaborated on bilateral bases should be given to minorities 
internationally. 
  Over relations with NATO, the views of the two parties 
differ. According to the HSP, NATO would best serve stability 
were the countries of the region to receive identical security 
guarantees. These might or might not be linked to membership. 
The HSP considers the peace partnership programme as a 
compromise which does not exclude one single country. 
  The HDF believes all countries of the region should receive 
security guarantees at the same time, and in their view, the 
peace partnership embodies this. The HDF expects NATO to define 
a clear system of criteria by which countries of the region can 
win membership in the North Atlantic Alliance.

  [Text] Budapest, 22 March (MTI) -- As was reported 
earlier, Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene met with 
leaders of several Hungarian parliamentary parties on Tuesday 
[22 March], prior to leaving Budapest. 
  Chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] Lajos Fur 
said the parliamentary elections scheduled for May will be vital 
to the future of the Hungarian nation. Following the creation 
of the system of political institutions, the switch to a social 
market economy must be implemented in the next four years, he 
said. 
  Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats 
[Fidesz], stressed that the opposition parties are also 
committed to Hungary's membership in the European Union. 
  During his meeting with the Belgian prime minister, Chairman 
of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] Ivan Peto, stressed 
the importance of the May parliamentary elections in terms of 
the young Hungarian democracy. He noted that both society and 
politicians are only now learning of the consequences that can 
accompany a possible change in government within a democratic 
system. 
  Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party 
[MSZP], 
told Dehaene that the MSZP supports NATO's peace-partnership 
conception. Perhaps the only objection would be that, in cases 
of conflict, the consultation opportunities seem weak. 
  Dehaene was seen off at Budapest's Ferihegy Airport by 
Chairman of the Christian Democratic People's Party Laszlo 
Surjan. In the course of their brief discussions, the Belgian 
prime minister stressed high appreciation for the political 
stability experienced, which is unique in the region.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 21 -- Minister of Foreign Affairs of 
Ukraine Anatoliy Zlenko, on a two-day visit to Poland, and his 
Polish counterpart Andrzej Olechowski declared Monday that 
Poland and Ukraine -- which are strategic partners -- will 
strive for "close partnership", trying to intensify mutual 
contacts in the coming months. 
  The ministers made the declaration following their 
face-to-face meeting during which they also signed a declaration 
on principles of shaping the Polish-Ukrainian partnership and an 
inter-governmental agreement on the protection of graves and 
memorials to victims of war and repression.

Polish- Ukrainian partnership. Minister Zlenko added that 
intensified Polish-Ukrainian relations might play an important 
role in the region and in entire Europe. The ministers also 
touched upon European security and international situation. 
  Minister Olechowski was invited to pay a visit to Ukraine. A 
meeting between the prime ministers of the two countries is also 
scheduled to take place soon but its exact date is not known yet.

responsible for preparing a timetable and drafts of 
Polish-Ukrainian cooperation. Olechowski will appoint an expert 
in a week's time. The respective ambassadors of Poland and 
Ukraine will also participate in the work of the team.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 22 -- Visiting Foreign Minister of 
Ukraine Anatoliy Zlenko said on Tuesday the strategic base of 
Polish-Ukraine partnership relations should be both countries' 
national security. 
  "Ukraine and Poland are two big partners in our subregion, 
and the deepening of their mutual relations may have a 
significant meaning for the entire region, and may become an 
example of jointly naming and solving concrete problems," said 
Zlenko during a press conference on the second and last day of 
his visit to Poland. 
  The Ukrainian guest said he is satisfied with the talks with 
Polish politicians. He said he discussed with Polish Foreign 
Minister Andrzej Olechowski Ukraine's possible access to the 
France-German-Poland axis. 
  He said he also discussed the filling of the security vacuum 
in central and eastern Europe and the creation of a joint 
collective security system.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 22 -- President Lech Walesa on Tuesday 
received visiting Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko to 
discuss ways of broadening Polish-Ukrainian cooperation and to 
fill the existing agreements with "concrete substance." 
  Lech Walesa said that Poland understands problems faced by 
Ukraine. "Ukraine may become a great country but it must gain 
economic independence. And we will strive for such 
independence," the president said. 
  He confirmed his earlier statements that there is no free 
Poland without free Ukraine and said that what we need now are 
actions, we should look for possibilities of close, concrete 
cooperation. 
  Also Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak received the Ukrainian 
guest to discuss the most important issues in relations between 
both neighbours. Both politicians agreed that their countries 
are failing to use up all possibilities of cooperation at 
present. 
  Deputy Senate Speaker Zofia Kuratowska and the Ukrainian 
foreign minister agreed that geographical location of Poland and 
Ukraine was of strategic significance for the security of Europe 
and stressed the need for developing close economic as well as 
political and cultural contacts. 
  Both sides examined also national minority questions in the 
two countries, with Kuratowska deeming it necessary to hold a 
bilateral working conference to review minority questions. 
  Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski and the Ukrainian guest 
signed a declaration on principles of shaping Polish-Ukrainian 
partnership and agreement on protection of graves and 
remembrance sites. 
  Zlenko told reporters that the ensuring of national security 
of both countries should become a strategic basis for 
partnership between Poland and Ukraine. 
  In the Centre for Eastern Studies he spoke about current 
international situation and the Ukrainian foreign policy.

  [Text] Warsaw, 22 March (MTI) -- Hungary may submit its 
membership application to the European Union on March 31, and it 
seems probable that Poland will take the same step at that time, 
State Secretary of the Hungarian Foreign Ministry Janos Martonyi 
told MTI's Warsaw correspondent. 
  Martonyi arrived for a visit to Poland on Saturday [19 
March] 
to open the Hungarian Consulate in Krakow, for the time being 
only a symbol, as actual work will begin later. The state 
secretary said the main aim of his visit was to hold 
consultations with senior officials from the Polish Foreign 
Ministry, mainly in an effort to coordinate European integration 
policy. 
  "The reason is that we consider Polish-Hungarian cooperation 
to be of strategic importance, and this remains key to the whole 
of the region," Martonyi said. 
  Talks with Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski and his 
assistants, and with members of Polish Parliament's Foreign 
Affairs and European Relations Committees, served this end, as 
well as the furthering of bilateral relations. 
  Martonyi said that like the Hungarian, Polish foreign policy 
also considers the Visegrad cooperation (between Poland, Czech 
Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary) to be alive and important. The 
free trade zone taking shape creates a good basis for developing 
relations in other areas as well.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES 22/3/1994 -- In an interview 
granted to the government daily VOCEA ROMANIEI, the Romanian 
Minister of National Defence Gheorghe Tinca says that the 
Romanian Army is now in "a stage of modernisation taking as 
model what happens in the armies of other democratic states." 
  Showing that he was not the supporter of the idea "to copy 
automatically all that is there (in other democratic 
countries)," he considers that "we should apply only what is 
best of their experience, but adjusting it to our own needs." 
  A diplomat of career, Gheorghe Tinca explains why the 
appointment of a ministry of civil defence was necessary and 
goes on to say: "My experience as a diplomat is, in my opinion, 
appropriate for the current stage of reform in the Army. It is, 
in fact, a stress laid on contacts, on interactions between our 
Army and the armies of other countries. This, first of all, as 
regards `the Partnership for Peace' plan, but not exclusively. 
We aim to foster ties not only with armies of the countries in 
the partnership, but also with that in the European countries 
that are not members of that partnership. I would like the 
Romanian Army to build a network of relations that will include 
other countries of the world, starting with major countries such 
as China, Japan, and then with armies in the Latin American 
states and in other countries of the world. This does not 
affect our main target, that is our integration within 
Euro-Atlantic political, economic, and military structures." 
  Referring to the modernisation of the Romanian Army, the 
Romanian defence minister is of the opinion that "due to the 
current situation in our country, that is, a period of 
transition, I think that a priority is that of keeping the Army 
structured to perform a discouraging function, taking into 
consideration the fact that we are in an area of instability 
that threatens to become more unstable. Under these 
circumstances, I think that it would be extremely good for the 
Romanian Army to perform a deterrence function, which means that 
it will be always operational, but maintained as a 
well-determined mechanism to be used whenever needed," the 
Romanian defence minister said. 
  The state of proper training would mean for us and also for 
the area we are living in a function favourable for stability," 
Gheorghe Tinca said.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES 22/3/1994 -- The Senate resumed 
Tuesday, March 22, the debates of the bill on war veterans and 
widows. The parliamentary group of the Hungarian Democratic 
Union of Romania, UDMR, asked for permission to make a political 
declaration on part of the articles of the said bill. Submitted 
to vote, the request was rejected. Consequently the members of 
the UDMR parliamentary group walked out of the Senate Hall. 
  The Senate passed in its Monday, March 21 sitting an 
amendment to an article of the bill on war veterans and widows 
saying that the residents of Romanian territories occupied over 
1940-1945, that were called to arms fight in the Armies of other 
states are considered to be war veterans only "if they did not 
fight against the Romanian Army." The members of the UDMR group 
opposed the amendment.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 22/3/1994 -- A main railway with 
higher speed and European gauges on the Iasi (Romania)-Chisinau 
(Republic of Moldova) route will be built with financial support 
given by Romania's Government, told daily VOCEA ROMANIEI Teodor 
Groza, secretary of state, head of the railway department. The 
funding, worth 95 million lei, including 70 million lei for the 
drawing up of technical studies on the integration of the 
Ungheni (customs point)-Chisinau railway in the European 
transportation network, and 25 million lei for the technical 
surveys on the rebuilding of an important railway section in the 
Republic of Moldova, were earmarked under a Romanian Government 
resolution out of the fund placed at the Romanian Government's 
disposal for the relations with the Republic of Moldova for 
1993. The state secretary said that experts of the railway 
transportation ministries of the two states held several 
meetings to discuss "the integration of the railway 
transportation of the Republic of Moldova in the European 
transportation." 
  Teodor Groza said in the interview that the Romanian party 
offered the railways of the Republic of Moldova the possibility 
of having the equipment repaired in workshops in Romania. As a 
member of the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Romania's 
Relations with the Republic of Moldova, Teodor Groza said that 
the Romanian party gave Moldova assistance in the working out of 
technical surveys on railways, tariff policy, and training of 
personnel. 
  As for road transportation, he said, Romania's Government 
will give financial support for the repair of the bridge across 
the Prut River at Radauti-Lipcani, and is seeking technical 
solutions for the building of a road bridge at Ungheni.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 22 (CTK) -- Julius Binder, 
director of the construction company which built the 
controversial Gabcikovo dam on the Danube, told Slovak Radio 
today he did not rule out that the accidents at the gates of 
Gabcikovo's two locks were the result of sabotage. 
  A part of the left lock's bottom gate was torn on Sunday [20 
March] night due to a so far unknown reason. The resultant wave 
under the dam damaged mechanisms on the bottom gate of the right 
lock, which has been blocked by the wrecked Ukrainian boat 
Zernograd. International ship transport in this section of the 
Danube has been interrupted. It is expected to be resumed by 
the end of the week. 
  "The commission in charge of finding the cause of the damage 
has not yet disclosed its conclusions. Accident is 
inconceivable, and intentional damage cannot be ruled out," 
Binder said. "Everyday efforts to block the success of the dam 
are evident," he added. 
  He pointed out that the locks' gates have been operating for 
a year, and before the wreckage of Zernograd on February 11 they 
were to undergo modification to eliminate problems. Binder 
stressed that any defect in the gates was unlikely. 
  Binder said that neither the accidents nor the spring thaw 
posed a threat to the residents of the surrounding area. There 
is a reserve to divert surplus water, he explained. 
  "It is strange that since the beginning the left lock and 
the 
Gabcikovo dam as a whole have been accompanied by many hazards," 
Binder said. He referred to the theft of electronic regulating 
devices at the left lock, the tearing off of control cameras by 
a lorry, irresponsibility of the crew of Zernograd and the slow 
pace of its removal, and the unnatural substances found in wells 
destined for the examination of underground water. "Enemies of 
the dam exist here and are working intensively," Binder 
emphasizes. 
  He said that the repair of the locks will not cost much, 
only 
millions, not tens of millions of crowns. "However, the problem 
lies in the moral damage, in negativistic tendencies which will 
emerge throughout the world," he pointed out.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 22 (CTK) -- The popularity of 
deposed premier Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS) is once again on the rise, Slovak Radio reported 
today. 
  Citing its own poll conducted March 11-16, immediately after 
Meciar's fall from power, the station said that if parliamentary 
elections were held today, 26 per cent of voters would vote 
HZDS. The Democratic Left Party (SDL) would trail with only 11 
percent, the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) with 6 percent, 
and the Association of Workers (SD), which recently split from 
the SDL, with five percent. Fifteen percent of voters were 
undecided for any party and 11 per cent said they would not vote.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 22 (CTK) -- "We expected this 
given the wave of emotions," Chairman of the coalition 
Democratic Left Party (SDL) Peter Weiss commented on the 
increased popularity of former Premier Vladimir Meciar today. 
  Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) rating 
increased from 18 to about 26 per cent after the fall of his 
government in mid-March. The SDL, for its part, would be 
supported by only 10 per cent of Slovaks. 
  "We must convince citizens that it is possible to rule 
without threats, scandals and creating the image of an enemy, 
and by means of cooperation and reasonable compromises. I am 
not pessimistic at all," said Weiss. 
  Moreover, the government has prepared some pragmatic steps, 
including launching the second wave of coupon privatization 
shortly before elections, he added. The elections are slated 
for September 31-October 1. 
  "Even a citizen who does not have enough money to 
participate 
in privatization, should be given a chance," stressed Weiss, 
specifying that the coupon method (most important privatization 
method in the Czech Republic), virtually abandoned in Slovakia 
in 1992, will be just one of several ways of privatization. 
  "Meciar is expected to receive some 22 to 25 percent (in the 
elections). But it is too little to form a government and I do 
not know anyone willing to create a coalition with him," Milan 
Knazko, chairman of the governing Alliance of Slovak Democrats 
(AD SR), said.

[German marks] for the construction of buildings and houses for 
Serbian settlers envisaged to be brought to Kosova. 
  [number indistinct] Albanians have been suspended so far 
from 
their jobs and are being replaced by Serbians [word indistinct] 
in Kosova from Serbia, Bosnia, or Croatia. 300,000 Albanians 
have immigrated during the recent years and forced by the 
Serbian repression they have emigrated in Western Europe. There 
are so far 30,000 Serbian settlers in Kosova and this number is 
increasing. New settlers, who keep coming to Kosova, have been 
given houses and agricultural land. 
  The Kosova colonization is laid as primary task in the 
Milosevic nationalist program for an unique Serbia. Last week, 
Serbian authorities in Prishtina decided to grant Serbians 50 
construction sites.

  [Text] Tirana, March 22 (ATA) -- The UN High Commissariat 
for Refugees (UNHCR) held on March 18 a meeting devoted to 
Kosova and Albanian refugees. Fifty jurists of the commissariat 
and two members of the DLK [Kosova Democratic Alliance] 
Presidency, the Benelux branch, Ramadan Gashi and Gani Azemi 
took part in the meeting. 
  The DLK representatives pointed out that due to the terror 
and continuous violence in Kosova, many Albanian youngsters are 
forced to leave their country and seek temporary asylum in the 
Western states. Moreover they are under the Serbian threat for 
violently being called up in the Serbian Army and then sent to 
Bosnia and Croatia. 
  Referring to this campaign, Mr. Gashi and Mr. Azemi said 
that 
"the Albanian people in Kosova are under a permanent threat,

<F P=106> [Article by Sorin Rosca-Stanescu: "The Interior Ministry's </F>
Hot News"] 
  [Text] A shocking element has emerged in the scandal of 
the generals: We finally have proof of the existence in 
Romania, beginning 26 March 1993, of an official (but illegal) 
and particularly well-organized surveillance network for 
political purposes of party and trade union leaders, public 
figures, journalists, foreign citizens, and Romanians traveling 
abroad, aimed at monitoring and reporting daily on the mood of 
the population and infiltrating the Diaspora. 
  The entire system characteristic of the political police has 
been organized by the UM 0215 -- the secret service of the 
Ministry of Interior [MI]. Under the leadership of the former 
interior minister, George Ion Danescu, and his close aide, 
General Dan Gheorghe, a few days ago still the chief of the UM 
0215 Secret Service, a comprehensive and extremely precise work 
method was drafted, which is compulsory for all regional 
intelligence services. This method, which we possess, 
constitutes an indubitable proof that top officials in the 
Ministry of Interior have initiated the most flagrant violation 
of the Constitution and the country's laws, thus seriously 
jeopardizing our citizens' freedom. We want to specify that all 
information obtained from this extensive network of agents is 
entered on a daily basis in the computer of the Romanian 
Intelligence Service [SRI]. Then this information is used for 
political purposes. Thus, SRI is doing its dirty work with the 
help of the secret service of the Ministry of Interior. The 
astonishing thing is that a parliamentary commission (which 
checked unit 0215 some two months ago) discovered a number of 
irregularities, but failed to discover the essential thing. The 
secret of this monster within the Ministry of Interior has been 
carefully preserved so far. 
  The espionage affair in which Lieutenant General Marin 
Pancea, counselor to President Ion iliescu and secretary of the 
country's Defense Council, was allegedly involved and the 
dismissals of Major General Gh. Diaconescu, chief of the SRI 
Espionage Department, and of General Dan Gheorghe, chief of the 
UM-0215 within the Ministry of Interior, as well as the 
espionage affair made public by Traian Basescu, at the end of 
which is General Grylakis [involved in Romanian fleet sale 
scandal], seem to be linked by certain threads but also through 
mysterious rivalries at the top executive level. 
  Until the situation as a whole is clarified, we will reveal 
to the public the following details about the most serious 
political espionage case after 1989. If an earthquake will be 
triggered in the Ministry of Interior and the SRI, and in 
Romanian society on the whole, ending with the main protagonists 
on the accusation bench, then this means that Romania still has 
a chance to improve. 
<H5>  Secret Work Method </H5>
  Here are the things with which the Intelligence Department 
of 
the Ministry of Interior -- UM-0215 -- dealt beginning 26 March 
1993 (when Circular No. 00608801 was officially and secretly 
disseminated). We will now summarize some of the compulsory 
objectives pursued by the agents at home and abroad: 
  "1. Actions against national security; 2. Nationalist, 
irredentist, separatist, and racial actions; 3. Actions 
regarding the physical life and security of Romanian and foreign 
citizens whose security falls within the competence of the 
Ministry of Interior (so far nothing abnormal, the above 
activities being legal); 4. Specific information about 
antiterrorist actions (a strange activity because there is a 
specialized antiterrorist unit attached to the SRI, while, 
through the nature of things, the Watch and Protection Service 
(SPP) performs such activities); 5. Foreign citizens' actions; 
6. Romanian citizens actions (and in this connection we will 
reproduce and specify certain aspects of the secret work method 
clearly revealing what 0215 actually pursued: `F. 63 -- 
attitudes, positions, assessments; F. 38 -- went abroad for 
specialization; F. 39 -- studied abroad; F. 40 -- went abroad 
for specialized assistance.'" Above I have outlined certain 
typical activities of the political police. And now further 
details). 7. Specific essentials regarding state and 
professional interests; 8. Specific essentials of the activity 
of information protection; 9. Essentials regarding antecedents; 
10. Specific essentials regarding operative information about 
Romanians abroad. (And again some information about the method 
regarding these "essentials": "F. 12 -- employed at foreign 
missions or foreign branches in Romania; F. 81 -- temporarily 
resident abroad; F. 101 -- possession of funds; F. 107 -- people 
holding dual citizenship.") 
  We hope that our readers realize how extensive and dangerous 
this network is, which has been set up under the guidance of the 
generals from the secret unit of the Ministry of Interior. 
Circular No. 00608801 is signed by deputy directors -- Colonel 
Marica, Colonel Condoiu, and Colonel Stan. 
  We also want to specify that following dispositions issued 
for all regional units in a secret radiogram in May 1993, the 
information obtained by this network is no longer passed on to 
regional chiefs, but is necessarily entered in the SRI computer. 
We doubt that the opposition parties have access to the data 
obtained in this way. Sealing the mechanism whereby the 
Ministry of Interior is gradually being subordinated to the SRI, 
a decision was made whereby no one can be employed in the 
Ministry of Interior, without the agreement of the institution 
headed by Virgil Magureanu. 
  We are waiting for the reaction of parliamentarians.

<F P=106> [Article by Sorin Rosca-Stanescu: "UM 0215 -- What It Is </F>
and What Its Business Is -- The Founder: Gelu Voican Voiculescu"] 
  [Text] After the arrest of General Iulian Vlad, head of 
the Department of State Security, and Generals Geanu Bucurescu, 
Aristotel Stamatoiu, and Vasile Gheorghe on 31 December 1989, 
Gelu Voican Voiculescu was appointed commander of the 
Directorate of State Security. Beginning 2 January 1990, 
General Nicolae Militaru, [then] minister of national defense, 
and Gelu Voican led the takeover of the Securitate structures by 
the Ministry of National Defense. They elaborated a draft 
decree stipulating the establishment of the National Security 
Council [Consiliul Sigurantei Statului], but Ion Iliescu refused 
to sign it. Nicolae Militaru ordered the 566 officers working 
for the Bucharest Municipality Securitate and the majority of 
the officers of the former 4th Directorate for Military 
Counterespionage to be transferred to reserve duty. During the 
month of January [1990] Gelu Voican obtained the assent of the 
Provisional Government and Ion Iliescu to utilize the officers 
of the former Bucharest Municipality Securitate to set up a 
special directorate of the Ministry of Interior, which was done 
in maximum secrecy. They named that directorate UM [Military 
Unit] 0215. Its first commander was Admiral Cico Dumitrescu. 
However, the person that actually had command over the unit was 
Gelu Voican Voiculescu, who was also deputy prime minister. His 
first counselor was reserve General Nicolae Voican. One of his 
closest aides was Viorel Tache, formerly subordinate to General 
Doicaru at UM 0920, later officer of the "Inimical Writings" 
[Inscrisuri Dusmanoase] Bureau of the Bucharest Municipality 
Securitate, and currently owner of the Georgiana Ltd [company]. 
Later on the command [of UM 0215] was taken over successively 
by counterespionage Colonels Florin Calapod, Cristescu, and 
Harosa. An ample report that was broadcast on 11 February 
[1990] by Radio Free Europe revealed that during the time when 
Mihai Chitac was [interior] minister, the officers and 
noncommissioned officers of UM 0215 owned a number of false 
identification cards, each using various names, in the same way 
the Greek General Grylakis [involved in the Petromin scandal in 
Romania] and his men do, all of whom currently are under penal 
investigations in Athens. Following the 20 May 1990 general 
elections, UM 0215 was involved in every dirty affair: in the 
printing and circulating of the so-called Iron Guard fliers in 
Bacau and Bucharest, and the fabrication of false documents 
intended to discredit Corneliu Coposu, Radu Campeanu, and Marian 
Munteanu [opposition personalities]. On 18 February 1990 they 
staged the mob's forcing its way into the government 
headquarters, later on they acted to discredit the marathon 
rally in University Square, and in June 1990 they directed the 
moves of the miners in Bucharest. The Radio Free Europe report 
also mentions the fact that over that period of time the main 
opposition parties and the persons close to the significant 
opposition leaders were penetrated by officers of that unit. On 
14 June 1990, Colonel Ion Nicolae and First Sergeant Corneliu 
Dumitrescu of UM 0215 supervised the stealing of documents and 
valuables from the home of [opposition leader] Ion Ratiu. 
Following the appointment of Doru Viorel Ursu as [interior] 
minister, they ceased to use false identification cards and 
manifold identities. The leadership of the unit was replaced by 
appointing Colonel Jenica Iosif as its commander and Colonel Ion 
Condoiu as deputy commander. That is when the rivalry began 
between UM 0215 and the SRI [Romanian Intelligence Service]. It 
seems that as long as the portfolio of interior was held by Doru 
Viorel Ursu and Victor Babiuc, the actions against the political 
opposition ceased. About 100 officers of the unit were 
transferred to SRI. This was followed by the firing of Colonel 
Ion Rusu. The current official structure of the leadership of 
UM 0215 is as follows: The Counterespionage Division is headed 
by Colonel Gheorghe Stan, former deputy of General Emil Macri; 
the Intelligence Division headed by Colonel Ion Condoiu; the 
aforementioned division consists of three services: The 
Antihooligan Fighting and Protection Service, headed by Colonel 
Dumitru Ionel; the Delinquency and Parasitism Service, headed by 
Colonel Dumitru Constantin; and the Economic Intelligence 
Service, headed by Colonel Ion Mandrila.

<F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "The Nicolae Vacaroiu Style"] </F>
  [Text] Extended over two hours, Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu's news conference did not yield anything new. The 
style is like the man, it seems, not only insofar as his 
handwriting is concerned, but also news conferences. Balzac is 
easy to recognize in his novels and Nicolae Vacaroiu in his news 
conferences. The way he appears in front of journalists betrays 
the style he has adopted in his position of prime minister. 
What could be noted, especially in his answers to the 
questions, was the incoherence characteristic of Nicolae 
Vacaroiu's activity as prime minister. To listen to a Nicolae 
Vacaroiu speech is a hard task for an intelligent person who is 
used to thinking on the basis of Aristotelian logic. Vacaroiu 
has the talent to contradict himself without batting an eyelid. 
Here is an example. The whole exercise on Monday, 14 March, was 
designed to present himself as a genuine reformist. At one 
point, however, he made an affirmation that clearly contradicted 
this: "Thus, as long as I hold this position, the economy has to 
function, come out of the crisis, and proceed to the 
restructuring and privatization process..." Thus Romania's 
prime minister views the period of his governance divided into 
two stages: First, he takes the economy out of the crisis, 
makes it function, and second, he restructures and privatizes 
it. As is known, the two elements of the reform -- 
privatization and restructuring -- have been thought out by 
economists of greater caliber than Nicolae Vacaroiu and not as a 
purpose in itself, but as a means to take the economy out of the 
crisis caused by the centralized communist system. And this for 
a simple reason: Only privatization and restructuring -- 
typical elements of market relations -- may make the economy 
function within maximum parameters! Communism collapsed 
precisely because it failed at the economic level. The Romanian 
prime minister, however, thinks that we may make the economy 
function before privatization and restructuring. What is to be 
understood from this? That Nicolae Vacaroiu continues to 
believe in the efficiency of communist means at the economic 
level. Thus he betrays his centralist thinking. Without wanting 
to, he also betrays that he is a convinced antireformist. Thus 
he declared in front of the entire press and, through it, in 
front of the entire nation, that the means used by his 
government so far have been those of communist centralism. 
Understandably, this is harshly at variance with his emphasis 
throughout the news conference of being a convinced reformist. 
The incoherence typical of the Nicolae Vacaroiu government was 
also obvious during the news conference in the prime minister's 
talent to jump several times from one subject to another within 
the same sentence. He begins, for example, by referring to the 
machine-building industry only to find himself talking how to 
cultivate field flowers at the end of the sentence. The same 
news conference revealed another trait of the political style 
practiced by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. This is what one 
could call aggressive bragging. Normally, braggarts earn 
sympathy. Nicolae Vacaroiu, however, is a braggart who gets on 
your nerves. When he says that the decline in material 
production has stopped, that the GNP and labor productivity per 
employee have increased, and that exports have considerably 
grown, Nicolae Vacaroiu simply does not brag. Actually, he 
polemizes with all those who hold that things are not going 
well. That is so with all Romanians. Had this been Stalin's 
time, Nicolae Vacaroiu would have sent everyone who did not 
utter praise of the way he governs to jail. Living in a 
democracy, he has to be content to brag. The aggressiveness 
behind his bragging betrays how he suffers that it is not 
Stalin's time. At first sight, Nicolae Vacaroiu seems a modest 
man minding his own business. If you study him closely, you will 
find that he is a man who has an unusually positive opinion 
about himself. The tone of both his introductory statement and 
his answers during the news conference was characterized by an 
irritating arrogance. On the basis of the fact that he is the 
prime minister, Nicolae Vacaroiu has decided that he is 
unquestionably superior to absolutely everything that moves in 
this country, especially since he believes that everything that 
moves stands on one side exchanging opinions, while he, Nicolae 
Vacaroiu, is working hard to govern the country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oliviu Gherman, president of the Senate and </F>
the Social Democracy Party of Romania, PDSR, by Ileana Lucaciu; 
place and date not given: "Stupidity Means To Be Frozen in 
Blueprints"] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  There Is No Contradiction Between Monarchy and 
Progress or Between Republic and Progress </H3>
  [Lucaciu] I know from very reliable sources that you are a 
passionate and very good bridge player. When do you find the 
time to indulge in your hobby? 
  [Gherman] Unfortunately, I do not have too much time for it. 
After all these things quiet down -- which make each week seem 
like the week in which the world was created, since we have so 
much to do each week that when we reach the seventh day we no 
longer feel like resting any more -- that is, after we finish 
with these weekly remakes of the initial week of the world 
creation, I will find some time for bridge. 
  [Lucaciu] Do you think that this race against the clock will 
ever end? 
  [Gherman] It is not fully up to me to ensure that we reach 
such a normal working week; to a large extent, it is up to the 
wisdom of the political forces in Romania. 
  [Lucaciu] Your duties as Senate president have made you 
travel abroad quite a lot. If you were ever to return to those 
places as a simple tourist, which country would you choose? 
  [Gherman] First of all, I would like to specify that my 
function makes me do some traveling abroad, but not quite a lot, 
as you said. All these duties at the head of various 
delegations have meant that, with very few exceptions, I saw 
almost nothing of the countries I visited. If the schedule for 
the delegation members is somewhat more flexible and allows them 
to also tour a given city, my program is usually so heavy that I 
can hardly see anything of it at all. Let me give you an 
example. I attended a NATO meeting in Denmark and I did not 
even find the time to go out into Copenhagen's streets even 
once. If I were to return to one of these countries, I think I 
would choose one of the two Asian countries I visited, and not 
because they happen to be among the ones I visited recently. I 
would choose Japan because it managed to achieve a formidable 
blend of historical tradition and the people's spirit of 
sacrifice and devotion to work. I would also go back to India, 
the country I fell in love with when I was invited there in the 
70's to give some lectures in physics at three or four 
university centers. India has instilled in me a certain 
philosophy of peace and nonaggression. 
  [Lucaciu] You have recently returned from Japan, where you 
had the honor of being received by Japan's emperor. At this 
point in history, Japan is one of the important economic forces 
of the world. It is an overdeveloped country headed by a 
traditional monarchy. How do you see the relationship between 
the monarchy and Japan's development? 
  [Gherman] There is no contradiction between the monarchy and 
the development of that country. Japan has built its political 
balance around the Imperial Court and around the structures that 
have led to the existence of the Imperial Court. I visited 
several homes of shoguns from the last century. There was a 
prevalent cult of power and of the master, and this has reached 
extraordinary dimensions in Japan. In 1868, the powers that be 
came up with the current solution of an imperial family, which 
took over the country's leadership, with all the shoguns 
accepting that solution. The life of the Japanese society, which 
first developed around the courts of the shoguns and later 
around the Imperial Court, has created a most respectable 
tradition. You must realize that there is no contradiction 
between monarchy and progress, as there is no contradiction 
between the republic and progress. They are accepted forms in 
various countries. One cannot say that the Nordic countries, 
which are all monarchies, are economically backward. That would 
be a formidable gaffe. I do not believe that a certain form of 
government, be it monarchy or republic, could be the key to 
success per se. It is more a matter of choice by the respective 
society and none of the aforementioned models of government can 
open the gates of paradise by themselves. 
<H5>  Politics Are Being Played by Ear </H5>
  [Lucaciu] I know that you are a great lover of classic 
music. Could you make an analogy between our political life and 
a famous musical score? 
  [Gherman] Paradoxically, I would compare our political life 
to Bartok's orchestra concerto. There is a great sound 
potential, both in our life and in Bartok's music. Bartok 
managed to produce complete order in his music, although a 
superficial listening to his concerto might not reveal this 
complete order. There is a sensation of musical cacophony 
there, but if you listen carefully, you realize it is an 
extraordinary score. If you look at the political effervescence 
of our society, everything seems to be a political cacophony. 
However, I believe that there is a basic substance there which, 
if one watches carefully, can be discovered in our social and 
political life. However, we will have to create some order in 
our own backyard. 
  [Lucaciu] You mention the need for order. It does not seem 
to exist in many parties. Let us take for example the liberal 
movement, which is almost entirely crippled. 
  [Gherman] The liberal movement in Romania -- just as the 
other political orientations in our country -- is substantially 
influenced by the people that head it. The liberal movement 
only stands to gain a lot if the egos of the various figures 
belonging to the movement's subdivisions are put in the service 
of the movement. Our country needs a liberal movement. I have 
talked to older and more recent liberals and I can tell you that 
the distance between the older approach and the neoliberal 
concept is as from heaven to earth. They will have to clarify 
and substantiate their neoliberal arguments and solutions, 
because, right now, politics is being too much played by ear. 
But this applies not only to the liberals, it also applies to 
other parties, as well. 
  [Lucaciu] You are heading a social-democratic party. In its 
turn, the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)] 
also considers itself to be a social-democratic party. Then, 
there is also Sergiu Cunescu's Social Democratic Party [PSDR]. 
Therefore, it is not only the liberal trend that has several 
directions, but also the social-democratic one. Do you see the 
likelihood of a unification of the social-democratic movement? 
  [Gherman] Not only that it is possible, but, over the medium 
term, that it is also an obligation of the social-democratic 
movement in Romania. One will have to establish the landmarks 
of social democracy, regardless of the figures that currently 
dominate the various social-democratic groupings. I believe 
that not enough has been done to clarify the content of the 
social-democratic concept. To this, one should add the 
confrontation of egos, which is quite apparent both in the case 
of the social democracy and in the case of the liberal movement, 
something which hampers the movement's natural regrouping. It 
is like a typical childhood illness at the beginning of 
Romania's political life. Within a reasonable period of two, 
three, or four years, we will eventually reach a balance in our 
political life with its basic components: neoliberalism, 
Christian democracy, and social democracy. 
  [Lucaciu] You are a politician of vast parliamentary 
experience. In your capacity as president of the Senate, you 
often have to quell your colleagues' outbursts of temper. In 
your opinion, how can one avoid such outbursts in the future, as 
they occasionally cast an unfavorable light upon our 
parliamentary life as a whole? 
  [Gherman] I would like to remind you that in 1926-1927, a 
great statesman who made an enormous contribution to Turkey's 
progress, namely Ataturk [Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern 
Turkey], was confronted by one of the ministers during a cabinet 
session he attended. Ataturk took out a pistol and shot the 
minister. In general, I do not carry guns and I do not plan to 
shoot anyone. To answer your question, I will cite to you a 
Japanese joke. Two students, one Japanese and one French, were 
sharing the same room in a students' hostel. Each day the 
French student used to punch the Japanese one, who did not reply 
at all. After a year, the French guy told the Japanese that he 
has had enough of hitting him without riposte. At which, the 
Japanese told him that was a wise decision, since he himself had 
gotten fed up spitting into the French student's tea.... 
<H5>  I Do Not Consider Myself President of the Party </H5>
  [Lucaciu] You are the president of the ruling party. 
However, many analysts claim that the true president of the 
PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] is Mr. Ion Iliescu, who 
is allegedly making the important decisions in your party. 
  [Gherman] The analysts are right, but only half way. They 
are right to the extent that I do not consider myself the 
party's president and that President Ion Iliescu has been our 
party's polarization factor. In this respect, they are right. 
However, as far as the taking of decisions is concerned, they 
are totally wrong there. President Iliescu -- regardless of the 
way or the light in which some people want to present him -- has 
a certain kind of delicacy and does not want to impose his 
viewpoints, not even in political matters. We often consult 
each other, out of a sense of being colleagues in our civic 
duties. It will soon be two years since I began -- 
unfortunately for myself -- to fulfill this task as PDSR 
president and I have never had the feeling that President 
Iliescu was imposing a certain viewpoint upon me. Usually, 
during the discussions we have, we reach a viewpoint that is the 
result of arguments and not of pressures coming from either 
side. Therefore, regarding your question and the assessments of 
political analysts, I can say that the truth is somewhere in the 
middle. 
  [Lucaciu] As your colleague Alexandru Popovici [senator of 
the Civic Alliance Party, PAC] very well expressed it, the 
recent governmental reshuffle was done in a conspiratorial 
manner. You were in the middle of negotiations with other 
parties when you brusquely proceeded to change four ministers. 
Will this reshuffle not affect the further negotiations with 
the opposition and the parties of the governmental coalition? 
  [Gherman] I would like to tell you that all reshuffles come 
rather brusquely in any society with a serious political life. 
Reshuffles that are announced with much ado weeks in advance do 
nothing but harm the political life. I must tell you a little 
secret. We are deliberately introducing viruses, that is, 
misleading information. 
  [Lucaciu] We call them intoxications. 
  [Gherman] We are causing such intoxications of the mass 
media so that we can be left alone to thoroughly examine the 
situation in peace. I believe that -- if the political forces 
with which we are engaged in talks take a dispassionate look at 
the reshuffle and think of the country's future -- the reshuffle 
should not only fail to negatively affect the negotiations, but 
on the contrary, it will become an argument in the hands of our 
partners in the future talks. If you read the press of recent 
years, you will note that it has insistently demanded the 
replacement of the ministers of defense and interior with 
civilians. Now that we have done just that, we are being 
accused for having done it! If you read the newspapers of 
April-June 1993, you will see with what satisfaction the papers 
wrote about the failure of the talks with the IMF; when the 
talks ended with the signing of the "Memorandum," the same 
newspapers began finding fault with the "Memorandum" as such. 
There is a kind of journalistic infancy at the level of our 
mass media, too. It does not bother or upset me. Anyhow, 
coming back to the substance of these reshuffles, they should 
not really upset anyone; on the contrary, they should be an 
additional proof of our openness. 
<H5>  The Ministry of Industry Is a Colossus </H5>
  [Lucaciu] The appointment of civilians at the Ministry of 
Defense and Interior is a good chess move on the part of the 
ruling party, since it is in agreement with the requirements of 
the Council of Europe. However, I would like to remind you that 
both the government party and President Ion Iliescu admitted 
that we are going through a period of serious economic crisis. 
Therefore, it seems at least strange that, at a time of 
economic crisis, with its inherent blockages, you are changing 
the ministers of defense, interior, or justice. One would have 
rather expected a change in the sphere of industry or 
agriculture. 
  [Gherman] The timing you are suggesting does not always 
coincide with the timing one can politically accept. Apropos 
the productive spheres, since you were talking about industry 
and agriculture, it is up to the prime minister to replace the 
respective secretaries of state whenever he wants, since this is 
part of his prerogatives. On the other hand, such a change 
cannot be done without planning. I am against frivolous moves 
in the political life. I believe that one should proceed from 
the bottom to the top in the aforementioned areas. This does 
not mean that one cannot operate some changes at the top, too. 
One should first see what can be done to amend the situation 
where irregularities occur. Let us take for instance the 
Ministry of Industry, which is a colossus; it has 14 or 15 
secretaries of state, in charge of various directorates. 
Decentralization could not be achieved here overnight. The 
ministry still suffers from the centralized economic 
coordination of certain industrial sectors. If anyone believes 
that Minister of Industry Dumitru Popescu can be blamed for 
various shortcomings in his ministry, he is wrong. This does 
not mean that there may not be some shortcomings in Dumitru 
Popescu's own activity; if we ever come to the conclusion that 
these shortcomings exceed his merits, then we will replace him 
at the right moment. For the time being, we do not intend to do 
so. Therefore, any attempt by you, no matter how able it is, to 
channel the discussion toward second-guessing our future 
approach to the government's activity is doomed to failure. You 
will not get any information out of me. 
  [Lucaciu] You said that a change does not necessarily mean 
to operate at the top, but rather to go from the bottom to the 
top. The PDSR, which has been in power for almost one and a half 
years, is accused of contributing to the phenomenon of 
restoration, through this concern with consolidating the basis. 
  [Gherman] In this respect, the opposition has been quite 
ingenious in using all the possible pejorative terms it could 
find against the PDSR. We thank it for this lesson, because it 
is also teaching us how to treat it when it has the pleasure of 
coming to power. The metaphors they are using are the most 
authentic proof of a typically dictatorial frame of mind, which 
they themselves criticize in another context. In the communist 
regime, everything was placed in little boxes clearly labeled: 
leftism, opportunism, and so forth. Now we have more 
"ism"-endings than we could ever imagine. It looks like the 
mirror has turned the other way round, toward the opposition. 
We have become used to these invectives and each time we 
discover another one, we nurture a feeling of satisfaction, 
since we are confronted with yet another argument that unmasks 
the users of those metaphors for what they are -- their way of 
thinking is an accusation against themselves. 
  [Lucaciu] Since you have talked about "ism"-endings, you are 
also being accused of centralism. 
  [Gherman] Well, it is incomparably easier to criticize than 
to do something. We are in the unpleasant position of people 
obliged to do something. It is very easy to see everything that 
is wrong or looks like being wrong. As a matter of fact, this 
is why I agreed to become involved in political life. I never 
liked to sit in judgment of others without doing anything. I 
prefer to be judged and cursed. It is a feature of my character. 

<H5>    Everybody Votes as He Deems Fit </H5>
  [Lucaciu] There was much talk about the PDSR being a united 
and monolithic party. However, it has ceased to manifest itself 
as such for some time and speculations are now being made about 
the existence of two trends within the PDSR. For instance, on 
Monday 7 March we were taken by surprise when the former 
minister of justice, Mr. Petre Ninosu, did not obtain the 
necessary vote for his election to the position as vice 
president of the Senate from some of his own party colleagues. 
Mr. Ion Solcanu managed to obtain it, but with difficulty. 
  [Gherman] When you show me a united and monolithic party in 
Romania, then I will start being again afraid of a restoration 
and the revival of dictatorship. As for the incident you 
mentioned, well some people liked one solution, others another 
solution. The only thing they did not think of during the vote 
was that their gesture took place at a time when the people had 
already been taken by surprise by the governmental reshuffle. 
There has not been enough time to let things settle and quiet 
down; otherwise, that incident might have been avoided. From a 
human viewpoint, I am very upset with what happened to Mr. 
Ninosu, as I can well imagine what he must be feeling right now. 
  [Lucaciu] I gave an example that involved people, therefore, 
one could conceivably say that subjective considerations might 
have been at play here. However, one gets the same feeling of 
the existence of various trends within the PDSR when seeing the 
fate of the Law on Radio and Television Societies. After it 
passed through the Senate, it is now bogged down in the Chamber 
of Deputies. The PDSR deputies tried to introduce a lot of 
substantial amendments, after the PDSR senators passed it in a 
certain formula. We are talking here about different and even 
divergent concepts. 
  [Gherman] The law has been worked out by the Senate Culture 
Commission, which did not pay due attention to my observations 
during its discussion in the Senate. Some of these observations 
coincide with the amendments brought now in the Chamber. One 
should also take into consideration the fact that the Senate 
Culture and Mass-Media Commission is headed by Mr. Adrian 
Paunescu [vice president of the Socialist Party of Labor-PSM], 
who is a real volcano. Sometimes you can block a water overflow 
or you can put out a fire. But I have not yet heard of anyone 
managing to contain a volcanic eruption. Therefore, the law 
that has emerged from the Senate bears the imprint of Adrian 
Paunescu, with all its good and bad points. Generally speaking, 
all the cultural laws we promulgated bear his imprint. The rule 
of the game is that man creates history, not the other way 
round. Consequently, we are dealing here with a natural 
evolution within this legislative process. 
  [Lucaciu] I have to insist on another subject, namely the 
Law on Land Leasing. There are divergent opinions on this 
subject within the PDSR. Some party people, particularly the 
senators, favor leasing the land to AGROMECS 
[agricultural-mechanization stations], others, particularly the 
deputies in the Chamber are against this measure. 
  [Gherman] We fully observe a constitutional provision that 
forbids compulsory mandates. We put forth arguments and 
counterarguments, after which everybody votes as he deems fit. 
That famous Article Four of the law is hard to evaluate. It is 
like launching a cosmic missile from a l9th-century cannon. 
Maybe the leasing of some lands by the AGROMECS will prove 
beneficial. If the world were ideal, it would certainly have 
proved beneficial. But the world is not ideal, and here comes 
the doubting. I, for instance, doubt that an AGROMEC that is 
leasing land will resist the temptation to pass part of its 
expenditures onto the poor peasant, who has nobody to apply to 
for machinery but the AGROMEC. Others say that if we do not 
permit the leasing of the land, then the fields will remained 
untilled. Both are right in their way. As the famous rabbi of 
Buhusi said: "You are right and you are right." The political 
decision is not an easy thing and not absolutely univocal. Here 
lies, maybe, the unique appeal of the political life. Time will 
prove who better foresaw the effects of a certain deed. Let me 
give you an example: When the law on the legislative elections 
was discussed in Parliament, I foresaw some effects, which 
eventually proved right. My colleagues did not accept my 
conclusions at the respective time. I said that the 
proportional variant that was accepted can lead to aberrations. 
In a given county or constituency, one may not obtain enough 
votes to obtain a seat as senator, but may obtain two seats, 
through the redistribution of the votes. There are other 
aberrations, too. But they did not accept my arguments. We do 
not give "directives" or "precious recommendations" to our 
colleagues about how to compulsorily vote a certain law. 
  [Lucaciu] The curious thing is that, regardless of the law 
submitted to discussion, the same people are making up the two 
groups. Hence, the conclusion of the analysts that there are 
two trends within the PDSR. 
  [Gherman] But it is only natural that it should be so. I 
can tell you that even I, of today, no longer coincide with the 
I of yesterday, and I hope not to coincide with the I of 
tomorrow. 
  [Lucaciu] But you must remain faithful to a certain belief. 
  [Gherman] If I come to the conclusion that this belief is 
detrimental to society, then I must accept that other beliefs 
are better. Despite the fact that I am not a great admirer of 
Liiceanu's [prominent member of the Civic Alliance] political 
opinions -- actually, the reverse is true -- I would like to 
quote a very good statement of his: "Stupidity means to be 
frozen in blueprints." We must realize that each one of us is 
duty bound to change, if we do not want to be frozen in a 
blueprint." 

<H5>    Early Elections -- A Disastrous Solution </H5>
  [Lucaciu] Apropos freezing, there is much talk about being 
"frozen" in the likely parliamentary blockage. This situation 
should inevitably lead to early elections. 
  [Gherman] I believe that the greatest tragedy for our 
country would be to interrupt the normal process of reform 
already started and enter a period of early elections. Whoever 
does not see this, should remember that he stood for this 
disastrous solution, when disaster strikes. Now, more than ever 
before, we need tranquillity so that all political forces can 
focus on implementing the process of reform. We also need a 
timetable of the reform, as implied by the "Memorandum" [with 
the IMF]. If somebody does not learn from experience, then he 
will have to break his own neck before he learns anything. 
  [Lucaciu] At the Cotroceni [presidential palace] meeting 
between the PDSR and Mr. Ion Iliescu -- a meeting that launched 
the second round of negotiations with the political parties -- 
Mr. Adrian Nastase, your party's executive president, said that 
if these negotiations yield no solutions, then the PDSR will 
call early elections. You were absent from that meeting. 
  [Gherman] We must first try to find all possible solutions! 
We are not against early elections because we are afraid of the 
results our political grouping will obtain. We are afraid of 
the eight to nine months that we will lose from the process of 
the reform, which will cost the country dearly. I am also 
afraid that some people's vote will not be for a political 
solution but rather a negative, protest vote against certain 
failures. Generally speaking, negative votes are detrimental to 
society in the long run. I repeat, we do not fear early 
elections, but we do not wish them, since they will delay the 
reform by eight to nine months. We are not only talking about a 
delay here, but also about a leap backward of Romanian society 
by more than one year. Moreover, it is also possible that the 
extremities of the political landscape will increase their 
numbers. If this is what some people want, then let us go for 
early elections. However, I repeat, they are against the 
country's interest. 
  [Lucaciu] Do you recognize that we have extremes in our 
political spectrum? 
  [Gherman] There are definitely extreme positions, 
particularly individual. From a programmatic viewpoint, I have 
seen so very few coherent programs, that I even got scared. 
Some of them cannot even be labeled. I have heard of a 
colossal program of some party, which I do not even want to 
name, only to ascertain that it was nothing but an enumeration 
of mediocre slogans. There is plenty of noise, but no programs. 
Consequently, the political landscape covers a whole spectrum, 
with individual presences in all zones, but with much fewer 
programmatic presences in some of these zones, except for 
certain programmatic presences that scare me and remind me of 
the horror years of the 40's. 
<H5>  I Have No Spirit of Adventure </H5>
  [Lucaciu] It is usually lawyers who become involved in top 
politics. You are a scientist, a known physicist. How does 
physics go with politics? 
  [Gherman] You touched a sensitive cord here. Maybe my 
answer will be interpreted as a political gaffe, but, believe 
me, I do not consider myself a politician. I only consider 
myself as the owner of a floating bridge, that carries things 
from one bank to the other. Political life in our immediate 
past was totally anomalous. I am referring to the dictatorial 
period. I hope that a normal political life will prevail in our 
country over the medium term. I am only a raftsman, trying to 
transfer the Romanian society, with as little damage as 
possible, from the aberrant zone of the dictatorial past to a 
zone of normalcy. Consequently, I am now a kind of political 
clerk, who regrets that he cannot be a very good, as he would 
hope, physics professor. However, someone had to ensure the 
crossover of the Romanian society to the other bank of the 
river. I never liked to stay on the sidelines with my arms 
crossed. 
  [Lucaciu] Professor, I would like you to answer another 
question from the sphere of physics. What are microwaves? 
  [Gherman] There are all kinds of microwaves. It depends on 
where they are placed. Microwaves in the electromagnet field 
are placed in the extreme zone of mechanical access to 
electromagnetic waves. It is a kind of extreme zone of waves 
produced by normal oscillating circuits. Consequently, the zone 
of electromagnetic waves is pushed up to the remote infrared 
optical range. I would say that the microwaves are 
electromagnetic waves that are accessible through special means 
of production, not through the traditional oscillating circuits. 
  [Lucaciu] Please, stop this scientific explanation. I was 
never any good at physics. Actually, I wanted you to tell me 
whether these microwave devices are good in the kitchen. I am 
referring to microwave ovens, which, even though they are not 
"accessible" to us -- because of their stiff price -- have 
conquered the world. 
  [Gherman] They are very good for heating up food without 
altering its vitamin content. 
  [Lucaciu] Are there any similarities in politics with the 
microwave phenomenon? 
  [Gherman] You cannot find similarities there. Politics is a 
step by step phenomenon. To find something similar to 
microwaves in politics, there must be a political continuum 
there. But then, there is no such thing as a political 
continuum, since only undulating phenomena are typical of such a 
continuum. One can talk about a hypothetical kind of 
communication, through suggestion or extrasensory means, in 
politics. Some believe in that, some do not. That is a sphere 
of adventure, and I have no spirit of adventure whatsoever.

  [Text] At Senate headquarters today a delegation from 
Germany's Defense Ministry led by State Secretary for Defense 
Bernd Wilz was received by the chairmen of the defense councils 
of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, Radu Timofte and 
Petre Roman. 
  After briefly presenting the bills that have been already 
passed or that are still to be passed by parliament in the 
domain of defense, public order, and national security, Timofte 
and Roman emphasized the importance of Romania's military 
cooperation with NATO structures, each NATO country, and 
especially Germany. As a sign of the democratization of our 
country's defense structures, Timofte outlined the setting up of 
the National Defense Collegium. 
  The head of the German military delegation stressed the 
interest of his country in a good military cooperation with 
Romania, mentioning within that context that over the current 
year about 40 various cooperation projects are to be 
accomplished, four Romanian officers are currently studying in 
Germany, and that the [word indistinct] of the National Defense 
Ministry, as well as the needs of the Romanian Armed Forces will 
be satisfied to a great extent from the equipment of the army of 
the former German Democratic Republic. 
  In conclusion Wilz appreciated the fact that Romania is on 
the right track regarding the parliament's control over the 
defense, public order, and national security institutions. He 
added that on Wednesday [23 March] a delegation of the Bundestag 
Defense Commission is to arrive in Romania, reports our 
correspondent Dan Preda.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu has received 
Bernd Wilz, parliamentary state secretary in charge of defense 
in the Bundestag, accompanied by Klaus Franke, chairman of the 
German-Romanian Friendship Parliamentary Group. 
  In their discussion the two sides focused on continuing the 
political dialogue at various levels and on relations between 
the two armies. They also examined ways and means to put the 
Partnership for Peace plan into practice, as well as a number of 
international issues, including the situation in former 
Yugoslavia and in the Russian Federation. 
  The two sides also discussed the visits a number of German 
figures will pay to Romania this year: Minister of Defense 
Volker Ruehe, whose visit is scheduled to take place at the 
beginning of April; Foreign Minister Affairs Klaus Kinkel; 
Carl-Dieter Spranger, federal minister of economic cooperation; 
and Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth. 
  Romania's relations with Germany are of particular 
importance 
within the context in which Germany is broaching relations with 
the states in the (?Balkan) area pragmatically and 
indiscriminately, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Mircea Geoana, to our reporter Eugen Baboi at the end 
of the talks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of </F>
Young Democrats, by Attila Gy. Fekete; place and date not given: 
"Banana, Orange, and Tie -- Viktor Orban on the Fidesz's 
Chances"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Fekete] In spite of the 
cooperation agreement between the parties of the liberal bloc, 
serious tensions are straining relations between these parties. 
Some people believe to know that the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ] has given up on the Federation of Young Democrats 
[Fidesz] as an ally and it is opening toward the Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP] that appears to have more chance at the 
elections. According to some politicians, the two biggest 
liberal parties are now only trying to find an excuse to 
terminate the liberal bloc's agreement. 
  [Orban] We will never have perfect tranquillity in the 
liberal bloc, after all, we are also rivals of each other at the 
elections. The question is whether the parties' chairmen will 
have enough wisdom and strength to convince their membership 
about the significance and importance of the cooperation. If 
the parties' chairmen do not find the right proportion between 
competition and cooperation then the liberal bloc might fall 
apart. In my view, similar debates and tensions exist between 
the conservative parties, and they will probably also happen in 
the left-wing bloc. 
  As for the other half of the question, namely that the SZDSZ 
has "given up" the Fidesz and is seeking cooperation with the 
Socialists, I do not believe this. For the SZDSZ, a break with 
the SZDSZ and cooperation with the MSZP at the same time would 
result in a party split. Considering the SZDSZ's membership in 
the provinces, this would lead to the party's disintegration. 
This is not in the interest of either the Fidesz or the SZDSZ. 
  [Fekete] Although the party leaders do not like to enter 
into coalition speculations, the voters are interested in which 
parties would be willing to govern together. At the same time, 
your statements indicate that, apart from the parties of the 
liberal bloc, namely the SZDSZ, the Agrarian Federation, and the 
Entrepreneurs Party, the Fidesz does not have any other possible 
coalition partners. 
  [Orban] A strange situation has arisen because almost all 
parties -- including the MSZP and the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF] -- claim that the Fidesz is a possible coalition partner 
for them while we emphasize our distance from both these 
parties. With the approach of the elections, it is unwise to 
enter into coalition speculations, but I believe that we can and 
must talk about moral dilemmas. It is obvious that a 
significant number of the electors want to replace the current 
coalition. In view of this, the thought that we would still 
have to work together with one or other party of the current 
coalition after the elections can expect to meet with serious 
resistance within our party and among the electors, too. On the 
other hand, our membership would resist it just as much if we 
had to cooperate and work together with those who are the legal 
successors of the party that is responsible for the economic 
destruction of the country. When we know the final results of 
the elections, if this question is still valid then, we will 
convene the Fidesz's appropriate decision-making bodies, the 
national committee or the congress, and we will discuss the 
future. One thing is certain: The Fidesz cannot participate in 
a coalition in which it cannot implement the most important 
elements of its program. On the other hand, all politicians 
have delicate points. On 16 June 1989, at the burial of Imre 
Nagy, I made a speech and I cannot deviate from the spirit of 
this, whether I am thinking about the Fidesz's coalition 
possibilities or my own role. 
  [Fekete] Does this mean that you exclude the possibility of 
a Fidesz-MSZP coalition or that you personally would not 
participate in this government? 
  [Orban] I have formulated principles. The consequences of 
these in a given situation will be made public when we are 
facing this given situation. 
  [Fekete] Do you have similar commitments as regards 
cooperation with the MDF? During the blockade of the taxi 
drivers, you publicly called the government a liar. 
  [Orban] The speech I have mentioned before was about the 
future, rather than on relations with the MDF, the MSZP, or any 
other party. 
  [Fekete] Earlier, the Fidesz indicated that, from the 
Fidesz's point of view, the assessment of the MSZP partly 
depends on whether Sandor Nagy [chairman of the National 
Federation of Trade Unions in Hungary] or Laszlo Bekesi 
[economic expert] is higher up on their national list. However, 
according to economic observers, the Fidesz's economic policy, 
the half turn, is closer to Sandor Nagy's views than to 
Bekesi's.... 
  [Orban] The Fidesz's program lays the main emphasis on 
economic growth, therefore, it is a program that creates 
workplaces. On this point, Nagy's goals certainly coincide with 
those of the Fidesz. Therefore, we would have a good chance to 
coordinate our goals with the trade unions. However, we have 
significant differences on how this goal can be achieved. As 
early as 1990, the Fidesz suggested that the parliamentary 
parties and the interest groups of the employers and employees 
should sit down at a negotiating table and agree on the rules to 
be followed during the period of economic transition. We have 
not given up this idea and, if we are given the opportunity to 
govern after the elections, we intend to make a Hungarian 
Moncloa pact. Without this, and without cooperation with the 
trade unions, it would be much more difficult to put the 
Hungarian economy on a growth course.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of Free </F>
Democrats, by Dezso Pinter; place and date not given: "We Are 
Speaking to Those Who Are Expecting Deeds"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Pinter] Have the Hungarian 
political front lines become final in recent weeks? Are these 
front lines also dividing the liberals? 
  [Peto] These lines are borders increasingly dividing parties 
and groups of parties, and not trenches. The government 
coalition, namely the national conservative camp, is united even 
though, clearly in view of the election campaign, the Christian 
Democratic People's Party [KDNP] is trying to distance itself 
from the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] but it is quite 
cautious in this endeavor: one step forward and one step back. 
However, these two parties will nevertheless take voters away 
from each other. On the other side, we find the Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP] in a nonparty cooperation with the 
National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions [MSZOSZ], while 
the group of liberal parties is a separate camp. Although the 
SZDSZ and the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] have 
similar positions on basic issues, the liberal parties are also 
rivals in the elections. We have always started from the 
premise that an SZDSZ-Fidesz cooperation is in our mutual 
interest. The SZDSZ thinks that the positions would be weakened 
if the two liberal parties sought possible coalition parties 
separately or if the SZDSZ and the Fidesz were not in the same 
government or opposition camp after the elections. The present 
coalition parties are trying to split the liberal forces. For 
example, we can hear almost daily that, unlike the SZDSZ, the 
Fidesz could be an acceptable coalition partner for the MDF. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] In your opinion, to what extent will the issue of 
Hungarians living beyond our borders and the religious issue 
affect voters' decisions? 
  [Peto] In discussing this issue from the viewpoint of 
political competition, people try to present the SZDSZ in a bad 
light, as an insensitive and indifferent party. However, this 
attempt will not affect the election results. Obviously, those 
who continue to regard symbolic gestures as a major way of 
treating the issue of Hungarian minorities will not vote for the 
SZDSZ. We are speaking to those who are expecting deeds and who 
are not taken in by empty rhetoric. Obviously, those who 
believe that the SZDSZ is an atheist and anti-clerical party 
will not be SZDSZ voters. The SZDSZ attributes great importance 
to religious life and an important social role to the churches; 
at the same time, as a liberal party, the SZDSZ wants a complete 
separation of church and state, and does not find a possible 
state ideological role of the church desirable. [passage omitted] 
  Our views regarding the national minorities have not 
changed. 
The SZDSZ is fostering close contacts with the political 
organizations of Hungarians living beyond our borders, and this 
is advantageous for everyone. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] Are new elements emerging in the election campaign? 
  [Peto] From the beginning, I have noticed manifestations of 
discrimination or manipulation and the abuse of government 
power, which violate the rules of honest political competition. 
However, such attempts are almost always doomed to failure, and 
this is reassuring. This does not harm the SZDSZ; on the 
contrary! However, this does harm the entire Hungarian democracy 
and political style. The control of the mass media, and the 
drama of firing journalists from Hungarian Radio are causing 
such serious damage to Hungarian democracy that it goes far 
beyond the election campaign. If a country can get into the 
world's press with reports of a Csurka essay or the firing of 
129 radio journalists mostly for political reasons, that country 
becomes part of the Balkans in Western public opinion. This 
should draw the attention of those who constantly lecture us on 
national interests while they fail to consider this nation's 
most elementary interests. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] In which areas does the SZDSZ intend to cooperate 
with the government and the coalition in order to maintain the 
ability to function? 
  [Peto] When people were fired from the Hungarian Radio for 
political reasons in a deliberate violation of the law, some 
people in the SZDSZ proposed that we express our indignation by 
limiting our parliamentary activity. However, the dominant 
position in the SZDSZ is that we should not endanger the ability 
of the country and Parliament to function. Parliament should 
work as long as it can, because its activity is needed, and the 
government should also function to the last minute of its 
mandate. If it becomes a government party, the SZDSZ will 
follow the customs of developed democracies, and it will not 
question the obligations deriving from accepted laws, no matter 
what position we took in the course of the legislation. 
Compensation and the return of church properties will also be 
the task of the new government, and we will guarantee continuity 
in this. Of course, there are laws that we will want to change, 
but these changes will not make everyday life unpredictable. The 
SZDSZ does not want a government change accompanied by tabula 
rasa every four years. We have confidence in the members of the 
public administration, and we will not initiate any purge for 
political reasons. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Median's Survey Commissioned by </F>
MAGYAR HIRLAP -- Popularity of Party List Leaders"] 
  [Text] Commissioned by MAGYAR HIRLAP, the Median Public 
Opinion and Market Research Institute regularly examines the 
popularity of the parties' list leaders and people's familiarity 
with them. 
  The change at the top of the popularity of list leaders 
"only" affects the order: The three-point decrease of Gyula 
Horn's [chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP] 
popularity is not statistically significant, but it is enough 
for Janos Palotas [chairman of the Republic Party], who 
continues to enjoy broad popularity, to get into the first 
position. 
  Since the Median's previous survey, familiarity with Gabor 
Kuncze [parliamentary group leader and prime ministerial 
candidate of the Alliance of Free Democrats, SZDSZ] has 
increased significantly (from 64 to 70 percent). In addition to 
being more familiar with people, he has also become more popular 
during the time between the two surveys. In addition to him, 
the views on Tamas Nagy [chairman of the Agrarian Federation], 
Jozsef Torgyan [chairman of the Independent Smallholders Party, 
FKGP], and Istvan Csurka [cochairman of the Hungarian Justice 
and Life Party, MIEP] improved more than the accidental 
deviations. 
  The election campaign that has now started is making an 
impact because, between January and February, the electors have 
become more informed about which party the various politicians 
belong to. The change can be observed in the case of list 
leaders whose party affiliation is still not well known (the 
proportion of people who correctly named the party affiliation 
of Csurka increased from 35 percent to 40 percent, Zoltan Kiraly 
[chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Hungary] from 19 to 
24 percent, Kuncze from 36 to 45 percent, and Tamas Nagy from 17 
to 21 percent). The proportion did not change in the case of 
list leaders whose party affiliation is well known and of Laszlo 
Surjan [chairman of the Christian Democratic People's Party, 
KDNP] and Palotas, therefore, the data also indicate, what 
proportion of the population takes party aspects into 
consideration when assessing the politicians. 
  The popularity averages naturally mainly depend on the 
electors' party sympathies. Out of the list leaders of parties 
that have a significant voting basis, Horn has the highest 
appreciation by his party's supporters: Horn's popularity index 
is 91 points among these people, while it is 45 points among the 
smallholders who like him the least. Surjan was given 87 points 
by his party's supporters and the MSZP supporters gave him 49 
points. Viktor Orban's [chairman of the Federation of Young 
Democrats, Fidesz] popularity with the Fidesz camp is 84 points 
and 46 points with the smallholder supporters. Torgyan is only 
really acceptable for the FKGP's supporters: They gave him 84 
points while he reached the second highest rating (30 points) 
with the Hungarian Democratic Forum's [MDF] supporters. [Prime 
Minister] Peter Boross is more popular with the government 
supproters and the opposition feels antipathy toward him (MDF: 
79 points, KDNP: 69 points, FKGP: 55 points, Fidesz: 47 
points, SZDSZ: 45 points, and MSZP: 40 points). Increasing 
familiarity with Kuncze is also indicated by the fact that while 
his popularity index was only 71 points within his own party's 
supporters in January, the SZDSZ's supporters gave him 79 points 
in February. Kuncze was able to improve his rating mainly with 
those people who have not yet decided which party they will vote 
for: His popularity index improved by 11 percent among these 
people. 
  Boross, Csurka, Surjan, Torgyan, Palotas, and Orban have 
better ratings in the villages than with Budapest people. Horn 
is most popular with people in provincial towns while the 
popularity of Kiraly, Kuncze, and Nagy do not show much 
difference according to the living place of people. 
  Surjan, Palotas, Orban, Nagy, Kiraly, and Boross are more 
popular with women, while Torgyan is rejected less by men than 
by women. Surjan (and his party) is most popular with women over 
the age of 60: In this age group, women rate him 16 points 
higher than men. 
  Boross's and Surjan's popularity increases parallel with the 
age increase of the voters while Orban's decreases. Horn's 
popularity among people between the ages of 50 and 58 is 18 
points higher than in other age groups. Kiraly, Kuncze, and 
Palotas are somewhat less popular among the youngest and oldest 
generation than otherwise. 
  The popularity index of the list leaders is also connected 
to 
the educational level of the voters. The educational level 
fundamentally influences people's habits of acquiring 
information: University graduates gain their information from 
many and diverse sources while less well educated people mainly 
do this from the electronic media. Therefore, it is not 
surprising that politicians who have often and extensively 
appeared on television and radio are more popular among people 
with a low educational level, while the relatively less 
well-known Kuncze who can be found more in the written media is 
more popular among people with high qualifications. This is made 
more complicated by the fact that the popularity of left-wing 
politicians (Horn and Kiraly) does not depend on the educational 
level of the electors. 
  The proportion of those who would welcome the various list 
leaders at the head of the new government after the elections 
has not changed significantly, except in the case of Palotas 
because -- although he took over leadership of the popularity 
list -- fewer people wanted to see him as prime minister in 
February than in January.

vessel proven in the final analysis? 
  [[Gatsinski] The investigation will clarify the 
circumstances under which the vessel left the Bulgarian section 
of the Danube. 
  [Tsvetkov] Have any hijackers been identified? 
  [Gatsinski] The names of the crew members and the others on 
board are known. The investigation will determine whether some 
of them could be described in the way your question implies. 
  [Tsvetkov] Will the incident affect relations between 
Bulgaria and Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)? 
  [Gatsinski] Unfortunately, in contrast with their initially 
declared readiness, the Serbian authorities did not cooperate in 
returning not only the crew, but only the vessel's cargo. 
Despite all this, I believe that after the comprehensive crisis 
in Yugoslavia ends the new states that have emerged there will 
find the place they deserve in Europe. I am convinced that in 
the process of normalizing the status of Yugoslavia (Serbia and 
Montenegro) in the international community our relations will 
develop actively as good neighbors, on the basis of mutual 
economic benefit. 
  [Tsvetkov] Would you like to forecast a new development, or 
do you consider the case closed? 
  [Gatsinski] The case will be closed after the investigation 
ends and the culprits are punished.

Bulgarian Press of `Crude Provocations'"] 
  [Text] In connection with the letter of the "Great 
Romania" Legion, which was published by several dailies and also 
received by the editorial board of NOVINI 5, we asked the 
Romanian Embassy in Sofia and Lyuben Beshkov, chairman of the 
Dobrudzha All-Bulgarian Union, to comment. 
  Beshkov expressed alarm with the "recent statements of the 
`Great Romania' Legion, which considers Dobrudzha a native 
Romanian land." "We expect the Bulgarian authorities not to 
keep silent any longer regarding those `innocent jokes' on the 
part of certain nationalistic circles in Romania." 
  For his part Teodor Tolea, press secretary of the Romanian 
Embassy, expressed indignation with those "attempts to 
artificially exacerbate tension in bilateral relations," while 
Mr. Gherceanu, first secretary of the Romanian Embassy, said 
over the telephone: 
  "What was published in the Bulgarian press about certain 
territorial claims, Greater Romania, and so forth, is not only 
falsehood but also a crude provocation. Our country has 
repeatedly declared that it has no territorial claims vis-a-vis 
Bulgaria. We have always adhered to good-neighborly relations 
and mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. 
However, we encountered already on several occasions such 
publications in certain Bulgarian newspapers. It appears that 
TRUD uses a double standard. If the Bulgarian minority in 
Romania has its organization, newspaper, and representatives in 
the parliament, does that mean that it also has separatist 
intentions?"

  [Text] An agreement on exchanging operational information 
regarding nuclear installations is to be signed between Bulgaria 
and Turkey. The negotiations related to the agreement have been 
completed. The draft agreement was approved by the Council of 
Ministers in 1991. It will positively affect bilateral 
relations with Turkey and will serve as the basis of cooperating 
in utilizing nuclear energy, the experts of the Committee on 
Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy think. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Environment Ministry, 
the National Electricity Company, and the Kozloduy Nuclear Power 
Plant have already conveyed their recommendations and have 
approved the agreement. It will be identical to the agreement 
with Greece, which has been signed and ratified. 
  The agreement does not relate to admissible concentrations 
of 
radioactive substances according to the national norms. Once a 
year the sides will exchange information about radioactive 
particles which have found their way into the environment. 
There will be a one-time exchange of information regarding the 
nuclear installations. However, the validity of this 
information will be confirmed every January.

<F P=106> [Stiliyan Ivanov report: "Purge in Army Begins With </F>
Rakovski Legion"] 
  [Text] The list of Rakovski Officer Legion members who are 
to be cut from the army have already been added as an appendix 
to Minister Valentin Aleksandrov's decree on optimizing army 
personnel. DUMA has learned from a well-informed Rakovski 
Legion source that the Defense Ministry and the General Staff 
are behind these cuts. 
  The massive cuts were expected to take place on the eve of 
the Rakovski Legion Second Congress, which will take place at 
the beginning of June. The Legion's officers assume that 
Minister Valentin Aleksandrov and highranking officers from the 
General Staff, among them, P. Petkov, Z. Iliev, P. Shushkov, and 
others, were behind the attack against the legion. The first 
announcements of the cuts are expected any day now. Major 
General Denev, commander of the 2d Army, has personally banned 
the distribution of Rakovski Legion documents. 
  It is assumed that the settling of accounts between the 
chiefs of the Defense Ministry and the General Staff began after 
the meeting of the dismissed Rakovski Legion spokesman, Captain 
Second Rank Vasil Danov, and President Zhelev, at which Danov 
reportedly expressed the Legion's indignation with the fact that 
the General Staff payroll was inflated, viewed against the 
background of the meager Armed Forces' budget. 
  According to Rakovski Legion sources, the General Staff is 
trying to split their organization through persons the General 
Staff planted in the Legion's leadership. It is expected that 
in the next few days the Legion will convene an extraordinary 
confederative council, at which it will formulate its tactics 
regarding behavior in contacts with the ministry and General 
Staff. The Legion will also inform EUROMIL, of which it is a 
member, about developments. High-ranking active service and 
reserve officers assume that persecution of the Legion will 
exacerbate relations between junior officers and high-ranking 
commanders, and between the various army branches. Major 
General Mikho Mikhov, Air Force and Air Defense commander, has 
already said he objects to the envisaged cuts. 
  Despite the announcement of the Defense Ministry Press 
Center 
that there will be no cuts as an end in itself, the officers 
complain that Ground Forces Commander General Totomirov has not 
intervened in favor of any Rakovski Legion officer who has been 
cut. 
  In response to a National Assembly member's question on 11 
March Minister Aleksandrov said that the Legion members who had 
been dismissed had violated the regulations and the principle of 
one-man command, and therefore their penalties were totally 
justified. He pointed out that he will preserve the spirit of 
partnership between the ministry and the Legion. 
  After his return from Brussels, Army General Lyuben Petrov, 
commander of the General Staff, expressed almost the same 
position to DUMA. According to him the dismissals were a 
correct sanction, and that personally, he has nothing against 
the Rakovski Legion officers, as long as they observe the 
regulations. The officers have the right to present their 
social claims, but they must do so through established 
procedures and not through petitions, the General Staff 
commander said.

<F P=106> [Pencho Kovachev commentary: "Tension Under Shoulder Strap"] </F>
  [Text] Recently President Zhelev's pen has been working 
overtime because of the military. 
  From one side the commander in chief receives a decree on 
releasing generals and admirals from the military service, while 
from the other lists of officers who covet the general rank. 
  In such situations it is very important whether one hand 
knows what the other is doing. 
  It is not a tragedy for the Army if four generals retire 
simultaneously. Anyway, there are more generals on the payroll 
than our Army needs. Furthermore, in the General Staff and in 
the Ground Troops Command there are more generals than desks. 
  The problem with eventual cuts in the Army is more 
complicated. In this sphere the commander in chief, [Defense] 
Minister Valentin Aleksandrov, and the head of the General Staff 
are between the hammer and the anvil. On the one side there is 
the budget plight that hovers over the officers, and on the 
other the war that rages only 500 km from our border. Even King 
Solomon himself would have difficulties in resolving this 
problem, but this is no justification for either staying idle or 
adopting hasty decisions. 
  Obviously, the problem could only be resolved by experts, 
who 
would objectively consider all arguments for and against the 
cuts, without being interested at all in the political 
manipulations of parties, leaders, legions, and alliances, which 
utilize the national security problems for promoting their own 
interests. 
  Any other decision regarding the Army's fate could have 
unpredictable consequences.

<F P=106> [Editorial commentary: "Our Army Looks Toward Russia, Our </F>
Generals Toward the United States"] 
  [Text] In sending three delegations to the United States 
at the same time our military chiefs have broken a record. 
  Ostensibly, our arms are Russian, we cry out for spare parts 
from Moscow and Kiev, the army does not have a penny to its 
name, and yet our generals constantly look toward the West. 
  The chief of General Staff returned from Brussels and left 
immediately for NATO's Atlantic headquarters in Norfolk. All 
right, in Belgium we at least have certain interests -- we are 
about to send our representatives to NATO headquarters -- but 
what business do we have with the Atlantic? 
  In addition, the fact that three delegations are heading for 
the United States shows that there is apparently no coordination 
between the General Staff and the Ministry of Defense in 
anything related to the Army cuts and visits abroad.

<F P=106> [Untitled commentary by Georgi Mantarov] </F>
  [Text] Formally, our army is more independent than even 
the North Korean Army, and yet its international activity 
becomes ever more obvious. We could even claim that we 
contribute to world military science. 
  Chiefs of departments, staffs, and regiments compete with 
each other to visit foreign countries, and at the same time our 
Turkish neighbors prefer to train their soldiers in our country. 
Naturally, at our expense. First, it is cheaper, and second, 
if anything happens, they will be one step ahead. 
  The so-called lower-ranking commanders of the Bulgarian Army 
cannot refuse to train people who will later join the reserve 
troops of the Turkish rather than the Bulgarian Army. Here and 
there it has been suggested that the recruits from across the 
border have a suspiciously great interest in our arms and army 
structures, but all this remains within the realm of specualtion. 
  The National Assembly members, ostensibly concerned with the 
well-being of our motherland, are in no hurry to adopt the armed 
forces bill. For the time being, the bill has a loophole that 
allows even our officers to have dual citizenship. True, people 
who are torn between two countries cannot become officers, but 
no one can prevent active officers from acquiring another 
passport if they so wish. 
  Under these circumstances why should the army officers be 
angry because the army does not have enough money? There is no 
reason to be, if our army can train the cadres of our 
traditional rivals free of charge.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Independent Trade Unions Face a </F>
Big Riddle"] 
  [Text] The Union of Independent Trade Unions [BSPSh] 
started its first congress on Monday [21 March]. Although 
scheduled to start at 0930, this, the highest trade union forum, 
began its proceedings after a 45-minute delay. This was because 
of the late arrival of President Berisha, guest of honor at the 
congress. Berisha, whose office is a few yards from the Palace 
of Congresses where the BSPSh were meeting, entered the hall to 
applause, creating the kind of image we had long forgotten -- 
that of a political leader attending a trade union meeting. 
Berisha made his presence all the more strongly felt when he 
announced to the floor that he "had followed developments within 
the BSPSh with close attention." It is not known whether this 
phrase of the president may constitute a warning to the 
fractionist group within Xheka's "anticommunist" trade union. 
It could be the reason for the head of state's attendance at 
the BSPSh Congress. None of the separatists figured in the list 
of members of the Presidium who were to chair the plenary 
sessions. 
  Three years after its foundation, the BSPSh finds itself on 
the verge of a split. Not even the opening speech made by 
veteran trade unionist Llukan Prifti could evoke the old days of 
ferment and struggle against communist governments. There were 
harsh words about "attempts at division" even in the report on 
the BSPSh's three years of work, delivered by BSPSh Secretary 
Vilson Qendro. According to Qendro, divisive individuals within 
the ranks of the trade union are incited by political parties 
who wish to take over the uncompromising struggle that the BSPSh 
is waging in the interests of workers. Qendro called them "the 
spawn of the dictatorship," and accused them of using "gangster 
methods" in their activities. Nevertheless, he did not mention 
any names in his speech. According to the report as delivered, 
the struggle of the BSPSh is now moving into a new phase. Its 
coalition with right-wing parties led to their assumption of 
power. The government has now reduced to a minimum its dialogue 
with the trade unions and parts of the legislation now approved 
can be considered antidemocratic. Meanwhile, according to Vilson 
Qendro, the BSPSh now demands wages linked to the inflation 
index, an end to lay-offs, and the distribution of national 
assets in the form of vouchers. 
  The first sessions of the BSPSh Congress showed no signs of 
these conflicts, which will not, apparently, be made public this 
time either. The atmosphere in the hall and Berisha's greeting 
encouraging Xheka may finally have tilted the scales in favor of 
the present Presidium. The congress will continue its 
proceedings today, its second and final day.

<F P=106> [Lorenc Vangjeli report: "Appeal Court Sentences </F>
Journalists Frangaj and Leka and Officers Licaj and Feta"] 
  [Text] Journalism is without a doubt the most dangerous 
profession in Albania. The second act of the drama of the 
journalists Aleksander Frangaj and Martin Leka, staged this time 
at the Tirana Appeals Court, has convincingly proved this once 
again. Arrested on 31 January this year on charges preferred by 
the Defense Ministry and on a warrant signed by Prosecutor 
Qeleshi, the two journalists tasted the bitterness of detention 
on remand for one month. The charge they faced was of revealing 
a state secret in collusion with officers Licaj and Feta, while 
Leka also faced the charge of public slander against Defense 
Minister Zhulali. At the four-day trial at the Tirana District 
Court, Leka's charge of slander was not proved, and the 
collusion "thought to have been" entered into by the four turned 
out to involve only Leka and Licaj. Frangaj, editor in chief of 
the independent newspaper KOHA JONE, was acquitted, while his 
colleague Leka was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment for 
"colluding to reveal a state secret." One month later all hopes 
of overturning this verdict in the Appeals Court turned out to 
be illusory. After the appeal lodged by the three defendants 
Leka, Licaj, and Feta and the protest made by Prosecutor Qeleshi 
over Frangaj's acquittal, it was the turn of Appeals Court Judge 
Prel Martini to dispense justice. Of course, Mr. Martini will 
have been aware of the dozens of protests by European and world 
journalists' organizations for the release of the two Albanian 
journalists. However, he and the modern Albanian state that he 
serves showed once again that the bell tolls only for those who 
want to listen. After a judicial hearing of five hours, Judge 
Martini pronounced both journalists guilty and sentenced Martin 
Leka to 18 months imprisonment and Aleksander Frangaj to five 
months. 
  How did the trial go? 
  It started at 0900 yesterday with the reading of the 
defendants' appeals, in which they asked for the initial court 
verdict to be overturned, for an acquittal, and for the 
application of justice. It was the Appeals Court's task to 
examine the legitimacy of the earlier court verdict. Leka's 
lawyer Agim Tirana announced that he wanted an end to "this 
illegal sham," and demanded his client's acquittal. He argued 
that there was no legal basis for the crime committed by Leka 
and Licaj and claimed that no such thing had been proved by the 
earlier court, which had even based its conclusions not on the 
documents of the case but on guesswork. Moreover, as a 
journalist, Leka could not be held liable to a charge of 
revealing a state secret and therefore could not be punished for 
such a crime. However, surprises were not long in coming. 
Although Leka had been arrested under the signature of 
Prosecutor Qeleshi for public slander against Defense Minister 
Zhulali, no such accusation had arrived at the Prosecutor's 
Office. Indeed, the first trial had been unable to prove that 
Leka had commited slander. However, Prosecutor Mosko produced 
from among the papers in the file a charge preferred by the 
Defense Ministry that lacked a couple of minor features, i.e. a 
rubber stamp and a protocol number. 
  The Tirana Court's declaration of Frangaj's innocence turned 
out to be premature for District Prosecutor Qeleshi. Qeleshi 
protested and called for Frangaj's conviction on the basis of 
Article 20 of the Press Law. It was the turn of Prosecutor 
Mosko to write the speech that was successfully to bury the 
public's hopes that the state would this time sign a peace 
treaty with the press. In the one hour that Mosko demanded he 
managed to pull to shreds the one month's investigation of the 
journalists made while they were on remand and also the courts 
questioning of them. This prosecutor, who in 1990 warned 
defendants who had blown up Uncle Stalin with dynamite that he 
would not allow them to insult the power of the people, and who 
often sweated during the public defense of Hoxha's widow, 
concluded that the crimes of the four defendants should be 
legally reclassified. In his speech, he believed he had proved 
that Martin Leka had commited slander and had offended against 
Article 20 of the Press Law, that Aleksander Frangaj must be 
considered guilty because he allowed the article to be 
published, and that Licaj and Feta had abused their positions. 
  The dissatisfaction in the courtroom reached new heights at 
1400, when the presiding judge read out the verdict, this time 
open to appeal only at the Higher Appeals Court. 
  The word "guilty" uttered by Martini buried once and for all 
the hopes of the most optimistic. Martini called for 18 months 
for Martin Leka for his "sin" of having slandered the defense 
minister and violating Article 20 of the Press Law, four years 
for officer Licaj, and a suspended sentence of six months for 
officer Feta. 
  Thus, the second act of this drama ended without providing 
an 
answer to the question that was at the focus of this trial. Was 
Defense Minister Zhulali's order a secret? It was so for the 
court, but not for the defendants and their lawyers, who 
asserted that "a secret ceases to be a secret when it emerges 
from government offices into the streets and becomes known to 
thousands of people." However, "you need a stone to crack 
walnuts," and in Albania journalists have nothing but their 
ballpoints and a Press Law that states that the press is free.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 23 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces 
Wednesday [23 March] hijacked a 10-truck UN aid convoy headed 
for the northern town of Maglaj and briefly abducted the 
drivers, the United Nations said. 
  The trucks had left Zagreb in the morning with 90 tonnes of 
food and other relief material and were seized in the Tezlic 
region southwest of the Moslem city, officials said. The 
drivers were abducted and held for several hours, and turned up 
later in the town of Zepce, controlled by Bosnian Croat forces, 
said Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees. 
  "It's a very serious incident," he said. One of the trucks 
was later recovered but it was empty, he added. 
  Maglaj received its first aid convoy in five months on 
Sunday 
after Serb forces that had been attacking it eased their siege. 
The town has a population of around 16,000.

Maglaj was stopped today near the village of Crna Rijeka west of 
Novi Seher because the road was mined, we have learned from 
Srpska republic army sources. 
  The convoy was stopped and all personnel were warned that 
the 
road was mined. The drivers and crew left the vehicles, and the 
Srpska republic army provided safety for the convoy to avoid the 
possibility of theft and plunder. 
  According to Serb military sources, claims published by 
foreign media that the Srpska army plundered the convoy were 
incorrect. This is yet another attempt at vilifying and 
accusing the Serb side of a lack of cooperation, the Srpska 
republic army sources say.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 24 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic has promised his forces will return nine UN 
aid-convoy trucks stolen near the northern town of Maglaj, the 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said Thursday [24 
March]. A meeting was scheduled later Thursday in the Bosnian 
Serb stronghold of Pale between the head of the UNHCR mission in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina, Karin Abu-Zayd, and the separatist 
republic's vice-president Nikola Koljevic, said UNHCR spokesman 
Kris Janowski. 
  Karadzic had personally assured UN special representative to 
ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi the trucks would be returned as 
soon as possible, Janowski said. Convoys would again start 
moving from the Croatian capital Zagreb to the Maglaj region 
once the United Nations obtained security guarantees, he said, 
adding that convoys however were still leaving from Zenica, in 
central Bosnia. 
  The stolen trucks were parked at a Bosnian Serb barracks in 
Tezlic, southwest of Maglaj, a mainly-Moslem enclave which 
received its first aid convoy in five months on Sunday after 
Serb forces eased their siege, the spokesman said. 
  Rogue Bosnian Serb forces hijacked a 10-truck UN aid convoy 
taking 94 tonnes of food and other aid to Maglaj on Wednesday 
near Teslic. Serb soldiers, led by a colonel whom Karadzic said 
would be punished, threatened the Danish drivers and forced them 
to abandon the trucks, Jankowski said. The Serbs starting 
loading the trucks' contents onto civilian trucks, but when it 
turned out to be a lengthy operation, they stole the trucks, the 
spokesman said, adding that Serb police guarding the convoy 
"evaporated." The Danish drivers were abducted, then found a few 
hours later at Zepce, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) to the 
south, in a Bosnian Croat-held area. One of the trucks was 
recovered later, he said. 
  Jankowski described the theft as a "very serious incident." 
He said Pale late Wednesday "declared itself quite upset and 
surprised" at what had happened. 
  Two UNHCR convoys have reached Maglaj from Zenica and two 
others from Tesanj, north of Maglaj, since British UN 
peacekeepers entered the town Sunday. Before that, the town of 
16,000 had been supplied for the past five months mainly by air 
drops. No convoys had been sent in since October, when two 
Danish drivers of a UNHCR convoy were assassinated as they were 
entering Maglaj.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 24 March carries in its 
regular 7-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in the 
republic. 
  Describing the situation in Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that 
"Karadzic's terrorists and Abdic's paramilitaries are continuing 
to cooperate in destroying this part of Bosnia-Herzegovina. All 
last night, particularly after midnight, they pounded the 
defense positions on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, Hasin Vrh, 
and Barakovac with artillery and tanks. They attempted an 
infantry breakthrough yesterday evening but our defenders 
managed to repel it with great effort." He says that "the 
members of the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa 
autonomy have been using artillery since yesterday against the 
Cazin districts of Krivaja, (Liskovac), and (?Prle). They also 
used chemical agents, and Osa and Zolja portable rocket 
launchers. This is continuing this morning. They have massacred 
six members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina [B-H] Army, and captured 
several others." 
  Viktor Boban reports from Maglaj from the theater of 
operations of the B-H Army Operative Group Bosna that "yesterday 
evening the Chetniks intensified their attacks on Rujnica, in 
the region of Zeleni Kamen, and combined it with an attempt at 
an infantry breakthrough. However, our defenders had no 
problems repelling this enemy attack." He says that "this 
morning after 0500 the Chetniks launched a savage artillery and 
infantry attack on several parts of the Rujnica defense lines. 
The B-H Army was ready for this attack, and responded with equal 
ferocity so the valley of the Bosna River is reverberating to 
heavy explosions. The general alarm has been sounded and the 
population is in shelters. At the moment of filing this report 
shells are pounding the town." 
  The B-H Army 4th Corps Information Service reports that "the 
cease-fire on the Mostar front over the last 24 hours has not 
been fully observed. Extremists from the Croatian Defense 
Council have been less active than over the last few days but 
they still fired a few grenades from a portable grenade launcher 
at the demarcation lines in the city. Elsewhere the cease-fire 
has held."

  [Text] Bonn, March 24 (AFP) -- Germany is to provide a 
civil administrator for the war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina town of 
Mostar on behalf of the European Union, a source close to the 
nominee confirmed Thursday [24 March]. 
  The Social Democrat (SPD) former mayor of Bremen, Hans 
Kochnick, has been named by the European Union in agreement with 
the German government, SPD foreign affairs official Karsten 
Voigt told AFP. 
  Voigt said it had been envisaged for some time to send 
Kochnick to the town as its administrator, and this was set to 
materialise "as peace slowly comes to Bosnia-Herzegovina". 
  DER SPIEGEL magazine reported a month ago that a German 
civil 
administrator was to be sent to Mostar, and would be assisted in 
restoring public services by German police and civil servants. 
  Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Wednesday that he favoured 
Germany taking a role in reconstruction efforts in former 
Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Petrovac, March 23 (TANJUG) -- Fierce inter-Moslem 
battles in the Bihac-Cazin region (Moslem enclave in western 
Bosnia) continued on Wednesday and the command of troops loyal 
to the Sarajevo Moslem authorities admitted that the fighting so 
far left about 500 dead and 2,000 wounded Moslems. This is the 
first time that forces of radical Moslem leader Alija 
Izetbegovic admitted to sustaining heavy losses both in manpower 
and weaponry in the battles with the Moslems of the autonomous 
province of western Bosnia. In western Bosnia the opponents of 
Izetbegovic clashed last September with the forces loyal to the 
Sarajevo authorities who were ordered to use all means to curb 
the new autonomy. The new province's media reports that the army 
of the province's president, Fikret Abdic, is slowly advancing 
towards Liskovac, Krivaja and Trsce without suffering any losses 
while Izetbegovic's troops are sustaining heavy losses. Moslem 
Sarajevo Radio confirmed these reports and added that the 
fighting is spreading to the other border area in the Cazin 
region and that all types of weapons are in use. 
  Over the past 24 hours, Izetbegovic's troops in the region 
of 
Bihac, western Bosnia, opened sporadic fire on Serb positions 
along the entire frontline, Bosnian Serb military sources said. 
According to them, the Serbs did not have any casualties and did 
not return fire. The Moslem forces in the region of Doboj, 
northern Bosnia, continued offensive amd provocative actions on 
Serb positions and settlements, the Bosnian Serb military 
sources said. 
  The Moslem troops were especially agressive in the 
southwestern Trebava front (northeast of Doboj) where they 
attempted to penetrate Serb defence lines. Similar to the 
previous nine attacks in the past week, the latest one was 
unsuccessful.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 22 (AFP) -- Plans to ease the siege 
of Sarajevo further by opening roads out of the city have been 
jeopardized at the last minute by both the Serb and Moslem 
sides, the United Nations said Tuesday. It did not elaborate. 
Two roads leading out of Sarajevo are due to re-open Wednesday: 
one leading to central Bosnia, one to the south. The bridge 
linking the city to the Serb-held suburb of Grbavica is also due 
to open, as is a road between two Serb-held suburbs, Lukavica et 
Ilidza. The routes were to be opened for limited civilian 
traffic. But UN Protection Force [United Nations Protection 
Force] spokesman Major Simon MacDowell said unspecified problems 
were threatening the moves. The "difficulties are coming from 
both sides," he said, giving no further details. 
  The nearly two-year Serb siege of the city eased last month 
when the Serbs gave in to a NATO ultimatum and removed many 
heavy weapons that had been ringing Sarajevo. But on Monday, UN 
forces found Serb heavy weapons including tanks, anti-aircraft 
guns and mortars inside the NATO-imposed exclusion zone around 
Sarajevo. MacDowell said the find made by Canadian troops late 
Sunday was a "big violation" of the NATO demilitarization plan. 
MacDowell said Tuesday that civilian affairs representative 
Diyan Milov met Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic Tuesday 
evening, and subsequently travelled to Lukavica.

  [Text] Brcko, March 24 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem units 
continued Thursday attacks from heavy infantry weapons on the 
Serb positions in the Brcko region, northeast 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bosnian Serb military sources have reported. 
  There were stronger armed provocations during the night of 
Wednesday-Thursday by Moslem and Croat forces against the Serb 
defence lines on other war zones in the Sava River region. 
Provocations ceased after the Bosnian Serb army responded. 
  The Bosnian Serb military sources also reported that, 
besides 
infantry weapons, the Bosnian Moslem forces used mortars and 
anti-aircraft guns in their attacks on the Serb positions in the 
Teslic, Doboj and Mt Ozren war zones. 
  Moslem forces' attempt to infiltrate commando-reconnaissance 
teams behind the Serb positions in the Mt Ozren area was foiled 
by the Bosnian Serbs.

<F P=106> [By Dusan Zupan] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, March 24 (TANJUG) -- A report from the 
United Nations that the Security Council agrees to Turkey's 
sending its troops to the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina unavoidably arouse associations on the 
stories about a goat which is supposed to watch over the cabbage 
and a wolf which is supposed to protect the sheep. 
  Such lack of sensitivity on the part of the U.N., which is 
sending to Bosnia-Herzegovina troops whose government has long 
since declared itself clearly on whose side it is, is simply 
amazing. Turkey has assisted Bosnian Moslems from the first day 
of their secession -- politically, militarily, financially, 
morally. Turkish war correspondents, have publicly boasted in 
their papers of having shot at and killed "infidels". If this 
is so among reporters then what may one expect the Turkish 
troops might do. 
  By adopting the stand that Turkey may send troops to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the U.N. has broken its own vow that former 
occupying forces could not be among the U.N. peacekeeping force 
in a respective country. Turks have been occupiers on the 
territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina for full 500 years. 
  For the Bosnian Moslems, Turkey means incomparably more than 
Russia does to the Serbs. Even the family of Bosnian Moslem 
leader Alija Izetbegovic lives in Turkey. On the other side, 
Russia has never been an occupying force on these territories, 
nor has its troops impaled the Moslems here. However, as 
regards the Serbs and Turks -- it is different story. 
  All in all, the U.N. decision, among many others which it 
took under pressure, testifies about further moral degradation 
of the world organization. Moral strength has always been its 
mightiest weapon, now this too is lost. 
  If the Turks, nevertheless, arrive to Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
the 
only true balance might be achieved by calling on the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia to send its troops there too. Everything 
else looks as poorly veiled hypocrisy the objective of which is 
to threaten the lives of Serbs and their property, and this not 
only in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Hamid Deronjic report from Brcko] </F>
  [Text] The aggressor has intensified his attacks on the 
Brcko front, where -- since the outbreak of the war -- there has 
been fierce fighting against these Serbian-Montenegrin occupying 
forces. This morning at 0530 [0430 GMT] the Chetniks launched a 
fierce artillery and tank attack on the central part of the 
Brcko defense. From the direction of Cadjavac, the enemy has 
been firing from tanks and 120-mm mortars, and with antiaircraft 
guns and machine guns from several positions. This morning's 
attack on our positions has just been the continuation of what 
the aggressor was up to on the Brcko front overnight, when the 
defense lines were exposed to enemy attacks from recoilless 
guns, mortars, hand grenades, and antiaircraft guns and machine 
guns. Djukici and the central part of the Brcko defense were 
the main target of the aggressor's attacks. 
  The key part of the so-called northern corridor is the 
reason 
why the free Brcko territory has been under constant and fierce 
offensives by the Serbian aggressor ever since the outbreak of 
the war. That this is not going to end is confirmed by frequent 
reports on attacks by our forces that can be heard on Radio 
Bastille [radio bastilja, derogatory term for Belgrade Radio]. 
This, the central nervous system of Serbian fascism, has been 
spreading lies about alleged offensives of our units on the 
temporarily occupied Brcko, and thus calling for a new 
mobilization of Serbs in the so-called Yugoslavia for the Brcko 
front. 
  The alertness and combat readiness of our fighters, and the 
high morale of all the citizens of the free Brcko territory are 
in line with the seriousness and importance of the Brcko front.

  [Text] The consultative convention of the Serbian people 
was held in Tuzla today. The convention adopted the [word 
indistinct] declaration and elected delegates to the assembly of 
the Serbian Civic Council, which will be held in Sarajevo on 27 
March. Dr. Mirko Pejanovic, member of the Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, attended the meeting. Our correspondent 
Enes Osmancevic reports on the meeting: 
  [Begin recording] [Osmancevic] With the genuine feeling of 
overall affiliation to Bosnia-Herzegovina as an irrefutable 
historical fact, we voice our reason and spirit against 
national-fascism expressed in the genocide, which was aimed not 
only at creating ethnically pure areas but also at destroying 
basic human values. This is the basic message of the 
consultative convention of the Serbian people held in Tuzla 
today, which was attended by Dr. Mirko Pejanovic, member of the 
Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The fact that we wanted to live on this territory and that 
we 
remain living here is the best proof that we did not succumb to 
Greater Serbia national hysteria. We voice our condemnation of 
the inspirers and perpetrators of war crimes, it is said in the 
joint statement of ethnic Serb citizens who attended today's 
convention. 
  Rejecting, as he put it, all forms of tribal loyalty to 
Karadzic, Koljevic, and Plavsic, (Miso) Bozic expressed the 
stand that was accepted as the basis for the statement by Tuzla 
delegates to the forthcoming Sarajevo convention. It reads as 
follows: We accept joint life in Bosnia-Herzegovina as an 
independent, sovereign, united state within its internationally 
recognized borders, which was for centuries adorned by a 
multinational and multicultural character. 
  Addressing the people present, Dr. Mirko Pejanovic, member 
of 
the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, proposed the following: 
  [Pejanovic] [Words indistinct] halting of all military 
activities and offensives on the part of the Serbian side with 
the decisive pressure by the international community to control 
a cease-fire and peace in all points [words indistinct]. 
  Second, we demand that the Serbian side be included in 
negotiations on an overall peaceful solution for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina under the auspices of the United Nations, the 
United States, the European Union, the Russian Federation, other 
countries, and all other factors participating in determining 
our destiny. 
  Third, we think that the federal [word indistinct] setup 
based on cantons is a basis for reaching a global solution for 
peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What is really involved is a 
slight modification of the well-known Vance-Owen plan, which was 
not given full support (?then) in the given historical 
situation. In our opinion, that is one of the best solutions 
that keeps the wholeness of Bosnia-Herzegovina and enables 
equality of the peoples, as well as self-assurance [samobitnost] 
and cultural autonomy. 
  Fourth, we think that Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a joint state 
of 
equal peoples, in its wholeness within internationally 
recognized borders, according to the Republican Presidency's 
platform on the work under war conditions, has economic, 
cultural, and national interests of Muslims, Serbs, and Croats. 
  Fifth, we propose that it is in the ultimate interest of all 
peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina that the state of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina join the union of European countries and 
thereby ensure its economic and cultural prosperity and 
restoration [words indistinct] interests in Europe. [applause] 
  Sixth, I propose to demand that the Serbian Civic Council 
take part in negotiations with the international community on 
the political future of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Serbian Civic 
Council will be constituted in Sarajevo on Sunday [27 March] as 
the proponent of the interests of ethnic Serbian citizens in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina who favor a just peace, the equality of 
peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina, civil and human rights, and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in its historical and internationally 
recognized borders. [applause] 
  [Osmancevic] Supporting the assembly of ethnic Serb citizens 
which, as was said, together with the Pan-Bosniak convention and 
the assembly of Croats, is striving toward a full respect for 
human and civil rights, which are a prerequisite of a modern 
democratic society in which national, cultural, religious, and 
other characteristics of all citizens of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be respected, cherished, and admired, 
the Serb People's Convention held in Tuzla today has elected 
delegates to the Sarajevo assembly, where the Serbian Civic 
Council will be constituted. [end recording]

  [Text] Deputies of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly who are 
in Sarajevo held a meeting today that dealt with organizing an 
assembly meeting for Monday, 28 March, and issues connected to 
the Washington agreement regarding the work of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly. Senada Cumurovic has the details: 
  [Begin recording] [Cumurovic] At the beginning of today's 
meeting, Assembly Secretary Avdo Campara announced that the 
assembly meeting will be held on Monday, 28 March. Deputies of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Parliament will be able to express their 
views on the documents of the Washington agreement and adopt 
decisions on the future work of the assembly. Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic will speak at the assembly meeting on the 
political elements of the Washington agreement, while the expert 
portion will be expounded upon by Kasim Trnka, minister of the 
judiciary. 
  In the second part of today's meeting, Dr. Trnka briefed the 
assembly deputies on the section of the Washington agreement 
that applies to the future work and setup of the assembly, 
pointing out that two significant (?aims) have been broached in 
the chapter on transient provisions: Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
international subjectivity and the internal continuity of 
institutions, especially the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Since there is a possibility that the 28 March meeting could 
turn into a constitutional assembly, Minister Trnka expounded on 
this possibility: 
  [Trnka] This means that during the debate about the 
proffered documents, the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina may in 
fact turn into a constitutional assembly, which consists of 
deputies of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly elected in the 1990 
elections whose term of office is still valid. This assembly 
would function as a constitutional assembly. One should take 
care not to [words indistinct] that the constitution is adopted 
in a way that the consensus of deputies who feel as Croats and 
the deputies who feel as Bosniaks be devalued. However, this 
national consensus is not sufficient. What is also needed is a 
two-thirds majority of the overall number of deputies. This in 
fact means that all other deputies have the same right to vote. 
  If this constitution, which is for the time being only a 
proposal [words indistinct] political agreement, is adopted, 
then the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly will continue its work 
having two functions -- as the Assembly of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina which is going to continue to adopt decisions 
concerning the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its 
international relations and the Assembly of the Federation, 
whose competences encompass only the territory that is, by 
definition, populated by the majority Bosniak and Muslim 
population and, regarding its factual borders, (?when borders 
are definitely established) in the talks with the third side and 
in the talks about canonization of this federation. 
  [Cumurovic] After providing an explanation, Dr. Kasim Trnka 
answered several questions from the deputies. Questions focused 
on, for example, how the occupied part of Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
defined in the agreement and who is supposed to pay war 
reparations. Dr. Trnka said that the agreement used the term of 
the territory with the majority Serbian population and as for 
war reparations, they are to be reimbursed by the state. [Words 
indistinct] establish the ways how to obtain the funds. 
  The deputies today were informed that (Nazim Koledar) has 
been released from the camp, while Irfan Ajanovic is still 
(?detained). Concerning this, as well as some other cases, the 
Human Rights commission will meet and discuss the release of 
prisoners according to the already reached agreements.

<F P=106> [Report by Branka Mitrovic: "Softened, Calculating, or </F>
Maladjusted"] 
  [Text] "The Srpska republic will endeavor to adjust 
its interests to the general situation." 
  This short sentence, stated by Radovan Karadzic after his 
latest meeting with Vitaliy Churkin, with whom he exchanged 
opinions about the further course of the peace process, means 
that the latest initiative made by Washington and Moscow for 
finding a settlement of the Bosnian conflict without Serb 
participation will soon fail. Still, the initiative inevitably 
raises the question of whether the Serbs will know how to make 
good use of that general situation, without losing much. That 
question is bothering Karadzic, who has been put under pressure, 
on one hand by flexible, ready-to-discuss-everything Milosevic, 
as Churkin describes him, and, on the other hand, by his own 
army, and for the greatest part by Ratko Mladic and the citizens 
of the Srpska republic themselves, who are unanimous in the 
attitude that the aforementioned flexibility is leading directly 
toward a defeat! 
  As the majority of Serbs believe, since the beginning of the 
war the Bosnian Serbs have not been asked for their opinion on 
any issue, particularly when the idea was born in Washington 
that Croats and Muslims should be forced to agree to a joint 
state. In the first moment, precisely for that reason, the 
Serbs refused any talks about possibly joining with the 
Croatian-Muslim federation, while the same attitude was held by 
the leadership of the Srpska republic. 
  Having decided that the whole story is about the 
establishment of a military alliance that will look forward to 
aiming its artillery at the other bank of Drina River, of 
course, supported by the foreign assistance, the leadership in 
Pale quickly started to contemplate how to protect itself, 
without once more provoking the superior force in the sky. 
Aleksa Buha [Srpska foreign minister] was happy to substantiate 
why their apprehensions are not merely a kind of phobia. He has 
noticed that, in Split, Generals Ante Roso and Rasim Kadic 
hurried to sign the agreement on the federal army, even though 
the Constitution of the new Muslim-Croatian state was far from 
having a definite shape. At the same time, Buha reminds us that 
the agreement on the military alliance signed by Franjo Tudjman 
and Alija Izetbegovic still exists. Therefore he told Churkin, 
just as Karadzic and Nikola Koljevic had done, that he could 
feel free to inform Washington that the Srpska republic would 
not start solving any issue without having previously signed a 
peace agreement with the new federation, because, at the latest 
talks in Vienna it had been said that the federation of Croats 
and Muslims should take in as much as 60 percent of the 
territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
<H5>  What Is the Next Step? </H5>
  Nevertheless, the Bosnian Serbs still started to adjust 
themselves to the situation, thinking: What is the next step? 
  So that the first thing that Karadzic actually faced was the 
demand that the Serbs should make certain concessions. To the 
surprise of many people, Karadzic immediately said he was ready 
to cede around 16 percent of the territory under the control of 
the Bosnian Serbs. However, both Washington and Moscow made it 
clear to him that he is supposed to soften up his attitude even 
more, and in that respect, nothing is more successful than 
applying pressure. 
  After having resolutely refused to even discuss the 
possibility of the Srpska republic merging with the new 
Muslim-Croat federation, that is, with its enemies, the 
leadership from Pale quickly changed its mind. They decided 
that Serbs should get down to talks and negotiations, because 
the final legalization of the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
still has its good side: It opens the way for the Serbs toward 
the final union with Yugoslavia. However, this story will as 
well be paved with huge stumbling blocks. The U.S. officials 
quickly invented a new trick. They sent the message to Serbs 
that, if they were to keep the entire 70 percent of the 
territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Washington might easily enforce 
the lifting of the arms embargo against the Croats and Muslims. 
As an additional means of pressure, Washington sent Churkin to 
the Srpska republic a couple of times, to make the Serbs even 
more pliable. On the other hand, although the Russian UN 
soldiers were given a euphoric welcome in Pale, Karadzic is more 
than aware that Churkin will not be pursuing exclusively 
pro-Serbian politics, although Moscow has been somewhat better 
disposed to their Orthodox brothers in recent times. With 
obvious interest, and perhaps even surprise, Karadzic listened 
to Momcilo Krajisnik telling him about Churkin's proposal, 
according to which all the peoples in former Yugoslavia should 
join in an association, whereas the association should involve 
various forms of association. 
  Encouraged by what they heard, as Buha puts it, the Bosnian 
Serbs have immediately made clear to Churkin that they cannot 
give up their rights, which have been allowed for the Croats and 
Muslims -- the right to form their state from ethnic cantons, 
and also to enter confederation with Croatia. Because, if the 
Bosnian Croats want a connection with their mother-country, the 
same desires and rights must be observed and allowed to the 
other party, so nobody should oppose these arguments and this 
logic. According to the Pale officials, Churkin has expressed 
his support for this proposal, and if Washington were to do the 
same, then the negotiators would find themselves on the same 
wavelength. 
<H5>  World Against the Unification </H5>
  Still, the international community is more inclined to add 
the Srpska republic to the new federation than to allow its 
union with Yugoslavia. It has been openly stated that Pale will 
be much better off if it sticks to the federal Bosnia. The 
Serbs will cede a percentage of territories under their control, 
otherwise, if they go for a union with Yugoslavia, all of 
Posavina [the Sava River basin] will be taken away from them 
(the Serbs would lose the corridor, while the connection with 
other Serbian countries would be cut), as well as the enclaves 
in eastern Bosnia. However, if the Serbs are flexible enough, 
that is to say, if they join the federation, a corridor 
connecting them with other Serb lands 10 kilometers wide 
(Karadzic demands 50 kilometers) would be given to them, and 
they would also be allowed to keep some predominantly Muslim 
enclaves in eastern Bosnia that are now under their control. 
  It is clear to Karadzic that it is impossible to return all 
the territories in northern and eastern Bosnia to the Croats and 
Muslims, for a simple reason: The land has been devastated and 
the people displaced. It is clear to him that he will have to 
agree to a corridor connecting the Muslim enclaves with the new, 
Vienna-made federation. It is also clear to him that Washington 
and Moscow will first require the Croats and Muslims to 
determine which territories they would accept as final, because 
they cannot have the desired 60 percent, and also that very 
soon, given the mixture of concessions and threats, he will be 
forced into negotiations and further compromises. As for the 
aforementioned adjustment to the general situation, which was 
made possible for Karadzic by a sort of timeout, which also 
included the consultations with Belgrade, a part of that process 
is also the announcement of the forthcoming meeting of the 
assembly of the Srpska republic. As we have discovered, at the 
meeting the possible territorial concessions will be discussed 
again, as well as certain staff changes. Well-informed sources 
claim that those changes apply even to the military top brass 
itself! 
  Whether that will mean that Karadzic has been softened 
enough 
remains to be seen. Besides, it will also become clearer how 
large a piece of Bosnia-Herzegovina the Serbs intend to keep for 
themselves. The only certain thing right now is that they would 
not mind joining the Muslim-Croatian federation (such comments 
were heard after the talks with Churkin), if they could also 
form a kind of confederation with Yugoslavia at the same time.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Gojko Beric: "The Grand Design"] </F>
  [Text] The political and media interpretations of the 
Washington agreement are going through a real turmoil. The 
agreement was initially presented as a triumph of U.S. 
diplomacy, then it was used as confirmation that peace in Bosnia 
was a fait accompli, and in the past few days the affair got an 
unusual epilogue. The majority of analysts now see in the U.S. 
plan for Bosnia a return to the old theme of division of spheres 
of interest, while some even see it as a return to the Cold War. 
The sequence of such different interpretations of one and the 
same fact shows what the capital sum and what the interest rate 
might be in this game. 
  The United States does not have a clear goal in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, because if it had one, it would already have 
achieved it. The events surrounding the Washington agreement 
only confirm the continuity of its inconsistency and 
controversial actions. Clinton has come up with a winning 
combination, yet he is now behaving like a chess player who has 
overlooked an entire chess piece. The chess piece is called 
Russia. That is why the U.S. President is sending Warren 
Christopher to Vladivostok where an agreement on division of 
work in Bosnia should be reached. The West wants the war to end 
so that the two-year public pressure on its governments finally 
stops. On the other hand, correspondents from Moscow report on 
Russia's firm intention of actually reasserting its presence in 
the Balkans through Bosnia. This is not yet proof that history 
is repeating itself, but we should not forget that certain ideas 
often outlive history itself. 
  The Balkan peoples cannot seem to be able to grow up. The 
reason lies both in them and in those who are squabbling over 
them and their countries. For over a hundred years three or 
four superpowers have been regulating affairs in these areas, 
but all of their experiments and creations have failed, and have 
dragged them into catastrophe. It was always others who made 
Bosnia's past tragic, regardless of whether they came from its 
eastern or western borders. Nowadays we are witnessing an 
attempt to end the tragedy caused by the Serbian aggression with 
a plan that has probably never been implemented anywhere. The 
Washington agreement will perhaps bring peace between the Croats 
and the Muslims, but it in itself will not preserve the Bosnian 
state within the existing borders. For Bosnia to survive, 
someone needs to cool the nationalist blood in Belgrade and 
Zagreb. 
  Agreement on certain theoretical principles was reached 
swiftly and easily at the Vienna negotiations about the 
Muslim-Croat federation. This was proclaimed to be a great 
success, and was mathematically expressed with the claim that 
only 5 percent of concurrence was still needed in order for it 
to be a complete triumph. It became evident, however, that 
precisely this "5 percent" represents the essence of things and 
the essence of the conflict. Everything would probably be 
different had this project originated in Bosnia and not in 
Washington. Whenever others had designs on the Bosnians, the 
Bosnians ended up being beheaded. According to this historical 
experience, we must count on the temporary character of this 
latest sartorial model.

  [Excerpt] Political representatives of the Croat people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are making preparations for the forthcoming 
assembly sessions which will determine the future of this 
republic. Zdenko Vranjes reports from Mostar for Croatian Radio: 
  [Vranjes] The leadership of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna and Croat deputies are carrying out preparations 
for two forthcoming sessions -- important sessions indeed -- of 
the chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna 
scheduled for Saturday and the historic constitutional 
[ustavotvoran] assembly of federal Bosnia-Herzegovina which is 
expected to take place in Sarajevo on Monday and Tuesday. 
Kresimir Zubak [president of the presidential council of 
Herceg-Bosna] has told Croatian Radio the following: 
  [begin recording] [Zubak] [words indistinct] this session of 
the constitutional assembly scheduled for Monday 28 March. We 
have scheduled, prior to this, a session of the chamber of 
deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna at which we 
should inform the deputies about the documents we adopted in 
Washington and prepared in Vienna. 
  All deputies to the chamber of deputies of the Croat 
republic 
of Herceg-Bosna are also deputies to the constitutional 
assembly. This assembly of Herceg-Bosna is going to formulate 
final standpoints and instruct the deputies at the session of 
the constitutional assembly on Monday and Tuesday. 
  [Vranjes] Will all the deputies from the ranks of the Croat 
people take part in the constitutional assembly in Sarajevo on 
Monday? Has this been prepared and agreed yet? 
  [Zubak] All technical details relating to this have not been 
agreed yet. I believe that today or tomorrow we will agree on 
every technical detail. We are of the opinion that all the 
deputies from the ranks of the Croat people who were deputies to 
the former assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be present and 
vote. It is a known fact that a constitution may be adopted by 
a consensus of two peoples. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Zvornik, March 23 (TANJUG) -- A convoy of the U.N. 
High Commessariat for Refugees (UNHCR) on Wednesday crossed the 
territory of the Bosnian Serb republic (RS) on its way for 
Moslem-held Tuzla, northeast Bosnia, Bosnian Serb military 
sources in Zvornik said. 
  The 13 truck convoy was carrying 104 tonnes of flour. 
  Another relief aid convoy was also scheduled to leave for 
Tuzla, but the UNHCR team failed to return from a previous 
humanitarian mission, the Zvornik authorities were told. 
  Bosnian Serb military sources said that the fact that since 
their very start the humanitarian land convoys for Tuzla have 
crossed Bosnian Serb territory safely and unhindered, gives rise 
for doubts in the humanitarian reasons for the opening of the 
Tuzla airport. 
  The sources said that the land routes enable the efficient 
ferrying of much bigger quantities of relif aid to Tuzla than 
via the air bridge.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus by Ivo Slavik </F>
in Bratislava on 16 March: "The Third Way Is a Chimera"] 
  [Text] [Slavik] What kind of economic policies does your 
government intend to give priority to? 
  [Filkus] We need to swiftly stabilize the macrosphere. We 
have to abandon the idea that there is a third way toward the 
market. We have slowed down privatization in Slovakia by our 
speculations about a third way. Because we have already taken 
steps associated with a restrictive macroeconomic policy of a 
budgetary and monetary character, we cannot fall back. We have 
to continue to liberalize prices and to maintain our currency's 
internal convertibility. It is also necessary to speed up and 
depoliticize privatization, mainly because it was used as a 
means of concentrating political power. We have to prepare the 
second wave of coupon privatization by fall, at the latest. The 
economic microsphere appears to be the most risky area. The 
enterprises are surviving on their equity and not from the fact 
that they are efficient. The necessary changes are again 
associated with speeding up privatization. 
  We will try to establish and develop the, to date, small 
capital market. That is, we should improve the microsphere by 
means of the capital market. Of course, there are also 
matter-of-fact problems that can be resolved by restructuring, 
but not the kind that would be undertaken by the center. The 
microsphere must also be supported, to a substantial degree, by 
the influx of foreign capital. 
  [Slavik] Was the recently introduced import surcharge really 
necessary? 
  [Filkus] This is a normal instrument of a market economy. 
It is intended to protect the domestic market. The market left 
open, however, should be filled by domestic products. Other 
systemic measures also have to be put into effect for this, 
though. If they are not put into effect, the consumer would pay 
more and more for goods, regardless of the surcharge. 
  [Slavik] There are rumors about state property being looted 
by the previous government. Is this true? 
  [Filkus] Many privatization projects were approved with 
unusual speed during the past three government sessions. 
  [Slavik] According to some deputies, they were on the verge 
of legality. Is the successor government going to investigate 
them? 
  [Filkus] Yes. Such a proposal has already been made in 
parliament. Before we address the citizens, we have to take 
inventory and tell them under what conditions we are taking over 
the economy. 
  [Slavik] Could the split within the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] continue? 
  [Filkus] Everything suggests that the process of dissolution 
is continuing. It was recently announced that the leadership of 
the HZDS Deputies' Club is again being changed. 
  [Slavik] Do you think Vladimir Meciar will win again in the 
early elections? 
  [Filkus] No. I am convinced of this. 
  [Slavik] What do you think of the reactions by the police 
following the assault on certain journalists by demonstrators? 
  [Filkus] I condemn them. If this was intended as a test of 
the police officers and their commanders, it was a complete 
failure.

<F P=106> [Aarticle by Arteria-REPUBLIKA-mad: "We Are Going To Be </F>
Ltd."] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Dusan Kleiman, director general of the 
Press Agency of the Slovak Republic [TA SR] confirmed to the 
ARTERIA-STA [Slovak Press Agency] that the REPUBLIKA daily is in 
debt and, by extension, the TA SR is in debt to Danubiaprint. 
He refused to specify the size of the debt. According to our 
source, however, who does not wish to be named but comes 
directly from the TA SR, this debt exceeds 18 million korunas. 
He says that the debt exists because the daily has not used any 
funds from the government subsidy for its operation. "Everybody 
reproaches us for publishing REPUBLIKA for government money, but 
it has financed itself," he emphasized. So far, however, 
circulation has not been large enough, he says, to cover all of 
the expenditure. 
  As Kleiman also said, the TA SR management reached an 
agreement with certain entities to pay all of the outstanding 
debts by surrendering the REPUBLIKA banner and all concomitant 
rights. "They are prominent entities, with a certain political 
position on the Slovak political scene," he said. He 
categorically refused the idea that state treasury funds would 
be used to pay the debt. According to Jan Comaj, deputy chief 
editor of REPUBLIKA, the new publisher of the daily will be 
REPUBLIKA Ltd. 
  Dusan Kleiman said that REPUBLIKA, which was supposed to be 
a 
news-oriented daily, has gradually become an opinion-forming 
popular daily, and, thereby, it transgressed the publisher's 
original concept. "We meant to make it into a newspaper version 
of CNN, but it ended the way it did," the TA SR director said.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Slovak and Czech newspapers on 19 and 
21 March publish a number of items dealing with the "political 
background" to recent "purges" in the management of the East 
Slovak Ironworks [VSZ], Slovakia's largest company, and the 
suspicious circumstances of the sale of a major package of VSZ 
shares by Vladimir Meciar's Cabinet shortly before it was 
dismissed on 14 March. According to a report in Bratislava 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak on 14 March on page 5, VSZ is "the 
flagship of Slovak industry," which employs 27,000 people, 
exports 80 percent of its annual turnover of over $1 billion, 
and generates 25 percent of Slovakia's hard-currency earnings. 
  Prague DENNI TELEGRAF in Czech on 21 March on page 5 carries 
a 1,000-word article by Peter Schutz, the newspaper's Kosice 
correspondent, entitled "Privatization in the Style of Vladimir 
Meciar: I Scratch Your Back, You Scratch Mine." The article 
deals with the decision made by the Slovak Government on 11 
March at night, a few hours after the Slovak parliament passed 
the vote of no-confidence in Vladimir Meciar, to sell 1.5 
million VSZ shares, 9.52 percent of the total, to "VSZ Manager 
Ltd.," a company established by the ironworks' recently 
installed new management. According to Schutz, the package has 
been sold for 200 Slovak korunas [Sk] per share, although the 
shares' nominal value is Sk1,000 and their market value (that 
is, the price at which they are currently being traded on the 
Bratislava Stock Exchange) Sk500. 
  Commenting on the decision, Schutz says: "What is involved 
is 
a transparent and simple `I scratch your back, you scratch mine' 
system. VSZ Manager Ltd. was entered in the company register at 
a municipal district court in Kosice on Friday, 11 March--that 
is, on the day when the no-confidence vote in the government was 
passed. The decision on the transaction was made Friday night. 
The most interesting thing about the transaction is that 
participants in VSZ Manager Ltd., whose capital stock is 
Sk100,000, are five members of the VSZ Board of Directors, who 
had been installed in their posts by a decision of the National 
Property Fund [FNM] Supervisory Board at the end of December 
1993. The FNM Supervisory Board was chaired at that time by 
Finance Minister Julius Toth." As Schutz goes on to say, while 
it was chaired by Julius Toth, the FNM Supervisory Board also 
convened an extraordinary general meeting of VSZ shareholders. 
This meeting, which was held on 17 March, elected Julius Toth to 
be chairman of the VSZ Supervisory Board. "But this is not all," 
Schutz says in conclusion: "The entire transaction was made 
possible by Banka Slovakia, whose capital is covered fully by 
FNM property, in the form of a credit extended to Priemyselna 
Banka [Industrial Bank] in Kosice. Priemyselna Banka promptly 
granted a loan to VSZ Manager Ltd. so that it could pay the 
first 15 percent installment. It will no longer come as a 
surprise that, on Thursday [17 March], Julius Toth was elected 
deputy chairman of the Priemyselna Banka Board of Directors." 
  Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 19 March on page 1 
carries a 600-word interview with Zsolt Komlosi, a member of the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] Privatization 
Committee, by Alena Gottweisova, entitled "The FNM Damaged 
Itself." In the interview, the place and date of which are not 
given, Komlosi discusses the circumstances of the sale of 9.53 
percent of VSZ shares to five members of the VSZ top management. 
Komlosi confirms that the transaction was made possible by a 
loan provided by Banka Slovakia, whose financial resources come 
from the FNM, to Priemyselna Banka in Kosice, which, in turn, 
lent the money to the five members of the VSZ management. He 
also confirms that Priemyselna Banka "is linked to the former 
minister of finance." According to Komlosi, through this 
transaction, the FNM "caused itself damage of Sk1 billion," 
which is the difference between the price at which the VSZ 
shares were sold to the managers and the price they would fetch 
on the stock exchange. 
  Komlosi also points out that the capital stock of VSZ 
Manager 
Ltd. represents only Sk100,000 (with each of the five partners 
contributing Sk20,000) and wonders "how a limited liability 
company that is accountable for sums up to Sk100,000 can realize 
in only five days a transaction through which it acquires Sk1 
billion or property to this value." He announces that, on 
Tuesday, 22 March, the NRSR Privatization Committee "will start 
reexamining the documentation of privatization projects at the 
FNM." 
  Bratislava SME in Slovak on 21 March on pages 1 and 2 
carries 
a 1,300-word "eb"-signed report entitled "Purges in VSZ, but Not 
Only in VSZ, Had a Political Background." The report cites a 
statement issued by four former members of the VSZ Board of 
Directors--Zoltan Berghauer, Dionyz Kunder, Stanislav Polak, and 
Marian Sarissky--who were dismissed in December 1993. In the 
statement, the four managers explain their decision to lodge a 
complaint against what they regard as their "unlawful 
dismissal." The complaint was lodged with the Kosice Regional 
Court on 17 March. The four managers' statement is also the 
subject of a 1,000-word "er"-signed report entitled "What Was 
Going On Behind the Metallurgical Curtain," in Bratislava PRAVDA 
in Slovak on 21 March on pages 1 and 2. 
  In the first part of their statement, the four managers 
discuss the economic results achieved by the VSZ under their 
management. They point out that, even though the company set 
aside Sk800 million as a "strategic reserve" and Sk124 million 
as a "bad debt reserve" in 1993, it exceeded the projected 
pretax profit for that year by 26 percent. They note that the 
value of VSZ assets went up from Sk32 to Sk46.8 billion, that 
the price of VSZ shares increased by 240 percent, that the 
number of VSZ employees did not decline, despite the high 
average monthly wages of Sk9,500, and that a dividend was 
expected to be paid to shareholders. Therefore, they express 
their conviction that "the personnel purges" of December 1993 
did not have economic motives but "a political background." 
  The managers' statement goes on to say that, shortly after 
the Kosice mayoral elections in the fall of 1992, in which the 
candidate of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] did 
not win, "our former colleague Julius Toth, who was then 
minister of finance, conveyed to us the great dissatisfaction of 
the HZDS's leading representatives with the VSZ management" and 
"reproached the VSZ top management for having done little or 
nothing for the HZDS candidate to get elected." Toth's 
criticism reportedly culminated in the proposal that Zoltan 
Berghauer, then chairman of the VSZ Board of Directors, dismiss 
Marian Sarissky and Dionyz Kunder from the Board of Directors 
"because Sarissky had signed a statement of the Forum of Slovak 
Intelligentsia and Kunder was a sympathizer of the Christian 
Democratic Movement." According to the four managers' 
statement, Berghauer "rejected Toth's demands as unfounded and 
unprecedented." In conclusion, the managers say: "We suppose 
that this rejection prompted Julius Toth to seek other forms and 
instruments to bring about changes in the VSZ Board of 
Directors, which he implemented through certain members of the 
VSZ Supervisory Board and the FNM. Not just two, but four 
members of the Board of Directors were recalled in this way, 
this time without citing any reasons or objections."

  [Editorial Report] Bratislava SME in Slovak on 22 March 
publishes articles on personnel changes in the National Property 
Fund of the Slovak Republic (FNM SR) and on the first steps 
taken by the new leadership. 
  Bratislava SME in Slovak on 22 March on page 1 carries a 
400-word "asa"-signed report entitled "M. Knit: I Expect Changes 
in the FNM Presidium and Executive Committee." The report notes 
that "on Friday, 18 March, the FNM SR Presidium withdrew from 
Jan Kato the authorization to hold the post of chairman of the 
FNM SR Executive Committee. It charged Karol Danys, a member of 
the FNM Executive Committee, with the provisional management of 
the FNM Executive Committee." The report then quotes M. Knitl, 
a member of the FNM Presidium, as having told SME that "he 
expects parliament to devote itself in the very near future to 
the election of new members of the FNM Presidium and assumes 
that changes in the FNM Executive Committee will follow suit." 
Asked whether he believes that "political criteria prevailed 
over professional criteria in the election of current members of 
the FNM Executive Committee," Knitl concedes that "in some 
cases, the two criteria were not in conformity." Confronted 
with "claims casting doubt on some privatization projects" that 
were approved by Vladimir Meciar's Cabinet shortly before its 
dismissal, Knitl says that "the FNM has been only the 
implementor of government resolutions" and can be made 
responsible only for the technical realization of projects. 
  On the same page, Bratislava SME in Slovak carries a 
100-word 
interview with Karol Danys, "a member of the FNM SR Executive 
Committee charged with its management," by an "asa"-attributed 
SME reporter. The interview, the place and date of which are 
not given, is published under the headline "We Have Agreed To 
Freeze FNM Accounts." In the interview, Danys announces that 
"we have agreed with the minister of privatization to ban 
trading in FNM securities and to freeze its accounts. To 
prevent the situation regarding privatization, around which 
there is plenty of confusion, from deteriorating, we have agreed 
to halt all property transfers."

Modernized Tank Turret"] 
  [Text] Dubnica nad Vahom--The ZTS [Zavody Tazkeho 
Strojarstva, Heavy Engineering Works] Dubnica state enterprise 
is preparing the production of a modernized turret for tanks of 
the T-72 type. The production should be launched this year. In 
this context, it is also advancing the offer of cooperation to 
the RDP [Research, Development, Production] Group, the 
association of Czech arms manufacturers. This transpired from 
an interview given by Peter Koncier, director of ZTS Dubnica nad 
Vahom, to a CTK correspondent yesterday. According to 
information provided by Koncier, ZTS Dubnica expects an overall 
increase of its special production this year. The increase will 
be secured by the production of a trial run of the 155-mm 
howitzer code-named "Zuzana," which conforms to NATO 
specifications. It will come, in part, also from the expected 
growth in sales of spare parts and from the modernized tank 
turret. The modernization of the tank turret, which has been 
virtually completed, concerns the control systems, the 
night-vision system, the firing-control system, and the like, 
Koncier said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Seges, director of the Criminal Law </F>
Department at the General Prosecutor's Office of the Slovak 
Republic, by Juraj Handzo; place and date not given: "Will We Be 
Able To Cope With Mafias?; Law on Combating Organized Crime 
Being Drafted"] 
  [Text] A few days ago, the government's Legislative 
Council approved with comments the draft of a law on uncovering 
and punishing the most serious, especially organized, forms of 
crime. The draft has been prepared by the General Prosecutor's 
Office of the Slovak Republic. We discussed the purpose and the 
contents of the new law with one of its authors, Ivan Seges, 
LL.D., director of the Criminal Law Department at the General 
Prosecutor's Office of the Slovak Republic. 
  [Handzo] Could you briefly characterize the contents of the 
law under preparation? 
  [Seges] In drafting the law, we strove to have it contain, 
on the greatest scale possible, such elements as would make it 
possible to vigorously crack down on manifestations of organized 
crime. The draft consists, in fact, of two parts. The first 
concerns legal means that make it possible to uncover attempts 
at an unlawful legalization of income stemming from serious 
criminal activity--that is, the so-called laundering of dirty 
money. The second part defines legal means and procedures that 
would make it possible to expose and document serious criminal 
activity in a way that could be used as evidence in court [s 
procesnou posobnostou]. The course of action by the bodies 
involved in criminal proceedings has until now been formal, in a 
certain way, so that findings by the criminal police that were 
not obtained by the set procedures could not be used as evidence 
in court. 
  [Handzo] What is the purpose of the proposed legal means? 
  [Seges] We would like to break through the principle that is 
valid now, according to which it is possible to start collecting 
evidence, for it to be recognized in court, only after criminal 
prosecution has been formally initiated. In the case of listed 
criminal acts (which are enumerated in the draft law), the 
bodies involved in criminal proceedings should be permitted to 
collect evidence that will be recognized in court before the 
initiation of criminal prosecution. These bodies should be 
endowed with such powers as would allow them to investigate 
effectively, in a way that will be recognized in court, when 
their crime-solving experience and other indications suggest 
that they are confronted with organized crime, even if they do 
not avail themselves of findings signaling a specific criminal 
act. 
  [Handzo] Could the application of legal means permitting the 
start of investigations in the event of a mere suspicion not 
constitute encroachment upon basic human rights in certain cases? 
  [Seges] The draft law makes it possible for bodies involved 
in criminal proceedings to secure evidence, in the case of 
listed (enumerated) criminal acts, without there being a formal 
resolution on the initiation of criminal prosecution. 
Therefore, should a charge be raised, the effects of the start 
of criminal prosecution would retroactively authorize even the 
deployment of operational technical devices 
[operativno-technickych prostriedkov], telephone tapping, or the 
use of a secret agent operating under an assumed identity 
(alias), who would penetrate into the criminal environment with 
the aim of obtaining evidence. 
  It is self-evident that, in view of this being a very 
serious 
encroachment upon citizens' civil rights and liberties, all of 
these means could be used only with the consent of the judge or 
prosecutor. Opponents of this regulation argue that it is 
anticonstitutional or that it restricts basic human rights. 
However, the Constitution expressly states that these rights 
can be restricted by law if the interest of society so requires. 
And it is in the interest of society that the relevant bodies 
be provided with the possibility to crack down effectively on 
organized crime. No one is going to restrict the rights of 
decent people.... 
  [Handzo] The specific criminal acts authorizing the 
application of the aforesaid legal means are listed in the draft 
law. Which criminal acts are involved? 
  [Seges] This would apply, for example, to the criminal acts 
of terrorism, sabotage, counterfeiting and altering money and 
securities, general endangerment, endangering the safety of an 
aircraft or a civilian vessel, unauthorized armament, and other 
grievous criminal acts. Apart from this, we propose a provision 
under which, in certain cases and with the prosecutor's consent, 
the law would also apply to deliberate criminal acts, for which 
the minimum sentence is five years of deprivation of freedom, 
provided the circumstances of the case justify the assumption 
that the act had been committed by an organized group, as 
defined by this law. 
  [Handzo] Let us return to the issue of "dirty-money 
laundering." What will the adoption of the law mean in 
practice, from that point of view? 
  [Seges] The draft provides for several basic principles, the 
application of which would help expose attempts at the unlawful 
legalization of income stemming from serious criminal activity. 
First of all, it lays down the obligation for juridical persons 
and entrepreneurs to report facts suggesting the existence of 
such activities. At the same time, the anonymity in relation to 
financial institutions should be eliminated in a certain way, to 
make it possible to identify people carrying out suspicious 
banking operations. Financial institutions should be placed 
under the obligation to report to the Prosecutor's Office or to 
the Slovak Republic Police Corps not only instances of suspected 
legalization of income stemming from organized criminal activity 
but also cash deposits and withdrawals exceeding a certain sum 
(for example, 100,000 Slovak korunas). The second principle is 
that juridical persons and entrepreneurs are obliged to refuse 
to perform acts (such as the conclusion of a contract) that 
could, without doubt, be conducive to the legalization of income 
stemming from serious criminal activity. Furthermore, the draft 
law sets out the right, in the event of any suspicious 
transactions, to ascertain the origin of the property that these 
transactions concern. The last proposed provision is that a 
citizen or an organization that helps uncover attempts at the 
legalization of income stemming from organized criminal activity 
is entitled to a reward in the amount of 10 percent of the 
uncovered sum. Naturally, all of these provisions would be 
applied also to machinations associated with the privatization 
process. 
  [Handzo] Does the draft law also provide for manifestations 
of organized crime associated with the criminal act of the 
unauthorized production and possession of narcotic and 
psychotropic substances and toxins--that is, drug-trafficking? 
  [Seges] As we know, existing legislation did not make it 
possible, in fact, to combat more effectively these expressions 
of organized crime. If a person was found to carry such a 
substance and wanted to avoid criminal prosecution, often this 
person only had to say that it was for his or her own need. The 
draft law contains provisions under which it would be possible 
to prosecute criminally everyone possessing these substances, 
regardless of whether he keeps them for his own needs or for 
someone else. Of course, it is up to the relevant specialized 
bodies to assess in each specific case, considering the quantity 
of the seized addictive substance, whether the person in 
question could keep it for his or her own use. 
  [Handzo] What makes the struggle against organized crime 
exceptionally difficult is the inadequate protection of 
witnesses. Does the proposed law provide for any changes in this 
regard? 
  [Seges] The provision of essential protection to witnesses 
is one of the pillars of the draft we propose. Intimidation of 
potential witnesses is one of the common practices of organized 
crime. The protection of witnesses should be secured in three 
ways. First, under strictly defined conditions, the law will 
make it possible for them to remain anonymous; second, on the 
basis of a provision in the law, it will be possible to question 
them during court proceedings with the public excluded; and, 
finally, when agents are concerned, their true identity will not 
be revealed even during criminal proceedings.

  [Text] Of all of the new Cabinet ministers, Defense 
Minister Pavel Kanis is so far the most active on the 
international scene. He was on a lightning visit to Hungary on 
Monday [21 March], and this morning he left for a scheduled 
visit to Israel. 
  This country, which was not accessible to us until recently, 
is becoming an interesting partner for Slovakia. Besides 
economic cooperation, we are also interested in cooperation in 
the military sphere. Our editor Jan Baranek interviewed Defense 
Minister Kanis before his departure. 
  [Begin recording] [Baranek] Minister, you will be leaving 
for 
Israel in a few hours. What will be the main themes of your 
talks with the Israeli partner? 
  [Kanis] This visit has been under preparation for a fairly 
long time. I was thinking whether it would serve any purpose to 
go on this visit so soon after taking office. After 
consultations, my colleagues and I gained the impression that 
the visit was well prepared and that we should go because these 
relations with Israel are interesting and important to us. 
  The objective of the visit will be, first of all, an 
exchange 
of experience in the field of the arms industry and arms 
systems. We are small countries that can complement each other 
in some areas of this type of production. Meetings with the 
prime minister and the foreign minister are scheduled, and, 
therefore, foreign policy issues and the international situation 
will also be on the agenda. 
  I will be accompanied by several people from the economic 
sector and from Slovak arms factories. I assume that they and 
their partners will discuss the opportunities for cooperation or 
for trade. 
  [Baranek] What will be the Slovak delegations's stance on 
the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Would you like to link it to the 
policy of the former Czech and Slovak Federal Republic? 
  [Kanis] Probably not. Our opinion on Israeli-Arab relations 
is guided by the relevant UN resolutions, including the latest 
resolution made on the issue. I think our country is far away 
from this territory, and, therefore, we have to keep a certain 
overview of Israeli-Arab relations. In my opinion, Slovakia's 
foreign policy on this conflict and on these relations is well 
balanced and meets the preconditions and the criterion of a 
certain overview on the matter. [end recording]

  [Text] In Prague today, Belgian Vice Prime Minister and 
Foreign Minister Willy Claes, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, 
and Foreign Minister Jozef Zieleniec discussed relations between 
the Czech Republic and the Kingdom of Belgium. Mutual 
multilateral relations in connection with the Czech Republic's 
effort aimed at joining the European Union were also discussed. 
Klara Stejskalova reports: 
  [Stejskalova] All of the representatives jointly praised the 
good and intensive relations between the two countries, evidence 
of which is the unusual interest of Belgian entrepreneurs in our 
country, Josef Zieleniec said. Over the past year alone, the 
Belgians have invested more than $150 million in our country. 
Thus, they rank fourth among foreign investors. 
  Regarding Czech membership in the European Union, Claes 
expressed complete support for the Czech Republic. At the same 
time, he praised the democratization of politics in our country 
and the path toward a very strong economy that we have embarked 
upon. In conclusion, he said that those West Europeans who 
think they live on an isolated island are naive. He said that 
support for the process of integration is in the interest of the 
European Union. Integration should take place gradually and not 
in blocks. It should be based solely on the fulfillment of the 
necessary conditions by individual countries. It cannot be 
expected, however, that European Union enlargement could take 
place before the intergovernmental conference of the European 
Union states, scheduled to take place in 1996.

Free Europe [RFE], agree to U.S. businessman George Soros's 
investing millions of dollars in the station, negotiations with 
the Czech Government about the RFE's relocation to the building 
of the former Federal Assembly in Prague would be seriously 
jeopardized. This was declared by Minister [of Control] Igor 
Nemec yesterday. 
  THE NEW YORK TIMES wrote on Sunday [20 March] that the RFE 
was expected to reach an agreement with Soros within one month 
about the privatization of its research center and archives and 
their relocation from Munich to Prague. 
  The government is determined to finance the operation of the 
currently unoccupied building of the Federal Assembly until the 
end of this month. Should RFE move into the building, it ought 
to finance the operation of the building as of April. The 
building is to be leased to it for only a symbolic sum. Should 
Soros become involved in the radio as an investor, however, the 
Czech Government would have no reason, according to Nemec, not 
to lease the Federal Assembly building to someone else at a 
market price. "There are hundreds of interested parties," Nemec 
said.

<F P=106> [Czech Statistical Office report: "Consumer Prices and Cost </F>
of Living in February"] 
  [Text] Consumer prices rose in February, in comparison 
with January, by only 0.2 percent. This was caused by the 
moderate decline in prices of food (0.2 percent) and a marginal 
price increase in the other groups, which amounted to 0.3 
percent in public catering and in both nonfood items and 
services equal to 0.4 percent. 
  The moderate decline in food prices was caused, above all, 
by 
the decline of prices of meat and meat products (by 1.3 percent) 
and eggs (by 16.9 percent). The largest increase was registered 
in the price of coffee (4.2 percent) and beverages (0.7 
percent). In public catering, the prices of restaurant catering 
rose by only 0.1 percent, while company food services went up 
1.2 percent. Only a moderate increase was registered in the 
prices of nonfood items, and that in practically all groups of 
goods--prices of footwear and leather haberdashery rose most 
(0.9 percent), followed by household appliances (0.8 percent). 
Fuel prices remained at the level of January 1994, and tobacco 
prices declined by 0.2 percent. In services, prices of water and 
sewage rose most of all (7.0 percent), followed by garbage 
removal (4.7 percent). 
  Over the first two months of the year (February in 
comparison 
with December 1993), the prices rose overall by 2.1 percent, of 
which services increased most (8.4 percent--the result of the 
increased rents, heating, and hot water in January), while the 
prices of nonfood items rose substantially less, as did public 
catering (1.4 and 1.1 percent, respectively). The prices of 
food remained at the level of December 1993. 
  The prorated annual rate of inflation (the average for the 
past 12 months in comparison with the 12 preceding months) 
amounted to 18.7 percent in February. 
  In connection with the consumer price development, the 
household expenditures of white-color workers rose in 
February--from January--by 0.2 percent, and expenditures of 
farmers by 0.3 percent. Because of the largest share of food in 
the overall household expenditures of pensioners, their cost of 
living did not change in February (in comparison with January 
1994).

  [Text] We have asked the Slovene Defense Minister [Janez 
Jansa] to give an opinion about the case. From a longer 
interview that we broadcast less than an hour ago, here is an 
excerpt: 
  [Begin Jansa recording] This matter is not as one-sided as 
it appears at first sight. Regarding the opinion of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, one must wait to hear the other 
side of the story about the work of this ministry. However, 
there are few things that are definitely questionable in this 
process and I could express my regret in advance. 
  Today, yesterday, and indeed ever since the event took 
place, there has been an internal investigation in our ministry; 
that is, a chronological reconstruction of this event. I have 
the initial draft of this reconstruction here and it is 
perfectly clear to me now, minute by minute, how the events 
unfolded. There are some important new facts here. 
  Let me begin with those things that might be questionable. 
The inquiry will definitely have to determine whether the force 
used when the car was broken into and so forth was justified. 
The inquiry will also have to explain about the time that 
elapsed between the arrest of Mr. Smolnikar and when the 
information-communications center of the Ljubljana-City Interior 
Ministry was informed. I must say, however, that the whole 
affair is not as it was presented yesterday: The police were 
informed about the detention of this man, who refused to reveal 
any personal data and, therefore, refused to identify himself, 
having been arrested receiving certain documents from a military 
person, and they were asked to take him to a physician, as he 
had demanded, at 2045. The arrest itself took place at 2020. 
Therefore, only the time when the man was brought to the 
Security Headquarters of the Defense Ministry is controversial 
here. 
  As I have already said, no procedures were initiated against 
this man; that is to say, he was not questioned, as he would not 
even identify himself. He was informed of his rights under 
Article 50-A of the Internal Affairs Law. The man, in 
accordance with these rights, demanded to be examined by a 
physician and requested the presence of a lawyer, which were 
both complied with. During this time, according to the data 
from where this event took place, an approximate identification 
of the man was made; namely, what we knew in advance was 
confirmed, even though he did not reveal any information about 
himself. Immediately afterward we tried to hand him over to the 
civilian police. 
  Although we requested this twice, it did not happen and that 
is the only reason why it was the military police who 
transported him to the physician. [end recording] 
  Minister Jansa in an interview to our reporter Sandi Frelih 
expressed regret over the unfortunate event and gave assurances 
that Mr. Smolnikar was not viciously beaten but merely sustained 
light injuries in the course of resisting arrest. He said that 
the events imply the involvement of other state bodies and have 
a political background.

  [Excerpt] Regarding claims and media reports about the 
Smolnikar case, the Ministry of Internal Affairs called a news 
conference today at which it refuted the defense minister's 
claims that the police did not want to take Milan Smolnikar into 
custody. The Ministry also shed light on some cases in which 
the investigation against Defense Ministry employees came to a 
halt precisely because of the blockade by the Defense Ministry. 
Gojko Bervar reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Bervar] Minister Bizjak, Mitja Klavora, 
the head of the Criminal Police, and State Secretary Borut Likar 
first armed themselves with a tape of the first contact between 
the Defense Ministry and the operational communication center of 
the interior minister in the Smolnikar case. From the tape, one 
really cannot conclude that it implies rejection. On the 
contrary, the Ministry of Internal Affairs constantly tried to 
convince the representatives of the Defense Ministry to take 
Smolnikar to a police station in Domzale. However, further 
discussion proved that, at the time of the contact, the members 
of VOMO [Defense Ministry Security Organ] already had Smolnikar 
in Kardeljeva Street in Ljubljana [VOMO headquarters] and that 
they were calling the police, I quote, to avoid a fuss. [no 
reference to close of quotation as heard] 
  Mr. Gasper, as a representative of the Defense Ministry 
identified himself, even said: 
  [Gasper] The thing is that we should have questioned him a 
little more. 
  [Bervar] At the news conference Minister Bizjak said that 
this was not the first case in connection with Defense Ministry 
employees. In all these cases, ranging from the suspicion of 
arms trafficking, some [word indistinct] thefts, suspected 
embezzlement in Orbis enterprise [manufacturing submachine guns] 
and even in the well-known cases of the public letter by the 
Civilian Initiative and the explosives placed under the car of 
Member of Parliament Jelincic -- in all these cases the 
investigation came to a halt because of the lack of 
cooperativeness and, in some cases, the prevention of further 
investigation on the part of the Defense Ministry. 
  The Interior Ministry first warned the prime minister about 
all this at the end of last year. They also drafted a special 
report that, in its conclusion, points at (?ambiguities) in the 
legislation; however, a meeting that would clarifying everything 
did not materialize, also because the acting VOMO director 
assured Mitja Klavora that he does not have any such 
instructions from the defense minister. 
  Ivo Bizjak also dismissed the possibility that any sort of 
subversive organization would be active within the Ministry and 
said that there is not the slightest proof for this. Milan 
Smolnikar is not an employee of the Interior Ministry and all 
hitherto investigations by the police were within the boundaries 
of legal procedures, they said at the news conference. 
  However, they have established the activity of a group of 
people within the Defense Ministry, consisting of various 
organizational units of this Ministry, which, besides illegally 
prescribed tasks on the field, also engages in special tasks 
that are not the responsibility of this Ministry, some of them 
precisely in Ljubljana. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] The balance of power in parliament is such that an 
interpellation is possible. It has been anticipated for a long 
time, and there is good reason for it. However, it will not be 
the arguments that will decide on this. This is how Defense 
Minister Janez Jansa assessed the rumors about an interpellation 
over the Smolnikar case. We can agree with everything except 
the minister's last statement. 
  In an interview with our radio station he himself admitted 
that the preliminary results of the internal investigation have 
shown that some things are controversial, namely the 
justification of the use of force and incursion into a personal 
vehicle by camouflaged special brigade soldiers, and the time 
that elapsed between the detention of a civilian, his 
transportation to the ministry, and the police being informed. 
  However, the essence of the problem lies elsewhere: in the 
army's interference in the civilian sphere and the understanding 
of a rule-of-law state, regardless of what the civilian in 
question might have done. This is another story to which there 
will be an epilogue, if the accusations are true. 
  According to information so far, there is no justification 
for the behavior of the Interior Ministry members. The minister 
himself made the biggest mistake here because he did not take 
steps against his subordinates by at least temporarily 
suspending them until the completion of the inquiry, 
particularly since this was not the first excess of this type 
and it puts the entire army in a bad light. 
  Had we lived in a normal country, he himself would have 
submitted his resignation and everybody would have viewed this 
as an honorable act. At the end of the day, the government 
might even have fallen because of Sunday's events. However, in 
the heated political atmosphere with political clashes and 
meetings constantly in the air, along with all sorts of mutual 
suspicions, imputations, and tactical games, one cannot hope for 
a rational approach. A normal political struggle has in 
Slovenia transformed itself into a battle for new and final 
victories. Everybody has now left the decision to the prime 
minister.

<F P=106> [Boris Jez commentary: "The King Is Naked, Where Is the </F>
Happy End?"] 
  [Text] There is no doubt that the president of the state 
[Milan Kucan] "was taught a lesson" at the Monday session of the 
prime minister's political coordinating group. He spoke of 
illegal structures, quasi-intelligence services, 
disqualifications, and physical liquidations in Nova Gorica -- 
and now the government's leadership publicly tells him that, on 
the basis of the verified information, there is no proof for his 
claims. Therefore, the president is speaking without any basis, 
which in a normal democracy would already be enough to make one 
think. 
  The political coordinating group is a term from the past, 
but 
one cannot deny the competence of the team that met on Monday. 
In addition to the main ministers, the chiefs of both (legal) 
intelligence services were also present there, and who could 
judge about the state and its security matters more 
authoritatively! If this "security leadership" therefore agreed 
on all the most important issues, it would be difficult to 
object, and even more difficult to say that president's opinion 
is more "authoritative." Kucan thus remained isolated with his 
claims. This cannot be eased even by the fact that his main 
opponent, the defense minister [Janez Jansa], attended the 
Monday meeting. It was almost certainly the prime minister 
[Janez Drnovsek] who decided about "the outcome" of the meeting 
and who approved the final version of the statement. 
  Knowing Drnovsek well, along with his skill and tact when it 
comes to current dilemmas, last Monday could not qualify as one 
of Jansa's triumphant days. The prime minister could not 
"establish" that illegal secret services are rummaging around 
Slovenia and that the country is facing its disintegration; that 
is why the wording in the statement appears to be to the liking 
of Janez Jansa, but it was not necessarily put on the paper in 
this form because of him and his interests. 
  The fact that the defense minister cannot celebrate victory 
does not mean, however, that Kucan did not suffer (at least) a 
temporary defeat. In a way this was also confirmed by a letter 
that he addressed to the prime minister on the very same day and 
in which he allegedly again warned him of some of his meetings 
with senior police officers and the SOVA [the Slovene 
Information-Security Agency]. It was supposedly precisely these 
people who told him about the organized groups that engage 
unlawfully in intelligence activities and exceed their 
authority, all to the possible detriment of security. Kucan's 
letter in itself reflects the highly unfavorable position in 
which he has found himself: Not only that he has been saying 
things in Nova Gorica that "the security leadership" 
subsequently coolly denied, but the senior state officials 
misinform him! Perhaps they are even doing this deliberately. 
How could one otherwise interpret the fact that they 
subsequently attended a meeting with the prime minister at which 
they concluded that the activity of which the president spoke 
did not take place! Or have they changed sides in the meantime?! 
  If Kucan wishes to retain authority, it probably will not be 
very good for him to tackle such and similar issues in front of 
the public tribunal -- although he will, on the other hand, be 
forced to explain to this tribunal what he meant by everything 
he said in Nova Gorica. In other words, the Monday "ruling" of 
the political coordinating group literally stripped the 
president naked before the public; he will now find it hard to 
explain what sort of clothes he actually has. 
  The people can merely observe this mysterious political 
supergame -- which appears increasingly less likely to have a 
happy ending, even if only a tiny one -- with their jaws agape. 
The fact is that even after the "qualified ruling" put forward 
by Drnovsek's political coordinating group, very few people 
believe that nothing worth mentioning is happening in the 
country. The prime minister's sense of tact inspires hope that 
he will gradually neutralize all those antagonisms that are 
escalating matters dangerously through skillful maneuvering; 
despite this, the Slovene state has absolutely no guarantees for 
the future. If everything regarding Kucan and Jansa is merely a 
metaphor for some deeper ongoing thing, for example, the 
conquest of strategic economic and political positions in the 
future Slovene society, then any possible "disciplining" of the 
participating factors can only be short-lived. Either way, the 
processes will have to run their course deep down. 
  The question is, of course, whether the Slovene organism 
will 
survive these efforts. Are there sufficient economic, 
international, psychological, and other resources for this 
supergame, which chooses one metaphor today and an entirely 
different one tomorrow, to finally run to its end? Nobody any 
longer expects a happy ending, but we cannot leave the cinema 
either.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Ljubljana MLADINA in Slovene in its 22 
March edition publishes several articles about the work of the 
military intelligence service VOMO -- the Defense Ministry 
Security Organ -- and the alleged overstepping of its authority. 
  On pages 2 and 3 the weekly publishes a report by Miha Dj. 
Stamcar and Jani Sever, which also includes photographs of 
Defense Ministry documents that support the claims made in the 
article. Even though the authors do not specify the manner in 
which they obtained the two documents, they claim that the 
documents are "originals, according to our research," and 
allegedly "connected to Operation Ljubljana, which the Defense 
Ministry initiated because of an increasing number of 
politicians and media in Slovenia who were pointing out the 
irregularities in the Defense Ministry, VOMO, and the special 
brigade Moris. However, the leadership of the Defense Ministry 
did not like this. In the opinion of the Defense Ministry these 
people should be supervised and information should be collected 
about them in order to act more effectively against them." 
  MLADINA continues: "It seems that VOMO was not directly 
engaged in this activity, but only its section connected to the 
special brigade Moris. The core of this parallel organization, 
which won the nickname `Paravomo,' consists of former and 
present operatives in individual elite combat units under the 
leadership of Jansa's most faithful men from the time of the 
formation of the maneuver structure. Beside this, there is 
supposedly also a higher level of informers, which is mostly 
comprised of the minister's friends and sympathizers from all 
over Slovenia. In Operation Ljubljana, however, it was mostly 
the operatives who took part in it and who were subsequently 
joined by experts for telephone and other types of bugging and 
private detective agencies." 
  The article adds that "some information implies that the 
Slovene police already have proof about the buggings and 
surveillance" but doubt a speedy and smooth investigation of the 
case because, "as the well-informed sources claim, the VOMO 
supposedly holds information about some dubious business 
allegedly involving the police which it could use for blackmail." 
  The first document entitled "Report No. 2/1" is typed on a 
paper bearing the heading of the Defense Ministry and dated 16 
June 1993. It is labeled State Secret, signed by Darko Njavro 
"for the special brigade Moris" and addressed "personally" to 
Mr. Andrej Lovsin, former VOMO chief, who resigned in January 
1994. The document generally summarizes the results of the 
observation of persons suspected of being involved in illegal 
arms deals, but in the fourth paragraph says: 
  "It is evident from the reports of my informers that public 
opinion, thanks primarily to MLADINA reporters, is very negative 
toward the employees of the Defense Ministry and the minister 
himself. Because of this the minister is demanding control over 
the media, as it was agreed at the last meeting. I request the 
approval of the technical means for the realization of this 
task." 
  The second document of 16 October 1993, also labeled State 
Secret, signed by Darko Njavro and addressed to Andrej Lovsin 
personally, reports on purchase of arms in Villach and their 
transport. The last sentence of the article says: "I request 
the approval for the telephone bugging of the following numbers: 
325-982, 321-954, 318-981 and 329-669" which according to 
MLADINA's footnote are all telephone numbers of MLADINA's 
editorial office.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item by Borislav Lalic] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, March 24 (TANJUG) -- Now that all the 
"peace plans" of the European Union (E.U.) have fallen through 
and when their peace-making role in the former Yugoslavia has 
become marginal, all the E.U. was left with was to stand aside 
and watch what the Americans and Russians were doing and analyze 
where it went astray and what all this meant to it. 
  The diplomatic and press circles were already conducting 
such 
analyses, although the "pax Americana" for Bosnia was not taken 
for granted, even less so as a definitive solution. These 
analyses evince an almost undivided view that hardly any good 
could come from this for the E.U., providing the U.S.-Russian 
initiative brings peace to Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia. 
  The fact that it lacked the strength, unity and skill to 
resolve the problem of the former Yugoslavia, not only confirmed 
a lack of unified E.U. policy, but could well be the seed 
undermining the Maastricht creation, which aspired to well-nigh 
turn into a federal state by the turn of the century. As 
European Commission President Jacques Delors set out, the case 
of former Yugoslavia could "Balkanize" the E.U. itself. 
  This "seed" of different interests in the E.U. ranks went 
back to the time of the beginning of the crisis in the former 
Yugoslavia. Today, even some of the E.U. member-states admit 
that Germany forced the recognition of secessionist Yugoslav 
republics and that this led to eruption of war. Ironically, at 
this time, when this drama assumed tragic proportions, life 
seems to be squaring accounts also with the E.U.: As it played 
a significant role in breaking up of Yugoslavia, so now the E.U. 
was forced to watch from a distance someone else building peace. 
  Things were nevertheless not as simple to such a degree as 
to 
have us believe that the U.S.-sponsored peace process in Bosnia 
was unfolding completely without the E.U. It was quite possible 
that the Americans, aided by the Russians, were working in favor 
of one of the E.U. members, which at first wanted to place under 
its "umbrella" the entire Bosnia, and now were satisfied with 
what was possible and realistic, i.e., half of Bosnia. 
  The peace process, which was yet to be joined by the Serbs, 
would show where this U.S.-Russian peace was going and what 
links its strived to establish or sever on the territory of the 
former Yugoslavia. One thing was, however, rather clear: In 
the new world order too, if it in fact existed, the dominant 
role of the super powers remained. At this time and in this 
case markedly more prominently that of the U.S. than Russia, but 
undoubtedly of both. The European Union would have to by all 
means draw the conclusions from this.

Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Zagreb, by an unidentified 
correspondent; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Prior to his departure to Zagreb tomorrow, 
Veljko Knezevic, head of the office of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia in Zagreb, was received by Federal Prime Minister 
Radoje Kontic. After the talks, Mr. Knezevic made a statement 
for the Radio and Television of Serbia and TANJUG. 
  [Correspondent] What did you discuss with Prime Minister 
Kontic? 
  [Knezevic] My trip to Zagreb tomorrow. Prime Minister 
Kontic spoke about the importance he and thus the Yugoslav 
Government attach to the beginning of the process normalizing 
relations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and 
Croatia. He expressed a certain optimism that this 
normalization would occur even quicker than presently thought. 
I would like to see this happen. 
  I am also optimistic to some extent that the normalization 
will take off regardless of the delays and possible difficulties 
that will arise, as our relations are naturally very complex and 
very [word indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] In which segments [words indistinct] do you 
expect this normalization to be established first? 
  [Knezevic] I think that normalization will begin in the 
already designated, as you said, segments. As you can see, we 
are trying to establish PTT [post, telephone, and telegraph] 
links to start solving and resolving the complex humanitarian 
problems. 
  I think that the nature of things will be such that it will 
in fact be economic relations that will lay the foundations for 
everything, that these relations will perhaps move the fastest 
toward some kind of normalization, on the basis of mutual 
interests. When and how the complete political solutions will be 
found remains to be seen.

  [Text] Belgrade, Mar. 24, IRNA -- The gratuitous arrest of 
over 400 Muslims and the widespread use of torture in the 
Sandzak region of the former Yugoslavia is a source of grave 
concern, the Humanitarian Law Fund said in Belgrade Wednesday. 
  At a press conference in Belgrade, Chairwoman Natasha 
Kandich 
urged that all allegations of inhuman behaviour be impartially 
investigated by parliamentary bodies, and members of the police 
found responsible sent before the courts. 
  In particular, the responsibility of members of an 
investigatory commission of the Serbian Ministry of Internal 
Affairs should be established for their participation in a 
cover-up of police misconduct, fund representatives said. 
  The situation in the Sandzak, a region covering parts of 
Serbia and Montenegro, is now dangerously similar to that in 
Kosovo, where almost 2 million Kosovo Albanians live in severe 
repression by the Serbian authorities, Kandich said. 
  The main difference is that Albanian Muslims frequently die 
in prison, whereas no deaths in detention have as yet taken 
place in the Sandzak, she added. 
  Between January 27 and February 22, the discriminatory 
arrest 
of members of the Party for Democratic Action (SDA), which 
rallies Muslims was carried out by the Serbian-Montenegrin 
authorities. 
  Investigating individual cases of brutality, the fund 
established that torture of Muslims is systematically applied, 
in contravention of the constitution and international covenants. 
  Detainees were forced to testify against themselves by 
beatings, sometimes with heavy metal bars, electric shocks, 
beating on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, the use 
of truncheons on the testicles, strangulation, strong light and 
deprivation of food and water. 
  Police make no effort to hide their Serbian extremist 
allegiance, Kandich said, and threaten prisoners with the names 
of Serbian terrorists such as Vladislav Seselj and Arkan, a 
well-known criminal. Both names are linked to atrocities 
against the non-Serb populations in Croatia and Bosnia. 
  Some of the prisoners were blind-folded and taken to places 
in Bosnia, the fund stated. Prisoners were kept in excess of 
the 72 hour legal limit and their families were not informed of 
their whereabouts. 
  The arrested were charged with illegal possession of arms, 
but charges were exaggerated in order to point to a conspiracy 
to secede from Serbia Montenegro, lawyers said. The true 
reason, in the fund's opinion, is twofold: One, to prevent the 
functioning of a legal political party (the SDA) and secondly to 
terrorize the Muslim population in order to carry out "ethnic 
cleansing" of the region. 
  No action has been taken against Serbs, Montenegrins or 
other 
nationalities in the area, who openly boast of being armed, 
representatives said. 
  According to the fund, most of the arms were acquired in a 
wave of fear in 1991 when war broke out between Croats and 
Serbs. "The only difference," a spokesman said, "is that Serbs 
acquire their weapons from their army in Bosnia, while Muslims 
buy them." 
  The present trial of 25 Muslims in Novi Pazar is a rigged 
political process, representatives said, where all legal rights 
of defence have been set aside. Admissions extracted under 
torture are being used in evidence against them, while the 
accused have already been condemned in the press without trial.

Renewal Movement (SPO), by Albena Shkodrova; place and date not 
given: "`It Is Possible That Milosevic Is Doing a Deal With 
Greece'"] 
  [Text] [Shkodrova] At the conference of the Helsinki 
Civic Assembly you said that Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia must 
get together and discuss the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] problem. Was this an invitation? 
  [Komnenic] Of course, the Macedonian issues are first of all 
issues of those who live in the republic and call themselves 
Macedonians. We can think whatever we like on this issue, but 
this is how they feel. We, Serbs, you, Bulgarians, and the 
Greeks must accept this as a reality. 
  Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia, as neighboring states which 
are 
on their way to becoming democracies, are responsible for 
preventing Macedonia from becoming a second Bosnia. I list only 
our three countries, because I do not think that Albania will 
cooperate. 
  We must help Macedonia to find its place within a 
politically 
and economically stable framework in Europe. We all are related 
in this matter, and our interests depend on one another. 
  I am convinced that after the experience in Bosnia there 
will 
be no war in Macedonia or Kosovo. However, democratic Serbia is 
prepared to facilitate the solution of any problem in the 
Balkans, even the Macedonian one. This is a major issue for 
Bulgarian policy and you cannot ignore it. Naturally, we 
respect this. Simultaneously, however, Serbia should not get 
involved in the Macedonian issue. 
  Greece's decision to impose an embargo on the republic is 
not 
prudent at all. On the other hand, Bulgaria's immediate 
recognition of Macedonia -- I think that this was proposed by 
your current ambassador to Rome, Stefan Tafrov -- was a very 
prudent step. 
  The three states must do everything possible in order to 
preserve the balance in the Balkans and facilitate the 
withdrawal of the U.S. "Blue Helmets" from Macedonia. I think 
that we could ensure peace here much easier than U.S. soldiers. 
  [Shkodrova] Do you think that the three states could reach 
an agreement on Macedonia? 
  [Komnenic] It is not our business to resolve this issue. 
However, we must manage our relations with Macedonia very 
prudently -- without any expansion claims. We must be 
exceptionally careful and restrained, rather than follow an 
aggressive policy like Papandreou's present one. It is my 
personal conviction that Serbia will never enter a conflict 
because of Macedonia. 
  [Shkodrova] Do you really think that Yugoslavia will follow 
the policy that you outline? 
  [Komnenic] This is the policy of Serbia's democratic 
opposition. I am not describing to you Belgrade's official 
position. 
  [Shkodrova] Does Serbian public opinion coincide with yours? 
  [Komnenic] No. Perhaps only that of part of the people. In 
Serbia there are radical nationalists who consider Macedonia a 
southern Yugoslav province, precisely as there are Bulgarians 
who think that not only Pirin, but the entire Macedonia is part 
of the Bulgarian culture, nation, and territory. The same 
apples to Greece. 
  I support the idea of a united Europe, in which borders will 
not be important. We in the Balkans are still prisoners of 
factors that have already been overcome. I would like to see 
the day when at Kalotina [Bulgarian-Serbian border checkpoint] I 
will not have to show my passport, precisely as Frenchmen do not 
show their passports when they enter Germany. 
  Integrated in such a way the Balkans could join Europe. This 
is why the Yugoslav issue is so tragic. Yugoslavia should have 
entered Europe as one entity -- then it would not have been 
important whether Serbia, Croatia, Serbian Krajina, and Bosnia 
were parts of it. 
  It does not appear to be important for 21st century Europe 
how many citizens Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece have. 
  For example, I am very proud of the fact that many young 
Bulgarian intellectuals from Bosilegrad and Dimitrovgrad are 
members of my party. Some of them were candidates at the last 
parliamentary elections. 
  [Shkodrova] Nevertheless, if Milosevic remains in power, 
which is very probable, do you think that Serbia will have any 
claims on Macedonia? 
  [Komnenic] No. I do not believe that Milosevic would like 
to fight on several fronts. 
  [Shkodrova] However, what will happen if the war in Bosnia 
somehow expands? 
  [Komnenic] The Kosovo issue will certainly emerge -- not a 
conflict, but the issue. This is the greatest Serbian issue, 
greater even than the Bosnian one. As you know, Kosovo is not 
only a territory and its population, but that part of the 
country where Serbian culture was founded, and where most of our 
monasteries are. Thus, for us Macedonia is a secondary problem, 
if it is a problem at all. It only consists of respecting the 
human rights of the Serbian minority. However, we think that 
this issue should be resolved in accordance with the Helsinki 
Agreement. 
  Thus, I do not think that Milosevic has any claims. The only 
thing I do not know and I cannot say anything with great 
certainty is whether Milosevic is making a deal with the Greeks. 
Pure logic compels us to assume the existence of such a 
possibility.

  [Text] The Committee of the Patriotic League of Belgrade 
University at its session today discussed the general position 
of other countries, particularly the Serbian lands. It 
concluded, among other things, that it should address the Serbs 
in the republic of Serbian Krajina and the Srpska republic. The 
address, which was signed by student Bratislav Zarkovic on 
behalf of the committee, states the following: 
  In the negotiations on territorial demarcation currently 
under way, the representatives of the Serbian people must not 
and cannot make under any conditions territorial and other 
concessions that would in any way harm the interests of the 
[Serbian] lands. Regardless of the pressure that the Serbian 
people are being subjected to by the international community 
during these negotiations, territorial concessions cannot be 
allowed because the territories on which the Serbs live are 
historically theirs. Therefore, this generation of negotiators 
has no right to give up these territories under any condition. 
  The address also states that it is high time for all 
patriotic forces in the Srpska republic and the republic of 
Serbian Krajina to unite because this is in the interest of all 
Serbs in all regions and in the interest of preserving their 
biological survival.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slavko Perovic, leader of the Liberal </F>
Association of Montenegro, by Slobodan Rackovic; place and date 
not given: "Montenegro Is Occupied!"] 
  [Text] Slavko Perovic -- founder and leader of the Liberal 
Association of Montenegro [LSCG], 38-year-old lawyer from 
Cetinje, 100 percent Montenegrin, one of the most frequently 
denounced politicians in former Yugoslavia, robust and 
courageous as a lion, eloquent as Demosthenes -- is a man whom 
you do not have to like or agree with, but you have to respect 
him. The same is maintained by many of his political opponents, 
even enemies, who breathlessly listen to his debates in the 
Montenegrin Assembly and other state bodies. Journalists flock 
to his news conferences, while those who dare not do that are 
most happy to have the opportunity of interviewing him.... This 
is the first time he has given an interview to DANAS, which, to 
his regret, is not on sale in Montenegro, but he manages to get 
hold of a copy through Slovenia from time to time. 
  [Rackovic] What is the argument the LSCG uses to justify the 
attitude that the LSCG is the strongest opposition party in the 
republic? The pro-Serbian National Party in the Montenegrin 
Assembly holds one seat more than your party (the liberals have 
12 out of 85 seats). 
  [Perovic] We have 20,000 registered members, an enviable 
figure for a state with 630,000 inhabitants, and some 400,000 
voters. Our membership is still growing, and that is a rather 
puzzling fact for us. Besides, at the latest undemocratic 
elections in December 1992, the ruling Democratic Party of 
Socialists [DPS] literally arranged the votes in the way that 
best suited it -- 16 percent of votes to us, 17 percent of votes 
to the National Party -- in order to build its central position 
on the unprecedented grounds -- on the national [word 
illegible]. The LSCG now holds 26 to 30 percent of the 
Montenegrin political market, which is an extraordinary 
advancement. Besides, I remind you that in Montenegro it is 
only our party's members who have been facing the street 
barricades, it is only our rallies that have been undermined. 
The police and the press have been paying most attention to our 
party, which clearly speaks for our objective strength, rather 
than the advantage in the Montenegrin Assembly. However, if it 
comes to the extraordinary elections, like those that happened 
in Serbia, we do not expect a victory of the Montenegrin bloc. 
The DPS still has its secret police, spies, the media... 
through which it can easily control public opinion. However, 
the next time the DPS will have to agree to give more number 
seats in the Assembly to the LSCG, so that no government can be 
formed without the liberals. 
  We would not go for forming any coalitions in the elections, 
we simply want to contribute to the stratification of the 
so-called Montenegrin opposition bloc. All of us who belong to 
that bloc see Montenegro as a Mediterranean, European country, 
as an open society with unlimited private ownership, which is to 
say, we see it as a modern, liberal capitalist country. Our 
allies in the Assembly -- the Social Democratic Party of 
Montenegro -- vary in their orientations, ranging from the model 
of confederation up to the model of sovereign Montenegro with 
the social-democratic system, by which they are hopelessly 
trying to manipulate the feelings of the Montenegrin citizens, 
who are still pining for the former, socialist Yugoslavia, not 
realizing that the former Yugoslav leadership actually planned 
and brought about the bloody disintegration of the union of the 
south Slavs. 
  [Rackovic] If you attain power, what will be your attitude 
toward the former Yugoslav republics? 
  [Perovic] We will recognize all the states that have 
developed from the former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia], within their AVNOJ [Anti-Fascist Council of 
National Liberation of Yugoslavia] borders. The principle of 
the unchangeability of borders is undisputable for us, and if 
that principle happens to be annulled, the region of former 
Yugoslavia will be open for war and catastrophe. As for the 
reintegration of Yugoslavia in terms of as it used to be, we do 
not even think about that, because we think it is hypocritical 
even to use that word. Simply, former Yugoslavia cannot be 
restored upon hundreds of thousands of graves. We think that 
each former Yugoslav state should be recognized, international 
recognition should be made possible for them, and we should 
leave it to time and the will of each of those states to decide 
whether they will go for the reintegration following their 
interests, or not. I would like to stress once more that I 
refer to the reintegration in terms of joint interests, rather 
than reintegration into a joint state. 
  [Rackovic] Belgrade simply does not allow Montenegro to 
cooperate with Croatia, Italy, and Albania. Some incidents have 
even been fabricated, like the one near Debeli Brijeg, by the 
border with Croatia. 
  [Perovic] Well, it is well-known that Montenegro is an 
occupied state in which there are 60,000 Serbian soldiers, while 
the lovely Montenegrin coast has been the place with the 
greatest concentration of naval forces and equipment.... Which 
is to say, we have been definitely under occupation. However, 
within that occupying force there is a lot of people who in 
their hearts support the policy of the LSCG. That trend in the 
Yugoslav Army is still active. That is not so great a surprise, 
because it is obvious that the entire state mechanism is falling 
apart, that is, a metastasis of the idea of the FRY [Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia]. Nobody can halt that process, not even 
Slobodan Milosevic, and his tanks and aircraft. In the entire 
situation Montenegro has a great chance to accomplish its 
historic goal in a peaceful way -- the independence that 
Montenegro enjoyed for centuries. 
  [Rackovic] Jevrem Brkovic [Montenegrin poet, opponent of the 
Montenegrin regime] claims that Montenegro cannot accomplish 
that goal without bloodshed. 
  [Perovic] Using the opportunity to express my sincere 
regards to my friend Brkovic, I pray to God that he is not 
right. I think that weapons should be put aside. We must not 
allow bloodshed in Montenegro, because in the first place it 
would be directed against the interest of the Montenegrin 
people, regardless of who would eventually win. That victory 
would do to us much more harm than good, so we are doing 
everything we can to convince our members and supporters that 
the way to the sovereign and independent state of Montenegro 
leads only through a referendum. We are absolutely convinced of 
our success. 
  [Rackovic] Belgrade, however, is constantly putting pressure 
on Montenegro by inciting the chauvinist Serb circles in Boka, 
Zeta, and Vasojevici, which reminds one very much of the prewar 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Perovic] In Montenegro there are no such tensions as were 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The great Serbian design has been 
politically defeated in Montenegro. Simply, it takes time for 
that defeat to reflect itself among the people. It is precisely 
those pitiful rallies in Boka, Zeta, and Vasojevici, having 
amassed a miserable number of troublemakers, that best speak for 
my being right. These are desperate moves, a consequence of the 
fact that the supporters of the great Serbian policy are losing 
their hold on Montenegro. Those rallies are organized by people 
whom the locals call Montenegrins from Terazije [a district of 
Belgrade]. Those are Belgrade's hirelings, and the interest of 
Belgrade is much more important for them than their own interest. 
  [Rackovic] Your old theory is: Not an inch more of 
Montenegro, not an inch less. 
  [Perovic] That is right. We accept Montenegro within the 
existing borders, with which we are completely satisfied. For 
us the issue of Prevlaka has never been a problem. It is a 
fictitious problem that was supposed to justify the shameful 
raid on Dubrovnik. The issue of our borders with Croatia can be 
settled only through negotiations between the sovereign states 
of Croatia and Montenegro, provided, of course, that both states 
are interested in that. As early as at the beginning of the war 
in Dubrovnik, a delegation of the Croatian Parliament came to 
Podgorica, and proposed the settlement of the Prevlaka issue 
through bilateral talks, but the Montenegrin officials, being 
Milosevic's marionette, went for the option that was supposed to 
settle some mythical relations of theirs, rather than some real 
Montenegrin relations, because of which Montenegro is still in 
such a difficult position. I repeat, the issue of Prevlaka was 
invented as a justification of the great Serbian territorial 
claims. However, that does not justify those Montenegrins who 
set so many houses on fire in the region, and killed the people 
there. Behind every single crime there stands a concrete 
person. And one day they will have to take the consequences for 
what they did. For a long time Montenegro will be paying for 
its thoughtlessness, for its having attacked Dubrovnik and its 
people, who were our friends for centuries. When the 
Montenegrin borders were proclaimed administrative, we protested 
against that, because we understood that is the introduction to 
a war. We did not manage to influence the course of events, but 
we still did a lot to make the Montenegrin citizens understand 
in time what a ploy it all was, and to diminish in this way the 
immense tragedy of Dubrovnik. 
  [Perovic] We are now making efforts to improve relations 
with Croatia, and to make the border crossing at Debeli Brijeg 
completely open, which also applies to all the border crossings 
to the neighboring countries. Being occupied in such a way, 
fettered, driven into this quasi-state, we have no chance. We 
have to find a way to apologize to Dubrovnik and Croatia for 
what we did there. After all, even before the war started we 
had established excellent relations with the Croatian 
Social-Liberal Party [HSLS], then with the Slovene liberals, 
with the Muslim Bosniak Organization and the liberals led by 
Rasim Kadic in Bosnia- Herzegovina, with the liberals led by 
Stojan Andov in Macedonia, and in Serbia with the parties of 
Nenad Canko, Vesna Pesic, while we still cooperate with Vuk 
Draskovic, regardless of his nationalism.... Despite the war, 
we have managed to maintain those relations, to my great 
pleasure, while with Drazen Budisa's HSLS we have even managed 
to improve those relations. 
  [Rackovic] You do not recognize the FRY, and you call it the 
so-called FRY. 
  [Perovic] I feel about the FRY that it is a result of a 
great deceit, and war-mongering policy. From the point of view 
of law and politics, it is a farce, which is best shown by the 
fact that even last year we celebrated the Day of the Republic 
on 29 November [the day when AVNOJ Yugoslavia was established in 
the Bosnian town of Jajce], a holiday of the republic that does 
not exist any more! Jajce is not to be found in that state any 
more, it is devastated and burnt down. That is an example of 
hypocrisy unprecedented in the history of mankind. The 
authorities in Montenegro announced a referendum (which was 
boycotted by the democratic opposition), at which the citizens 
had to state their opinion about the future of their fatherland. 
Let me not remind of the fact that only seven days passed from 
the day when the decision on the referendum was made, to the day 
when the referendum eventually took place. The question was so 
ambiguously formulated that the government could not but win. 
Or, for instance, one man voted for entire families, or even 
for his entire village. It was an incredible farce, so today 
many people come up to me and apologize for having voted for the 
federation of Montenegro with Serbia, that is, for the FRY. 
  We do not want to live in that state, because when we look 
at 
Belgrade, we understand that Serbia is politically contaminated, 
that it will take decades for it to be politically 
decontaminated. For a long time it will be impossible to 
establish Serbia as a lawful, democratic state with a European 
orientation. We want to leave the union, because Montenegro 
still has a considerable chance to get away, and to win 
international support. Of course, we do not demand the life of 
a single soldier for Montenegro, we do not demand intervention 
by either NATO or anyone else. We also do not want our people 
to get killed for Montenegro, but we have to clearly express our 
political will, and to bring Milosevic to a halt: either he will 
send tanks to kill us, or he will eliminate the most 
distinguished Montenegrins with the help of his secret police. 
Yet, tyranny will solve nothing here, and I am happy to assess 
that the movement for independent Montenegro has grown so strong 
and huge that nobody can halt it any more. The situation is 
exactly the opposite: The greater the pressure that Belgrade 
puts on us, the stronger the people's awareness of the need for 
the Montenegrin state to become independent. 
  We are proposing to the authorities that they examine public 
opinion now, precisely two years after the referendum, but they 
persistently refuse to do that, fabricating with the help of the 
media a monstrous lie that, in the case of the liberals' 
victory, a civil war will break out. We say that there will be 
no war, because for a war two parties are needed, whereas for 
carnage a single one will do.

Chemical Substances"] 
  [Text] Ismet Veliqi, Avdi Behrami, and Azem Gashi, former 
military officers and members of the former people's defense 
forces of Skenderaj [Srbica], whom the Serbian police arrested a 
few days ago, are being brutally maltreated in Mitrovice Prison, 
the Information Committee of the Kosova Democratic Alliance's 
Mitrovice branch reports. 
  It is reported that they are being tortured at night by 
employees of the Serbian security services, who come specially 
from Prishtina. It is reported that the Serbian interrogators 
are using chemical substances, electric prods, and other methods 
to torture the former Albanian officers. The detainees' 
condition is very serious. Torture during the investigation 
process suggests the preparation of another political show 
trial, this time of former Albanian Army officers in Kosova.

  [Text] Novi Sad, Mar 23 (TANJUG)--Spring field work is in 
full swing in the Yugoslav granary Vojvodina but the shortages 
of diesel fuel represent the main problem due to the oil and 
overall embargo against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  "Besides seeds, there are not enough necessary raw materials 
for sowing," Miroslav Sandzakov, Vojvodina assistant secretary 
for agriculture, told TANJUG. 
  A record 1.35 million tonnes of oil were produced in 
Vojvodina last year, sufficient to cover one-quarter of the 
country's overall needs. According to the energy balance made by 
the government, agriculture has absolute priority. 
  Around 800,000 hectares of the 1,080,000 hectares in 
Vojvodina have been plowed so far. Agricultural producers 
expect the state to ensure the necessary fuel for the plowing of 
the remaining 280,000 hectares. 
  Due to the ban on imports of natural gas, factories for the 
production of artificial fertilizers are working at reduced 
capacity. It is estimated that around 60 percent of this year's 
needs will be met and this will consequently lower the output. 
  Experts estimate that the northern Serbian province of 
Vojvodina could under normal conditions provide food for four 
times the number of inhabitants of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia. 
  Besides its 10.4 million inhabitants, the Federal Republic 
of 
Yugoslavia cares for refugees from the former Yugoslav republics 
torn by war. There are around 500,000 registered refugees but 
the total number of refugees is estimated at 700,000. 
  According to data of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, 
the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is currently in the group of 
countries which cannot feed their own population. Until the 
introduction of the international blockade in May 1992, 
Yugoslavia not only satisfied its needs in foodstuffs but also 
exported significant surpluses.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] New York, March 21 (TANJUG) -- Croatian President 
Franjo Tudjman told the United Nations Security Council on 
Monday that Croatia would accept an extension of the UNPROFOR 
mandate provided the U.N.-protected area of the republic of Serb 
Krajina be incorporated into Croatia. 
  Next week, U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is to 
ask the Security Council to extend the mandate of the U.N. 
protection force in former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR), which is due 
to expire on March 31, for another year. 
  Speaking at a session held behind closed doors, Tudjman said 
that the argument that a framework for a comprehensive political 
solution to the problem of this UNPA [UN protected area] has yet 
to be found no longer stands. He said that the political 
framework had been precisely set through the international 
recognition of the Republic of Croatia and its outside borders. 
  The argument which no longer stands is one of the points of 
the plan made by international mediator Cyrus Vance, under which 
Krajina was proclaimed an UNPA in the spring of 1992 and 
according to which peace-keepers have been deployed there. 
  The republic of Serb Krajina was proclaimed by Serbs in 
their 
ethnic and historical territories in Croatia in answer to the 
forcible secession of this former Yugoslav Republic from the 
former Yugoslavia and the degradation of their civil and 
national rights by the Croatian authorities. 
  Despite the fact that Krajina is an UNPA, Croatia attacked 
it 
four times, as Butrus-Ghali himself said in a report for the 
Security Council, in attempts to reinstate its authority there 
by force. 
  Tudjman said that Croatia was suffering huge economic losses 
because of the current situation in the UNPA and that it could 
not tolerate the "inefficiency" of the UNPROFOR indefinitely. 
  Tudjman set out that the only matter that could be discussed 
was the degreee of autonomy for the Serb population in areas 
where they were the majority before 1992. He said that this 
meant only the districts of Knin and Glina. 
  The Krajina population has held two referendums so far and 
opted against reintegration into Croatia? Krajina President 
Milan Martic on Sunday said that Krajina Serbs would not yield 
their right to self-determination. 
  Tudjman urged the quick return of refugees to the UNPA and 
said, in threatening tones, that Croatia would not be able to 
prevent thousands of refugees from trying to return to their 
homes if they could no longer control their desperation. 
  Croatia fears that this could have undesired consequences on 
the peace process which is underway, Tudjman said, in an evident 
desire to find an alibi for possible future Croatian attacks on 
the republic of Serb Krajina.

  [Text] Knin, 23 Mar (TANJUG)--Following Serb-Croat talks in 
Zagreb, Slobodan Jarcevic, minister of foreign affairs of the 
republic of Serb Krajina, described in a statement to TANJUG the 
fact that both sides had given guarantees that they would not 
try to resolve their problems on the battlefield as the most 
important outcome of the talks. 
  Both Krajina and Croatia lodged guarantees to this effect 
with the mediators: Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy 
Churkin; U.S. Ambassador in Zagreb Peter Galbraith; and Kai Aide 
and Geert Ahrens, cochairmen of the Conference on Former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Jarcevic said that there was a possibility that next 
Tuesday, 
29 March, an agreement would be signed, but only on an end to 
clashes and hostilities. He described this as the main goal of 
the negotiations. All other issues of common interest will be 
put on the agenda later. 
  He said that no pressure was put on either of the sides 
during the negotiations and that the mediators were there to 
help, but with a clear message that the world had had enough of 
war and bloodshed. 
  The mediators stressed that it was up to the opposing sides 
to decide on how to regulate their future relations, but this is 
an issue for political negotiations and was not mentioned in 
Zagreb, Jarcevic said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slobodan Jarcevic, foreign minister of the </F>
republic of Serbian Krajina and head of the Krajina delegation 
at the negotiations in Zagreb, by Dragoljub Stankic in Knin on 
23 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Stankic] Good day, Mr. Jarcevic. 
  [Jarcevic] Good day. 
  [Stankic] How did the talks at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb 
go, and have any results been achieved? 
  [Jarcevic] The biggest result lies in the fact that the 
negotiations have begun and are being held in the building of 
the Russian Federation in Zagreb. 
  We have achieved several good results. The first is that the 
delegation of the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] went to 
Zagreb and that the fear that is always hanging over us whenever 
we go somewhere has disappeared because the RSK delegation does 
not necessarily have to betray the interests of its people and 
its state, even if it travels to Zagreb. It can hold talks with 
the Croatian authorities on an equal footing. 
  Another important fact is that we heeded the demands of the 
two biggest powers -- the Russian Federation and the United 
States -- to meet with the Croatian representatives in the 
Russian Federation's building, because these two countries said 
that the world community is fed up with the bloodshed in the 
former Yugoslavia and that they are inviting us to come to the 
negotiating table because they want to see the end of 
hostilities, they want to see peace, and that after that 
relations between the RSK and Croatia normalize. 
  They guaranteed that in this way they would prejudice the 
political solution and that they are not interested at all in 
the kind of life the ethnic communities of the former Yugoslavia 
would establish in the future. They asked us to believe that 
they sincerely want to help us stop the suffering of all 
peoples. We accepted this message and went to Zagreb. 
  [Stankic] The end of hostilities and the cease-fire assume a 
clear demarcation line. Did you discuss this? 
  [Jarcevic] The line of demarcation was the main topic of our 
talks. You know we are talking about a border of some 1,600 
kilometers. Because the border of such a length is varied, it 
was not easy to agree on one simple principle that could be 
applied on every kilometer of the border. This is so because in 
some places the border passes through populated areas, in other 
places it is near populated places, in some places it is near 
industrial plants, or goes over the fields rich with ore or oil. 
It is particularly interesting that the border passes near 
Jasenovac [World War II camp], which is a sacred place for the 
Serbian people. For these reasons, we could not apply a single 
principle. 
  The greatest part of the talks were spent looking for 
possibilities to meet the demands of the Croatian side in some 
areas, and the demands of the Serbian side in other places. I 
think that we have come to the conclusion that in withdrawing 
our armies, we should apply symmetry. This means that when we 
require their withdrawal for no more than 100-200 meters, we 
will give the same opportunity to the Croats to require our 
withdrawal where they need it. I think that this is one of the 
most important results of the talks held yesterday. 
  Furthermore, it is also important that the Croatian 
delegation has given us guarantees that they would no longer use 
the military means to accomplish the programs of their 
government, but that, regarding relations with the RSK, they 
will do it only through negotiations. 
  [Stankic] Since you are talking about the military means, we 
should also say something about the interpretation, about how 
the borders are set in the areas in which the Army of Croatia 
has invaded the territory of Krajina. 
  [Jarcevic] Of course, had it not been for the parts which 
the Croatian Army had occupied, there would be no problems and 
we would have most certainly signed an agreement yesterday on 
the cease-fire and the end of hostilities. It is in fact in 
these territories that we are experiencing the greatest 
problems. We returned to Knin to consult the government and 
other authoritative bodies in the RSK. One of the reasons as to 
why the negotiations could not continue is the imprecisely drawn 
position of both armies on the maps provided by the United 
Nations Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]. Moreover, UNPROFOR showed 
these maps to both delegations only shortly before the meeting 
began. This is why we need seven days to study the maps and to 
mark the actual situation on the line separating the two armies. 
  [Stankic] It was also decided at the Russian Embassy in 
Zagreb to continue the talks. 
  [Jarcevic] The talks will continue and this is a good sign 
that the RSK has been accepted as an equal partner in talks with 
the Republic of Croatia, especially since we were brought to the 
negotiating table by the two biggest powers in the world -- the 
United States and the Russian Federation. In addition, the 
talks were also attended by the deputies of the cochairmen of 
the conference on the former Yugoslavia, top UNPROFOR officials, 
and representatives of the European observer mission. 
  Let me again repeat that no one exerted pressure on the RSK 
delegation. We held the talks in a relaxed atmosphere that was 
not disturbed by anything.

  [Text] On his return to Knin, Slobodan Jarcevic, member of 
the delegation of the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] at the 
negotiations in Zagreb and foreign minister, held a news 
conference. Jarcevic said that both sides agreed not to mention 
the possible political solutions during the talks and to discuss 
only a cease-fire and the end of hostilities. Dragoljuib 
Stankic reports from Knin: 
  [Stankic] The main reasons why the RSK delegation had 
accepted the invitation to take part in the negotiations is the 
desire of the Serbian side that peace be established and 
hostilities end. This was stated by Foreign Minister Slobodan 
Jarcevic at the beginning of the news conference, adding the 
following: 
  [Begin Jarcevic recording] Messrs. Vital Churkin and the 
U.S. ambassador guaranteed us that they would exert their 
influence on the Government of the Republic of Croatia so that 
it no longer resorts to arms and crosses the border that has 
been established between the RSK and Croatia with the agreement 
reached in Geneva on 23 November of 1991, and whose lines were 
confirmed by the agreement in Sarajevo on 3 January 1992. [end 
recording] 
  [Stankic] According to Jarcevic, the negotiations in Zagreb 
were not prepared in the best possible way, because both sides 
only acquainted themselves with the proposed maps on their 
arrival in the Russian Embassy. Considering that the border of 
some 1,600 kilometers is running through many villages and 
towns, and that there are many disputed facts, both delegations 
need to consult their governments so that the interests could be 
articulated in a much better way at the new negotiations. 
  Thus, the talks have not been broken, but will resume next 
Tuesday [29 March]. At this meeting, new maps will be 
presented. These, as Jarcevic said, will not deviate even one 
meter from the real situation on the ground. 
  Journalists' questions mainly referred to the possible 
political solutions. Slobodan Jarcevic said several times that 
this was not discussed. He mentioned the resolve to finally 
establish peace as the most important result of the talks 
yesterday.

<F P=106> [Interview with Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic by </F>
Jose Ramiro Villapadierna in Zagreb; date not given] 
  [Text] Zagreb -- He has been working 18 hours per day 
since he took office. He insists that he is not a politician 
but a businessman, insists on his being allowed to work, and 
insists that "I never grant interviews," because the economy or 
the war "are very important matters to be summarized and then 
interpreted well." He has governed under the pressure from the 
lobby of the Croats of Herzegovina, and, despite his successes, 
he wants everything to be over soon so that he can return to the 
world of business. 
  [Villapadierna] Does the communist system still weigh 
heavily, with the streets full of people at 1100? 
  [Valentic] People are not only on the streets instead of 
working; we also have the highest percentage of pensioners in 
Europe. The change with respect to communism is that we make 
sure of our resources before spending them; previously, they 
used to spend and then look for somebody to pay. In situations 
of severe inflation of around 10,000 percent per year, everybody 
can be businessmen, but the burden falls on the people who are 
increasingly poor. It is always easier to make the currency 
rise artificially on the black market and thereby meet your 
losses than dismiss 20 percent of the workers, buy new 
technology, and be competitive. This process will take around 
10 years; bear in mind that Germany has been investing in its 
eastern part for four years, and they have not resolved more 
than 20 percent [sentence as published]. 
  [Villapadierna] How much are you spending on arms and on 
receiving refugees? 
  [Valentic] We have 600,000 refugees -- that is, 15 percent 
of our population -- in the free part of Croatia, since the 
other 25 percent remains occupied; even this part has also been 
largely ruined. Tourism, which was our economic mainstay 
(between 3 billion and 4 billion [currency unspecified]), has 
also been destroyed, as has the energy system. We have had to 
raise 6 billion German marks [DM] in foreign debt, because 
Belgrade took all the Yugoslav reserves. I will not conceal the 
expenditure from you, although it is before parliament. Out of 
a budget of DM5.2 billion, around 35 percent is for defense, 
which is not excessive for being at war, and 20 percent is taken 
up by caring for the hundreds of thousands of refugees. Just 
imagine: If these resources were earmarked for restructuring 
the economy, Croatia would be reborn in two years. 
  [Villapadierna] When can the former Yugoslavia's property 
held by Belgrade be shared out? 
  [Valentic] Some far-off day; Yugoslavia will not join the 
normal economic systems, and Serbia, for its part, will do all 
that it can to delay settlements. Slovenia, Macedonia, and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are involved, and some day Serbia will have 
to give in. We know very well each republic's share of the 
social product; Croatia's was 27 percent. The problem is that 
the Serbs will spend everything; they are spending even the part 
which is frozen. 
  [Villapadierna] With the Bosnian federation, have you not 
handed the plan's destruction to Karadzic on a platter? It is 
sufficient for the Serbs to say that they accept, only for the 
Croats then to withdraw, and it will all be over. 
  [Valentic] You are right to say that the Serbs have the 
decisive say. A federation with them or without them will not 
be the same thing. To be honest, the problem of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina is the most complex and crucial of the present-day 
world, but, indisputably, there is always a solution in 
politics; normally, it is the least bad. 
  [Villapadierna] Will Bosnia be divided? 
  [Valentic] This war is drawing to a close. At last, four 
forces -- the United States, Russia, the Islamic world, and the 
European Union -- are coming together for this to end. To be 
specific, there are two options: One is for the Serbs to agree 
to join the Bosnian federation; the other is for them to say 
"no," and in that event the Muslims and Croats would federate in 
order then to confederate with Croatia. There are many nuances, 
but there is only one thing clear: We will effect no kind of 
integration reminiscent of the former Yugoslavia, nor does any 
of the powers believe so now. 
  [Villapadierna] When will Croatia join the Council of 
Europe? 
  [Valentic] There are some terms which Croatia has had to 
fulfill: I believe that we have done so and that some criticisms 
are unfair; a country which is emerging from communism and at 
the same time is at war cannot resolve everything in two years. 
Despite the war, I believe that we have made considerable 
progress in the freedom of the press, as in other areas of the 
law; we have all the attributes for joining the Council of 
Europe. 
  [Villapadierna] Your monetary policy has ended the 
depreciation and inflation, but everybody believes that it is an 
artificial situation. 
  [Valentic] Monetary policy is conducted by the Bank of 
Croatia, although this forms part of a whole economic strategy. 
Over the past few months we have had a zero inflation rate. 
There is a coherent combination of wages, financial policy, and 
the restructuring of the entire communist economy. We have 
eliminated the price disparities inherited from communism and 
introduced the tax system which is standard in the West; this 
has increased the state budget by around 50 percent, and the 
latter has seen its deficit fall by DM1 billion. We have 
launched the restructuring of the economy, privatization has 
been accelerated, small stockholders have begun to receive their 
dividends, taxes have been cut, the average wage has risen from 
DM100-200 to around DM400 at present... When I opted for free 
convertibility, everybody deemed me a madman, but I knew the 
makeup of our exports and opted for opening up.

Serbian Krajina, on Knin Television on 23 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serbian 
Krajina [RSK], today addressed RSK citizens and deputies of the 
RSK Assembly via Knin Television. Here is Milan Martic's 
statement that we received from Knin: 
  [Begin Martic recording] Citizens of the RSK, the current 
work of the republican parliament, which is primarily 
characterized by some political divisions and a one-sided 
imposition of the coalitions' stands, is leading the state into 
total chaos and anarchy. 
  As president of the RSK, I will not allow this. In these 
exceptionally difficult times for our state, when, in addition 
to all the other pressures and difficulties, we are achieving 
significant results on the international political scene, we are 
encountering obstacles that are exclusively the consequence of 
such work by the assembly. As president of the republic and the 
supreme commander of the armed forces, I will not allow the RSK 
to become a (?battlefield) for political showdowns between 
political parties [word indistinct]. 
  Citizens of the RSK, fighters, workers, and pensioners, I 
demand that you raise your voice to remove the obstacles caused 
by the work of the parliament, to reexamine the mandate you have 
loaned to some deputies, and to call them to account. 
  The respected deputies must know that they have been elected 
by you and that they are only accountable to you and not the 
political leaders whose dictates they are now implementing.

<F P=106> [Report by Milan Cetnik: "Bjegovic's Maneuver"] </F>
  [Text] Knin, 22 Mar -- A few days ago, during the 
parliament session, the Krajina Government resigned. What the 
average television viewer in Knin and Belgrade was able to learn 
on the basis of news reports is that the assembly "does not 
like" its government and that Bjegovic's cabinet, insulted and 
"humiliated," "no longer wants to play the game." However, the 
fact is that by resigning, Djordje Bjegovic has actually 
strengthened the position of his government and cabinet, so that 
at the moment he is virtually irreplaceable. 
  First, according to the Constitution, once a new parliament 
is elected, the existing government automatically becomes the 
caretaker government. Meanwhile, until a new government is 
elected, the new parliament can remove any member of the 
government from office. However, when the prime minister 
resigns, something that prompts the resignation of the entire 
cabinet, the Constitution prescribes that all the ministers and 
the prime minister remain in their posts until a new government 
is elected. Therefore, the government remains in place, and the 
parliament -- which did not elect this government -- cannot 
remove the ministers from their posts. 
  Bjegovic executed this maneuver with the aid of his close 
associates, the Benkovac lawyers Radomir Kuzeta (justice 
minister) and Sava Strbac (secretary of the government). In a 
statement to TANJUG, Strbac confessed that by resigning, 
Bjegovic "protected" the members of the government. The 
government submitted a report on its activities to the 
parliament as part of the seventh item on the agenda. The 
eighth item on the agenda was the removal of the information 
minister. By this time, Bjegovic and his advisers had already 
come up with the life-saving maneuver -- resignation. However, 
when it was time to tackle the seventh item on the agenda, the 
prime minister briefly left the assembly hall, the information 
minister was removed, and the resignation followed. 
  Therefore, the items on the agenda were switched, and 
government sources said that Bjegovic had actually sacrificed 
the unpopular lady (Tanjga was removed from power by a unanimous 
vote of the parliament), while protecting himself and the 
remaining ministers! 
  For three days, the deputies of the parliamentary position 
(from Babic's and Seselj's parties) and those of the 
parliamentary opposition (Martic's people and others) tried to 
outwit each other, certain important decisions were made despite 
the complaints of the minority that the majority was behaving as 
the majority, the ministers preached to and praised deputies, 
and the "position" monitored the procedures like the apple of 
its eye.... However, it was absolutely clear that the 
parliamentary session was overshadowed by two people who are not 
shadows, namely, the two Milans (Martic and Babic), who were 
watching the live television relay in some unidentified place, 
and who sporadically used couriers to summon their people 
(Bjegovic and Kovacevic) for new consultations and new 
instructions! 
  In the current distribution of power, it is clear that the 
president of the republic is far closer to the government than 
the parliament, and that the parliament is some kind of 
opposition on the Krajina political scene. Martic has nominated 
Mikelic, whom he describes as a "prominent political worker" as 
prime minister designate of the new government. However, the 
majority of 45 deputies have already rejected him. On the other 
hand, Babic's party has issued a public statement saying that 
Mikelic was the man whom, four years ago, Zagreb (Ivica Racan) 
dispatched to Knin, while today Belgrade is offering him as the 
savior (?). 
  Even in the area where accord is necessary and unavoidable 
(negotiations with the Croatian regime) there remains a distance 
between the, for the time being, irreconcilable opponents. The 
parliament has nothing against the Zagreb negotiations, but it 
has stressed that it is waiting for a report on the basis of 
which it will either reject or accept the possible decisions 
reached at the Russian Embassy. 
  On two occasions yesterday, the majority in the parliament 
"washed its hands" of the alleged bianco agreement for the 
Zagreb negotiations. This was first denied by Drago Kovacevic, 
head of Babic's deputy caucus, and late last night by the 
parliament chairman, Radical Branko Vojnica, who denied the 
claims of Knin Television.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 23 (TANJUG) -- President of the Serb 
municipality of Zadar Mladen Kalapac on Wednesday asked Italy to 
protect Serb refugees from this port-city on the Adriatic from 
the Croatian authorities who are terrorizing them. 
  In a letter to Italian Prime Minister Carlo Ciampi and 
Secretary of the National-Social Movement Gianfranco Fini, 
Kalapac said that he was addressing them on behalf of the 42,000 
Serbs banished from Zadar who have met the same fate as Italians 
did after the Second World War, said the news agency ISKRA of 
the republic of Serb Krajina. 
  Zadar and a considerable part of the Dalmatian coast were 
part of Italy until September 1943. 
  Zadar is in close proximity to the republic of Serb Krajina 
which was formed by Serbs in their ethnic and historical lands 
in Croatia in 1991 in answer to its forcible secession from the 
former Yugoslavia and the downgrading of their national rights 
by the Zagreb authorities. 
  Since the beginning of Croatia's war for secession, 14,000 
Serbs have been killed and more than 300,000 banished from this 
former Yugoslav republic. 
  Around 10,000 houses belonging to Serbs have been blown up 
all over Croatia in the past three years. 
  Special rapporteur of the United Nations Human Rights 
Commission Tadeusz Mazowiecki in late February this year accused 
Croatia of human rights violations and terror over Serbs, 
especially in the coastal region of Dalmatia. 
  The Helsinki human rights federation on Wednesday accused 
Croatia of forcibly evicting over 5,000 people from their flats 
and physical abuse of citizens, predominantly of Serb 
nationality.

  [Text] Knin, March 21 (TANJUG)--The republic of Serb 
Krajina (RSK) has information, detailed maps and documentation 
confirming that Croatia is depositing nuclear waste and toxic 
chemicals in western Slavonia, RSK Foreign Minister Slobodan 
Jarcevic told TANJUG Monday. 
  Jarcevic said that the deposits were being made on Mt Papuk 
in an area 35 times 50 kilometers, that is now ethnically 
cleansed from Serbs, in four locations identified so far: 
Straza, Tucak, Bilo and Lom. 
  The RSK was formed in 1991 in parts of the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Croatia populated by Serbs in response to the 
Croatian forcible secession from the former Yugoslav Federation 
and has been a U.N. Protected Area (UNPA) since March 1992. 
  The RSK Foreign Ministry has conveyed this information to 
the 
co-chairmen of the Conference on the Former Yugoslavia and U.N. 
member countries that have their troops within the UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces], Jarcevic said adding that they had not shown 
any particular interest. 
  Jarcevic said that the nuclear waste and the poisonous 
chemicals originate from Germany and are transported through 
Austria and Hungary. 
  According to further information Bosnian Moslem leader Alija 
Izetbegovic has also promised his patrons and the initiators of 
the new world order locations for depositing their nuclear waste 
and toxic chemicals on Serb territory stretching from Kupres to 
Drvar. 
  It is also reported in Knin that Greece fears that similar 
engagements were undertaken by the president of The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Kiro Gligorov and information 
about Germany's deposit of its toxic waste in Albania near the 
border with the F.R. of Yugoslavia has already been partly 
revealed.

<F P=106> [Article by E.K., Ma.S., and K.B.: "Officially, Nothing </F>
Happened"] 
  [Text] Contrary to earlier statements by politicians of 
the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak did not forward on Wednesday [23 March] a motion to the 
president requesting the appointment of Dariusz Rosati to the 
post of deputy prime minister and finance minister. In a 
morning radio program, the prime minister stated that he must 
meet with the candidate once again. 
  "One or two days are not a problem," he said. 
  "The agreements reached on Tuesday with the prime minister 
are still binding, and they will be acted upon until the end of 
the week." This was how Zbigniew Siemiatkowski summed up the 
events of the entire day. "The issue is very serious, and haste 
is not very advisable." 
  According to the prime minister, it should be explained once 
again "whether Mr. Rosati shares our views on structural 
issues." Since Professor Rosati is in Geneva, the organization 
of such a meeting will take some time, stated the Prime 
Minister's Press Secretary, Ewa Wachowicz. 
  After the evening meeting of coalition authorities on 
Tuesday, Aleksander Kwasniewski reported that the prime minister 
had given assurances to the participants of the meeting that he 
would forward the motion concerning Rosati to the Belweder on 
Wednesday. 
  "Some people tell me what I should do, as well as what I say 
and what I should say," the prime minister commented on this on 
Wednesday morning. 
  He also added that the procedure of the appointment of 
Rosati 
had been complicated by some statements of politicians; the 
advancing of the date of forwarding the appointment motion was 
termed "slightly humorous" by him. 
  SLD leaders, obviously taken aback and angry, tried to 
minimize in their official statements the absence of a decision 
by the prime minister. 
  "Well, just a slight delay that will soon be explained," 
said 
Zbigniew Siemiatkowski in the afternoon. The situation was 
similarly assessed by Speaker Jozef Oleksy. The issue of 
forwarding the appointment motion was discussed at a session of 
the SLD Club, which was closed to the press (the date of the 
session was agreed upon earlier; the deputies were supposed to 
sum up the activities of the government and the coalition). 
  "The decision has already been made, and there is no reason 
that there should be any delay in forwarding the motion to the 
Belweder," said Aleksander Kwasniewski before the session of the 
club, thus maintaining his earlier stand. He added that 
"everything in this issue will be explained." During that time, 
Jerzy Szmajdzinski tried to reach the prime minister on the 
phone. At a break in the session, at approximately 1900, 
Kwasniewski began phoning the prime minister; he refused to make 
any comments until that talk. As Siemiatkowski said, in the 
evening, Kwasniewski was in constant contact with the government 
leadership. The SLD leader, however, still refused to issue any 
information. 
  The press spokesman gave assurances that the motion 
requesting Rosati's appointment was a matter of days. He said 
that the prime minister's delay had been caused by the desire to 
meet the president personally. However, SLD politicians do not 
see a reason that any further talks with the SLD candidate 
should be conducted. 
  Yesterday's reactions by SLD politicians and the atmosphere 
in the club were very similar to the days of the greatest 
government crisis and the Borowski-Pawlak dispute. 

<H5>    Strak: Decision After Easter </H5>
  Michal Strak, head of the Office of the Council of Ministers 
[URM], stated at a meeting with journalists of the regional 
press that there is no need to turn the appointment of Dariusz 
Rosati into a sensation. "There is no reason for taking any 
violent steps," he argued and added that the delay in appointing 
the new finance minister does not threaten the Polish economy 
with any catastrophe. "We have not had the head of this ministry 
for a few weeks now, and there is nothing bad happening with the 
economy." 
  The statement by Minister Strak suggested that Dariusz 
Rosati 
will be appointed finance minister, but it will be after Easter. 
"It is better to wait a while than make hasty decisions," the 
URM head explained. Asked by RZECZPOSPOLITA whether he believes 
there are reasons to believe that the president will reject 
Rosati's candidacy, he gave a negative answer. 
  Finance Deputy Minister Henryk Chmielak stated that "the 
main 
theses and directions of the program presented by Prof. Rosati 
are in accordance with what the present government is doing." 
However, there are no details concerning the rate of the 
changes, and this is where differences of opinions may appear. 
  Even though he was awaited by journalists of the regional 
press on Wednesday, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak did not show 
up at the meeting. He stayed longer than expected in Siedlce, 
where he took part in the funeral of his office chief, Andrzej 
Piwowarczyk. On the previous day, at the session of the 
coalition, he announced, however, that he would organize a press 
conference on Wednesday. This was the only piece of information 
he passed to journalists after the coalition talks on the 
candidacy of Rosati. 
<H5>  What Does the Candidate Say? </H5>
  A few Wednesday statements concerning the candidacy of Prof. 
Dariusz Rosati: Prime Minister Pawlak for "Sygnaly Dnia" ["The 
Signals of the Day"]--about the need of several days for 
additional contact; by representatives of voivodship authorities 
of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], who are afraid of the 
continuation of the state's financial policy that has been 
conducted so far; and by Acting Finance Minister Henryk 
Chmielak, who stated that the program presented by Rosati does 
not contain any details and methods of implementation of its 
goals--suggest that the candidate is still controversial, 
despite the PSL-SLD coalition meeting. Therefore, 
RZECZPOSPOLITA asked the candidate himself whether he still 
wants to become deputy prime minister and finance minister. 
  "Prime Minister Pawlak and I have agreed that I will receive 
the final answer by the end of last week. I treat this 
situation quietly, even though I am considering various 
possibilities, including the one that I may resign. I am 
waiting for a signal because that was the agreement," we were 
told by Prof. Rosati. 
  As of Wednesday afternoon, no one from the prime minister's 
entourage had gotten in touch with the candidate. The question 
whether the delaying of the decision may be related to the 
Senate debate over the budget, in which also the issue of 
financing the Food Industry Bank and the restructurization of 
the sugar industry are discussed, were left by Prof. Rosati 
without a comment. "However, there is certainly some reason for 
the delay," he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz </F>
by Mariola Balicka and Marek Zieleniewski; place and date not 
given: "An Attack on the Future"] 
  [Text] [WPROST] The Democratic Left Alliance candidate 
for the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister is 
Dariusz Rosati, who once dissociated himself from the so-called 
Balcerowicz line toward the end of the Bielecki government but 
today claims he supports your views. What can one expect from 
Rosati? 
  [Balcerowicz] I know Dariusz Rosati. He is an ambitious and 
capable man, with quite a good economic education, by Polish 
standards. The fact that he admits to having changed his mind 
puts him in a good light because not many people have the 
courage to do that. I think his change of heart was caused by 
the fact that Poland has experienced the biggest economic 
success out of all of the postsocialist countries, some of which 
were in a similar situation to ours and others in an even better 
one. Rosati is certainly intellectually qualified to lead the 
Polish economy in the right direction. Much depends on whether 
he will want to maintain Poland on the rapid development path, 
or whether he will do anything just to maintain his post. The 
political circumstances accompanying his mission are another 
issue. I think the experience with his predecessor, Marek 
Borowski [fired by Pawlak for exceeding his authority], 
strengthens his chances rather than weakens them. 
  [WPROST] What is the chief danger to the economic reforms? 
Is it the striking Solidarity's attitude of making demands, or 
is it the Polish Peasant Party's [PSL] bid to win comfortable 
jobs for its members? 
  [Balcerowicz] The danger is whether Poland can continue its 
fast economic development. This depends on political stability, 
a strong convertible zloty, and far-reaching institutional 
changes, especially an acceleration of privatization. 
Solidarity's postulates clash with all of the rules of 
accelerated economic development. This is not the first time 
this has happened. In 1993, the union upset the political 
situation and overthrew the Suchocka government without 
realizing the consequences of this action. However, in today's 
Solidarity, which has not much in common with the Solidarity of 
the past, I detect a clear group of union activists who are 
little more than politicians in a trade union disguise. They 
once tried to enter the Sejm as trade unionists, not as members 
of a party. Therefore, their current protests are an 
extraparliamentary attempt to remain on the political scene. But 
I hope their activity will bear little fruit. As far as the PSL 
is concerned, this is a unified party, but not as far as its 
program is concerned. There are major differences within the PSL 
concerning the program. How else can one explain the fact that 
the PSL's most vociferous members, who prided themselves on 
supporting private farming under the People's Republic, are now 
reluctant about privatization? For the sake of Poland, one 
hopes that the PSL becomes unified in every single respect and 
that it joins the right side. 
  [WPROST] If you were in the opposition, would you vote for 
the budget? 
  [Balcerowicz] Being a political "outsider" [previous word 
in English], I have the luxury of not having to bother with such 
thoughts. But I can tell you I would be happier if the budget 
deficit were smaller. 
  [WPROST] Speaking on behalf of the Democratic Union, Hanna 
Suchocka has accused the government of "lacking a long-term 
economic concept," a description she also applied to the present 
budget. But can a budget that is so heavily burdened with 
expenditures on social security and the servicing of public 
debts have any room for an "economic concept"? 
  [Balcerowicz] One should remember that Poland and the other 
countries of this region emerged from socialism with a very high 
proportion of budget incomes and expenditures out of the 
national income. In capitalist countries with a similar level of 
development as Poland's, this proportion is not so high, 
although it has been gradually rising since the 1930's, 
resulting in the spread of social-democratic trends in economic 
policy. On the other hand, the Asian tigers have a very low 
proportion of budget incomes and expenditures out of their 
national income, as a result of which these tigers are becoming 
richer; the rich capitalism of the West cannot bear this burden, 
and, under the influence of the economic crisis, the social 
democratic model undergoes revisions. The conclusion for us, who 
still have a long way to go before we attain developed 
capitalism, is that the implementation of a social-democratic 
type of policy, aimed not at increasing the distribution of 
global incomes and expenditures but at maintaining them at their 
present levels, would be a harmful anachronism. By pursuing that 
path, we would quickly waste the chance of rapid development. 
  [WPROST] But Professor Stanislaw Gomulka has accused you, 
as former finance minister, of having social democratic 
leanings, illustrated by your preference to spend budget funds 
on the social services. 
  [Balcerowicz] I have no deliberate inclinations like that. I 
merely failed to stop certain moves in pensions policy in time, 
as a result of which budget spending exploded, the budget 
deficit increased, and investment outlay was reduced, all in 
1991. This also had unfavorable political consequences because, 
when one increases spending and then decreases it, one ends up 
with a politically undesirable "give and take" image. We failed 
to push through the adjustments we undertook in 1991 because of 
the election campaign. It is paradoxical that, despite the fact 
that pensions in Poland have risen faster than in any other 
country in Europe, the opposition of 1991 succeeded in 
convincing society that the pensioners were the most 
economically threatened sector of society. 
  [WPROST] Do you agree that today's Cabinet is footing the 
bill incurred by the previous governments, which permitted a 
huge budget deficit to arise and failed to reform the social 
security system? 
  [Balcerowicz] Definitely not. After all, in the previous 
Sejm, the political grouping from which the present government 
stems tried to block changes to the pensions system and demanded 
even further spending. This grouping tried to compel the 
government to print an extra 20 trillion zlotys in 1993 to 
finance this extra spending. President Walesa put a stop to it 
just in time, after he had received a warning letter from a 
group of economists to which I belonged. So this group has no 
right whatsoever to complain. 
  [WPROST] You once appeared on television in a program on 
agricultural policy, and you mentioned social justice. I must 
admit it sounded rather funny coming from you. 
  [Balcerowicz] That just shows how strong the stereotypes 
about me are. Indeed, I do not use the term "social justice," 
which is abused so often for political purposes. But that does 
not mean I do not appreciate the problem of social justice. In 
that program, I said that the EEC's agrarian policy, which most 
of our peasant parties wish to emulate, is wasteful and socially 
unjust because it involves raising the prices of agricultural 
produce above market levels by means of state intervention. To 
do this, first of all so-called intervention prices, called 
minimum prices in Poland, are introduced, and. later on, 
mechanisms are introduced that make it impossible to reduce 
these prices. The purpose behind all of this is to block 
imports, with the aim of equalizing payments. As a result, the 
prices of food rise, resulting in a fall in the demand for food, 
especially on the part of the poorest sectors of society. At the 
same time, the increase in prices causes an increase in 
production costs and the emergence of food surpluses. To get rid 
of these surpluses, one must subsidize exports, in this way 
wasting money that could be better spent on other things, such 
as filling the culture gaps in rural areas. This system is 
socially unjust because, first, the high prices affect the 
poorest consumers, and, second, the advantages fall mainly to 
rich farmers because a farmer with, say, 50 hectares gets 10 
times more than a farmer with just 5 hectares. Therefore, the 
increase in prices has to be divided by the size of production. 
For these very reasons, the West is trying to abandon the policy 
of antimarket agricultural protectionism and is warning us 
against getting involved in it. 
  [WPROST] According to the press, you might run for the 
chairmanship of the new party that is due to be formed as a 
result of the merger between the Democratic Union and the 
Liberal-Democratic Congress. How far can your political 
ambitions go if you claim to be a political "outsider"? 
  [Balcerowicz] My greatest ambition is the success of the 
Polish economic reforms. I have a very personal interest in 
that. That is why I have been trying to influence public opinion 
since 1991, because I think that a reduction in society's 
susceptibility to demagoguery is vital to the success of 
democracy and the market reforms. Unfortunately, our Polish 
society is considerably susceptible to demagoguery because of 
the mass of negative experience and its exposure in recent years 
to a barrage of extremist populism.

"Government--Solidarity--OPZZ; Fax War"] 
  [Text] "Solidarity--`S'--has sent a fax to the prime 
minister. In the fax, we wrote that this was not what we had 
expected from the experts' talks," we learned from the spokesman 
of the National Section of the Independent Self-Governing Trade 
Union [NSZZ] "S." On the previous day, a fax was sent to the 
prime minister by the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ]. 
Ewa Spychalska wants to know whether the experts of the 
government and "S," who have been holding talks since Tuesday 
[23 March], are to present the Council of Ministers with drafts 
of new legal solutions that would satisfy the union's demands. 
The OPZZ does not agree to such a procedure. During a 
demonstration in Krakow yesterday, "S" Chairman Marian 
Krzaklewski stated that he had not received any "good 
information" on the experts' talks: "The first agreements are 
already being violated." 
  The decision to set up a team of experts was made by Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak and "S" Chairman Marian Krzaklewski at 
a meeting on 18 March. 
  Doubts arose almost immediately after this first meeting. 
Pawlak and Krzaklewski did not leave the conference room 
together to meet with journalists. At a press conference, the 
"S" leader stated that the team of government and trade union 
experts is supposed to translate the union's demands into the 
language of legal solutions. The Council of Ministers is 
supposed to make a political decision: either approve or reject 
these solutions. In a statement to journalists, the prime 
minister stressed that problems concerning all employees should 
be resolved in a "multilateral agreement, representing all 
milieus and unions." He believes that the experts of the 
government and "S" should work out a "mechanism for forwarding 
problems to the Trilateral Committee and to multilateral teams 
so that they can be further discussed." 
  The OPZZ felt alarmed at this "information noise," said Ewa 
Spychalska on Tuesday. She sent a fax to the prime minister; she 
wants the prime minister to explain what the team of experts 
should address. If the results of its work, in the form of 
drafts of new legal solutions, should be forwarded to the 
Council of Ministers for acceptance, the OPZZ will protest. "S" 
also expected something else from the talks of the experts, and 
it, too, sent a fax to the prime minister requesting 
explanations. 
  "We do not want a substantive discussion with government 
experts; we do not want them to teach us lessons about the 
reasons of the government. We merely want them to help our 
experts change the demands into concrete legal solutions. Then 
the Council of Ministers will make a political decision whether 
it accepts or rejects the proposed changes," explained National 
Committee Spokesman Piotr Zak. Referring to the statement by Ewa 
Spychalska about the necessity of multilateral negotiations, he 
added that "S" is not interested in talks in which one party, 
the Democratic Left Alliance, divides into two parties: the 
government and the OPZZ, and then it jointly makes decisions on 
behalf of the people. 
  The Government Press Office has avoided any comments on the 
"fax war" and the tasks of the experts' team. Its employees 
merely quote a sentence from the joint communique issued after 
the Pawlak- Krzaklewski talks. 
  "The results of the talks between the chairman of the NSZZ 
`S' and other trade unions, not unlike the results of the work 
of the experts, will be presented and discussed at a session of 
the Council of Ministers." However, no one is willing to try to 
interpret this provision. 
  Yesterday, there were strikes at enterprises in the 
Warmia-Mazurian Region; for example, the Municipal Heat Energy 
Enterprise cut off the supply of heat to the buildings of 
self-governmental and state administration for four hours. The 
"S" of the Malopolska Region staged demonstrations. A few 
hundred people took part in these protests. "S" will make 
decisions on further forms of the protest after Easter.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy by correspondent </F>
Jerzy Lesniak; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Lesniak] What were the topics discussed at the 
private conference you recently held with President Lech Walesa? 
  [Oleksy] As the press is sure to know, the president said in 
public that he would never again set foot in the Sejm. So I 
asked him for an audience on the eve of his move to his new 
residence, and our conversation actually took place in the new 
premises at the Namiestnikowski Palace. It lasted for an hour 
and a half, was most interesting and useful, and ended with a 
modest supper. However, I will not criticize the president's 
catering because I have heard that Lech Walesa is trying very 
hard to lose weight. 
  [Lesniak] Never mind the food. Could we discuss the more 
important aspects of your discussion? 
  [Oleksy] Among other things, we talked about the latest 
conflict between the Sejm and the president, the question of the 
candidate to the office of deputy prime minister, the recently 
approved state budget (as we know, the legislative process is 
not complete until sealed by the president's signature), the 
excitement in the police force generated by the Poznan affair 
(and by other things, too), the armed forces' role in the state 
security system, and the preparation of the president's 
legislative initiatives. The conversation would not have been 
complete without some gossip, but all details of that will 
remain with the interlocutors.... 
  [Lesniak] Did the president like the budget? 
  [Oleksy] Neither the president nor I is pleased with this 
year's budget.... 
  [Lesniak] So why did you vote for it, along with the rest of 
the coalition? 
  [Oleksy] Before I explain that point, let met assure you 
that I know perfectly well that old age and disability pensions 
are so low as to fall before subsistence levels, that the health 
service is deeply in the red, that education and science are 
underinvested, and that the police and the military are in 
drastic need of funds. Nor am I too blind to notice the high 
prices of, say, medicinal drugs, or services in the public 
sector. I know how much it costs to educate our children, and I 
know the social effects of unemployment, the curtailment of 
unemployment benefit, and reductions in the extent of social 
services available to the needy. I know the vast sizes of the 
sums needed by enterprises to break the vicious circle of debt 
liabilities and climbing out of the recession trough. Of 
course, when viewed from such a perspective, this year's budget 
cannot even hope to solve all of these problems because it is 
simply not in its power to do so, and we cannot hope for 
miracles. In that context, I am unhappy with the budget, just 
as the president is unhappy. However, this very same, much 
maligned budget is a good step in the direction of positive 
changes aimed at a a policy that will be oriented more toward 
social concerns. It brings with it a chance of galvanizing 
economic prospects and gives rise to the effective promotion of 
exports. 
  [Lesniak] Nevertheless, voters, including the left-oriented 
electorate, demonstrate their considerable disappointment with 
the budget.... 
  [Oleksy] Individuals are not obliged to think in terms of 
state interests, history, or macroscale policies. Indeed, it is 
difficult to talk about any noticeable improvement in the 
situation of particular families. But--so help me--it is really 
most unfair to tear the government to pieces after it has been 
in office for only four months! Let me point out to all those 
eager fault-finders that we still guarantee the upgrading of old 
age and disability pensions and wages in the public sector. 
Will even that upgrading be enough to satisfy those interested? 
Of course not! And let me put it to you bluntly: A lot of 
water will have to pass under the bridge before we come to enjoy 
universal prosperity and adequate social welfare in Poland. 
  [Lesniak] But there were so many promises made during the 
election campaign.... 
  [Oleksy] It is true that I often hear people say: "You 
promised, but there is no improvement." However, these grudges 
are not directed specifically at any concrete target. They are 
not followed by the second necessary element of the 
argument--the identification of an agency that would meet these 
public expectations more quickly and more efficiently. In any 
case, we are talking of Utopian visions here. It is certain 
that not all people in Poland will find their circumstances 
improving, and that is why the coalition must first and foremost 
protect the weakest. I am convinced that the majority of Poles 
do not expect to live the dolce vita from tomorrow 
onward; that they understand the restricting nature of the curb 
bit that is necessary if the country is to be led to development. 
  [Lesniak] So what are Solidarity's demands? 
  [Oleksy] I find the strikes imposed by Solidarity 
incomprehensible; furthermore, they do severe damage to the 
major branches of the economy as they impair the already weak 
tissue of economic life. Union activists call for a revision of 
the legally and democratically approved budget, unheard-of 
behavior in all civilized countries, but they fail to point out 
where the money is to be found, which section we should take it 
away from in order to give it to someone else. Nevertheless, I 
believe that the will to talk will prevail over the desire for 
political confrontation. The government, which had not 
concentrated much on the budget before, is now getting its 
second wind and setting briskly to work. Many program 
blueprints are already complete--for example, for combating 
unemployment, reforming the social insurance system, and 
extending wider protection to the weaker members of the public, 
who are particularly at risk from unbridled market forces. 
  [Lesniak] We hear rumors that family benefits will be taken 
away from people.... 
  [Oleksy] They will not be taken away; they will be 
rationalized. Within the family benefit scheme, 20 trillion 
zlotys [Z] [per month] go to 10 million families. In global 
terms, this is a large sum of money, but, at the individual 
family level, it works out to a mere Z167,000 per child per 
month. In better-off families, such a sum makes no practical 
difference in the monthly budget. So perhaps it would be better 
to raise the benefit to Z500,000 or Z600,000 per child, but then 
allocate it to only the most needy--for example, to the 3 
million large families? The budget outgoings would remain the 
same, but the social gain would be greater. The more affluent 
will probably never even notice the loss of Z167,000, while the 
poorer families will receive more significant amounts of money 
with which to boost the family budget. Even so, I can already 
hear protesters shouting about unequal rights, just as I expect 
to hear them if and when we decide to change the real estate 
tax. It would be calculated on the basis of the value of the 
property rather than on its area, as is done now. At present, we 
pay the same tax on a palace as on a dilapidated slum. 
  [Lesniak] What danger areas should we fear most? 
  [Oleksy] First of all, the two major financial traps: 
structural--that is, lasting--balance-of-payments deficit (at 
present, imports outweigh exports to the tune of $2 billion), 
and uncontrollable growth of domestic debt. In 1989, this 
amounted to Z2.5 trillion; today it stands at Z83 trillion, 
which is exactly the amount of this year's budget deficit. 
There are many reasons for this state of affairs, and I do not 
intend to point a finger at culprits because some reasons would 
appear to be objective. However, I do try to point out to people 
that Pawlak's government has very little room for maneuver, as 
does the coalition of the Democratic Left Alliance and the 
Polish Peasant Party. 
  [Lesniak] Let us now return to the first question, 
concerning your visit to the Namiestnikowski Palace. What were 
your impressions of the place in terms of so-called esthetic 
values? 
  [Oleksy] To tell you the truth, I do not like the 
president's new residence. I do not envy him. I would not want 
to either live or work there.... 
  [Lesniak] Thank you for talking with us.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcin Dominik Zdort: "Before the Battle; Who </F>
Will Prevent the Left Wing From Victory in the Presidential 
Elections?"] 
  [Text] The noncommunist camp, under a threat of 
left-wing domination, should select just one candidate to be the 
next president--so say politicians from the "Solidarity" 
movement. Aleksander Hall and Jaroslaw Kaczynski have spoken 
about it, while Bronislaw Geremek turned his attention to the 
fact that only candidates coming from broad camps have a chance 
in the elections, and not people put forward by individual 
parties. Pawel Laczkowski also made an appeal to the parliament 
members who formed the Citizens Parliamentary Club in 1989, to 
hold a meeting on the fifth anniversary of the June elections, 
with the goal, among others, of discussing a possible joint 
candidate for head of state. 
  It is not yet known who could possibly be the "man of the 
moment" able to prevent the "communist camp" from taking over 
the highest post in the Republic of Poland. 
"Solidarity"-derived politicians, even though they have been 
declaring their will to nominate just one candidate, may face 
some serious problems with making it happen. A majority of the 
more than 10 potential candidates has quite big ambitions, and 
it is probable that it will be hard to convince at least a few 
of them that they should not run in the 1995 elections. 
<H5>  Prime Minister's Award </H5>
  There has been talk for quite some time now in Democratic 
Union [UD] circles concerning Hanna Suchocka's candidacy. She, 
just like some other former prime ministers, has presidential 
ambitions. But the current period of left-wing domination in 
public life is a burden for the former prime minister. Until the 
presidential elections come, left-wing activists will be blaming 
the Suchocka government for the economic difficulties, which the 
Pawlak Cabinet will find it hard to overcome. At any rate, it 
seems that Hanna Suchocka's candidacy has become less and less 
likely. Even though UD politicians may think that accusations 
concerning Suchocka's having granted a 140-million-zloty award 
to herself are unjustified, it is doubtful that the view will be 
shared by the voters or by other post-Solidarity parties. 
  Under this situation, Tadeusz Mazowiecki may be UD's only 
"serious" candidate (or, actually, a candidate for the new party 
formed along with the Liberal-Democratic Congress [KLD] ) who 
could be acceptable to at least some right-wing parties. He has 
probably not given up his presidential dreams entirely. The 
political time in Poland has been flying by very quickly since 
1989, and the wounds are also healing fast.That is why 
Mazowiecki would like to just forget (and hope that this is what 
the voters have done, as well) about his disgraceful defeat of 
[presidential candidate in the previous elections] Tyminski, 
especially because right now he is the leader of one of the most 
powerful and most influential parties in Poland, which will be 
further strengthened by its merger with the KLD. Mazowiecki's 
departure for a "deserved rest" at the Belweder would be 
beneficial to his party because it would make him leave the post 
of party chairman, which could then be taken over by someone 
younger and more dynamic. Both Suchocka and Mazowiecki would 
like to be candidates of the entire Solidarity-derived camp. 
They would be approved by an overwhelming majority of UD and 
(as representatives of UD's right-wing faction) would also hope 
to be supported by at least a part of the extraparliamentary 
opposition. However, it does not seem very likely that the 
right wing, for which the presidential elections will be one of 
the last hopes for a political existence in Poland, will forgo 
coming up with their own candidate. And alas, it is very likely 
that it will not be just one candidate. 
<H5>  Dignitaries From the Right Wing </H5>
  Jaroslaw Kaczynski (just like other parties' leaders) and 
other leaders of the Center Accord [PC], which is the most 
dynamic right-wing party of all, have already mentioned a few 
possible candidates, while stressing that these would have to be 
candidates for the entire noncommunist camp. Some time ago, PC 
leaders seemed to think that a woman would be a good candidate 
for president. The names of Senator Alicja Grzeskowiak and 
former Sejm Deputy Teresa Liszcz were mentioned. But, in the 
final analysis, the right wing will most probably be looking for 
a candidate among its representatives or sympathizers who occupy 
high posts in the state hierarchy. Adam Strzembosz, chief 
justice of the Supreme Court, is the most serious candidate and 
the only one about whom there is talk currently in Kaczynski's 
bloc. Strzembosz is an unquestioned--and, importantly, a 
nonparty--authority on the right-wing side. If he agreed to run, 
Strzembosz could probably gather around himself the electorate 
of all of the parties that call themselves right-wing or center 
right-wing, and even the electorate of Solidarity. But, if he 
decides not to run after all, then, according to talk in the 
Christian-National Union [ZChN]-PC-Movement for the 
Republic-Peasant Accord bloc, Lech Kaczynski (who is also 
nonparty) would have to replace him. But Kaczynski is burdened 
with the odium of "being one of the Kaczynski brothers," and so 
the Supreme Chamber of Control chairman will be held accountable 
by the voters for real or fabricated deeds by himself and his 
brother. By the way, the latter categorically denies the 
possibility of Lech Kaczynski's candidacy. 

<H5>    Out of Solidarity </H5>
  In the right-wing camp, the possibility of nominating 
Andrzej 
Stelmachowski (Senate speaker in the First Term and education 
minister in Jan Olszewski's government) continues to be 
considered. Olszewski himself, about whom there was talk after 4 
June 1992 that he was the center right wing's main candidate for 
president, after the election defeat by the Coalition for the 
Republic and after his party was taken over by Romuald 
Szeremietiew, says (although recently in a less persistent 
manner) that he will not run in the presidential elections. Jan 
Olszewski could be a candidate for that part of the right wing 
that is associated with Solidarity. Jan Parys also made 
connections with the trade union. His enthusiasts presented him 
as a candidate for president even shortly after his dismissal in 
1992. 
  There is a contest also within Solidarity itself on who will 
be the Solidarity-right-wing candidate for president. It seems 
that the trade union's chairman, Marian Krzaklewski, began 
displaying presidential ambitions. The success of the Warsaw 
demonstration by Solidarity, in which thousands of people took 
part, and also the initiation of a wave of strikes throughout 
Poland strengthened his position a great deal. But, on the 
other hand, some politicians associated with the trade union 
would gladly support Zbigniew Romaszewski, the man who is an 
anticommunist opposition legend, a senator, and chief of the 
Solidarity Parliamentary Club. At present, Romaszewski is in 
serious conflict with Krzaklewski. There is even talk that the 
setting up of a Warsaw Solidarity club marks the beginning of 
Romaszewski's election campaign. 
  From among the somewhat more exotic right-wing candidates, 
the chairman of the Union for Real Politics [UPR], Janusz 
Korwin-Mikke, will not run this time around. His party wants to 
come up with just one presidential candidate within the entire 
"Accord of 11 November" consisting of UPR, the Party of 
Christian Democrats [PChD], the Conservative Party, and the 
Peasant-Christian Party [SLCh]. Christian-democratic activists 
from Pawel Laczkowski's party would like to suggest somebody 
else to the alliance (and to the entire Solidarity-derived 
camp): Even though PChD leader Pawel Laczkowski denies that, 
there is unofficial talk about Ryszard Kaczorowski, Poland's 
former president-in-exile. SLCh's Artur Balazs would like 
Leszek Balcerowicz to run in the elections, but it is not very 
likely that other right-wing parties would support the former 
deputy prime minister; UD would also most probably prefer 
someone better associated with the party. 
<H5>  Fight With Walesa </H5>
  Whoever from the Solidarity-derived camp runs in the 
elections will have to fight Lech Walesa for the support of 
noncommunist voters. The incumbent president is a candidate for 
the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR], which he himself 
established, even though he has not yet made a decision on 
whether to run in the elections. Officially, the reason for 
Walesa's hesitation is said to be uncertainty about the powers 
of the head of state under the new Constitution. If the powers 
were to be the same as now or even less, then, according to a 
close associate of his, Professor Lech Falandysz, Walesa might 
give up trying to win the office. But that scenario is not very 
likely. Falandysz himself admits that it is possible that Walesa 
will think that he has worked enough and can now afford to 
become a "president on the picture" and drink champaign during 
official functions. But, if the incumbent president cannot or 
does not want to run in the 1995 elections, the BBWR has a 
reserve candidate: Zbigniew Religa, a cardiologist and the 
BBWR's chairman, who is enjoying enormous popularity (recently, 
it has been even greater than Walesa's). So far, Religa has 
been stressing that Walesa is the BBWR's only candidate, but he 
will not refuse to face the responsibility if it comes to that. 
  Lech Walesa will be trying to build a presidential party 
before the elections, perhaps using the BBWR as its basis, 
although, recently, he has been leaning toward Solidarity again, 
when he made it clear that he had proposed his "citizens' 
constitutional initiative" precisely as a gesture toward his old 
trade union. Walesa has already given up trying to win the 
support of the right-wing "bunglers," even though it is probable 
that he could have gained the support of some minor parties not 
so long ago, but the president's good relationship with the 
ZChN, the SLCh, the PChD, or part of UPR is already in the past. 
<H5>  Limited Market </H5>
  All signs are that the "market" of presidential candidates 
is 
limited and that next year's battle for the supreme post in the 
country will take place precisely among those people on the 
"market"--they are well known to the political public, and they 
know each other well--perhaps with the participation of a few 
ambitious outsiders such as Andrzej Lepper snd Janusz 
Bryczkowski.

  [Excerpts] Yesterday [23 March] voters had an opportunity 
to meet Peter Boross at the University of Economics. Agnes Papp 
interviewed the prime minister there. 
  [Begin recording] [Papp] What is your opinion about the 
result of the latest survey, which shows that 40 percent of the 
population is vacillating about going to the ballot boxes at all? 
  [Boross] I hope that at least half of them will decide to 
go. 
  [Papp] What turnout do you expect? 
  [Boross] It is impossible to estimate. [passage omitted] 
  [Papp] What sort of campaign do you expect, regarding the 
tone? 
  [Boross] I am not very optimistic. If the tone of the 
campaign is to remain fair and clean, both the press and 
political players should make some sort of pledge. 
  [Papp] Prime Minister, very many people are concerned that 
the extremists will get too loud and the style of the campaign 
will deteriorate because of this. To what extent do you share 
these worries? 
  [Boross] If there are less provocative voices and less 
inciting protestations to keep up tension, than less extremism 
will occur. For extremism is often a reaction to something. 
  [Papp] What sort of protests do you mean? 
  [Boross] All kinds of protests, petitions, in writing, in 
articles. [passage omitted] At this moment extremists do not 
constitute any political danger and their upsetting the 
political balance is inconceivable. 
  [Papp] Let me quote to you another opinion poll result: The 
MDF's [Hungarian Democratic Forum] election chances of a victory 
are declining, while at the same time, the HSP's [Hungarian 
Socialist Party] chances of a victory are increasing. How do 
you see this? 
  [Boross] It cannot be denied that the HSP's position at the 
moment is better than four years ago. [passage omitted] I think 
that the Democratic Forum will achieve a better result at the 
elections than its rivals expect. 
  [Papp] You warned about a kind of left-wing danger. How 
should one interpret this? 
  [Boross] I observe with regret that the HSP seems to be 
drifting to the left. In the countryside, the old boys are 
reappearing among the ranks of the party. [passage omitted] 
Hungarian political life could very well do without this. That 
is, that a structure already removed from the agenda -- in some 
sort of new form -- should be revived. It is not even in the 
interest of the HSP, but the party probably cannot resist the 
temptation. 
  [Papp] What is your party's relationship with the other two 
opposition parties? 
  [Boross] I cannot envisage a coalition with the Alliance of 
Free Democrats [SZDSZ] as long as it is led by the hard core. 
In my mind, more and more, the SZDSZ represents two parties: 
That particular hard core, which is of left-wing tradition and 
left-wing ideology converging toward the HSP, and another 
bourgeois-middle trend, which I cannot imagine embracing the HSP 
at any time. I think that the hard core is stronger, but this 
other trend has a larger number. 
  Looking at the Fidesz [Alliance of Young Democrats] 
transformation from the start, it has taken on a 
national-liberal profile, which is taken seriously by them, it 
seems. Naturally, the national-liberal trend is a lot more to 
my taste than the liberal trend without the national adjective.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F>
Socialist Party, MSZP, by Pal Szombathy; place and date not 
given: "The MSZP Will Not Put a Wedge Between the Forces of the 
Liberal Bloc"] 
  [Text] If we want to implement a real governmental change, 
then the Socialists cannot be left out of the next government, 
Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], 
told MAGYAR HIRLAP. Talking about worrying phenomena, Horn 
indicated that they have become aware of telephone tapping, and 
certain people are watching the movements of socialist 
politicians in the vicinity of their party offices from cars. 
  [Szombathy] Recently, you have stated a number of times that 
the opposition does not know anything about the country's 
economic situation. If this is true then how is it possible to 
draw up an action program for governing? 
  [Horn] We know the size of the budget deficit, the state 
debt, and we have information on the continuous deterioration of 
the balance of payments. No one has denied that in the first 
two months of 1994 the government spent the entire budget 
reserve. Before the extension of the deadline, the state is 
facing a 230-billion-forint obligation in connection with 
compensation. However, the opposition is not aware of what kind 
of domestic, or perhaps international, payment obligations the 
government has undertaken in the period before the elections. 
We asked the government to inform Parliament about the 
country's true financial and economic balance but this was 
refused. Parallel with the coalition talks, an expert team 
should draw up a true picture that will largely influence the 
next coalition's room for maneuver. 
  [Szombathy] What can you say about the arguments that are 
used by the government to prove that the economic situation is 
much better than is claimed by the opposition? 
  [Horn] Positive results must also have been achieved in the 
past four years, but we cannot see even any traces of the 
defined concept on the change of the economic structure. It is 
futile to argue with a government that claims that agriculture 
is a successful branch of the economy and privatization has only 
positive results. In the course of this propaganda of success, I 
find it unacceptable that the government has frightened people 
with the colorful brochures that have been sent out in 1 million 
copies. Personal data was used here that gives people the 
impression that they are on file. We experienced this while we 
were collecting the candidate nomination forms. 
  [Szombathy] In what areas can the new government expect some 
surprises? 
  [Horn] In finding out what actually happened in the course 
of privatization decisions. We do not know what kind of asset 
distribution will take place in the remaining time. For me, 
giving away headquarters buildings for nominal prices is 
appalling; I am mainly thinking of the provisions to do with the 
World Federation of Hungarians. As far as we know, most of the 
asset distributions were legal, but unethical, which is a 
different matter. 
  [Szombathy] What have you experienced of the oft-mentioned 
fears of the population in the provinces? 
  [Horn] Fear can mainly be seen among the intelligentsia. In 
other social groups, the determination for change is rather 
strong. I am afraid that the campaign will become even rougher. 
We are experiencing virtually inexplicable phenomena almost 
every day: We see telephone tappings, and various cars are 
waiting around our party premises, observing the movements of 
MSZP officials. We receive many threats. Some television 
programs also contribute to inciting hatred. The radio 
dismissals can also increase the hatred. The new government will 
have to implement political rehabilitation in connection with 
these journalists, and this actually has a legal basis. 
  [Szombathy] Do you consider an opening toward the Alliance 
of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] in opposition to the Federation of 
Young Democrats [Fidesz], and toward the Christian Democratic 
People's Party [KDNP] in opposition to the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum [MDF] possible? Otherwise, would the establishment of 
various blocs result in a new isolation of the MSZP? 
  [Horn] It is impossible for the liberal bloc to gain an 
absolute majority; therefore, they will need a coalition 
partner. If we want to achieve a real governmental change then 
the Socialists cannot be left out of executive power. The 
decisive factor is whether the current opposition parties -- 
this mainly applies to the Fidesz -- will take the need for 
change seriously. However, this does not permit making an 
alliance now with the MDF. The Fidesz has to decide what kind 
of politics it wants to see implemented. We have normal 
relations with the Free Democrats because their politics are 
more predictable than those of their partner. In my view, a 
social-liberal government is a real possibility. However, the 
MSZP does not intend to drive a wedge between the forces of the 
liberal bloc. The liberals are struggling with the situation 
that they would definitely like to get into government in 1994 
and, partly because of their supporters, it is difficult to 
envisage them in opposition for another four years. 
  [Szombathy] Are we not threatened by the danger of the 
country becoming ungovernable? 
  [Horn] From the country's point of view, it would be most 
desirable if the Socialists and the possible liberal partners 
acquired a two-third majority. This has a small chance but a 58 
to 60 percent majority will definitely be needed. A two-third 
majority would only have been possible if a social-liberal 
election alliance had been formed months ago. The Fidesz's 
behavior was the main obstacle to this. But I do not think that 
the country will become ungovernable.

  [Text] President Zhelyu Zhelev has written to UN General 
Secretary Butrus Butrus-Ghali pointing out that the Balkan 
countries are burdened by their past, and that any military 
intervention by a Balkan country in Bosnia-Herzegovina, even as 
part of the Blue Helmet forces and even when prompted by the 
noblest of motives, could evoke old suspicions and animosity. 
  While the president expresses understanding for the growing 
need to increase the number of Blue Helmets, without which the 
agreements that have been reached could not be implemented, he 
points out that there is an even greater risk if soldiers from 
any Balkan country participate in the Blue Helmets. 
  President Zhelev expresses confidence that the UN general 
secretary is aware of this danger and will continue his efforts 
to seek an appropriate solution on the part of the world 
organization. 
  The Bulgarian president recalls that since the beginning of 
the crisis Bulgaria has repeatedly declared that it will not 
take advantage of the situation and will not participate in any 
military way in the events in former Yugoslavia. Bulgaria also 
appealed to the other neighboring Balkan states to do the same. 
  The president also recalls the strict observance of the UN 
embargo against Serbia and Montenegro, and stresses that, 
despite its great losses and difficulties, Bulgaria will 
continue to follow this policy.

  [Text] Geneva, March 18 (AFP) -- The latest round of talks 
on the division of former Yugoslavia's assets were deadlocked 
Friday [18 March] due to Belgrade's failure to provide realistic 
figures, diplomatic sources said. 
  Talks reopened Thursday and were continuing Friday between 
the rump state of Yugoslavia, made up of Serbia and Montenegro, 
and the other former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia, Croatia, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia -- FYROM], Geneva peace conference spokesman John 
Mills said. 
  But non-Serb sources said the talks were as unproductive as 
earlier sessions because the Serbian authorities refused to 
provide documents needed for a realistic evaluation of the 
former state's assets. 
  Mills said talks by the working group, headed by Danish 
ambassador to Berne Els Johansson, would be "a drawn-out 
process." 
  Another ex-Yugoslav working group, on humanitarian issues, 
was due to meet Friday afternoon in Geneva headed by Sadako 
Ogata of the UN High Commission for Refugees who returned 
recently from a visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Our parliamentary 
correspondents, Jarmila Tosecka and Dagmar Bazlikova, have 
details on the parliament's deliberations. 
  [Bazlikova] The first point on the agenda was the proposal 
of 
the former government, the government of Vladimir Meciar, on 8 
March to recall Marian Tkac from his post of vice governor of 
the National Bank of Slovakia. One of the reasons stated was 
the fact that Tkac had been positively vetted--that is, that he 
was accused of having cooperated with the StB [the former secret 
police]. 
  The noteworthy fact about this proposal to recall the vice 
governor is that the former opposition had presented similar, or 
maybe the same, reasons approximately a year ago, when the 
government proposed that parliament elect Tkac to the post of 
vice governor. According to some deputies from the Movement for 
a Democratic Slovakia and the Slovak National Party, some facts 
that prevent Tkac from staying on in this post have only 
gradually become known. [passage omitted] 
  [Tosecka] [passage omitted] The results of the public vote 
were as follows: 119 deputies voted in favor of Tkac's recall, 
one deputy was against it, and six abstained from voting. The 
final decision on recalling will be made by the president of the 
Slovak Republic. 
  For the time being, this is all from the parliament, where 
there is a lunch break now.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with "Serbian" Foreign Minister </F>
Vladislav Jovanovic by Axel Buyse in Brussels; date not given: 
"Officially Yugoslavia Sees Chances for Peace"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Yugoslavia is supporting "every effort 
aimed at bringing peace a step closer." Including, therefore, 
the rapprochement negotiated by the United States between the 
Bosnian Croats and Muslims. At least, this is what Serbian 
Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic claims. "We give the 
initiative credit, and we give the United States credit for 
coming up with it. However, we would like to obtain more 
information from them. Guarantees that the initiative is based 
on genuine peace, and on a just, balanced solution." 
  "The absence of war between Bosnian Croats and Muslims, the 
fruit of U.S. mediation, already constitutes the beginning of a 
political solution between them. However, the third party, the 
Bosnian Serbs, were not consulted. That is the weak point of 
the initiative. The war involves all three factions, yet a 
solution is being sought through bilateral talks," Minister 
Jovanovic said. 
  "There is nothing unnatural in this rapprochement," 
according 
to the minister, who arrived in Brussels yesterday. Belgrade is 
giving the initiative the benefit of the doubt. "If the 
intention behind it is serious, then hats off to it; but if it 
is merely a prelude to an alliance against the third party, then 
it will not work," he said. 
  Jovanovic pointed out that peace has been on the horizon for 
a long time. The blueprint is enshrined in the preliminary 
agreements that were thrashed out by the European Union (EU) in 
negotiations in Geneva. "The third parties are calling for 
peace. They want a political solution. But which one? That 
remains up in the air, because the fate of the three communities 
in Bosnia does not lie entirely in their own hands. Foreign 
forces are becoming more and more in evidence in the Balkans," 
warned the minister. 
  The Muslims, in particular, are bending to such influence, 
he 
said a little later. Who did he mean by "foreign forces"? The 
United States, among others, it would seem, who have taken the 
initiative away from the EU. "But also the Turks, Iranians, 
Saudi Arabia, all those who finance the Muslims and back them in 
pursuing the idea of a unified Bosnia," he said. 
  The Bosnian Serbs have good intentions, emphasized 
Jovanovic. 
They are prepared to live in a loose union of three republics 
[losse Bosnische unie van drie republieken], but they cannot go 
any further than that. On top of this, they are demanding 
guarantees and clarity. For instance, what form will that 
confederation with Croatia take? 
<H5>  Link </H5>
  Jovanovic replied negative when asked whether Bosnia might 
not become some form of link in the long term, the beginning of 
another new, loose, "Yugoslavia-type structure." "After 
everything that has happened, that is difficult to imagine," he 
said. Slovenians, Croats, and Muslims are afflicted with a kind 
of "anti-Yugoslavia" syndrome, stoked up by anti-Serbian 
propaganda from abroad. The problem lies with them, not 
Yugoslavia. 
  The minister also sees progress being made in Croatia 
concerning the problem affecting a part of the Serbian minority 
that declared its own independent state, the "Serbian republic 
of Krajina." The Croatian Serbs are due to start negotiations 
in Zagreb on Tuesday. "I expect them to come up with a positive 
result," Jovanovic said. 
  That solution will probably have to be approached in stages. 
"First of all, the hostilities must be brought to an end. Then, 
life must be allowed to return to normal again. Only when all 
that has been achieved can we proceed to the third, and most 
difficult, phase, i.e., embarking on political negotiations." 
The minister did not wish to speculate as to how the final 
outcome might look. "The result will have to be one achieved on 
the basis of a genuine consensus," he said. 
  Does the question of the Albanian majority in the Serbian 
province of Kosovo not threaten to rear its ugly head as soon as 
the situation in Croatia and Bosnia has stabilized? "That is a 
pipe dream of those who like fishing in troubled waters," 
Jovanovic said. "Kosovo is a different problem, one which has 
nothing to do with the Yugoslav crisis. Anyone who seeks to 
create an artificial link between that crisis and Kosovo is 
merely seeking to blackmail Yugoslavia and Serbia," he argued. 
"Kosovo is a classic problem of a national minority striving 
for separatism. The problem has to be solved accordingly. 
  A national minority has no right to its own state. Anyone 
who tolerates that is playing with fire. Because that would 
mean that the same principle could be applied in a number of 
other regions of Europe," he concluded.

<F P=106> [Press statement by President Franjo Tudjman following </F>
meetings and talks with ambassadors of UN Security Council 
members in New York on 21 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] We have, understandably, discussed, both with the UN 
secretary general and the UN Security Council, above all the 
extension of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] mandate in the 
new climate created by the signing of the Washington agreement 
on the Croat-Muslim federation and a confederation between 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. We voiced some criticism, but 
it is important in these new circumstances to have UNPROFOR's 
mandate redefined so that it can start implementing the Vance 
plan and the UN Security Council resolutions. 
  In this context we drew attention to priority tasks such as 
border controls between Serbia and Croatia, the disarmament of 
those Serb paramilitary formations -- since there is no peace 
without this -- the return of refugees, and the restoration of 
communications. We have also pointed out the willingness of the 
Croatian Government to take the necessary confidence-building 
steps and to guarantee all human rights as well as territorial 
self-government to the Serb ethnic community in the Knin area, 
the Glina and Knin districts where before the war, according to 
the 1991 census, the Serb population was in the majority. 
  Let me add that I listened with a great deal of satisfaction 
to almost all the members of the UN Security Council who 
reiterated the support of their governments for the territorial 
integrity of the internationally recognized borders of Croatia 
and their readiness to define in future UNPROFOR's mandate so 
that, as I said, it can carry out its task. Without a solution 
of the UN-protected zones in Croatia, there can be no stable, no 
final peace in Bosnia- Herzegovina. By signing the Washington 
agreement we took a huge step toward peace, but this is also why 
the question of the UN-protected zones in Croatia should also be 
resolved. Thank you.

  [Text] Warsaw, 24 Mar--President Lech Walesa said today 
that Polish-Hungarian cooperation in opening the borders and 
introducing a market economy was "logical and indispensable." 
Assessing relations between both states, Walesa said that "it 
is not so good that it could not be better." 
  The president granted an interview to representatives of the 
Hungarian media in connection with an official visit to Poland 
by Hungarian President Arpad Goncz, which starts on Monday [28 
March]. 
  "I am going to call for jointly encouraging our governments 
and businessmen for greater cooperation; this has to be 
strengthened, and the visit is to serve this purpose," the 
president said when asked what he expected from Goncz's visit. 
  Walesa did not rule out an increase in military cooperation 
between Poland and Hungary. "We cannot build any kind of third 
structure because neither the West nor Russia would be happy 
about it, but we have to say that, if our freedom and 
sovereignty are in danger, we will fight. There is no free 
Poland without a free Hungary," the president said. 
  Asked to comment on his conflicts with parliament and on 
prospects of the present Sejm, the president said: "Such 
conflicts will always exist until we stabilize our political 
systems. The previous parliaments did not live through their 
full terms of office. If the public is satisfied with the 
present parliament, it will survive."

  [Text] Willy Claes, Belgian deputy prime minister and 
minister of foreign affairs, has arrived in Tirana for an 
official visit. The official talks started at the Foreign 
Ministry with Minister Serreqi. At 1200 Claes was received in a 
special meeting by President Berisha. The Belgian delegation 
will continue its meetings in the following hours with Prime 
Minister Meksi, Minister Zhulali, and Bank Governor General 
Vrioni. Our correspondent reports on the talks held at the 
Foreign Ministry: 
  [Koleci] Willy Claes, Belgian deputy prime minister and 
minister of foreign affairs, arrived in Tirana today for a 
one-day visit. He was received at Rinas airport by Albanian 
Foreign Minister Serreqi. 
  The chief of Belgian diplomacy told the reporters that the 
aim of his visit is the establishment of a continuous political 
dialogue for the interests of both countries. As topics in the 
Albanian-Belgian talks he considered bilateral cooperation as 
well as the situation in our region. 
  After arriving at the Foreign Ministry, the two delegations 
led by Serreqi and Claes started talks. Regarding bilateral 
cooperation, the talks focused on the possibilities of 
institutionalizing the consultations between the two respective 
Foreign Ministries. Regarding economics, the Albanian side paid 
attention to starting cooperation in the mining, energy, 
tourism, agriculture, and textile industries. Minister Serreqi 
presented the desire that Belgian investors be present in 
Albania, assuring the necessary judicial cadre. They also 
expressed opinions on cooperation in the fields of defense and 
public order. 
  Another topic in the talks between the Belgian and Albanian 
delegations was the situation in the region. The main 
protagonists at the meeting supported the U.S. initiative to 
create a Croat-Bosnian federation and Claes stressed the need to 
find proper ways to do so. For this, he continued, it is 
necessary for the Serbian side to contribute as well. 
  The Belgian foreign minister considered the problem of 
Kosova 
as part of the general Yugoslav crisis and tied the abolishment 
of sanctions to the solution of all aspects of the crisis, 
including Kosova. 
  Our foreign minister was of the opinion that Kosova should 
not be treated as a part of Serbia.

  [Text] President Berisha today received Belgian Foreign 
Minister Willy Claes. I am happy to receive you in Albania, 
President Berisha told Willy Claes. I am sure that your visit 
marks an important event in strengthening bilateral relations. 
I would like to mention here the fruitful meetings I held in 
Brussels with His Majesty King Albert I and Belgian Prime 
Minister Dehaene, and the understanding I found in them 
regarding the problems of bilateral relations and those of our 
region. 
  President Berisha made a broad presentation of the 
application and course of the reforms in the political, 
institutional, and economic fields, as well as the latest 
achievements in this direction. We are grateful to the European 
Union [EU] and Belgium for the assistance they rendered to 
Albania. However, Albania still needs assistance and increased 
cooperation with Belgium and European Union. He asked Belgian 
Foreign Minister Claes for the Belgian Kingdom to support the 
processes of Albania's integration into the European Union. 
  Regarding the situation in the region, Berisha stressed once 
again that, with its actions and attitudes, Albania is seriously 
working to achieve stability in the region. He said, however, 
that lifting or facilitating sanctions against Serbia not only 
does not stop the war but moves it toward the south, where it 
threatens to turn into a Balkan conflict. In this framework, it 
comes out clearly that the problem of Kosova remains a regional 
problem, the solution of which is a condition for regional peace 
and stability. That is why this question must be placed on the 
agenda. The European Union should consider the efforts of 
Albanians for a democratic solution. 
  Regarding Kosova as a Serb problem means ignoring 2 million 
Albanians and increasing the chances of conflict. We ask that 
it is necessary to be understood that Greater Serbia is a factor 
of war and instability in the region. I am of the opinion that 
the situation in Kosova is continuously becoming worse. By 
closing the last institutions of culture in conformity with the 
memorandum of the Serbian Academy, Milosevic is escalating the 
terror there. 
  Berisha continued by saying that, in the same way, Albania 
is 
interested in stability in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. However, there are others who 
try to destabilize the situation in this Republic and find and 
create destabilizing factors there where they do not exist. But 
of course, it supports and defends the human and national rights 
of the Albanians in this Republic because this is the only way 
to achieve stability there. 
  Claes said that we feel it is our duty to help and support 
you in the difficult road of reforms. We appraise your 
achievements and guarantee you that Belgium will support 
Albania's efforts to be integrated into the European Union, the 
West European Union, and all European structures. He also 
expressed complete understanding for the problems in the region 
and assessed Albania's stance as a factor and stability. He 
assured President Berisha that Belgium will give a concrete 
contribution in the resolution of the question of Kosova.

  [Text] In a reception today hosted for Belgian Foreign 
Minister Willy Claes, Defense Minister Safet Zhulali described 
Albania's democratic developments and the reformation of the 
army according to the most advanced standards of its integration 
into democratic society, stressing that Albania was the first to 
request NATO membership and aspires to it. Albania is 
cooperating with NATO and fully supports it, offering air and 
port facilities. Albania also supported its ultimatum and 
signed the Partnership for Peace agreement, participating as a 
serious and active partner. 
  Zhulali stressed the need for signing a bilateral agreement, 
which was welcomed by the Belgian foreign minister. In this 
framework, Zhulali said that the Albanian Army can be further 
supported by NATO member countries and Belgium in the field of 
education, training and preparation, material assistance, etc. 
  After assessing the economic and political progress in 
Albania, Belgian Foreign Minister Claes assured Zhulali that all 
West European institutions are ready to support the democratic 
process in Albania. Conveying greetings for Albania's 
participation in the Partnership for Peace agreement and 
cooperation with the Western European Union, Claes expressed a 
readiness for bilateral relations, stressing the possibility of 
direct contacts between the defense ministers. 
  Focusing on regional problems, both welcomed the progress 
achieved in the peace process, confirming that there cannot be a 
solution to the problems in the former Yugoslavia without 
resolving the Kosova problem. 
  We are interested in developing bilateral relations in all 
fields with reciprocal interest, Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi 
said to Claes at the beginning of the meeting. Albania wants to 
be integrated into Europe, not as a burden but by progressing 
forward with your assistance. That is why we are open to 
Belgian investments, especially in infrastructure and 
communication. At the same time, Belgium can support Albania 
economically and politically, even in the framework of the 
European Union [EU] by assisting with an associate agreement. 
  Belgium is willing to cooperate on a multilateral basis, 
Claes said. I think that lifting the double taxation and 
protection of investments will be a good step in this direction. 
I would simultaneously insist to Mr. Delors to undertake 
concrete initiatives to sign an associate agreement with the 
European Union. Claes expressed his support for other 
initiatives in the fields of education and science. 
  In his meeting with Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, 
National Bank Governor Dylber Vrioni expressed a desire to 
cooperate in the financial field as well and negotiate the debt 
that Albania owes to Belgium. 
  Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes also held a meeting 
with 
members of the parliamentary Foreign Policy Commission. They 
mainly discussed Balkan issues and the opportunities for 
cooperation between our two parliaments. 
  Before his departure Claes and Serreqi gave a news 
conference 
in which both personalities assessed the bilateral talks and 
their results. The two officials also answered correspondents' 
questions, which focused on Belgian and Albanian attitudes 
toward a solution to the Kosova question in the framework of the 
crisis in the former Yugoslavia.

voice of protest over the arrest by Serbian police of Kosovar 
publicist and writer Shuaip Beqiri, who is also editor-in-chief 
of the weekly independent FORUMI, which is published in 
Prishtina. 
  The KShH appeals to international institutions to seriously 
assess the dangerous escalation of violence in Kosova, as this 
escalation foreshadows new tragedies that can happen in the 
Balkans and the wider region.

Rosati's candidacy for the post of deputy prime minister and 
finance minister, which was put forward to him by Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak. The meeting between the president and the prime 
minister in the Belweder ended an hour ago. 
  [Reporter Piotr Jazwinski] The Belweder talks lasted less 
than 30 minutes. The prime minister presented the president 
with the motion to appoint Dariusz Rosati to the post of deputy 
prime minister and finance minister and a request to accept it. 
The president did not accept this candidacy because, as 
[presidential spokesman] Minister Andrzej Drzycimski explained, 
it created a double risk. 
  [Begin Andrzej Drzycimski recording] Mr. Dariusz Rosati may 
not sufficiently know the Polish realities. After all, his 
three years' absence from Poland does play an enormous role in 
these processes and the changes we were implementing, and this 
may make making difficult economic decision even more difficult. 
Also, too much may depend on secondhand information. 
  And the second thing, the second risk that the president 
raised was the Foreign Debt Servicing Fund [FOZZ] case. The 
legal situation has not been completed yet. The investigation is 
going on, although there are statements by the justice minister. 
Nonetheless, the case is still being investigated, and there may 
be unnecessary connections in such a difficult situation we find 
ourselves in. [end recording] 
  Dariusz Rosati was on the FOZZ Supervisory Board. Minister 
Drzycimski passed over in silence the question as to whether the 
failure to accept Rosati's candidacy would start a war between 
the Belweder and the Democratic Left Alliance. He added that 
the question of the president's signature on the Budget Law was 
still open. [video shows Walesa entering a hall and meeting

"Crises in the Coalition; Pawlak Wins"] 
  [Text] The prime minister is delaying the decision 
concerning Rosati. Politicians of the Democratic Left Alliance 
[SLD], who unofficially do not conceal their anger, officially 
say: Nothing has happened. "Nothing has happened," they said 
when the establishment of the government was being decided, when 
the prime minister had accepted Borowski's resignation. 
  It took the SLD a long time to find a successor to Borowski. 
When it finally... 
<H5>  Found Dariusz Rosati </H5>
  ...it started to demand that the prime minister accept him 
immediately. 
  Why is Pawlak delaying his decision? One reason has been 
given officially: He wants to familiarize himself with Rosati's 
views on the economy; he wants to be certain that there will be 
no conflicts between him and the "economic" ministers of the 
Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. Other reasons are mentioned only 
unofficially. Pawlak is afraid to employ such a high-ranking 
politician, who will be making better impressions in the mass 
media, especially on television. Before forwarding the 
appointment to the president, the prime minister also wants to 
explain the nature of Rosati's connections with the financial 
affair of the Foreign Debt Service Fund. He knows that, until 
he does that, the president will not take on the responsibility 
for this appointment. 
<H5>  The Result: One to One </H5>
  In the games played so far in the coalition, the SLD won one 
point by forcing Pawlak to change the minister candidate lists 
when the government was being formed. The PSL scored one point 
as well--in the February conflict between Borowski and Pawlak. 
  The first serious crisis shook the coalition even before the 
government was formed. The SLD threatened that, unless the 
names on the list of the Cabinet members submitted to the prime 
minister were different from earlier joint agreements, it would 
leave the coalition. Pawlak had to make a concession and agree 
to sign the appendix to the coalition agreement. 
  The beginning of the next crisis was the issue of the 
privatization of Bank Slaski. Deputy Prime Minister Borowski 
took on responsibility for it. Despite that, the prime minister 
recalled, without Borowski's consent, Finance Deputy Minister 
Kawalec, which forced Borowski and the SLD to submit certain 
conditions to the prime minister. As a result of their 
rejection, Borowski handed in his resignation, which, to the 
surprise of SLD politicians, was accepted by Pawlak. 
  Borowski's issue revealed... 
<H5>  Still Other Controversies </H5>
  ...different views on the pace of privatization and on the 
budget (the prime minister announced on television prosocial 
amendments to the budget, but, on the following day, as PSL 
leader, he agreed to support the government's version of the 
budget). 
  The government's information policy has become a steady 
source of controversy. The SLD has demanded all along that a 
government spokesperson be appointed; it has become increasingly 
critical of Press Secretary Ewa Wachowicz. Quite recently, SLD 
politicians have stated that the decision concerning the 
appointment of a spokesperson has already been made, but it is 
still not clear who will be appointed to this post. 
  The recent declaration by Minister Michal Strak that the 
replacement of voivodes has already been completed may finally 
end the coalition's disagreements concerning the filling of 
these posts. 
  There was no observance of the principle that the post of 
the voivode is filled by a candidate of the party that has won 
the elections in the given district. In February, out of 30 
appointments to the posts of voivodes and deputy voivodes, only 
eight candidates were recommended by the SLD (one of them is a 
member of the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic), and 22 
were proposed by the PSL. As a consequence, the SLD demanded... 
<H5>  That the Role of Minister Strak Be Limited </H5>
  ...and that their representative be employed in the Office 
of 
the Council of Ministers, who would exert influence on the 
appointment of voivodes. 
  For several months now, the SLD has been making efforts to 
appoint its own people to deputy ministerial posts in the 
"presidential" ministries: the Ministry of National Defense 
[MON], the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MSW], and the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs [MSZ]. The bits of information that leak 
from the meetings between Aleksander Kwasniewski and Waldemar 
Pawlak suggest that the prime minister hears out the demands of 
the SLD head and then changes the subject of the meeting. He is 
said to have promised several times that he would take care of 
the issue. Most often his response is silence. 
  Pawlak is keeping Kwasniewski in suspense, he is delaying 
his 
decision; he... 
<H5>  Never Told Him "No," Though </H5>
  ...as far as the issue of deputy ministers was concerned, 
this is why it has not turned into an open conflict in the 
coalition. 
  The prime minister put off the decision, waiting for the 
Belweder to soften its negative stand. This tactic proved 
effective. The MSZ and MSW heads declared that they were ready 
to give deputy ministerial posts to the coalition; recently, the 
MON head agreed to that, too. Not long ago, he even threatened 
to submit his resignation if he was going to have a "party 
activist" in his ministry. 
  The closer the moment of the appointment of SLD Spokesman 
Zbigniew Siemiatkowski to be deputy minister of MON, the more 
quietly the SLD is protesting Jerzy Milewski's merging his 
positions in the National Security Office and in MON. Before 
that, National Defense Committee Head Jerzy Szmajdzinski of the 
SLD even went so far as to threaten the prime minister: He gave 
him several hours to say which function Jerzy Milewski was 
supposed to fulfill. 
  It is to the president's advantage that, in the coalition 
conflicts, Prime Minister Pawlak, rather than the SLD head, gain 
the upper hand. Walesa sometimes... 
<H5>  Discreetly Supports Pawlak... </H5>
  which happened, for example, when he immediately signed 
Borowski's resignation. However, he does not allow the prime 
minister to triumph where he may triumph himself. This is why 
he took advantage of Pawlak's visit to Moscow. 
  All things seem to suggest that, no matter whether Rosati is 
appointed to the post of deputy prime minister and finance 
minister, Pawlak's position, in relation to the SLD, will be 
strengthened. The prime minister wins again because, by 
delaying the decision, he again places the SLD in the position 
of petitioner. Once again he gives everyone to understand that 
coalition agreements are only coalition agreements, appendixes 
are merely appendixes, but, in fact, everything is decided by 
him. Remaining silent and delaying decisions are the main 
methods employed by the prime minister. This is accompanied by 
obstinacy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wieslaw Kaczmarek, minister for ownership </F>
transformations, by Grazyna Saniewska; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Excerpt] [Saniewska] Minister, what was the 
subject of your talks with representatives of the Jelfa work 
force during your visit to Wroclaw? 
  [Kaczmarek] I was asked whether the issue of the free shares 
that the Jelfa work force is supposed to receive will reflect 
the value of the input of effort contributed by the employees to 
the development of that prosperous firm--also, whether the 
minister has the official power to bypass regulations that are 
binding for everyone else. It was suggested that I award 15 
percent of Jelfa shares free to the work force, or recommend 
that the Council of Ministers do so. In addition, the employees 
expressed their wish to buy a further 5 percent of their firm's 
shares. However, during quite blunt talks that we held with the 
firm's representatives, I refused to endorse such a procedure. 
This is because I believe that the allocation of shares to the 
work force should be decided within the firm on the basis of its 
statute. Jelfa's trade unionists tried to persuade me to agree 
to different solutions, which depart from the regulations 
currently in force. 
  [Saniewska] But there is no shortage of examples throughout 
the country that prove that exceptions are being made to the 
rule. Why should Jelfa or Polifarb Wroclaw not set another 
precedent? 
  [Kaczmarek] There have indeed been several precedents, 
notably Kwidzyn, Gorazdze, Polifarb Cieszyn, and Tonsil. I am 
familiar with the last case from my own experience. I was 
obliged to buy out the promissory note drafted by my 
predecessor. There, the work force was not able to take 
advantage of the chance to buy their own company's shares on the 
same principles that had been enjoyed by the employees of the 
first five joint-stock companies to be floated on the stock 
market. There have been quite enough of these precedents, and I 
have no intention of bypassing the regulations set out in 
relevant parliamentary acts. The only cases where decisions to 
do so can be made at all must be truly exceptional, and I do not 
find such a situation at Jelfa--or in other enterprises whose 
work forces desire to make a major killing on the stock market 
in connection with the current boom. They want to grab as many 
shares for themselves as they can, at the lowest prices. 
However, such an attitude is very selfish when you consider the 
possibilities open to employees of the budget-funded sector, old 
age and disability pensioners, or the learned professions. I 
would not like to contribute to deepening divisions over 
privatization in our society. On the other hand, I intend to 
alleviate the effect of certain phenomena connected, for 
example, with purchases of company shares. That is why, in 
Jelfa's case, we intend to try out a different form of selling 
shares in public flotation. So we can avoid share "touts" and 
other irregularities and minimize the risk of going wrong with 
the selling prices of shares. 
  [Saniewska] Do you have plans to privatize our copper 
industry? 
  [Kaczmarek] This problem should be viewed from the 
perspective of at least 20 years and in terms of an eventual 
exhaustion of copper ore. This is because we must be prepared 
to bring in alternative solutions to compensate for the 
exhaustion of the raw material, so that we can at least make use 
of the infrastructure we have created there, including the 
copper-metallurgy sector and the entire 
copper-product-processing industry. All of this must be 
carefully planned so that, in case of economic disaster, that 
whole monoindustrial sector does not collapse into the sort of 
mess we already have in Mielec and Walbrzych. For the time 
being, we do not intend to privatize the copper plant, and, even 
more emphatically, we will not privatize its core element--that 
is, the integrated technological complex of mines and smelting 
plants. On the other hand, it might be that we will privatize 
the infrastructure and the firms constituting backup facilities 
for the whole complex. In turn, the main elements of the whole 
complex require a throrough restructuring to enable its 
particular components to talk the same financial language, so 
that it should be possible to prepare a detailed costs analysis 
of the whole enterprise. After all, it is the cost structure in 
the whole sector that will ultimately decide whether we can 
adjust to world prices and whether our copper plants do not lose 
in competition with their rivals. 
  [Saniewska] What do you think of the concept of placing 
parliament members hailing from parties that form the government 
coalition on the board of directors of the copper corporation? 
  [Kaczmarek] I feel bad about it. This is because I am 
forced to apologize for the fact that our coalition members have 
not withdrawn from their respective offices in the corporation. 
All of the other parliament members have done so because the 
law obliges them to do it. Only two of our own colleagues have 
not resigned, on the excuse that board members can be recalled 
only at a general meeting. Such a position does not become a 
member of parliament. Instead of engaging their energies in the 
cause of helping the copper sector, they are trying to create 
another source of possible unrest around themselves. Neither 
Sejm deputies nor senators are permitted to sit on boards of 
directors or hold office in joint-stock companies. And 
ministers are obliged to uphold these laws. That is why I 
consulted the Sejm and Senate speakers over this matter. 
  [Saniewska] Among the privatization guidelines approved by 
the Sejm, there is a provision stating that a joint-stock 
company owned by its work force can be set up only if no other, 
more advantageous offer has been received by the enterprise. 
Does this clause not give officials too many opportunities for 
arbitrary decisions? And is it not an attempt to undermine the 
emerging joint "employee-owned" companies? 
  [Kaczmarek] It is certainly not such an attempt because 
joint employee-owned companies have dominated our privatization 
scene. To every 1,000 of such companies, there are only 100 
joint capital companies--that is, joint ventures with a 
strategic investor. The provision you mentioned should serve as 
a signal announcing the official state strategy. That strategy 
must pay priority attention to such elements as investors, 
minimum prices, and social benefit packages. When all of these 
factors are taken into consideration, employee-owned companies 
invariably lose out to solutions suggested by strategic 
investors. That is why, in our work on the the Enterprise 
Privatization Act, we intend to narrow somewhat the range of 
firms in which employees could set up their own joint-stock 
companies. They should be set up in enterprises whose work 
forces are not larger than 400 and whose annual turnover is 
lower than 12 million ECU's. Such preconditions are necessary 
if we are to avoid situations similar to that of Winiary, where 
a profitable firm could have been owned by a larger group of 
shareholders. From the viewpoint of its optimum development 
strategy, Winiary needs an aggressive investor. Why should we 
sell it to a group of employees? After all, in matters of 
privatization, we must not be guided by short-term tactics 
designed to soothe the moods of the public. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Wieslawa Wlodarczyk-Wardacka, director of </F>
the Ministry of Ownership Transformations Szczecin Agency, by 
Pawel Winiarski; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Winiarski] Ownership transformations give rise to 
many emotions and misunderstandings. What is more, some people 
are beginning to say that the privatization process is too slow 
and inefficient. Are these allegations true? 
  [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] First of all, the Ministry of 
Ownership Transformations has no power to exert any kind of 
pressure on state enterprises to force them to choose the 
privatization path sooner rather than later. Nor does it have 
any interest in doing so. The decision rests first and foremost 
with the work forces of the firms in question. On the other 
hand, more than half of all enterprises in Poland are currently 
in the process of various kinds of ownership transformations. 
These processes include liquidation, restructuring, completion 
of privatization schemes, bankruptcy procedures, and transfer of 
the assets of certain firms into the administration of the State 
Treasury Agricultural Property Agency. 
  [Winiarski] How does Szczecin Voivodship rate against the 
background of your statistics? 
  [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] Unfortunately, our region is hardly up 
with the national leaders. This is because 
ownership-transformation processes are being carried out at no 
more than just over 20 percent of firms that were originally set 
up by the voivoda or by central administration agencies. Even 
so, whereas we note relatively significant progress in the 
latter category, the group of enterprises dubbed "voivoda's 
firms" represents a minor proportion of enterprises currently 
undergoing privatization in the region. Since the beginning of 
1991, transformation operations have been initiated at 71 firms, 
including 44 from the voivoda's "stable" and 27 administered 
centrally. Only one-third of the total number have actually 
been privatized. A dozen or so collapsed, and the rest were 
liquidated because of their poor financial condition. Four 
firms were sold to individual private investors, and several 
more entered joint-stock companies based on foreign capital. 
All in all, out of the total of 211 state enterprises, 95 were 
not included in any ownership-transformation processes at all. 
Just under one-third of all of the enterprises were transferred 
to the administration of the State Treasury Agricultural 
Property Agency. 
  [Winiarski] What form of privatization is currently most 
popular with work forces? 
  [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] The most popular privatization model 
at present is leasing. Almost 75 percent of firms undergoing 
privatization choose that particular option. The decisive 
factors here are work forces' desire to become joint owners of 
the assets of their own enterprises, accompanied by mistrust of 
any new outside owners. We currently note a dangerous 
phenomenon whereby economic analyses are commissioned "to order" 
by enterprises from outside "consultancy firms." Instead of 
telling the truth, which is frequently brutal, they go out of 
their way to prove the correctness of the firms' choice of this 
or that particular privatization model. This might later turn 
out to be a very dangerous practice when it becomes apparent 
that the firm is unable to meet market demands and has no funds 
with which to meet the lease payments. We have such a situation 
now with the Regional Land Reclamation Enterprise, whose 
financial condition brings into question the original decision 
to privatize it in the leasing system. 
  [Winiarski] But surely someone must have approved that 
original decision.... 
  [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] Our agency notified the ministry of a 
number of reservations about the documents we were presented 
with at the time, but the work force's determination eventually 
persuaded the minister to make that decision. Our agency has 
relatively limited powers of intervention in 
ownership-transformation processes. We are merely an 
opinion-formulating organ, and we vet documents from the formal 
and legal angles. Of course, we can formulate a negative 
opinion, but that does not necessarily mean that a determined 
firm will not be able to have its way. 
  [Winiarski] A new type of ownership transformation is being 
introduced now, in the shape of the National Investment Funds. 
Is this form of privatization attracting much interest? 
  [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] In 1992, when the project was first 
announced, three firms expressed an interest. Last year, 
another five firms joined them. At the moment, talks are under 
way with several more candidates eager to participate in this 
form of privatization. These are not impressive numbers, but 
that is also because a considerable number of firms are still 
poorly informed about the details of this new venture. 
  [Winiarski] How would you assess the present condition of 
the privatization scene in Szczecin Voivodship? 
  [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] A measure of comfort may be derived 
from the fact that, for example, last year the Szczecin voivoda 
did not have to make even a single decision to liquidate an 
enterprise on grounds of poor economic condition. However, this 
does not mean that there are no such firms at all. There are, 
but they are making every effort to survive. In many cases, it 
is obvious that administration by a board of commissioners would 
be an insufficient rescue measure that would only serve to 
prolong their slow death even more. Liquidation processes 
designed to precede privatization have been carried out 
successfully in seven firms. This may not be much, but it is 
still the best result we have noted over the past three years. 
However, on the whole, there is still too little activity in a 
significant number of enterprises that ought to be restructured. 
Szczecin Voivodship is a region with a somewhat exceptional 
structure. Huge areas are still in the hands of the State 
Farms, and, in these, privatization is proceeding very 
sluggishly. There are also a considerable number of enterprises 
whose privatization would require truly long periods of time and 
really comprehensive economic analyses. Nevertheless, even 
those processes could and should be speeded up a little. The 
trouble is that it is not within our sphere of competence to do 
the speeding up. A proportion of enterprises should be 
liquidated and sold as soon as possible. This is because they 
survive not by carrying out their statutory duties but, for 
instance, by subletting the land and the property they 
administer. On the face of it, their financial situation 
appears not too bad, but the State Treasury could still gain a 
lot by privatizing those firms. The phenomenon is rather 
widespread, and it should be opposed by individual enterprises' 
respective founding agencies. For the time being, any such 
opposition is not making many inroads. However, the reluctance 
to make appropriate decisions is also underpinned by the fear of 
inflation and can be seen as partly justified. Nevertheless, the 
time for radical decisions will be coming soon.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Creating Prerequisites for a Loan; </F>
Washington Is Interested in the Ability of the Provisional 
Government of the Slovak Republic To Function"] 
  [Text] Washington--"The U.S. side inquired whether there 
would be consensus in the new Slovak Government among all the 
political parties that participated in its formation and whether 
there are not any differences of principle among them that might 
jeopardize its ability to function," Deputy Prime Minister 
Brigita Schmognerova told the TA SR correspondent after her 
talks with Alexander Vershobow, U.S. deputy assistant secretary 
of state for Europe. 
  According to her words, Alexander Vershobow expressed 
satisfaction with Prime Minister Moravcik's statement that the 
government would strive to calm down the political situation and 
with the government's determination to pursue a positive policy 
toward minorities. 
  The talks were also attended by Ralph Johnson, coordinator 
of 
U.S. assistance to the countries of Central and East Europe. The 
two representatives voiced apprehension lest the interim nature 
of the present government unfavorably influence the government's 
economic policy and economic life become excessively 
politicized, especially during the election campaign. 
  The Slovak deputy prime minister replied to this that the 
future government would undoubtedly be a coalition one and that 
some and, possibly, even all of the current coalition parties 
would probably participate in its formation. Therefore, it 
would be shortsighted of them to misuse economic power for their 
own political aims because they would have to bear the 
consequences for this after the elections. "This line of 
argumentation convinced the U.S. side," Schmognerova said. 
  The subject of Brigita Schmognerova's talks with IMF 
Executive Director William Kieckens was the extension of a 
so-called standby credit to the Slovak Republic to reinforce its 
foreign-exchange reserves. The extension of the credit would at 
the same time be an expression of trust in [the government's] 
economic policy and an important signal for other financial 
institutions. 
  According to Brigita Schmognerova, during its February visit 
to Slovakia, an IMF mission arrived at the conclusion that the 
fulfillment of one of the indicators for the provision of the 
credit--that the [budget] deficit not exceed 4 percent of gross 
domestic product--will be very difficult to achieve. It did not 
content itself with the previous government's assurances that 
this indicator would be achieved by tightening discipline 
regarding expenditures and proposed additional measures to meet 
this indicator, which, however, the previous government did not 
have time to approve. 
  Brigita Schmognerova did not tell the TA SR correspondent 
that specific measures had been proposed. She only said that 
one part concerns the solution of the deficit and another the 
monetary program of the Slovak National Bank. 
  "During the talks, we reached the conclusion that it is 
exceptionally important to achieve those indicators. If we are 
able to fulfill them by other measures [than those proposed by 
the IMF mission], however, the IMF will essentially accept 
that," Schmognerova said.

Bratislava. 
  [Nagy] For Slovakia, its relationships with the Czech 
Republic and Hungary are most important in the Central European 
region, at present. The latter is so in spite of the fact that 
it is not as we would like it to be, Eduard Kukan, Slovak 
foreign minister, told a Hungarian radio correspondent today. 
Then he continued as follows: 
  [Kukan, in Slovak, fading into Nagy's report in Hungarian] 
The outside world views this region in which we live, Central 
Europe, through the prism of Slovak-Hungarian relations. It is 
in the interest of the international organizations--and the 
minister was convinced of this as UN ambassador--to stabilize 
this relationship, so that the number of sources of tension in 
the world does not increase, so that this region does not 
constitute a serious problem for the international organizations. 
  The current Slovak Government observed with pleasure that 
its 
first statements, by which it would like primarily to encourage 
the Hungarian side to start a dialogue, were received favorably 
by its Hungarian counterparts, the foreign minister said. 
  To my question of whether the start of a dialogue could take 
place in April, Kukan replied that no decision had been reached 
on this yet, but a relationship ought to be developed between 
the two neighboring countries, regardless of the governments 
that happen to be in power. The Hungarian elections are the 
country's internal affair, and the people have the right to 
decide what kind of government they want. 
  The Slovak Government, regardless of what Hungary's new 
leadership will be like, would like to shape the two countries' 
relationship so that this leads to a solution of the existing 
questions, Kukan told the correspondent of Hungarian radio.

<F P=106> ["Open letter" from Jozef Prokes, deputy to the National </F>
Council of the Slovak Republic for the Slovak National Party and 
deputy prime minister in Vladimir Meciar's outgoing government, 
to President Michal Kovac; place and date not given: "Weapon 
Against Democracy"] 
  [Text] Your Excellency, allow me, first of all, to 
congratulate you on the attainment of the presidential system 
and on the manner in which Your Excellency brought it about. 
  I found the permanent accusations of Meciar wanting to 
install a presidential system suspicious from the very start, as 
he was not the president. Logic clearly tells one that he would 
be against himself. But who is asking for logic! Anyone 
assaults logic nowadays. Am I not right, Your Excellency? 
  Or do you think that the ruling by the Constitutional Court 
of the Slovak Republic concerning interpretation of Article 111 
of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic--I quote: "The 
president of the Slovak Republic appoints and recalls other 
members of the government at the proposal of the prime 
minister...."--that the president need not accept the prime 
minister's proposal, and interpretation of Article 87, section 
2--I quote: "Laws passed by the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic [NRSR] are signed by the NRSR chairman, the president 
of the Slovak Republic, and the prime minister of the Slovak 
Republic"--that the prime minister is obliged to sign a law 
after its second approval in the NRSR, is in conformity with 
logic? The diction in both instances is the same. Or is this 
contradictory interpretation by the Constitutional Court due 
only to ignorance of the Slovak language? 
  Let us return, however, Your Excellency, to the 
Constitutional Court's ruling on Article 111 of the Constitution 
of the Slovak Republic that Your Excellency need not accept the 
prime minister's proposals for the appointment of other 
government members. This is fabulous! Now and in the future, 
Your Excellency can completely ignore election results. Your 
Excellency will simply refuse to appoint a minister as long as 
the new prime minister will not propose to you the "right" one, 
selected by Your Excellency. 
  Incidentally, why should you not also choose a prime 
minister 
who is to your liking? Nowhere in the Constitution of the 
Slovak Republic is it written that anyone has the right to 
propose to Your Excellency a prime minister, let alone that Your 
Excellency would have to accept such a proposal. It is only a 
good custom in democracies that candidates for government 
members are nominated by the political entity that had won the 
elections and that the president accepts these candidates. But 
why should you let yourself be guided by this? After all, it is 
only a custom from something called democracy. Who cares about 
citizens' will? One need not worry one's head about that. 
  As a matter of fact, even though, according to Article 102, 
letter (f) of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, you 
appoint and recall the prime minister and other members of the 
government, it is not written there that you must appoint a 
prime minister. Why not try it out? Following the ruling by 
the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic on Article 111 
of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, I would not be 
surprised at all if the Constitutional Court of the Slovak 
Republic arrived at the conclusion that you need not appoint a 
prime minister. 
  Let us return, however, to the gratifying possibility of 
ignoring election results, which the Constitutional Court of the 
Slovak Republic placed in your hands. Should the election 
winner disagree with the government selected by Your Excellency 
and NRSR deputies refuse to approve its policy statement, you 
will simply send them home, under Article 102, letter (d) of the 
Constitution of the Slovak Republic, and will dissolve 
parliament. Even though the Constitution states that the NRSR 
chairman will call new elections within 30 days, it is not 
written there that he must do so. The devil knows how the 
Constitutional Court would decide. Does he have to? Does he not 
have to? Must he not? 
  Does Your Excellency realize those amazing possibilities? A 
single ruling by the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic 
managed to turn the entire system of power upside down. A 
parliamentary system has been transformed into a presidential 
one! Article 102, letter (d), whose original aim was to compel 
the election winner to responsibly approach the government 
formation, has been turned into a dangerous weapon against 
democracy in the hands of Your Excellency. 
  Your Excellency has really pulled it off. Let me 
congratulate you once again. I always knew that one should not 
forget popular wisdom. The one, for example, about the thief 
shouting catch the thief. 
  [Signed] Jozef Prokes, NRSR deputy 
  P.S. Does Your Excellency think that the ruling by the 
Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic on Article 111 of 
the Constitution of the Slovak Republic is a consequence of the 
insufficient ability to think logically and to work out in one's 
mind the consequences of one's decisions or that it is the 
result of ignorance of the Slovak language? Or is something 
completely, but completely, different involved? 
  P.P.S. I dared express my opinion. Is that still allowed?

<F P=106> [CTK report: "The Heavy Engineering Works Have Exclusive </F>
Rights to Zuzana"] 
  [Text] Dubnica--A new 155-mm howitzer, code-named 
"Zuzana," designed for ammunition corresponding to NATO 
standards, will be manufactured in the ZTS [Heavy-Engineering 
Works] Dubnica state enterprise during the second half of this 
year. This statement was made yesterday by Peter Koncier, the 
director of ZTS in Dubnica nad Vahom. According to him, the 
howitzer will be introduced commercially following the 
appropriate trials in the second half of this year. ZTS Dubnica 
arranged the development of the Zuzana howitzer in the past; 
therefore, it has the exclusive rights to the results of this 
howitzer's development as opposed to those of the older type, 
Dana, whose modernization is taking place concurrently with the 
development of Zuzana. 
  The project to modernize the Dana howitzer, manufactured 
since 1979 for the unified 152-mm-caliber Warsaw Pact munitions, 
was arranged and financed by the Czechoslovak Army, and the two 
successor armies have a claim to the results of its development. 
  The Zuzana howitzer belongs to the high-tech category, which 
fully corresponds to the highest requirements of the North 
Atlantic Alliance, and could, therefore, also be sold to Western 
armies. Director Koncier emphasized that the development of such 
a specialized system takes many years. The results of the 
development of one system are carried over into the development 
of the other as partial results. He also commented that the 
Germans have announced that they will bring a howitzer similar 
to Zuzana onto the market in 1998. Part of the Zuzana howitzer 
trial series is intended for the Slovak Army, which will support 
Slovak industry.

are our natural partners. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Marta Stolarova on interview with External </F>
Economic Relations Minister Oleh Slyepichev in Prague; date not 
given: "Practical Mechanisms Are Sought for New Revival of 
Mutual Relations"] 
  [Text] "It is delightful that, despite all of the crisis 
economic phenomena and our passing through a complex period of 
transformation, our mutual relations have not significantly 
suffered." Oleh Slyepichev, Ukrainian external economic 
relations minister, stated this in an interview for HOSPODARSKE 
NOVINY following his talks with the Czech economy ministers with 
whom he signed, at the end of last week, treaties on economic 
cooperation and support, and mutual protection of investments. 
  "Because mutual relations used to be centrally controlled, 
we 
are searching for suitable mechanisms for their revival," the 
minister said. That was one of the reasons the two partner 
institutions, the Ukrainian External Economic Relations Ministry 
and the Czech Industry and Trade Ministry, agreed to create a 
mixed, broadly conceived interdepartmental commission, which 
would even include representatives from customs, the banking 
sphere, and so forth, and devote itself to the building of 
mutual relations. 
  The Czech Republic and Ukraine have already prepared a legal 
basis for this, but we cannot avoid some problems in the near 
future. According to the minister, these problems emerge 
particularly in the sphere of payments. The volume of mutual 
trade has markedly declined of late years to reach a current 
turnover value of approximately $200 million. The trade is more 
or less balanced. "We should try to keep up our trade, even 
with the payment difficulties, because there are priorities, 
feasible solutions to the payment difficulties that must be 
sought. I assume that our banks will deal with this in the very 
near future, perhaps in April," Slyepichev emphasized. 
  Of the specific priorities in mutual trade relations, the 
minister pointed to the pressing need for restoration and 
continuous supply of spare parts for the extensive pool of the 
Czech trolleybuses and streetcars in Ukrainian cities. Ukraine, 
for its part, used to supply the Czech Republic with iron ore, 
and it would be difficult to find a replacement for this market. 
"Hence, we are now looking at the possibilities of joint 
enterprise and mutual investments, with the idea of not only 
supplying our two markets but also penetrating third markets," 
the minister emphasized. 
  To a question regarding the financing options for the 
planned 
trade, the minister replied that such options exist--opening 
accounts, clearing, and barter trade. At this time, according 
to him, it is necessary, above all, to create favorable 
conditions for direct cooperation between enterprises, the more 
so because, in certain areas, a little effort could bear fruit 
in a very short time. In this context, Minister Slepichev spoke 
about his talks with the Association for Trade with Ukraine, 
which collects bids for the supply of small bakeries, breweries, 
and meat-industry-processing lines, and seeks contacts for 
Ukrainian buyers. The representatives of the interested sectors 
already agreed to help realize these deals through certain 
mediating activities.

  [Text] Dutch Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans, who has 
joined the delegation of the Netherlands' Queen Beatrix in 
Prague, had talks today with his counterpart, Josef Zieleniec. 
Klara Stejskalova reports: 
  [Stejskalova] The Czech foreign affairs minister welcomed, 
in 
the beginning, the visit of the Netherlands royal couple to our 
country. The two ministers then agreed that mutual relations 
between the Czech Republic and the Netherlands were good. That 
is why questions of multilateral cooperation were the main topic 
of their conversation. 
  They talked, above all, about the European Union [EU], which 
the Czech Republic intends to join in the future. According to 
the two foreign ministers, the EU is currently undergoing 
dramatic moments, as confirmed by the current crisis on the 
question of the lower blocking minority by percent required by 
Britain. The emergent crisis only confirms the need for 
discussion on the future philosophy of the EU. 
  The agenda of the Dutch-Czech talks also included questions 
on the Partnership for Peace program and overall security in 
Europe.

<F P=106> [Article by "(fr)": "The European Bank for Reconstruction </F>
and Development Considers Support for the Financial Sector and 
the Infrastructure To Be Its Priorities"] 
  [Text] Prague--During the past six months, the period in 
which I have been in my new job, I have focussed, among other 
things, on reappraising the bank's medium-term aims, said 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD] 
President Jacques de Larosiere yesterday in a speech to the 
European Banking Forum in Prague. According to him, the new 
regulations should enable the EBRD to fulfill its mandate in the 
best manner possible--that is, by assisting the reform process 
in Central and East Europe. 
  We would like to come closer to the local private sector, to 
focus on support for its development, and to be active in all of 
the countries of the region, said de Larosiere. In his opinion, 
the EBRD should be more involved in the capital inputs into the 
enterprises, and it is also necessary to emphasize the 
significance of the financial sector for the successful course 
of the reforms. Support for the development, first and foremost, 
of private business initiatives in the infrastructure sphere, 
which is the driving force behind an economy's growth, remains a 
priority. 
  In his speech, the president confirmed the EBRD's intention 
to become capitally involved in developing the financial sector 
in Central and East Europe. The bank has already confirmed its 
intention to invest a total of 111 million European Currency 
Units in 11 financial institutions in eight of the region's 
countries. "We were asked by the management of the Czech 
Komercni banka [Commercial Bank] to become involved in 
purchasing some of the shares from the forthcoming issue," said 
de Larosiere. However, in his opinion, it would be a greater 
success for the Czech economy if the entire issue is absorbed by 
the local market. 
  The policy of the European Union [EU] toward the countries 
of 
East Europe in the trade issue should be more liberal since the 
EU's policy still seems too shortsighted and egoistic in this 
respect. This statement was made by former British Chancellor 
of the Exchequer Norman Lamont after he delivered his speech to 
the European Banking Forum. Norman Lamont added that 
enterprises in some postcommunist countries are frequently 
supported less by the state than, for example, Italian or 
Spanish enterprises, and, consequently, this issue should not 
prevent these countries from being admitted into the European 
Union. 
  In his speech to the European Banking Forum, Zdenek Drabek, 
an adviser to the governor of the Czech National Bank, referred 
to the similarity of the measures introduced by the East 
European states in reforming the banking sector. The European 
Banking Forum sessions held at midday and in the afternoon of 
Tuesday [22 March] concentrated on the establishment and 
activity of the East European commercial banks and the issue of 
the influx of foreign capital into the transforming economies.

<F P=106> [Article by "(fr)": "Countries Should Stop Shunning the </F>
Problem of Expansion, Says the EU Vice President"] 
  [Text] "Euro treaties securing the basic economic and 
political dialogue between the European Union [EU] and the 
countries of Central and East Europe should assume a 
multilateral aspect. Treaties between the postcommunist 
countries should be adjusted in the same way," said Henning 
Christophersen, vice president of the European Union, at a 
meeting of the European Banking Forum in Prague yesterday. 
Should the contrary be the case, Europe may find after yet 
another integration that it has to face several hundreds of 
incompatible bilateral treaties. 
  The European Union decided last summer that it would support 
the multilateral aspect of treaties, and the EU foreign 
ministers established that they would invite their Eastern 
colleagues for cooperation. The EU finance ministers also 
arrived at an identical conclusion on Monday evening [21 March], 
Christophersen stressed. 
  Euro treaties are expected to greatly liberalize mutual 
relations, and the establishment of a free trade zone should 
become the main objective before full membership is assumed, the 
vice president added. Despite the needed rapprochement of 
economic policies, the East European countries should not make 
the same mistake as the European Union--that is, introduce a 
vast system of state supports and subsidies. 
  We can see that the European Union is hesitating about its 
expansion, Christophersen said. Questions are being raised 
regarding the pressure exerted by the competitors, the 
decisionmaking process in such a large group, agricultural 
policy, and structural funds [strukturalni fondy]. According to 
him, the countries of Central and East Europe are also 
hesitating to a certain extent. They have to sort out problems 
with meeting EU social and ecological standards, carrying out 
economic conversion, the functioning of democracy, respecting 
minority rights, and introducing the EU legal system. Both 
sides should stop hesitating and avoiding problems, 
Christophersen stressed. According to him, the European Union 
was not established in the 1950's because the member countries 
loved each other but because it was necessary, in view of the 
failure of diplomatic structures.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Suman, chairman of the </F>
parliamentary Defense and Security Committee, by Jaroslav 
Spurny; place and date not given: "I Am Nobody's Friend"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Spurny] Your committee 
and, subsequently, parliament will have to approve the report on 
the security of the state. How do you see security? 
  [Suman] Every state promotes, by means of the government, 
its interests abroad and tries to do what it can to limit what 
we call security risks. Today, however, neither the government 
nor the parliament has the material on which it could assess the 
external and internal security risks of the Czech Republic. 
  Such material is simply indispensable and should specify the 
priorities of the risks mentioned in it. We must decide which 
of them to cover by repression, which by legislative measures, 
and which by organizational steps, and which threaten us in the 
foreseeable future, and so forth. Precisely the fact that no 
such material exists makes it possible for our representatives 
to issue different statements on foreign policy. I believe some 
people are not interested in prioritizing our interests because 
that enables them to present their own personal opinions. I 
believe this to be contrary to the interest of the Czech 
Republic. 
  Regarding the report that is to be prepared, it was 
requested 
by the deputies and is a reaction of the Chamber to the fall 
report by Minister Ruml, which, however, did not report on the 
overall security situation of the Republic but only about the 
domain of the interior minister. We have not yet received an 
overall report, which should be prepared by the interior and the 
defense ministers and BIS [Security Information Service] 
director. 
  [Spurny] What do you believe to be the most critical 
security risks for the Czech Republic? 
  [Suman] I will start with the greatest ones. First, it is 
the development in Russia, where anything can happen. Militant 
nationalism is another danger. If it is proved in former 
Yugoslavia that aggression pays, it will serve as a clear sign 
for other countries in which this nationalism has so far been 
expressed in only a milder form. Organized crime also 
represents a genuine threat. This applies also to internal risks. 
  At home, I see the danger in expressions of racism, in the 
emergence of extremist movements, and, of course, in the 
development of crime, although it is no longer rising as fast as 
in previous years. [passage omitted] 
  [Spurny] Why has the acting head of BIS, Stanislav Devaty, 
not been appointed to the post? 
  [Suman] During the coalition talks, it was agreed which 
party would be given the post of defense minister and that the 
Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA] would give up its claim to this 
post in exchange for another appointment. It was mentioned that 
it could be BIS. Internal security is affected by two 
sectors--Interior and BIS. The ODA and the Christian and 
Democratic Union [KDU] consider it very problematic for a single 
political party to control both these sectors. It is difficult 
for me to speak about it, however, because I was also mentioned 
as a possible candidate for the job. 
  [Spurny] The post of [Interior] Minister Ruml is also 
frequently questioned. Recently, it is particularly the social 
democrats who have focused on this post. 
  [Suman] Before tackling this question, let me explain that, 
although Ruml and I are not friends, our mutual relations have 
always been very courteous. Regarding the demands for his 
recall, I have already explained it once to Mr. Zeman [CSSD 
chairman, who has called for Ruml to be recalled]. The Social 
Democrats [CSSD] speak only about the adverse development of the 
crime rate. I believe the opposition should come up with new 
concepts so the voter can choose from several alternatives. I 
suspect that the conduct of the left wing is purely 
purpose-oriented because the minister is considered a symbol of 
the struggle against the Bolsheviks. That is why the opposition 
is after his head. Jan Ruml is a very impulsive person, who 
sometimes acts in a mercurial way, but, at this time, I do not 
know a single person who would be able to do the job of interior 
minister substantially better than he. 
  [Spurny] What do you think about developments in the Czech 
Army? 
  [Suman] No changes, and personnel changes, in particular, 
affected the Army before the beginning of 1993. Even last 
year's screening did not solve this problem because it, as I 
also believe, fell short of its objective. The assessment was 
often done by people with a very questionable past. 
  I imagined that several of the least untrustworthy officials 
at the highest level would be chosen. These commanders were to 
appoint their subordinates, and, if they chose wrongly, they 
would bear full responsibility. 
  [Spurny] As an economist, Prime Minister Klaus allegedly 
does not attribute such importance to security issues as they 
deserve. 
  [Suman] I do not know the prime minister well enough. I can 
only speak about his opinion concerning the intelligence 
services. I know that it was not easy to convince him of the 
importance of intelligence services. He advocated an 
integration of espionage and counterespionage in both the 
civilian and the military services. For me, a model that could 
lead to a threat to democracy is completely inadmissible. It 
testifies to a not very thorough knowledge of intelligence work. 
A characteristic feature of his personality may have played a 
role here: He came to a certain conclusion and was convinced 
that it was the correct one because it was his opinion. 
  [Spurny] The case of the bugging of Justice Minister Novak 
has not been clarified. What was the reason for the failure? 
  [Suman] The several hours immediately following the 
discovery of the bugs testify to the failure of our professional 
services. This applies, however, only if it was not intentional, 
which I do not expect. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Andre Erdos, Hungarian ambassador to the </F>
United Nations, by Laszlo Gereb; place and date not given: "Our 
International Obligations Are More Important"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The importance of a dialogue 
with Belgrade markedly appears in official statements about 
Hungary's policy toward former Yugoslavia. Does this contradict 
UN policy? 
  [Erdos] Not at all, on the contrary: The political 
settlement requires a dialogue with all sides, irrespective of 
how the international community judges any of the sides morally 
or politically. Generally, I find it extremely important to 
have a rational and consistent Hungarian policy toward our 
neighbors, and I find a courageous initiative quite correct. 
However, let me add that relations with the Serbs seems to be a 
separate issue, because things occurred along our southern 
border and this makes our system of relations there different 
from our relations with Romania, Slovakia, or any other 
neighbors. This does not at all contradict the fact, in terms 
of Hungarian policy regarding the Yugoslav crisis, that it was 
clear from the very beginning that this policy is not against an 
ethnic group, against the Serbian people, but against a certain 
Serbian policy and the means used to implement this policy, 
means repeatedly condemned by the UN Security Council such as 
the forced acquisition of territories, ethnic cleansing, 
barbaric violations of human rights, and the destruction of 
historical and cultural values. 
  I think that both international and specific Hungarian 
viewpoints are equally important in our Yugoslav policy and, in 
the current political context, it would not be desirable to form 
some sort of priority. In other words, we must equally consider 
the future good-neighborly relations with Serbia and the 
viewpoints of the ethnic Hungarians living in Vojvodina as well 
as the principles and behavior norms declared at the London 
conference on the former Yugoslavia and stipulated by the 
obligatory Security Council decisions. We know from our own 
experience that keeping our international obligations is 
directly proportional with the prestige of Hungary's foreign 
policy and the credibility of our positions.

  [Text] Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who is in 
Budapest on an official visit, was briefed this morning about 
the situation of the minorities in Hungary. He then met leaders 
of the three largest opposition parties. Anna Gulyas reports: 
  [Gulyas] We told the prime minister that when judging the 
situation in Hungary it is necessary to consider the fact that, 
bearing in mind that these are the second free, democratic 
elections, neither the politicians nor public opinion have 
really learned the rules of the game, Ivan Petoe, chairman of 
the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], said in a statement 
summing up the discussion. He added: The room for maneuver in 
forming coalitions is influenced by the fact that not only 
rational but very often emotional factors have an impact on the 
parties' coalition plans in Hungary. 
  Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP], 
called the attention of Jean-Luc Dehaene to the fact that the 
European Union should take greater account of the 
characteristics of the region's countries. It would be good if 
Brussels acknowledges the achievements of the states concerned 
-- including those of our country -- in the development of a 
market economy, and if it desists from treating the issue of the 
east-central European countries' accession as one package. 
  In connection with NATO, we accept that the region must be 
treated as a unified whole, Gyula Horn said, adding that during 
the discussion he emphasized the Socialist Party's opinion that 
in Hungary a referendum should precede NATO accession. 
  The Hungarian political parties are committed to membership 
in NATO and the European Union. This was also affirmed by 
Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats 
[Fidesz], at the discussion. 
  In connection with full membership in the European Union, 
the 
Belgian prime minister again highlighted the importance of 
preparation. The extent of this influences the time it takes to 
gain membership.

Crisis. Membership Request on 1 April"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
<H5>  NATO </H5>
  After meeting with his Hungarian counterpart, Prime Minister 
Dehaene emphasized that Hungary's integration is a gradual 
process. This does not only apply to EU membership but also to 
NATO membership. The Partnership for Peace is a first step in 
that direction. 
  During his official contacts, however, the Belgian prime 
minister found out that the Hungarian socialists are not so keen 
on joining NATO. The socialists argue that they are not at all 
sure that the population wants such a membership. 
  In Hungary there has been quite a noise about NATO Air Force 
General Kehoe's statement that NATO's AWACS airplanes operating 
in Hungarian airspace were directly involved in the shooting 
down of four Serbian military airplanes by U.S. airplanes at the 
end of last month. 
  On 11 February Prime Minister Boross had ruled that the 
AWACS 
airplanes would not be allowed to use the Hungarian airspace if 
NATO was going to launch air strikes against Bosnian Serb 
positions around Sarajevo. The prime minister justified this 
unexpected decision by referring, among other things, to the 
difficult situation of the 430,000 or so ethnic Hungarians 
living in the Province of Vojvodina, which is part of Serbia. 
  The problem of the minorities was also one of the issues 
Prime Minister Dehaene brought up in Budapest during his meeting 
with the relevant state secretaries. On 7 July 1993 the 
Hungarian parliament passed a law on national and ethnic 
minorities. According to Dehaene, the law on minorities contains 
clauses which are not applicable to Hungary and is mainly 
intended as a signal to the neighboring countries, including 
Serbia and Montenegro.

<F P=106> [Magdalina Andonova report: "Zhan Videnov Met Montgomery, </F>
Filip Dimitrov --Avdeyev"] 
  [Text] On 18 March Zhan Videnov, leader of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP], met Richard Schiffer from the U.S. 
National Security Council [NSC], Charles Donas, executive 
director of the State Department Group for Central and Eastern 
Europe, William Montgomery, U.S. ambassador to Bulgaria, and 
Helen Walls from the Treasury Department. According to Videnov, 
the participants in the meeting discussed the basic problems of 
our country in the socioeconomic sphere, international financial 
relations, and foreign policy in the Balkans, as well as our 
country's Euroatlantic orientation, an issue on which, according 
to Zhan Videnov, a national consensus exists in Bulgaria. 
  The BSP leader said the following to NOVINI 5 and Khorizont 
Radio reporters: 
  "We think that the United States has precise information 
regarding the situation of the Balkan states today. They may 
underestimate a little the grave economic and social 
difficulties that countries like Bulgaria, which are in a 
process of transition, are encountering. They see the processes 
as much more controllable and prone to subjective political will 
than they really are. The U.S. guests will generate 
contradicting impressions from their meetings with the various 
political forces. However, I think that the BSP has responded 
more adequately to their interest by revealing its ideas about 
the country's socioeconomic development in the next few years." 
  Aleksandr Avdeyev, Russian ambassador to Bulgaria, gave a 
dinner in honor of Filip Dimitrov, leader of the Union of 
Democratic Forces [SDS]. It was a friendly dinner, Mr. Leonid 
Reshetnikov, press attache at the Russian Embassy told the 
BALKAN NEWS AGENCY. Mr. Dimitrov and Mr. Avdeyev exchanged 
information regarding the situation in Russia and Bulgaria. 
Both noted the necessity of developing relations between the 
two countries in all possible directions, something that 
corresponds to the national interests of Bulgaria and Romania. 
  Filip Dimitrov heard with great interest Russia's position 
on 
the situation in the Balkans, and more specifically on the 
Yugoconflict. He and Mr. Avdeyev discussed the necessity of 
reviving diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and Russia. 
  The dinner at the embassy, which lasted two hours, included 
only vegetable dishes, because both Mr. Dimitrov and Mr. Avdeyev 
were observing Lent.

<F P=106> [STANDART NEWS staff report: "Experts Suspect Deliberate </F>
Accidents at Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant"] 
  [Text] At the insistence of National Assembly Deputy Vasil 
Mikhaylov, the parliamentary National Security Commission is 
going to consider the report of experts who investigated the 
circumstances, reasons, and consequences of the accident in 
Generating Units Nos. 5 and 6 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power 
Plant on 22-23 September 1992. 
  The accident occurred when a risky experiment was in 
progress 
in the No. 6 Unit, namely reducing the loading of turbogenerator 
No. 10 down from 100 percent to zero. At the very start of the 
experiment, a short circuit occurred that shut down the standby 
electrical supply to Units Nos. 5 and 6. Only by switching on 
standby diesel generators was it possible to prevent the reactor 
from becoming a bomb. Important control and monitoring 
apparatus remained without any electric power supply, so that 
between 1415 and 1600, no information or recordings were 
available on the actions carried out. The Soviet specialists in 
charge of the experiment refuse to provide any explanation. 
  The experts established that no program existed for the 
experiment or for dealing with any possible incidents that might 
occur. The Central Control Department has no documentation 
either because the tape recorder that serves as a "black box" in 
the event of accidents is started manually, and on the day in 
question, no one thought of switching it on. 
  The failure in the No. 6 Unit put the radiation safety 
monitoring panel out of action. The workers connected all the 
instruments to the standby diesel generators. However, no one 
noted this either in the report compiled by the Kozloduy Nuclear 
Power Plant, nor in the one made by the National Electricity 
Company commission, nor in the report of the Committee for 
Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy because it contravened the 
nuclear safety regulations and considerably increased the risk 
arising from the fault. The chiefs of the nuclear plant decided 
to disconnect the preventative systems of the No. 5 Unit and 
reconnect it to its normal power supply because the standby 
power supply system, fed from diesel generators, was unreliable. 
However, on the very next day, "someone" countermanded this 
order. A further short circuit occurred, which, according to 
the experts, lasted for more than a minute. A fire broke out 
that burned for over two hours. As a result of all this, until 
12 December 1992, we had to import from Ukraine additional 
electric power costing about 600 million leva.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Tsvetan Totomirov, </F>
commander in chief of the Bulgarian Ground Forces, by Vasil 
Lyutskanov; date not given: "We Were Not Created by Foreign 
Commission, the 'Soviet Connection' Has Never Interfered With 
Us"] 
  [Text] [Lyutskanov] General Totomirov, how would you 
comment on the allegations in connection with the alleged 
elimination of the Ground Forces command [KSV]. Do you know 
anything about the source of the rumors, and how do you rate the 
arguments "for" and "against" such alleged intentions? 
  [Totomirov] Personally, I am convinced that the question is 
being artificially fanned by the press and is based on various 
sources. If we accept such rumors as true, they apply in 
particular to the Ground Forces [SV] personnel. Reflecting on 
this aspect of the question I can only assume that such 
ill-intentioned, conspiratorial rumors, conceived "in the dark," 
serve certain poorly concocted plans that reflect a total lack 
of patriotic feelings. My conviction is based on the recent 
meeting between the KSV and members of the parliamentary 
National Security Commission. 
  At the meeting the commission chairman Mr. Slatinski, 
himself, and the representatives of the Defense Ministry and 
Army General Staff confirmed that eliminating the KSV was not on 
the agenda for the time being. The allegation that the KSV was 
created by "foreign commission," that is, on the initiative of 
the Warsaw Pact, also appears outdated. It was clear that such 
command staffs were established long before us in NATO 
member-states such as Greece, France, the UK, Italy, and other 
countries. The most convincing evidence of the absence of a 
"Soviet connection" in the creation of the KSV within the 
Bulgarian Army is the establishment of an analogous command 
staff in the Romanian Army following the disbanding of the 
Warsaw Pact, rather than during the time it still existed. 
Thus, I do not believe rumors and allegations, but prefer to 
trust authoritative institutions. In other words, no arguments 
"for" and "against" disbanding the KSV exist at all. I would 
rather say that we are confronted with a poorly concocted 
"fiction" based on specific, biased intentions. 
  [Lyutskanov] Are you expecting any dismissals among the 
officers and sergeants in the Ground Forces? 
  [Totomirov] There are constant rumors about imminent 
dismissals. Not only do they have a negative impact on the 
self- confidence and enthusiasm of our officers and sergeants, 
but are a cause of concern for military personnel, for all 
employees and workers in the military institutions. An officer 
who has devoted his entire life to the military does not deserve 
to be confronted with such uncertainty about his future. It is 
very easy to dismiss officers and sergeants; it is much more 
difficult to train military cadres. While the first thing, 
dismissal, is a unilateral act and can be done at a stroke, the 
second is a very difficult and lengthy process. The Ground 
Forces are currently suffering from a lack of the necessary 
officers' corps. Unlike in previous years, however, the lack of 
well-trained officers not only affects the command staffs, but 
also the sub-units. Compared with the past, 20 percent of the 
officers' posts are unoccupied in the KSV today. The reformed 
Bulgarian Army needs well trained and experienced cadres. Hence, 
before dismissing cadres, we should know who will replace them. 
  [Lyutskanov] What kind of resources in terms of money and 
officers are required for the redeployment of the SV in 
accordance with the new military doctrine? 
  [Totomirov] The SV reform is a complicated and lengthy 
process involving the following tasks: redeployment of certain 
units and groups of units, transition to brigade organization 
and adjusting the combat staff to the established quotas, 
rearmament with effective and updated armaments and equipment, 
improvement in the professional training of military cadres and 
personnel, transition to a system of mixed equipment 
[komplektuvane] of the troops, and so forth. These tasks 
require the implementation of a series of measures, but they 
also call for time and money. So if I mention an amount needed 
for the redeployment of the SV, it would hardly be accurate. 
Before redeploying the sub-units, we must build, repair, or 
adapt the barracks and living quarters for army personnel to the 
existing infrastructure. We need to provide parking space and 
storage, and premises and facilities so training can be carried 
out inside and outside the barracks. In 1993 only 17 million 
leva out of the 160 million needed were granted for the planned 
major repairs of storage areas and parking facilities. A total 
of 2,049 officers in Plovdiv, Sliven, Stara Zagora, Blagoevgrad, 
and Shumen have no quarters. Considerably fewer motor vehicles 
than necessary are provided for our units and groups of units 
today, which means that the number of firing exercises and the 
amount of tactical training has to be reduced. We are trying to 
promote certain measures that do not cost much money. As far as 
the officers' corps of the Ground Forces is concerned, it is 
well trained and ready to implement the reform. It is now 
necessary to fulfill the remaining conditions for the reform.

  [Text] Sofia, al Rabia'a [Mar] 24, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY 
-- The delegation of preachers, sermonisers and teachers of 
Islam, the Qur'an, and the Arabic language who are on the way to 
Belgrade to conciliate between the warring factions in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina met yesterday in Sofia with Ahmed Dogan, the 
president of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms which 
represents Muslims in the Republic of Bulgaria. The movement is 
one of the most leading political forces in Bulgaria. 
  During this meeting, the two sides examined relations 
between 
the Great Jamahiriyah and Bulgaria, ways to improve these 
relations and the current situation in the Balkans. 
  During this meeting, Ahmed Dogan payed tribute to the 
inititiave and efforts undertaken by the leader of the 
revolution in order to seek a peaceful and just solution to the 
conflict underway in the region known formerly as Yugoslavia as 
well as the leader's concern for the conditions of Muslims 
throughout the world and the assistance the can offer. 
  The president of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms in 
Bulgaria then commended the tireless efforts of the Great 
Jamahiriyah in order to restore security and stability to the 
region through conciliation and ending the fighting between the 
warring factions in bosnia hercegovina with the initiative which 
it is carrying out. He said the initiative demonstrates the 
Great Jamahiriyah's desire to ensure that peace and security 
prevails throughout the world. The president of the Movement for 
Freedom and Rights reaffirmed the solidarity of the Islamic 
movement in Bulgaria with the Great Jamahiriyah in resisting the 
unjust harsh measures imposed on it by [words indistinct] the 
baseless resolution imposed by the western countries through the 
so-called Security Council. The president applauded the 
enlightened attitude and wise policy adopted by the Great 
Jamahiriyah in dealing with this crisis. 
  The delegation of sermonisers and preachers also met in 
Sofia 
yesterday with Zhan Videnov, the president of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party who expressed his pleasure with the initiative 
of the Great Jamahiriyah to conciliate between the warring 
factions in Bosnia-Herzegovina and bring an end to the fighting 
between them. 
  He said that this was proof of the stance of the Great 
Jamahiriyah aimed at achieving pece and security in the Balkans 
despite the unjust harsh measures imposed on it. 
  Attending these meetings were Dr. 'Ali Turayki, the envoy of 
the General Peoples Committee for Foreign Liaison and 
International Cooperation entrusted with following up the 
initiative proposed by the leader of the revolution to seek a 
peaceful solution to the conflict underway in the former 
Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Article by Yonko Kalpazanov: "Is It a Question of Personal </F>
Choice?"] 
  [Text] We are once again confronted with a case of 
coinciding views between the New Alliance for Democracy [NSD] 
and the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]. Their leaders have 
assumed similar stands in connection with Professor Berov's 
illness and the ensuing results for the government. They claim 
that it is a question of the prime minister's personal decision 
whether he wishes to remain in his post or resign, whether he 
should choose between his health and a political career. 
According to the aforementioned leaders, it is the same whether 
the prime minister should go to Brussels for a week or whether 
he should go for treatment to the government officials' clinic 
at the Military Hospital. 
  The unanimity is not surprising; it only confirms the 
prevailing conviction that the NSD is an offspring of the BSP. 
The only reason for surprise is the lightheartedness with which 
both political organizations are treating issues of crucial 
importance for our country. 
  After one week abroad, Mr. Berov is supposed to resume the 
prime minister's seat and continue chairing the government 
(although with rather doubtful chances of success, as a matter 
of fact) and to bear the responsibility for the country, 
according to Article 108, paragraph 2, of the Constitution. 
After several weeks in the hospital, the prime minister is 
expected to undergo a few months of rehabilitation treatment in 
a special clinic or at home. Throughout all this time, he is 
neither subjectively nor objectively in a position to bear the 
responsibility for the government. This would be the time of 
missing responsibility, which is so convenient for the 
destructive intentions of Balkan and Bulgarian communism and its 
satellites. 
  It is naive to believe and cynical to claim that an 
individual who has suffered a severe heart attack, who has 
undergone surgery including four bypasses, and who is 70 years 
old could once more assume the fully fledged leadership of the 
state, especially considering his "achievements" at a time when 
he was in good health. 
  Good intentions and personal ambitions should give in to the 
laws of human physiology. The commentaries about Prof. Berov's 
illness are frequently lacking in objectivity, under the 
influence of emotions. 
  We are all mortal. It is an understandable human reaction to 
feel sympathy for those who are suffering from ill health. 
Nevertheless, when Bulgaria's vital interests are at stake, 
truth should prevail over courtesy. We should have the courage 
to tell the truth in a spirit of tolerance and to bear it with 
stoicism. 
  For objective medical reasons, Prof. Berov is no longer in a 
position to preside over the Bulgarian Government, especially 
considering the difficult period that our country is going 
through. An incapacitated prime minister with two deputy prime 
ministers, who are notorious offsprings of "mature socialism" in 
command, means to further accelerate the pace of 
recommunization, which is already under way in our country, to 
an unprecedented extent. Prof. Berov's remaining in his post, 
and even a delay of his resignation, would be detrimental to his 
health and a disaster for Bulgaria. 
  The prime minister's resignation, and hence the resignation 
of his cabinet, is not a matter of personal choice but an 
absolute necessity for the preservation of our national 
interests. Let us hope that Prof. Berov, whom, as I am 
convinced, we all wish a prompt recovery, will come to a 
decision that should be worthy of himself and would make things 
easier for Bulgaria.

  [Text] Helsinki, March 24 (AFP) -- Croatian Foreign 
Minister Mate Granic expressed hope Thursday that negotiations 
with separatist Serbs in the disputed Krajina region in southern 
Croatia would lead to an overall ceasefire. 
  "I'm hopeful," Granic said at a brief press conference after 
talks with Finnish leaders. Granic also said Zagreb was ready to 
grant limited autonomy to Krajina Serbs but ruled out full 
"independence" as demanded by local Serbs. 
  The first round of negotiations between Croatian officials 
and Croatian Serb leaders in Zagreb were adjourned early 
Wednesday but the two sides agreed to meet again next week. The 
negotiations at the Russian Embassy were the first of its kind 
to be held in Zagreb under the auspices of the United Nations 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Granic, who arrived here Wednesday 
evening on a 24-hour visit, had talks Thursday with Finnish 
President Martti Ahtisaari, Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, 
parliamentary speaker Riitta Uosukainen and the chairman of the 
parliamentary foreign affairs committee Pertti Paasio. 
  Granic said he had briefed Finnish leaders on the situation 
in his country and Croatian policy on the former Yugoslavia. 
Ahtisaari, who earlier this year was elected Finland's head of 
state, was himself involved last year in Yugoslavia peace talks 
in Geneva as a special representative of UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Helsinki was the last leg of Granic's 
Nordic tour that also included stops in Oslo, Stockholm and 
Copenhagen.

  [Text] As we said in the headlines, the 39th session of the 
people's assembly of the Srpska republic began in Pale today to 
define a platform for the continuation of negotiations in the 
light of the newly created circumstances following the signing 
of the Croat-Muslim agreement and enabling Turkey to send its 
troops to the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. An address on the 
current international situation in the light of the Geneva 
negotiations was delivered by Radovan Karadzic, president of the 
Srpska republic. Here is a report by [name indistinct]: 
  [Correspondent] [passage indistinct] On the ground the 
situation is characterized by Muslim attacks on our positions 
and the stage-managing of bloody incidents in Sarajevo, the most 
tragic of which took place in Markale, and which has already 
been proven to have been perpetrated by the Muslim side. 
However, this incident was one of the heaviest blows on us by 
the international community because the blame was put on us as 
usual, Karadzic said, adding: 
  [Karadzic] "On 6 February this year [passage indistinct]. 
Both sides were to hand in their heavy weapons -- Sarajevo was 
thus to be taken off from the world headlines, as the Muslim 
side in Sarajevo heavily used it for its propaganda against us. 
  "As you know, on 9 February the ultimatum was issued, which 
more or less contained what we had agreed with Mr. Akashi, and 
so we adjusted our actions to be exclusively in accordance with 
the agreement with Mr. Akashi. However, there was no firm will 
to withdraw the weapons or partly to place them under control, 
because our agreement with Akashi did not set that out. 
However, the international community assessed -- maybe Russia 
did it on its own or in cooperation with others -- that a 
dangerous moment came as the Serbs had not withdrawn their 
weapons seven days prior to the expiration of the ultimatum, and 
that NATO would inevitably strike [passage indistinct] and that 
it would be good to make a compromise with the Serbs. A 
compromise was made when Churkin arrived bringing a message from 
President Yeltsin to President Milosevic and to us here saying 
that the Russians were guaranteeing the cease-fire, and we then 
reached a situation whereby we could accept that proposal. 
Thus, in addition to the United States, we ushered Russia and 
Russian diplomacy through a wide-open door to the resolution of 
that problem. You know what happened afterwards. 
  "After the ultimatum -- which is the ultimate form of 
pressure, the worst pressure, the hardest threat -- U.S. 
diplomats came to us. The ultimatum may have been in the 
service of opening a door [word indistinct] success for the U.S. 
diplomacy. And the U.S. diplomacy, as the United States is 
biased first to the benefit of the Muslims and then of the 
Croats, started working with the Muslims and the Croats. Back 
on 9 and 10 February we were informed in Geneva by Mr. Redman, 
the U.S. envoy [passage indistinct] because of our entire 
history in 20th century and then we thought that this was a 
solution. 
  "The difficulties that arose in connection with a European 
Union proposal on the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina into three 
parts started being overcome as a possibility to divide Bosnia 
into two parts emerged. We had earlier heard some presumptions 
in the European circles about Bosnia-Herzegovina being divided 
into two parts in several options: one option was this -- that 
the Croats and Muslims should unite into one state with the 
Serbs remaining in another one. The second option was that the 
Muslims should go with the Serbs and set up a Serb-Muslim state, 
i.e., some kind of a state, or to join Yugoslavia, and the third 
option was that Bosnia should be divided between the Serbs and 
the Croats, because of some tendencies in the Tuzla basin to 
join Yugoslavia, while in Zenica (?and Cazin) there were 
tendencies to join Croatia. That option would not have been 
favorable for the Muslims, neither were we crazy about this 
option, as we deem that the antagonizing of our ethnic 
communities would have continued. There were some other options 
of division into two states. 
  "Considering the new campaign and partial military successes 
by the Muslim side, there was the danger that Croats might lose 
all their territory, which was not in our interest, despite the 
fact that we have been enemies almost throughout the 20th 
century. We believe that we should reach a solution 
satisfactory for all three nations, and only such a solution can 
be lasting and stable. A solution which would possibly harm 
Serbs or Croats would be particularly unfavorable, because the 
basis of the stability in the Balkans is in the relations 
between Serbs and Croats. 
  "Realistically, and from a political point of view, that is 
a 
signature of two sovereign nations and their legitimate 
representatives which regulates the life of those national 
communities in their territories. Therefore, that signature has 
suspended any kind of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- a unitary one, a 
union or any kind of [word indistinct]. Simply, from the legal 
and political point of view, since the signing, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has been in the status [word indistinct]; 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is now material from which everyone makes 
what they believe they should and can make." 
  [Correspondent] Meanwhile, we have strengthened our 
relations with Russian diplomacy. [Bosnian Serb] Foreign 
Minister Aleksa Buha visited Russia. Our delegation stayed in 
Russia for three days. We had a meeting with Churkin, worked on 
the possibilities of opening Tuzla airport and on the resolution 
France insisted on for Sarajevo. The results are obvious, by 
the mere fact that the resolution became acceptable for us, that 
is, less unacceptable than it was. Karadzic had the following 
to say about the current positions: 
  [Karadzic] "As far as the conference is concerned, we have 
been bypassed, not to say expelled, or left behind like orphans. 
They met there and are now creating their own state. But for 
us, this has more good than bad sides: we do not have to accept 
what we did not take part in preparing, we do not have to join 
it in this form. We can open up a completely new process of 
negotiating as the situation created by the signing is 
completely new to us. 
  "Nobody has the right nor can call on us to join, as we are 
not a nation to be attached, we are just as much sovereign as 
the Croats and the Muslims are. They have to recognize the same 
rights to us, the same rights that they have given themselves. 
And [word indistinct] documents that Mr. [name indistinct] 
mentioned as being a base for their (?setting up), that is the 
sovereign right and the state-building right of those two 
nations." 
  [Correspondent] Karadzic then warned that the European Union 
[EU] promised to lift the sanctions to reward the willingness to 
cooperate and concessions given by the Serb side. However, the 
European Union has not fulfilled this. In connection with the 
future of the peace process, i.e. the continuation of peace 
negotiations Karadzic said: 
  [Karadzic] "We are in a situation whereby we shall continue 
negotiations although Resolution 820 is still in force; this 
resolution is exclusively in connection with our rejection of 
the Vance-Owen plan. The acceptance of the EU plan in two 
different forms has not made anyone think about suspending 
Resolution 820. That is a resolution that is strangling the 
Serb people, strangling entire Yugoslavia and [words 
indistinct], all the documents, oil for humanitarian purposes, 
and so on. 
  "We have to decide whether we shall join any kind of 
conference that was prepared without us, whose official 
documents were examined, prepared and adopted by the two sides 
in our complete absence. Then, decide whether we shall join any 
international conference if the international community does not 
make some goodwill gestures and recognize the Serb willingness 
to cooperate. We are not asking them to abolish the sanctions 
and say that Serbia is not guilty, although it is clear to the 
entire world now that Serbia is not to blame. But we want them 
at least to fulfill their basic promises, i.e. comply with 
agreements which forced us to make some political and 
territorial concessions. We are not asking them to make a final 
judgement about the inadequacy of the sanctions, that Serbia is 
not to blame, that it is not responsible and is not involved in 
fighting. We are asking for a practical approach to the Serbs 
in their carrot-and-stick policy. In one hand they are holding 
a [word indistinct], in another one a stick. We are wondering 
what they are offering the Serbs. In both hands they are 
holding a stick. If they had three hands they would be holding 
three sticks." 
  [Correspondent] In this report, we would like to single out 
one more segment from President Karadzic's address. It refers 
to a decision by the United Nations Security Council providing 
for the deployment of Turkish troops in Bosnia: 
  [Karadzic] "The latest decision by a committee granting the 
right to the Secretary General to accept Turkish troops in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is leading us to believe that a big Balkan 
conflict is being prepared. If this conflict becomes necessary 
to the international players, full conditions for a big Balkan 
war will be created by the deployment of the Turkish troops. We 
are calling on the Secretary General never to invite a 
neighboring country, no country -- former occupier -- to deploy 
their troops here neither as observers, technicians, such as 
technicians [passage indistinct]. 
  "Reasons of good taste should guide the German Government to 
keep its hands away from the remainder of Yugoslavia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The greater German state policy and 
diplomacy have left their fingerprints all over the ruins of 
Yugoslavia. The history will show it, Germany is to blame and 
is responsible for the redefining of the outcome of World War 
II. Let it be the concern for Britain and France, for Slovenia 
and Croatia, that again came under the German influence and 
which enabled Germany to win World War II at the negotiating 
table. Our concern is that this should not refer to us. We won 
World War II, we have won this war, and we want Germany to stay 
away from us. 
  "Now to speak about Turkey. If Turkish troops are deployed, 
even if in our neighboring country -- the Muslim-Croat 
federation -- we will then demand that the Yugoslav troops, 
troops of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as a UN member and 
as a neighboring country, be deployed on our side."

  [Text] Belgrade, March 24 (AFP) -- Radovan Karadzic urged 
the Bosnian Serbs' self-styled parliament not to sign on to a 
new Croat-Moslem federation agreement but refused to rule out 
other kinds of ties with the entity. 
  Speaking in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale near 
Sarajevo, the Bosnian Serb leader urged the lawmakers "to reject 
out of hand all participation in the new Croat-Moslem 
federation." 
  But he said he "did not rule out the possibility of 
establishing various types of ties with the newly created state, 
but not federal ties." 
  An agreement to create the federation was signed last Friday 
in Washington by Bosnian Croat and Moslem leaders. It is 
designed to put pressure on the Serbs, who control most of 
Bosnia after nearly two years of war, to end the fighting. 
  Karadzic said the Bosnian Serbs wanted "a sovereign and 
independent state" and would consider at some point in the 
future their relations with the former Yugoslav republics. 
  He said he was willing to recognize the new federation "so 
long as the Serbs obtain access to the sea." This was seen as 
signaling willingness to give up conquered land. 
  The United States and Russia have been trying to get the 
Bosnian Serbs to join up with the new federation as a way of 
maintaining Bosnia as something resembling a unified state. The 
federation is currently designed to cover half of Bosnia's land, 
but the Serbs control around 70 percent of the republic's 
territory.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, March 24 (TANJUG) -- The president of the 
Bosnian Serb Republic (RS), Radovan Karadzic warned on Thursday 
that the decision to deploy Turkish U.N. troops in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina would create conditions for a major Balkan 
war. 
  Karadzic told a RS parliamentary session in Pale, RS 
political centre close to Sarajevo, that if Turkish soldiers are 
sent to the Moslem-Croat state in Bosnia, the Bosnian Serbs 
would demand that in its territory are deployed the troops of 
the neighbouring Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a U.N. 
member, said Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA. 
  The United Nations has so far operated on the principle not 
to deploy troops of neighbouring countries and earlier occupiers 
in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. 
  The region of Bosnia-Herzegovina was for 500 years (until 
the 
beginning of the 20th century) under Turkish occupation, and 
this is still vivid in the memories of the Bosnian population, 
especially the Serbs. 
  However, the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday gave the 
go-ahead to a proposal by the secretary-general that Turkish 
peacekeepers be deployed in Bosnia and passed on the final 
decision to Butrus-Ghali. 
  The latest reports from the U.N. New York headquarters are 
that the Turkish U.N. contigent should be deployed along the 
separation lines between the Bosnian Moslems and Croats, who 
succumbed to strong U.S. pressure last week and signed an accord 
on setting up their federation in Bosnia. 
  Karadzic informed the parliamentary session about the 
outcome 
of the peace talks on Bosnia held so far and the proposal to 
determine a new platform for their continuation. 
  Karadzic suggested to the deputies to adopt a platform which 
would include a demand for establishing peace, just territorial 
delimitation, the rejection of the Serb participation in the 
Moslem-Croat federation and which would insist on the Serbs' 
right to self-determination.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 24 Mar (TANJUG) -- The deputies of the 
People's Assembly of the Srpska republic today adopted a report 
on the course of the Geneva talks and the Serb delegation's 
stances on the negotiations. 
  The conclusions are that the platform on future talks 
remains 
the same and that any possibility of the Srpska republic joining 
the Croat-Muslim federation is ruled out. However, the 
possibility of forming links with the newly created entities 
remains open, but only after the strategic interests of the Serb 
nation are realized. 
  The session of the Srpska republic people's assembly resumed 
work at 1800 with discussion of internal policy. This part of 
the session is held behind closed doors.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 24 Mar (TANJUG) -- This evening the 
assembly of the Srpska republic (RS) adopted a platform on the 
future activities of the RS delegation at the peace talks, in 
which it stressed that the RS could not join the Croat-Muslim 
Federation because no conditions existed for a joint state. 
  The platform stresses that the RS is asking the 
international 
community -- before any peace talks take place -- to meet its 
obligations toward Serbs regarding the suspension, i.e., 
abolition of sanctions. 
  The RS sees the Croat-Muslim Federation agreement and the 
agreement on a confederation with Croatia as the realization of 
the rights of these two nations to freely decide on their 
political and state status. At the same time, the Assembly 
maintains that the creation of a new federation and its entering 
into a confederation with Croatia means a formal and legal 
suspension of the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  By not being included in the talks, the RS has in fact been 
recognized as a state entity. The RS cannot join the 
Croat-Muslim Federation because conditions do not exist for a 
joint state, the platform stresses. 
  Since the new Croat-Muslim state can engage in hostile 
activities against the RS, the RS must -- in the interest of 
lasting peace and stability in the region -- secure just and 
defendable borders that will encompass Serb ethnic areas, the 
platform says, adding that when conditions for the continuation 
of talks are created the RS will maintain a stand that the 
negotiating process be conducted in stages. 
  The first stage is to conclude peace and freeze all military 
activities without prejudging territorial solutions or the 
nature of future interstate ties. 
  This would be followed by demarcation and the final 
establishment of borders between the Croat-Muslim Federation and 
the Srpska republic, and the recognition of the sovereignty and 
independence of the Srpska republic. 
  Talks on mutual relations between these states, together 
with 
the review of possibilities for the establishment of different 
ties between the newly created and former Yugoslav republics, 
would be the last stage. 
  The resolution of the crisis, it was said, should be guided 
by scientifically established facts about the Serbs, Croats, 
Muslims, and their territories, as well as by international 
documents on the creation of Yugoslavia. 
  The platform also proposes an alternative order of stages, 
as 
recognized by the international community -- including the 
United States -- when Yugoslavia was founded in 1919 [sentence 
as received]. 
  In the first stage, apart from the already recognized Croat- 
Muslim Federation, the international community should also 
recognize the Srpska republic and leave territorial questions 
for some later date. 
  The second stage would be to resolve territorial issues 
peacefully, while the third would be to examine possible ties 
between the states.

  [Text] "The roots of Serbhood are in Sarajevo, it is 
Serbian ethnic territory. The Muslims are probably counting on 
the time when they will again mix Serbs and Muslim, thus making 
Sarajevo theirs. But that will not be accepted. 
  "I believe in the possibility of Sarajevo one day becoming a 
unified city, but it will not belong to the Muslims, but to the 
Srpska republic," claims Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the 
Srpska republic assembly, in an interview for SVET. "We will 
never agree to the deployment of German or Turkish troops, 
because they are still in the service of imperialism. The 
Russian soldiers here can be compared to the troops from other 
Islamic countries [as published], against whom we have nothing 
-- except for Turkey. If Turkey succeeds in pushing its 
proposal through the United Nations, we shall ask that 
Yugoslavia send its troops to Bosnia," says Krajisnik.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jovan Zametica, adviser to Bosnian Serb </F>
leader Radovan Karadzic, by Jozsef Szabo; place and date not 
given: "According to Karadzic, Territorial Concessions Cannot Be 
Made"] 
  [Text] The Bosnian Serbs consider joining the 
Bosnian-Croatian confederation to be impossible. Jovan 
Zametica, adviser to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, gave 
an interview to NEPSZABADSAG on the new situation in the 
area. 
  [Szabo] Why did the Serbs "accidentally" leave weapons at 
Sarajevo? 
  [Zametica] The weapons were not hidden, they did not even 
need to be discovered. The UN Blue Helmets had precise 
information on their location from before. The Serbs were not 
hiding these weapons. This is a case of different 
interpretations of the boundaries of the demilitarized zone 
around Sarajevo. 
  [Szabo] Where were these weapons? 
  [Zametica] According to the Serbian side, they were a few 
hundred meters outside the 20-kilometer limit of the 
demilitarized zone defined by the United Nations. The 
misunderstanding came from the fact that the Blue Helmets and 
the Serbs determined Sarajevo's center differently and marked 
the 20 kilometers from this point. 
  [Szabo] What will happen to the weapons? 
  [Zametica] We agreed with a general of the Blue Helmets that 
we would jointly define Sarajevo's center on the map and we will 
then measure the 20 kilometers from there. If Serbian heavy 
artillery happens to be in this area then we will withdraw it or 
place it under UN supervision. 
  [Szabo] What are your views on the Croatian-Bosnian 
agreement? 
  [Zametica] We have many reasons for caution when it comes to 
any kind of alliances between the Croatians and the Bosnians. 
It is their business if they want to live together, we have no 
say in this. Our only requirement is that their confederation 
must not cause any territorial or military damage to the Serbs. 
  [Szabo] Is it possible for the Serbs to also join this 
confederation? 
  [Zametica] The chance is minimal. 
  [Szabo] In this case, according to Moscow, you will have to 
make further territorial concessions. 
  [Zametica] At the peace talks, the Serbs have always made 
certain concessions. However, there is a limit after which we 
will not make any more concessions. 
  [Szabo] Where is this limit? 
  [Zametica] It is not easy to give exact percentages of the 
Serbian areas, although Karadzic recently said that he wants to 
keep 56 to 58 percent of Bosnia's territory. Our goal is to 
live in compact areas. 
  [Szabo] Nevertheless, you have recently been forced to make 
concessions. 
  [Zametica] Territorial concessions are out of the question. 
We have only removed our artillery from around Sarajevo. We did 
not make any concessions at Tuzla, either; we agreed to opening 
the airport under certain conditions, but this has not yet 
happened. The UN plane was able to land on 22 March with our 
agreement. Talks are still underway on opening the airport. We 
will not let ourselves be excluded from the supervision. We did 
not make any territorial concessions at Maglaj, either, we only 
agreed to the delivery of aid to the city. To the outsider it 
may seem that we are making territorial concessions, but what we 
are trying to do is to facilitate an overall Bosnian peace 
agreement through compromises.

<F P=106> [Sead Cusovic report from the Information Service of the 1st </F>
Army Corps] 
  [Text] The day today fully resembles all the previous 
days, because the aggressor has continued violating the 
cease-fire as he has done since the conclusion of the agreement. 
So, at about 1700, one of our fellow citizens was wounded in 
Brijesce. She was attacked with a sower of death [M-84 machine 
gun] from the direction of Bacici. 
  Chetnik provocations with infantry weapons were also 
registered in the regions of Glavica, Brekin Potok, and Hotonj. 
Cumulative mortars were used near Vrbanja Most. Stup was 
attacked with portable mortars from the enemy positions. 
  The so-called cease-fire should therefore not instill too 
much certainty to the residents of Sarajevo. They are advised to 
continue exercising caution.

  [Text] [Announcer] The separation lines between the Croat 
Defense Council [HVO] and Muslim formations are quiet. Since 
this morning, however, Serb artillery has been attacking the 
Muslim-controlled part of Novi Travnik. Zdenko Vranjes reports 
in more detail. 
  [Vranjes] This morning Serb artillery attacked the 
Muslim-controlled part of Novi Travnik. Fierce artillery 
clashes between the Serb and the Muslim forces are still raging. 
According to this town's people, the separation lines between 
the HVO and the Muslim army are absolutely quiet. 
  Mostar is also quiet. Last night there were some isolated 
provocations from infantry weapons in the town center. In 
Uskoplje [Gornji Vakuf] Muslim and Croat representatives are 
today discussing the further exchange of POW's in keeping with 
the all-for-all principle. The exchange of POW's from central 
Bosnia remains to be carried out. 
  Until the next elections the Croatian Democratic Union 
[Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica] of Bosnia-Herzegovina is the 
only legal representative of Croat interests in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croat National Council from Sarajevo or 
any other minority group of Croat deputies has no right to act 
on behalf of all Croat deputies and the entire Croat people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Bosnia-Herzegovina HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Community] said in its statement today.

  [Excerpt] The shelling of the central section of the Brcko 
defense, which has been pounded with tanks and 120-mm mortars 
since 0630, has in the meantime been stepped up with fire from 
122-mm howitzers, mortars of [word indistinct] and 82-mm, [word 
indistinct] and recoilless guns. Chetnik antiaircraft guns, 
brownings, portable mortars, and snipers are attacking almost 
all parts of our defense. There have been no infantry attacks 
yet, which clearly indicates what the real aim of the Serbian 
aggressor is, namely to destroy as much as it can and to kill as 
many people as possible on the free territory. [passage omitted]

these areas. 
  The situation in the district is increasingly more

more difficult, and the spring sowing is also in question [words

  [Text] Viktor Boban reports from the Press Center of the 
Bosna Operations Group that the fierce shelling by the aggressor 
killed one and wounded two civilians. 
  [Boban] The enemy is still trying to breach the defense 
lines on the Rujnica front. All their attempts hitherto have 
been thwarted. In some sectors the defenders launched attacks 
themselves. In the fighting, which is still in progress, the 
Serbian aggressor has suffered significant losses in manpower, 
more than 15 were killed and many more put out of action. 
  Considering the ferocity of the chetnik attacks, new 
attempts 
to breach the defense lines should be expected. The soldiers 
and officers of the Bosna Operations Group are ready to protect 
their positions.

  [Text] After fierce chetnik attacks and after yet another 
attempt by the aggressor forces to make further advances, a 
general danger alarm was sounded in Zavidovici. The chetnik 
advance was nevertheless halted by a successful counteroffensive 
by our fighters. 
  The usual chetnik provocations also continued on the free 
territory of Zvornik. However, demonstrating their courage, our 
defenders have again been very successful. Today, the enemy 
also pounded the city center of Olovo and the positions of our 
defenders. Like all other attempts by the aggressor to breach 
the lines of our defense, this one was also unsuccessful. 
  This morning, the chetniks opened sniper fire on Kasindol 
street from the Bosut Barracks. The aggressor attacked Dobrinja 
with infantry weapons from Nedjarici. Stup was attacked with 
bombs fired from portable mortars. This was reported by the 
Information Service of the 1st Army Corps. 
  The ferocity of the chetnik attacks in the zone of 
operations 
of the 3d Army Corps was offset by the defenders-members of the 
Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, inflicting great 
losses on them in manpower and equipment. They are also 
liberating parts of occupied territories. Since it cannot do 
anything else, the aggressor is shelling villages, towns, and 
the civilian population. There have been no violations of the 
cease-fire agreement reached by the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] in this region. The 
truce is generally holding at other lines of separation. 
  In line with the agreement reached the day before yesterday 
by the negotiating teams of the Army of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the aggressor side, and the representatives 
of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], three prisoners held by the 
aggressor soldiers in Silos prison in (?Tarcin) were exchanged 
for three civilians from Kula prison. 
  The process of exchanging prisoners is the first and the 
most 
controversial point in the Silajdzic-Krajisnik negotiations. 
The realization of other points from this agreement did not 
take place because of the lack of cooperation by the aggressor 
side. So, the issue of Silos and the 189 missing Bosniaks, who, 
according to their families, were taken by the terrorist chetnik 
forces to an unknown destination, remains unresolved.

  [Text] Zagreb, March 24 (AFP) -- Ten Danish drivers were 
lined up against a wall and "feared that they would be shot" 
after their relief trucks were stolen by Bosnian Serb soldiers 
near the northern Bosnian town of Maglaj, a UN spokesman said 
here Thursday. Later they were forced to walk for about a 
kilometre through no-man's-land between Bosnian Serb and Croat 
forces, before being taken to a UN Protection Force post by 
Croats. After the theft of their vehicles, the drivers were 
loaded into a lorry and taken towards the nearby front line, UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] spokesman Peter Kessler 
said. "They were then lined up in front of a house. At this 
point it became very, very terrifying for them," he said. "They 
were told to empty their pockets, to give their belongings to 
the Bosnian Serbs. When they saw their personal property being 
thrown on the ground they then feared that they would be shot." 
After being searched the UNHCR drivers were told to walk on 
their own to a minefield, holding white flags over their heads 
and to look out for snipers as it was no-man's-land. It was only 
after walking about a kilometre they located a post manned by 
Bosnian Croat HVO [Croatian Defense Council] forces at Zepce, 
about 30 kilometres (20 miles) south of where they were 
abducted. The Croats drove the team to a UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] base. "The entire situation was terrifying for the 
convoy team," Kessler said. 
  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic earlier Thursday told 
Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary-general's special envoy in 
former Yugoslavia, that the local Serb commander had acted 
without authorisation. He would be punished, Karadzic said, 
according to Kessler. The Serb leader also promised his forces 
would return the nine stolen UN aid-convoy trucks which have 
since been located. 
  Convoys would again start moving from the Croatian capital 
Zagreb to the Maglaj region once the United Nations obtained 
security guarantees, said UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski, adding 
that convoys were nevertheless still leaving from Zenica, in 
central Bosnia.

  [Text] Ljubljana, March 24 (TANJUG) -- Slovenian Prime 
Minister Janez Drnovsek has asked parliament to replace Defence 
Minister Janez Jansa. In a statement for the public released on 
Thursday, Drnovsek accused the defence minister of overstepping 
his authority and violating the republican constitution and 
elementary human rights. 
  Political circles in Ljubljana have indicated that Minister 
Jansa might resort to repressive protection of his office, in 
which, as assessed, he would have the support of part of the 
military leadership. The Slovenian police raised the degree of 
alert of its force on Thursday evening. 
  Jansa is the idol of the Slovenian extreme nationalist right 
and, as his followers often point out, most deserving for 
Slovenia's independence which followed a clash with the former 
Yugoslav People's Army. 
  Several parties, associations, groups of citizens and 
individuals have demanded the defence minister's resignation 
over the past few days.

  [Text] In a letter he sent today, Prime Minister Janez 
Drnovsek informed the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia that 
he had sent the State Chamber his proposal on the replacement of 
Defense Minister Janez Jansa. Namely, the government commission 
investigating into the Smolnikar case has established that 
members of the Defense Ministry have overstepped their powers. 
Therefore, the defense minister must take responsibility for 
that activity. According to Drnovsek, permitting such activity 
would mean deviating from the rule of law. The prime minister 
suggests that the Social Democratic Party should continue 
participating in the government coalition.

  [Text] Janez Jansa, president of the Social Democratic 
Party of Slovenia, said in an open letter to Prime Minister 
Drnovsek that he has received his letter concerning his 
replacement as defense minister. 
  Janez Jansa rebukes Prime Minister Drnovsek as the 
government 
commission that was investigating the Smolnikar case did not 
study all the necessary material. He also asks Janez Drnovsek 
how the government has acted in other cases in which there has 
been an overstepping of authority. 
  According to him, the prime minister proposed the 
replacement 
before the meeting of the parliamentary inquiry commission and 
in the midst of a media lynching. Jansa believes that Drnovsek, 
in this way, prevented the investigation into the background of 
unlawful activities in which individuals and groups have engaged 
for months. 
  The Presidency of the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia 
will discuss this issue tomorrow.

  [Text] The Executive Council of the Slovene Christian 
Democrats, in a statement for the public, condemned any sort of 
use of violence in the fulfillment of political and ideological 
goals. 
  The Slovene Christian Democrats, therefore, call upon all 
those who have violated fundamental moral and ethical principles 
to leave the Slovene political scene. 
  As the second most powerful parliamentary party, the 
Christian Democrats wish to contribute toward appeasement, 
stability, and progress, because divisions cannot be the guiding 
star of the young Slovene state, which was also confirmed by the 
incident in Depala Vas and recent statements by President Milan 
Kucan in Nova Gorica. 
  In cases of abuse of power, the Christian Democrats also 
expect the resignation of incumbent ministers. 
  If it transpires that the president of the republic has also 
been involved in the recent events, the Christian Democrats will 
demand his resignation, too.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Milan Kucan by Robert Hochner in </F>
the ORF studio in Vienna -- recorded; Kucan speaks in Slovene 
with superimposed German translation] 
  [Text] [Hochner] Good evening, Mr. President. 
  [Kucan] Good evening. 
  [Hochner] Mr. President, only 40 km south of your country a 
war is still going on, even though now there appear to be signs 
of a peaceful solution for Bosnia. How optimistic are you that 
what now looks like the beginning of a peace settlement will 
bring real peace to Bosnia? 
  [Kucan] We have to be optimists. What is currently going on 
is still a consequence of the exhaustion caused by this 
senseless war and of the world's bad conscience as a result of 
its inadequate commitment. This should have happened long ago. 
The fact remains that the solution to this crisis now involves 
Brussels, Washington, and Zagreb, on the one hand, and Moscow 
and Belgrade, on the other. These are now, finally, the proper 
partners, who may be able to influence the course of the war, 
and who may achieve the pacification of the area and turn war 
into peace. However, this is far from being the solution to the 
crisis in the Balkans. 
  [Hochner] You have come to Austria to ask for Austrian 
support for Slovenia's ambition to join the European Union [EU]. 
From where does Slovenia's desire arise? Is it participation 
in Europe's economic market or do security issues constitute a 
decisive factor? 
  [Kucan] Slovenia's desire to be included in the process of 
European integration is understandable and is related to the 
desire of all former East bloc countries. It pertains not only 
to economic issues but also to political issues and matters of 
security policy, particularly as a result of the fact that you 
mentioned at the beginning, namely that the war is still raging 
only 40 km away from Slovenia. Still, we are interested in 
getting closer to the EU primarily to achieve democratization of 
relations within Slovenia, and to achieve the consolidation of 
democratic institutions, also as far as relations between the 
civilian state and the defense and military complex are 
concerned. 
  [Hochner] The biggest political problem between Slovenia and 
Austria, or rather the biggest problem in terms of economic 
policy, is Slovenia's huge trade balance deficit with Austria. 
In case Austria joins the EU do you expect that this would also 
improve Slovenia's access to the Austrian market, and do you not 
fear that, as a EU member, Austria would insulate itself more 
strongly against Slovenia? 
  [Kucan] The trade balance deficit is indeed a major problem. 
The two sides, especially the two governments, are determined to 
solve this problem because it has reached a political dimension. 
In December, Prime Minister Drnovsek paid a visit to Vienna and 
the issue was discussed at great length. Nevertheless, there 
are differing approaches to solving the problem, there are 
several possibilities. Should Austria become a EU member on 1 
January 1995, the solution would be of a certain kind, and if it 
does not, then it might also make sense to discuss a free trade 
agreement. 
  [Hochner] Looking at the difficulties within the EU in 
connection with the enlargement by Austria and the three other 
membership candidates, when do you expect the EU to be ready to 
enlarge the community by countries in eastern and southeastern 
Europe, notably Slovenia? 
  [Kucan] It is a question of interest and of clearer views on 
what the future of Europe should look like. The more the EU 
enlarges, the more intense internal relations will become. Any 
enlargement also means a higher level of integration, which in 
turn means that antagonistic positions on principles will 
deteriorate, namely the principle of consensus as the basic 
principle within the EU, and on the other hand, the principle of 
efficiency. After all, if a union is not efficient its very 
existence does not make sense. Still, in a democratic community 
such antagonisms are not irreconcilable, but it is difficult to 
solve such problems. I think that at the moment these 
quandaries are occurring with Austria [words indistinct] 
London-Vienna -- which only proves that enlargement and 
integration will be very difficult. 
  [Hochner] Thank you very much for the interview, Mr. 
President.

  [Text] The Hague, March 23 (AFP) -- Yugoslavia filed a 
complaint against NATO with the International Court of Justice 
[ICJ], accusing its member states of violating the UN charter by 
threatening to use force in Bosnia, a source at the court said 
Wednesday [23 March]. 
  The rump Yugoslavia -- Serbia and Montenegro -- said NATO 
had 
used the threat of force without the required authorization of 
the UN Security Council. 
  Yugoslavia's suit cited the decision taken by the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization at a Feburary 9 meeting in Brussels 
that warned Bosnian Serbs to withdraw heavy guns from Sarajevo 
or face NATO air strikes.

  [Excerpts] Belgrade, 24 Mar (TANJUG) -- At today's Federal 
Government session, chaired by Prime Minister Radoje Kontic, the 
government reviewed a report on current issues concerning the 
position of members of the nations of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia [FRY] in other countries, as well as the position of 
members of the Serb and Montenegrin nations living in the 
territory of the former Socialist Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, which are now outside the territory of Yugoslavia. 
  The Ministry of Information has announced that on the basis 
of this report and the ensuing discussion, the Federal 
Government will adopt special conclusions at one of its future 
sessions. [passage omitted] 
  In a report dealing with requests by certain international 
bodies and organizations to send permanent missions or 
representatives to Kosovo-Metohija, the government noted a clear 
tendency to put forward such requests to replace the suspended 
CSCE mission. 
  The government concluded that for reasons of principle the 
FRY cannot accept requests for a CERD [as received] mission and 
UNESCO representatives to be sent to Yugoslavia and to have a 
seat in Kosovo-Metohija because Yugoslavia as a state is not 
allowed to participate in the work of these bodies and 
organizations as an equal participant. 
  As proof of good will, the Federal Government concluded that 
Yugoslavia still expresses full readiness for dialogue and more 
intensive cooperation on an equal basis with those bodies and 
organizations -- of which Yugoslavia is a signatory, initiator 
and founder -- which is in mutual interest and in the interest 
of peace, security and cooperation in Europe and the world.

  [Text] Pirot, 24 Mar (TANJUG) -- The goal is the 
destruction of all things Slav and of orthodoxy, and that is a 
big war against Russia. You are our first line of defense, 
Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, vice president of the Russian Liberal 
Democratic Party, said at the Pirot municipality headquarters 
this evening. Vengerovskiy is heading a group of Duma deputies 
visiting Yugoslavia. 
  Vengerovskiy said that the Duma deputies arrived in 
Yugoslavia with the intention of learning about the situation in 
this country so that the Russian parliament could help with the 
abolition of sanctions against Yugoslavia. 
  The Russian Duma deputies, who are in Yugoslavia at the 
invitation of the Serbian National Renewal [Srpska Narodna 
Obnova], will visit several places in Serbia and Montenegro.

  [Text] Belgrade, 23 Mar (TANJUG) -- Jovan Zebic, vice 
president of the Federal Government, had talks in the Palace of 
Federation today with Gennadiy Shikin, ambassador of the Russian 
Federation in Belgrade. 
  As the Ministry for Information reports, they talked about 
providing humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia and preparations for 
resuming economic cooperation between the two countries 
following the lifting of sanctions. 
  Vice President Zebic thanked Ambassador Shikin for Russia's 
humanitarian efforts and its initiatives for reaching a lasting 
agreement on a peaceful solution to the crisis in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina that would be acceptable 
to all three warring sides. 
  Ambassador Shikin stated that, unfortunately, Russia's 
efforts in providing humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia have so far 
failed to yield any major result due to the unconstructive and 
unreasonable conduct of some countries in the UN Security 
Council's sanctions committee. Ambassador Shikin noted, 
however, that Russia will continue its efforts to endorse 
humanitarian aid for Yugoslavia, the Ministry for Information 
says in its statement.

<F P=106> [Article by P. Vucinic: "Volunteers by Force"] </F>
  [Text] The story was first raised in the Serbian 
parliament. Milisav Petkovic, a Democratic Party deputy, said 
that a man who "has been a Serbian citizen for 10 years and was 
registered with his military authority in Serbia was taken to a 
school in Derventa where he was forced to sign a statement that 
he was willing to go to the front." 
  "This story about volunteers" originates from Mali Zvornik 
and there is more than one person involved in it. According to 
witnesses, mostly wives of such "volunteers" who were taken away 
in the middle of the night, there are at least nine of them. It 
can be assumed that they are no longer alive. The secret of 
their correct number is hidden in a bus that took them away and 
it must also be known by "the official authorities." Judging by 
what we heard in Mali Zvornik, it seems that the bus was seen 
during the "guilty" night of 10-11 March 1994 only by occupants 
of a building on Ribarska Street in Mali Zvornik. The policeman 
on duty at the police station "did not know what the whole thing 
was about," and recommended that we talk to the police chief who 
was not there "at the moment." 
<H5>  They Came </H5>
  "Two policemen with Serbian police badges came at one in the 
morning and knocked at the door. They wanted to speak to my 
husband and when he got up they told him to follow them to the 
Mali Zvornik police station so that 'they can put down some 
information.' I went to the terrace and saw that he was taken 
to a bus parked in front of the building," Ljiljana Andric, the 
wife of 37-year-old Radovan Andric, told us. 
  Ljiljana and Radovan Andric have lived in Mali Zvornik, in 
the Srpska republic, since December 1991. Radovan Andric was 
employed by the aluminum oxide factory of Zvornik, now 
controlled by the military and civilian authorities of the 
Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since they got an 
apartment in Mali Zvornik, Ljiljana and Radomir gave up their 
residence in Zvornik and were registered in Mali Zvornik. 
Ljiljana Andric told us that Radomir brought his military 
documentation to Mali Zvornik in the Srpska republic. 
  She also told us that her husband remained employed on the 
other river bank, in another state. She said that he was very 
assiduous in doing his work and came home only once a week 
according to a new regulation. That he was a Serbian citizen 
made it impossible for the authorities of the Srpska republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to mobilize him -- until the night of 10-11 
March, 1994. 
  "Nine of them from Ribarska Street 42 were caught like 
rabbits," Ljiljana Andric told us. While she was watching the 
scene from the balcony, she heard the bell ring for a second 
time. One of the policemen came back and offered her his 
company since she was "so lonely." 
  Stevka has a similar story. Her husband Milan Lukic was 
taken away in the same way. "He did not protest when policemen 
asked for his papers. They said that everything would be over 
soon as they had done nothing wrong," Stevka says. 
  Luka Vidovic was taken away early in the morning. His wife 
remained alone with their two children -- an 11-year-old 
daughter and a nine-year-old son, who was suffering from 
leukodistrophy. Borka told the children "Daddy has gone to pick 
up his salary," but they heard at school that their father had 
been arrested as a deserter. Borka lives on the ninth floor of 
a building in which the elevator is broken and she carries the 
sick children on her back even though she is afraid that her 
spine might break some day. She told us that the physicians and 
engineers who live below her were not bothered, although some of 
them had moved from Bosnia to Serbia after the building on 
Ribarska Street was completed. 
<H5>  Across the Drina River </H5>
  "I realized that I cannot complain to anybody," Borka told 
us. "We went to the police, but we were told that they did not 
know anything about it." Slavica Mladenovic was given a 
certificate by the military headquarters in Mali Zvornik stating 
that her husband was registered in that commune, but she was 
allegedly told that that was a document of no significance in 
Zvornik. She was told by the Mali Zvornik police that they "had 
nothing to do with the case." A policeman was seen at Zvornik 
military headquarters who participated in this action. He "did 
not know anything," either. 
  Authorities from both sides of the Drina River pretended 
that 
they had not been informed about the case until the nine men 
reached a telephone and called Derventa, a village between 
Milici and Vlasenica, telling their friends that they had been 
arrested and charged with desertion, adding that they would 
probably be sent to the front line near Srebrenica. Two of them 
who did not want to wear uniforms were beaten up. One of them 
was later released as unfit for duty. Luka Vidovic, who was 
exempt from military service in his military district because of 
his two sick children, was retained. 
  In the meantime, the women visited their husbands who were 
accommodated in an abandoned school; they are waiting now. The 
news they receive is contradictory. According to some 
information, their husbands will come back, but, according to 
other information, they will be retained since the Republic of 
Serbia and the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina have signed 
an agreement on the mobilization of former Bosnia-Herzegovina 
citizens. Borka Vidovic does not know whether or not such an 
agreement has really been reached, but she has the feeling that 
"the whole case must be based on this." 
  Official sources have unofficially confirmed that the story 
about forceful mobilization in Mali Zvornik (Srpska republic) 
for the army of a neighboring state is correct.

  [Excerpt] Podgorica, 23 Mar (TANJUG)--We hope that the 
Yugoslav crisis is reaching its final stage, the stage of an 
antiwar and political outcome, Montenegrin Foreign Affairs 
Minister Miodrag Lekic told POBJEDA today. 
  He added that it would be logical to expect--following the 
agreement on the federal and confederal links between the 
Muslims and Croats that enables the Croats in Bosnia to have 
state and institutional links with their mother 
country--something similar to be offered to the Serbs also so 
that they can link up with their natural homeland, Serbia. By 
taking such an approach, the international community, while in a 
way restoring Yugoslavia--that is, linking parts of that 
formerly complex country--wants to prevent the creation of an 
Islamic fundamentalist Bosnia and to secure natural links 
between identical peoples. 
  Asked whether Montenegro's Ministry for Foreign Affairs will 
be disbanded, Lekic categorically said that the ministry was 
working as usual and that the termination of its work and 
existence was totally out of the question. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Prime Minister Bukoshi Urging for </F>
International Protection of Kosova"] 
  [Text] Speaking at a press conference Monday at the UN 
Headquarters in New York, Kosova Prime Minister Dr. Bujar 
Bukoshi urged the international community to commit itself for 
the solution to the Kosova issue. Speaking before journalists 
at the United Nations, Dr. Bukoshi said: "We call upon the 
United Nations, the United States, the European Union, and 
Russia to comprehensively include Kosova in the peace process, 
because without the solution of Kosova issue there will be no 
peace in Balkans." 
  Prime Minister Bukoshi, who is conducting a three-day visit 
to the United States, the United Nations, and Washington 
respectfully [as published] once again called high and 
decision-making officials not to ignore the explosive situation 
in Kosova and take preventive steps before it gets too late. He 
also said that: "During this month, army movements have 
intensified, and the number of Serbian soldiers to Kosova has 
increased. The situation has deteriorated especially since the 
Serbian paramilitary kill Albanian civilians in cold blood," 
said Dr. Bukoshi, and illustrated it with the latest killings in 
Hani i Ezit and Fusche Kosova. 
  Dr. Bukoshi warned that the peaceful policy of the Kosova 
Government could lose credibility among the Albanian population, 
and said that "this peaceful stand could be used by Belgrade's 
authorities to intensify their repression. Whereas, peaceful 
movement of Albanians could be the reason for neglecting the 
Kosova situation by the international community." 
  "These alarming trends threaten to stop all the progress 
toward peace in Kosova," said Bukoshi, and added that while 
Serbs in Knin and Bosnia are on the verge of achieving their 
territorial aspirations through violence and aggression, 
Albanians in Kosova and Macedonia are facing mounting misery 
only because of their peaceful determination. 
  "Our main purpose is to prevent war in Kosova, and as far as 
our political project is concerned, we had declared our will 
through the referendum. Kosova fulfills all the conditions to 
be an independent state, similar to other republics of former 
Yugoslavia. Kosova is a rich region and has a sufficient human 
potential. We are not asking to unite with Albania and this is 
the biggest compromise we are offering. We are not asking for 
the change of borders through the use of force," answered Dr. 
Bukoshi to the question whether they considered the unification 
with Albania. 
  Asked whether he was requestion a deployment of 
peace-keeping 
troops to Kosova, similar to those in Macedonia, Prime Minister 
Bukoshi said: "The best example of preventive measures by the 
international community is The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia [FYROM]. A civilian-military government under the 
auspices of the United Nations for a certain interim period 
until normalization of life would be the best possible solution. 
Within this framework, demilitarization of Kosova should take 
place, and removal of all paramilitary forces, establishment of 
democratic institutions, such as parliament, government and 
public life."

  [Text] At about 1500 today, Serbian police intervened in 
the Kosova Information Center [QIK] offices in Prishtina. The 
offices are situated in the Qafa complex of business buildings 
in Prishtina. Today, they were held under the continuous 
supervision of the Serbian police. 
  Serbian civilians, who first entered the QIK offices, played 
the role of uninformed citizens. Then, at about 1500, two 
plainclothes policemen entered the offices and took personal 
notes from three QIK reporters. 
  At 1510, four policemen entered the offices. Two of the 
policemen were holding automatic weapons. They ordered the 
reporters to stop work. Meanwhile, the Serbian policemen 
confiscated personal notes from seven QIK reporters. 
  The QIK reports that the Serbian police showed interest in 
the work performed at the office and left, taking the notes with 
them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andras Agoston, chairman of the Democratic </F>
Union of Vojvodina Hungarians, by Imre Sebestyen; place and date 
not given: "The VMDK Does Not Deal With the Issue of Border 
Modification"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Sebestyen] What is your 
opinion of the division within the leadership of the Democratic 
Union of Vojvodina Hungarians [VMDK] and the confrontation? 
  [Agoston] There have been different views within the VMDK 
from the very beginning. VMDK Deputy Chairman Sandor Hodi's 
political position has been the same from the very beginning: 
He starts from the premise that a new settlement will take 
place in this part of Europe and that a border modification is a 
realistic possibility within this new settlement. Thus, for 
him, the implementation of the autonomy concept is the minimum 
that the Serbian leadership should give us because the organized 
political opposition of the Vojvodina Hungarians and the 
international support the Hungarians receive in this forces the 
Serbs to do that. Dialogue and the daily political cooperation 
of coexisting people are not a necessary part of that concept. 
It does not count on the principle of partnership based on 
political subjectivity; instead, it counts on the fact that, as 
a result of favorable international circumstances, the Serbs 
will get into a subordinate position. Naturally, that political 
philosophy only covers the block Hungarians. Given the fact 
that it circumvents the issue of coexistence of people living in 
this area -- first of all the coexistence of Serbs and 
Hungarians -- the concept is abstract and unrealistic. As 
opposed to that -- and in my opinion this political philosophy 
still has greater support within the VMDK -- another line 
emerges as more realistic. The essence of it is that in the 
current situation, the issue of border modification should not 
be included in the political activity of the VMDK. We do not 
want to live in subjugation, but we know that we have to live in 
peace with the others in this region, first of all with the 
Serbs. The Hungarians here must be guaranteed a constitutional 
and legal framework in which they can preserve their identity, 
survive, and remain here without a border modification. This 
legal framework is the autonomy concept of the VMDK. The 
legality and democratic support make it possible for the VMDK to 
act as a political partner in settling the common affairs of the 
Hungarians living in the Carpathina basin. Our common goal is 
to make sure that Hungary becomes a member of the European Union 
as soon as possible and that the Hungarians living beyond 
Hungary's borders can implement their autonomy efforts. The 
results achieved so far prove that there is no politically 
relevant alternative to that idea. On the other side, of 
course, there is the danger that the so-called reformer 
politicians who are also increasingly forced into the background 
within the VMDK might gain ground. The essence of their efforts 
is that they are ready to give up not only the independence and 
political legality of the VMDK but also Hungarian autonomy in 
exchange for Serbian concessions adequate to their individual or 
group interests. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov has sent a letter 
to European Union [EU] President Jacques Delors warning that 
during recent weeks Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] has been left to face the Greek economic 
embargo and the hermetically closed borders with Greece alone. 
Gligorov stresses that this could result in a dramatic economic 
destabilization of Macedonia, and consequently of the overall 
situation in the region. The Macedonian president goes on to 
say that the EU must find a solution to this problem, and notes 
the EU's slowness, lack of determination and unequal treatment 
of the two sides. At the end of his letter to Jacques Delors, 
Gligorov stresses that if the problem with Athens is not solved, 
Macedonia will have to initiate a discussion of the Greek 
embargo in the Security Council.

<F P=106> [Report by Zaneta Skerlev: "$4 Million for Macedonia"] </F>
  [Text] Mr. George Soros, an eminent international 
businessman and founder of the Open Society Foundation, after 
talking to President of the Republic Kiro Gligorov and to 
representatives of the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian 
Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Movement for Macedonian 
National Unity] and PDP [Party of Democratic Prosperity] 
political parties, held a news conference yesterday in which he 
informed he was giving $4 million to Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] in support of its 
efforts to cope with the embargo imposed by Greece. 
  He then emphasized that $2.5 million would be given as 
credit 
without interest for the provision of 20,000 metric tons of corn 
for cattle, and the remaining $1.5 million were a gift for the 
transport costs of the corn to Skopje. Mr. Soros announced that 
in the first 15 days of April this year he would finance the air 
bridge, that is he would cover half of the expenditures for air 
transport of early vegetables from Macedonia to Europe, since 
the air costs were twice as high as the land ones, too high to 
accept. 
  The goal of this gesture of Soros was, as he himself pointed 
out, to help the Macedonian Government in the difficulties it is 
having since the Greek blockade, but first of all -- to turn the 
attention of the European and the world public, which must not 
let the country collapse or fall into the hands of extremists, 
neglecting the lessons of Bosnia and thus creating here a new 
hotbed of crisis with unpredictable consequences. 
  Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov, who attended the 
beginning of the news conference with Soros, emphasized that Mr. 
Soros was ready to help Macedonia throughout the difficult 
times. "Even now," Gligorov said, "he immediately responded to 
my invitation and we had very fruitful discussions about the 
embargo and about what could be done to help Macedonia." 
  "I came to Macedonia because I am very much concerned about 
the fate of this country," Mr. Soros said, "because I think that 
whatever will happen with Macedonia is of great interest for 
Europe and the world." 
  "In this case," he said, "it is very easy to make a 
distinction -- who is the aggressor and who is the victim. If 
this government breaks down because of an economic collapse, and 
if the extremists come, who, we know, are present on both sides, 
there will be a conflict in which many neighboring countries 
will undoubtedly be involved." 
  Mr. Soros also said that everything he pledges for in 
Macedonia in this situation is in danger. Therefore, he conveys 
an appeal to the European countries, to the United States, and 
to the other international factors to undertake concrete actions 
for assisting our country. 
  Answering journalists' questions, Soros said that the 
meetings he held yesterday with representatives of VMRO-DPMNE 
were carried out in a more moderate way than he had expected, 
taking into account the previous criticisms he had been exposed 
to by this party. Soros also said that he had not had any 
contacts with the Greek Government in relation to the loan to 
Macedonia, but he pointed out that he would give an interview to 
Greek Television, in which he would expose his stances. 
Concerning the question that NOVA MAKEDONIJA informed that he 
had conveyed a letter to Clinton in which he stated that the 
survival of Macedonia depended on how much rights the Government 
would give to the minorities, he said that his opinion was that 
the Macedonian Government was sincerely committed and dedicated 
to solving the rights of the minorities, but more should be done 
in that respect. 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  "Inexperienced Diplomacy" </H5>
  I hope President Gligorov will not be angry at me, but I 
have 
to say that he and his government were not successful enough in 
persuading the world about the dangers Macedonia is faced with, 
as well as about the dangers that will come if the situation is 
not changed. Of course, Macedonia does not have great 
experience in diplomacy and in foreign relations. However, I 
say there is a lack of information about the situation in 
Macedonia and the attention of the world's mass media has not 
been sufficiently turned to this side.

commanding officer of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] for 
former Yugoslavia General De Lapresle. They agreed UN peace 
keeping units in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] have completely justified their preventive 
mission and peace preserving role in Macedonia. They also 
pointed out the importance of preserving the peace in Macedonia 
for the stability in the Balkans. Following the talks with 
President Gligorov, General De Lapresle stated for the 
Macedonian Radio: "UN's mission in Macedonia has a historic 
character and, owing to President Gligorov's wisdom, they 
deployed peace keeping forces as prevention for a first time. I 
would like to express gratitude to UNPROFOR soldiers and their 
commanding officers, who are directly responsible for the 
success of the mission. I especially greet General Tellefsen of 
the Nordic Battalion, the U.S. contingent, all UN monitoring 
teams, and all civilian authorities. The contingent in 
Macedonia will remain multinational with units from all nations 
previously included. We are discussing only small changes to 
replace the Swedish contingent with adequate number of U.S. 
troops. In any case, we will not take into account decisions 
opposed to agreement between the United Nations and the country 
in question. I will personally do everything in my power for 
preserving of the peace in this region," General De Lapresle 
said.

<F P=106> [Report by J.M.: "Dialogue, but Only in a Basket"] </F>
  [Text] Last night Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia -- FYROM] President Kiro Gligorov returned from a 
four-day working visit to Germany and issued the following 
statement at Skopje Airport: 
  "The visit functioned as a participation in a European forum 
where we had the opportunity of presenting our general policy 
and our views about Europe and the Balkans, about everything 
that has happened in the past two years, particularly after the 
Yugoslav crisis and the war in this region, and my opinion is 
that it was well accepted. Our stance coincides with the 
deliberations of different circles in Europe concerning the 
future actions to be undertaken with the aim of having a united 
Europe one day, when all the states will have their opportunity 
according to how they are prepared, internally and externally, 
to join such a union. 
  "The goal of the visit was to realize various contacts with 
high-ranking German politicians and my opinion is that it was 
done in the proper time, having in mind the embargo of our 
southern neighbor and all the consequences emerging from it 
inside the community itself. At the same time, we transmitted 
our views about the situation here and about the way we view the 
solution for the problems we have with the Republic of Greece. 
Not a single interlocutor could find an excuse for the measures 
undertaken by Greece against Macedonia, and on the other hand, 
it was very important that I had the opportunity of expressing 
our readiness for further discussions. We have hitherto also 
emphasized that we are ready to talk about all questions, but we 
also stressed that we could have no discussions if all the 
basket was not put on the agenda, in order not to leave anything 
unclarified that could tomorrow serve as a reason for 
misunderstandings or new embargoes.'' 
  Asked about the meeting and the discussions with Mr. Van den 
Broek, President Gligorov replied: "The meeting occurred at his 
request and we had long discussions about the ways out of this 
situation. I underlined that the basic issue was how Europe 
would find a solution for the embargo, because our stance is 
that it is not just a problem of the Macedonian-Greek border, 
but it refers to a part of the border of the European Union. 
Therefore, the responsibility of the European Union is also 
involved in this problem, because it is not a bilateral, but a 
unilateral act of a state. My opinion is that there were no 
differences in the stances, however we talked a lot about the 
possible modalities, but without reaching a firm stance on how 
to get out of that situation."

  [Text] Arber Xhaferri, chairman of the Party for Democratic 
Prosperity [PDP] in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM], called on Albanian intellectuals, political 
parties, and institutions to become engaged in the realization 
of demands of Albanians in Macedonia. 
  Addressing more than 500 people in Diber who are members and 
sympathizers of this party, Arber Xhaferri stressed that the 
former leadership of the party, together with deputies and 
ministers, has done almost nothing to realize the goals defined 
in the party program. The influence of Albanians in the state 
structures in Macedonia, as well as in the political, economic, 
security, education, and so forth, power structures, does not 
exist at all. As an example of this, the PDP chairman mentioned 
the grave situation that exists in the educational field, 
stressing that whereas in 1980 there were nine gymnasiums in 
Macedonia and 30 professional high schools, in 1992 these 
figures were reduced to five, thus marking a continuous decrease. 
  We are now in a phase of reorganizing the party and our 
ranks, Arber Xhaferri said later, stressing that now is the time 
we ask the support of Albanian intellectuals,political parties, 
and institutions to fulfill our demands. He stressed that 
Albanians in Macedonia should never cease to be state-forming 
elements and have their own special institutions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "International Committee for Arrested </F>
Albanians"] 
  [Text] The Party for Democratic Prosperity [PDP] issued a 
public announcement saying the occasional actualising of the 
so-called "arms affair" is a continuation of attempts to 
publicly discredit PDP, its parliament group, and the Albanian 
ministers in the government, thus presenting them before the 
international community as ultranationalists, terrorists, and 
forces intending to introduce instability in Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. All this is 
done by some government bodies in collaboration with other 
forces from abroad. 
  The more frequent one-sided and false presentation of PDP's 
activities and its political mechanism in part of the Macedonian 
media is just a part of such a propaganda. 
  In order to completely clarify certain dilemmas about the 
involvement of some political figures in the so-called "arms 
affair," PDP will request from authorised international 
institutions to form an international committee to deal with the 
case.

<F P=106> [Commentary by B. Geroski: "Symptomatic Exclusivity"] </F>
  [Text] The interrupted session of the communal assembly is 
expected to be resumed in Tetovo today, when the board members 
will discuss the recent arrests of four citizens of Albanian 
nationality who were caught with a considerable quantity of 
firearms. The PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] and the NDP 
[People's Democratic Party] link this case to the "paramilitary 
army" affair and demand the release of those arrested, as well 
as the liberation of the group accused of creating paramilitary 
formations. 
  Interior Minister Ljubomir Frckovski's attempt to persuade 
the Tetovo board members at the first (interrupted) session that 
the latest arrests had nothing to do with the affair, and thus 
had no political background, was obviously inadequate. Today, 
the Justice and Administration Minister, Tuse Gosev, is expected 
in Tetovo. However, it is still an open question whether the new 
round of pressure will produce any results. 
  According to the latest information of the PDP and NDP, and 
the Democratic Forum for Protection of Human Freedoms and Rights 
in Macedonia, located in Gostivar, any serious discussion of the 
case was undermined from the outset. That is, the leading 
political formations of the Albanians in Macedonia saw the 
latest arrests as factor in the affair, as an attempt to 
discredit the PDP, as a manipulated political process, an 
organized action against the Albanians, as a great provocation, 
and so on. Since the event has been characterized in such 
political terms, one can expect that today's discussion between 
the Tetovo board members and the representatives of the 
executive authority will develop into a discussion between the 
deaf. 
  The case of those arrested in Tetovo (four) and Gostivar 
(two) is clean, at least as far as concerns the police. They 
are all accused under Article 218 of the Macedonian Criminal 
Code -- the carrying of arms and explosives is prohibited. The 
Tetovo group was, for instance, caught with 28 firearms 
(automatic rifles) and 10 bombs. Nonetheless, the straight 
description of the deed refers to data in which the authorities 
do not link it with the "paramilitary soldiers." Therein lies 
the dilemma -- why do the PDP and NDP do so? 
  We can to some extent understand the strength of feeling in 
the political representative body of Albanians in Macedonia, and 
the fact that all cases are seen through the prism of the PDP's 
internal party conflicts. However, does this mean that arms 
smugglers will no longer be affected by law if they are 
Albanians because they might be connected with the "paramilitary 
army" affair? Can anybody in this state be granted such an 
exclusive position? Finally, is it permissible to ask for 
Macedonian state bodies (administration) to be substituted with 
an international commission, not to allow for the possible 
monitoring of the events in the "paramilitary army" affair 
(which could be accepted), but for "clarifying the case"?

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Electoral Package-Law Adopted"] </F>
  [Text] During a yesterday session, the Macedonian [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Government 
adopted the package-law on elections. They discussed and 
determined the proposed law on electing president of the 
country. This law states the country's president will be 
elected during general, direct, and secret voting, for a 5-year 
mandate. It will take a group of at least 10,000 voters or 30 
parliament deputies to nominate a presidential candidate. If no 
candidate gets the necessary majority of votes in the first 
rounds of election, the second round will include the two 
candidates with biggest number of votes from the first round. 
  The Government also adopted the proposal on changes in the 
law on appointing and replacing parliament deputies and 
committee members. The Macedonian Parliament will be consisted 
of 140 deputies. 120 of them will be elected by the majority 
principle, and the remaining one by the proportionate one. The 
number of members in township committees will be determined by a 
Statute. The news in this law is that the second round of 
elections will include only candidates who have gotten at least 
12 percent of the total number of voters in the first round. 
  Government members also adopted the proposed law on 
political 
parties, regulating procedure and conditions for founding, 
registering and ceasing to exist of political parties. The law 
allows no registering of parties with a program, statute, or 
activities aimed to forcefully overthrow the government, urging 
or calling to military aggression, and introducing religious, 
national, or racial hatred or intolerance. 
  The package of laws is expected to appear on the parliament 
agenda during its 74th session, announced for March 29.

<F P=106> [Report by V.M.B.: "Inflation Is Losing Breath"] </F>
  [Text] What can be said for sure is that slowly but 
surely, matters are moving toward the better, at least as far as 
the bogeyman called inflation and the stampede of the denar's 
exchange rate is concerned. Inflation, at least according to 
last month's indicators, is slowly easing. The rate is not only 
at a nearly complete standstill, but the black market, as an 
indicator of all the movements in the country, is slowly losing 
its breath. 
  After the January shock, when a 22-percent inflation came to 
light, which did not coincide with what had been planned in the 
Government Stabilization Program (to have an inflation below 10 
percent in the first months, around 5 percent in the middle of 
the year, and around 3 percent at the end), the dose of optimism 
that matters would start improving returned the figures of the 
last month's rate of inflation to around 6 percent, which is 
only 0.8 percent over the plan. According to the announcements 
of statisticians, the fall of inflation will be even greater in 
the next months, certainly if some unpredictable disturbances 
don't occur. Thus, an inflation of only 2.5 percent is foreseen 
for July, which will fulfill the plans -- to reduce last year's 
inflation rate of 300 percent to an annual level of 70 percent! 
  If this becomes our reality, we shall finally take a break 
in 
the race with inflation that we have felt in the past months of 
this year, concerning the exchange rate of the domestic 
currency. The exchange rate, the official one, according to the 
information we got from the Macedonian National Bank, is real, 
and the black market exchange rate is on almost the same level. 
  Taking into consideration its stability, as Dusanka 
Hristova, 
general manager of the sector for foreign currency system and 
policy of the Macedonian National Bank said, the Central Bank 
has not intervened at all in the foreign currency market this 
year with the aim of maintaining the rate. Since the official 
and black market rates are close, according to what Hristova 
said, the number of those purchasing foreign currency on the 
street is smaller, and on the other hand, the inflow of foreign 
currency from authorized exchange bureaus has been increased. 
  That is certainly one of the reasons for the fact that the 
black market is losing its breath, and it influences the 
decrease of money circulation, according to the planned 
proportions adjusted to the International Monetary Fund.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has stressed the 
inadequacy of shaping and sharing contemporary and universal 
values on paper, adding that the international community should 
collectively establish a new order in which peace, cooperation, 
and prosperity will reign. Demirel, on an official visit in 
Bucharest, participated in the dinner Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu gave in his honor this evening. TRT correspondent Mesut 
Ertugay reports from Bucharest: 
  [Begin recording] [Ertugay] Demirel, on an official visit in 
Bucharest, participated in the dinner Iliescu gave in his honor. 
During the speech he delivered at the dinner, Demirel indicated 
that Romania and Turkey, which share the same geography, 
historical neighborhood, and friendship, also share a common 
future. Explaining that the relations between the two countries 
are based on respect and security between states and love and 
understanding between the peoples, Demirel said that 
strengthening this friendship bridge will further common 
interests. 
  Demirel said extremist movements and aggressive nationalism 
are threatening state structures and causing wars in various 
parts of the world these days. Noting that international 
organizations are ineffective in fighting circles which are the 
cause of instability, Demirel stated that regional clashes cast 
a shadow over agreements. Demirel stressed that under these 
circumstances great duties befall Turkey and Romania. Demirel 
said: 
  [Demirel] We cannot accept that [word indistinct] in our 
region be made a center for instability like in the past. The 
first condition for this is that all regional states respect 
each others' territorial integrity and avoid making the existing 
border issues a reason for discussion. The geographical and 
historical realities of the Balkans do not permit additional 
ruptures. 
  [Ertugay] Recalling that the borders of the political 
geography in the Balkans were reshaped with the countries that 
emerged following Yugoslavia's dissolution, Demirel said that 
now the main concern should be to find a permanent solution to 
the human shame being lived in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Noting that 
the developments achieved under the leadership of the United 
States are very satisfactory, Demirel said that the Bosnian 
Serbs should also show the same political maturity as the 
Bosnians and the Croats. Demirel said: 
  [Demirel] Serbia and Nagorno-Karabakh, within today's 
borders, should take their rightful place among the Balkan 
countries. We will establish our future jointly and with the 
voluntary contribution of all our neighbors. Solidarity will 
take the place of clashes in our region. [passage indistinct] 
  [Ergutay] Iliescu, in turn, voiced Romania's concern over 
the clashes in the region. Iliescu stated that the clashes, the 
loss of lives, and the refugee drama in the former Yugoslav 
territories are preventing the people from having better living 
conditions and are adverse to democratic goals. Pointing out 
that Yugoslavia supports efforts toward finding a just solution 
to the issue, Iliescu added that they believe that a continuous 
security system should be established in Europe. Within this 
framework, Iliescu stated, they view the NATO as the sole 
organization which has the capability of establishing security 
in Europe. Indicating that Turkey and Romania have 
outstandingly good relations which have their roots based in 
history, Iliescu added that they greatly appreciate the Turkish 
people's readiness to share their economic and social success.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has been continuing his 
contacts in Romania. Stressing that Turkey wants stability in 
the Balkans and in Europe, Demirel indicated that once the 
two-year human shame in Bosnia-Herzegovina is eradicated, the 
region will enter a new cooperation environment. This morning 
Demirel held a news conference in Bucharest where he is on an 
official visit. TRT correspondent Ertugrul Bulent Danaci 
reports from Bucharest: 
  [Danaci] Demirel held a news conference at the Turkish 
Embassy in Bucharest on the second day of his visit and answered 
Turkish correspondents' questions. 
  Pointing out that his contacts in Bucharest were very 
favorable, Demirel stated that Turkey and Romania have no 
problems and that a state-to-state and people-to-people 
friendship exists between the two countries. Explaining that 
the infrastructure which will constitute the basis of the 
bilateral relations has been in preparation for the last four 
years, Demirel recalled that several agreements were signed 
within this framework. 
  Demirel said that Turkey, a Balkan country and therefore a 
European country, aspires to a peaceful solution to the problems 
within the Balkan countries. Indicating that today Europe is 
faced with a security issue, Demirel said that the CSCE is part 
of this issue and that the CSCE could not function as expected 
during the Bosnia-Herzegovina situation. 
  Pointing to raised hopes in terms of things running smoothly 
in the world after the Soviet Union's dissolution, Demirel 
recalled that this was not achieved. In spite of all this, 
Demirel stressed, regional countries should work toward a 
composed and long-term cooperation for the happiness of their 
people. Within this framework, Demirel added, Turkey and 
Romania have good cooperation. 
  Recalling that Turkey supports Romania's inclusion in the 
European organizations, Demirel noted that Romania was the first 
country to sign the Partnership for Peace agreement with NATO. 
  Wishing Romania success in its efforts toward democracy and 
market economy, Demirel said that Turkey and Romania have good 
relations within the framework of the Black Sea Economic 
Cooperation [BSEC]. Demirel announced that following his 
meetings with the concerned heads of state, he would call for a 
BSEC summit meeting. 
  Answering a reporter's question on Turkey's depreciation by 
international financial institution, Demirel said that he cannot 
comment on Turkey's credit points dropping from 3B to 2B, since 
it was meaningless, and added that credits to be extended to 
Turkey should not be measured according to the B's. Demirel 
said: God help us if we are indexed to the B's. Turkey has 
difficulties and we have to accept them. Would we not have any 
difficulties if we had not dropped from 3B to 2B? I think that 
you should all believe that we are going to overcome these 
difficulties. Turkey will overcome all these difficulties. 
  Demirel will continue with his contacts in Bucharest in the 
afternoon.

  [Text] At the Metropolitan Hill Palace [parliament 
headquarters] today, Suleyman Demirel, president of the Republic 
of Turkey, who yesterday began a visit in our country, addressed 
a joint session of the two chambers of the Romanian parliament. 
  The festive occasion was opened by Chamber of Deputies 
Speaker Adrian Nastase, who emphasized the fact that our 
countries have a long joint history and today they have found 
each other again in [words indistinct] turning it into a joint 
source of further development. Nastase also said that the visit 
to Romania of the head of the Turkish state and of the 
delegation he is heading has a special significance both for the 
two countries and for our neighbors. 
  In his speech Turkish President Suleyman Demirel recognized 
the road left behind by our country after December 1989 on its 
way to pluralist democracy and market economy, a road which, as 
is only natural, is also full of obstacles; to overcome them one 
needs determination, patience, understanding, effort and time, 
Demirel said. 
  Talking about the evolution of cooperative relations between 
Romania and Turkey, Demirel said that it is characterized by 
mutual respect, the will to know each other better and increase 
efforts to further cooperation, and the sentiment of solidarity 
in difficult moments. In that context he mentioned the fact 
that Turkey currently ranks sixth in Romania's total trade 
dealings, and in fourth place in relation to the number of 
foreign companies investing in our country. 
  Reviewing the principal events in current international 
affairs, the head of the Turkish state noted that the peace 
process budding in the Middle East represents a hope that will 
influence the future of the entire area, after which he asserted 
that in the southern parts of Turkey there are possibilities for 
new cooperation. 
  Concerning the transformation currently occurring in the 
central and eastern parts of Europe, Demirel pointed out that 
the projected Partnership for Peace ensures the security and 
stability of Europe and adjacent areas, adding that his country 
learned with satisfaction about the fact that Romania was the 
first state to sign that accord. 
  On relations in the Balkans, the Turkish president said that 
some of the countries in that region are facing difficulties 
created by their transition to democracy and a free market 
economy and by certain ethnic problems that cause tension among 
the countries in that area. 
  After mentioning the fact that last week in Washington an 
accord was signed by Bosnian Muslims and Croatians, who decided 
to live together, Demirel appealed to the Serbs to join that 
process to contribute to the reestablishment of peace and 
cooperation on the soil of the former Yugoslavia. He also 
requested that the nations in the Balkans support this 
opportunity that has been created and ensure a growing hope for 
peace, so that it can spread throughout the region. 
  In concluding his speech, referring again to our bilateral 
cooperation, the Turkish president pointed out that his country 
and Romania are two large countries in this area and they are 
developing their cooperation in a way that can be seen as an 
example for the entire region.

<F P=106> [Video report by Mesut Ertugay from Bucharest] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] In a news conference at the 
Turkish Embassy in Bucharest today, President Suleyman Demirel 
commented on the recent developments with regard to the Turkish 
troops to be sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Demirel recalled that 
until now Turkey has always acted together with the rest of the 
world and contributed to UN services rendered for peaceful 
purposes. 
  Underlining the senselessness of the opposition to sending 
Turkish troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina, the president declared: 
Why should Turkish troops not be sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
Greece is opposed to this on the grounds that it does not want 
neighbors to be involved. Is this the real issue? Actually, it 
is not, but the matter has been settled. [passage omitted] 
  Demirel said that a draft free trade agreement was submitted 
to Romania. The two sides also focused on cooperation in the 
fields of transportation, free trade zones, energy, tourism, 
promotion of investments, and the prevention of pollution in the 
Black Sea, Demirel recounted. The president said that he 
conveyed to Romania Turkey's views concerning safe passage 
through the Turkish straits. 
  [Begin Demirel recording] The current question consists of 
passage through the Istanbul and Canakkale straits. Soon it 
will be impossible to cross these straits. Currently there are 
50,000 ships passing through the Istanbul strait. Within three 
or four years, especially following the dissolution of the 
Soviet Union, when Ukraine, Russia, and other countries will 
want to reach world markets and vice versa, this number is 
expected to reach 100,000. If you attempt to transport 100 or 
200 million tonnes of oil via the straits, you will fail 
totally. This is impossible. Therefore, this matter does not 
only concern us. It is our concern only because of other 
countries' free commercial passage right through the straits. 
If, however, the straits are clogged, the right to free passage 
will automatically disappear. [end recording] 
  Demirel announced that Turkey has conveyed a technical 
statute formulated with the aim of guaranteeing safe passage 
through the straits to the relevant countries. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that the 
Romania and Turkey have the political will necessary to further 
their relations, adding that investors in both countries should 
make the most of it. TRT correspondent Mesut Ertugay reports 
from Bucharest: 
  [Begin Ertugay recording] Demirel received Romanian Prime 
Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu at the state guest house. Demirel 
stated that there is a great potential for furthering 
Turkish-Romanian relations in spite of difficulties and [word 
indistinct] situation. Pointing out that cooperation needs 
constant care, Demirel added that the two countries should ease 
the way for businessmen by eliminating their difficulties. 
  The Romanian prime minister, in turn, expressed his 
appreciation for Turkey's support in spite of all the 
difficulties. Stressing the importance Romania gives to 
furthering its relations with Turkey, Vacaroiu indicated that 
they aim to double the present $500 million trade volume. 
  Demirel and Romanian President Ion Iliescu inaugurated the 
Turkish-Romanian Bank established jointly by the two countries 
in Bucharest. Demirel said that the bank was similar to a door 
opening to further the relations between the two countries. He 
congratulated the partners of the bank for their initiative. 
Demirel noted that the businessmen will not only support 
investments in Romania and Turkey but also in a third country. 
  The Romanian president, in turn, said that the bank is a 
great step in the relations between the two countries and that 
it will make a significant contribution. Later the two 
presidents opened the first two bank accounts at the bank. 
  The Turkish-Romanian Bank, which will accommodate the trade 
area, was established with capital of approximately $4.5 
million. Eighty percent of the capital belongs to the [word 
indistinct] and 20 percent belongs to the Romanian Trade Bank. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin met with his 
Romanian counterpart Teodor Viorel Melescanu. The meetings 
focused on the situation in the Balkans and the establishment of 
a federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina to achieve a permanent peace. 
  According to information obtained by a TRT correspondent, 
Cetin asked for the Romanian Government's help in influencing 
the Serbs to participate in the agreement signed between the 
Bosnians and the Croats. It was reported that the Romanians 
received this request favorably. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu article: ""Why Did the PDSR-Opposition </F>
Dialogue Fail?"] 
  [Text] At the news conference of the National Peasant 
Christian Democratic Party of Romania [PNTCD] on 14 March, the 
spokesman of that party announced that [PNTCD leader] Corneliu 
Coposu will no longer continue the dialogue with the Social 
Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. Also on Monday, during his 
news conference, Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu said that, in 
practical terms, a PDSR-CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania] 
alliance is impossible. Shortly before that, PDSR leader Adrian 
Nastase also expressed skepticism as far as the effectiveness of 
the dialogue with the CDR is concerned. From a practical point 
of view, these declarations represent the official funeral of 
the PDSR-opposition dialogue. I say the official funeral 
because as a matter of fact, this dialogue died when the 
government reshuffle was announced. At that moment it became 
clear that the reshuffle would give a fatal blow to the delicate 
process of rapprochement between the PDSR and the opposition, 
first of all because the reshuffle defied one of the claims of 
the CDR and the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) 
[PD(FSN)] -- not to remove Nicolae Spiroiu from the helm of the 
Ministry of National Defense -- and second, because the 
reshuffle took place in the middle of the dialogue that had just 
started between the PDSR and the opposition. The fact that the 
PDSR proceeded to a government reshuffle without even bothering 
to discuss it with the opposition represented clear proof that 
the openness toward the right wing was not taken seriously by 
Ion Iliescu's party. The idea of starting a dialogue between 
the PDSR and the opposition parties was received with great 
satisfaction and mainly with great hopes by the entire Romanian 
society. Taking into consideration the dispute between the PDSR 
and the nationalist-communist forces, the opening of this 
dialogue justified the belief in a major change at all levels of 
Romania's political life. While it was taking place, the 
dialogue enjoyed the support of independent politicians, 
journalists, and the public. A recent opinion poll by the IRSOP 
[Romanian Institute for Public Opinion Poll] shows that 60 
percent of those who were questioned are in favor of a 
government that includes both the PDSR and the opposition. 
Taking into account also the possibility that this opinion 
poll, just like all the others made by the IRSOP so far, might 
be just a diversion, nevertheless the 60 percent rate shows us 
that Romania's population views the dialogue between the PDSR 
and the opposition favorably. The reason for the enthusiasm 
brought about by the opening of dialogue can be found in the 
complex reality currently prevailing in our country. It is clear 
that, in spite of all the propaganda declarations made by Prime 
Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and by some leaders of the ruling 
party, the serious effects of a political-economic bottleneck 
are being felt at all economic levels and by the whole society. 
This bottleneck is the result of a slow but continuous change 
within the ruling party. The PDSR started off as an 
antireformist party in the electoral campaign and won elections 
on this basis. Later the PDSR realized the domestic and 
international realities that are resolutely demanding the 
continuation of the reform. Even if it wanted to act 
differently, the ruling party could not oppose some serious but 
necessary decisions that have been taken in connection with 
increases in prices, unemployment, and in the fiscal area. Due 
to its move to the right, the ruling party came into 
contradiction with its allies. The current majority coalition 
is dominated by nationalist-communist forces. These forces 
exist and are felt not only in the Greater Romania Party [PRM], 
the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM], the Romanian National Unity 
Party [PUNR], and the Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania 
[PDAR], but also in the PDSR. As a result of this, all the laws 
of the reform have been voted with great difficulty in the 
parliament. A significant number of similar laws are waiting in 
vain to be discussed. The implementation of the laws of the 
reform meets with serious opposition because of the bureaucracy 
that engulfs the entire state apparatus and the leadership of 
enterprises. This bureaucracy has gotten stronger and reached 
spectacular proportions through the alliance of the PDSR with 
the left-wing parties. The great majority of those who were 
moved by the wave of the December 1989 revolution has been 
removed. They were replaced by former second- and third-rate 
nomenclatura members of the Ceausescu period. A bureaucratic 
mentality is a typical characteristic of those former 
nomenclatura members. This means that they are scared of 
changes, they lack initiative, and have confidence -- something 
they hide with difficulty -- in the economic centralism. From 
all this, one can draw the conclusion that no matter how 
reformist the ruling party might have become, its intentions are 
hampered by an incontestable political reality, namely, the 
nationalist-communist character of the majority coalition and 
the useless but stubborn resistance of the bureaucratic forces 
that are in the middle of a restoration process. Under these 
conditions, the political-economic bottleneck is perfectly 
explainable. Both economy and politics are virtually paralyzed. 
The way out of the blockage could have been achieved only 
through a new formula of parliamentary majority, a formula in 
which the reformist forces would have dominated the coalition on 
which the government relies. This parliamentary majority that 
would have been established as a result of the PDSR-CDR and 
PD(FSN) alliance would have had also the immense advantage of 
boasting an overwhelming proportion in the parliament. The laws 
of the reform would have been adopted much more rapidly and much 
more efficiently. At the same time, the new coalition would have 
created a new atmosphere throughout the entire Romanian society. 
Under the power of the new political wave, the reformist forces 
in our country would have gained courage, while the bureaucratic 
and the antireformist forces would have lost ground. 
Unfortunately, not only for our political life but also for the 
whole Romanian social life, the PDSR-opposition dialogue did not 
justify people's hopes. Was this the normal thing to happen? 
Was it normal that the dialogue was not carried to the end? 
  I believe that, looking logically at our social and 
political realities, the answer is affirmative. However, it is 
fatal that the dialogue did not to continue. The real reasons 
might be the following: 
  A. The presence of a gap between Ion Iliescu and the PDSR on 
the one hand and the CDR-PD(FSN) on the other. In the years 
that have passed since the December 1989 events, the 
contradiction between the opposition and those who grabbed the 
power has increased every day. In the beginning, the FSN and 
later the PDSR arranged numerous acts of diversion against the 
opposition and used the opposition as a target for violent 
accusations. In turn, the opposition contested the legitimacy 
of the new leadership and sometimes pleaded for its removal by 
force. Under the specific conditions prevailing in Romania 
after 1989 December events, the antagonism between the two 
political forces overstepped the borders of a normal democratic 
confrontation. The more so since in 1990 the battle reached the 
level of "who is knocking out whom." At one point, each of the 
two forces proposed to eliminate its rival. The fact that the 
electorate that supported the two political forces polarized to 
an amazing extent made things even more serious. Thus, a gap of 
suspicion was created, not only between the two political forces 
but also between the two electorates. This gap got broader when 
the nationalist-communist forces made an appearance on our 
political scene. The PDSR and Ion Iliescu did not have the 
power to rapidly detach themselves from these forces. 
Therefore, it seemed that the communist-nationalists were 
talking in the name of the PDSR and Ion Iliescu. As a result of 
it, the violent nature of the nationalist- communist attacks was 
perceived by the opposition as coming from the PDSR and Ion 
Iliescu. One can not easily overcome this gap. This was 
admitted also by one of the PNTCD leaders at the end of the 
first round of talks with the PDSR when he said that there is a 
difficult psychological threshold to cross. This psychological 
threshold belongs not only to the opposition but also to its 
electorate. It is extremely difficult to convince your 
supporters that it is possible to negotiate with the PDSR and 
with Ion Iliescu, when after for years on end you told them that 
the PDSR is a neo-communist party and Ion Iliescu must be 
removed. However, reasoning in this way, it was still a mistake 
to start a dialogue. It would have been much better if, in a 
first stage, secret contacts would have been made, far from the 
eyes of the public. Some compromise could have been reached, 
without the sides having their own electorate breathing down 
their necks. Likewise, the rapprochement between the PDSR and 
the opposition should have started through temporary alliances, 
discussions, and the voting of certain laws that would have been 
convenient both for the moderate wing of the PDSR and the 
opposition. Thus, a psychological ground would have been 
prepared for the opening of an official dialogue. Since this is 
not the way things were done, the shock of change of atmosphere 
between the two political forces was strong enough to make the 
two electorates apprehensive and to make the personal vanity and 
interests come out in the forefront. 
  B. The confusion that continues to prevail within the ruling 
party. It is clear that the reason for opening the dialogue was 
the presence of a reformist group within the PDSR. This group 
is aware of the internal and external danger posed by an 
alliance with the nationalist-communist forces. Therefore, 
through victory over the whole conservative majority, this group 
forced the whole party to get closer to the CDR and distance 
itself from the nationalist- communist forces. However, this 
reformist group is a minority group within the PDSR. Apart from 
being a minority group, it mainly includes opportunist 
politicians, who are ready to do everything in order to stay in 
power. Thus, the opening of a dialogue with the opposition took 
place under difficult circumstances for the reformist group. It 
would have been normal for this group to definitively win in the 
party and put the conservative majority to its place. There 
would even have been a chance for a part of the conservative 
group to move toward the left-wing parties. Not being able to 
win within the party, the reformist group saw in the opening of 
a dialogue with the opposition an opportunity to strengthen its 
position within the PDSR. Thus, the opening of the dialogue did 
not take place prior to some clarifications in the government 
party. The reformist group did not consider the opening of the 
dialogue as the final stage in the process of clarifications, 
but as a beginning of such a process. Thus, the reformist group 
was compelled to hold negotiations with the opposition while 
extreme pressure was being put on it by the conservative 
majority, and through this majority by the whole PDSR. It is 
easy to understand that, in such a situation, the reformist 
group had small room for maneuver when it came to accepting 
certain compromise with the opposition. That is the reason for 
the sudden rigid position adopted by the PDSR during the 
negotiations and for that party's apprehension that its move 
closer to the opposition should not lead to the definitive 
breach with nationalist-communist forces. It is more than 
certain that any spectacular modification of the PDSR policy 
would have caused the split of the party. 
  Being apprehensive about the policy promoted by the 
reformist group, the conservatives would have filled the ranks 
of the PRM, the PSM, and the PUNR. The reformist group would 
have faced the risk of losing everything. On the one hand, 
because of the psychological gap, the negotiations with the 
opposition would have been dragged in time, while on the other 
hand the PDSR would have lost its parliamentary majority. 
Likewise, taking into consideration the opportunism of certain 
leaders of the reformist group, it is easy to understand that, 
at one point, they were afraid of the dialogue. The government 
reshuffle was the signal that finally this group gave in. It 
returned to the previously occupied positions, that is, a 
minority position, compared with the majority of PDSR members 
and the supporters of that party. 
  C. The lack of a strong left wing. As I have already 
written, the PDSR and the CDR cannot establish an alliance 
except when a new disturbing common adversary makes its 
appearance. This adversary is none else than the a possible 
PSM, PRM, PUNR, and PDAR alliance against the PDSR. However, 
these parties are still rather weak and do not dare rise against 
the strong protector of the PDSR, namely Ion Iliescu. 
Therefore, their recent attempt to detach themselves from the 
PDSR, an attempt that was expressed in the PRM leadership's 
letter, was quite flimsy. At the first signs of anger showed by 
the PDSR and Ion Iliescu, the left-wing allies rapidly calmed 
down. Pretending to be satisfied that the reshuffle has solved 
their interests, the PRM, the PSM, the PUNR, and the PDAR 
returned to their previously set condition: to humiliate the 
satellites of the ruling party. Since the PDSR did not have a 
firm and unfailing response to its allies, it would have been a 
mistake if it insisted to departing from the left wing and come 
closer to the right wing. No matter how discrediting they are, 
these allies are still preferable to the opposition. They are 
pleased with small measures, while the opposition wants almost 
everything. The common adversary of the PDSR and the CDR has 
not made its appearance yet. It is still to be seen whether it 
is able to appear soon.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Leopold Moravcik: "A Signal for Slovakia"] </F>
  [Text] In the message of congratulations addressed by U.S. 
President Bill Clinton to Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik, 
the following sentence attracted my attention: "In the spirit of 
our recent successful meeting in Prague, I am looking forward to 
cooperation with you in support of our common targets in shaping 
a new, integrated Europe that is democratic, safe, prosperous, 
and free." Though it is possible to glean a lot from the dry 
words of a message of congratulations about the attitude of 
another country's representative toward an up-and-coming 
politician, it is not customary for the one who congratulates to 
also assume a stand on domestic political developments and to 
lean toward one side in the struggle between two opinions. 
  President Clinton did that. 
  We still remember well the words of former Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar, in which he called President Michal Kovac's 
activity during the meeting with Bill Clinton in Prague a 
"wasted opportunity," with reference, among other things, to 
negative reactions of the U.S. side. 
  President Clinton did not have to use the expression 
"successful meeting in Prague" in his congratulatory message. 
Nonetheless, he did, thereby entering, apparently consciously, 
into the Kovac-Meciar conflict. The course of action by the 
Slovak delegation during this meeting was not necessarily 
flawless, yet the President of the United States wants it to be 
considered successful, which he made publicly known. 
  President Clinton thus sent a clear and easily 
understandable 
signal to Slovakia--a signal for the new government and also for 
the opposition.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jan Benes: "About Deputy Minister Kalousek's </F>
`Expedient Lie'"] 
  [Text] In the course of an extraordinary news conference 
called by the defense minister to calm down the public, Deputy 
Defense Minister Kalousek described the CESKY DENIK information 
about contributing to Klinlab equipment with Army supplies as an 
expedient lie. The deputy minister is apparently well-versed in 
the field so he knew what he was talking about. What he said 
was an expedient untruth. 
  This time around, we will not devote our attention to the 
problem of biological warfare agents (because, at this time, the 
explanation of the difference between offensive and defensive 
cholera is beyond our ability). 
  We will leave that for some other time, including the 
military laboratories in Olesnice, as well as the equipment for 
the reproduction of viruses, with which the Techonin Research 
Institute was equipped, despite the claims made by the Defense 
Ministry officials calming down the public. After all, it was 
from here that the Bulgarian, Romanian, GDR, and Russian 
experts, who used to work here, withdrew their research and 
documentation. 
  So, that is one group of expedient untruths. Let us, 
however, devote ourselves to the Klinlab Co., a company that 
operates in the building of the Military Hospital in 
[Prague-]Stresovice. It was precisely in the facility leased to 
Klinlab that the bank of "completely common viruses" was located 
that was destroyed on Defense Minister Baudys's order under 
extraordinary security measures. 
  First, already in 1992, expensive foreign-made equipment was 
bought for the Central Military Health Institution--a laboratory 
glass washer, for instance, and an automatic analyzer--just to 
guarantee a good future for the Central Military Hospital [UVN]. 
The purchases were made by the deputy chief of the Central 
Military Health Institution (UVZU), Dr. Moravek. The 
justification was that UVZU would produce and market 
hygienically pure water for commercial purposes. Shortly 
thereafter, however, a questionnaire was circulated among the 
employees of this institution recruiting "experts" for the 
future private laboratory institute called Klinlab. The 
questionnaire was then used to justify (the people want it) the 
establishment of Klinlab. This company assumed, however, only 
the profit-making or profit-promising part of UVZU. Under the 
auspices of Economics Deputy Minister Kalousek, the company was 
authorized to manage the six-floor facility in UVN by a contract 
dated 10 September 1993 and signed with the Army for Klinlab by 
no one else but Dr. Moravek, still an officer on active duty. 
He signed as the executive secretary of a company that had not 
yet been founded, much less registered. 
  This violates a good number of laws and regulations, 
including the defense minister's order No. 9 of 11 February 1993. 
  Only a month after the signing of the lease (which leaves 
the 
owner with the obligations of the owner, including construction 
alterations), on 11 October 1993, the Klinlab company contract 
was signed, and only on 23 October 1993 is Klinlab entered on 
the company register. 
  In a state governed by rule of law, the contract would 
certainly be invalid. In a state governed by rule of law, the 
people signing such contracts would be considered cheats. 
Furthermore, Dr. Moravek and all of the other officers from 
Klinlab Ltd. who signed the contract brazenly violated Law 
143/1992 in its Article 3, Section 4 of the government 
instruction, according to which they are paid their salaries 
with 25-percent bonuses provided they do not engage in business 
but only serve in the Army! 
  The Klinlab lease contract (let us assume that the same 
ministerial office is responsible for its organization, which 
refused other privatization projects, including one from Canada) 
rents the relevant part of UVN for 720,123 korunas [Kc] annually 
to the, of course, not-yet-existing legal entity, and the money 
was then lent to them interest-free for a fixed term--i.e., 
until the purchase contract is signed. All of that happens on 1 
December 1993. Material and supplies worth dozens of millions is 
passed on to Klinlab without inventory, and, when an inventory 
is taken of the furniture and equipment, it is calculated at 
write-off prices. Regarding the laboratory equipment valued at 
approximately Kc30 million, then, Klinlab chooses what it needs, 
and purchases (until the date of the purchase contract, it will 
use it free of charge) the equipment at a later date. 
  So, this is the expedient lie about Engineer Kalousek, of 
which we are guilty. 
  The military equipment that was profitable for the Army, 
including the equipment purchased for taxpayer's money, will 
pass into private hands. The money-losing equipment will be 
kept by the Army. 
  Of course, some soldiers wanted to object. That was an 
ill-advised idea. After all, the appropriate commission 
investigated it. Even Colonel Krizenecky put his iron in the 
fire, and so did Military Prosecutor Dr. Novak. The same one 
who was investigating but never concluded the investigation of 
the activities of another man of the Kalousek-type at the 
Defense Ministry, the current director of the Nase Vojsko [Our 
Army] publishing house, Jakub Cisar--of course, that was still 
in the Orbis publishing house. 
  We will reach the stage of socialism in our country, we will 
be successful in defending the peace, and we will thwart the 
iniquitous activities of traitors, and so on along the arduous 
path toward a better tomorrow. The officers will get paid (by 
us, friends) for not engaging in business. They conduct 
business (with our money). Are we to believe that the sale of 
microbes, eventually to be thrown into a synagogue as an 
example, presents a problem for such enterprising entrepreneurs?

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz by Francoise </F>
Delstanche; date and place not given: "Arpad Goncz: `Hungary's 
Priorities Will Stay the Same'"] 
  [Text] The Hungarian president believes that Eastern Europe 
will become a major market for the European Union (EU) provided 
that the EU consents to open up its markets. 
  A striking figure on the Hungarian literary scene, President 
Arpad Goncz is certainly the most popular political figure in 
his country. A renowned former opponent of the communist 
regime, he is highly respected and represents a kind of moral 
authority in the country. For two years now he has devoted 
himself to defending one of the key pillars of democracy: 
freedom of the press. In this interview he presents his views 
on this subject as well as on the rapprochement between his 
country and the EU to L'ECHO. At this juncture, it should be 
noted that on Tuesday the Hungarian parliament gave the green 
light to the government to submit an official application for EU 
membership. That will be done this 1 April, Hungarian Prime 
Minister Peter Boross announced. 
  [Delstanche] Your country would like to join the EU and 
NATO. 
Do you, like Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, think that 1999 
will be too late to join the EU? 
  [Goncz] Yes, I share this view entirely. We would like to 
join as soon as possible so as to anchor our position among the 
Western economic system. However, accession also means 
integration in a security system. Our security does not 
necessarily have to be guaranteed by NATO. However, the role of 
the WEU has not yet been clarified, no more than that of the 
Atlantic Alliance. 
  Nevertheless, we believe that our security should not 
necessarily be regarded exclusively from the military point of 
view, but rather considered from a social, material, economic 
viewpoint, which also implies economic development. 
  Meanwhile, the Partnership for Peace has constituted a very 
important step forward toward greater security, first because it 
is an open system and because that means there can be a certain 
amount of differentiation between the various countries, and 
second, because the various possible forms of cooperation mean 
that it can be adapted to local peculiarities. 
  [Delstanche] Does firing 129 journalists from the state 
radio 
represent a method that is compatible with Western norms 
regarding the freedom of the press? 
  [Goncz] The important thing is to understand that it is 
compatible with the norms regarding freedom of the press as 
enshrined in the Hungarian Constitution. The provisions of the 
Hungarian Constitution stipulate quite unambiguously that the 
freedom of the press be respected, as must citizens' rights to 
express their opinions. Since until now we have not had any law 
governing the media, a law that sets out the situation and 
position regarding electronic media, for the time being it is up 
to the government to ensure the impartiality of the media while 
we wait for such a law to be enacted. I fervently hope that the 
government will meet this obligation. 
  I would like to add that in Hungary we have set up a 
democratic institutional system. This system is working, but in 
a fledgling democracy there is also a need to learn the 
unwritten rules, which takes some time. I am not certain that 
the preelectoral period is the best time to learn them. 
  [Delstanche] Hungary is often cited as the pioneer of 
economic and political reforms in Central and Eastern Europe. 
However, the discontentment seems to be increasing, not only in 
the political arena, but also at the economic level. What 
adjustments do you intend to make to your economic strategy? 
  [Goncz] We were indeed pioneers regarding economic 
transformation, for the reforms introduced in Hungary preceded 
those launched in other countries by roughly 10 years. And I am 
absolutely certain that there will be no drastic change. 
Firstly, because we have three priorities at the economic 
level: We must bring inflation under control, get to grips with 
the budget deficit, and reduce the rate of unemployment. 
  These three objectives are calling for compromises on a 
daily 
basis. This means to say that any government which comes to 
power will be obliged to take account of economic realities. 
  It is true that at the economic level, society was expecting 
a greater share of the new power. However, it started out with 
a sizeable foreign debt. Moreover, the country, the government, 
and society were no more prepared for the collapse of the 
markets in the East than they were for the economic decline that 
has prevailed in Western Europe. 
  Throughout the region the crisis is rampant, and we will 
only 
have put the situation behind us when we manage to increase 
production, which has dropped in all the countries. In 
addition, our region will constitute the largest market for 
Western Europe in the near future. However, for us to be able 
to welcome its products and prove to be solvent, the Western 
markets must definitely be opened up. To have one market, 
another market must be assured in return. That is in our common 
interests. 
  [Delstanche] The polls are predicting that the Socialist 
Party will win the elections. Do you accept the interpretation 
according to which the success of this party is provoked by the 
economic difficulties caused by the transition, and do you see 
any danger in this apparent rise of the socialists? 
  [Goncz] No result can be prejudged, and in my capacity as 
head of state, I am bound over to bow to the opinions of the 
electorate. However, regardless of whichever party or coalition 
comes to power, it is certain that the priorities regarding 
foreign policy will not change. For from this point of view 
there is a complete consensus at national level. The economic 
priorities will remain the same, for if we are really seeking to 
join the international community, we cannot do an about-turn. 
So it is up to the electorate to decide how we might succeed in 
meeting these priorities, which will remain unaltered.

  [Excerpts] Knin, 24 Mar (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic, president 
of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], today sent a letter to 
Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy for the Russian president, in 
which he highlighted the issue of the Medak pocket. 
  Martic warned that six months after the withdrawal of 
Croatian forces, the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] was still 
in control of the area around the villages of Citluk, Divoselo, 
and Pocitelj, prohibiting the local population from returning 
and banning access to the Krajina militia and authorities. 
[passage omitted] 
  "You have seen that this was one of the most difficult 
problems in the negotiations at your embassy in Zagreb, and that 
the planned cease-fire agreement was most probably not signed 
because of it," Martic underlined, adding that the reference 
point in this case should be the line of separation between the 
Serb and Croat ethnic communities established by the decision of 
the Geneva conference of 23 November 1991. 
  The RSK president believes that UNPROFOR should not be 
allowed to replace the Croatian Army in keeping territories 
under occupation -- as is the case with the Medak pocket. 
  "The Medak pocket must be returned to Krajina and excluded 
as 
an issue in the negotiations between the Serb and Croat sides," 
Martic said, concluding that, if not, it will not make sense to 
continue the talks in Zagreb next Tuesday.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 24 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime 
Minister Radoje Kontic expressed his concern in Belgrade 
Thursday over the decision of U.N. Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali to send Turkish troops within the UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] forces. 
  During his meeting with the new commander of the 32,500 
UNPROFOR troops in former Yugoslavia, French General Bernard de 
Lapresle, Kontic brought up the question of Butrus-Ghali's 
readiness to deploy troops from neighbouring Turkey, a former 
occupation force in Yugoslavia. 
  Kontic also underlined the good cooperation between the 
Yugoslav Government and UNPROFOR and said that Yugoslavia highly 
estimated UNPROFOR's role and its contribution to the prevention 
of further destructions, conflicts and suffering in the former 
federation, it is a statement of the Federal Information 
Ministry notes [sentence as received]. 
  Nevertheless Kontic also pointed to the errors made by some 
parts of UNPROFOR, particularly in the republic of Serb Krajina 
(RSK) which had also been mentioned by U.N. Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali in his latest report to the U.N. Security Council. 
  The RSK was declared a U.N. Protected Area in March 1992 
according to the plan of the special U.N. envoy for former 
Yugoslavia Cyrus Vance, following clashes between the local 
Serbs and the Croatian authorities set off by Croatia's forcible 
secession from the Yugoslav Federation in mid 1991. 
  Butrus-Ghali said that in Croatia and the RSK the 
conflicting 
sides are accusing UNPROFOR of partiality. He exemplified this 
by four Croatian incursions into the RSK when the peacekeepers 
were unable to protect the Serb civilian population. 
  Kontic emphasized that the Yugoslav Government urges the 
extension of the UNPROFOR mandate in accordance with the Vance 
plan until a political settlement is found for the U.N. 
Protected Areas. 
  During the talks he also stressed Yugoslavia's firm 
orientation towards a peaceful and political solution to the 
crisis in former Yugoslavia. 
  The meeting between Kontic and De Lapresle was attended by 
the new UNPROFOR Director for Civil Affairs, Brazilian Diplomat 
Sergio de Mello.

  [Text] Sofia, March 24 (TANJUG) -- Bulgarian papers on 
Thursday sharply criticize a U.N. Security Council decision to 
accept Turkish troops for the U.N. peacekeeping force in the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Fire is not put out by petrol, the paper 24 HOURS writes, 
recalling that the decision is a "dangerous precedent, because a 
biased party to this two-year war cannot be a peacemaker." 
  Under the headline "Turks Light Fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Via the United Nations," the paper calls on great powers to 
think it over as to what is hiding behind Ankara's longstanding 
and persistent insistence to enter Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  A new Turkish presence in the Balkans is beginning, the 
paper 
DUMA writes on Thursday. DUMA insists that the United Nations 
should be energetically warned that neighbouring countries to 
the former Yugoslavia should not interfere in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's conflict, especially Turkey, with a past 
heavily weighing down on it as regards the peoples of the former 
Yugoslavia. This message holds also for Germany, Austria and 
Italy, the paper writes. 
  The daily adds that "Turkish troops will establish peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina today. Tomorrow, possibly in our country 
too." 
  By sending Turkish troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina the United 
Nations has shown its true face, the commentator of the paper 
KONTINENT says. The world organization should safeguard world 
peace by political means. Military operations have prevailed 
instead, the Sofia paper sets out. 
  Turkey has unequivocally taken the side of the Bosnian 
Moslems in the two-year civil war in the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Among the Islamic countries, 
Turkey has set an example in the sending of financial aid and 
mojahedin to Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as large quantities of 
weaponry, in defiance of a U.N-imposed arms embargo on the 
entire territory of the former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Bucharest, Romania, Mar. 23 (A.A.) -- President 
Suleyman Demirel, on an official visit to Romania, said on 
Wednesday that Ankara and Bucharest should cooperate to boost 
ties and help secure peace and stability in the Balkans. 
  "I believe the conflicts in the Balkans, the Caucasus, and 
the Middle East call for more frequent contacts between Romania 
and Turkey, two large states in the region," Demirel said in an 
address broadcast live on state radio from the Cotroceni Palace, 
where he met with Romanian President Ion Iliescu. Iliescu said 
Turkey and Romania were key countries for stability in the 
Balkans. 
  Demirel's visit is the second by a Turkish head of state 
since 1989, the year the communist regime of Nicolae Ceausescu 
was toppled in a bloody revolution. 
  In addition to the conflict in ex-Yugoslavia, the two sides 
discussed their increasing trade ties since the demise of 
communism. Turkish firms are involved in 2,649 ventures in 
Romania, the fourth largest number of any country. Turkey ranks 
ninth among countries in overall foreign investment in Romania 
since the 1989 revolution, at about 32.3 million U.S. dollars. 
  Demirel's visit coincides with the opening of a 
Romanian-Turkish bank in Bucharest. He also is expected to 
visit the port of Constantsa on the Black Sea, home of most of 
Romania's ethnic Turkish minority.

<F P=106> ["Message of President Sali Berisha to the Albanian People </F>
on Occasion of the Triumph of Democracy in Albania" -- ATA 
headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, March 22 (ATA) -- The greeting that 
President Berisha addressed to all Albanians on occasion of the 
second anniversary of the triumph of democracy on March 22, 1992 
describes the 1992 elections as one of the greatest events in 
the history of the Albanian democracy which defined Albania's 
road for the future. 
  Paying homage to the martyrs for freedom in all the times 
and 
especially the latest martyrs, those of '90, President Berisha 
recalls the last winter of the dictatorship, the destructions 
and the numerous victims of that time. "March 22 makes us 
recall all these not for revenge but not to allow them to be 
repeated," the message says. President Berisha compared the 
extreme poverty and the suspended economy, the serious 
consequences of the isolation with the situation of Albania 
after two years under democracy, when Albanians could manage to 
have the most rapid economic growth and a stable and practically 
convertible currency through the profound reforms they are 
carrying out. The country in which for so many years the cults 
of Hoxha and Stalin prevailed has now one of the most 
progressive charter of the human rights and freedoms of the 
time. Albania has become an important factor for the peace and 
stability in the region. It defined its western character 
clearer than any other former communist country. 
  Pointing to the overcome of the consequences of the 50 year 
long isolation in the foreign policy of Albania, Mr. Berisha 
says that engagement of Albania has given quite another 
dimension to the Albanian question in general and to that of the 
human and national rights and freedoms of the Albanians in their 
territories in the former Yugoslavia. At present, the Kosova 
question is first of all international and not simply Serbian as 
the Belgrade dictator claims, President Berisha says. 
  Stressing the contribution of the aid and solidarity of the 
European Union and its member countries, of the U.S.A. and other 
friendly European and Islamic countries, to the achievements of 
Albania, Mr. Berisha expresses his conviction that the free 
Albanian individual has been the decisive factor in this 
direction. 
  Concerning the difficulties that the Albanian people are 
experiencing, Mr. Berisha said: "There are numerous Albanian 
families or individuals who are not employed, who are on 
assistance or on pension that are experiencing very great 
difficulties in the daily life. I would like to assure them 
that the government will make uninterrupted efforts to improve 
their lives, to increase chances for their employment and to 
give them a social and economic support." 
  Speaking about the Meksi government, Mr. Berisha pointed out 
that facing a destroyed country, the new Albanian institutions 
had to apply the economic reform, the law, to fight against 
corruption, thus scoring one of the greatest victories within a 
short period of time: the overthrow of the state-individual 
ratio in favour of the latter. 
  "But our successes although great and undeniable cannot be 
considered an economic miracle," Mr. Berisha said, adding that 
Albania is the poorest country of Europe. "Our road towards 
prosperity and development is not filled with flowers but with 
serious difficulties." President Berisha said that "still there 
is a miracle existing in Albania, this is the vigour of freedom. 
This vigour will carry Albania nearer to the developed world, 
will ever more unite the Albanians wherever they are and will 
link them with other freedom-loving peoples and allied 
countries. Therefore, today all together let us say thanks God, 
and let us honour even more each other's freedom," the message 
says in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris </F>
Silajdzic by Mario R. Dederichs; place and date not given: 
"Punishing the Instigators"] 
  [Text] [Dederichs] Will the agreement between the Croats 
and Bosnians finally bring peace for Bosnia? 
  [Silajdzic] It is a very important step to ending the 
conflict between two peoples that have coexisted in an exemplary 
manner for centuries. The war has destroyed a great deal of 
confidence, but in the end we will have to live together. 
  [Dederichs] Why was the agreement signed in Washington? 
  [Silajdzic] The United States has made a decisive 
contribution. I hope that it will continue its efforts because 
the Europeans are currying favor with the Serbs and rewarding 
aggression by recognizing conquests. 
  [Dederichs] Which Europeans? 
  [Silajdzic] The appeasement started in London and was 
completed in Moscow. The Germans were ready to help but were 
not always consistent. Germany has provided valuable assistance 
for our refugees. 
  [Dederichs] The European Union has demanded that the Bosnian 
Serbs should give up some of their territory. Is that not 
sufficient? 
  [Silajdzic] The principle of not recognizing occupied 
territories remains hollow if it is not implemented everywhere. 
  [Dederichs] The United Nations wants to prosecute the war 
criminals. 
  [Silajdzic] Culprits from all the ethnic groups must be 
punished, not only the criminals but the instigators, too, those 
who are responsible for "ethnic cleansing." 
  [Dederichs] Including the Serbian leaders Karadzic or 
Milosevic? 
  [Silajdzic] They must also be punished! We all must face up 
to the truth, otherwise 1994 will be like 1939. A total of 
16,000 children have been killed in the war in Bosnia. We know 
who is responsible.

  [Text] Sofia, March 23 (BTA) -- In connection with the 
forthcoming discussion of UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
increase in keeping with the UN Security Council Resolution 900, 
I would like to refer to the letter of President Zhelyu Zhelev 
to the UN secretary general and to the declaration of Bulgaria's 
Foreign Ministry of March 14, reads a statement of the spokesman 
for Bulgaria's Foreign Ministry. The letter and the declaration 
express the position of the Republic of Bulgaria that both the 
need for an increase of UN forces in this region and the 
prospects for future stability should be considered, reads the 
press release sent to BTA. 
  The Republic of Bulgaria consistently supports all 
constructive initiatives aimed at a swift and lasting settlement 
of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I would like to point 
out that in our opinion the non-participation of Balkan states 
in UNPROFOR is a stabilizing factor, promoting regional security 
and stability in the long run, the statement says.

  [Excerpts] Sofia, March 24 (BTA) -- The Confederation of 
Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) supports the demands 
of most national dailies for changes in the Value Added Tax Act 
which is to come into force on April 1, 1994. This was 
announced today by the Press Office of the KNSB -- one of the 
two major trade union amalgamations in this country. The 
leadership of the KNSB insists that parliament urgently revises 
the issue of levying VAT on the press and advertisements in it, 
with the exception of erotic and pornographic publications. 
"The achievements of democracy in Bulgaria are not so great as 
to allow for a restriction of the right of the public to be 
informed by financial mechanisms," the KNSB press release reads. 
[passage omitted] 
  A number of newspapers today did not cover the work of the 
Council of Ministers and the National Assembly. Some came out 
with blanks in protest against VAT on newspapers. The 
initiators of the protest have also approached the Bulgarian 
National Television and the Bulgarian National Radio with a 
appeal to support their demands. Their next step will be the 
stopping of newspapers and broadcasts on the private radio 
stations from March 28 through 31 inclusive. If by this date 
parliament does not exempt Bulgarian books, periodical press and 
advertisements in it, magazines and the electronic media from 
VAT, the group of 15 will discuss their next actions. The bill 
on amending the VAT Act has not been put on the agenda of the 
National Assembly yet. 
  The Parliamentary Budget and Finance Committee discussed and 
adopted a stand today on the proposed changes in the VAT Act. 
Members of the committee have proposed a compromise solution, 
according to which the newspapers and the mass media will not 
register for paying VAT till the end of this year. Instead they 
will pay the old 10 percent turnover tax, including on 
advertisements. The bill amending the VAT Act is expected to 
enter the plenary chamber next week. Next Thursday -- March 31, 
Sofia cinemas will show only erotic films in protest against 
VAT, the "Sofia Film" Company told BTA. A press conference was 
held at the Ministry of Finance today on the forthcoming 
introduction of VAT. 
  This afternoon 16 editors-in-chief of national dailies 
adopted a declaration demanding the resignation of Finance 
Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov because of his stand on the VAT Act. 
"The government should comprise only of people respecting 
freedom of speech, the democratic institutions and the 
Constitution", the declaration reads. 
  The editors-in-chief add that it is inadmissible for a 
person 
who rejects the most important democratic institution -- the 
free press, to be a member of this country's government.

  [Text] Sofia, March 24 (BTA) -- The National Assembly 
today passed on second reading a Special Surveillance Devices 
Act. It regulates the application of methods such as 
photography, filming, opening letters and others, without the 
knowledge of or against the will of persons under surveillance. 
This is a priority law whose passage has been repeatedly urged 
by the prime minister and the president. 
  Under the act, information acquired by special surveillance 
devices can be requested and used by the Interior Ministry, the 
National Investigative Service, the National Security Service, 
the National Investigative Service, the Border Troops, the 
Central Service for Organized Crime Control and the intelligence 
and the counterintelligence services with the Defence Ministry. 
  Special surveillance devices can be supplied, installed and 
used only by specialized services of the Interior Ministry. 
Their use has to be ordered and permitted by the interior 
minister. These devices may be used without such a permission 
only in case of imminent danger of a crime against national 
security, or if there is available data of preparations for a 
terrorist act. In such cases the respective body should be 
informed within 24 hours. 
  The act fixes a two-month term for the use of special 
surveillance devices, which can be extended by another four 
months. 
  Data collected by special surveillance devices can only be 
used for detecting or preventing a crime. The act charges the 
interior minister with the control on the application of these 
devices. 
  Vasil Mikhaylov, MP of the Union of Democratic Forces, 
suggested that the act provides guarantees that such devices 
will not be used in the absence of data of guilt, but the motion 
was rejected by a majority of mostly Socialist MP's. Mr. 
Mikhaylov also suggested that the act comes into force after 
texts are added to the Criminal Code providing for penalties for 
the misuse of special devices and information thus obtained, but 
this motion also failed to pass.

  [Text] Prague, March 23 (CTK) -- According to some 
Bratislava officials, Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) 
Chairman Milos Zeman has informed leaders of the Slovak Social 
Democrats and Democratic Left Party (SDL) of his intention to 
make a new endeavor to create the Czechoslovak union, Robert 
Casensky and Michal Musil from Bratislava say in the 
right-oriented daily TELEGRAF today. 
  According to Zeman's plan, a referendum should decide on the 
issue. Although the information has been confirmed by Frantisek 
Miklosko, chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) 
Deputies' Group, and indirectly by SDL Chairman Peter Weiss, 
Zeman asserts that he did not make such a statement. 
  "Should such an offer be made I will comment on it," Zeman 
said. However, if some Slovak political parties consider such a 
proposal then it is "their own business" and the CSSD would not 
interfere in it, Zeman said. 
  Miklosko asserts, however, that Zeman has actually come up 
with such an initiative at talks with representatives of the 
Slovak Social Democratic Party (SSDS) and part of the SDL. 
Miklosko said that according to information he possessed, the 
CSSD is planning to include the creation of the union in its 
election program. Slovak political parties had not, however, 
shown much interest in Zeman's initiative. "I personally believe 
that the Slovak left will not be strong enough to carry out the 
idea. Mr. Zeman has much bigger aspirations in this respect," 
Miklosko said. 
  Weiss did not refute Miklosko's information. Asked directly 
what his party's stand has on the proposal by the Czech Social 
Democrats, Weiss said that the SDL saw the division of 
Czechoslovakia as a fait accompli. "The independence of both the 
Czech and Slovak Republics is a reality and there is no point in 
changing it," Weiss said, adding that there were neither 
internal political nor external political conditions for the 
renewal of something which was once here.

  [Text] Prague, March 23 (CTK) -- Pavel Novak, deputy 
chairman of the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), told CTK 
he considered the information published in the right-oriented 
daily TELEGRAF today that CSSD Chairman Milos Zeman intended to 
renew the "Czechoslovak union", to be a misunderstanding. 
  TELEGRAF writes that Frantisek Miklosko, chairman of the 
deputies group of Slovakia's Christian Democratic Movement 
(KDH), said that "Zeman submitted such an initiative during his 
talks with the Slovak Social Democrats and part of (Slovakia's) 
Democratic Left Party (SDL)...and according to his (Miklosko's) 
information, the CSSD planned to include such an initiative into 
its election program." 
  Novak said he spoke to Zeman every day but they had never 
discussed such an initiative. He stressed that representatives 
of social democracy had never discussed "a similar project" 
either with Miklosko or SDL leaders, or leaders of the Social 
Democratic Party in Slovakia (SDSS). CSSD has not dealt with 
these questions since the split of the Czechoslovak Federation 
on January 1, 1993, Novak said. 
  He stressed that the activity of Zeman as deputy to the now 
defunct federal parliament in late 1992, by which he pushed for 
the unity of the country, had not represented CSSD policy. 
Zeman then had "only certain support" within the party, but not 
of its central boards.

  [Text] Prague, March 24 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec and Dutch Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans 
discussed primarily the situation in the European Union at their 
meeting today. Kooijmans is accompanying Queen Beatrix on a 
three-day official visit to the Czech Republic. The visit ends 
today. 
  The Dutch minister said it was impossible to speak of an 
exact date for the Czech Republic to become a full member of the 
EU when it hadn't even applied for membership yet. It is up to 
individual governments to decide when and under what conditions 
to apply, he said. Nevertheless, if the admission of Austria, 
Norway, Sweden and Finland is not postponed, he saw no reason 
for the Czech Republic not to be admitted around the year 2000, 
if it applies. 
  Zieleniec said he considered the present discussions in the 
EU important and dramatic, even if they're only about technical 
things like voting rules and blocking minorities. At heart, its 
vision of the future and entire philosophy are at stake, he said. 
  In conclusion, both ministers praised the state of good 
relations between the two countries.

  [Text] Prague, March 23 (CTK) -- It was a "gross insult" 
of Premier Vaclav Klaus to compare Tuesday's [22 March] trade 
union demonstration with the demonstration of February 1948, 
chairman of the Bohemian and Moravian Trade Union Chamber 
(CMKOS) Vladimir Petrus told journalists today. 
  Petrus said the demonstration of 25 February 1948, also in 
Prague's Old Town Square but in support of the communist coup, 
"was not done by the unions. The victorious Communist Party 
abused the unions." He said he promised Klaus that the "unions 
would not let themselves be abused again by any victorious party 
for a new February." 
  Petrus rejected Klaus's statement yesterday that the 
demonstration had been organized by "a partial group of people". 
The trade union leadership was not a partial group, he said. 
  He said the unions regretted the incidents surrounding 
Minister of Employment and Social Affairs Jindrich Vodicka's 
attendance (Vodicka was prevented from addressing the 
demonstrators). But Vodicka had not been invited was himself to 
blame. 
  The demonstration, attended by 40-50,000 people according to 
union estimates, was a watershed in the work of the unions, 
Petrus said. "We realized discussions alone were impossible 
because you can only talk with somebody who wants to listen," he 
said. Petrus did not comment on the unions' next moves, saying 
it was for the congress to decide. 
  Demonstration participants appealed to parliament to 
consider 
their demands concerning the making of repeated contracts, the 
position of pregnant women and mothers with small children, the 
increase in the pension age, the management of money set aside 
for pension insurance and the ban on trade union activity in the 
civil service.

  [Text] Prague, March 23 (CTK) -- The Chamber of Deputies 
today passed the government-proposed amendment to the Employment 
Law, with changes as made in the joint report of the 
parliamentary committees. Parliament did not approve any of the 
changes proposed by opposition deputies during yesterday's 
debate. 
  Deputies of the government coalition parties, the Liberal 
National Social Party (LSNS) and independent deputy Josef Jezek, 
a former deputy of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) voted for 
the government draft amendment. Opposition deputies did not 
support the amendment -- they either were not present or voted 
against it. 
  Deputies present from the Czech Social Democratic Party 
(CSSD), Liberal Social Union (LSU) and independent deputy 
Ladislav Rymes voted against the amendment. Members of the 
deputies' groups of the Left Bloc (LB), Communist Party of 
Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), Movement for Self-Governing 
Democracy-Society for Moravia and Silesia (HSD-SMS), 
Czech-Moravian Central Party (CMSS) and Assembly for the 
Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) abstained from 
voting. 
  Neither a proposal by Petra Buskova (CSSD) that a provision 
banning women's employment at night be excluded from the Labor 
Law nor changes reflecting trade unions' stand proposed by 
Deputy Hana Orgonikova from the LSU were approved by parliament. 
  According to the amended Labor Law, employment legislation 
will concern all types of employers equally -- be they physical 
or legal persons. Up to now terms and conditions of employment 
between an employee and an employer who is a legal person were 
set down by the labor law, those between an employee and an 
employer who is a physical person by government regulations. 
The amended law transfers the decision-making concerning 
overtime work from ministries to employment offices. 
  The amendment says that at places where no trade union is 
active, an employer can provide his employees advantages similar 
to that set down in a collective agreement (concluded between an 
employer and a trade union). 
  The new labor law makes provision for the future change in 
the system of accident insurance by abolishing of the existing 
compensation limits for the loss of income of persons who lose 
their work capability due to accidents at work or diseases 
ensuing from the nature of employment. The pensions these 
people receive will rise with the growth of the average salary.

  [Text] Prague March 24 (CTK) -- The problem of the Czech 
Republic's local government system is considered very urgent by 
nine percent of the population and urgent by 21 percent, 
according to a poll carried out by the Institute for Public 
Opinion Research (IVVM) between March 2 and 7 among 534 
inhabitants of Bohemia and 354 in Moravia. Thirty six percent 
thought it was not very urgent, while 21 percent saw no problem 
at all. 13 percent did not know. 
  Among inhabitants of Moravia and Silesia, the figure seeing 
the issue as very urgent or urgent rose to 37 percent, while in 
Bohemia it was 26 percent. When the results of previous polls 
are compared, fewer and fewer people are seeing the problem of 
local government as urgent. 
  In Bohemia, 24 percent want a system which includes a 
division on the level of the "lands" of Bohemia and 
Moravia-Silesia, while in Moravia 40 percent are for such a 
solution. 
  Meanwhile, sixty-nine percent of the republic's inhabitants 
think there are far more important tasks at present than that of 
local government arrangements. 20 percent do not agree with 
this statement, and 11 percent do not know. 
  Fifty-four percent said they still did not understand the 
problem, and 51 percent said they were not very interested. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  Another IVVM poll, conducted between January 7 and 13 also 
among 885 respondents, asked people's opinions on other aspects 
of local government, including taxation. 58 percent said that 
if higher local administrative units were created that people 
would pay more taxes, while 21 percent disagreed and a further 
21 percent did not know. 
  If the higher local administrative units were formed, 58 
percent thought that districts (the second tier in the present 
system) should be preserved, 26 percent thought they should not 
be, and 16 percent did not know. 
  According to 44 percent, the most important thing was that 
Moravia did not pay for Bohemia, 39 percent did not agree and 17 
did not know. 
  The opinion that the creation of higher local administrative 
units would help central government to function better was 
expressed by 42 percent. 30 percent did not agree with this, 
and 28 percent did not know. 
  Seventy-eight percent agreed with the statement that local 
government reform was only talked about and nothing was being 
done. 68 percent said they believed that politicians were not so 
much interested in the issue itself as in trying to reap 
political benefits from the problem. 63 percent said they 
believed politicians did not actually know which solution would 
be best. Thirty five percent said they thought the ODS [Civic 
Democratic Party] was holding up local government reform 
unnecessarily.

<F P=106> [Article by Marc Ballon: "Parents Find It's Not All in a </F>
Name"] 
  [Text] Julietta Clare Rimmer cannot exist. 
  She's very much alive. At the age of three weeks, she makes 
funny faces and coos at her parents. 
  But officially, she has no name, even though her parents 
have 
chosen one they think would suit her fine. 
  Under Czech law, formal first names must be approved by the 
state and middle names are forbidden. In addition, baby girls 
normally have the feminine suffix -ova (or in some 
cases -a) at the end of their surnames, regardless of 
parental wishes. 
  Officials at Prague 4 City Hall said the name "Julietta" 
could not be used because it doesn't appear in "What Should We 
Name Our Child," the Czech Government's list of acceptable 
names. Giulietta and Juliana are OK, though. Clare is not, 
because the communists outlawed middle names in 1949. And 
finally, Rimmer must become Rimmerova, even though the baby's 
father is British and wants his daughter to have his surname. 
  Unfair? Kafkaesque? Julietta Clare Rimmer's father thinks 
so. 
  "I can't believe how ridiculous this is," said Julian 
Rimmer, 
42, a restaurant owner and news editor at Radio Metropolis in 
Prague. "You should be able to do something as basic as choosing 
your child's name without the state's approval." 
  Julietta Clare Rimmer's mother, Iveta Placha, a 32-year-old 
lawyer and Rimmer's fiancee, agreed. "This is totally, 
completely crazy," she said. 
  It is Miloslava Knappova who has the final word on names in 
the Czech Republic. A noted linguist and author of the official 
Czech name book, which contains more than 1,550 Czech names and 
scores of foreign variations, she adjudicates name disputes. As 
a rule, proper names and their foreign equivalents are 
acceptable. Nicknames are forbidden. Alena, for example, is 
fine, but Alenka, Aja or Ala get a thumbs down. 
  "A couple recently wanted to call their child Rambo," said 
Knappova. "I had to turn it down. I couldn't find the name in 
any official name publication anywhere in the world." 
  Name guidelines make sense to Knappova. It is a matter of 
protecting children's rights--without the guidelines, she said, 
parents could cause their children emotional harm by naming them 
Asthma or Pneumonia, as an American couple recently did. 
  Most other European countries have similar restrictions. 
Austria, for example, has a list of officially recognized names, 
while Germany bans "insulting" and gender-neutral names such as 
Toni. 
  Many Czechs seem to accept the system. In her 25 years as 
the 
local name guru, Knappova has received an average of 100 appeals 
per year. If she can find a justification, she grants an appeal, 
which costs an average of 200-300 Kc ($6-10) for time and 
effort. She even goes so far as to consult with linguists at 
Prague's Charles University if a particularly exotic name comes 
along, she said. 
  So where does this leave Rimmer, Placha and their baby? They 
say their fight has only begun. 
  "One way or the other we'll get Julietta added to the book 
of 
names," Rimmer said, "even if it takes the British Embassy's 
intervention." 
  He has given up on keeping Clare and Rimmer, though. Some 
battles just cannot be won, he said, no matter how sound the 
argument. 
  The Czech Interior Ministry is expected to propose changing 
existing name laws later this year, but refuses to divulge any 
details.

<F P=106> [Article by Michele Kayal: "Central Europe Accelerates Free </F>
Trade"] 
  [Text] The economic leaders of the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Poland and Slovakia pledged early this month to speed up the 
liberalization of trade among their countries and create a free 
trade zone in less than five years. 
  A fast-track version of the Central European Free Trade 
Agreement (CEFTA) agreed upon in Prague on Feb. 4, commits the 
four countries to achieving free trade by Jan. 1, 1998--three 
years faster than previously planned. 
  By that date, tariff and non-tariff barriers for 
manufactured 
goods are to be lowered or abolished. In just two months, the 
CEFTA nations are scheduled to decide upon an expanded list of 
goods that will enjoy completely free trade under the fast-track 
program. 
  Certain sensitive areas--including agriculture, textiles, 
metals and automobiles--are not addressed in the current plan. 
Expert panels are scheduled to begin immediate discussions on 
how to resolve these issues. 
  Agriculture is expected to present the biggest obstacle. The 
four countries' trade ministers said they would like to expand 
the current list of items slated for completely free trade. 
  Czech Minister of Trade and Industry Vladimir Dlouhy said 
that the group's determination to quickly solve complex 
agricultural disagreements signals that the countries are "ready 
to start eating this bitter apple." 
  Keeping in step with the Western nations that recently 
concluded trade pacts such as the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), the CEFTA countries said they expect the union to 
improve their economies and to help ease their integration into 
Europe. Each member country is permitted to sign bilateral 
agreements with third countries--Romania and Bulgaria are 
primary candidates. 
  CEFTA was signed in December 1992 by the Czech and Slovak 
republics, Hungary and Poland with the goal of creating a free 
trade zone for the region's 65 million people by the year 2001. 
  The agreement began taking effect in March 1993 with the 
gradual removal of tariffs from 60 percent of listed items 
traded between Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, and 54 
percent of industrial goods from Slovakia. 
  Ironically, trade among the CEFTA countries has shriveled 
since the agreement was initially signed. Hungary's trade with 
CEFTA countries, for instance, shrank from 12.5 percent of total 
trade to just 5 percent. 
  All four countries negotiating CEFTA are also pressing for 
freer trade with Western Europe, where the threat of 
anti-dumping proceedings has caused problems in the past. 
  "The European Union is the main market for us," said 
Miroslav 
Somol, a deputy minister at the Czech Ministry of Trade and 
Industry. 
  Somol said the republic is particularly anxious to see 
changes in the quotas that the Western Europeans have 
implemented against Czech steel and textiles.

"Labor Pact Falls From Favor Before Ink Is Dry"] 
  [Text] Before the ink has even dried, the government, 
unions and employers--the three parties that signed the 1994 
general agreement on labor practices--are dismissing the 
document as a bureaucratic waste of time that will fail to 
achieve its lofty aims of social good will and peace. 
  Union officials who signed the agreement last month say they 
have little faith in its idealistic tenets and can no longer 
trust a government that continues to deceive them. 
  "The social tension is going to grow, and we won't be able 
to 
stop the strikes. That's what we're warning the government," 
said Jifi Tejkal, vice president of the Czech-Moravian Chamber 
of Trade Unions, which represents 3.5 million workers at 40 
unions throughout the country. 
  Meanwhile, business representatives say the deal fails to 
address the issues of most importance: wages and productivity. 
  The general agreement "means nothing," said Jaroslav Hosek, 
personnel and administration manager at the Prague-based heating 
supply company Prazska Teplarenska. He said the negotiators 
"wasted their time." 
  And the government, which acted as the honest broker during 
the negotiations leading up to the agreement, would prefer to 
walk away from any lingering disputes. 
  "If they have some objections about something they signed, 
it's their bloody problem," said Otakar Veverka, spokesman for 
the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. 
  The general agreement, which was first drawn up in 1991 and 
has been amended every year since, aims to preserve social peace 
in the period of transition from a state-controlled economy to a 
market system. 
  The agreement specifies obligations regarding collective 
bargaining, employment, wages, and social and legal security. 
The conditions are binding on all levels. 
  Representatives from unions, the Ministries of Finance, 
Labor 
and Economy and the Union of Employers, a 55-member organization 
that represents the management interests of the country's 
largest employers, all take an active role in forming a new 
agreement each year. 
  After two months of negotiations, consensus on this year's 
agreement was finally reached and the deal was signed Jan. 21. 
But labor, which had talked about rejecting the agreement for a 
month, supported it by the narrowest possible margin: 16 to 14. 
  Tejkal voted against the agreement after deciding there was 
nothing concrete backing it up. "The general agreement is less 
binding now than it was in 1992 or 1993," he said. 
  Labor does appear to be losing ground. Last year the 
agreement promised a "real increase in nominal wages...in 
comparison with the same period last year." But in this year's 
agreement, the clause simply says that management and labor will 
find a mutually acceptable wage-settlement without "unreasonable 
pressures on wages." 
  Worse still, Tejkal believes the government bargains in bad 
faith. After agreeing to wage increases last year, the 
government overruled the general agreement by passing separate 
wage-control legislation, he said. 
  "If we cannot force [the government] to follow these 
articles, we cannot force them to do anything," he said. 
  In addition, the government is considering legislation that 
will ban civil servants from organizing unions and restructuring 
pension laws to drastically reduce benefits. 
  "I'm very critical of what's happening to our rights," he 
said. "It's a very sad thing to realize we are fighting the same 
battles that our grandfathers fought 100 years ago." 
  Jan Uhlif, president of Kovo, the 800,000-member metal 
workers' federation--who voted for the agreement--conceded that 
he also has qualms about it. 
  "We don't trust the government too much. But we admit it is 
also bad to close the door. It's best to push the partners to be 
more serious," he said, adding that he's "not the type to stand 
on the barricades." 
  Business representatives appear to be less concerned. 
  Hosek said he isn't considering the general agreement during 
ongoing collective bargaining with the two unions that represent 
Prazska Teplarenska's 2,200 employees. The unions are pushing 
for a shorter work-week and a 25-percent wage increase. 
  "It's unacceptable to our company because we're regulated by 
the state," Hosek said, referring to last year's wage-control 
legislation. "If there was only the collective agreement, I 
wouldn't be against it. I don't like the goals of the general 
agreement. It's like central planning by the state." 
  Milan Smutny, a spokesman for automaker Skoda, supports the 
general agreement's social aims but adds that, in the future, 
more emphasis should be placed on productivity. 
  "If you see [the 1993 statistics for Czech industry], 
salaries went up but productivity went down," he said. Many 
companies continue to give unions everything they want, he said. 
"It is economic nonsense leading to loans for salaries and 
wages." 
  Officials within the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs 
respond that management and labor's complaints regarding the 
agreement amount simply to political posturing. 
  The government had no choice but to impose wage controls 
last 
year because wages were simply rising too quickly, said Pavel 
Michal, head of the ministry's collective-bargaining services. 
  Ministry spokesman Veverka said, "The government had to 
allow 
itself an avenue out in case wages continued to rise this year." 
  Michal and Veverka scoffed at labor's claims that the 
government had acted in bad faith. The government would always 
be a strong social partner interested in keeping the peace, 
Michal said. But both officials said that the government's role 
in negotiations may change drastically soon. 
  "In the future, [the general agreement] should be a creation 
of social partners alone. It doesn't mean, of course, that the 
government won't be listening," Michal said. 
  Michal added that some unionists are complaining about 
change 
because they miss the luxuries they enjoyed under communism. "Of 
course, they want to have it back. The person who wants a return 
to the old system--I feel sorry for him." 
  George Kopejtko, head of the ministry's territorial section, 
added, "We can only hope there won't be too many [unions] 
around"--a comment that could help explain some of labor's fears 
about the conservative Klaus government.

  [Text] Budapest, March 24 (MTI) -- The insinuation heard 
recently on Hungarian Television that the Hungarian Socialist 
Party (MSZP) would take over the media if it came to power after 
May"s parliamentary elections, is utterly ridiculous, MSZP 
cultural executive Gabor Kis Gellert said at the party"s press 
conference on Thursday. 
  He said his party would appoint new heads to Hungarian Radio 
and Television, and would remedy legal offences like the recent 
dismissal of 129 Hungarian Radio staff. 
  Gellert said television news programmes hardly ever carry 
reports about the MSZP. According to their survey, from March 
16 to 22, Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] politicians appeared 
on 30 occasions, not counting parliamentary coverage. 
  In this same period, one single report was carried about the 
MSZP, and that was about the jogging accident of MP Laszlo 
Bekesi, the Socialist's economic expert.

  [Text] Warsaw, 24 March (MTI) -- "Nothing is so good that 
it cannot be improved," Polish President Lech Walesa told MTI's 
Warsaw correspondent on Polish-Hungarian links, prior to 
President Arpad Goncz's visit to Poland starting March 28. 
Walesa said he expected the visit to encourage the two 
countries' governments, ministers, and businessmen to boost 
cooperation. 
  The Visegrad cooperation, involving the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, forms an integral part of 
Poland's policy of open borders, Walesa said. Regional 
cooperation has a logical, practical gain. "We are doomed to 
cooperate, so -- whatever its name will be in the future -- the 
group will improve almost automatically. The future will prove 
it viable," he said. 
  "Irrespective of what the current Czech leadership thinks, 
Prague and Budapest will always be closer to Warsaw than New 
York," he added. 
  On military cooperation, Walesa said, "We cannot set up a 
separate organization because it would be disapproved by both 
the West and the Russians, and we would get too many enemies. 
The given situation is dangerous, though. 
  "I believe we have to be capable of defending the 
independence and freedom of both Poland and Hungary. 
  "We should state that, for example, if Hungary was 
threatened, Poland would have to defend it. 
  "There is no need for a pact or a bloc: the issue would be a 
solidarity-inspired protection of common values," Walesa 
stressed. 
  Walesa said it was no wonder that the Russians were trying 
to 
win themselves the most advantageous position and take the lead 
of the region. This is not their fault, but that of NATO, which 
left a vacuum here. He also criticized the West for pursuing a 
short-sighted policy and for having misled, in a sense, the 
region's countries. 
  "Russia's attitude can be understood, but the Western 
conduct 
not, all the less as the age of confrontation is over. We could 
have been gradually integrated during a longer period of time, 
which would have been a paying deal for the West, rather than a 
losing one" Walesa said.

  [Text] Washington, March 24 -- "Our talks in Washington 
indicate that there is a chance to persuade the U.S. Congress to 
grant financial assistance to Poland for armed forces 
modernization, Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk told Polish 
reporters here on Thursday. 
  Secretary of State at the Defence Ministry Jerzy Milewski, 
who is accompanying the defence minister in his American visit, 
explained that only assistance within the framework of bilateral 
cooperation is concerned because one cannot count on the 
American side to grant money to cover Polish part of costs 
involved in the implementation of the "Partnership for Peace" 
programme. 
  Kolodziejczyk added that NATO intends to assign between 15 
and 40 million dollars for the whole "Partnership for Peace" 
programme and costs Poland would have to bear are estimated at 
25 million dollars. 
  Jerzy Milewski said that the Polish delegation tried to 
persuade the senators with whom it met that means for assistance 
to Poland should be assigned from the U.S. budget. This matter 
was supported by Senator Hank Brown, who promised to put forward 
a motion to the effect. 
  Minister Kolodziejczyk said that the modernization of the 
Polish Army is the condition of top priority for the development 
of military cooperation between Poland and the United States. 
  Although the present policy pursued by the Pentagon does not 
envisage the sale of arms to countries of eastern and central 
Europe, minister Kolodziejczyk said that he was striving also 
for this. "We have to gain a supplier alternative to the 
previous eastern one because such are the attributes of a 
sovereign state," the minister added. 
  He also revealed that joint Polish-American manoeuvres would 
be held in Poland this year. He explained that he settled this 
issues during the Wednesday meeting with Chairman of the U.S. 
Joint Chiefs of Staffs John Shalikashvili, who is to monitor the 
exercises. 
  On Thursday, Kolodziejczyk met with director of the Central 
Intelligence Agency James Woolsey with whom he discussed 
cooperation in the field of military intelligence. 
  On Friday Kolodziejczyk is to sign a Polish-American 
agreement on military cooperation.

President's decision to lift the restrictions on arms sales to 
Romania and other states in the region", reads a release

being an important step both in the development of the 
Romanian-American cooperation in the military domain, and in the 
dynamics of the relations between Romania and the NATO, within 
the Partnership for Peace. 
  "The Foreign Ministry considers this decision made by the 
U.S. President to be a practical confirmation of the American 
stand according to which Romania's security is important for the 
United States security, being a matter of direct and material 
interest to the U.S. and the NATO", the release concludes.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 23/3/1994 -- The Romanian 
Government dismissed on 18 March, 15 mayors and 12 councillors. 
Nicolae Vrabiescu, mayor of the Bucharest District Six, is top 
of the list. He was elected to this position in February 1992 
on the ticket of the Democratic Convention (CDR), the main 
opposition coalition. Vrabiescu is member of the 
Christian-Democratic National Peasant Party (PNTCD), the main 
party of the CDR. 
  Grave infringements of the laws by authorizing construction 
on land in public property, no due attention granted to payments 
of sums resulting from leasing or hiring, that are part of the 
local budget, were among the reasons given by the government for 
Vrabiescu's demise. 
  The dismissal of the mayor of the Bucharest District Six has 
been met with a strong reaction by Mr. Vrabiescu's party, which 
calls it "illegal and abusive." The spokesman for the PNTCD 
told a press conference of this party that the move was part of 
a campaign "of denigration of the PNTCD, that has turned tougher 
and tougher" and is likely to be a sign that "the ruling Party 
of Social Democracy abandons the idea that snap elections would 
not be opportune." 
  As for Mr. Vrabiescu, he said that the accusations against 
him were ungrounded. "I shall ask to be handed the dismissal 
decision and then I shall take legal action," said he. 
  ADEVARUL writes in its March 21 issue that many residents of 
the Bucharest District Six are supposed to learn only now that 
"Vrabiescu was a representative of the Democratic Convention, as 
he made a name for himself not as a politician but as an abusive 
mayor, who illegally leased plots of land and commercial space 
in a district whose absolute master he thought he was." 
  Bucharest, Romania's capital counts six districts, each of 
them with its own town hall. The city also has a general 
mayoralty.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 24/3/1994 -- Significant changes 
in the electorate's options are currently taking place in 
Romania, according to an opinion poll carried out by the 
Romanian Public Opinion Polling Institute [IRSOP], requested by 
the Romanian Foundation for Democracy, whose results are 
published exclusively by daily TINERETUL LIBER. 
  If presidential elections were to take place in Romania and 
the candidates to run for the presidency would be the same as in 
the 1992 election campaign, 37 percent would be likely to opt 
for Emil Constantinescu [1992 candidate of the opposition 
electoral alliance], 27 percent for [current Romanian President] 
Ion Iliescu, and 10 percent for Gheorghe Funar (National 
Romanian Unity Party -- PUNR.) Worth mentioning is that 20 
percent of those polled said that they would abstain from vote. 
  As for a potential call of parliamentary elections, 30 
percent of the electorate would favor the Democratic Convention 
of Romania (CDR -- opposition,) while 23 percent would vote for 
the ruling party, the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. 
  Some 35 percent of the polled people view that a government 
formed by the opposition would be much successful in getting the 
country out of the crisis, 31 percent consider that the crisis 
could be overcome by a coalition government formed by the 
current ruling party together with the CDR opposition group and 
the Democratic Party-National Salvation Front [PD-FSN], while 20 
percent are of the opinion that much suited would be a coalition 
government consisting of the PDSR with the PUNR, the Socialist 
Party of Labor [PSM], and the Greater Romania Party [PRM], which 
currently are the main government backers. Worth mentioning is 
that 14 percent of the polled people are of the opinion that a 
PDSR government would be most suited to get the country out of 
the crisis. 
  Among the politicians in the current parliamentary majority, 
in the event that Ion Iliescu would not run for the presidential 
elections, 39 percent of the electorate are likely to opt for 
Adrian Nastase, the current speaker of the Chamber of Deputies 
and executive chairman of the PDSR, 21 percent for Gheorghe 
Funar, current chairman of the PUNR, and 10 percent are favoring 
Corneliu Vadim Tudor, the current chairman of the PRM. 
  The poll was carried out over 1-7 March 1994 on 1,100 
individuals in 65 localities in the rural areas and in Romanian 
towns.

  [Text] Vienna March 25 (CTK) -- In its relations with 
Hungary, above all, the Slovak Government wants to introduce "a 
new constructive tone and an objective dialogue free of 
emotion," new Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan said in an 
interview for the Austrian news agency, APA. 
  While he would ensure that continuity was maintained in 
Slovak foreign policy, the existing problems should be solved 
fairly quickly, said Kukan, former Czechoslovak and later Slovak 
ambassador to the U.N. 
  The government of Premier Jozef Moravcik intended to meet 
the 
conditions set by the Council of Europe (CE) concerning national 
minorities, he said. He himself wanted to press for bilingual 
road signs in the south of Slovakia where 600,000 Hungarians 
live, but said the decision would ultimately be parliament's. 
(Slovak-Hungarian road signs were banned by the Meciar 
government.) 
  Kukan also attached great importance to relations with 
Austria, adding that the only thing he was "not very optimistic" 
about was the problems concerning Slovak nuclear power stations. 
Asked if Austria's attempts to prevent the financing of the 
Mochovce nuclear power station by the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) could worsen relations 
between the two countries, Kukan said he thought the 
consequences would be "not at all good." 
  Slovakia had not yet managed to persuade the Austrians that 
Mochovce would not represent a threat to the environment, he 
said. "We have no choice but to hold further scientific talks," 
he added. With regard to Austrian offers to provide 
supplementary electricity instead, the foreign minister said 
that he did not have detailed information yet, but nonetheless 
"these things should be seriously looked into one more time." 
  Kukan said he knew of no specific date for the integration 
of 
Slovakia into the European Union (EU), but could imagine it 
happening "within several years." He said the change of Slovak 
Government had shown that Slovakia was a democratic country, 
because it had all happened without problems. The Visegrad 
countries (Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary) 
would enter the EU separately, Visegrad being only "a very free 
union," the foreign minister said at the end of the interview.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 23 (CTK) -- The Slovak Foreign 
Ministry strongly protests against Hungarian pressure on the 
international public designed to discredit the contribution of 
the Gabcikovo dam to traffic on the Danube, a ministry's 
statement published today says. 
  The statement responds to Tuesday's [22 March] statement by 
the Hungarian Government, saying the Slovak Government bears 
responsibility for the blockage of the Danube at the 
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydro-electric power station for 
unilaterally redirecting part of the Danube along a derivation 
canal on Slovak territory in November 1992. 
  The Hungarian Government called upon countries supporting 
free passage on the Danube to urge Slovakia to "stop its illegal 
activities and revive without delay the conditions for traffic." 
  Ship transport was interrupted due to accidents at the 
Gabcikovo dam in southern Slovakia on March 21. 
  The Slovak statement says there are no international 
dimensions of the danger to the power station. By contrast, the 
one-year operation of at Gabcikovo confirmed that conditions for 
accelerated ship transport along a 42-kilometers route had 
improved. 
  The Foreign Ministry says that Slovak authorities would take 
all necessary steps in order to revive international traffic.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 22 (CTK) -- The investigation 
underway into the shipping accidents that have blocked two locks 
at the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric power project on the 
Danube has so far not revealed any evidence of external 
interference, according to a Slovak Government statement which 
CTK has obtained. 
  "Only the findings of the government commission working at 
the Gabcikovo water project will be authoritative," the 
government statement reads. 
  Economics Minister Peter Magvasi refused to speculate about 
the possibility that the accidents were caused by sabotage, 
saying the commission had to continue and complete their 
investigation. 
  The Slovak Government expressed regret today at its session 
that international passage on the Danube remained impossible 
because the right-hand lock at Gabcikovo was still blocked by 
the Ukrainian tugboat Zernograd which sank on February 11. The 
government announced it hoped river traffic could be resumed 
within a few days. 
  A section of the bottom gate of the left lock was damaged -- 
it is not known how -- on Sunday [20 March] night and the 
resultant wave under the dam damaged mechanisms on the bottom 
gate of the right lock. Subsequently international ship 
transport along this section of the Danube has been interrupted. 
  The Hungarian Foreign Ministry earlier issued a statement 
asserting that the Slovak Government bore full responsibility 
for the blockage and asked countries supporting free passage on 
the Danube to call on Slovakia to re-open the river.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 24 (CTK) -- Premier Jozef 
Moravcik told Slovak Radio today he rejected the idea of the 
Czech-Slovak union and called it a wasted opportunity a year 
ago. He added that he still believed that since the new state 
emerged it had been out of place to develop the idea of a joint 
entity, he added. 
  The idea was presented by Chairman of the Czech Social 
Democratic Party Milos Zeman at a seminar organized by the 
Slovak Social Democratic Party last year, Moravcik reported. He 
dismissed the rumors that he met Zeman during his Monday's [21 
March] visit to Prague. 
  "I think that the European Union is our future," said 
Moravcik, adding that closer co-existence of the two countries 
will be possible within a wider framework. 
  "None of the Slovak and Czech political parties represented 
in the government are really contemplating the union," stressed 
Moravcik. "These are reminiscences, revived from time to time, 
but without any real substance," he added. 
  Zeman allegedly reiterated the issue during his recent 
meeting with a "part" of the Slovak Democratic Left Party (SDL). 
SDL chairman Peter Weiss did not deny the offer was tendered, 
but stated that the SDL was respecting the situation emerged 
after the split of the common state.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 23 (CTK) -- Vice-Governor of the 
Slovak National Bank Marian Tkac denied accusations of 
incompetence and collaboration with the former Czechoslovak 
communist secret police, the StB, at a press conference today. 
  The accusations were cited as reasons for his dismissal, 
which parliament voted for today. The final decision on the 
matter belongs, however, to President Michal Kovac. 
  "If my name does figure in StB documents I believe the 
courts 
will show it was added later," he said. 
  Accusations of professional incompetence arise from the 
"Indian bank" affair in which Tkac signed a fake bill of 
exchange depriving the Slovak treasury of $4.2 million. In his 
defense Tkac stated that after his mistake he immediately took 
steps which assured Slovakia lost "not a cent." 
  Tkac also resolutely denied involvement in the forgery of 
1,000 crown Slovak-stamped Czechoslovak banknotes which led to 
their sudden removal from circulation last autumn. 
  The coalition is said to have rejected him because he had 
been "at least for a while in every party." Tkac denied this, 
saying he was only ever a member of the Communist Party -- 
before quitting it a month after the revolution in December 1989. 
  "The Slovaks are an envious and mean-spirited nation and 
disparage...the work of people willing to do something for 
them," he declared. He said until the president's decision he 
would still feel vice-governor and wanted to continue to serve 
and aid Slovakia to prosperity.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 24 (CTK) -- The followers of 
former Premier Vladimir Meciar and the Slovak National Party 
(SNS) protested today against the "purges" carried out by the 
new government of Jozef Moravcik. 
  The demands referred to today's dismissal of chairman of the 
Supreme Inspection Office (NKU) Marian Vanko and NKU two vice 
chairmen. 
  The demonstrators, numbering some 2,000 to 5,000 people, 
shouted slogans like "Long live Meciar's government," "Shame on 
traitors" and "Dismiss President Kovac," thus showing belief 
that dismissed Meciar would return to power after the 
autumn-scheduled elections. 
  "We shall never recognize a government united only by hatred 
for Meciar's cabinet and a desire for power," SNS Deputy 
Chairman Eva Slavkovska told the crowd. "We must redress this 
wrong as the nation gains strength only by fighting for truth," 
she added. 
  Meciar did not attend the rally because the organizers were 
not able to guarantee his personal security, HZDS (Meciar's 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) Deputy Chairman Sergej 
Kozlik said. 
  After the rally some 500 people moved to parliament 
building, 
shouting anti-government and anti-president slogans. 
  "What we have not done in two years in power, this cabinet 
will certainly achieve," Ivan Luptak, an HZDS deputy, told CTK 
on the "purges" of the new coalition in the state institutions. 
"Within a few days in power they have been able to remove 
several official with top expertise. Now it is the turn for the 
directors of the district offices. They are subjected to strong 
pressure to tender their resignations," he said, adding that 
Meciar had left the opposition Christian Democrats in their 
posts. 
  According to Luptak, when dismissing the NKU officials, the 
government was evidently motivated by political grounds: "Can 
you imagine they would admit that the NKU director would uncover 
their dealings during the government session?"

  [Text] Bratislava, March 24 (CTK) -- The chairman of the 
Democratic Left Party (SDL), Peter Weiss, signed an agreement on 
cooperation in the November local elections with two minor 
left-wing parties today. 
  The coalition for the local elections is a first step for an 
agreement on cooperation in the general elections, Weiss told 
journalists. The coalition should offer citizens a "clear 
political alternative" and will receive support from partner 
parties in Western Europe, Weiss said. 
  The parties of the left coalition are the Social Democratic 
Party in Slovakia (SDSS), headed by Jaroslav Volf, and the 
Agricultural Movement (HZ), led by Jozef Klein. 
  The SDL has offered coalition membership also to the newly 
founded Slovak Entrepreneurs Association (ZPS), which however 
has decided to enter the elections independently. Polls show 
the ZPS to be Slovakia's fourth strongest party. With 4.8 
percent support among voters it would represent a significant 
boost to SDL popularity, currently rated at 11 percent.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 24 (CTK) -- Parliament today 
dismissed by secret ballot the chairman of the Supreme 
Inspection Office (NKU), Marian Vanko, and its two vice 
chairmen, Petr Sokol and Marian Vrabec. 
  All three were associated with the former government of 
Vladimir Meciar, which fell in a no confidence vote earlier this 
month. Despite protests from the erstwhile opposition, which is 
today's government, Vanko was named to the top NKU post as a 
deputy of Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). 
  The vote was preceded by a stormy debate full of accusations 
that the NKU was misused under Meciar's government for political 
purposes and was "indirectly" run by the government office, 
headed by Meciar colleague Ivan Lexa. Others accused the new 
government of intending to do basically the same thing. 
  During the evening, members of the HZDS and its former 
coalition partner, the Slovak National Party (SNS), demonstrated 
in front of the parliament building.

<F P=106> [Article by Lubomir Sedlak: "Outlook Bleak for Slovak </F>
Economy"] 
  [Text] The decline of the Slovak economy is likely to 
continue in 1994, according to a new study by Slovak experts. 
  A major report published by the quasi-official Prognostic 
Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences presents a gloomy 
view of rising unemployment, falling productivity and continuing 
high inflation in Slovakia. 
  But many Czech economists who have reviewed the report say 
that it may even be a bit optimistic. 
  The report, written by economists Pavol Karasz, Juraj 
Rencko, 
Iveta Pauhofova and Edita Bauerova, contains some hard-hitting 
predictions, many of which run counter to the Slovak 
government's official position. 
  Among the report's predictions: 
  Falling productivity. The gross domestic product 
in 1994 is projected to be between 0.8 and 3.3 percent lower 
than it was in 1993. 
  The report predicts that the 1994 GDP will total 166.4 
billion-170.6 billion Sk ($4.8 billion-4.9 billion). That would 
be the fourth annual decline since the 1989 revolution, though 
the rate of decline seems to be slowing. 
  Using constant values, the GDP totaled 172 billion Sk in 
1993, 180 billion Sk in 1992, 194 billion Sk in 1991 and 227 
billion Sk in 1990. The report does forecast a dim light at the 
end of the tunnel: zero GDP growth in 1995, which would be an 
improvement over the continual decline. 
  But Anton Marcincin of Prague's Center for Economic Research 
and Graduate Education (CERGE) said the institute's projections 
are too optimistic, adding that Slovak GDP could easily fall by 
as much as 6 percent in 1994. 
  Rising unemployment. The report projects that 
unemployment, which hovered around 12.9 percent in 1993, will 
jump to 15.6-17.3 percent this year, and could possibly climb as 
high as 20 percent. Between 390,000 and 433,000 people could be 
out of work by year's end. 
  Marcincin, however, predicts that unemployment will reach 
20-25 percent. 
  Deficit spending. The Slovak government projects 
that it will run a deficit of around 14 billion Sk, equaling 3.7 
to 3.9 percent of the expected GDP. But the Prognostic Institute 
report predicts that the deficit will reach 4.2-5.4 percent of 
the projected GDP. Nevertheless, that's still better than last 
year's rate of 6.2 percent. 
  Rising inflation. The report predicts that 
inflation will be 14 to 16 percent in 1994, even though real 
income will either continue to fall or, at best, remain flat. 
  But Jiri Schwarz, president of the Liberal Institute, a 
Prague-based think tank, warns that the inflation rate and 
budget deficit could both go much higher if Slovakia has early 
elections this year, as politicians spend more money on public 
works in order to trim the growing unemployment rate. 
  CERGE economist Marcincin predicts that inflation could 
reach 
22 percent. 
  Growing poverty. The report indicates that many 
young families, especially those with several children, a single 
parent, unemployed parents or parents who work in a 
recession-hit sector of the economy, have joined the group that 
lives at or below the poverty line, previously made up 
predominantly of pensioners. 
  The "social patience" of Slovakia's man in the street is 
gradually running out, the report warns. 
  The report concludes that no fundamental turnaround in the 
Slovak economy should be expected this year. And even if the GDP 
flattens out next year, it remains to be seen whether it will 
then be replaced by growth or simply by long-term stagnation. 
That depends to a large extent on just how able Slovakia is to 
change the structure of its economy. 
  Czech economist Zdislav Sulc, an adviser to the first 
post-1989 Czechoslovak government, said the Slovak economy in 
general is too "spontaneous," since the government still has not 
formulated a clear, well-defined economic policy for the 
country. Sulc also says the privatization process has come to a 
virtual halt in Slovakia.

  [Text] Tirana, March 24 (ATA) -- "We appeal to the United 
Nations, the United States, the European Union and Russia to 
include Kosova completely in the peaceful process, because 
without the resolution of the Kosova question, there will be no 
peace in the Balkans," Mr. Bujar Bukoshi, premier of the 
republic of Kosova, said at the press conference in the UN 
headquarters in New York, on March 22. 
  Dr. Bukoshi, who started a three day visit to the United 
States, called on world authorities once more not to ignore the 
explosive situation in Kosova, but to undertake preventive 
measures before it will be late. 
  "We demand an international presence in Kosova which will 
help prevent Serbian abuses, which may lead to a large conflict 
with destructive consequences for the peace in the region", Mr. 
Bukoshi said. He reiterated that sanctions towards Serbia 
should be conditioned with the correct resolution of the Kosova 
question. Mr. Bukoshi said that the peaceful policy of the 
Kosova leadership may loose its credibility among the Albanian 
people on both sides, and this peaceful approach may be 
considered by Belgrade as a challenge to the increasing 
repression. 
  Mr. Bukoshi said that this stand of the Albanians may be 
considered by the international community as a reason to ignore 
the situation in Kosova. 
  "Kosova fulfills all premises to be an independent state 
like 
other republics of former Yugoslavia. It is the richest region 
and with sufficient human potential. We are not demanding 
unification with Albania and this is the greatest compromise we 
are as a people. [sentence as received] We do not demand a 
violent change of the borders," Mr. Bukoshi said in a response 
to a question "Is Kosova able to be an independent state and 
will it demand a unification with Albania?"

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Ministry State Secretary Janos </F>
Martonyi by Gabor Szego; place and date not given: "European 
Union: At the Same Time, But Not Together"] 
  [Text] On the basis of the Hungarian Government's decision 
and parliament's approval, Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky will 
present the Hungarian Republic's official application for 
membership of the European Union [EU] to Theodhoros Pangalos, 
current chairman of the EU Council, in Athens on 1 April. 
  As was announced by Janos Martonyi in Warsaw on 22 March, 
the 
request will be submitted in coordination with Poland. 
NEPSZABADSAG interviewed Martonyi on the background of this 
decision, among other things. 
  [Szego] In the past the Hungarian wish has been expressed 
many times, namely that Brussels should not treat the East 
Central European states requesting EU membership as a bloc or a 
group; rather, their readiness for membership and the 
fulfillment of the requirements should be assessed. Considering 
this, it is rather unexpected that we are making this step 
together with Warsaw. 
  [Martonyi] I do not think that any major change has taken 
place or that the announcement in Warsaw was unexpected. From 
the very beginning, we indicated that Hungary would consult with 
the Visegrad countries on the issue of handing in the membership 
request. We had already had consultations with Warsaw in 
connection with other talks, and this also included 
consultations between the relevant ministers. As a result of 
all these, the decision was made that we would submit our 
membership request essentially at the same time. 
  [Szego] So not at the same time after all? 
  [Martonyi] Due to technical reasons, it will not happen 
exactly at the same time. Instead of the originally planned 31 
March, 1 April seems to be a definite date, and the Polish 
Government's statement of intent will come a few days after this 
at the latest. It has not yet been decided when Foreign 
Minister Olechowski will find a suitable time for travelling to 
Athens. Minor issues like Easter Friday falling on 1 April might 
also influence this, therefore, it is quite possible that this 
event will only take place on the following week. 
  [Szego] Is the Warsaw government also past the phase of 
parliamentary approval? 
  [Martonyi] The situation is different in Poland, they do not 
need a legislative decision, only a simpler parliamentary 
procedure has to be completed. This is planned for 25 March, 
therefore, by the end of the month they will also have finished 
the preparations. The essence of this procedure is that, in the 
name of the government, the foreign minister informs Parliament 
of the decision on presenting the membership request, then the 
parliamentary group leaders have five minutes each to comment on 
this issue. However, there is no voting, the chairman of 
parliament sums up the speeches, and then the session is closed. 
  [Szego] Do we need to worry that, due to the heated debate 
that has developed in the European Union in connection with the 
membership of the European Free Trade Association [EFTA] 
countries, this is not the best time for new applicants to 
appear? For example, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes simply 
said the other day that there is a "complete crisis" in the 
Union. 
  [Martonyi] The current "mini crisis" has nothing to do with 
the presentation of the Hungarian request for membership, it is 
wise to separate these two issues. In addition to this, by the 
time the actual negotiations on membership begin -- at the end 
of 1996 or in 1997 at the earliest -- the European Union will 
have gone through many crisis periods. Therefore, this is an 
important step in the often mentioned long process of gaining 
membership that began in 1990: After handing in the request, we 
will be official candidates in a diplomatic, legal, and 
political sense.

<F P=106> [Andras Kovacs article: "Whom Would You Not Elect?"] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] What are the chances of a 
campaign that is conducted against the competing parties in 
Hungary? We wanted to get an answer to this question on the 
basis of a survey of a 1,000-head sample representing the 
country's population over the age of 15 that was carried out by 
the Szonda Ipsos Public Opinion Research company in January 1994. 
  During the survey, the people questioned first had to say 
whether they find it acceptable for a person who is in one of 
the following nine groups to become a member of the next 
government and plays an important political role. The replies 
were as follows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The answers show that the vast majority of the Hungarian 
population has no objections against a young, national minority, 
atheist, or Jewish person playing a leading role in Hungarian 
politics. For about two-thirds of the voters, it is not an 
important factor making a political role impossible if someone 
is adulterous or if his parents were communist leaders. 
However, only half of those who replied considered leading 
positions in the previous regime compatible with a future 
governmental position, and the majority of the public clearly 
rejects those who have moved back from abroad or are 
homosexuals: Nearly two-thirds of the questioned people 
considered it unacceptable for them to have a serious political 
position. 
  Apart from those who oppose the political role of people 
returning from abroad, the social-demographic characteristics of 
people who reject the other groups are very similar. Elderly 
people, people with lower levels of education, people living in 
small villages, people with low incomes, and those who are 
inactive or dependent are represented more than the average. 
People with lower schooling generally gave more negative 
answers than the average. The rejection of people under 35, 
those who are returning from abroad, who are adulterous, 
atheists, or homosexuals increases with the increase of age, and 
it is mainly village dwellers who reject those who deceive their 
partners, Jews, and homosexuals taking on a political role. It 
is worth looking at the answers in relation to the political 
orientation of the person replying (Table 2). Examining the 
left-wing, liberal, and conservative voters in groups -- placing 
all those who selected a party in one of the groups -- we can 
see that an important political role when the person is young, 
member of a national minority, of Jewish origin, adulterous, or 
homosexual is most acceptable to the liberal voters. The liberal 
voters mainly reject those who are returning from abroad or 
played a political role in the previous system, and most of them 
do not find the political role of homosexuals acceptable, 
although fewer of them reject this than people among the 
conservative voters. 
  Naturally, the largest proportion of left-wing voters find 
it 
acceptable for atheists, children of communist parents, and 
former functionaries to play an important political role, but a 
large majority of them do not reject the political role of 
national minority or Jewish people. However, it is interesting 
that more of them reject young people -- on this issue, they are 
closer to the views of the conservative voters -- and they 
particularly reject people returning from abroad. On this 
issue, the liberal and conservative voters are closer to each 
other, just as in the rejection of the future important role of 
former leaders. 
  The conservative voters are extremely opposed to homosexuals 
or former cadres taking on political roles, however, they are 
mainly in contrast with the majority of the whole population in 
the fact that their majority finds it unacceptable for children 
of communist parents to have an important role in the country's 
leadership. [passage omitted]

  It is also worth examining which of the various views belong 
together, which ones might form a group of opinions that 
expresses some kind of a common attitude. The statistical 
analysis distinguished three groups of opinions. The first 
group in which the views rejecting adulterous, atheist, Jewish, 
and homosexual people appear together is obviously characterized 
by a traditional and prejudiced attitude. The second group of 
opinions, which is dominated by the rejection of former 
functionaries and the children of communist parents, is 
characterized by an anti-communist attitude, while the third 
group of opinions, in which the rejection of people under the 
age of 35 and those returning from abroad are together, can be 
seen as a conservative attitude. [passage omitted] 
  The distribution of the replies indicates the dilemmas into 
which a "negative campaign" can sweep parties belonging to the 
various groups. According to the data, the relative majority of 
those who replied represent a liberal attitude at the moment, 
but it can also be seen that some one-fifth of the liberal, 
left-wing, and uncertain voters, mainly those of lower social 
status, can easily change their mind under the influence of a 
powerful negative campaign. It is not certain that this kind of 
campaign would, at the same time, strengthen the conservative 
parties, because many of their voters have a liberal attitude 
and a vehement negative campaign can make these people uncertain 
in their choice of party, as was seen after Istvan Csurka's 
[them member of the Hungarian Democratic Forum] actions in the 
summer of 1992. 
  It is also striking that the voters of left-wing and 
conservative parties are mainly divided by their attitude to the 
previous system, rather than by their relationship to the 
liberal and conservative attitudes. While 60 percent of the 
voters of liberal parties belong to the group characterized by a 
liberal attitude and 40 percent to the conservative attitude, 
the proportion in the case of the voters of left-wing and 
conservative parties is the opposite: Some 40 percent of them 
are characterized by liberal attitudes and 60 percent by 
conservative attitudes. Therefore, from this point of view, the 
profile of left-wing and conservative voting bases are similar 
to each other. [passage omitted] 
  In the course of our survey, we attempted to find out if 
there is a group in society that is consistently mistaken in its 
judgment on the distribution of opinions and is, as a result, 
more susceptible to the influence of campaign messages. We 
examined how many times the people surveyed were able to say 
what the majority view was on the nine questions they were 
asked, and how many times they were wrong. 
  On the basis of the social and demographic characteristics, 
the group that was completely unable to give an estimate can be 
best isolated from the rest: Many more people over the age of 
60, with lower schooling, with income in the lowest 10 percent, 
who are religious, and many of whom said they did not wish to 
participate in the elections can be found in this group than the 
average. Accurate estimates were mainly given by people in 
Budapest, with highest incomes, and people in their 50's. These 
social groups have many Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] 
supporters, therefore, the proportion of people giving accurate 
estimates was also higher than the average among the MSZP 
supporters. 
  However, there is not much difference in the accuracy of the 
estimates between the various groups of voters, although 
somewhat more of the opposition supporters were able to form an 
accurate opinion on the public view. 
  To sum up the results of the survey, we can say that the 
majority of Hungarian society definitely rejects the future 
political role of only homosexuals and people returning from 
abroad, and to a smaller extent, functionaries of the former 
regime, and the vast majority formed an accurate view of 
society's dominant views. It is unlikely that the other 
stereotypes of a possible negative campaign would have much 
influence. Therefore, people against whom these campaigns are 
directed do not risk much if they respond, thereby strengthening 
the consensus of the majority. 
  Nevertheless, there is a group in society that might also be 
vulnerable to a negative campaign. However, for the bigger 
parties, giving gestures to this group of people might be risky 
because this might alienate the rest of their voters. In 
addition to this, this group's willingness to vote is rather 
low, and a negative campaign is mainly suitable for changing the 
views of already committed voters, rather than for mobilizing 
people.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Which Party Will Solve the Economic </F>
Problems? -- Median-Poll on Party Programs"] 
  [Text] Every sober political force hopes that the election 
campaign will not get rough, and its main issue will be the 
competition between party programs. Therefore, it is important 
to know what the citizens think about the parties, whether they 
have a program and, if so, whether their program provides 
answers that are also regarded as important by the public. 
  At the beginning of the election campaign, 45 percent of 
citizens did not know that there were parties that had already 
formulated their programs for the upcoming elections; 3 percent 
thought that there were no such parties, and 3 percent thought 
that every party had a program. 
  Only 29 percent of those who do not want to vote think that 
some parties have already formulated their programs, and only 59 
percent of those who will certainly go to vote think this. 
Those who think that at least a few parties are preparing for 
the elections with programs mainly think of parliamentary 
parties. 
  The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] held its 
program-formulating general meeting two weeks before this 
opinion poll. Only 20 percent of the people surveyed had heard 
about this meeting, and this also shows that the good position 
of the SZDSZ is due not so much to information, but to the fact 
that a considerable number of citizens have consistently 
regarded the SZDSZ (as well as the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF]) as a program party since the 1990 elections. 
  It is also important to know the extent to which supporters 
of individual parties "follow their feelings" and the extent to 
which they evaluate the party program. We cannot give an exact 
answer to this question, but the way voters judge their own 
parties is also characteristic from this viewpoint. 
  Supporters of the SZDSZ, the Hungarian Socialist Party 
[MSZP] 
and the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP] are higher the 
average in thinking that their party has an election program, 
while supporters of the MDF are more uncertain than the average. 
A considerable proportion of voters for the Christian 
Democratic People's Party [KDNP] is made up of women older than 
60, living in villages, and disinterested in politics; in their 
election decisions, religion plays a bigger role than the party 
programs. In this respect, the Federation of Young Democrats 
[Fidesz] resembles the two government parties more than the 
opposition parties. Since shrinking to a third of the figures 
prevailing in December 1992, the Fidesz supporters are 
increasingly connected to a certain age group: Half of the 
present Fidesz supporters are younger than 30 and three-quarters 
are young than 40. Political disinterest can often be found 
among the younger generation, and many of them are only 
attracted to Fidesz for emotional reasons. 
  There is a broad consensus in the fact that politics should 
first of all solve the economic problems; however, many voters 
have no idea which party could best solve the problems facing 
the Hungarian economy. Many voters do not think that the party 
they want to vote for is capable of doing this. This shows the 
limited commitment of some of the Hungarian voters. These are 
facts that every party should face more deliberately during the 
election campaign. 
  About the same number of people expect economic improvement 
from the MSZP and the MDF as the number of people who would vote 
for these two parties, but we are not talking about exactly the 
same people. Some 4 percent more people than the actual 
supporters think that the SZDSZ could improve the economic 
situation. Almost the same applies to the FKGP. However, only 
a small percentage of their supporters think that the Fidesz and 
the KDNP could improve the economy. 
  The new government will have several possibilities at its 
disposal to solve the economic problems. The surveyors of the 
Median Opinion Poll Institute asked the people surveyed to 
choose three out of 10 possibilities they regard as the most 
important to implement, and another three possibilities they 
regard as the least important to implement. On of a scale of 
100, the figures under 50 show that people do not regard the 
implementation of the given task as particularly important, and 
the figures above 50 show that they regard it as important. On 
another scale of 100, the people in the survey listed the four 
most popular parties according to the extent these parties would 
strive to solve a given task if they became part of the 
government. Only 18 percent of the people were able to list the 
parties according to all the 10 tasks. Some 36 percent of the 
people could not list the parties. This also means that the 
data represent the opinion of more politically-informed people. 
This explains that, while a relative majority expects the MSZP 
to improve the economy, the SZDSZ is leading regarding the 
impelementation of every concrete task. Among the four parties, 
the MDF is rejected the most. In two cases, however, the MSZP 
came in the last place: People generally do not regard the flow 
of foreign capital and privatization as goals of the socialists. 
However, this will not cause the MSZP to lose many voters, 
because the majority of people do not regard the aforementioned 
tasks as really important.

  [Text] The Defense Ministry spokesman reports that the 
press organs and mass media have recently presented the news on 
the lifting of the U.S. embargo against Albania, which also 
applied to former communist countries. 
  The Defense Ministry of the Republic of Albania received 
official confirmation from the press secretary's office in the 
White House. In Presidential Act 94/18, dated 22 March 1994, 
U.S. President Bill Clinton states: In continuance of 
prerogatives granted to me from Part 503-A of the Law on Foreign 
Assistance dated 1961, with amendments, and from Part 3-A, 
Article 1, of the Law on Control of Export of Arms, I define 
that the supply with articles and defense services for the 
Governments of Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 
and Romania will strengthen the security of the United States 
and encourage world peace. 
  This decision by President Clinton is another expression of 
the successful development of relations between Albania and the 
United States and is a clear indication of the extension of 
close political, economic, and administrative relations, as well 
as those in the field of defense. This news has been welcomed 
by the military and all the Army staffs, as well as by the broad 
public of our people.

  [Text] Greek Embassy Secretary (Toulupas) was summoned on 
26 March to the Foreign Ministry and was handed a note of 
protest regarding an event on 21 March 1994 in which a group of 
Albanians who had crossed the Albanian-Greek border were 
mistreated by the Greek border forces. 
  According to exact data, after pointing an automatic rifle 
at 
the chest of 21-year-old Albanian citizen Alfred Abaz Muco, a 
resident of Bubullime in Lushnje, a Greek soldier opened fire 
with no reason at all, causing his death. 
  The note stresses among other things that the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Albania protests this ugly 
and tragic act, pointing out that such actions impair 
Albanian-Greek relations, create an unjustified situation of 
tension, and run counter to international norms and statements 
by the Greek authorities. 
  The note asks the Greek Government to give the necessary 
explanations about the circumstances of the event and take 
measures to condemn the culprits and prevent the repetition of 
such actions,which have occurred even in the past.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Lubor Kohout: "From Baudys's Realm of Fantasy </F>
II"] 
  [Text] We recently reported that a bank of viral strains 
was destroyed on 25 February under extraordinary security 
measures on the order of Defense Minister Antonin Baudys. It 
had been stored in a building leased by the Army to the Klinlab 
limited company. Then, at the beginning of March, under similar 
conditions, Army experts destroyed yet another "common" batch of 
viral strains stored in the Military Research Institute in 
Techonin. The defense minister, Chief of the General Staff 
Nekvasil, and other military top brass have described the two 
banks as common batches that had nothing to do with the 
development of biological weapons. Although, according to the 
claims made by the gentlemen from the Defense Ministry and the 
General Staff, the two viral banks were stored safely and there 
was no risk of a leak or a potential threat to the population 
from the stored viruses, the subsequent conduct by the 
ministerial and military top brass is tantamount to the contrary. 
  The Stresovice bank of viruses was stored in a so-called 
nitrogen chamber. It is located in the second basement of the 
building belonging to the Klinlab company. A bank of tissue 
cultures was also deposited there alongside the "harmless and 
safely stored" viral bank. Tissue cultures are cellular lines 
intended for the reproduction of viruses in a living organism. 
The location in question was locked, and only a limited number 
of staff from the Central Military Health Institute had access 
to the keys. The viruses and the tissue cultures were stored in 
containers full of liquid nitrogen, which has to be topped up 
once a week. Last August, one of the containers--by 
coincidence, the one with the bank of tissue cultures--was left 
open. All of the nitrogen had evaporated and so the tissue 
cultures were destroyed. Of course, it takes more than a few 
minutes or hours for nitrogen to evaporate. According to the 
experts, it takes five to seven days for this. Throughout this 
entire period, however, no one went into the nitrogen chamber, 
or, if someone did, he did not secure the container, despite the 
fact that it would have been impossible to overlook the 
unfastened lid and the escaping vapors. So, the batches of 
tissue cultures were destroyed. By the way, they were the 
largest in the Czech Republic, and their procreation took 30 
years, which is another matter. 
  An investigation was initiated and conducted by the police 
in 
Prague 6. The culprit was not found. There are more 
variations. These include an accident or oversight--relatively 
unlikely--and sabotage, which is more likely. In this event, 
another two possibilities can be taken into consideration: 
first, that the culprit or culprits intended to destroy what 
was actually destroyed--that is, the bank of tissue cultures. 
But why? Simply to make sure they do not exist? The second 
possibility is that this was a mistake and the other container 
with the viral bank should have been left open. In this case, 
dangerous viruses would have escaped into the surrounding 
environment, and not only the patients and staff in the Central 
Military Hospital would have been placed at direct risk. This 
could have been called, without exaggeration, a catastrophe. 
Understandably, there is also the possibility that someone 
wanted to remove, and perhaps even did remove, something from 
either of the banks. It is not difficult to guess for what 
purpose. One can only speculate about which country is 
supposed, for example, to have its source of drinking water 
infected. It just remains for me to add that, if the lid had 
stayed shut, it goes without saying that no one would have had 
any idea that some unknown person had been in the nitrogen 
chamber. It is impossible to say whether he had visited it for 
the first time. So, this was the situation with the, according 
to the defense minister, "safely stored harmless and common 
viruses that were not intended for use as biological weapons." 
During their news conference, the defense minister and his 
retinue declared that nothing had in fact happened and that 
biological weapons have never been developed or stored in our 
country. The two rapidly, and under extraordinary security 
measures, destroyed viral banks were, according to them, common 
batches. Of course, they did not say a word about what happened 
in Stresovice last August. It would probably be difficult for 
them to say that there is no risk and that there was not a risk. 
It would also be difficult for them to say that everything is in 
order in the Army and that biological weapons were never 
developed in it. It would be difficult for Deputy Minister 
Kalousek to talk nonsense and claim that the Army will save 50 
million by transferring some of the activity carried out 
hitherto by the Central Military Health Institute to the Klinlab 
limited company. And so on and so on.

<F P=106> [Article by "ryc": "According to Klaus, the Deliberations </F>
About the RFE Moving Are Premature"] 
  [Text] Prague--Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus described on 
Wednesday [23 March] the deliberations on the conditions for 
moving the Free Europe Center (Radio Free Europe--RFE) from 
Munich to Prague as definitely premature because the U.S. party 
has not yet made its decision. Klaus said this before reporters 
in response to a RUDE PRAVO question on Wednesday. He added 
that the original promises that this matter "will be settled in 
October, December, February, and March are being constantly 
postponed." Klaus considers the transfer of the RFE from "a 
clearly government, state institution to another" an additional 
problem. Businessman Soros would "participate as a co-owner" in 
dealing with the latter problem. If this happened, the entire 
problem would move, according to the prime minister, to an 
entirely different level.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Today is not a rest day for the new 
Slovak Government. Members of the Cabinet have been meeting in 
expert groups to prepare their programmatic statement. Our 
correspondent Michal Tvarozek asked Prime Minister Jozef 
Moravcik which were the most important areas, especially in the 
economy, that the government wants to accelerate. 
  [Begin recording] [Moravcik] The most fundamental problem is 
putting together the economic program. The largest group of 
experts is working precisely on this program. We will probably 
have to revise some measures proposed by the previous government 
in preparing the budget. We will have to revise these measures 
to make them more realistic. We will have to do everything 
possible to reach agreement with the international institutions, 
particularly the IMF and the World Bank. 
  In other areas, the most complicated situation has arisen in 
health and education. [passage omitted] 
  [Tvarozek] Presumably the first version of the government's 
program will serve also as a consultative document for, let us 
say, employers, trade unions, all those who have a say as far as 
the government's statement is concerned. 
  [Moravcik] Certainly we have to do this. We have to respect 
the general agreement. The general agreement is for us a very 
important document, and we would like to have observations of 
all involved parties when working on the first version of the 
statement. 
  [Tvarozek] In one hour, you are going to attend the 
extraordinary session of the government. It is possible that 
the agenda will center precisely on the conclusions reached by 
these expert groups. 
  [Moravcik] This session should not deal with specific 
problems. We will discuss where we stand, what we ought to do 
next in terms of next week's work, and we will clarify which are 
the main problems that have arisen when working on these 
materials. 
  [Tvarozek] Let us assume that the National Council will not 
agree with your policy statement. What will happen if it is not 
approved? 
  [Moravcik] I hope it will be approved. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by </F>
Radiozurnal editor Michal Tvarozek; place and date not given; 
from the "Ten Minutes with the Prime Minister" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Tvarozek] At the beginning of this week, you were 
in Prague, where you met Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus for 
unofficial talks. There are certain signs from which one can 
assume that both the prime minister and the Czech Government are 
still a bit restrained in their contacts with the new Slovak 
Government. Do you think the reason for this might be that they 
are trying to keep a back door open in case Vladimir Meciar 
returns? 
  [Moravcik] I was taking part in the European Banking Forum 
and used this opportunity to meet Prime Minister Klaus, whom I 
know very well from my previous activity. Our talks can be 
characterized, mainly on the part of Vaclav Klaus, as a kind of 
finding out how we [the Slovak Government] think and what this 
government intends to do in the short period of six months. I 
think we managed to agree that, in this period of six months, 
there is enough space to intensify our mutual contacts and that 
we are confident we are able to solve some still unresolved 
problems. 
  [Tvarozek] Do you already have any idea how to keep contacts 
and resolve some of the pressing issues? 
  [Moravcik] I am not going to talk about specific actions, 
specific proposals, and measures because all of this is in the 
stage of intensive preparations. I do not wish to jump the gun 
now and generate some media hullabaloo. 
  [Tvarozek] Despite this, I would like to touch on one 
specific issue, which is the issue of the common border. It has 
not been finalized yet, and some points of contention exist. 
Are you going to change anything in the concept of possible 
mutual compensation for territories, or have some other options 
been prepared in this respect? 
  [Moravcik] We are prepared to follow the results achieved at 
the interior minister level of the two countries. I think a 
certain basis offering solutions does actually exist here. At 
the same time, we must make sure, in a very vigorous way, that 
complete compensation for the territories is implemented. Quite 
simply, I think it is possible to discuss this issue or this 
problem so that the interests of our two republics are taken 
into consideration to the maximum possible, or full extent. 
  [Tvarozek] It is natural that each prime minister or 
minister 
brings with him to his new office a circle of his colleagues on 
whom he can rely. But is there a limit to this? Some 
ministries are axing people who do not actually hold top jobs. 
The same can be said about some district councils. Prime 
Minister, is there not a chance that fears of uncertainty or of 
some kind of mutual settling of accounts might arise? 
  [Moravcik] It would be very counterproductive to talk about 
a 
settling of accounts. I definitely oppose this kind of 
practice. I think we should follow the policy aimed at adopting 
a professional and expert approach. We agreed on this, we 
agreed on this in the government and during the coalition talks. 
Thus, we have a certain policy, and we wish to steadfastly 
stick to it. 
  [Tvarozek] In this respect, would it not be a solution if 
the 
state secretaries were appointed by the parliament so that their 
appointments would not be the outcome of coalition talks, but 
that, as experts, they would form a permanent structure in the 
ministries and so on? 
  [Moravcik] The state secretaries position must not be 
regarded as a constant in our constitutional system. They are a 
composite part of the executive power, and, in fact, they 
deputize for the minister to a considerable extent. Thus, from 
this viewpoint, if they were elected by the parliament, this 
would not be a composite part of the whole constitutional system. 
  [Tvarozek] As early as at the first government meeting, you 
abolished the decision of the former government and dismissed 
the regional job center commissioners. What were the reasons 
that compelled you to do this? 
  [Moravcik] These institutions were not legally justified, 
and, because we have put off the territorial division of the 
state until after the elections, they were not justified in 
material terms, either. 
  [Tvarozek] Is this not a political issue then? 
  [Moravcik] There is a political aspect to this issue because 
maintaining these offices would have contradicted Slovakia's 
interests. 
  [Tvarozek] The so-called screening law has been a much 
discussed issue of late. Although this law is in force, it is 
not observed everywhere and, from time to time, as happened 
recently, contradictory findings surface. Prime Minister, do 
you have any idea what course of action you are going to take? 
Are you going to observe it and demand that it is strictly 
adhered to, or are you going to table an amendment to this law? 
  [Moravcik] The screening law is a part of our legal system. 
This means that the government must respect it. That is one 
thing. At the present time, a proposal as to whether this law 
conforms to our Constitution and to our international 
undertakings has been lodged at the Constitutional Court. We 
will wait and see what the Constitutional Court verdict is, and 
then we might make a decision. 
  [Tvarozek] It is reported that teachers are preparing 
protest 
actions for 27 March because this is Teachers' Day. Other 
professional associations voiced their dissatisfaction with 
social conditions, too. Are you preparing any measures of 
fundamental importance that would prevent such high escalation 
of dissatisfaction? 
  [Moravcik] Unfortunately, the state budget does not allow 
for 
fundamental measures that would completely eliminate the problem 
that exists in this ministry or in this sphere. But we 
definitely want to do something. We have already started 
discussing this issue with the relevant trade unions. 
  [Tvarozek] The budget can be replenished, above all, by the 
results of our work or by exports. What is being prepared in 
this respect? It is precisely at this time, when Defense 
Minister Pavol Kanis and some specialists are visiting Israel. 
Do you expect that developments of this kind will result in 
closer contacts with foreign partners? 
  [Moravcik] We are currently defining our policies or, in 
other words, the policy statement of the government. It should 
be a very specific and matter-of-fact document. Written in it 
will be the basic measures we want to implement. We will make 
use of our diplomacy and our foreign contacts to gain aid from 
abroad. 
  [Tvarozek] The government has been in office for one week 
now. How do you assess its work, and do you have any comments on 
or objections to the work of any ministries or ministers? 
  [Moravcik] It is a very short time for me to pass any 
judgment, but, on the basis of the information I have so far, I 
can unequivocally say that there is a very strong will and 
enough enthusiasm to enable us to solve all of the problems we 
have set ourselves to solve. 
  [Tvarozek] The government really consists of three elements, 
so to speak. The degree of consistency of these three elements 
will most probably depend on the goals. If we take those six 
months, for example, is the goal identical? 
  [Moravcik] We are trying to define this identical goal, but 
we do not want it to be limited by six months. We said to 
ourselves that we must draft a concept for long-term development 
and decide which steps we have to take in order to implement 
this long-term concept over the six months because we are 
expecting this political grouping to retain an important 
influence after the elections, as well. 
  [Tvarozek] Do you mean an important influence in the 
government, in parliament, or an important influence as a strong 
opposition group? 
  [Moravcik] Well, our aim is to win a majority.

  [Text] Following today's [25 March] meeting of the Cabinet 
members nominated by the Party of the Democratic Left with 
journalists, we interviewed Brigita Snegnerova, the deputy prime 
minister responsible for the economy, who has returned from a 
study trip to the United States of America. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Deputy Prime 
Minister, which problems in Slovakia's economy do you regard as 
being a priority at the present time? 
  [Snegnerova] There are very many of them, and listing them 
would probably take some time. We would like to focus to a 
considerable extent on an accelerated continuation of the 
process in the privatization sphere. 
  We would like to aim in particular at generating, through 
privatization, private companies capable of creating job 
opportunities for people and producing goods that could compete 
abroad. Thus, they would help us solve the situation in our 
foreign trade and in improving the foreign trade balance. This 
is linked to another objective of the government's economic 
policy, which is that much stronger emphasis will be placed on 
trade policies, in particular on export-promoting policies. 
  [Correspondent] Recently, you had a meeting with the World 
Bank executive director and IMF representatives, and you visited 
the United States Department of the Treasury and other important 
institutions. Have these meetings yielded anything positive for 
Slovakia? 
  [Snegnerova] I would like to sum up very briefly the 
conclusions of these meetings. Support for the new Slovak 
Government was voiced at all of the meetings. They voiced 
confidence that the new Slovak Government would speed up the 
transformation of Slovak society, the democratization of Slovak 
society, and that it would speed up the economic transformation. 
  We agreed with the IMF that, as early as before the final 
drafting of the economic and political section of the government 
statement, we would hold several rounds of talks with Mr. 
Zervudakis, a member of the staff responsible for Slovakia. 
These talks should make sure that the policy the government 
will submit to the parliament is acceptable to both sides. This 
step is significant because the IMF's positive approach to the 
government economic policy could mean the speeding up of the 
talks on the standby loan. As you know, the significance of 
this loan does not lie only in boosting our currency funds; it 
amounts, above all, to the expression of support for the 
economic policy of the government, and, at the same time, is an 
expression of support for the Slovak economy. It will be an 
important signal for foreign investors, be they institutions or 
strategic investors. Our efforts will be aimed at attracting 
these investors. Along with the approval of a standby loan or, 
rather, when we start drawing this loan, we will get the second 
(?part of the stand-by) loan. This has already been approved, 
but there is a condition attached to the drawing of the second 
stage. 
  [Correspondent] When, in your view, could Slovakia get the 
standby loan? 
  [Snegnerova] Provided that talks proceed well, it could be 
within the next few months. [end recording]

  [Text] In a public opinion poll conducted by the 
Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic in March, 1,273 
citizens were asked to reply to the question: "Which politician 
active in the Slovak Republic enjoys your trust at present?" 
The replies acquired do not yet reflect the situation that 
arose after the 27th meeting of the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic with its consequences [passage of the vote of 
no-confidence in Vladimir Meciar's government and the 
appointment of a new government]. Compared with the poll 
carried out in early February, there was a visible increase in 
trust in President Michal Kovac and a reduction in the 
proportion of citizens who do not trust any politician.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak 
on 24 March on page 1 carries a 400-word commentary by Alena 
Gottweisova entitled "The Fifth Rider." The commentary takes 
issue with leaflets being distributed in Slovakia by "youngsters 
who identify with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]" 
and who "demand from the recipients of the leaflets the promise 
that they will vote for Vladimir Meciar." According to 
Gottweisova, these leaflets portray "a smiling gentleman with a 
dollar sign on his pocket making a telephone call to Prague, 
Budapest, and Tel Aviv and reporting that `the putsch against 
the Slovak nation and state has come off' and that they can thus 
come to ransack Slovakia without having to fear resistance." To 
"dispel doubts about the identity of this gentleman who is 
carrying out orders from abroad," Gottweisova continues, "he 
finally introduces himself as `your own Michal Kovac, alias the 
president.'" In her commentary, Gottweisova deplores the 
"wrath" of the leaflets' authors as well as their "racist 
connotation." She describes as "absurd" both the view of 
President Kovac as an enemy of Slovakia and the idea that 
"Vladimir Meciar's dismissal had been organized in Prague, 
Budapest, and Tel Aviv with the intention of destroying 
Slovakia."

  [Excerpt] Delegates to the fourth nationwide assembly of 
the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] are gathered in 
the district office in Presov today. Our correspondents Anna 
Samelova and Ivan Samel report from Presov: 
  [Samel] Good morning to you from Presov. About 200 citizens 
have been waiting for the delegates to the congress since this 
morning. The movement's chairman, Vladimir Meciar, joined them 
shortly before 1000 and addressed the gathering. 
  [Samelova] In his brief address, Vladimir Meciar recalled 
that, with the voters' support, the HZDS had resolved the issue 
of the Slovak Republic's statehood. Now, it is to resolve the 
issue of the peace and prosperity of the state. Vladimir Meciar 
thinks it would be sensible to complete what was begun in the 
referendum or, in other words, the issue of early elections. 
That is why one of the main points of the assembly's 
deliberations will be to draft the movement's policy for the 
election period 1994-98. The implementation of this policy will 
begin next Monday. We lost a major battle in the parliament, 
Vladimir Meciar went on to say, but we will win the war. The 
HZDS chairman then handed the floor to Ivan Gasparovic [Slovak 
parliament speaker], who, in essence, reiterated what Vladimir 
Meciar had said. 
  [Samel] Following the gala opening of the assembly and 
addresses by invited political parties, the agenda of the 
assembly has begun. 
  Despite the fact that he has not been invited to the 
assembly, the president of the Republic, who is still an HZDS 
member, has at least sent a greetings message to the congress. 
It says that the HZDS is a substantial political force in 
Slovakia, whose position in the center of the political spectrum 
attracts hundreds of thousands of citizens with most varied 
opinions. 
  I quote from the letter: It would not be correct if I were 
to 
conceal the tension between the HZDS chairman and the president, 
which gradually grew into open attacks against the president of 
the Slovak Republic. Even though this tension does exist, its 
nature is not personal. However, as a social and political 
conflict, it had a negative impact on the developments in our 
country as a whole. As president, I had to take a position on 
this. I expressed my position in the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic. At the same time, I urged all political 
entities to support the policy of national, political, and civic 
reconciliation. It is our duty to seek and choose decisions and 
solutions that will satisfy not only us but, first and foremost, 
our fellow citizens. 
  In the conclusion of his letter, Michal Kovac wished the 
congress peaceful proceedings and expressed the hope that the 
congress would be a continuation of the best policies that 
yielded undeniable success for the HZDS over the past three 
years. 
  [Samelova] According to the information we have, no one has 
yet read the contents of the letter from the president to the 
assembly delegates. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The participants in the fourth congress of the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] in Presov have sent an 
open letter to Slovak President Michal Kovac. More from Martin 
Dorazin: 
  [Dorazin] We ask you to reassess your membership in the 
HZDS, 
states the letter addressed to Michal Kovac. Among other 
things, the letter from the congress of the strongest Slovak 
opposition party recalls that the current president used to be a 
leading representative of the HZDS, which nominated him to the 
Federal Assembly, later on as the assembly's chairman and then 
as president of the Slovak Republic. 
  The congress regrets having come to the conclusion that 
Michal Kovac has interrupted the continuity of the HZDS program. 
The HZDS can no longer support Kovac in the office of president 
of the Republic because of the way he carries out his 
presidential duties, because of the attempt to cause the HZDS's 
disintegration, and because of an unjustifiable attitude toward 
the government that founded the state, and for other reasons. 
This is all in the open letter. [passage omitted]
