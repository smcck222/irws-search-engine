<F P=106> [TA SR report: "We Must Make Up for What We Have Missed; </F>
Brigita Schmognerova in the World Bank"] 
  [Text] Washington--Slovakia will seek to obtain a World 
Bank loan for the structural reform of the entrepreneurial and 
financial sector (EFSAL). The condition for obtaining this loan 
is a thorough analysis of the situation in the two sectors, but 
also [the realization of] a large number of measures that should 
have been implemented by the previous governments several years 
ago, Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova told the TA SR 
correspondent following her talks with Wilfried Thalwitz, 
executive director of the World Bank for Europe, and Kemal 
Dervis, director of the World Bank's European Department. 
  According to her words, even as early as during the start of 
preparations for privatization under the federation, clear 
criteria should have been laid down for the state's 
participation in the entrepreneurial sphere. The state's 
participation, through the medium of the National Property Fund, 
in the entrepreneurial sphere remains very high today, and its 
interference in the management of enterprises is excessive and 
extremely harmful. It is therefore necessary to determine very 
specifically under which conditions and until when the state 
will maintain its ownership stake in the entrepreneurial sphere. 
  Furthermore, the government must prepare, as soon as 
possible, a list of enterprises that it wants to privatize by 
the end of the year. It considers the previous government's 
commitment to privatize another one-fifth of enterprises to be 
the minimum. 
  Brigita Schmognerova said that it will also be necessary to 
start applying the law on bankruptcy and settlement with a clear 
idea about the consequences of its application. 
  Other measures necessary to obtain the loan include 
better-quality information about the entrepreneurial sphere and, 
in particular, reliable data for the past two years.

  [Text] Bratislava--Rudolf Filkus, minister of finance of 
the Slovak Republic, has temporarily frozen transfers of 
National Property Fund securities in the Securities Center 
[SCP]. As Dusan Koledzaj, director of the Slovak Finance 
Ministry's Capital Market Department, informed TA SR yesterday, 
this temporary measure went into effect as of 18 March 1994. 
The minister had been asked to take this step by Milan 
Janicina, minister for the administration and privatization of 
national property, on the basis of a preliminary inquiry into 
privatization projects approved by the previous government of 
Vladimir Meciar after 15 February, until the ministry's analysis 
is wound up. 
  [Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 24 March on page 2 carries a 
250-word TA SR report entitled "Inquiry Into Privatization." 
The report quotes Milan Janicina, minister for the 
administration and privatization of national property, as having 
told a news conference on 23 March that Prime Minister Meciar's 
government "approved approximately 45 privatization projects 
after 15 February, of which an estimated third do not conform to 
existing legislation." Janicina also said that those 
privatization projects that are "in conformity with the law and 
morality" will be respected.]

  [Excerpts] Banking councils of the National Bank of 
Slovakia and the Czech National Bank met in Smolenice today. 
Finance ministers of both countries, Rudolf Filkus and Ivan 
Kocarnik, were present at the meeting. Martin Dorazin, Czech 
Radio special correspondent in Bratislava has more details: 
  [Dorazin] The most important items on the meeting's agenda 
were the payments agreement between the Czech Republic and 
Slovakia and the division of assets and liabilities of the 
former Czechoslovak State Bank. [passage omitted] 
  Slovak Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus stressed that the old 
bloc must be abolished in a way that will not have an impact on 
the state budget. He added that both republics naturally are 
continuing to use the clearing method. 
  The governors of the two national banks voiced satisfaction 
with the fact that the problem of the division of assets and 
liabilities of the former Czechoslovak State Bank is being 
depoliticized. 
  Josef Tosovsky, governor of the Czech National Bank, sees 
progress in the fact that the division of assets and liabilities 
will continue to be worked on by accountants. Rudolf Filkus 
pointed out that the economic dimension is a priority in this 
case. Josef Tosovsky described as the greatest progress in the 
talks the fact that the Slovak bank did not cast doubt on the 
financial statement of the Czechoslovak State Bank, which means 
that it also does not cast doubt on the opening assets and 
liabilities statement of the national banks. The division of 
gold and the question of currency taken out of circulation 
remains an unresolved problem. 
  Minister Kocarnik expressed his surprise over the fact that 
Slovakia refuses to recognize certificates for food products 
issued by Czech standardization authorities, despite the fact 
that these are recognized by Germany and Hungary, for example. 
In the minister's view, however, this is a war between 
bureaucrats. I want to believe that ministers and governments 
will not succumb to these bureacrats, Ivan Kocarnik said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Stefan Grubac] </F>
  [Excerpts] It has been clear for a long time that the 
region of the former Yugoslavia is a testing ground for the 
balance of powers on the new geopolitical map of the world. 
After the disappearance of the Soviet Union, that is, after the 
severely impaired might of the second superpower, this balance 
also disappeared. Unfortunately, the setting of the new balance 
of powers is being tested on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia. This is where many values and principles of an 
epoch have been failing. This is where the principles from 
Helsinki and the principles of the CSCE have failed. This is 
where international law has failed. The United Nations could 
also be buried on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, this 
institution that -- despite many problems -- has had the 
greatest authority in the world for half a century. 
  Since the beginning of the Yugoslav crisis, there has been 
evidence that the United Nations does not have the inner 
strength to be up to the task. Instead of its own authority, 
this organization that used to be respected -- and, pathos 
aside, looked up to with hope by a large part of humankind -- 
has become only a shield and an instrument of the most powerful 
countries in the West, primarily the United States. 
  The latest decision of Secretary General Butrus-Ghali to 
allow Turkish troops into Bosnia within the UN peacekeepers is 
the most obvious indication that the United Nations is no longer 
capable of abiding by its own principles. The attitude that the 
neighboring countries of the former Yugoslavia, and countries 
that historically represented occupying forces here, cannot come 
as peacekeepers has been ignored. The reactions of Bulgaria and 
Greece best show what a danger that is to peace not only in 
former Yugoslavia, but in the entire Balkans. Bulgaria and 
Greece this time reacted in their own interests. The Security 
Council is setting a new time bomb, is the reaction in Bulgaria. 
Greek Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis says that one cannot 
at the same time be a participant in a clash and the keeper of 
peace in that clash. This is completely unreasonable, 
illogical, and dangerous, the Greek defense minister stresses. 
  A question arises here: Do the most powerful in the 
international community care about peace in the former 
Yugoslavia? We have in fact been all along witnesses to a double 
game, the apparent search for peace and the search for ways to 
avoid peace. Every time it seemed that peace was at hand, there 
was parallel action aimed at having the war continue. Therefore 
the stories that the key to peace lies in Serbia, Yugoslavia, or 
the Serbian side are stories for the hostile or the politically 
illiterate and uninformed. 
  In the shadow of the sensational decision to allow Turkish 
troops into Bosnia, Germany is creeping back into the Balkans, 
true, only politically so far. What does the administration of 
Mostar by the Germans mean? Just the above. Is it not the 
future of the former Yugoslav republics gradually to fall under 
the administration of foreign powers under the excuse of 
bringing peace, which is an age-old political excuse? Because 
of that hypocrisy -- the parallel search for peace and the 
instigation of war -- and to hide that hypocrisy from the their 
public and voters, those who conduct such a policy need 
political lies in the world media. But how to explain that to 
the world public, when the rich managers and brainwashers of 
that same public manipulate that very public with their media? 
[passage omitted] 
  The world has finally understood that Serbia is not an 
aggressor, but that apart from the others, Serbs, too, live in 
the former Croatia and the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Despite 
that, the world is gradually learning that the departure of the 
Serbs from the countries imposed on them by force is not the 
creation of greater Serbia but a constitution of a smaller 
Yugoslavia, in continuation of the country that existed for 70 
years. [sentence as heard] After all, that is the right that has 
been given to others, the right that was given to all the 
nations by United Nations itself. One more time: Is the United 
Nations to meet the fate of the League of Nations, its 
predecessor from between the two world wars, which was destroyed 
by the power struggle between the great powers?

<F P=106> [Interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic by </F>
Milorad Komrakov in Paris; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Komrakov] It is important to say that France is 
the first West European country, a member of the European Union, 
that has invited a top-level FRY [Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia] official for a visit. This is all the more 
significant if one knows that the French foreign minister 
insisted on the usefulness of such contacts. Mr. Jovanovic, I 
would like to ask you to assess your visit to France and your 
talks with the French officials briefly for Radio Television of 
Serbia. 
  [Jovanovic] Let me say right away that we are satisfied with 
this visit and talks with all the French officials both as far 
as the protocol and the contents are concerned. We have seen 
everywhere the same regret that the friendship resulting from 
history and the common faith of our countries in the two World 
Wars has been seriously disrupted because of the negative policy 
that France has conducted toward our country, particularly 
recently. We have also agreed that there is a common interest 
in repairing the damage as soon as possible, and that the policy 
should be renewed which -- both sides have agreed -- is in the 
interests of both sides and the stability and cooperation in 
Europe. 
  On the other hand, we could see that the time was over when 
our country and its policy were criticized, not to mention other 
kinds of insinuations, and that we have not heard in these talks 
any such criticism. On the contrary, there was a lot of 
emphasis on our views and attitudes concerning the situation and 
the development of the crisis on the Yugoslav territory, and 
particularly in connection with Bosnia-Herzegovina. In that 
sense, it has been made more than implicitly clear to us that 
our country is seen as an unavoidable factor and respected 
partner in the joint effort in the search for peace, and not as 
a country that [word indistinct] or a country that still has to 
sit on the bench for the accused. 
  [Komrakov] As we have learned, you insisted with the French 
foreign minister -- as far as Bosnia-Herzegovina is concerned -- 
on an equal status and treatment of all the sides, all three 
warring sides, and of course you again insisted on the lifting 
of the sanctions against Yugoslavia. 
  [Jovanovic] During all these talks, particularly with Mr. 
Juppe, we pointed out that the European Union owes our country 
and the Serb side in Bosnia, because of the plan of the European 
Union itself, the plan that we have accepted, which is very 
important for the preservation of the credibility of the 
European Union in our eyes, and the perspective of our 
continuous partnership cooperation in the search for peace and 
an overall settlement of the Yugoslav crisis. 
  [Komrakov] Were your French collocutors aware of the fact 
that it was the French official policy -- with some steps and 
moves -- that has contributed to the disruption of the 
traditionally good relations between France and Serbia? 
  [Jovanovic] The French side has found it necessary to 
mention itself some negative acts toward us in the solution of 
the Bosnian crisis recently. However, at the same time it wants 
to convince us that it has done so out of good, not bad, 
intentions toward us, and that their acts have been forced by 
tactical reasons to avoid an even less favorable development, 
and to gain ground to exert pressure on the other side, which -- 
by the way -- used to be insensitive to outside pressure. 
  [Komrakov] Thank you for the interview, Mr. Jovanovic.

<F P=106> [Report by Brana Filipovic and Radovan Radovanovic] </F>
  [Text] Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kontic is currently 
visiting the Timok region. Addressing the leadership of the 
municipality and the Bor mining and smelting works, the federal 
prime minister for the first time fully outlined the economic 
policy for 1994. The government measures will not deviate from 
Avramovic's program but will actually extend further. Federal 
Prime Minister Kontic also announced general economic reforms. 
The federal prime minister was accompanied by [Ministers] 
Nikola Sainovic and Tomislav Raicevic. Brana Filipovic and 
Radovan Radovanovic report: 
  Briefing the Yugoslav prime minister on the development work 
so far and the plans until 2005, Miroslav Cvetanovic, director 
general of the Bor copper combine, stressed that despite the 
sanctions, the Bor and Serbian giant has managed to keep up 
production in the past two years, utilize 70-80 percent of its 
capacities, and develop the Cerevo copper mine. The combine 
invested $40 million of its own money in the mine. 
  Speaking about the development program, Cvetanovic said that 
the combine plans to increase its production by one-third by 
2005, install a new transportation system on the mine's site, 
and secure $120 million for a new and extremely modern smelting 
plant. In a fairly long speech, Radoje Kontic said that the 
first stage of stabilizing the national currency has been 
successfully completed. 
  [Begin Kontic recording] The second stage of implementing 
the stabilization program, which is just starting, consists of a 
gradual revival of the total economic activity. Under the total 
economic activity, I mean the revival of current production and, 
of course, after that, increase in investment activities. 
  While preparing the economic policy for 1994, the federal 
government in fact accepted as its basis the concept and tenets 
contained in the program for reconstructing the monetary system 
and the strategy of the economic recovery of Yugoslavia, which 
was drafted by a group of experts led by Dr. Avramovic. 
However, in doing so, the federal government also borne in mind 
the analyses and assessments of the relevant federal ministries 
on the current economic and social situation in the country, the 
stands of the Economic Council of the federal government on the 
concept of the economic policy for 1994, as well as the views 
expressed in the program for macro-economic stabilization 
prepared by the (?CESMECON) Center for Economic Studies under 
the leadership of Professor Oskar Kovac. 
  The level of liberalization of our macroeconomic policies in 
1994 is certainly not below the average level of this 
liberalization in the so-called developed market economies. One 
of the particularly important tenets of the economic policy for 
1994 is the free but loyal competition of goods, services, 
knowledge, ideas, work force, and so forth. Those making 
business decisions will bear the risk and be completely 
responsible for business failures and losses. 
  In my view, it would be realistic to expect a further fall 
in 
prices in the period ahead. The direct consequence of slashing 
hyperinflation is the stabilization of the exchange rate of both 
the new and old dinar, their consolidation at a certain level, 
although I must say that some attempts have been made to 
destabilize the dinar through various speculative activities, 
the gray economy, and the evasion of obligations to society, 
through the so-called interest rate premiums [sticung], and so 
forth. 
  However, the additional measures of the economic policy, I 
would say, have successfully countered all these attempts, at 
least in the past two months, and the exchange rate of both the 
old and the new dinars has remained the same in the past two 
months. [end recording] 
  Radoje Kontic also said that the reasons for the poor 
economic results in the past should not only be sought in the 
monetary policy but also in the structural problems of the 
economy. In connection with this, he announced new systemic 
solutions and a new economic ambience. Radoje Kontic and his 
aides will visit the Majdanpek copper mine and Majdanpek gold 
works this afternoon.

<F P=106> [Report by Miloje Drobnjak from Bijelo Polje] </F>
  [Text] A rally is taking place in Bijelo Polje, addressed 
by members of the delegation of the Russian state Duma, led by 
Aleksandar Vengerovskiy, deputy chairman of the Russian lower 
house, who is also the deputy president of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Several thousand 
citizens of Bijelo Polje are attending the rally in the rain. 
  Russia lost its historical allies under Gorbachev. We are 
therefore here to mend that, to tell you that we will never 
desert you and forget you, (Vengerovskiy) said. He further said 
that the Balkans is the Russian zone of interest and influence, 
and that no Turkish or NATO presence will be allowed here. He 
added: Your enemies are our enemies. No new world order will 
be established so long as it is aimed against the nation that is 
fighting for its freedom, as is the case with the Serbian people. 
  Vengerovskiy further said: We are here to help you. We want 
to socialize and trade with you. Russia will again be the 
market for your products. Russia is today swamped with poor 
quality goods from Turkey and Syria, but we can remember with 
fondness your good quality clothes, shoes, and foodstuffs. 
  To shouts from the audience of "Russia, Serbia!," 
Vengerovskiy said that the Mediterranean Sea is a Slav sea, and 
that Russian ships, not U.S. ones, would sail in it. Other 
members of the delegation of the Russian state Duma addressed 
the rally, as did the leaders of the Serbian National Renewal, 
who organized the visit by the Russian parliamentarians.

  [Text] Pristina, 25 March (TANJUG) -- Ibrahim Rugova, 
president of the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo [DSK] and 
self-proclaimed president of the so-called "republic of Kosovo," 
today described his visit to the United States as an "important 
visit." 
  At a news conference he failed to comment at length on the 
activities of his "prime minister" Bujar Bukosi in Washington, 
where this man had requested support from U.S. officials for 
separatist demands for the secession of Kosovo and Metohija from 
Serbia, but stressed that these activities were "within the 
framework of regular visits to and contacts with the United 
States." 
  The DSK president welcomed the Belgian foreign minister's 
visit to Tirana, dubbing as "press speculations" hints that 
Willy Claes would convey to Albanian President Sali Berisha the 
European Union's stance on the inviolability of borders and its 
position that Kosmet [Kosovo and Metohija] Albanians can seek a 
solution only within the context of autonomy. 
  Not ruling out the possibility that Claes and Berisha could 
examine all options for resolving the Kosmet issue, Rugova 
declared that, as "president of Kosovo," a title he had bestowed 
upon himself, he would take into account the will of the 
Albanians expressed at the referendum. 
  This, he said, means "an independent and neutral Kosovo" 
which, in his view, is "a compromise solution acceptable to both 
Albanians and Serbs." 
  He described the Yugoslav Government's decision not to allow 
foreign missions in Kosovo as "confirmation of a stubborn and 
damaging policy pursued by the Serbian authorities." 
  Speaking about the German authorities' intention to deport 
several thousand Yugoslav refugees, mostly Albanians, Rugova 
said that he had received official assurances that this would be 
done "as painlessly as possible," but he failed to elaborate on 
what this meant.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andras Agoston, chairman of the Democratic </F>
Union of Vojvodina Hungarians, by Imre Sebestyen; place and date 
not given: "The VMDK Does Not Deal With the Issue of Border 
Modification"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Sebestyen] What is your 
opinion of the division within the leadership of the Democratic 
Union of Vojvodina Hungarians [VMDK] and the confrontation? 
  [Agoston] There have been different views within the VMDK 
from the very beginning. VMDK Deputy Chairman Sandor Hodi's 
political position has been the same from the very beginning: 
He starts from the premise that a new settlement will take 
place in this part of Europe and that a border modification is a 
realistic possibility within this new settlement. Thus, for 
him, the implementation of the autonomy concept is the minimum 
that the Serbian leadership should give us because the organized 
political opposition of the Vojvodina Hungarians and the 
international support the Hungarians receive in this forces the 
Serbs to do that. Dialogue and the daily political cooperation 
of coexisting people are not a necessary part of that concept. 
It does not count on the principle of partnership based on 
political subjectivity; instead, it counts on the fact that, as 
a result of favorable international circumstances, the Serbs 
will get into a subordinate position. Naturally, that political 
philosophy only covers the block Hungarians. Given the fact 
that it circumvents the issue of coexistence of people living in 
this area -- first of all the coexistence of Serbs and 
Hungarians -- the concept is abstract and unrealistic. As 
opposed to that -- and in my opinion this political philosophy 
still has greater support within the VMDK -- another line 
emerges as more realistic. The essence of it is that in the 
current situation, the issue of border modification should not 
be included in the political activity of the VMDK. We do not 
want to live in subjugation, but we know that we have to live in 
peace with the others in this region, first of all with the 
Serbs. The Hungarians here must be guaranteed a constitutional 
and legal framework in which they can preserve their identity, 
survive, and remain here without a border modification. This 
legal framework is the autonomy concept of the VMDK. The 
legality and democratic support make it possible for the VMDK to 
act as a political partner in settling the common affairs of the 
Hungarians living in the Carpathina basin. Our common goal is 
to make sure that Hungary becomes a member of the European Union 
as soon as possible and that the Hungarians living beyond 
Hungary's borders can implement their autonomy efforts. The 
results achieved so far prove that there is no politically 
relevant alternative to that idea. On the other side, of 
course, there is the danger that the so-called reformer 
politicians who are also increasingly forced into the background 
within the VMDK might gain ground. The essence of their efforts 
is that they are ready to give up not only the independence and 
political legality of the VMDK but also Hungarian autonomy in 
exchange for Serbian concessions adequate to their individual or 
group interests. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Mirjana Kusmuk] </F>
  [Text] The assembly of the Srpska republic has continued 
its session in Pale. SRNA journalist Mirjana Kusmuk reports: 
  [Kusmuk] The 39th session of the people's assembly of the 
Srpska republic continued in Pale at about 1100 this morning. 
After government ministers presented their reports, the deputies 
started to debate them behind closed doors. During the 15-minute 
break, the president of the Srpska republic [Radovan Karadzic] 
expressed a doubt in the replacement of the government, assuming 
that the assembly will decide to reshuffle it soon. The 
government will be made more dynamic and new posts will be 
created, those of deputies and assistants. The government will 
also be requested to work faster. This will have to produce 
results, Karadzic said. 
  The assembly of the Srpska republic should today send a 
letter to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali regarding the UN 
decision to send Turkish troops to the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to Karadzic, judging by the 
prevailing mood in the assembly, the aforementioned letter will 
also contain a statement that by adopting this decision the 
Security Council has assumed responsibility for yet another 
dangerous precedent in the case of the former Yugoslavia, and 
that this represented the most direct responsibility for the 
possible spread of the war. 
  Commenting on the platform for the continuation of the peace 
negotiations adopted yesterday, Karadzic stressed that the 
Serbian side would continue to negotiate with the Croats and the 
Muslims on some kind of links under certain conditions, but that 
it will not agree to the imposition of any solutions. 
  A doubt was expressed that the conditions existed for our 
entry in the Muslim-Croat federation. However, we have not 
received any official offer to join them, Karadzic said. 
  The assembly session is still in progress. The reports of 
the republican ministries are being discussed behind closed 
doors.

  [Excerpts] A two-day session of the main committee of the 
Party of Democratic Action [SDA] opened in Sarajevo today. In 
addition to the president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, 
Alija Izetbegovic, and presidency members, the session was 
attended by Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, government members, 
Reis-ul-Ulema Mustafa Efendija Ceric, our ambassadors in foreign 
countries, commanders of the Bosnia-Herzegovina army corps, and 
other eminent guests and members of the SDA's main committee. 
Alija Izetbegovic announced at the session that he was 
returning to lead the Party of Democratic Action. [passage 
omitted] 
  At the extended session of the SDA's main committee, which 
is 
some kind of convention, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic spoke 
about another important topic: Bosnia-Herzegovina today and 
tomorrow and Bosniak Muslims in it. 
  [Begin Silajdzic recording] I would like to stress that the 
[Washington] agreement is not the result only of the 
negotiations held in the past two months in Frankfurt, Vienna, 
and Washington, but primarily of the readiness of our people to 
persist on the path which demands great sacrifices -- that is it 
is a result of the sacrifices of our people -- of the army's 
readiness to respond to the aggression successfully, and, of 
course, of the principled policy implemented by the state 
leaders throughout that period, including intensive diplomatic 
activity, which was, for understandable reasons, not always 
publicly announced. 
  I would like to stress that the agreement does not suspend, 
and does not even bring into the question, the existing 
international and legal status of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina within its internationally recognized 
borders. The adoption of the constitution of the federation, 
which was drafted as part of the (?conclusive) agreements, will 
have no impact on this. The Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
remains -- as an internationally recognized state -- the only 
legal and legitimate entity in the peace process on this area. 
  Of course, if the so-called Serb side joins the agreement, 
the federation will be established throughout the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and its international status will be 
indisputable because this is an internal transformation of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. If the Serb side does not 
accept the agreement, the process of searching for a peaceful 
solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina will continue, and in that 
process the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its bodies retain 
the status which they have had so far. 
  Consequently, the establishment of the federation in the 
areas inhabited by a majority Bosniak and Croat population does 
not automatically mean that the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
ceases to exist. I am stressing this because many people 
wondered whether the establishment of the federation abolishes 
the international status of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [end recording] 
  At the end of the lengthy explanation of the Washington 
agreement, Silajdzic talked about a number of important goals to 
which this document will open the way for the Bosniak people. 
  [Begin Silajdzic recording] First, the agreement means the 
defeat of the strategy of Serb aggressors who counted on a split 
between Bosniaks and Croats, and who benefited most from the 
conflict. 
  The agreement also means the defeat of the exponents of 
extreme Croat nationalism, i.e., the victory of those political 
forces among the Croatian people who realized that the conflict 
was detrimental to the interests of both Croats and Bosniaks. 
  Third, by overcoming the conflict and reaching an agreement, 
we have struck a very important strategic balance which 
considerably restricts the activities of aggressive Serb 
nationalism, turning it into a [word indistinct] political 
project without a future. 
  Fourth, the agreement is an important step toward removing 
the consequences of ethnic cleansing. It creates legal and 
political prerequisites for the return of all refugees in the 
territory of the federation and the implementation of this 
agreement will create realistic conditions for this to be 
achieved. 
  Fifth, the agreement is also important from the point of 
view 
of prospects for the fastest possible return of refugees and 
this is exceptionally important for Bosniaks. 
  Sixth, the constitutional principles contained in the 
agreement and decisions in principle regarding the political and 
territorial organization of the federation do not allow for the 
fragmentation of natural and economic entities which is of 
far-reaching economic and political importance. 
  Eighth [as heard], the agreement contains solutions which 
allow for the effective and economically purposeful exploitation 
of major natural resources, not restricting them within a narrow 
regional framework. 
  Ninth, the access to the sea is being resolved in a way 
which 
is acceptable to both sides, which is of vital importance for us. 
  Tenth, the agreement considerably strengthens our position 
in 
a future peace process, i.e., it strengthens our ability to 
later resolve the issue of the occupied territories, as well as 
the issue of the Bosniaks living outside the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Eleventh, the agreement above all means the reaffirmation of 
a positive attitude toward the Bosniaks and it means accepting 
the Bosniaks as a nation which belongs to the European community 
of nations and which has its place in global relations. 
  Twelfth, taken as a whole, the agreement opens up realistic 
prospects for the survival and development of the Bosniak 
people, instead of the destruction and extermination which had 
been intended for us. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] [Announcer] A two-day session of the main committee 
of the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] opened in Sarajevo. In 
addition to the president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, 
Alija Izetbegovic, the session is being attended by 
representatives of the highest state bodies and political, 
religious, and military life of the city and the state. 
  In a report on the work of the SDA so far, Party Chairman 
Mirsad Ceman gave a brief summary of the activity of the SDA, 
one of the rare organizations which was prepared for the 
aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina and which contributed 
fully -- in political, military, and all other spheres -- to the 
defense of our homeland and the Bosniak Muslim nation whose 
political interests it represents. The SDA has fully responded 
to the historic challenge and it therefore represents a strong 
political basis and a guarantee for the survival and freedom of 
the Bosniak Muslims. 
  Speaking about Bosnia, President Izetbegovic said that good 
and evil, reason and madness came into conflict here. 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] I have noticed over the past 
two years of this war that the world has slowly divided into 
those who are for and those who are against Bosnia. There are 
almost no more neutral people. They have either been for or 
against Bosnia, and no one has remained uninvolved. 
  When you analyze that division, you can see that everything 
that was good, thank God, sided with us. I have noticed this 
speaking, for example, about governments in a country. Their 
sleek politicians placed themselves on the other side, but the 
free-thinking people in that country -- [word indistinct] all 
those idealists, romantics, poets, artists -- they were all on 
our side. The whole of the Muslim world was on our side, but 
that is a special case. Everything good in the Western world 
sided with us. [end recording] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Bosnia will be a country of law 
and order, Izetbegovic went on to say. At the same time, it 
will be governed in such a way that a genocide against Bosniak 
Muslims will never again occur. Despite the fact that they have 
lost most people for Bosnia's freedom, they will not give up the 
struggle to recover the captured territories. 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] Our people currently living in 
Germany or Croatia must be able to return to their villages near 
Zvornik. There is no negotiating there. There is no 
negotiating there. [applause] That is a practical, everyday, 
political reason. There is also a moral reason. Could we 
possibly give them [Serbs] those territories as a reward for 
(?their job) of having killed us -- please keep it as a reward. 
We will not allow that. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] As part of the second item of the agenda, 
which has not started yet, following a report by Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic on the recently signed agreement with the 
Croats, seven more reports will be submitted: on the functioning 
of state bodies, foreign policy, information, refugees, army, 
veterans' issues, and economic reconstruction of the country.

  [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, addressed today's session of the 
main committee of the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] with the 
following words: 
  In our assessment we should prevent the continuation of a 
war 
waged on two fronts, which is suffocating us. We have reached 
the conclusion that one front has to be extinguished, and that 
it would be better and less painful if it were done with the 
Croats. True, our wounds are still fresh from the conflict with 
them, but they are nonetheless lighter than the ones inflicted 
on us by the Serbs. 
  It is also important to say that the chetniks' loathsome 
project had the support of their academicians and the church, 
which is not the case with the Croatian policy. The Croats did 
not have the backing of either the church or of a large number 
of people in Croatia. Fewer people in Croatia have messed 
things up, Izetbegovic said.

  [Text] In Mostar today the chamber of deputies of the Croat 
republic of Herceg-Bosna is discussing the course and results of 
the Croat-Bosnian Muslim talks in Washington, Vienna, and Split. 
It is coordinating the positions the representatives of the 
Croat people will be advocating at the constituent assembly in 
Sarajevo on Monday [28 March]. Zdenko Vranjes has the report. 
  [Vranjes] If we wish to be realistic we will conclude that 
the solutions agreed and signed in Washington serve the 
interests of the entire Croat nation, the interests of the Croat 
people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the interests of the Republic 
of Croatia, said Kresimir Zubak, president of the Presidential 
Council of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, speaking in 
detail about the course and results of the talks. The Croats 
have attained a high degree of unity in signing the Washington 
accord; we see the agreement as binding, and we are ready to 
translate what we have signed into practice, Zubak said. He 
called on the deputies to adopt the constitution at the assembly 
in Sarajevo. 
  If we manage to elect experts and capable people to 
responsible posts in the municipalities, grand counties 
[velezupe], and the federation, then Bosnia-Herzegovina, with 
constitutional guarantees, will remain a homeland of the Croat 
people in the future, Zubak said. He added that by accepting 
the Washington accord, a turnabout was made by those who called 
for a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina and not those who suggested 
from the very beginning that Bosnia-Herzegovina be a federal 
state in which the Croat people would be equal and 
state-building. 
  Zubak also said in his opening address that the solutions 
from Washington were not imposed ones but that it was obvious 
that it would have been extremely unfavorable for the Croat 
people if the agreement had not been signed. 
  Before the debate the deputies were informed about the 
positions taken by the Presidency of the HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Union] for Bosnia-Herzegovina, positions that were 
adopted by the HDZ parliamentary group prior to the session of 
the chamber. The HDZ extended full support to the documents 
signed and called on the HDZ deputies to persevere in the 
adoption of the draft constitution and the election of the 
federation's president and vice president in the interim period 
at the assembly in Sarajevo. In view of the fact that the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina president, in his extended term in office, 
came from the ranks of the Bosnian Muslim people, the HDZ 
presidency insists that the federation's Presidency in the 
interim period be a Croat and that the interim government's 
prime minister be a Muslim. The HDZ proposes that the 
constituent assembly elect Kresimir Zubak president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. 
  The HDZ Presidency also charged all the bodies of authority 
in Herceg-Bosna with the task of creating conditions for the 
implementation of the agreement and to strengthen functions and 
institutions which, in conformity with the constitution, are to 
remain intact until a final and overall decision on the fate of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is reached. The deputies were also informed 
that the Croat deputies at the constituent assembly in Sarajevo 
will be headed by Ivan Bender, assembly deputy and president of 
the Chamber of Deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, 
and that Ivo Zivkovic has been appointed as his deputy. This 
proposal was adopted by the HDZ parliamentary group at this 
morning's session. A debate on this subject is under way and 
this part of the session of the Chamber of Deputies is off 
limits to reporters. 
  The agenda of the chamber of deputies of the Croat republic 
of Herceg-Bosna also includes several important draft laws -- 
the laws on defense, internal affairs, refugees, and displaced 
persons, and health care. 
  The session is also attended by guests from the Republic of 
Croatia, HDZ officials Ivan Milas and Gojko Susak.

  [Excerpts] We begin the news with a report from the session 
of the chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna, held in Mostar: 
  Today, in a warm and quiet Mostar, the Chamber of Deputies 
of 
the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna approved the constitution of 
the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and tasked the Croat 
deputies -- members of the constituent assembly [of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina] -- with approving the constitution at the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly session in Sarajevo on 28 March. 
[passage omitted] 
  Following the opening speeches, the discussions were held 
behind closed doors. A committee for monitoring the discussion 
this evening proposed the following conclusions: To form a 
delegation of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, comprising 
Kresimir Zubak, Jadranko Prlic and General Ante Roso, which will 
attend the work of the constitutent assembly in Sarajevo on 
Monday, in addition to the deputies. A body for conducting 
political talks with the Muslim side on all issues is also to be 
formed, and will include Kresimir Zubak, Ivo Zivkovic, Perica 
Jukic, and Ivica Lucic. 
  In addition to these items, the agenda of the Chamber of 
Deputies includes several draft laws. Discussion is under way.

  [Text] Army General Rasim Delic, chief of general staff of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, and Colonel General Ante Roso, 
chief of general staff of the Croat Defense Council [HVO], 
signed an agreement in Sarajevo today on the organization of the 
joint command of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO. The 
agreement defines the organization and tasks of the joint 
commands in the interim period, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 
press center reports. It was agreed that joint commands in 
sectors and military districts should become operational as soon 
as possible. According to the agreement the organization of the 
federal army, i.e., the army of the federation, will follow 
immediately after the proclamation of the federal constitution.

  [Text] We have just learned that late this afternoon Alija 
Izetbegovic, the president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, 
received Charles Redman, U.S. President Clinton's special envoy. 
They held talks for almost two hours. Nedzad Leko has a report. 
  [Leko] Following the talks with Charles Redman, President 
Izetbegovic told journalists the following: 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] As you can see, you waited for 
a long time. We had rather long talks. This was one in a 
series of talks on peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, on restoring 
peace. This is a kind of search for solution to the problem in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Of course, we touched on the unavoidable question of 
territories. We also mentioned the problem of Sarajevo and 
Mostar. We agreed that, as far as Sarajevo and Mostar are 
concerned, we will proceed with the planned solution, that is, 
the administration of Sarajevo by the United Nations and of 
Mostar by the European Community. I think that we will stick to 
these solutions. (?Representatives of the EC) have already 
visited Mostar and I believe that Mostar representatives will go 
to Brussels as early as next week to resume talks. 
  We are, therefore, still searching for a peaceful solution 
in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and these talks are part of the efforts in 
that direction. I believe that they were very constructive and 
useful. [end recording] 
  [Leko] Speaking about the Bosnia-Herzegovina parliament 
session tomorrow and the Assembly of Citizens of Serb 
Nationality in Sarajevo today, Charles Redman said: 
  [Begin Redman recording, in English fading into 
Serbo-Croatian translation] All of these meetings are very 
important. They demonstrate that the political leadership in 
Bosnia is actively involved in the search for a solution for the 
future. As the president said, there are many issues on our 
agenda. Many of those things refer to a short-term improvement 
in living conditions, the improvement of the situation in 
Sarajevo, Mostar, and other areas in Bosnia, but we all know 
that we have (?an important task), which is to try to find a 
comprehensive solution to this war through talks. That is a very 
difficult issue. (?The president) has been dealing with it for 
months. I know that the Bosnian Government is permanently 
committed to this aim, and I believe that the Bosnian Croats are 
also interested in that, as we can see from the agreement on the 
federation which will be discussed tomorrow at the [Bosnian] 
parliament session. I hope that there is the same type of 
constructive standpoint among the Bosnian Serbs. 
  It is only through a joint action by all three sides that we 
will reach an effective and acceptable solution. These meetings 
are an important part of that process. I have heard a lot of 
encouraging statements at today's meeting of Citizens of Serb 
Nationality, and I hope that the session of the Bosnian 
parliament tomorrow will be equally encouraging. [end recording] 
  [Leko] Asked about the decision of the self-proclaimed 
parliament in Pale to refuse to join the Bosniak-Croat 
Federation, and whether he considered that decision final, 
Charles Redman said: 
  [Begin Redman recording] I do not know whether that is the 
final decision. We have known since the meeting in Geneva last 
August that the Bosnian Serbs wanted a high degree of autonomy. 
That led to the idea of a constitutional union which will 
preserve Bosnia-Herzegovina, but which will give its constituent 
parts a high degree of autonomy [words indistinct]. I have not 
heard anything from any side here in Bosnia that indicates that 
they want something else. So, while the Serbs perhaps do not 
want to become member of the federation in the same way that the 
Bosnian Croats and the Bosnian Government organized themselves, 
I heard nothing that indicates that they would not be interested 
in the idea of a constitutional union which preserves Bosnia.

  [Text] President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency 
Alija Izetbegovic received in Sarajevo today the delegation of 
the Croatian Parliament headed by Parliament Chairman Stipe 
Mesic. In the course of the meeting, Izetbegovic and Mesic 
spent a long time discussing the most topical issues concerning 
relations between the two countries. 
  The Croatian delegation -- currently visiting Sarajevo on 
the 
invitation of Assembly Chairman Miro Lazovic, and for the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly session -- comprises representatives 
of several parliamentary parties. In addition to Stipe Mesic, 
Damir Zoric, deputy chairman of the Croatian Parliament's House 
of Districts [Zupanijski dom], and deputies in the Croatian 
Parliament's House of Representatives [Zastupnicki dom] Muhamed 
Zulic, Pavao Tomislav Duka, and Josip Pankretic are present. 
  After the meeting and talks in the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency, Stipe Mesic, chairman of the Croatian Parliament, 
and Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency, gave the following statements to the many domestic 
and foreign correspondents. 
  [Begin Mesic recording] The Croatian delegation -- or to put 
it more precisely -- the delegation of the Croatian Parliament 
has come to attend the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly session. We 
come as friends. This is a historical moment which reflects the 
survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the only guarantee of peace 
in Europe and the world. The world is returning to its 
principles -- the principles of the inviolability of borders -- 
and this moment and the events in the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Assembly are effective confirmation of these principles. If the 
borders were to be changed by force, new aggressors would appear 
tomorrow. Why should the Serbs alone have the privilege of 
living in one state and in the name of this be allowed to take 
other peoples' territories? There would be others who would 
demand this privilege, and then the world would no longer stand 
a chance. Therefore, the return to these principles is a 
guarantee of peace, and I believe that we are now much closer to 
peace than we were earlier because the world has realized that 
this is no longer about Bosniak Muslims, Croats, or Serbs. This 
is about European and world peace. That is why they are now 
solving this as their problem and not our problem. [end 
recording] 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] [Words indistinct] Mr. Mesic 
who is well-known as a friend of Bosnia-Herzegovina, [words 
indistinct]. I remember him from our meetings in Belgrade, 
where he always came up with a constructive position regarding 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. We, of course, discussed relations between 
Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the essential thing I can 
accentuate is [word indistinct] that the maintenance of a 
unitary Bosnia- Herzegovina is not only in the interest of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina but also in Croatia's interest. Mr. Mesic 
(?wholeheartedly) confirmed this in the course of our 
discussion. Of course, the talks will continue with the 
delegation of the (?Croatian) Parliament. We were very glad to 
see that the Croatian delegation is a multiparty delegation. 
(?We have) the representatives of (?three) parties here. 
[Words indistinct] and we talked about opening a Croatian 
embassy here in Sarajevo. [end recording]

to Bosnia-Herzegovina, about the current situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the relations between the two countries.

Izetbegovic made the following statements: 
  [Asayesh-Zarebi, in Persian with superimposed Serbo-Croatian 
translation] "We had very useful talks with President 
Izetbegovic. We are hoping that the initiated peace talks will 
bring peace. The Islamic Republic of Iran is pleased with the 
newly developing situation, [words indistinct] why it had not 
been done earlier. The negotiations that were conducted between 
Muslims, Croats, and Serbs should end with real peace. We are 
hoping that the borders are not going to be changed. We would 
like to thank the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government and the 
presidency since they are trying hard to [word indistinct] 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as little as possible." 
  [Izetbegovic] ``I had talks with Iranian Ambassador Mohammad 
Javad Asayesh-Zarebi; first of all, I informed him about the 
last round our of negotiations, about the Washington agreement. 
I am pleased to have concluded that Iran also supports our 
efforts to that effect, which is a path toward the restoration 
of peace here. We also examined what Iran can do in that 
direction in the light of its good relations with Russia. 
  "We also discussed a number of issues directly in connection 
with Bosnia-Herzegovina and Iran. I thanked Iran, the Iranian 
Government, and the people for their support and aid that they 
have been giving to our country [words indistinct]. In that 
regard Iran right from the outset [passage indistinct]."

  [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, held a meeting in Sarajevo today 
with the top military leadership and the top representatives of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs led by Army General Delic and 
Interior Minister Alispahic. The meeting was also attended by 
General Enver Hadzihasanovic, Bosnia-Herzegovina Army chief of 
staff brigadier, corps commanders of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army, and the commander of special units of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs. 
  The following issues of importance for further development 
of 
the armed forces of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina were 
examined at the meeting:

of 
the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina in line with the Washington 
agreement and military agreements signed in Split, Zagreb, and 
Sarajevo; 
  -- Material support for the development of the armed forces

Ministry of Internal Affairs gave their full support to Alija 
Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, in 
his further political activities aimed at the founding of the

  Other current issues were discussed at the meeting, on which 
the General Staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs expressed the same views.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 27 Mar (TANJUG) -- "We cannot claim what 
is not ours, but on the other hand, no one can take away from us 
what our ancestors created and what has been given to us to 
preserve and cherish," Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the 
Srpska republic parliament, said today at a formal session of 
the Srpska assembly of Novo Sarajevo municipality. He added 
that, as a city, Serb Sarajevo was built on Serb areas and that 
Serbs have a right to it. 
  Thanking everyone who helped Serb Sarajevo preserve freedom 
and remain Serb, Krajisnik stressed that the struggle is not 
over yet, and that Serb enemies are still claiming the right to 
that part of the Serb ethnic territory. Krajisnik repeated that 
Serbs will not enter any kind of federation with Croats and 
Muslims, and that they will decide where and with whom to live 
on the basis of their right to self-determination. "We allow 
others to do everything we want to do, and if we are to be 
blamed for that, then we are guilty," Krajisnik said. 
  "Great pressure will be exerted on us to make further 
concessions. We can negotiate and find a compromise solution, 
but only so far as this will not threaten the minimum of our 
national interests. We cannot go below that, and we do not have 
the right to do that," Krajisnik said. 
  The deputies in the Srpska assembly of the Novo Sarajevo 
municipality and guests at today's formal session paid tribute 
to more than 1,200 victims -- half of whom were civilians -- who 
have fallen in defense of that part of Serb Sarajevo.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 25 Mar (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the people's assembly of the Srpska republic, this 
evening sent a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, 
stressing that "a year ago the Srpska republic assembly passed a 
decision that no foreign army can enter its territory without 
the parliament's permission." 
  "Sending a Turkish military contingent to Bosnia would set a 
precedent which the Security Council should not accept, and 
should certainly not be the one to set it, because Turkey has 
failed to keep the necessary neutrality during the civil war in 
Bosnia, and it even openly sided with the Muslim side. In 
addition, Turkey is a country whose centuries-long 
occupation-style rule of this region is still alive in the 
memory of the Serb nation," the letter stresses. 
  Deputies of the Srpska republic's people's assembly believe, 
it is stated, that this decision is morally and humanly 
impermissible, and that it would be counterproductive for the 
peace process. 
  "The Srpska republic assembly charged me with warning you of 
fatal consequences of that action," Krajisnik stresses in his 
letter.

  [Text] Banja Luka, 27 Mar (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, said at a meeting today with 
the Banja Luka municipal committee of the Serb Democratic Party 
[SDS] that the Muslims' large-scale spring offensive, which has 
already begun, must be halted. 
  "If they (the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army) do not stop 
the offensive, I will order a counteroffensive and they will not 
be able to obtain the territories they could obtain through 
political negotiations," Karadzic said. He added: "There is no 
way they can get the territories where they are now killing our 
people." 
  Karadzic believes the international community will soon 
exert 
more pressure to stop the war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [By Michel Viatteau] </F>
  [Text] Maglaj, Bosnia-Herzegovina, March 26 (AFP) -- 
Bosnian Croats have severed their ties with their erstwhile Serb 
allies, with whom they had until recently been besieging the 
Moslem-held northern Bosnian town of Maglaj, a British UN 
officer said here Saturday. 
  Following the signing of the Croat-Moslem federation 
agreement in Washington March 18, the Croats had "found a means 
to convince" the Serb forces around Maglaj to leave, Major 
Richard Margesson, commander of British UN troops in Maglaj, 
said. 
  In Zepce, 18 kilometres (12 miles) south of Maglaj, a 
resident, who requested anonymity, said the Croat forces had 
simply paid off the Serbs, although it was not known if it was 
payment in kind or cash. 
  Margesson said that in the summer of 1993 the Croats in 
Zepce 
had feared they would not be able to repulse Bosnian army 
offensives coming from Zenica, Zavidovici and Maglaj. They "made 
an agreement" with the local Serb forces, who sent them several 
hundred soldiers in return for food, the chance to evacuate 
their sick and wounded, some military material and also cash, he 
said. 
  The Serb lines are still clearly visible 600 metres (yards) 
from the town centre, up on a hillside overlooking the city. 
From time to time, shots ring out, though not as frequently as 
before. On Friday, when a sniper targetted a British UN patrol, 
the UN shot back with 30-mm cannon fire, curtailing, at least 
for a while, further attacks. Since last Monday, the office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has brought 
humanitarian aid convoys into the town and public soup kitchens, 
operating for the past two years, have started to wind down 
their aid operations as more people are able to cook for 
themselves at home. Rocket and mortar fire, which mark the walls 
of every building, only stopped 10 days ago. But despite the 
haunted looks in most people's eyes, the grim expressions, the 
lack of smiles, it seems as if the city is starting to breath 
again. Daniel de Schryver, head of mission for the Medecins sans 
Frontieres (Doctors without Borders) aid group, said the arrival 
of aid in the town had acted as a tremendous psychological boost.

<F P=106> [Pool report] </F>
  [Text] Bileca, March 26 (TANJUG) -- Members of the Bosnian 
Croat Army on Saturday continued attacks on Moslem-controlled 
parts of Mostar using grenade launchers and rifles with 
telescopic sights, Moslem radio said, quoting a statement by the 
information service of the fourth Bosnian Moslem army corps. 
  Croat-Moslem conflicts in the south of the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and in its central parts continue 
despite the agreement signed by representatives of these two 
peoples to form a federal state in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was 
signed in Washington on March 18, under strong pressure from the 
United States. Members of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) on 
Saturday morning set fire to a nursery school in Mostar, said a 
Moslem army statement. Five civilians were wounded on Friday in 
mortar attacks by ustashi, as the Sarajevo Radio reporter called 
the local Croat troops. The command of the 4th corps of the 
so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Army (the Bosnian Moslem army) has 
rejected explanations by Croats that some 'extremist elements of 
the HVO' are violating the truce. Moslem units in the fronts in 
the wider region of Serb-controlled Doboj in northeastern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, continued offensive actions, this time 
against both Serb defence positions and villages, the 
information service of the First Krajina Corps of the Bosnian 
Serb army said on Saturday Morning. Bosnian Serb troops on 
Saturday managed to repulse an infantry attack by the Moslems 
northeast of Serb-controlled Teslic in northern Bosnia. An 
attempt by a Moslem subversive-terrorist group to penetrate deep 
into Serb territory in this part of the Teslic front was 
successfully thwarted, and two Moslem infantry attacks on the 
southern and southeastern sectors of the Trebava front were 
repulsed. Moslem forces on Saturday also launched mortar attacks 
against Serb villages on the right bank of the river Bosna. 
  Strong Moslem attacks using mortars, anti-aircraft and 
infantry weaponry were recorded in the night between Friday and 
Saturday from their positions some 20km northwest of Zvornik, a 
town in northeastern Bosnia which is on the border with the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Bosnian Serb troops returned 
strong fire to protect their positions. There were no casualties 
on the Serb side, the sources said. Moslems attacked Serb 
positions in the area of Konjic, Foca and Cajnice (southeastern 
Bosnia) with infantry and anti-aircraft weaponry from the wider 
region of Gorazde, the information service of the Herzegovina 
Corps said on Saturday.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 28 March within its 
regular seven-minute newscast carries several reports on the 
situation in the republic. 
  Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac that ``the (?Serbian) 
aggressor continued to attack the front lines of the Bihac 
region last night and this morning. A particular [word 
indistinct] is on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Height -- that is, the 
Hasin Vrh -- where they attempted new infantry breakthroughs, 
which our defenders managed to reject. Artillery and 
antiaircraft weapon activity is incessant on the Bihac, Bosanska 
Krupa, and (Budzin) sections of the front. Sniper activity has 
become more intensive since this morning and chetnik regroupings 
have been observed. 
  "There is no peace on the lines of separation with the 
paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa autonomy. In 
the Cazin regions of Krivaja, Crnac, and Liskovac, they were 
[word indistinct] with mortar and mountain guns and provoking 
infantry clashes all the time." The 3d Corps Press Center 
reports the ``more frequent defeats on the battlefield were a 
reason for the chetnik artillery to retaliate on the defense 
lines and civilian targets. This time they recorded a defeat on 
(Terijsko) battlefield, where fighters of the Bosnian Army 
repressed them by 1 kilometer at Debelo Brdo. Mortar bombs of 
82 and 120 mm fell on Zeljezno Polje and the defense lines. An 
enemy recoilless gun and a Bofors gun were used to pound defense 
lines. The only consequence was material damage. Chetniks were 
frequently hitting civilian targets in Krusac: five shells were 
launched from (Bornici) and inflicted new damages on buildings. 
Two shells launched from Kalinovac fell on Travnik yesterday 
afternoon but fortunately had no consequences.'' 
  Hamiz Deronjic reports that "the situation on the Brcko 
battlefield was somewhat calmer compared to the past several 
days. At the moment, the Serbian aggressor has resorted to 
artillery operations from a safe distance, which are regularly 
accompanied by antiaircraft and antiarmor weapons with intensive 
work by chetnik snipers. Last night, enemy 60- and 82-mm 
mortars were most active from the direction of Sekulici, Stari 
Brod, and Cadjevac and were pounding Brcko defense lines on 
Djukici, Kladje, at the Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca line, and the 
central battlefield section. Air space in the Bijeljina, Brcko, 
and Pelagicevo is still the most used for enemy aircraft. At 
2000 last night, Serbian transport helicopters were flying 
overhead." 
  Amira Salibasic reports that "the free Olovo territory was 
the target of occasional artillery attacks yesterday. The 
morning passed with provocative enemy attacks from (?infantry) 
weapons, while in the evening, the aggressor intensified his 
attacks by using long-range arms."

  [Text] A convoy of the U.S. humanitarian organization (CRS) 
was stopped today along one of the recently opened blue roads 
from Visoko to Sarajevo at a control point of the Serbian 
aggressor's side near Ilijas. The reason the convoy was 
stopped, according to the announcement by the Information 
Ministry, was the demand by the Serbian side to be given 30 
percent of the goods from the convoy as a toll for passing 
through the territory under its control. 
  Such a gesture by the Serbian side at a time when the 
international community is exerting new efforts to find a 
peaceful solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina not only shows that 
these efforts are being ignored but that the aggressor has no 
intention of renouncing its blackmailing methods. By making it 
impossible for a convoy to pass through, one threatens the 
freedom and rights established by the agreement on opening blue 
corridors and thereby the basic principles of international 
humanitarian rights, it is said, among other things, in the 
information issued by the Information Ministry of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] [Word indistinct] enemy air force, despite the 
resolutions of the UN Security Council, is constantly using the 
air corridors above temporarily occupied Brcko [words 
indistinct] chetnik pilots. At 1830 last night a Serbian 
helicopter that was flying on the Bjeljina-Pelagicevo route 
approached our positions and this [words indistinct] fire was 
opened. [Words indistinct] seriously damaged it was forced to 
land in temporarily occupied Brcko. 
  The demonstration of power of the enemy artillery on the 
Brcko plain in the absence of any attempts of infantry 
breakthroughs over the last few days reveals another chronic 
problem of the aggressor -- lack of manpower and low morale. 
According to our reliable sources, the chetnik soldiers on 
temporarily occupied Brcko territory, who have long been 
refusing to go to the front lines or into attacks, are now 
demanding that their commanders walk in front of them, because 
their commanders, infected with a feverish desire for military 
rank and prestige, have been marching them across minefields to 
satisfy their own ambitions.

  [Text] Srbobran, 25 Mar (TANJUG) -- The command of the 
Srpska republic army has vehemently denied UNPROFOR's [UN 
Protection Forces] report, made public in Zagreb today, 
according to which the mortar shell that landed this morning on 
the base belonging to UNPROFOR's British battalion in Bugojno 
had been fired from Serb positions. The command asserts that the 
Srpska republic army did not respond when Muslim forces this 
morning shelled Srbobran from positions in the direction of 
Bugojno, which is 12 km away. In reaction to UNPROFOR's report 
on the wounding of two British soldiers in Bugojno, Serb 
military sources in Srbobran claim that this was a result of the 
inter-Muslim fighting that has been going on in Bugojno over the 
past few days.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 25 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs 
authorities returned to the UN nine aid trucks hijacked two days 
ago by their troops near Maglaj, northern Bosnia, a spokesman 
for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said Friday 
[25 March]. The UNHCR said earlier it expected the trucks to be 
driven back to Banja Luka, northern Bosnia, by Bosnian Serb 
soldiers. 
  On Wednesday [23 March], around 100 Serb soldiers stole the 
trucks as they approached Maglaj carrying 94 tonnes of 
foodstuffs and medicines destined for the town's beleagured 
population. A 10th truck, stolen with the others, was found 
shortly afterwards and returned to UNHCR control. The trucks had 
been hijacked in the town of Teslic, next to Maglaj, and their 
10 Danish drivers terrorized before they were released. UN 
officials said at one point the Danish drivers had been lined up 
against a wall for what they feared was execution. The drivers 
were taken by truck to a Serb-Croat front line, from where they 
had to walk to a Bosnian Croat army post whose soldiers 
transferred them to a British UN base. 
  Aid convoys started reaching Maglaj last Sunday [20 March] 
after a five-month seige by Bosnian Serb forces. In October two 
Danish drivers of a UNHCR convoy were shot and killed as they 
entered Maglaj. UN Special Representative to the Former 
Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi protested to the authorities in Pale, 
the Bosnian Serb stronghold, after the convoy was taken. Radovan 
Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said the colonel in charge of 
the soldiers had been stripped of his command, adding that an 
inquiry had been launched.

  [Text] Zvornik, Bratunac, 28 Mar (TANJUG) -- Regular forces 
of the Croatian Army, units of the Croatian Defense Council 
[HVO], and formations of the so-called Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have begun an all-out offensive against 
Serbian settlements and Serbian defense lines in Posavina, 
TANJUG's correspondent has learned from Serbian military sources 
in the Srpska republic. The VRS [Army of the Srpska republic] 
sources say that in practice this is not just a continuation of 
the war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, but that the war is 
spreading. The VRS warns that it will resolutely oppose all 
attacks and defend the territory of the Srpska republic, as well 
as the historic interests and rights of the Serbian people. The 
Serbian side has recently obtained information that preparations 
for the Muslim offensive -- the aim of which is to break through 
to the left bank of the Drina -- have entered their final stage. 
The VRS earlier obtained Muslim plans which in essence envisage 
the idea of a frontal attack on Podrinje from several 
directions. Particularly important in these offensives is the 
attempt by Muslim units to link up with the Raska district and 
further with Kosovo and Metohija. At the same time, the Serbian 
military sources say, the Muslims are planning to link together 
the Muslim enclaves in Podrinje and join them by land with the 
Tuzla area. Continuous efforts on the part of the Serbian side 
to achieve peace in former Bosnia-Herzegovina by political and 
not by military means give the best explanation and also shows 
for whom the only option is war, VRS sources say.

  [Excerpt] Ferocious fighting is in progress along the 
Tesanj-Teslic front lines and in a wide area around Crni Vrh. 
Joint units of the Seven-South operational zone are liberating 
the hitherto occupied territories of the Teslic municipality and 
linking up with the units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's 3d 
Corps in a triumphant operation. Hajrudin Reidzovic reports: 
  At the time of this report strategic front lines were pushed 
forward by the capture of a piece of territory 6 km long and 
1.5-2 km deep. Important facilities [objekti], which have 
served as the most important strongholds of the Serb aggressors 
since the beginning of the war, have been captured: Kuzno 
Groblje PT 675, Vis Plane PT 677, hill 655, Tresnjev Panj and 
[name indistinct], name] or hill 497. [sentence as heard] Husar 
and Omerovo Guvno, notorious chetnik strongholds for the past 22 
months, from which they have killed civilians, especially 
children, are also about to fall. 
  At this moment our units are advancing relentlessly toward 
the south and the southwest. This is the collapse of the 
strategy of war criminal General Mladic. The number of dead 
aggressor soldiers exceeds 50, and twice as many have been 
injured and thus taken out of action. A substantial amount of 
arms and ammunition and military equipment has been seized.

  [Text] Banja Luka, 26 Mar (TANJUG) -- Two unidentified 
aircraft bombed positions of the army of the Srpska republic 
today, near Velika Suljaga, 15 km northeast of Kupres, Serb 
military sources report. After the air attack, members of the 
so-called army of Bosnia-Herzegovina carried out -- from the 
direction of Bugojno, or rather Mala Suljaga and Glavica -- a 
powerful artillery attack. In the Prusac region, from where 
artillery has been in action daily against Kupres and Srbobran, 
an intensive regrouping of units of the so-called army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has been observed.

Moslem units have been launching severe offensives against Serb 
defence positions and settlements on all fronts in the wider 
area of Doboj, Bosnian Serb Army sources said. 
  The heaviest attacks were recorded on the Teslic front, 
where 
Moslem infantry troops attacked from several directions. 
Bosnian Serb troops managed to halt all attacks and forced the 
Moslems to retreat, the command of the First Krajina Corps said. 
  Moslem forces used infantry arms, anti-aircraft guns and 
grenade launchers to attack Serb positions in the north-eastern 
part of the Teslic battlefield. They attacked villages and the 
town of Teslic with mortars. One civilian was wounded in a 
shell explosion in Jasenica, and three civilians were wounded in 
Teslic. Early in the morning on Sunday, Moslem units used 
mortars to attack Serb positions surrounding the villages of 
Lukici and Sekulici, eight kilometers to the west of Brcko in 
northern Bosnia, Banja Luka Army sources said.

  [Excerpts] A convention of citizens of Serb nationality 
ended in Sarajevo today with the adoption of a declaration 
expressing the firm will of the Serb people living in the free 
part of Bosnia-Herzegovina to live in peace in a single 
Bosnia-Herzegovina within its internationally recognized 
borders. [passage omitted] 
  In its declaration, the convention stresses that no 
political 
goals can justify the suffering of innocent population, genocide 
and ethnic cleansing, particularly suffered by the Bosniak 
people. It stresses that the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina lies 
in its independence and sovereignty within the internationally 
recognized borders. Both the declaration and the proclamation 
on the convocation of a convention of trust energetically urge 
the strictest punishment by the international tribunal of all 
war criminals. The convocation of the convention of trust 
itself is necessary because interethnic trust will not be 
restored easily and quickly, while the convention can contribute 
to this hard and painstaking process. [passage omitted] 
  Let us just add in conclusion that the convention of the 
citizens of Serb nationality ended with the election of the Serb 
Civic Forum [Srpski gradjanski forum]. Mirko Pejanovic was 
elected president of the 32-member forum.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Josip Manolic, "leader of the </F>
Croatian Upper House," by Karin Veraart; place and date not 
given: "`Tudjman Does Not Want To Implement Accord With Bosnia'"] 
  [Text] Josip Manolic (72), leader of the Croatian upper 
house, formed the governing Croatian party, the HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Union], together with present President Franjo 
Tudjman in 1990. Manolic, the former head of the intelligence 
service in communist Croatia, represents the moderates. 
Following the outbreak of fighting between Muslims and Croats 
in Bosnia in 1993, a split arose between Manolic and Tudjman. 
On Thursday, Manolic was ousted from the HDZ party leadership 
and the Central Committee. 
  "It is a coup," the elderly politician calmly states. "But 
it is not so much directed against me as against the Washington 
accord. Under strong pressure from the United States, Tudjman 
has signed the agreement for a confederation with Bosnia, but he 
has never for a moment planned to implement the accord." 
  Politicians from the moderate wing of the HDZ who support 
the 
accord also believe that Tudjman saw the removal of the 
influential Manolic as a way of being free to interpret the 
agreement as he thinks fit. Last Friday the Bosnian Croats, 
Bosnian Muslims, and Croatia agreed in Washington to form a 
federation in Bosnia, later to be enlarged into a confederation 
with Croatia. Tudjman was himself present at the ceremony, 
which he later described as a major step toward peace in the 
former Yugoslavia. 
  Manolic, an enthusiastic supporter of the confederation 
plans, went further. The day after the signing he called for 
the removal of Croatian Defense Minister Susak. This hardliner 
from Herzegovina is the support and anchor of the Croatian hawks 
in Herzegovina who are trying to set up their own state in the 
southwest of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "This man," says Manolic, "is responsible for the senseless, 
cruel war between Croats and Muslims in Bosnia, it is he who 
implicated Croatia in this war by sending Croatian troops to the 
war zone, and he is responsible for the international 
community's threat to impose sanctions against Croatia due to 
this military involvement." 
  "Susak is so pleased with the Washington accord, so pleased 
that he wished it had never existed. If we want to seriously 
implement the accord, then Susak must go." 
  "But Tudjman does not want to get rid of Susak, and does not 
want any agreement. He is simply afraid of losing Western 
support for Croatia, of sanctions. As a gesture of goodwill to 
the international community he replaced the hawk Boban as leader 
of the Bosnian Croats by the more moderate Zubak." 
  "An empty gesture," says Manolic. "Zubak is no more than a 
stand in and the extremists all remain in their posts. Boban 
was simply the tip of the iceberg. But if you touch Susak the 
iceberg starts to wobble." The serene politician flared up: 
"Can you imagine that Susak in an interview with THE JERUSALEM 
POST, a Jewish newspaper, said the following: `My father was a 
ustasha, but not a fascist, he was a patriot.'" 
  "I knew that I risked coming under fire myself when I called 
for Susak to go. We had already made a bet on it," he cracks 
with smile for his adviser Zdenko Svete. Manolic, seated at the 
head of a large, highly polished table, exudes an air of 
serenity as he receives congratulations from excited members of 
Parliament for his tactical move at Friday morning's Senate 
session. 
  It had been the intention to move a motion of no confidence 
in the parliamentary leader at the beginning of the session, but 
the disorganized MP's missed their opportunity. This formally 
entitled Manolic to himself determine the time allowed for the 
vote, with the restriction that it must take place within 30 
days. He therefore still has some respite. At the time of this 
conversation the session has been suspended for one hour. "They 
are telephoning Tudjman," says Manolic with a grin. 
  Manolic was once a colleague and personal friend of the 
Croatian president. In early 1993 things started to go wrong. 
Then war broke out between the former allies in Bosnia, the 
Muslims and the Croats, and although Tudjman denied Zagreb's 
involvement in the war, Manolic knew better. But support for 
the "extremists in Herzegovina" was not the only stumbling block 
in their relationship, he now says. 
  "I have always openly criticized the judiciary system. The 
fact that we have only recently achieved independence, that a 
war is being waged within our borders, are not circumstances 
which can be used as excuses for the inefficiency of the legal 
system. We have our extremists in Croatia, and these also 
include people from the government, from the governing party." 
  "There is a mentality of grab what you can get, there is a 
lively black market trade, former public property is being 
plundered, houses burned, and human rights infringed. 
Opposition parties have no chance, the media is being strictly 
controlled by the government. Little is being done to stop any 
of this and I have repeatedly spoken out against it, but I do 
not believe that it has been reported in the media." 
  He therefore reckoned on the possibility that one day he 
would have to go. Tudjman is and remains the boss. "But the 
timing is bad," says Manolic. "He is shooting himself in the 
foot. Tudjman is now showing the outside world exactly what 
kind of authoritarian leader he is and how he is in fact opposed 
to the Washington accord. This is the kind of high-handed, 
undemocratic leader the West is having to deal with."

  [Text] Knin, 27 Mar (TANJUG) -- A delegation of the 
republic of Serb Krajina led by President Milan Martic had talks 
in Knin today with U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Croatia 
Peter Galbraith. 
  Following the talks the U.S. ambassador held a news 
conference, at which he said that the aim of his visit to Knin 
was to invite Krajina to join a peace process initiated by the 
signing of the Washington agreement and to reintegrate into 
Croatia so that it could join the building of a democratic 
society and avoid isolation. 
  As another reason for his visit to Knin, the ambassador 
mentioned the cease-fire because, as he said, the time for it 
has come. This is a path, as Galbraith explained, toward 
reintegration into the Western world, in the political, 
security, and economic sense, which leads to the building of a 
democratic society. However, that path and goal is inevitably 
leading the republic of Serb Krajina, through reintegration, 
into the Republic of Croatia, the U.S. ambassador said. He 
added that the first step in that process is a cease-fire, and 
then economic and other measures leading to reintegration into 
the Western world. 
  An alternative for the republic of Serb Krajina is 
isolation, 
the U.S. ambassador said. He recalled the U.S. stand that 
Krajina is a part of Croatia, provided that the people living in 
the UN-protected areas (a name for the territory of the republic 
of Serb Krajina) are granted full human rights and a 
considerable degree of autonomy. 
  The mentioned process of reintegration into the Western 
world 
has also been offered to the Bosnian Serbs through their 
relations with the Muslim-Croat federation, while such 
possibilities are open to Serbia and Montenegro as well, the 
U.S. ambassador said. Dwelling on the last round of cease-fire 
negotiations in Zagreb and their resumption on Tuesday, 
Galbraith expressed the hope that an agreement on the cessation 
of hostilities will be achieved in the light of the fact that 
both sides -- the Croatian and the Krajina sides -- have shown 
flexibility and readiness for a compromise. 
  President Martic described the talks with the U.S. 
ambassador 
as useful. He expressed Krajina's readiness for the restoration 
of peace. However, as regards the reintegration of Krajina into 
Croatia, Martic highlighted the well-known principle of the 
right of a nation to self-determination regardless of U.S. and 
Russian standpoints, which consider the republic of Serb Krajina 
part of Croatia. 
  Martic said that in this regard he proposed a referendum to 
be held in the republic of Serb Krajina and Croatia at which 
people would say whether they want to live together or not, but 
added he has no doubts about the negative outcome of such a 
referendum.

  [Text] [Koprivica] The United States is committed to the 
territorial and political integrity of all the parts of the 
former Yugoslavia, of course with full respect for the 
fundamental human and civil rights. This was stated in Knin 
today by Peter Galbraith, U.S. ambassador in Zagreb, after 
meeting Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serbian 
Krajina. 
  Assessing the talks with Ambassador Galbraith as very 
useful, 
and stressing that the Krajina Serbs are very interested in a 
peaceful solution to the conflict with Croatia -- but certainly 
not at Krajina's disadvantage -- President Milan Martic said: 
  [Martic] On our behalf, we expressed our flexibility when it 
comes to peace. However, we demand flexibility from the other 
side, from the Republic of Croatia. We are for peace, there is 
no doubt about that. However, when it comes to the 
reintegration -- we listened to the ambassador concerning the 
views of the United States and Russia, that the republic of 
Serbian Krajina has to reintegrate into the Republic of Croatia 
in a peaceful way. We presented our view, and the view of our 
people -- regardless of the views of the United States and 
Russia, and the Security Council with its unfavorable 
resolutions -- that the basic right has to be observed, the 
right to self-determination, which has to be above those views. 
  [Koprivica] It is interesting to note that -- during the 
talks with Martic and his associates, and later in front of the 
reporters -- the U.S. diplomat did not even hint at denying the 
existence of the republic of Serbian Krajina as a state, nor did 
he reject the right of the Serbian people to self-determination.

  [Text] Kragujevac, 27 Mar (TANJUG) -- As the talks between 
the delegations of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] and the 
Republic of Croatia are about to resume in the Russian Embassy 
in Zagreb on 29 March, RSK Foreign Minister Slobodan Jarcevic 
said that the talks will pick up where they have stopped, but 
added that the Serb side will raise the issue of "organized 
state terror against Serbs in the Republic of Croatia." 
  Taking part in the Pecat Vremena program on Kragujevac 
Radio, 
Jarcevic said that the Serbian Council nongovernmental 
organization has established that 14,000 Serbs have been killed 
in Croatia by personnel of the Croatian Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. This fact speaks of the most serious form of state 
terror. 
  "The United Nations and the international community do not 
see or do not want to see what has been happening on 
three-quarters of the Croatian territory. As far as they are 
concerned the source of all evil in the past four years is 
one-quarter of the territory -- the RSK -- which clearly shows 
that the Serbian-Croatian conflict has not been approached in a 
just manner and that a just solution to the conflict between 
these two ethnic communities is being avoided." 
  Jarcevic said that the UN Security Council will be informed 
about Croatia's state terror against the Serbian people outside 
the RSK over the next few days. Asked to comment on the new U.S. 
plan and the Double K formula which conditions the solving of 
Krajina's autonomy to Kosovo's autonomy, Jarcevic said: 
  "That is yet another confirmation that people from developed 
countries do not understand our problems or are trying to 
realize their strategic goals in the Balkans with that move. No 
autonomy should be granted to Kosovo because it has been 
developing since 1945. The Albanians were granted all minority 
rights guaranteed and recognized in the world, but they did not 
want to exercise them; they wanted secession from the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia." "That situation cannot be compared with 
the situation in the RSK because it was the Serb people who 
created the AVNOJ [World War II government in Yugoslavia] in 
Croatia and who entered into an agreement with the Croatian 
ethnic community in 1944 for both nations to join their 
territories and create a single union in the federal Yugoslavia; 
it was stressed that the borders must not sever the link between 
all Serbs in Yugoslavia, as it was called in 1944 and 1945." [as 
received] 
  "We can cite many more examples which will not equate the 
problems of Kosovo-Metohija with those of the RSK and Croatia, 
but at the moment everyone is turning a deaf ear to those 
facts," Jarcevic said.

  [Text] Warsaw, 25 Mar--Following his Friday meeting with 
Waldemar Pawlak, Aleksander Kwasniewski told journalists that 
the coalition is maintaining Dariusz Rosati's candidacy to the 
post of deputy prime minister and finance minister. The prime 
minister believes his candidacy to be "professional, prepared, 
competent, and responsible" within this government, Kwasniewski 
said. 
  The president's objections connected to the FOZZ [Foreign 
Debt Servicing Fund] affair are not substantive, and they are 
meaningless when confronted with official reports received by 
the prime minister from the prosecutor general and the head of 
the State Protection Office, which state that "there are no 
grounds why Rosati should not hold the highest government 
posts," Kwasniewski said. 
  In his opinion, the president is once again "not showing 
proper interest in stabilizing the situation in the country." 
The argument that someone is working abroad and is involved 
there with the process of transforming the economies of West 
European countries just does not hold water, he added. 
  "Everything is now in the hands of the prime minister," said 
Kwasniewski. He also assured his audience that Rosati would not 
make any hasty decision. 
  Should the prime minister receive an official letter from 
the 
president, we will be dealing with a new situation, but this 
will be a situation between the coalition and the president, 
declared Kwasniewski.

  [Excerpts] Professor Lech Falandysz, deputy head of the 
Presidential Chancellery, has said in the "Puls Dnia" television 
program that, for President Lech Walesa, the matter of the 
candidacy of Dariusz Rosati for the post of deputy prime 
minister and minister of finance is closed and that the 
president expects a new candidate from the government coalition 
for these posts. 
  [Begin recording] [Falandysz] The Small Constitution remains 
in force. A way out must be found. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Which means? 
  [Falandysz] The president states that the decision is a 
final 
one. It is necessary to seek.... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] Does that mean that the 
president is waiting for a new candidate on the part of the 
coalition? 
  [Falandysz] There is no other way out. [end recording] 
  The causes for the rejection of this candidate were 
presented 
by Belweder press spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski. [passage omitted] 
  Dariusz Rosati said in the evening that he is amazed at the 
arguments of the president. 
  [Begin Rosati recording] It is necessary to say that the 
causes cited by Mr. Drzycimski fill me with the greatest 
amazement. The first cause--that I have spent the past two and 
a half years abroad--is incomprehensible to me, if only because 
of the fact that, altogether, I have been concerned solely with 
the Polish economy for the past 20 years. And, for the past two 
years also, working for the United Nations, I have been 
concerned with the Polish economy and that of the countries of 
Central-Eastern Europe. I have permanent contact with the 
country; I read the press; I am in the country six or seven 
times a year. And, and, I have the impression that--I write, in 
any case, I have written and published a lot--I have the 
impression that I am quite well oriented with what is taking 
place in the Polish economy. [end recording] 
  The Democratic Left Alliance-Polish Peasant Party [SLD-PSL] 
coalition and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak continue to 
maintain the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati. The prime minister's 
press office has reported that the prime minister has received 
reports from the prosecutor general and the head of the State 
Protection Office that there are no good reasons for Rosati not 
to assume important state posts. SLD leader Aleksander 
Kwasniewski has expressed the view that President Lech Walesa is 
not concerned that there be stabilization in the country. SLD 
Deputy Chairman Marek Borowski has suggested that it is 
appropriate to consider the limitation of the constitutional 
prerogatives of the president if Lech Walesa maintains his 
decision on the rejection of the candidacy of Rosati. 
  [Begin Borowski recording] If the president decides on this 
type of war--and I stress that the war in this case is being 
called forth by the president, not by the coalition--well, then, 
it will be necessary to consider whether the prerogatives of the 
president are not, quite simply, too great in this situation. 
There are no regulations that cannot be changed, including 
constitutional ones. Certainly, the Small Constitution says 
that the president may reject a candidacy, but there must really 
be exceptionally important reasons. I judge this to be, 
nonetheless, an attempt to drive a wedge between the coalition 
partners and, well, a certain propensity of the president to 
foment. [end recording] 
  Belweder spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski, who is with President 
Walesa in Gdansk, said yesterday that it is not precluded that 
on Monday there will be a follow-up meeting between the 
president and the prime minister. The prime minister will 
receive written justification for the rejection of the candidacy 
of Dariusz Rosati for the post of deputy prime minister and 
minister of finance.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Krzysztof Gottesman, under the "Observations" </F>
rubric] 
  [Text] Dariusz Rosati, a deputy prime minister and finance 
minister candidate, whom the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] has 
very seriously supported, failed to receive presidential 
approval. Aleksander Kwasniewski made assurances Friday [25 
March] that Dariusz Rosati continues to be the joint candidate 
of the prime minister and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]-SLD 
coalition, which is waiting for the president to change his 
decision. But Andrzej Drzycimski, Lech Walesa's spokesman, 
ruled out such a possibility. Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak did 
not speak out on the issue. 
  The course of events may suggest that President Lech Walesa 
may not have been the only one to have doubts about Rosati's 
candidacy. That proposition could have been supported by 
statements coming from the PSL, by Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak's procrastination in his decision, and also by changes 
implemented in the Finance Ministry's leadership. So the 
president could have just willingly implemented a decision that 
the PSL coalition members were in an awkward position to 
implement. There has been a silent accord emerging for some 
time between the president and Waldemar Pawlak. I think both of 
them are equally interested in the SLD, and Aleksander 
Kwasniewski personally, not gaining too strong a position. 
  The SLD is aware of the danger of close cooperation between 
the PSL and the president. That proposition may be supported by 
statements made by [former Finance Minister] Marek Borowski 
concerning the president's unreasonable powers and also by an 
evening session of the SLD Parliamentary Club during which there 
was unequivocal talk of the possibility of the parliament 
confronting the president. It was as if the essence of the 
president's decision was ignored. One can have doubts about 
whether it is a good situation where a deputy prime minister for 
economic affairs and the man responsible for the state's 
finances will be testifying in front of a court of law in the 
future in what is obviously a scandal, regardless of his status 
when in front of the court. 
  First responses by the SLD leader indicate that he and his 
party intend to persist with their candidacy. On the other 
hand, the prime minister's restraint may suggest that the 
current state of "suspension of things" is to his liking. But 
will that not lead to instability in the coalition's situation? 
  The question as to who would gain more out of a possible 
confrontation is open, even though there are many signs today 
that the SLD's position would deteriorate as a result of such a 
confrontation. There are no volunteers willing to form a 
coalition with the SLD. The Democratic Union [UD], which could 
possibly be considered, but with a whole list of reservations, 
is bound not to take such a step after it merges with the 
Liberal-Democratic Congress. The PSL's position seems much more 
comfortable. Neither UD nor the Union of Labor nor the 
presidential Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms (under certain 
terms, of course) rule out by definition cooperation with Pawlak. 
  The impact of the current crisis on the situation within the 
SLD could also be interesting. Aleksander Kwasniewski's 
position within the party may be substantially weakened as a 
result of the recent coalition crises. He may be the recipient 
of a majority of accusations by his colleagues from the party 
concerning lack of efficiency, going along with the PSL, 
excessive self-confidence, and too unequivocal and perhaps not 
always mature opinions expressed. The SLD is not a monolith, 
and it also has three leaders who sooner or later may start 
competing with each other. So it is possible that the recent 
events may be perceived inside the party as mistakes made by a 
leader whose powers should be slightly curtailed "in the name of 
the coalition's continued existence."

<F P=106> ["Declaration by the Foreign Ministers of the </F>
Polish Republic and Ukraine Concerning the Principles of 
Establishing a Polish-Ukrainian Partnership," signed in Warsaw 
on 21 March; furnished by the Polish Foreign Ministry] 
  [Text] The Polish Republic and Ukraine: 
  While taking into account the experiences of our common 
historical past, while being aware of the necessity for further 
development of good-neighborly relations, and while striving to 
strengthen the climate of friendly understanding between the 
Polish and Ukrainian nations, 
  While extrapolating the provisions of the Treaty of 18 May 
1992 between the Polish Republic and Ukraine on good-neighborly 
relations, friendly relations, and cooperation, 
  While confirming their mutual striving and desire to 
facilitate strengthening security in Central and East Europe and 
stabilization of the political situation in the region, 
  While taking into account that both countries have signed 
the 
Framework Document of the "Partnership for Peace" program, 
  While recognizing the vital necessity of multifaceted 
cooperation between the Republic of Poland and Ukraine as states 
that can and should play a significant role in the region of 
Central and East Europe with the aim of solving complicated 
problems based on the principles of an equal-rights and 
democratic partnership, 
  While being in favor of relations between states being based 
on equal rights, and without any application of pressure or 
dictate, 
  While taking into account the mutual efforts to widen the 
cooperation in the field of observing the rights of people who 
belong to national minorities--that is, the Polish minority in 
Ukraine and the Ukrainian minority in Poland, 
  While stressing the importance of developing interregional 
and cross-border cooperation, both in the bilateral and 
multilateral aspect, 
  Declare as follows: 
  1. The existence of an independent Ukraine is of a strategic 
dimension to Poland and is an important factor conducive to its 
independence, just like the existence of an independent Poland 
is of a strategic dimension to Ukraine. 
  2. On the basis of the assumption of irreversibility of the 
changes that took place in Europe, the Polish Republic and 
Ukraine express their conviction that a practical implementation 
of the idea of a close Polish-Ukrainian partnership will 
contribute to the establishment of an effective, all-European 
security system. 
  3. Active measures by the Polish Republic and Ukraine for 
the 
sake of establishing an all-European security system should 
prevent the emergence of new divisions, the rebirth of 
tendencies of a hegemonisitc nature, and the creation of spheres 
of influence. 
  Particular importance will be attached to cooperation of the 
two countries within the Framework Document of the "Partnership 
for Peace" program, and also within the United Nations, the 
CSCE, and NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council]. 
  4. Concerted counteraction against potential dangers to 
stabilization in Central and East Europe, of both a military and 
a nonmilitary nature, will require a widening and a 
strengthening of cooperation based on the principles of equality 
between the Polish Republic and Ukraine and all of the countries 
of the region. 
  5. While appreciating the significance of economic factors 
in the shaping of contemporary Europe and the world, the Polish 
Republic and Ukraine will intensify the close and mutually 
beneficial economic cooperation and also the exchange of 
experiences in the area of implementing processes of economic 
transformations; they will also undertake multifaceted measures 
conducive to their efficient implementation. 
  6. While affirming their attachment to democratic principles 
and values and regarding their observance as determining the 
future of the Polish Republic and Ukraine, both countries will 
be guided by principles according to which observance of 
fundamental human rights and freedoms, including the rights of 
national minorities, is an indispensable condition for 
strengthening peace and security in Europe. 
  7. The Polish Republic and Ukraine affirm their attachment 
to common values of the European civilization, which they will 
use as guidelines in cooperation both between themselves and 
with other countries of our continent. 
  8. The Polish Republic and Ukraine will facilitate the 
widest possible inclusion of voivodships, districts, 
enterprises, organizations, and citizens of both countries in 
economic, humanitarian, and cultural cooperation, including the 
"Karpaty" Euroregion. 
  The declaration was written in Warsaw on 21 March 1994, in 
two copies--that is, in Polish and Ukrainian--with both texts 
being authentic.

<F P=106> [Text of speech by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy </F>
Zlenko at the Eastern Studies Center in Warsaw on 22 
March--furnished by the Polish Foreign Ministry] 
  [Text] Dear Mr. Director! Ladies and Gentlemen! 
  First of all, I want to thank you for the honor of being 
able 
to speak at your center, which has gained worldwide recognition 
as an institution whose analyses, advice, and forecasts are 
attentively listened to, not just in Poland but also beyond its 
borders. 
  So I expect my speech to contribute to a better 
understanding 
of concepts that are the current guidelines for the Ukrainian 
Government in its hard work aimed at strengthening a sovereign 
Ukraine in European international relations, and also that it 
will contribute to a better understanding of our approach to 
contemporary political realities. 
  The restitution of the Ukrainian state, as the two years of 
its independent existence have shown, is taking place under 
extremely complicated external and domestic conditions. To a 
great extent, these conditions are a consequence of historical 
eruptions that took place in Europe in the late 1980's and early 
1990's. Unfortunately, our expectations of speedy reforms and 
the unconditional acceptance of Ukraine into the European 
community of nations did not materialize. Also, our 
expectations of speedy assistance on the part of Western 
countries came across the fact that these countries, while 
undergoing serious crises in their own economies, were not able 
to come up with sufficient resources to support young and 
independent states, including Ukraine. It is also true that it 
would be a mistake not to see some prejudices and old-fashioned 
stereotypes in the politics of some countries. 
  It was also difficult to predict that, along with the 
elimination of military and political confrontation between the 
two blocs, the world is not going to become a safer place, and 
the degree of predictability with regard to individual 
countries' behavior will not increase at all. 
  Bloody conflicts are going on in various regions of the 
globe, which require much effort and many resources on the part 
of developed countries and the entire international community. 
International organizations whose goal was to maintain and 
assure peace are faced with new and unexpected challenges that 
force the world to change its approach to many problems that 
have, so far, not been unequivocally resolved. 
  Ukraine does not exist in a vacuum, nor is it isolated from 
the world and these events. The complexity of the new situation 
in Europe and around the world required a constant search for 
ways of maneuvering so as to lead the country through the 
underwater reefs that emerge at points of disagreement among the 
countries of the world, as well as at points where different and 
sometimes contradictory interests and trends cross one another. 
  There are also many specific domestic factors that do not 
make our situation any easier. You are aware, ladies and 
gentlemen, that Ukraine inherited, as a legacy of the former 
USSR, an industry that is oriented primarily to the production 
of products of the military-industrial complex, and also morally 
exploited technologies, completely amortized industrial 
equipment, the enormous burden of the Chernobyl disaster, as 
well as many other problems, the overcoming of which would be 
difficult for even the world's most developed countries. A 
whole list of objective and subjective reasons also led to a 
decline in production and a rise in inflation. Within the 
complicated economic situation, a constant shaping of Ukraine's 
internal political system is taking place. Currently, as never 
before, we are radically feeling the need for cardinal changes 
in the activities of the legislative, executive, and judicial 
branches. Of course, under conditions where mistakes simply 
cannot be avoided, many people find it hard to resist the 
temptation of making political capital. At the same time, 
representatives of a whole range of organizations, parties, and 
movements have been using the most disgraceful of methods: 
preying on national and religious feelings, applying completely 
unmotivated incitements to strike, and cultivating separatist 
ideas. 
  But the Ukrainian nation and Government have already made 
the final choice. While not paying attention to any kind of 
obstacles, we will persistently follow the path of a return to 
all-human values, the creation of a state based on law, and the 
guaranteeing of human rights and freedoms; it is the path of 
democracy and economic transformations, a rebirth of Ukrainian 
culture with simultaneous legal guarantees of maintaining the 
independence of all national and ethnic minorities living in 
Ukraine. 
  The fundamental principle of securing state independence and 
political sovereignty has been the basis for Ukraine's foreign 
policy doctrine from the very beginning. As one of the founding 
members of the United Nations, Ukraine declared its desire to 
shape and develop its relations with other countries in 
accordance with the UN Charter, decisions contained in the Final 
Act of the Helsinki Conference, the Paris Charter for New 
Europe, and other CSCE documents. Nonconditional observance of 
generally recognized norms of international law and 
nonapplication of any means of pressure or dictate whatsoever in 
international relations, acquired special importance in 
Ukraine's foreign policy. 
  Taking the aforementioned principles as the basis, we wanted 
Ukraine's entry onto the international scene as a sovereign 
country to take place in the "softest" way possible, without 
interfering with relationships and connections existing in the 
international community. At the same time, Ukraine, due to many 
factors and reasons and aware of its role in the world, intends 
to achieve the place it rightly deserves among European 
countries. I would like our fundamental and priority-based 
approach to be well understood: Ukraine is an inherent and 
inseparable part of Europe, and that fact determines the 
philosophy and direction of our ideas on Ukraine's place and 
role in the contemporary world. Precisely because of that, 
overcoming the artificial separation of Ukraine from Europe, as 
well as overcoming the barriers which continue to exist and 
divide our not-too-big continent, is one of the most significant 
tasks of our independent policy. The policy is aimed at 
securing certain guarantees of Ukraine's external security, 
using experiences acquired by European democracies in the area 
of building a democratic society of law and order which would be 
an inseparable part of European political, legal, economic, 
material, and spiritual culture. 
  A return to the practice of bilateral relations with other 
countries after a break of 70 years, is a fact which cannot be 
overestimated from the standpoint of building an independent and 
democratic Ukraine. At the same time, we view the European 
region as a whole, and as a common home for all nations and 
countries which live here. The full integration of Ukraine into 
all-European political, economic, cultural, and other kinds of 
associations, is our final goal. 
  It is quite a natural thing that neighboring countries are 
of 
primary importance in that activity. That is why the fact that 
Russia, Poland, Hungary, Belarus, Moldova, the Slovak Republic, 
and Romania are our geographical neighbors, requires working out 
precisely this kind of policy, that is one of approaching them 
as neighbors with whom one wants to see peaceful coexistence, 
cooperation, and mutual respect. That is an objective reality 
and must be perceived precisely in that context. 
  Speaking about bilateral relations, I would like to discuss 
separately Ukraine's relations with the Republic of Poland. We 
remember and we highly appreciate the fact that your country was 
the first foreign country to have recognized Ukraine's 
independence. After Ukraine gained its independence, relations 
between our two countries, which have a balance of common, 
European interests as their basis, entered a qualitatively new 
stage and right now we are fully entitled to describe them as 
relations of a strategic partnership. The decision to establish 
a Consultative Committee of the Presidents of Ukraine and the 
Polish Republic, which was made during the visit of Polish 
President L. Walesa to Ukraine, is proof that Poland also treats 
Polish-Ukrainian relations in an appropriate manner. The 
committee's activity includes analyzing and preparing proposals 
concerning a wide variety of issues which emerge in relations 
between Ukraine and Poland, as well as problems of the Central 
and East European region and international politics. 
  Ukraine is a European country and in its desire to integrate 
with European political and economic structures in the most 
natural way possible, it is condemned to the necessity of 
developing multifaceted relations with European countries, with 
economically developed ones as priority, whose assistance 
Ukraine counts on in the current period, which is very 
complicated from the standpoint of making our economic and 
political independence permanent. 
  The development of relations with Western European countries 
creates the necessary conditions for resuming Ukraine's 
political, economic, cultural, and spiritual ties with European 
civilization, as well as for speeding up the democratization 
process, the implementation of market reforms, and nursing the 
national economy back to health. At the same time, such 
cooperation will become a basis for widening Ukraine's 
participation in European structures and for the future 
integration of the Ukrainian economy into the European and world 
economic area. 
  Access to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean determines 
other priorities in the area of regional cooperation, first of 
all with countries enjoying some authority, primarily with 
Turkey, Greece, and Bulgaria. 
  Our country attaches great importance to the development of 
mutually beneficial and effective bilateral relations with 
countries of the Asian and Pacific region which, due to its 
extremely high rate of economic and social development by a 
majority of countries in the region, has quite correctly been 
called the "region of the 21st century." 
  The process of a practical shaping of partnership relations 
between Ukraine and countries of the Asian and Pacific region, 
has already begun and it is bringing results which can be felt 
as time passes--that is demonstrated first of all by the results 
of last year's official visits to Ukraine by state and 
government delegations (including at the highest level) from 
India, the People's Republic of China, Vietnam, and other 
countries. 
  But it is with the year 1994 that we associate our special 
hopes linked to the implementation of enormous prospects for 
Ukraine's cooperation with countries of the Asian and Pacific 
region. Our relations of mutual understanding and cooperation 
with Japan and also with North and South Korea, are beginning to 
take the desired course. 
  We regard the development of relations with countries of the 
Near and Middle East, as well as Africa, as one of the most 
important directions of Ukrainian foreign policy; these 
countries are gradually becoming our economic partners. The 
official visits by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to Egypt, 
Israel, and the Republic of Tunisia, are proof of our intentions 
and readiness to develop mutually beneficial cooperation with 
the countries of these regions. 
  Our relations with the United States in military and 
political areas, are valuable to us; this applies in particular 
to common security and disarmament. But the priority nature of 
these relations is not just a consequence of that: Currently, 
economic cooperation with that huge country is important to 
Ukraine. 
  As for our relations with Russia, they remain the main 
priority in Ukraine's relations with the outside world, and this 
is the way they will remain in the predictable future. Russia 
is our most important neighbor. Our approach to the development 
of these relations is defined in detail in "The Main directions 
of Ukrainian Foreign Policy." We understand that Russia is a 
special kind of partner to us and that is why we regard our 
relations as those of a special partnership. Of course, there 
are also many problems in the development of our relations, as 
we have seen during 1993, these problems were first of all 
caused by the fact that issues linked to the collapse of the 
former Soviet Union continue to be unresolved. This applies in 
particular to the problem of legal continuity, the property of 
the former USSR, as well as some others. Some constructive 
measures have been undertaken in that regard in the recent time 
period. We have always been saying--and we will continue to do 
so--that Ukraine is open to any proposals which would not 
conflict with our national interests, and these are the 
realities of our approach to the development of relations with 
Russia. 
  We believe that compromises are certainly important; 
however, they must correspond to the fundamental interests of 
this or that state. It is understandable that the internal 
political situation that has now developed in Russia compels us 
to make some reflections. It may be necessary to work in not 
very favorable conditions; however, this will not change our 
view that we must work. We are ready for such work. I would 
like to emphasize once again, however, that real achievements in 
the development of Ukrainian-Russian relations may be made only 
if every political decision takes into account, to the maximum 
degree possible, the interests of both parties. Vital is the 
good will of both partners; the Ukrainian side exhibits such a 
good will. 
  In the situation which has now developed in Russia and some 
other states of the CIS, also due to the conflicts which pose a 
real threat to peace and stability not only on the territory of 
the former Soviet Union, but also in all of East Europe, one can 
say that the 52 million Ukrainians are able to play and are 
already playing a serious stabilizing role throughout the 
post-Soviet areas. Therefore, one of our main priorities is 
supporting the process of strengthening stability and security, 
both in Europe and in our regional relations. 
  Being aware of the importance of both regional and national 
activities for strengthening the stability and security in 
Europe, Ukraine confirmed its devotion to these goals by firmly 
starting along the road to achieving the status of a nonnuclear 
state. This is proven by the signing on 14 January of the 
well-known Trilateral Declaration by the presidents of Ukraine, 
the United States, and Russia, as well as the recent decision by 
the Supreme Council of Ukraine canceling the reservations 
included in the resolution on the ratification of START I. This 
exceptionally important decision paves the way for the practical 
implementation of the program of the gradual nuclear disarmament 
of Ukraine, as well as renders the overall situation in Europe 
and in the world more stable and predictable. 
  Considering the principle of the indivisibility of 
international peace and security to be one of our main guides, 
in our foreign policy we defend the approach of "security for 
ourselves through security for everyone." Considering this 
principle to be the motto of contemporary European international 
relations, it is with particular responsibility that we approach 
one of the most important elements of the situation in Europe 
today--the ability of each European state, including those 
called "new democracies," not only to seek, but also create 
security. 
  In this context, the role of Ukraine, as we understand it, 
is 
tremendously important because, as a consequence of Ukraine's 
regaining its statehood in Europe, a radically new geopolitical 
situation has developed. 
  The establishment of a potentially powerful state, located 
in 
the geographical center of Europe, and its entry into the 
European community without any conflict should play a 
stabilizing role. Such a role certainly corresponds to the 
principles of Ukraine's foreign policy. Our diplomatic efforts 
concentrate on establishing and strengthening stable 
international mechanisms of security on the bilateral, 
subregional, regional, and global level. This task is rather 
difficult and it must be resolved in not-very-favorable 
surroundings, because when new independent states appeared, 
whose national interests have not been established and agreed 
upon yet, the old structural mechanisms, supporting stability 
and security, were practically destroyed. This produced the 
effect of the so-called security vacuum, which was felt by 
practically all the new democracies. Old threats and dangers 
were replaced by new ones. 
  Bearing the above-mentioned facts in mind, Ukraine launched 
an initiative to create a zone of stability and security in 
Central and East Europe. This idea is to a certain extent 
convergent with the approach which was once proposed by Polish 
President L. Walesa, and then also by French Prime Minister E. 
Balladur. The most important element in our approach is that 
stability and instability cannot coexist for a long time without 
conflict. The stability of "traditional Europe" is supposed to 
become the stability of "the new Europe." Each participant 
should make serious efforts so that this can be achieved. 
  Since the confrontation of military blocks in Europe has 
ceased to exist, especially important becomes the issue of 
establishing an all-European security structure on the basis of 
existing international organizations, such as CSCE, NATO, 
Council of North Atlantic Cooperation, and the Western European 
Union. We are convinced that only the direct membership of 
Ukraine in such a structure will provide it with indispensable 
guarantees of its national security. 
  An important role in the strengthening of security in the 
CSCE region is played by NATO. Ukraine actively participates in 
the activities of its new organ--the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council, the establishment of which was indisputably a logical 
and bold step. However, time is running out. Present-day 
challenges call for a new look at the concept of the activities, 
the role, and the place of NATO in Europe. A significant step 
in this direction was the acceptance of the "Partnership for 
Peace" program at the NATO summit in January. Ukraine expressed 
its readiness for active cooperation with NATO within this 
program, and I myself have recently had the honor to place my 
signature on the "Partnership for Peace" framework document. 
Thus, our country was the first CIS state to join this program. 
It was with understanding that Ukraine responded to this 
initiative, as one that does not introduce any new lines of 
division in Europe, leaves an open door to NATO, and is an 
instrument for gradually extending this organization for the 
purpose of shaping a new security system in Europe. At the same 
time we believe that it is extremely important and indispensable 
to resolve the problem of NATO's continuing search for its new 
role in the process of building the European security system and 
the problem of the organization's overcoming its "identity 
crisis" in the contemporary, postconfrontation Europe. 
  Certainly the issue of ensuring stability and security in 
the 
new Europe is multidimensional and complex. It comprises 
elements of a military-political nature, as well as economic, 
social, cultural, humanitarian, and other areas. We understand 
that in all those directions, we must face very difficult tests. 
We also understand that the main burden of passing from the 
communist model of development to the European, democratic model 
will have to be carried by ourselves. At the same time, we 
expect that the importance of the tasks that we must face will 
encourage all of Europe to give some thought to the current 
situation and to understand the significance of uniting their 
efforts in the work of building a more secure and flourishing 
new Europe. 
  Economic relations, both bilateral and multilateral, with 
European countries are of tremendous importance to us. As we 
worked on the concept of Ukraine's regional cooperation, we bore 
in mind the obvious necessity of "economizing" our contacts, 
increasing the commercial-economic aspect of Ukraine's 
participation in regional organizations. Only this road will be 
able to lead us to effective implementation of economic 
transformations of the country and to the transition to the 
market economy. Ukraine's firm goal is the development and 
deepening of comprehensive cooperation with the EC and gradual 
integration into the Pan-European economic zone. Right now we 
still need aid and support from the European Union and leading 
European financial establishments. 
  We are aware of the fact that the full incorporation of 
Ukraine in the contemporary all-European process in all its 
dimensions calls for some time, considerable efforts, and an 
open request on the part of all the interested parties. We 
speak about the latter firmly and openly, taking into 
consideration our real possibilities and the results of the 
lasting integration of the economic and social systems within 
the former Soviet Union and the Council for Economic Mutual 
Assistance. 
  I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Ukraine 
not only wants to be incorporated into the integration processes 
in the West, but it also supports real, new integration 
processes in the East. It is most important to abandon, within 
those integration processes, the centralized system of 
controlling the economy, and to strengthen qualitatively new 
relations that are mutually favorable and effective. 
  Right now in Ukraine, active preparations are under way for 
the adoption of a new constitution; soon we will hold 
practically the first democratic elections to the organs of the 
legislative authorities. A general strategy of the country's 
economic and political development is being defined. Despite 
great difficulties, fundamental elements of democracy and a 
socially oriented market economy are taking root in our social 
life. Moreover, Ukraine managed to maintain the most important 
things: peace and social, civic, and ethnic order. 
  Today we can say with full responsibility that there is no 
alternative to democracy and economic reform for Ukraine. In 
the future, we see Ukraine as a democratic state with equal 
rights in a united Europe. We expect you to actively support 
this historical striving of ours. 
  Thank you for your attention.

  [Text] At his weekly news conference today, Presidential 
Spokesman Ambassador Traian Chebeleu said that, in accordance 
with constitutional provisions, Romanian President Ion Iliescu 
has signed 24 individual pardons, including for those involved 
in the murders committed at Albesti, Zetea, and Dealul [villages 
in Transylvania where Romanian policemen were killed by ethnic 
Hungarians during the December 1989 events] and former candidate 
members of the former Political Executive Committee of the 
Romanian Communist Party. In reply to a question as to whether 
the pardons have anything to do with the visit of the Council of 
Europe rapporteurs, Chebeleu answered in the affirmative, to the 
extent that some of the rapporteurs have brought up the issue of 
certain interventions made by the Democratic Union of Hungarians 
in Romania [UDMR] in this respect. 
  In connection with President Iliescu's meeting with the 
chief 
editors of the main dailies on 21 March, Traian Chebeleu said 
that two letters are now being drafted to be sent to Petre Mihai 
Bacanu [chief editor of ROMANIA LIBERA] and Ion Cristoiu [chief 
editor of EVENIMENTUL ZILEI], explaining the exact purpose of 
the meeting. 
  The spokesman denied rumors that the government has revised 
its decision to appoint General Niculae Spiroiu as our country's 
representative at NATO headquarters in Brussels.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister Peter Boross by </F>
correspondent Laszlo Rapcsanyi; place and date not given; 
passages within quotation marks are recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] The radio today carried an interview 
with Prime Minister Peter Boross. The reporter was Laszlo 
Rapcsanyi. From the topics of the one-hour interview, first we 
quote Peter Boross talking about the advance of the left wing. 
  [Boross] "It is indisputable that the Hungarian Socialist 
Party [HSP] is going to achieve a more favorable result than at 
the elections four years ago. It is also doubtless, I note -- 
not so much, and not first and foremost on the level of 
leadership but in the ranks of the returning members -- there 
will be some shift to the left. Despite this, I am not afraid 
of a rollback. Essentally, the Hungarian parliament today 
consists of sane politicians. No such rollback can take place 
for this very reason." 
  [Announcer] After this the prime minster talked about the 
role of the trade unions and the HSP, considering the chances 
for the near future. 
  [Boross] "The trade unions have gained significant ground 
within the HSP. This threatens the HSP's functioning as a 
political party. I have to say that I can see a dual phenomenon 
here: If by any chance the HSP gets a government role then an 
excessive trade union force would make the program, hallmarked 
by the name of Laszlo Bekesi, simply inexecutable." 
  [Announcer] Since there are only six weeks until the 
elections there was of course mention of the chances of the 
liberal parties. 
  [Boross] "I consider it natural that the liberal parties are 
decreasing and slowly crumbling away. Some time later they will 
be represented in Hungarian political life in a proportion which 
is typical of most countries. I think this election contest is 
really between the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the HSP. 
The erosion of the two party formations in the range between 
them is unavoidable." 
  [Announcer] What can be expected generally after the 
election 
results are known? Who can form a coalition with whom? 
According to Peter Boross: 
  [Boross] "Every party has to decide what future a coalition 
relationship can have, from the viewpoint of its future, even if 
it seems to be somehow tactical or -- under various pressures -- 
expedient to form a coalition with certain parties. Are they 
not too distant from one another? If so, they can set up a 
coalition at a roundtable, but they cannot make the coalition 
work." 
  [Announcer] Can a coalition which was set up under pressure 
be viable? 
  [Boross] "There is the possibility that the next elections 
will not be held in four years' time, if the parliamentary power 
relations given by the election results make it impossible to 
create a sustainable majority. It is typical that there was a 
prediction which estimated the Hungarian political balance as 30 
percent so-called Christian conservatives, 30 percent liberals, 
and 30 percent socialists. Well, those who are familiar with 
the participants of Hungarian politics know that if this were to 
come about, it would result in a state of ungovernability." 
  [Announcer] The opposition accuses the government of 
pursuing 
a propaganda which only emphasises the successes. The prime 
minister's opinion about this: 
  [Boross] "We have to show that we have achieved results in 
the difficult situation the country is facing and under the 
extremely testing circumstances of the transformation. The 
other side should come up with concrete proof about specific 
issues -- not criticize everything with general phrases. The 
leftist part of the parliament knows and the opposition press 
knows that the MDF or the government -- I always need to mention 
them together -- fails to mention the fact that it has preserved 
the value of savings with an appropriate interest policy, 
something which has not been done in any of the neighboring 
countries. It has indeed preserved this." 
  [Announcer] At the end of the interview Prime Minister Peter 
Boross talked about his plans. 
  [Boross] "I would like to work as prime minister for another 
four years. This half year was not enough. I believe I know 
what should be done in the next four years and I feel I have 
enough strength for the implementation of my ideas."

<F P=106> [Article by Marie Susterova: "Laws in the Czech Republic Are </F>
Tough on Foreigners"] 
  [Text] Close to 80 million foreigners headed for the Czech 
Republic in 1993. The majority of them came for a brief visit 
or as tourists. Although they can extend their stay to up to 
six months, the law does not permit them to work in the Czech 
Republic. It permits only foreigners who have long-term or 
permanent residence in the Czech Republic--for example, 
foreigners who have obtained the statute of refugee in the Czech 
Republic--to work. 
  Approximately 46,600 foreigners with long-term residence and 
31,000 foreigners with permanent residence live in the Czech 
Republic. This is apparent from the Foreign Nationals 
Registration Office (CP) record of 31 December 1993. They are 
mainly Poles, Vietnamese, and Ukrainians; however, in the past 
two years, people from Germany, the United States, Greece, and 
Austria have also shown an interest in long-term residence in 
the Czech Republic. To what, then, do our laws entitle them? 
Mirka Polova, of the CP Secretariat, says that long-term 
residence for the purpose of employment, business, education, or 
medical treatment is permitted. The foreigner can make the 
arrangements for the permit in his own country or when he 
arrives in the Czech Republic. As opposed to our practices, a 
foreigner who travels to the West or the United States to work 
must expedite the necessary documents in his own country. The 
foreigner attaches to his application in the Czech Republic 
confirmation that he has accommodation and a work permit. 
Long-term residence is granted for 180 days and can be 
repeatedly extended as long as the foreigner is studying, 
conducting business, or working in the Czech Republic. 
According to the law, the state is not obliged to grant 
permanent residence even to a foreigner who has been living here 
continually for a long time. According to M. Polova, this is a 
shortcoming that should be resolved in the future. The previous 
law was more charitable to foreigners. After 10 years of 
continuous long-term residence in the Czech Republic, it 
entitled them to apply for Czech citizenship. These foreigners 
pay for health care in the Czech Republic and they have no claim 
to social support from the state. 
  Permanent residence is granted to foreigners in order to 
unite families and, quite exceptionally, for humanitarian or 
foreign policy reasons, M. Polova explained to LIDOVE NOVINY. 
Foreigners with authorized permanent residence have, in 
essence, the same rights as Czech citizens. However, as opposed 
to them, they cannot vote, apply for property to be returned in 
restitution, or take part in coupon privatization. 
Nevertheless, they do have a right, for example, to 
unemployment benefit. After five years of permanent residence, 
they can obtain Czech citizenship. The resettled Czechs from 
Chernobyl, for example, are in this category. 
  We will publish information later about the foreigners who 
apply for asylum in the Czech Republic.

<F P=106> [Article by Antonia Vymazalova: "Revision in a Week; The </F>
Government Discussed Filling Posts of State Secretaries"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava--Yesterday the Slovak Government 
held its third meeting with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik in the 
chair. [passage omitted] 
  The government discussed and approved a draft amendment to 
the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] law on the 
organization of ministries and other central bodies of state 
administration of the Slovak Republic. As Deputy Prime Minister 
Ivan Simko told a news conference after the government meeting, 
the law addresses the issue of ending the provisional 
arrangement and legal vacuum that arose after the establishment 
of the independent Slovak Republic. The government will submit 
the draft amendment to the current meeting of parliament. Under 
the amendment, the government can determine in justified cases 
that two state secretaries will operate at a ministry. The 
minister will determine in which order they will stand in for 
him. The Government Office of the Slovak Republic is being 
deleted from the system of other central bodies of state 
administration [under the amendment] because it will only 
fulfill tasks for the government's needs. The Labor Safety 
Office of the Slovak Republic, on the other hand, is being added 
to the central bodies of state administration. The government 
yesterday appointed Jan Filko, LL.D., to head the Government 
Office. Until now, Filko has been deputy chairman of the Slovak 
Government's Legislative Council. [passage omitted] 
  The government took note of a report on basic trends in the 
development of the national economy of the Slovak Republic in 
1993 and their forecast for the first half of 1994. The report 
notes that state budget expenditures went up as a result of the 
establishment of the new state and in connection with 
safeguarding its operation. The higher expenditures have been 
reflected in an increase of the budget deficit to 23 billion 
Slovak korunas [Sk] [in 1993]. It is expected that, in the 
first half of 1994, a trend of recovery will start making itself 
felt in the material-production branches. The volume of gross 
domestic product in steady prices is therefore expected to drop 
by only 0.6 percent. The rate of unemployment will increase to 
16.5 percent, which means 420,000 registered unemployed. The 
rate of inflation will reach 17.4 percent, and average monthly 
wages will go up to Sk5,700, which would be a 15.2-percent 
increase over the first half of 1993 but a 1.9-percent decline 
in real terms. [passage omitted] 
  Yesterday the government appointed Pavol Nunuk, LL.D., to 
the 
post of chief border commissioner of the Slovak Republic and 
Colonel Miroslav Hyres, LL.D., and Colonel Mikulas Salak, LL.D., 
to the posts of deputy chief border commissioners of the Slovak 
Republic. Furthermore, it approved the following proposals for 
the appointment as state secretaries: Ministry of 
Justice--Sergej Kohut, LL.D.; Ministry of Culture--Marina 
Jurickova, M.A.; Ministry of Environment--Lubomira Zimanova, 
LL.D.; Ministry for the Administration and Privatization of 
National Property--Gabriel Palacka, doctor of natural sciences; 
and Ministry of Agriculture--Engineer Stefan Palacka. It also 
approved proposals for the appointment of heads of ministerial 
offices: Ministry of Defense--Colonel of the General Staff 
Engineer Rudolf Zidek; Ministry of Transportation, 
Communications, and Public Works--Engineer Peter Klucka; 
Ministry of Economy--Engineer Jaroslav Kubecka; Ministry of 
Environment--Engineer Magdalena Vodzinska; and Ministry of 
Agriculture--Engineer Jan Straka. The government approved the 
proposal to appoint Marian Jusko vice governor of the Slovak 
National Bank. It will submit this proposal to the NRSR 
chairman for further constitutional discussion. 
  Yesterday's news conference was moderated by Lubomir 
Lintner, 
who has been newly appointed as director of the Slovak 
Government Office's Press and Information Department.

  [Text] Bratislava--Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik 
installed new Defense Minister Pavol Kanis in his post yesterday 
at a meeting with Defense Ministry military and civilian 
personnel. Major General Andrej Sabol was appointed Defense 
Ministry state secretary and Colonel Rudolf Zidek was appointed 
head of the Defense Ministry Office. In his speech, the prime 
minister emphasized that the Slovak Republic requires 
high-quality and advanced Army and patriotic soldiers, who will 
fulfill their tasks regardless of which political grouping is in 
power. In expressing his appreciation, Minister Kanis said, 
among other things, that, in the coming weeks, it will be 
necessary to prepare a thorough analysis of the Slovak Army's 
first year. It is essential to improve the style and method of 
managerial work at the Defense Ministry and the Slovak Army 
Command "because the current system in many ways still resembles 
the old bipolar system," emphasized Kanis.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 25 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia warned on 
Friday that sending Turkish troops to the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina could directly influence further 
escalation of conflicts in the region. 
  A decision by U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to 
accept Turkish troops for the U.N. peacekeeping force in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina departs from the principle agreed on when 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] was set up that no troops of 
neighbouring countries, as well as of countries whose presence 
was not acceptable in these areas for historical reasons, would 
be deployed in the territory of former Yugoslavia, a statement 
issued from the Yugoslav Secretariat for Foreign Affairs a copy 
of which was given to TANJUG said. 
  The Turkish Ottoman Empire ruled from the 14th until the end 
of the 19th century in the area which is now former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and then a Slav (predominantly the Serb 
Orthodox) people had undergone Islamization. Turks ruled much 
of the Balkans until the early years of this century. 
  The issued statement warned that by its lack of objectivity 
and one-sidedness Turkey had a continual negative effect in the 
areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina and that was why Turkish troops were 
unacceptable as part of the U.N. peace-keeping force in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on any grounds. 
  Under the U.N. Charter, the U.N. Security Council and U.N. 
secretary-general were directly responsible for peace and 
international security and in case of the civil war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, they have to do everything possible to reach 
a lasting peace as soon as possible, and not to contribute to 
escalation of the conflict, the statement said.

<F P=106> [Article by Ewa Szymanska from Washington: "Military </F>
Cooperation With U.S.A.; Kolodziejczyk Signed Agreement With 
Perry"; last paragraph unattributed] 
  [Text] The solemn signing of a Polish-U.S. agreement 
on development of military cooperation was the highlight of a 
three-day visit to Washington by Defense Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk. The agreement, which on the U.S. part was signed 
by Defense Secretary William Perry, provides for regular 
meetings at the level of chiefs of staff and of military 
delegations, the possibility of the Polish military 
participating in U.S. training sessions, and U.S. support for 
modernization of the Polish Armed Forces. The agreement also 
provides for assistance to Poland in preparing our Army for 
cooperation with the Armed Forces of the NATO countries. 
  After signing the declaration on cooperation, Minister 
Kolodziejczyk stated that the declaration expresses a full 
openness to cooperation and a new approach to Poland's role and 
place. From among the visit's specific results, Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk mentioned the establishment of a Polish-U.S. 
technical commission, whose goal is to assist with the Polish 
Army's modernization and also with restructuring the Polish 
defense industry. Defense Secretary William Perry accepted an 
invitation to pay a visit to Poland. No specific date for joint 
Polish-U.S. military exercises has been set, but General John 
Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with whom 
Kolodziejczyk had a meeting at the end of his U.S. visit, agreed 
to the minister's suggestion that they take place before the end 
of the year and that some U.S. troops participate in the Polish 
Army's maneuvers that had been planned earlier. 
  Minister Kolodziejczyk's talks on Capitol Hill have already 
resulted in first reactions. During a Senate debate, Senator 
Mitch McConnell spoke in favor of making more specific the 
criteria for participation by countries of the East in the 
"Partnership for Peace" program. McConnell also submitted a 
proposal for an amendment to a draft of a Senate bill concerning 
the appropriation of resources for military goals. The 
amendment contains the following passage: "The Unites States 
shall oppose, by applying the appropriate means, any attempts by 
the Russian Federation aimed at intimidation, using military 
force or economic blackmail, with the goal of restitution of 
spheres of influence on the territory of the former Soviet 
Republics, in the Baltic states, and in Central and East Europe." 
  When asked about his Washington meetings, Minister 
Kolodziejczyk replied that he is so optimistic that he is 
"afraid to push my luck." Concerning the sale of Polish 
helicopters to Burma, which was reported by news agencies in the 
morning, he said only that the matter has been cleared up. 
Poland was reported to have sold helicopters to Burma, where 
human rights are violated. 
  --Of the 13 countries that signed the so-called framework 
agreement with NATO concerning "Partnership for Peace," Poland 
was the first to initiate consultations with NATO regarding the 
program's specific contents. There are predictions that 
consultations concerning the so-called document of presentation 
will last several weeks.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Turkish President Suleyman </F>
Demirel by Cristina Oroveanu; place and date not given: "We Are 
Ready To Support Romania by Any Means"] 
  [Text] [Oroveanu] Mr. President, we would like you to 
describe to our readers the Turkey of today, facts and options. 
  [Demirel] At this time, Turkey continues to enjoy the fruits 
of democracy with all its principles, bodies, and concepts. 
Democratic freedoms have been institutionalized and the 
constitutional system guarantees democratic freedoms and the 
observance of human rights for everyone. 
  Turkey has successfully gone through the transition process 
to a free market economy. So far 70 percent of Turkey's economy 
has been liberalized. A substantial improvement in the 
qualification of human resources and of the potential of 
entrepreneurs have helped us open rapidly to the world. 
  Along with the conclusion of the Cold War, Turkey's 
geopolitical and economic situation gained in importance and we 
have become an island of stability both in our area and in the 
world. At this point, we are in the midst of the instability in 
our area. In accordance with the UN Charter and international 
law, we assume responsibility in bringing peace and stability in 
these sources of conflict. 
  [Oroveanu] Mr. President, with what thoughts have you come 
to Romania on this visit? 
  [Demirel] The Turkish people have always harbored feelings 
of friendship for the Romanian people. We have lived in peace 
throughout history, both during good and bad times. We share 
common ideals and aims regarding the promotion of our nation's 
wellbeing and regarding peace and stability in the area in which 
we live. Our relations are based on mutual respect and 
cooperation. Thus, the means to intensify relations between the 
two countries have always been clear. 
  It is enough to consider the list of recent official visits, 
at all levels, to Turkey or to Romania to realize the potential 
of our political will to continue to develop our friendly 
relations. These visits are excellent opportunities to identify 
-- on the basis of the already existing potential -- new and 
varied realms of cooperation between our countries. These 
visits also permit us to consult each other about important 
questions of regional interest for both countries. 
  The search for new opportunities of cooperation regarding 
global problems is also one of our common aims. 
  Finally, we believe that the "Treaty of Friendship, 
Good-Neighborliness, and Cooperation" between Turkey and Romania 
reflects the desire for peace by the two peoples. 
  With these thoughts I am looking forward to my visit to 
Romania. 
  [Oroveanu] Considering the political, historic, and 
geographical situation, in your opinion, what role may Turkey 
and Romania play together in our area and in the existing 
overall international relations? 
  [Demirel] The traditional friendship between Turkey and 
Romania does not only represent the foundation for intensifying 
cooperation between the two countries in all areas, but also 
constitutes a factor for ensuring an atmosphere of peace, 
understanding, and cooperation in the Balkans. 
  Turkey and Romania are two important countries in this area. 
From a regional point of view, our countries are important in 
the Balkans both in terms of population and economic potential. 
Both endorse a responsible policy of promoting peace and 
stability in this area. Both are struggling for seeking a just 
and lasting solution to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Their desire to contribute to peace in this area is welcomed by 
the international community. Therefore, it is natural for the 
excellent relations between Turkey and Romania to contribute to 
establishing stability in the Balkans. 
  At the same time, both Turkey and Romania want to be part of 
the European structures, whose principles they honestly embrace. 
They are both members of the Treaty of Cooperation in the Black 
Sea Area and both support the initiatives for cooperation in the 
Balkans. Turkey and Romania and, like them, the entire area have 
gained a great deal from cooperating within these forums, as 
well as within other regional and international organizations. 
  [Oroveanu] Mr. President, in your view, what are the chances 
for the cooperation projects in the Black Sea area and its 
immediate vicinity? 
  [Demirel] As you know, there is a significant economic 
potential in the Black Sea area, including natural resources. 
We believe that economic cooperation in the Black Sea basin 
will help the countries in this area benefit from this 
potential. We are confident that the establishment of lasting 
multilateral economic relations based on free trade will 
contribute to the prosperity of this area. 
  The chances for the success of the Treaty of Cooperation in 
the Black Sea Area (BSEC) affirm themselves along with the 
transformation process experienced by most of the economies in 
the BSEC countries. One has to bear in mind, however, that BSEC 
represents a long-term investment the fruits of which will be 
noted in the long run. Anyhow, there are already a number of 
short-term projects under way; the accords on their 
implementation have already been signed. These projects will be 
followed by short-, medium- and long-term projects in the area 
of transportation. 
  A problem we may confront is the one of identifying 
appropriate sources for financing these projects. Our 
experience proves that the true problem consists in presenting 
feasible projects. The creation of the Bank for Trade and 
Development of the Black Sea proves the growing interest of the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and of 
international financial circles in the BSEC projects, and it 
also proves that feasible projects may ensure their own 
financing. 
  Thus, if the private sector, the leading force behind BSEC, 
may come up with feasible projects, there is a great chance that 
they will be implemented. 
  Within this context, we attach particular importance to 
developing economic and trade relations with Romania. I would 
like to remind you that the number of Turkish companies doing 
business with Romania has exceeded 2,500 in the past four years 
and the capital invested in this country amounts to $30 million. 
During my visit, we will attend the opening of the 
Turkish-Romanian Bank. The results we have achieved in these 
four years should not be underrated. We are sure that this 
positive trend will also continue in the not too distant future. 
  [Oroveanu] Mr. President, would you like to address a few 
words to the readers of our paper? 
  [Demirel] As I have mentioned before, Turkey and Romania 
share numerous goals and ideals regarding the promotion of the 
well-being and prosperity of their two peoples and in the area 
as a whole. We have to continue to make efforts in this 
direction. Both our countries have large resources, both human 
and natural, supported by their attachment to the democratic 
ideals and the principles of the free economy, so that nothing 
can hamper the settlement of the problems we are facing. From 
this point of view, we are ready to support Romania by any 
possible means. We wish the Romanian people success in 
fulfilling their aspirations.

  [Text] A joint news conference by Turkish President 
Suleyman Demirel and Romanian President Ion Iliescu started this 
morning at 0830 at Cotroceni Palace to mark the conclusion of 
the state visit by the Turkish president to our country. 
  During the conference the two presidents stressed their 
common wish to develop bilateral relations in all areas and 
stressed that a climate of mutual confidence prevails between 
the two countries. During Demirel's visit to Romania, the sides 
have examined concrete means of further cooperation, especially 
in the economic sphere. During the news conference the sides 
stressed the importance of cooperation in the Black Sea area and 
of next month's meeting in Bucharest within the framework of the 
International Forum of Crans Montana. 
  Demirel said that the friendship between Turkey and Romania 
does not harm anybody and added that it is most important to 
ensure stability in our countries and throughout the region. He 
noted that Romania and Turkey have a joint wish that, through 
bilateral efforts, they should contribute to the establishment 
of stability in the region. 
  Similarly, President Demirel wished to stress the extremely 
important mission incumbent on our countries, namely, to be a 
bridge connecting Europe and Asia. 
  In reply to journalists' questions, the Turkish president 
declared that he welcomed the U.S. initiative in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a way to stop the bloodshed, regardless of 
which sides might cause it. President Demirel also said that he 
did not understand the international opposition to having 
Turkish soldiers sent to Bosnia within the framework of the 
peacekeeping forces, given that this is a decision made by the 
United Nations. 
  In turn, President Ion Iliescu said that Romania will not 
send soldiers to the peacekeeping mission in the former 
Yugoslavia in view of the UN decision stipulating that direct 
neighbors should not contribute to the peacekeeping forces. 
  During the news conference the Turkish president mentioned 
that he had invited Romania's president to pay an official visit 
to Turkey, and Ion Iliescu had accepted the invitation with 
pleasure.

Ion Iliescu held a joint news conference this morning in 
Bucharest where they assessed the outcome of Demirel's visit and

<F P=106> [Mihai Mihailescu editorial: "To the Ballot, Folks"] </F>
  [Text] Indeed, the modern government party wants, from the 
bottom of its heart, "to bring about change, provided everything 
stays the same..." [quote from playwright Ion Luca Caragiale]. 
The rulers do not accept that the time has come for them to 
either retire or reform. They are clinging to power for the 
sake of being able to do their deals while they enjoy immunity 
and for the sake of power in itself. 
  The ruling party is at the stage of total failure: Failure 
at the national level, through a disastrous government; failure 
in the negotiations with its satellites, which want to partake 
in the government, but the Social Democracy Party of Romania 
[PDSR] realizes that, if it ever allows this to happen, it will 
be submitted to huge pressure from abroad; failure in the 
negotiations with the opposition, because the PDSR does not want 
to make any concessions and, as usual, it is not playing fairly 
(How serious can a political partner be, when it reshuffles the 
government at the Cotroceni Presidential Palace while it is 
engaged in negotiations with other parties for a new government 
formula?); and failure in its own strategy, since it cannot even 
reform itself for the sake of appearances. 
  In this situation, it is hard to avoid a collapse into total 
parliamentary incoherence. The satellite parties may withdraw 
their support for the ruling party or a group might split from 
the PDSR. Anyhow, if any of this were to happen, the legislative 
branch will enter into a conflict with the current government 
and government program. It becomes increasingly more clear that 
we will have early elections, which the PDSR fears so much. 
  In the case of elections, the confrontation will be between 
several political forces represented in Parliament. The 
extraparliamentary parties, except for the National Liberal 
Party [PNL], have been left only with their names. An analysis 
of the likely political spectrum of the future does not reveal 
any spectacular developments. 
  The Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania [PDAR] has taken 
its 
leave from a political position of rank. It tried to save 
itself through a merger with the Romanian National Unity Party 
[PUNR], which was a rather poor move per se, as the PUNR is 
going downhill. Nothing will probably be left of the PDAR in 
Parliament, other than the picturesque presence of [PDAR 
President] Surdu, who will run on other electoral lists. 
  The Greater Romania Party [PRM] can only rely on the readers 
of ROMANIA MARE, whose number has obviously decreased. This 
party will find it hard to win enough votes for another 
parliamentary representation, unless it allies itself with other 
political groupings. 
  The PUNR is moving toward a fiasco. What damaged it a lot 
was its bombastic jingoist attitude, unsupported by a coherent 
program, and, of course, the Caritas affair. The replacement of 
some of its eccentric leaders might save it, to a certain extent. 
  We do not believe that the popularity of the Socialist Party 
of Labor [PSM] is growing at such a dizzying pace, as it claims. 
However, it has managed to secure for itself a certain segment 
of the electorate. It might start growing if the party 
renounces [PSM President] Ilie Verdet and other leaders from the 
old guard, and if [PSM Vice President] Adrian Paunescu's temper 
could be somehow restrained and his skills at organizing an 
electoral campaign properly exploited. 
  The Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)] is 
relatively stable. Some of its electorate -- although not too 
large a part of it -- might nevertheless be drawn (by force) 
toward the ruling party. Anyhow, the PD(FSN) cuts quite a 
sympathetic figure, thanks to its able and young leaders. 
  The PDSR is right when it fears the elections, since it is 
burdened by the catastrophic Vacaroiu governance. 
Theoretically, President Iliescu cannot interfere and support 
this party. We are sure that he will do so anyway; but, even 
so, he cannot help much, since he himself is registering a 
decrease in popularity. 
  The grouping best situated for the elections is the 
Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR]. The people want change, 
even though they do not hope for miracles, and they perceive the 
CDR as the political force capable of making this change. One 
should also not forget the personality of Coposu [president of 
the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party, PNTCD], which 
is increasingly winning over the electorate. 
  As one can see, the major confrontation will be between the 
PDSR and the CDR. Of course, the PDSR will employ all its 
battle arsenal -- promises, threats, unfair electoral campaign, 
and particularly fraud -- since it is the ruling party that will 
organize the elections. In this respect, the CDR should take 
protective measures and not rest on its laurels before it has 
them. 
  Maybe the ruling party will realize at the last moment the 
extent of the damage that early elections at this time might 
cause, given the general misery prevailing in the country. 
Hopefully, it will engage in serious negotiations for a change 
that cannot be delayed any more. Otherwise, to the ballot, 
folks! Unless, of course, we are so hungry that we are going to 
faint on our way to the voting stations....

<F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu commentary: "Ion Iliescu -- A Person To Be </F>
Pitied"] 
  [Text] As our readers may know, forgetting about all the 
harassments we were lately subjected to by the presidential 
institution, on 21 March I went to the Cotroceni [presidential 
headquarters] meeting of the president with the directors and 
chief editors of the major dailies. I did that out of the sense 
of duty I feel for our readers. I had to see, with my own eyes, 
without intermediaries, what is happening with Ion Iliescu. Has 
he changed at all since his meeting two years ago, preceding the 
electoral campaign, with journalists of various Bucharest 
publications, a meeting I also had the honor of attending? 
After the conclusion of the recent three-hour meeting, after 
having listened to Iliescu -- who kept talking throughout the 
meeting, from its very beginning to the end, interrupting, with 
or without a reason, his partners -- my conclusion is absolutely 
clear: The president has undergone a radical change. Two years 
ago, he still had certain doubts. Whether to run for president 
or not. Whether to turn right or left. Whether what he was 
doing was right or wrong. Now, however, he has no doubts. Now, 
he is firmly convinced that whatever he does is right. He is 
firmly convinced that truth is on his side. He is convinced he 
is right with respect to the domestic and international 
orientations of the country, the political spectrum available at 
home, and, what is even more, regarding the way in which dailies 
should be run. The journalists, we poor devils, are coming from 
the trenches of life. We know everyday reality, we have contact 
with it directly, brutally, and not by way of briefings 
elaborated by counselors. We know, in detail, all the dramatic 
aspects of the current hard life in Romania. We know that 
everything is stagnant. We know that there is an extremely grave 
economic and political blockage. We know that prices are 
increasing continually. We know all this from the hundreds of 
letters and phonecalls addressed to us by our readers, as well 
as from assessing our own situation: The circulation of our 
dailies is dropping owing to the drastic reduction of the 
people's purchasing power within the great economic difficulties 
we are facing. After I had read the invitation sent to me by 
Spokesman Traian Chebeleu, in which it was announced that the 
president wishes to discuss the social, political, and economic 
problems of the country with the directors and chief editors of 
the major dailies, I thought that perhaps Ion Iliescu wishes to 
learn, in a direct way, from the representatives of public 
opinion, about what is actually going on in this country. This 
proved to be a vain illusion. It was merely an illusion of mine 
stemming from my conviction that not only in the case of 
democracies, but also in dictatorships, the heads of state feel 
the need to be well informed about the large- or small-scale 
changes taking place in reality. If for no any other reason, 
then just because the careers of all heads of states who have 
neglected this have ended tragically. In this sense, Nicolae 
Ceausescu is a very good example. However, Ion Iliescu did not 
want to learn anything from us. First, because he did not 
summon us to Cotroceni for us to tell him what we think he 
should do, but rather for him to tell us what he thinks we 
should do. From this point of view, all the time, I had the 
impression that I was not attending a meeting with President Ion 
Iliescu, but rather with the propaganda secretary Ion Iliescu. 
That is, what we were attending was actually not a dialogue, 
but rather a meeting (I must admit, with mineral water and 
Coca-Cola being served, and every now and then we were also 
allowed to utter a few words) in which we were given precious 
recommendations. On how to be more profound. On how we could 
become more polite to the presidential institution. On how we 
should cease to resort to querelle in the press. (This French 
word, meaning "quarrel," seems to be Ion Iliescu's latest 
linguistic acquisition). Second, the president did not wish to 
learn anything from us about what is happening in the country, 
because he is firmly convinced that he knows everything that is 
happening currently. That the decline in production has been 
stopped. That we managed to survive without foreign financing. 
That the Vacaroiu government is the best conceivable one in the 
whole wide world. How about the rest? The rest is nothing but 
malevolent things claimed by his adversaries. By the 
opposition. By the press. Recently, I discussed the situation 
in the country with many politicians. Not solely those of the 
opposition, but also with those belonging to the rulers. 
Throughout those talks, I have never experienced a denser 
opaqueness with respect to the signals coming from the outside 
than the one displayed by the president during our Monday 
meeting. All our attempts trying to tell him that the people 
are leading a rough life, that prices are extremely high, that 
the phenomenon of corruption is expanding, and that the state 
institutions are anything but open, were received by him with a 
sullen distress akin to animosity. I am quite certain that, 
while listening to our warnings, Ion Iliescu was trying to 
figure out to which occult, destabilizing force the speaker 
belonged to. Thus, after two years, I now found a person who 
has definitively locked himself up in the tower of his own 
truths. A man living among statistical figures and abstract 
truths, a man who is unreachable even by the slightest breeze 
from the outside. A man to be pitied, in a way.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] New York, March 29 (TANJUG) -- The first draft 
resolution on renewing the mandate of the U.N. Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR), which expires on March 31, grants only two of the 
numerous demands made by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman -- it 
renews UNPROFOR's mandate for an additional six months (instead 
of the one year recommended by Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali) and extends air support for UNPROFOR to include 
the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.). 
  The first draft, a copy of which was submitted to TANJUG on 
Monday, retains the insistence on the sovereignty and 
territorial integrity of the breakaway Yugoslav republics of 
Macedonia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina contained in 
Resolution 871 which renewed UNPROFOR's mandate six months ago, 
but leaves out the provision which calls for placing under 
Croatian authority the disputed 'pink zones' border areas 
between the R.S.K and Croatia. 
  The draft also drops the original insistence on the 
integration of the U.N.-protected R.S.K. into Croatia, and 
instead calls for a generally acceptable negotiated solution. 
  The R.S.K. has been proclaimed by the local Serbs in their 
ancestral lands within Croatia's communist-era arbitrary borders 
in response to Croatia's violent secession from the former 
federation and trampling on the local Serbs' rights. 
  The territory was placed under U.N. protection in the spring 
of 1992 in order to end fighting between the Croatian Army and 
Krajina Serbs. The step has, however, failed to deter Croatia 
from launching four offensives against the R.S.K. since, in an 
effort to enforce its rule there. 
  The draft also drops all reference to a demilitarisation of 
the U.N.-protected areas. Butrus-Ghali, reporting to the 
Security Council, pointed out difficulties inherent in such a 
demilitarisation, in view of Croatia's four offensives against 
the territory, and explained that UNPROFOR was unable to protect 
the Serb civilians. 
  The draft resolution retains the controversial provision 
that 
a full normalisation of relations between the international 
community and the parties concerned would depend on their 
cooperation in the application of a peace plan and the relevant 
Security Council resolutions. This provision has been 
interpreted in various ways, with individual Security Council 
members insisting it means pegging the Krajina problem to 
sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro). 
  The U.N. Security Council clamped sanctions on Yugoslavia in 
late May 1992 for the country's alleged aggression on 
neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina, where in actual fact civil war 
has been raging for the past two years among the local Moslems, 
Serbs and Croats. 
  The draft insists on a need for normalising communications 
and reopening the Adriatic oil pipeline, but makes no further 
reference to the Zagreb-Split railway or the reopening of the 
Zagreb-Belgrade highway, which is at present open only to U.N. 
troops. 
  The first draft ignores Tudjman's demands for placing Udbina 
Airport and the Dzeletovci oilfield in eastern slavonija, 
R.S.K., under UNPROFOR control, for deploying foreign monitors 
along Croatia's 'internationally recognised' borders, and for 
posting international border guards along the R.S.K. borders. 
  Although the haggling that follows is certain to be fierce 
before a final text is put to the vote on Thursday, it is 
already clear that Tudjman has been given far less than he had 
hoped for, at least in the first draw. 
  The part of the resolution that relates to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina 
upholds the Bosnia peace process and the efforts to reopen Tuzla 
Airport for humanitarian needs. 
  Bosnian Serbs have agreed to permit the reopening of the 
airport in that Moslem-held northeastern Bosnian town, on 
condition that Russian observers and Serb control be deployed 
there to safeguard against the Moslems using the airport as a 
conduit for arms and other military materiel. 
  The latest draft endorses Butrus-Ghali's recent request for 
an additional 8,250 troops, monitors and civilian assistants to 
reinforce UNPROFOR, and instructs that the necessary funds 
should be mustered for the purpose.

<F P=106> [I. Keko report: "Prosecution Calls for 14 Years </F>
Imprisonment for Fatos Nano"] 
  [Text] Including interruptions, the Nano trial has now 
lasted for three weeks since its start on 5 March. Tirana 
District Court, surrounded by police for every session, has 
called a record number of witnesses and has attracted the 
interest of the entire press. It must be said that the trial 
was held for practical reasons in two buildings, in the old 
courtroom on Kavaje Street and in the former building of the 
Energy Directorate. Despite the changes in both the location 
and the accusations, Prosecutors Qeleshi and Gjokutaj did not 
deviate from the goal for which they had joined forces: the 
conviction of Socialist leader Fatos Nano. The Nano trial is 
inevitably the trial of the year. Neither the protests of the 
European Parliament nor the noise of the Socialist Party and its 
electorate have influenced the trial. Rumors of a rebellion of 
the electorate on the eve of the trial were successfully quashed 
by the people's police, and the Democratic Party's propaganda 
did the same for the Socialist Party's propaganda. The 
Democratic side will no doubt consider the end of the trial a 
new victory over the old communist nomenklatura, because this is 
the language that has been used against Nano. In itself, the 
Nano trial is an episode in a prolonged series of trials of the 
former nomenklatura, to continue with the trials of Ramiz Alia, 
Hekuran Isai, and others. 
  Thus, the prosecution at the Nano trial finally summed up 
its 
case at yesterday's session of Tirana District Court before the 
bench presided over by Agim Bendo. Prosecutor Qeleshi read out 
the 27-page file and in conclusion presented his demands. 
  The prosecution demanded: "A verdict of guilty against the 
defendant Fatos Nano for the crime of appropriating state 
property and abusing his office for the benefit of other persons 
to the amount of 73,780,000 leks, and his sentencing on the 
basis of Article 62 of the Penal Code to 13 years imprisonment; 
also a verdict of guilty against the defendant Fatos Nano for 
the crime of falsifying official documents and his sentencing on 
the basis of Article 110 of the Penal Code to three years 
imprisonment. "A verdict of guilty against the defendant 
Sokrat Plaka for the crime of abuse of office leading to damages 
incurred by the state amounting to 73,780,000 leks and his 
sentencing on the basis of Article 106 of the Penal Code to five 
years imprisonment. 
  "A verdict of guilty against the defendent Robert Gjini for 
the crime of abuse of office leading to damages incurred by the 
state amounting to 399,390 leks and his sentencing on the basis 
of Article 106 of the Penal Code to four years imprisonment. 
  "A verdict of guilty against the defendant Hasan Hallko for 
the crime of abuse of office leading to damages incurred by the 
state amounting to 144,821 leks and his sentencing on the basis 
of Article 106 of the Penal Code to two years imprisonment. 
  "The prosecution also demands that the defendants be held 
liable to pay to the Albanian State Bank the sums over which 
they have been accused, under Article 155 of the Code of Penal 
Procedure." 
  After the prosecutors' summing up, the lawyers of Nano, 
Plaka, Gjini, and Hallko asked for time for their clients' 
defense. 
  Lawyer Perparim Sanxhaku asked for 20 days to defend Fatos 
Nano; Lawyer Ali Meta asked for nine days to defend Sokrat 
Plaka; lawyer Fatmir Braka left the time necessary to defend 
Hasan Hallko to the court's discretion, but asked for a 
sufficient period; and lawyer Roland Permeti requested nine days 
to defend Robert Gjini. 
  In conclusion, the court decided to invite the defense 
counsel to make their presentations in their clients' favor on 
30 March 1994. Thus ended the session, which began at 1210 and 
ended at 1305. After it ended, we turned to Prosecutor Genc 
Gjokutaj, who said that the prosecution's summing up was a 
synthesis of the evidence obtained throughout the judicial 
investigation and during the trial, which proved the charges. 
The severity of the punishment is in total proportion to the 
importance of the accused and the seriousness of their 
activities. The very serious consequences arising from the 
defendants' criminal activities must be taken into consideration. 
  Asked whether the prosecution would triumph over the 
defense, Gjokutaj said: 
  "We do not envy the defense. We are men of the law and are 
convinced of the justice of what we have argued. What the court 
decides is the court's business." 
  Mr. Nano's lawyer, Perparim Sanxhaku, made no press 
statement 
after Prosecutor Qeleshi's summing up. He said that he reserved 
the right to speak after the defense summing up, which Bendo has 
decided will take place at 0900 on 30 March. It is not known 
what Mr. Sanxhaku hopes for from this session or whether the 
bench will reduce or increase the sentence requested for Nano. 
The latter is highly probable, if one remembers the precedent 
of the journalists' trial. 
  In connection with the defense summing up on 30 March, it 
has 
been learned that Fatos Nano has finally stated that he will 
defend himself, but will he bring evidence to show his 
innocence? From what has been seen in the trial so far, Nano 
has not wished to enter into the details of the accusation, and 
this leads one to think that his speech will deal more with the 
trial's political ramifications than with its legal details.

<F P=106> [B. Prespa article: "Do the Serbs Have the Money To </F>
Colonize Kosova?"] 
  [Text] Recent reports from Kosova mention new Serbian 
plans to colonize this part of former Yugoslavia. Various 
figures have been tossed out to the media, testifying to a 
fiendish policy in Belgrade to depopulate Kosova by expelling 
the Kosovars over the border. Fear of a Kosovar exodus is 
present in Albania, especially in areas bordering the former 
Yugoslavia. Asked about the danger of war, the Albanian 
authorities mention as one of the consequences a mass exodus of 
Albanians from Kosova toward their kin-state. Nevertheless, it 
seems that the Serbs want to accomplish their plans without the 
help of weapons, as in Bosnia, but with the aid of money. ATA 
reported a few days ago that Belgrade had placed an additional 
400 million German marks [DM] at the disposal of Kosova 
colonists, with more to come. In the last four years, 120,000 
Albanians have been dismissed from their jobs and about 300,000 
have been forced to leave Kosova. These are alarming figures 
when one remembers that the population of Kosova is no more than 
2.5 million Albanians or 400,000 families. A simple calculation 
shows that every family has been affected by exile or job 
dismissals. 
  During the existence of the former Yugoslavia, colonists 
were 
brought to Kosova mainly from Croatia, Slovenia, or 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Now, after the destruction of the Yugoslav 
community, Serbia's scope for activity has significantly 
narrowed and the colonists that can be cajoled into moving to 
Kosova are no doubt Serbs and Montenegrins. It is thought that 
Belgrade intends to bring 600,000 Serbs to Albanian-populated 
territories to change the population's ethnic structure. About 
23 years ago, the Serbs forced the Kosovars to abandon their 
country and it is well known that hundreds of thousands of 
Albanians emigrated to Turkey under duress. As in the case of 
Bosnia, the Serbs consider the Albanians of Kosova as Muslims 
first and Albanians second. Nevertheless, their common 
nationality and language shared with the 3 million Albanians of 
Albania cannot be denied. Under the circumstances of the 
economic crisis that has engulfed the former Yugoslavia, where 
you need a suitcase full of dinars to buy a loaf of bread, it is 
astonishing to see mention of such astronomical sums, which 
could far better be invested in the development of Kosova. It 
seems that the Serbs invest for one thing alone: a Kosova 
without Kosovars. This would be the investment of the century, 
an investment to be used as an argument against anybody with any 
claims to Kosova and the 2 million Albanians living there. 
  If Tirana is also aware of such figures, the Albanian 
Government must protest to all the international organizations, 
because the depopulation of Kosova would have immediate 
consequences for Albania. It is easy to imagine what would 
happen if hundreds of thousands of Kosovars were to enter 
Albania, forcibly expelled by Belgrade. The effects of such a 
policy, if it were to be tolerated, would be felt by every 
Albanian family from north to south, because every Albanian 
family would have to shelter an Albanian from Kosova. The time 
has come for government propaganda to sensitize the 
international public. Solely through the speculations of a few 
itinerant journalists, Belgrade has accused Tirana of militarily 
preparing the Kosovars for war, while remaining silent over the 
DM400 million and other figures. Tirana cannot accept a Kosova 
without Kosovars if it thinks even for a moment about Kosova and 
the Albanians living there and if it thinks for a moment about 
an Albania different from the one we have today.

<F P=106> [Andi Bejtja article: "Right-Wing Albanian Nationalists </F>
Under the Royal Wing"] 
  [Text] The departure last October from the Democratic 
Party [PD] of Deputies Baleta and Kalakula simultaneously marked 
the start of efforts to start a home-grown right wing, which the 
blue color adopted by the PD three years ago would suit more 
than any other group. It seems that these two deputies are at 
the same time working to form a typically right-wing party and a 
coalition of right-wing forces, which may be the largest 
coalition in the next elections. The party for which Baleta and 
Kalakula are working has its natural roots in the National Front 
[Balli Kombetar], in Legality, and in the Property With Justice 
Association. Because the total restitution of property lies at 
the foundation of its program, it would be natural for this 
still unregistered party to form a coalition with the Republican 
Party, whose chairman did not hestitate to take part in a 
meeting in Shkoder with the "PD's right-wing outcasts," although 
he has still not publicly repudiated the old distinctly fading 
Republican-Social Democrat-PD coalition. An increasing 
rapprochement is also noticeable with the Cameria Association 
and the Association of Former Victims of Political Persecution, 
with whose representatives the two deputies meet, it seems, not 
merely to drink coffee. This is shown by the recent visit to 
Johannesburg by the right-wing deputies and Kurt Kola, chairman 
of the Association of the Former Victims of Persecution. 
  But what is the right launching on the Albanian political 
market? Parliamentary deputy and former Agriculture Minister 
Kalakula said in an interview published in ALEANCA: "We are for 
the immediate and unconditional restoration of all property to 
its legitimate owners. 
  "We are for the privatization of enterprises, especially in 
agriculture, forestry, construction, the textile industry, the 
food-processing industry, tourism, etc. 
  "We wish to establish new criteria for privatization, 
substantially favoring former owners, victims of political 
persecution, and employees, who will be given priority in the 
granting of small and medium enterprises on delayed repayment 
terms. 
  "It is not only the proprietors that have been left 
disappointed," Kalakula continued in his interview. So have the 
hundreds of thousands of former victims of persecution, who in 
fact also include the proprietors, who have also received 
nothing of what belonged to them. These too were promised 
"vouchers." There are also hundreds and thousands of unemployed 
workers and intellectuals on welfare. The people's strongest 
anticommunist hopes lie here." [no opening quotation mark as 
published] It is precisely among these strata that the Albanian 
right hopes to gain support. "I want to stress that these 
people are watching me, not as an individual, but because of the 
position that I uphold, which it seems to me reflects their 
aspirations." 
  Moreover, the right has come out clearly in favor of a 
nationalist policy, which is the ideological rallying point of 
the parties with whom they wish to form a coalition. 
Nevertheless, it must be said that this still undeclared 
right-wing front needs to create a single center that will have 
the strength and credibility to attract the fringe, which is 
often still within the PD's orbit. It seems that the two 
deputies are not strong enough to do this, and one of them 
cannot enjoy the total confidence of this home-grown right for 
the simple reason that he was once Hoxha's representative in the 
glass palace of the United Nations. In this resepct, the 
weightiest and most suitable figure, even though he does not 
speak good Albanian, remains Leka Zogu, whose political baggage 
contains nothing but the successes and failures of his father 
Ahmet [King Zog]. The fact that the heir to the royal throne 
himself is making overtures to the right is shown by the 
invitation to visit South Africa that Leka extended to its 
representatives. This also explains the current Albanian 
authorities' fear of allowing him to enter Albania. Thus, the 
heir to the throne, if he is allowed into Albania, may also be 
carrying the little banner of the Albanian right as well as the 
great flag of the monarch of the ethnic territories. This may 
be the aim of the home-grown Albanian right: to grow strong 
under the royal wing.

<F P=106> [Skender Minxhozi report: "Independent Trade Unions </F>
Congress: Explosion Averted"] 
  [Text] While the Albanian state was celebrating the second 
anniversary of the Democratic Party [PD] coming to power on 22 
March, the Union of Independent Trade Union [BSPSh], one of the 
country's two largest trade unions, was holding its first 
congress in the Palace of Congresses in Tirana. These 48 hours, 
expected to be a difficult test for the current BSPSh leadership 
headed by Valer Xheka, ended without any dispute among the 
fractions that have recently arisen within the trade union. 
Chairman Xheka confirmed his dominance by receiving 90 percent 
of the delegates' votes in the elections at the end of the 
congress. It might be said that what was expected to be the 
congress of the great split ended with the triumph of the 
present leaders, who will continue to hold their positions at 
the head of the first anticommunist trade union for four more 
years. In fact, the neutralization of the fractionist group of 
Valer Lubonja and Imir Kamba, the latter a cousin of PD 
Secretary Tritan Shehu, was evident on the eve of the congress, 
when their names were absent from all the lists of the 
presidiums that were to chair the plenary sessions. Their 
vilification as "separatists," "Red whippersnappers," and 
"gangsters" in the general report delivered by BSPSh Secretary 
Vilson Qendro, which provoked a positive reaction from the 
audience, then sealed the fate of the "rebels," whom various 
sources claim to have decided to create another trade union. In 
this case, we would have a reprise of the secession of such 
names as Gezim Kalaja and Sami Karriqi, who formed the 
autonomous miners' union. 
  The BSPSh's first congress once again underlined the current 
crisis of relations between this trade union and the state of 
Berisha, despite their one-time alliance in the struggle against 
communism. The end of this alliance became explicit at this 
congress and was justified by the trade union's need to continue 
its struggle to defend the workers' interests. "Becoming the 
tool of parties means death for a trade union," Vilson Qendro 
declared. He later accused the franctionists precisely of being 
manipulated by "certain political forces," without naming them. 
Vilson Qendro set out the demands on which the BSPSh will base 
its strategy in the coming years. These include stemming the 
hemorrhage of lay-offs, the linking of wages to the index of 
inflation, pension increases, and a social policy from today's 
state. Mr. Qendro criticized the government's indifference and 
arrogance in excluding the trade union from making decisions 
that involve social consequences for the population, and in not 
seeing fit to negotiate a number of parliamentary bills with 
trade union representatives. He went on to say that the Strike 
Law is in fact an anti-strike law. The tone of the speeches at 
the congress and the harsh criticisms addressed toward the Meksi 
government might indicate a reawakening of the BSPSh, which has 
so far been considered a body approving the Meksi cabinet's 
economic platform and reforms. 
  President Berisha, in his speech of greeting at the start of 
the first day's proceedings, openly stated that he had followed 
developments within the BSPSh, wishing to convey the idea that 
he continues to have total control over the trade union that 
brought him to power. High-flown and euphoric, the Albanian 
president said that he would act as a mediator between the trade 
unionists and the government and that he considered the trade 
union's demands to be fair, while he of course also expressed 
satisfaction at the phrase in the report expressing support for 
the reforms of the PD's state. He speech was an official permit 
for Xheka to continue on his path for four more years after this 
congress, which is time enough to settle in....

<F P=106> [Interview with Zhan Videnov, chairman of the Supreme </F>
Council of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, by Dora Chichkova in 
Sofia on 22 March: "Attack on Lev Has Been Mounted by Foreign 
Currency Speculators"] 
  [Text] Zhan Videnov celebrated his 35th birthday on 22 
March. He spent his birthday attending a four-hour session of 
the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] Executive Bureau and having 
two-hour meetings with Professor Todor Vulchev, Bulgarian 
National Bank [BNB] governor, and Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni 
Matinchev, and then found time to give an interview to DUMA 
before setting off to his next working meeting. 
  [Chichkova] Is the BSP leadership worried by the state of 
the foreign exchange market, and how is it planning to react? 
  [Videnov] We are seriously concerned about the lev's 
weakness. There are no objective reasons for the market to have 
passed the barrier of 50 leva to the dollar. The people and 
business circles have real fears connected with the forthcoming 
taxation reform, the price rises for energy and postal and 
communication services, and certain difficulties arising in the 
foreign debt negotiations. However, all these fears have been 
deliberately played upon to create a psychosis and to enable 
dishonest people to reap financial and political dividends. 
This can only be countered in one way -- by coordinated efforts 
on the part of the BNB and Council of Ministers, assisted by 
parliament, to create an atmosphere of security, clarity, and 
greater confidence in the institutions. 
  [Chichkova] Which circles have exploited the situation? 
  [Videnov] I am certain that the attack on the lev was 
specially mounted by foreign currency speculators. They have 
already gained hundreds of millions in profits. The worst thing 
is that some circles want this situation to continue, not simply 
to obtain fresh profits, but also to cause hyperinflation. The 
people who want this are banks that hold considerable amounts of 
bad debts, holders of large amounts of foreign currency (mostly 
in foreign bank accounts), and middlemen who have "blocked" the 
sale of the large state enterprises so that they can buy them 
for a song. And last but not least, there are political circles 
in Bulgaria and abroad that for months have been trying to 
destabilize the country. Everyone knows who they are. 
  [Chichkova] Nevertheless, is there a risk of hyperinflation? 
  [Videnov] Hyperinflation can only be provoked artificially. 
Neither the budget, the policies of the BNB, and the taxation 
system, nor the realities of the domestic economy provide 
preconditions for this. The measures that the Council of 
Ministers and the BNB should take are well known; I refer to 
strong foreign exchange controls, collecting the budget revenue 
to the last stotinka, closely monitoring prices and providing 
timely compensation for the incomes of the weakest social 
groups, and adopting a much tougher approach in the foreign debt 
negotiations. At a series of meetings that I have had these last 
few days with Ministers Georgi Tanev, Stoyan Aleksandrov, 
Valentin Karabashev, and Evgeni Matinchev and with BNB Governor 
Todor Vulchev, I think that we have reached agreement on what 
measures are needed. 
  [Chichkova] Is a cabinet crisis possible? 
  [Videnov] It can only be caused by factors outside the 
government, especially by irresponsible domestic and foreign 
politicians. Some of them want to cover over the traces of 
their deals in 1992, while others want to make up for their lack 
of action in 1993. The best thing now is to support the Council 
of Ministers and the BNB and not allow the sabotage plotted 
against them to succeed. 
  [Chichkova] What do you think about the insinuations that 
the country's salvation lies in a new cabinet, and a caretaker 
cabinet at that? 
  [Videnov] This is utterly ridiculous. The present 
parliament cannot produce a new government, and it would be a 
crime to restore the former cabinet. The only other solution is 
immediate elections, which would take us years back into the 
past. A caretaker government could only prepare for such 
elections. Anyone who thinks that this solution can save 
Bulgaria is an open enemy of the country.

  [Excerpts] Bulgarian dailies did not come out this morning 
and private radio stations interrupted their programs to protest 
the plan to impose an 18-percent valued added tax [VAT] on 
newspapers. [passage omitted] 
  At this afternoon's meeting the Governing Board of the 
Bulgarian Private Radio Stations Association decided to prolong 
the protest actions another 24 hours. Private radio stations 
will therefore not resume their programs until 0600 on 30 March. 
  The association applied for a meeting with Snezhana 
Botusharova, deputy chairman of the parliament, at which they 
will demand that VAT for commercials be abolished, this being 
the private radio stations' only source of income. Regardless 
of whether the meeting takes place or not, private radio 
stations are resolved to resume their broadcasts the morning of 
30 March but to pursue their protest actions in other ways. 
  Our local correspondents and BTA are reporting that several 
local newspapers and local radio stations in Plovdiv, Vratsa, 
Sliven, Silistra, and other towns in the country have 
interrupted their publications and programs in solidarity with 
their colleagues. 
  At today's meeting the Secretariat of the Bulgarian 
Journalists Union once more confirmed its solidarity with the 
newspapers and radio stations on the strike against VAT. 
  In a letter to the parliamentary groups, the Confederation 
of 
Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria [KNSB] also expressed 
support for the demands of the journalists on strike, insisting 
that the problem be resolved by 1 April 1994, when VAT comes 
into force. 
  Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov described the 
implemented 
threat of the newspapers to go on strike as a simple act of 
blackmail, as a method of winning compassion and [word 
indistinct]. Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov officially declared to 
journalists at the Council of Ministers that he is not against 
freedom of speech, that he has never prevented anyone one from 
writing whatever he wishes, but that he is in favor of everyone 
paying his taxes.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Slatinski, chairman of the National </F>
Assembly National Security Commission: "Bulgarian Foreign Policy 
Is Not Field of Infighting"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Bulgaria is following with 
great interest the events around Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. 
  The delay in recognizing Macedonia turned this country into 
a 
dangerous focus of tension. Bulgaria has no territorial claims 
vis-a-vis Macedonia. The claim regarding the existence of a 
"big" Macedonian minority in Bulgaria is absurd. For every 
normal person, the Macedonian Slavs in our country are 
Bulgarians. They share our past, language, culture, and blood. 
One century ago, the great powers coldly and without a drop of 
compassion cut a piece of living flesh from the body of the 
motherland. Today Bulgaria's first concern must be turning 
Macedonia into a state based on international law and separating 
it from the disintegrating Yugoslav space. By simultaneously 
recognizing Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina 
in January 1992, we provided valuable proof of our intention to 
conduct an independent policy and of our conviction that the 
countries in the region must have the same status and be equal 
and sovereign if they abide by the UN laws and norms. The 
statehood and free choice of a people -- this is the main and 
leading factor in international relations. When a country like 
Croatia, for example, is recognized, this is done without any 
qualifications as to what part of the population is recognized. 
The statehood of the entire nation is being recognized, 
regardless of the people's ethnic origin or the manner in which 
they themselves determine their self-awareness. This is an 
internal issue of the country and its people and the personal 
right to choice of every citizen. Refraining from interfering 
in the internal affairs of any state, Bulgaria decisively 
opposes every attempt to distort our history and every attempt 
against our national memory and ancient values on which our 
value system is based. Unfortunately, the statements of the 
Macedonian leaders now contain precisely such attempts. To this 
we could add the existence of certain articles in the Macedonian 
Constitution to which we object, and the frequent cases of 
anti-Bulgarian campaign in the Macedonian mass media. Thus, the 
coincidence of positions with Greece on certain issues is hardly 
an accident. It is a consequence of common concerns and 
interests. Nevertheless, Bulgaria does not undertake unilateral 
actions, such as the sanctions Greece imposed on Macedonia. We 
are led by the principle of trying to understand a position even 
when you do not share it. Now we are convinced that the 
sanctions by no means facilitate abating tension in the region 
and contradict our principle of good-neighborly relations. 
Greece's remark that its act does not represent a precedent 
(tacitly addressed at the United States) is a weak consolation. 
  Bulgaria strictly observes its commitments and will not 
retreat from the firm position of noninterference in the 
Yugocrisis. This is a clearly declared intention which today 
enjoys the support not only of the political forces but also of 
all Bulgarian people. However, I ask myself -- who could 
guarantee that, at a negative development of the events in the 
Balkan, a radically exacerbated situation, and direct threats of 
Bulgaria's national security and interests, Bulgaria will remain 
a passive observer? 
  One cannot make attempts against Macedonia, Bulgaria, and 
the 
Bulgarian population and demand that we remain passive and 
indifferent. 
  Bulgarian foreign policy is not a field of infighting, 
improvising, and behind-the-scene deals. Dispute everything, 
history always sentenced our politicians justly. At this 
crucial time, the cost of their decisions and choices is 
exceptionally high. Perhaps higher than ever before.

<F P=106> [Staff report: "Extremists Join Ilinden United Macedonian </F>
Organization"] 
  [Text] On 23 March it became clear that activists of the 
Union for the Prosperity of Pirin Macedonia [SPPM] have joined 
the illegal Ilinden United Macedonian Organization [OMO]. 
  The SPPM secretly decided in Blagoevgrad to dissolve itself 
and join the OMO, where it "could be more useful" in the 
struggle for the autonomy of Pirin Macedonia. SPPM leader Alan 
Andonov had already resigned. 
  The SPPM has about 1,500 members and its ideas are similar 
to 
those of the OMO. However, its independent activity was 
aggravated by the investigation of the regional security service 
and attacks in the Bulgarian press. 
  The organization gained some prominence when the Russian 
nationalist Zhirinovskiy visited Sandanski. Then it became 
clear that Ossetian Alan Andonov was the commissary of the 
illegal "red units" in Bulgaria. They were established in 
Sandanski in 1992 to protect the interests of the Bulgarian 
Communist Party [BCP] and the struggle against U.S. imperialists 
and bourgeois ethics. However, later on relations between 
Andonov and Vladimir Spasov, chief of the BCP Central Committee, 
cooled, and the Ossetian now embraces the ideas of nationalism. 
The SPPM supported the recognition of Macedonian, Pomak, and 
Slav-Muslim minority rights in Bulgaria, in accordance with the 
program adopted at the end of September. 
  The scandalous news conference in Sofia of OMO Secretary 
Jordan Kostadinov galvanized the most right-wing elements in the 
Pirin region. The one-man organization, Slave Makedonski, 
considered until now the chairman and member of several 
organizations hitherto considered moderate, also joined the OMO. 
On 23 March his newspaper MAKEDONETS carried the illegal 
SKORNUVANE (AWAKENING) as a supplement. Its previous issue had 
been confiscated for its anti-Bulgarian propaganda. 
  The newspaper, written in a mixed Macedonian-Bulgarian 
dialect, points out that from 22 to 24 May militant nationalists 
intend to organize an international symposium of the 
"Macedonians of Pirin Macedonia." The Initiative Committee has 
reportedly invited emigrees from Australia, Germany, and Canada. 
They were supposed to come with their pockets full of money to 
finance the symposium. The delegates will visit Melnik and 
sample the famous wine made in this town.

  [Text] The Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant will close down 
the oldest four generating units, which date from the time the 
plant was opened, in 2005. This was established by a commission 
of experts that completed a comprehensive analysis of the 
nuclear power plant with a view to determining "the plant's 
effects on the surrounding and working environment and on the 
health of the population." New units will take at least 10-15 
years to build, so the experts consider that their construction 
should start immediately. 
  The experts found that the incidence of lung, breast, and 
thyroid cancers is less than the national average. The 
scientists compared their figures with those for the Belene and 
Yambol districts as well as with the average indices. In the 
entire series of measurements carried out, they established no 
difference in the background gamma radiation levels before and 
after the nuclear power plant was commissioned. Measurements 
were taken throughout the period that the plant was in operation 
at 400 separate points in 46 centers of population. The experts 
found no significant deviations in natural and man-made 
radioactivity in the regions surrounding the nuclear power plant 
compared with other localities in Bulgaria. The waters of the 
Danube were found to contain no increased concentration of 
radionucleides resulting from fluid discharges from the nuclear 
power plant. The team of scientists confirmed that during the 
entire period that the plant had been in operation it had had no 
effect on environmental radiation. Specialists point out that 
the pollution from a 1,100-megawatt thermal power is 10 to 40 
times higher than that from a 1,440-megawatt nuclear reactor.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz by Grzegorz </F>
Lubczyk in Budapest on 22 March: "A Society Cannot Be Replaced; 
The Meeting With Prime Minister Pawlak Will Be Important To Me 
Since I Think We View Some Things Differently"] 
  [Excerpts] On 22 March the Hungarian president received 
journalists from RZECZPOSPOLITA, PAP, and GAZETA WYBORCZA. 
Below we publish Arpad Goncz's replies to questions asked of 
him by the Budapest correspondent for our newspaper. 
  [Lubczyk] The political and economic transformations which 
the countries of East and Central Europe are going through are a 
remarkable process. According to you, Mr. President, what have 
we done with the freedom and democracy which have been 
reinstated? 
  [Goncz] The most important matter is that we continue to 
exist. That is a big accomplishment, both for the new Poland 
and the new Hungary; it is a real achievement by both our 
societies, especially when we consider the kind of devastation 
the Cold War inflicted on people. Despite that, we established 
democratic systems. In Hungary, we are getting ready for the 
second free parliamentary elections. Regardless of many 
reservations, deficiencies, and inadequacies in different walks 
of life, it is my view that it is not just us -- Poles and 
Hungarians -- that managed to adapt ourselves to the changes by 
gradually getting rid of the mentality which was in effect for 
decades. In my view, that process of adaptation to the new 
situation, and also of replacing the old way of thinking with a 
completely new one, is the essence of democracy. Of course, the 
process has not been completed yet and it continues to be very 
difficult; it requires constant sacrifices by people even though 
they are already very tired of the reforms and of modernization. 
  Despite that, I think that our two societies have a more 
optimistic vision of the future than Western societies; this is 
a result of complicated and often tragic history and national 
experiences. Perhaps this will sound a bit presumptuous, but 
there is nobody that has been -- and still is -- affected more 
by every tick of the clock both in the West and in the East than 
Poles and Hungarians. That is one of the justifications for why 
we should stick together. 
  [Lubczyk] According to what you are saying, Mr. President, 
our two countries continue to go their ways. The elections in 
Poland changed the political configuration there, and new forces 
have taken over power in the Slovak Republic. How do you 
explain this turn to the left? 
  [Goncz] I would rather not answer this question before the 
elections in my country since some political parties could 
immediately accuse me of making suggestions. As president, I 
cannot deal with fortune telling. I will gladly address the 
issue at the end of May. 
  [Lubczyk] So I will ask you at that point for additional 
explanations and supplementary information, but right now I 
suggest we just skip Hungary in our discussion. 
  [Goncz] The turn to the left can be explained relatively 
easily. The phenomenon is also visible in the West, although in 
slightly different proportions. After the euphoria and some 
achievements, there occurred a crisis linked to the recession, 
and societies simply hold it against the governing parties that 
they are not capable of handling these problems. After all, new 
authorities in postcommunist countries started off under tragic 
conditions in many cases. What the first democratic governments 
attempted to do, can even be compared to ... an attempt to 
commit suicide. Often we are waging battles with the 
impossible. While being extremely determined, we expect 
outright miracles to happen! Of course, there is always a 
chance to do something. I am not saying miracles do not happen, 
but possibilities and chances must be evaluated realistically. 
  Under this very complicated social and economic situation of 
individual countries, those who are in power right now must 
continue to keep in mind that they are the last persons in the 
world who could afford to ignore any principle of democracy and 
that they must always take the people's will into account, and 
to regard what society wants -- and not the authorities -- as 
the most important thing. Every government can be replaced, but 
societies and people cannot. [passage omitted] 
  [Lubczyk] After a few years of experience, what is your 
evaluation of the president's place and role in establishing 
democracy in Hungary? 
  [Goncz] Hungary's president has very limited powers. 
Personally, I often find myself in awkward situations since 
people tend to generally believe me and rely on me, whereas in 
actual fact there is not a lot I can really do. So I think very 
carefully about every word I say. It is a paradox that you are 
hearing this from a writer, but only now have I come to really 
appreciate the power of words. 
  [Lubczyk] Do you think that the powers of the "head of 
state" should be amended? 
  [Goncz] I think I have no right to discuss the issue. Let 
the political parties and society speak about this if they think 
that is the right thing to do. I think that if a debate like 
this were to take place, I should not participate in it. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Lubczyk] Mr. President, how do you intend to utilize the 
meetings with representatives of Polish authorities? 
  [Goncz] If I were going to Portugal or to Latin America, 
then I could say that I am going there to make a "breakthrough" 
with regard to this or that. But when it comes to Poland and 
its people, that is a completely different story. I think that 
being on the outside, as it were -- and also, I think, having 
quite a good knowledge of Poland's historical and contemporary 
winding roads -- I view your current problems in a slightly 
different way than yourselves. And vice versa. I expect to 
find answers to many questions during my talks with President 
Walesa and with many other Polish politicians -- and also with 
other kinds of people, by the way. Among others, my meeting 
with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak will be significant to me 
since I think that we view some issues differently. I am sure 
the current visit will also be helpful to President Lech Walesa 
and myself so as to better prepare ourselves for the April 
meeting of the "heads" of seven countries. 
  [Lubczyk] What are politics to you? 
  [Goncz] Politics is not an isolated term to me. I always 
view politics from the perspective of society and through 
people's behaviors and responses, among others to reforms being 
introduced. Politics is a way to make life better.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Democratic Forum Deputy Gyorgy </F>
Csoti by correspondent Miklos Keleti; place and date not given; 
from the "Foreign Political Observer" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Keleti] The MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] 
has government experience; it has played a determining role in 
the shaping and implementation of foreign policy in the past 
four years. If it finds itself in the same situation in the next 
four years, in what areas can we expect continuity, adjustments, 
or perhaps changes? 
  [Csoti] The electors can expect continuity, primarily in 
foreign policy. We plan to continue the foreign policy that 
bears the stamp of Jozsef Antall, adapted naturally to the given 
circumstance -- because the world is changing in the meantime -- 
and eliminating the minor mistakes that we made during the four 
years of government, because we naturally were not perfect. 
  However, there will be no change in the main line: The 
basic, 
determining factors in Hungarian foreign policy are to join the 
process of European integration and the handling -- and solution 
where possible -- of the vital issues of Hungarians beyond the 
borders, naturally in coordination with the good relations to be 
shaped with neighboring countries. 
  [Keleti] Let us look more closely at the individual areas, 
including integration with Western Europe. We will soon 
officially submit our accession application to the European 
Union [EU]. We know that this in effect could be on the agenda 
in around 1996 or 1997. What aims does the MDF have in this 
area until then? 
  [Csoti] Many things must be done concerning the further 
development of relations with the EU countries. Many things 
must be done here in Hungary so that we catch up economically, 
so that we adapt our legal system to the European norms. So 
there is plenty to do. [passage omitted] 
  There are members of the [European] family, primarily 
Mediterranean countries, whose economy is not much stronger than 
ours. For this reason, we expect -- and we have received 
promises to this effect from our West European partners -- that 
our accession will be a political decision, that having achieved 
the necessary minimum, accession will enable us to be part of 
the system of European integration, and that by this they should 
ensure us the possibility of further economic progress. 
  [Keleti] The other sphere that is being mentioned a lot 
recently is our relationship, our military-security relations, 
with NATO. The situation has become somewhat clearer with the 
announcement of Partnership for Peace and with the signing of 
the framework agreements on this. Nonetheless, what does the 
MDF expect from NATO specifically, within this cooperation, and 
according to the MDF program, in what specific areas must 
Hungary take steps so that there is closer cooperation? 
  [Csoti] What we expect from NATO is that within the 
Partnership for Peace program we -- and other countries in the 
region that are ripe for this and wish to gain this status -- 
should have the genuine possibility to gain full membership. It 
is very important to emphasize that the European security system 
must always cooperate with Russia and Ukraine -- because this is 
inconceivable contrary to them or without them. However, they 
do not even wish to be full members, and it is inconceivable 
that a considerable proportion of the countries in the eastern 
half of the region will become members in the near future. 
  For this reason, what we expect is that within Partnership 
for Peace, everyone in the trans-European [as heard] region 
should be a [NATO] partner, a cooperation partner, and the 
central European countries who have completed the essential 
phases of transformation and who want it should be full members. 
  [Keleti] The next big foreign policy issue is the place and 
role -- in diplomacy -- of the Hungarians [magyarsag] beyond the 
borders. Let us begin with Vojvodina, since the situation there 
is special because of the southern Slav conflict. It has been 
raised recently that a conflict, a conflict of interests could 
develop between our rapprochement to NATO and the protection of 
the interests of the Hungarians there. What do we expect in the 
future, and what does the MDF wish to do in order to avoid such 
situations? 
  [Csoti] I do not think that this would mean a conflict. 
Indeed, I say the opposite. For example, the fact that Hungary 
-- together with some other central European countries -- might 
at a given moment be a member of NATO and a few neighbors of 
ours might not, would not endanger the given country and would 
not (?give rise) to tension between the given neighboring 
country and us, since it is important for the neighboring 
country, in the present case Serbia, that there should be 
stability and security in the region. The wider the area 
embraced by NATO -- thereby strengthening NATO and stability in 
the region -- the more it should be in interest of Serbia, if it 
wants a peaceful and stable Europe, trusting that the war there 
will come to an end as soon as possible, that the situation 
there will be normalized, and that the other countries of the 
region could take a similar path. 
  Therefore, I do not believe there is such a problem there, 
nor do I believe there is any vis-a-vis Romania or other 
countries. The theory -- which the Socialists represent and, I 
do not wish to speak on their behalf but they say this everyday 
-- that Hungary should enter NATO together with all of its 
neighbors is not realistic. If Hungary, and let us say, 
Slovakia, Austria, and Slovenia, as four potential, aspiring 
countries were to be excluded [from NATO membership], this would 
have a detrimental impact on us, on the region, and it would not 
help at all. Indeed, to the contrary, by perhaps increasing 
instability it would impair Romanian and Serbian interests as 
well. 
  [Keleti] Concerning the question of autonomy: One often 
feels that when this question is raised in Hungary and in the 
neighboring states, let us say Romania or Slovakia, it is 
approached on the basis of entirely different viewpoints, 
entirely different ways of thinking. There, it is regarded as 
provocation against the nation-state; we regard it -- autonomy 
for the minorities -- as a natural application of European 
thinking, European legal-political norms. [passage omitted] Is 
there any chance of hoping for psychological bridge-building, 
rapprochement? This is one factor among many. 
  [Csoti] It is definitely possible and necessary. I believe 
that it is an indispensable condition for finding a solution. 
These two neighboring countries [Romania and Slovakia] must 
come to terms with the fact that the peoples, ethnic groups.... 
[brief break in reception] Right cannot be applied selectively. 
An over 2-million-strong ethnic group or a 700,000-strong 
ethnic group, nation -- because the expression co-nation could 
also be applied to them in the given country -- is entitled to 
the same rights as those of the majority nation. 
  Regarding the psychological factor: A historical 
reconciliation would be necessary, where there was a 
precondition that we should fully grasp one another's problems 
and ways of thinking, that we should have empathy with one 
another. 
  If the Slovaks and the Romanians try to grasp fully the 
Hungarian situation, what Trianon meant for us, what the 
traumas, the historical blows to this country during various 
dictatorships meant, and that it has not been possible to 
recover from these to this very day, then obviously there will 
be a rapprochement between us. 
  However, we must also imagine ourselves, for example, in the 
situation of the Slovaks, who did not have an independent state 
for centuries -- that this as well is a bad situation, it 
influences the current political forces and public opinion. 
This is what we must grasp. If we jointly comprehend fully one 
another's traumas we will be able to understand one another and 
it will become clearer to us that we in this region are 
interdependent. We should not work against one another but hand 
in hand when building the future, the Europe of regions where 
the borders will not have any significance, and where we can 
prosper to one another's benefit and to our benefit.

<F P=106> [Nagy report: "The SZDSZ on Relations With Neighbors -- </F>
Economic Cooperation to the Forefront"] 
  [Text] Ivan Szent-Ivanyi, foreign policy spokesman of the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], discussed the party's 
political views in connection with the SZDSZ's relationship 
system in our region at a news conference on 25 March. This was 
timely in view of the fact that the SZDSZ's leaders had visited 
a number of neighboring countries in recent weeks and had 
conducted talks with leading politicians. 
  As Szent-Ivanyi said, the relationship system with the 
neighbors is one of Hungarian foreign policy's most important 
areas. For this reason, in their view, Hungary's interest is to 
have peaceful and well-functioning relations with the 
neighboring countries. However, in the past four years most 
problems have arisen precisely in this area, which has been 
partly due to the government's ideological style of foreign 
policy, Szent-Ivanyi said. Unlike the current coalition, 
although the SZDSZ considers it very important that the 
situation of Hungarians living in the neighboring countries is 
settled, it does not make relations solely dependent on this. 
  According to Szent-Ivanyi, new principles need to be 
introduced in regional relations, practical issues have to be 
placed to the forefront, and the interests of the other side in 
improving the relationship have to be made clear. During their 
visits to Romania, Austria, and the Czech Republic, the SZDSZ 
politicians found that interest was mainly shown in economic 
cooperation. 
  The SZDSZ considers regional organizations like the Visegrad 
cooperation or the Central European Initiative particularly 
important. Talking about the Visegrad group, Szent-Ivanyi said 
that in the course of their talks with the Czech foreign 
minister, it was said that Prague does not want ostentatiously 
to break off this cooperation but it has different ideas on it. 
Szent-Ivanyi said that, in their view, Romania and Bulgaria 
should join the Central European Free Trade Agreement.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Goncz, Horn, and Fodor Are Leading </F>
-- The Latest Survey of the Szonda Ipsos"] 
  [Text] The Goncz-Horn-Fodor trio continues to head the 
popularity list of the Szonda Ipsos Opinion Poll Institute. 
According to a survey carried out in the first two weeks of 
March, only three politicians out of the constant "players" on 
the list remained in the same position. 
  At the beginning of the election campaign, the public showed 
signs of uncertainty. The number of people who are uncertain 
about which party to support although they would like to vote 
increased from February to March, and so did the number of 
people who do not know which party might win the elections. Two 
months before the 1990 elections, slighly fewer people (58 
percent) declared their readiness to participate in the voting 
than now (61 percent), but then the proportion of people who had 
no party preferences was only 31 percent, compared with the 
current 41 percent. In the first two weeks of March 1994, 22 
percent of the people who are sure they will vote do not know 
which party they will vote for. This figure was 9 percent in 
1990. 
  The number of people who refrained from giving their opinion 
on politicians also increased since February. With a few 
exceptions, there has been a decrease in the popularity index, 
but most of the differences are statistically insignificant 
compared with the previous month. 
  In the case of two politicians of the Federation of Young 
Democrats [Fidesz], namely Viktor Orban and Laszlo Kover, and 
two politicians of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], namely 
Ferenc Kulin and Sandor Lezsak, the drop in their popularity 
index borders the statistically significant line. 
  Sandor Nagy, chairman of the National Federation of 
Hungarian 
Trade Unions, is again on our March list. He is in second place 
on the national list of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. 
His popularity has not changed since September 1992. Women, 
older people, and people with a lower level of education find 
Sandor Nagy more sympathetic than others. Generally, people who 
sympathize with the left think of Sandor Nagy more favorably 
than the average, and people who do not sympathize with the left 
think of him less favorably than the average. Consequently, 
Sandor Nagy is considerably more popular among MSZP followers 
(65 points) than among other voters (42-50 points).

<F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "The War Within the Romanian </F>
Intelligence Service"] 
  [Text] Since its creation in 1990, the Romanian 
Intelligence Service [SRI] has enjoyed a rather quiet life. 
This institution -- which was set up after the Targu Mures 
events [March 1990] and out of the belief that somebody should 
deal with would-be spies at work in Romania -- has not had too 
many problems to cope with over the past four years. Foreign 
agents do not seem to have tested its capability all that much, 
since the only danger for our "national security" brought to the 
fore by one of the SRI's leaders so far was the attempt of a 
foreigner to find out the secret of the pollution smoke from 
Copsa Mica by jumping over the fence of an enterprise there. 
The only difficulties for the institution have come from the 
independent press, which was worried by the possibility that the 
SRI might bring back to life the glorious methods used by the no 
less glorious former Securitate. However, even these 
difficulties were no big deal for [SRI Director] Virgil 
Magureanu's institution. The part of the press subservient to 
the SRI (yes, there is such a thing in Romania!) took care to 
present this concern as the expression of an attempt -- paid 
from abroad -- to destabilize the country. Relative harmony has 
reigned within the institution, since under the mask of a public 
appearance of softness, Magureanu hides his true steel nature. 
  Consequently, there has not been too much dissidence or 
rebellion against his absolute rule within the institution. The 
few instances when people dared to utter a word against him were 
dealt with in the purest Romanian style, by quietly removing the 
naughty ones. However, the SRI seems to have lost its 
primordial tranquility of late. This has happened not for 
reasons lying outside the institution, since the situation there 
seems to be good, even very good for the SRI now. After his 
endorsement by Parliament, Virgil Magureanu is no longer being 
challenged by the press or the opposition. His proverbial 
ability has finally had its way. Nor are spies causing trouble 
to the SRI any longer. According to Magureanu, they do not 
exist, because they have all already been caught. The causes of 
the disturbance come from within the institution. Some two 
weeks ago, the public learned with stupefaction (from 
EVENIMENTUL ZILEI) that Gheorghe Diaconescu, head of the SRI's 
Counterespionage Division, had been dismissed. No sooner had 
the upset created by this news evaporated than another piece of 
news took its place, namely that the SRI plans to dismiss 
Dumitru Cristea, one of Magureanu's prominent deputies. As is 
the case with all the institutions of today's power in Romania, 
the SRI did not condescend to give too many explanations about 
these two events that have taken place inside the institution. 
In these circumstances, it is hard for us to realize what is 
actually going on in one of the basic organizations for 
Romania's national security. Is there a life and death battle 
being waged between foreign networks? Have the two events any 
connection at all with the uncovering of a KGB spy within the 
CIA? Does Virgil Magureanu want to remove the people of a much 
stronger adversary, who is placed in the structures of the 
current power? Are the various accusations that one hears 
against Gheorghe Diaconescu and Dumitru Cristea true? Or are 
they pure SRI fabrications? What is certain is that the SRI is 
going through a crisis and the crisis is so big that it cannot 
be contained within the institution and has quickly become 
public knowledge. This is an indication that the confrontation 
between Magureanu and some people within the SRI has become a 
life and death affair. The sacked general Gheorghe Diaconescu 
does not seem to have come to terms with his fate. Despite the 
drastic measures taken by Magureanu, it is more than certain 
that protegees of the dismissed general are still left within 
the SRI. These are not people that give up easily. Even though 
they are not doing so directly, they are probably acting against 
the SRI director. Threatened with dismissal, Cristea is 
fighting hard to prevent it. For the time being, the war is 
being waged at the level of mere press statements. However, 
nobody can guarantee that they will stay put at that level. The 
struggle might also reach the stage of released documents and 
compromising disclosures. Therefore, one can proceed from the 
assumption that the SRI is undergoing a major upheaval, which 
may seriously affect the ability to function of this vital 
institution for the country. Who will put an end to this strife? 
Looking at all the other bodies of power, we realize with 
concern that there is nobody who can bring peace to the SRI. 
Consequently, all that is left for us to do is to watch 
helplessly the unfolding of this war, which currently poses a 
greater danger for us all than the entire political and economic 
crisis.

  [Text] In an interview granted to our reporters today, 
sociology expert Alin Teodorescu commented on the results of the 
first public opinion poll conducted by the Institute for 
Marketing and Public Opinion Polling within the program [words 
indistinct] 1994. 
  The areas surveyed by the poll were political options, the 
popularity and notoriety of the principal Romanian political 
personalities, the standard of living and quality of life, the 
economic and social policy of the government, and mass media 
consumption. 
  The poll was conducted among a representative sample of 
1,100 
persons with a margin of error of 3 percent. 
  The question referring to the direction in which our country 
is heading is a question that is usually included in all 
questionnaires examining the current problems of countries and 
it is meant to establish the mood among the population at the 
time of the poll. 
  In the years 1990, 1991, and 1992, Romania seemed to be the 
most optimistic country in the world, as 70-80 percent of the 
population believed that the country was heading in a very good 
direction. Currently, things seem to be getting back to normal, 
Teodorescu emphasized, as, according to international standards, 
it is normal that the majority of the population should be 
dissatisfied. 
  Regarding the quality of life, the things the Romanians are 
dissatisfied about are quite clear, and they refer to the lack 
of cleanliness of streets and public places, the way in which 
local administration bodies exert their duties, the level of 
incomes, and political life. In that context, the performance 
of Parliament and the government are considered to be very low. 
  Referring to the mass media, Teodorescu said that there is 
only one daily that really has a nationwide circulation, 
covering the whole territory, and that is EVENIMENTUL ZILEI. 
Local dailies rank second. The publications further down the 
list are ADEVARUL, ROMANIA LIBERA, and GAZETA SPORTURILOR. The 
first channel of the Romanian Television has an audience of 85 
percent. The first channel of Bucharest Radio Network has an 
audience of 71 percent, followed by the programs of its local 
radio studios with an audience of 29 percent, and by the local 
cable television programs. Foreign radio networks and private 
radio networks have not gained as much in popularity as was 
expected. 
  Regarding the popularity of political personalities, for the 
first time ever the Emil Constantinescu [Democratic Convention 
of Romania chairman]-[President] Ion Iliescu twosome has been 
surpassed in popularity by the speaker of the Chamber of 
Deputies, Adrian Nastase, who was favored by 55 percent of the 
persons polled. He is followed by Emil Constantinescu with 45 
percent, President Ion Iliescu with 44 percent, Petre Roman 
[Democratic Party-National Salvation Front chairman] with 41 
percent, Corneliu Coposu [National Peasant Christian-Democratic 
Party chairman] with 39 percent, and [Civic Alliance Party 
Chairman] Nicolae Manolescu with 33 percent. 
  Regarding the political parties for which the persons polled 
would cast their votes, the parties belonging to the Democratic 
Convention of Romania are heading the list with 37 percent, 
followed by the Social Democracy Party of Romania with 24 
percent, and the National Romanian Unity Party with 6 percent. 
The question intended to establish the polled persons' 
readiness to participate in an election was answered 
affirmatively by 80 percent, which proves that there is an 
interest in political life and a conviction that voting is 
important for the way Romania will look in the future.

<F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "Ion Iliescu Has Fallen From the </F>
Top of the List"] 
  [Excerpts] The TINERETUL LIBER daily, which has been 
issued in a new format today, publishes the latest opinion poll 
of the IRSOP [Romanian Institute for Public Opinion Poll] on the 
issue of the population's electoral options. The major 
conclusion of the opinion poll is really sensational: For the 
first time since December 1989, Ion Iliescu cedes the top place 
that he has held in the electoral sympathy to another 
politician, who is none other than Ion Iliescu's former 
adversary in the September 1992 elections, namely, the current 
leader of the CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania], Emil 
Constantinescu. [passage omitted] 
  I will only mention that, as a result of this recent opinion 
poll carried out by IRSOP, the perennial Prince Charming of the 
Romanian electorate, the person who won two presidential 
elections and has been the holder of the first place in all 
polls since 1989, is now holding second place, 10 points behind 
the first one on the list, Emil Constantinescu. This represents 
the response to the question: If presidential elections were 
held next Sunday and the same candidates as in 1992 would run in 
those elections, whom would you vote for? The IRSOP polls have 
always been suspected of behind-the-scenes games. At a first 
glance one might suspect such a game being played now. One of 
the means through which the Iliescu group has kept its position 
for four years has been to put the opposition to sleep, by 
feeding it the illusion and the feeling that it has become 
victorious. This is precisely what happened for example shortly 
before the September 1992 elections, when the opposition, 
intoxicated -- in a shrewd manner -- with the prospects of 
indisputable triumph, slackened the intensity of its electoral 
actions. It is clear that the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of 
Romania] is preparing for early elections. However, considering 
that the open and brave confrontation is not one of this party's 
habits, the moment of provoking elections has been postponed. 
All this time, the PDSR will be able to carry out its activity 
of fighting political adversaries using state money, without 
anybody being able to accuse it of violating the provisions of 
the electoral law. The IRSOP poll could be regarded as a simple 
maneuver meant to appease the vigilance of the opposition by 
creating the illusion that the PDSR and Ion Iliescu have already 
been knocked out. However, at a closer glance -- which would 
mean to take into consideration the current concrete social, 
political, and economic situation -- the fall from the top of 
electoral options is convincing. From 1992 and up to now, Ion 
Iliescu's political capital has not stopped eroding. He is 
losing his electoral inheritance at an incredible speed of late. 
The reasons for this process should be sought first of all in 
the dramatic deterioration of the daily life. No matter how 
strongly the constitution stipulates that it is the government 
and not Ion Iliescu who is responsible for national economic 
affairs, an ordinary person, less attentive to subtleties, 
automatically holds the president responsible for the country's 
disastrous state. This transfer of responsibility from the 
government to Ion Iliescu has been much accelerated by Ion 
Iliescu's lack of capability to play exclusively the role of 
Romania's president. His actions to appoint a mediocre prime 
minister who lacks personality, to send numerous recommendations 
to the government from Cotroceni [presidency], and to turn the 
job of the president into that of counselor of numerous 
ministers, have gradually convinced the entire population that 
Romania is virtually led by Ion Iliescu. Thus, the president 
has been and continues to be held responsible for all current 
evils in Romania, even those for which he is not guilty at all. 
  The reason for this process that intensifies the erosion of 
the president's electoral capital can be found also in the 
ambiguous policy promoted by Ion Iliescu. The president won the 
elections through a left-wing platform. Later, he became -- at 
least according to his statements -- a passionate promoter of a 
right-wing policy. Neither the previous option for the 
left-wing, nor the current one for the right-wing have been 
clear and firm options. Currently, just like at that time, the 
president is leading a paradoxical policy which we could call 
today a left-right-wing policy. This has made Ion Iliescu lose 
the sympathy of the left-wing electorate, without succeeding in 
winning the right-wing one. As usual, not only in politics but 
also in life, ambiguities and half measures, as well as the 
habit of hopping from one side to another, have to be paid for.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mirka Velinovska: "Season of Confederations"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Even if it is proven that most of the world's 
media have assessed the United States' and Russia's performances 
badly, saying that they only appeared to be participating in the 
settlement of the Balkan problems and that it was not actually a 
rerun of Yalta, the unavoidable conclusion is that the changing 
world has been caught in a contradiction. It needs a break to 
gain time and see where and how to go on. Forces are once again 
gathering, the process is reversed. The blocs fell apart, the 
problems that had existed before transformed themselves into 
mutant forms after the balance of the bipolar world was 
disturbed, and neither now nor in the near future will there be 
any efficient mechanisms for their solution. Therefore, there 
will probably be, if only for a short time, a return to the old 
tried and tested experiences. That is why there is Russian 
presence in the Balkans. The Russian Blue Helmets have been in 
Croatia, as part of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces], 
since the beginning of the mission, but they went to Bosnia at 
Karadjic's request. This was an excuse, they took advantage of 
the good opportunity. One of the political anomalies is that 
Russia has now achieved something it could never do before [the 
Russian presence in Bosnia] -- neither in czarist times, nor 
through ideology, let alone during Tito's lifetime -- with UN 
sponsorship and as a partner of the United States. 
  Maybe the world is trying to dress its ranks, to think in a 
different way, but it is a fact that it is still following the 
pattern it has shaped and that is the reason for us, in 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], 
to believe that all solutions are possible, and expected, in the 
still undefined political territory that is the Balkans. Let us 
not forget that Macedonia is not in the CSCE system of 
collective security, it is not on the list of countries with a 
ticket for the Partnership for Peace plan, the United States has 
frozen the establishment of diplomatic relations, and in that 
sense, all options are still possible. 
  What was the role of Greece in urging Russia to enter the 
Balkans -- practically at the gates of NATO? Logically, there 
should not be many reasons, but just take a look at what is 
going on: Andrey Kozyrev was in Athens at precisely the time 
when Greece announced the introduction of the economic blockade 
against Macedonia and not only did he say nothing regarding the 
blockade but, until the present day we have not yet heard any 
official Russian stance on this issue, except for its readiness 
to mediate in the dispute. Probably Kozyrev knows that there is 
already a mediator in the dispute with Greece; it is Cyrus 
Vance, and the new dispute is not a problem of a bilateral 
nature, but a problem the European Union has with one of its 
members, and it is not a dispute, but a unilateral declaration 
of economic war. Therefore, one gets the unavoidable impression 
that Kozyrev thought it was good that that Russia has now 
increased its activity on the territory of former Yugoslavia, it 
could finish its job and extend the zone of Russian interest to 
a point that Russia was never allowed to reach before. Even more 
than that, because "we and the Russians are Slavs," and 
moreover, we are orthodox. Russia has not abandoned its 
legitimate interest in Bulgaria despite the altered milieu 
there. Recently, in Bulgaria, as the concept of an 
orthodox-western division strengthened, a "concern about the 
possible transfer of the Bosnia syndrome to Bulgarian soil" 
appeared and the Muslim (Turkish) minority was mentioned as a 
danger, as well as Turkey itself, which is a sign that the 
Orthodox-Slav concept has its supporters in Bulgaria, who 
disturb the United States' interest in the East-West transversal. 
  Another subsidiary effect, no less important in such a 
strategy if it is applied to Macedonia, is that Russia could 
outflank Kosovo and Albania, which is totally different from 
having the United States outflank Serbia. Somewhat below, some 
200 kilometers to the south, there is Greece, a barrier to the 
greater ambitions of the orthodox allies, under the full 
protection of the United States and the European Union, a pet 
that was given a role in the blocs' world. It is very well 
thought of, and it has to be mentioned that it was well 
prepared. It is not known what and how big the contribution of 
major partner, the United States, was in all this, but that 
Greece came up with this idea is perfectly well known. At times 
through direct channels, at others through indirect channels, 
official Macedonia received signals of "attractive" offers, and 
as is always the case, they were followed by the threat that was 
it not for Greece and Serbia, Macedonia would collapse. Just 
take a look at the Serbian press lately, it is totally obvious, 
just listen to the statements of the Serbian politicians and 
"scientists" and everything becomes clear. Vuk Draskovic has 
already opened the season of confederations, saying, or better 
wishing, to see Macedonia in confederal relations with Serbia, 
that is logical for him. In BORBA of 22 March, in the report 
from Washington titled "Through Krajina to the Yugo-Basket" it 
was written that "the agreement between Washington and Moscow on 
Krajina is an announcement of their joint activity in finding a 
loose confederal structure for former Yugoslavia (without 
Slovenia, and Macedonia for now)." On the other hand, there is 
the view of Croat journalist Gojko Marinkovic that "a long time 
ago, the United States provided itself with a big aircraft 
carrier in 'Eastern Yugoslavia' called Macedonia." 
  That seems to be the crux of Greece's dissatisfaction. It is 
using direct, and other, means to marginalize Macedonia's 
position in order to return to other questions of top national 
interest -- Cyprus and the Greek minority in Albania, which were 
referred to by the contradictory [Greek Alternate Foreign 
Affairs Minister Theodhoros] Pangalos as even more important 
than the border with Macedonia, for which he recommended another 
policy, because the one implemented by Greece at this moment "is 
understood by no one in the world." This diplomat, if 
everything, is okay with his thinking machine [as published], 
which allows him to make logical judgments, as shown by his 
latest statement that "the border with our country will remain 
closed because the embargo is just and the reasons deep," but we 
should expect changes in Greek policy, as well as in the 
behavior of the people. 
  Whatever it might imply, it seems to me that the Europeans 
and the United States are rubbing our nose in it, just on the 
eve of Papandreou's visit to Washington, which has now been 
postponed three times, with a possibility of also being 
postponed this time. If an expressedly anti-American rally of 1 
million people is under preparation in Salonika, reinforced by 
the possible visit of John Shalikasvili to Macedonia at the 
beginning of April, the Clinton-Papandreou meeting will be at 
risk. In any case, the integral statement of Pangalos should be 
understood as an announcement of the agenda of the Washington 
meeting and as a presentation of two additional open and awkward 
problems in the White House Oval Office related to its zone of 
interest. However, all this does not mean that Greece has lost 
its favorable position in relation to Macedonia, or its interest 
in us. Pangalos should not be trusted when he says that the 
issue that his country has created is of a lesser importance 
than the ones he announced, or the ones he defrosted. It would 
be naive. Greece will still be engaged in marginalize Macedonia, 
but this time with the help of other means. An example of the 
directions of the "new Greek policy" may be the attempt at the 
European Conference on Transport, where it [Greece] proposed the 
construction of the Drac-Salonika-Istanbul corridor, with the 
aim of by-passing Macedonia. The proposal was not adopted 
because transport can not be influenced easily by one country's 
wishes, and it is of great interest to many factors. Even such a 
proposal does not give the answer to the question about the 
north-west corridor, which is as important, if not more 
important, for Greece. In this case, Macedonia cannot be 
avoided, unless Greece presents a reserve plan for a repeated 
by-passing of Macedonia -- that part of the road should go 
across Albania, Montenegro, and Serbia. 
  Concerned about how to make all its moves, our neighbor, it 
seems, has not counted on the simple fact that the United States 
will not easily give up its strategic interests and games merely 
out of friendship with Greece. Russia is also not a country that 
can be tricked. You cannot trade with it the way the "Salonika 
merchants" are doing, presenting the Macedonian-Greek dispute 
the way they want to, without receiving an adequate reply from 
the United States. The United States has -- just after the 
experience in Bosnia- Herzegovina, where Russia became the 
guarantor for Karadjic's Serbs -- announced and implemented its 
own symbolic additional presence in Macedonia within the 
frameworks of UNPROFOR. It looked like an extra deposit on a 
deposit for a certain territory. Moreover, reliable sources 
revealed to us that the unestablished, frozen U.S. ambassador 
comes with a team composed of mainly economic experts, therefore 
it is normal to think that the plan for a greater Russian 
component on our territory will not be possible for the moment. 
Nevertheless, we should not be lulled by this relatively well- 
defined Macedonian position. It does not mean that such attempts 
and definite Greek-Serbian pressures on Macedonia will 
disappear. In the text above we mentioned the elements of 
concern. Let us add to them: The world community, particularly 
the United States and the European Union, has not offered 
Macedonia much from its pockets except for its ponderous 
sympathy and respect. Not much has been left out of the decision 
that it was indispensable to provide financial aid in order to 
make some small compensation for the damage caused by the 
blockade against Serbia and Montenegro, including the damage 
that is yet to come after the Greek unilateral blockade. Here 
and there we can hear that a certain country eased its 
conscience with a couple of million dollars, in a situation when 
everyone knows your needs are for hundreds of millions of 
dollars. If that becomes part of the basket of preventive 
diplomacy that is now being exercised in our country, then there 
will hardly be any effects of the prevention if the citizens of 
Macedonia don't make their own contribution. In other words, the 
best prevention is ourselves and our awareness that this is a 
very dangerous situation, and a policy that will not help in our 
own destruction. Trade and the partners' balance of forces are 
on course, and we have no serious guarantees for the final 
outcome. If Europe existed as Toto Cottugno sang about it -- 
united and with strong national interests in each separate 
country member for the creation of a joint European policy -- 
that would be another story.

  [Text] Cease-fire talks between the delegation of the 
Republic of Croatia and representatives of rebel Serbs from the 
UNPA [UN Protected Areas] zones resumed at 1100 in the Russian 
Embassy in Zagreb. These talks, which began 22 March, were 
adjourned because of additional consultations by both sides and 
consideration of the proposals which emerged during the talks. 
  Today's talks are being attended for the first time by 
Charles Redman, the special envoy of the U.S. President. 
Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the Russian president, and 
U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith were also taking 
part. The Croatian delegation comprises Engineer Hrvoje Sarinic, 
Slavko Degoricija, Gen Petar Stipetic, Naval Captain Davor 
Domazet, Smiljana Reljic and Budimir Pleskina. The Serbs from 
the UNPA zones are being represented at the talks by Dusan 
Rakic, Slobodan Jarcevic, Mile Novakovic, and Aco Draca. 
  The meeting in the Russian Embassy is being chaired by 
representatives of the international conference on the former 
Yugoslavia, ambassadors Geert Ahrens and Kai Aide. The only 
subject of the talks, it has been announced, will be an 
agreement on a cease-fire and in this connection the separation 
of forces.

  [Text] Zagreb, March 29 (AFP) -- Ceasefire talks between 
Croatia and rebel Krajina Serbs resumed at the Russian Embassy 
here Tuesday [29 March] after a week-long break, with one of the 
co-chairmen optimistic they would achieve a truce. 
  The negotiations, the first since the conflict erupted two 
years ago, broke off on March 22 after failing to reach a 
ceasefire agreement. The talks were brokered by Russian envoy 
Vitaliy Churkin. 
  Kai Eide, the UN representative who is co-chairing the talks 
with European Union Ambassador Gert Ahrens, said: "I think that 
we will now conclude the cease-fire agreement and then we will 
look for the implementation of it." 
  The talks are aimed solely at forging a ceasefire between 
the 
two sides. The rebel Serbs have proclaimed a separatist 
republic, the Serb republic of Krajina (RSK), on roughly a 
quarter of Croatian territory. 
  Eide said the negotiating teams have spent the last week 
studying the oustanding problems. "We carried out... 
preparation on the ground and on the maps," he said, adding 
that there were a "few remaining issues. I think that it is up 
to the political determination of the two parties to solve 
them." "We certainly expect them to have that determination," he 
added. 
  John Mills, spokesman for the mediators, said after the 
start 
of Tuesday's talks that: ``the Krajina and the Croatian 
delegates, with a military negotiation team, immediately started 
working on the maps. 
  "There is determination (and) impatience to get results. 
This is an opportunity that should not be allowed to go by," he 
added.

  [Text] Knin, 28 Mar (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic, president of 
the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], sent a letter today to 
Butrus-Ghali, secretary general of the UN Security Council, in 
connection with the extension of the UN peacekeeping forces' 
mandate. The letter says: 
  Excellency, 
  The people of the RSK welcome your report to the Security 
Council of 16 March 1994, because you proposed extending the 
mandate of the UN peacekeeping forces in the RSK and the 
Republic of Croatia until 31 March 1995. This decision, with 
the involvement of the United States and the Russian Federation, 
will prevent further bloodshed and destruction. However, I 
expect great problems on the road to achieving a final peace, 
because the expectations intimated in your letter to the 
Security Council of 28 January 1994 have not been fulfilled. 
  At that time you expressed your intention of carrying out a 
detailed assessment of the role and functioning of UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] before the Security Council considered 
extending its mandate. This assessment -- although it was made 
with the assistance of command centers under Yasushi Akashi, 
Thorvald Stoltenberg, Mrs. Sadako Ogata, and all the UNPROFOR 
Officials, at least according to your report -- does not make a 
single mention of the suffering of the Serbian nation in 
Croatia, or does it condemn this UN member for its state terror 
against Serbs, which began in 1990. 
  You are well aware that the Republic of Croatia was the 
first 
to begin ethnic cleansing and that, according to your report of 
15 May 1993, UNPROFOR had registered, up until 18 March 1993, 
251,000 exiled Serbs in the Republic of Serbia and Yugoslavia 
alone. Despite this, in your latest report -- in Section III, 
point five, paragraph "d" -- you request that refugees be 
returned only to areas under UN control. In other words, the 
Serbs driven out of Croatian towns -- and at that time, on 15 
May 1993, you said that they were greater in number than the 
Croatians who used to live in the RSK before 1991 -- do not 
concern you. 
  In point six, you accuse us of having a different view on 
the 
UNPROFOR mandate, while we are only asking that the facts on the 
expulsion of Serbs from Croatia be registered in the normative 
documents of the United Nations, and only then will the UN 
Security Council be in a position to make just and unbiased 
decisions. 
  Your Excellency, 
  We have lost so much time and the UN has failed to identify 
the causes of the Serbian-Croatian war. Attention was focused 
on 25 percent of the territory of former Croatia which is now 
part of the republic of Serb Krajina, while 75 percent of the 
territory -- under the control of Croatian authorities -- has 
been totally omitted from your assessments. It is precisely the 
territory of the Republic of Croatia which has seen the most 
cases of ethnic cleansing, destruction, and killing of the 
Serbian people. The information center of the Serbian Council, 
a non-governmental and non profit-making organization, with its 
headquarters in 7 Safarik Street, Belgrade, tel. 3221 108, has 
discovered the existence of 87 mass graves. There, and in other 
as yet unidentified places of execution, lie over 14,000 Serbian 
civilians killed by members of the Croatian MUP [Interior 
Ministry police]. 
  Do not be astonished to find that peace is so difficult to 
bring about along the Krajina-Croatia borders. All you are 
considering is part of the problem, the one linked with the RSK 
territory, or, as indicated in UN documents, UN Protection 
Areas. Without an appropriate analysis and without making an 
official record of the fate of the Serbs expelled from Croatia, 
you are searching for a solution in vain, especially given that 
Croatia began its state terror, the expulsion of Serbs, back in 
1990. Croatia is the only culprit for the Serbian-Croatian war, 
and the only one responsible for the creation of two ethnic 
states -- the Srpska republic and the Republic of Croatia.

  [Excerpts] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman this evening 
received a film personality of world acclaim -- Branko Lustig, 
the producer of "Schindler's List" -- and awarded him with the 
Order of Prince Trpimir. [passage omitted] 
  Tudjman said: As president of today's democratic state of 
Croatia, I take this opportunity to apologize to you and all 
members of the Jewish community on behalf of those who took part 
in the Holocaust and enforced the Nazi-fascist racist laws in 
the NDH [the Independent State of Croatia, a World War II Nazi 
puppet-state]. At the same time, it is with pleasure that I 
stress the historical truth that the large majority of the 
Croatian nation condemned all types of that criminal policy, and 
many Croats took an active part in the antifascist struggle, 
including myself, who, as a young man fought for four years. It 
is probably not a coincidence that it is a man like myself -- a 
man from the ranks of the Croatian antifascist movement -- who 
is leading the modern democratic Croatian state, but neither is 
the fact that your hometown Osijek came under threat in our 
time, and its surroundings suffered the crime of ethnic 
cleansing. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, 29 Mar (TANJUG)-- Dr. Milorad Unkovic, the 
federal minister for foreign economic relations, today received 
Dr. 'Ali 'Abd al-Salam al-Turyaki, the special envoy of Libyan 
leader Col. Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi. 
  It has been announced that the cordial and friendly talks 
confirmed the hitherto good bilateral relations between the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Libya. Minister Unkovic 
stressed his satisfaction at the fact that, even in the 
conditions of sanctions under which the two countries are 
living, there is an interest and desire for the best possible 
level of cooperation. 
  Trade between the two countries prior to the introduction of 
sanctions by the international community was exceptionally 
important to Yugoslavia so that efforts to revitalize 
cooperation in future are an exceptional pleasure. 
  Envoy al-Turyaki expressed Libya's readiness to send 
humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia via the Red Cross. According to 
him, this is only a small symbol by which Libya wishes to show 
its goodwill and understanding for its old Yugoslav friends.

<F P=106> [Claire Trean report on interview with FRY Foreign Minister </F>
Vladislav Jovanovic in Paris; date not given: "Vladislav 
Jovanovic Considers Embargo on Serbia To Be `Major Obstacle to 
Peace'"] 
  [Text] A Franco-Serbian dialogue was officially restarted 
at the end of last week with the visit to Paris of Vladislav 
Jovanovic, the foreign minister of the "new Yugoslavia" (Serbia 
and Montenegro). At the end of the talks, in particular with 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and the President's General 
Secretary Hubert Vedrine, Mr. Jovanovic noted that by virtue of 
a "tacit agreement" they had not mentioned the events of recent 
weeks (the role played by France in the ultimatum imposed by the 
West on the Bosnian Serbs) and he expressed his satisfaction 
with the fact that France wanted to reestablish political 
contact with "the Yugoslav side." 
  In fact, since the United States decided to intervene in the 
search for a solution to the Bosnian conflict, starting with the 
agreement between the Muslims and the Croats, the French foreign 
minister has constantly repeated that peace would not come 
through a bilateral agreement in a three-sided contest and that 
the Serbs had to be brought into the negotiations. 
  France recalled the plan it had initiated and which the 
European Union [EU] had proposed in November which, in 
particular, suggested a progressive and conditional lifting of 
the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations in exchange 
for concessions from Serbia. It is on this aspect that Mr. 
Jovanovic is now insisting, stressing his disappointment that 
the EU had not "kept those promises" and expressing his hope 
that it would "again take the initiative" on this point. The 
trade embargo imposed on Serbia "is an anachronism," he said, 
and "a major obstacle to peace and its lifting is a condition 
for arriving at a solution." 
<H5>  Military Logic </H5>
  However, the Yugoslav foreign minister did not make this a 
precondition to the Serbs taking part in negotiations on Bosnia 
to which they are being convened by the Americans. He said: "The 
sanctions must be lifted completely in parallel with the 
implementation of a peace plan. If we conclude a peace plan, we 
must automatically start to remove the sanctions and they must 
have been lifted completely by the time the Serbian side has met 
the commitments it signed up to in the peace plan." He added: 
"If we do this, the Muslims will be stripped of any remaining 
hopes they have of winning the war and obtaining a unitarian 
Bosnia thanks to sanctions." 
  Mr. Jovanovic did not want to "speak on behalf of the 
Bosnian 
Serbs" on the Bosnian issue, and said that Belgrade cannot force 
them to accept something they do not want. When his opinion was 
asked as to whether some of their leaders, such as General 
Mladic who commands the Bosnian Serbs, are not opposing any 
negotiated settlement, he replied that Mladic "is a military man 
following a military logic," and that, as a result, his comments 
cannot be considered to be "official" on political issues. He 
added: "What counts is Radovan Karadzic and his closest 
advisers." 
  Mr. Jovanovic does not therefore speak for them. He noted 
that the Bosnian Serbs had refused to enter the Muslim-Croat 
federation signed last week in Washington, but, in his opinion, 
they remain "open" to any initiative geared toward finding a 
solution. He added: "The problem is that the Americans are 
inviting them to join the process without telling them what is 
being proposed. What they need is more details on the proposal 
that is being made to them." 
  Mr. Jovanovic would only (cautiously) discuss one of the 
points up for negotiation: the distribution of territory 
between the Muslim-Croat federation and the Bosnian Serbs. He 
reiterated that the Serbs had previously accepted to "offer" 
33.3 percent of Bosnia to the Muslims (and 17.5 percent to the 
Croats) and considered that "it is not impossible" for them to 
again accept such a partitioning after fresh negotiations. 
Without any doubt, Mr. Jovanovic will have met with the support 
on this point of Alain Juppe, who had declared himself in favor 
of this distribution of territory when the Muslim-Croat 
negotiations started, which in his opinion not go ahead at the 
expense of the third party. 

<H5>    Krajina </H5>
  Where the fate of Krajina is concerned (the region of 
Croatia 
controlled by the breakaway Serbs and for which Zagreb wants to 
reestablish its sovereignty), Mr. Jovanovic was again careful 
not to reveal Belgrade's strategy: "We do not take sides. The 
negotiations must take place between Zagreb and Knin (the 
Serbian stronghold in Krajina)." He moreover stated that the 
economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations on Serbia "were 
not related to the Bosnian crisis," although he added that, when 
asked by the EU, Belgrade had agreed to "make an effort" on the 
other crises in the former Yugoslavia with a view to the 
progressive lifting of sanctions. 
  Belgrade, he said, is ready to "aid in a process of 
normalization," in particular focusing on restoring 
communications, on condition that the Croats "do not immediately 
complicate" the issue by straightaway raising the political 
issue of the status of Krajina. 
<H5>  Hesitation by France </H5>
  However, it is this problem that the breakaway Krajina Serbs 
are raising themselves when they oppose, for example, the 
reopening of the Zagreb-Belgrade highway, provided for in an 
agreement between the two capitals, claiming they will set up 
border posts on the section that runs through their region. Mr. 
Jovanovic stressed that Croatia was only recognized by the 
United Nations after the decision had been made to send UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Force] troops into Krajina (the Vance plan), 
"that is, when Croatia had not established its sovereignty over 
the region." 
  Zagreb obviously disputes this version, basing its argument 
on other UN resolutions that assume that Croatia will retain the 
same borders it had in the old Yugoslav federation. France 
appears hesitant about expressing a clear opinion on this issue, 
which is again becoming essential to finding a solution. As for 
the United States, its position has been laid down if we are to 
believe the declarations made on Sunday to representatives of 
the Krajina Serbs by the U.S. ambassador to Zagreb: "I told 
them very clearly that the United States and Russia and the 
whole of the international community consider that the zones 
under UN protection are part of Croatia and that there is no 
possibility of a political solution which would make Krajina 
independent or a part of Serbia."

  [Excerpts] Belgrade, 28 Mar (TANJUG) -- Colonel General 
Momcilo Perisic, chief of staff of the Yugoslav Army, visited 
the military high school in Belgrade today. [passage omitted] 
  Perisic said in a statement: "Despite the economic blockade 
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] and numerous 
pressures, society's scientific research and military-industrial 
complex is doing its utmost to contribute to the maintenance of 
the necessary level of the Yugoslav Army's combat readiness. In 
conditions of the existence of objective difficulties and the 
lack of financial resources, it is thanks to the 
self-sacrificing involvement of scientific personnel and the 
consolidation of the military industry that we are succeeding in 
following contemporary achievements in the world in the field of 
armaments and military equipment. In keeping with this, the 
army's existing combat systems -- which to the greatest extent 
are the result of our own research and technological-technical 
potential, together with the rational use of military resources 
-- are making possible the successful defense of the 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the FRY. 
  "In the context of the further modernization of the Yugoslav 
Army, we are devoting particular attention to the air force and 
air defense, as well as to increasing the efficiency of 
artillery and armored facilities. The perfection of missile 
systems is developing in terms of increasing their range and 
military effectiveness, as well as in improving their guidance 
systems. As a result of all this, the Yugoslav Army, inspired 
by great patriotism, is in a position to confront any potential 
aggressor and inflict intolerable losses on him."

  [Excerpt] Serbian Republic President Slobodan Milosevic has 
praised the efforts of the brother leader of the revolution 
[Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi] to find a peaceful solution to the 
raging conflict in the region of what used to be known as 
Yugoslavia. From Belgrade, the TV correspondent sent us this 
report: 
  [Begin recording by unidentified correspondent] Peace and 
God's mercy be upon you brothers and sisters in the Great 
Jamahiriyah. Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian Republic president, 
praised the efforts exerted by the brother leader of the 
revolution to find a peaceful solution to the conflict raging in 
the region of what used to be previously known as Yugoslavia. 
  The president of the Serbian Republic said this afternoon 
when he received Dr. 'Ali al-Turayki, envoy of the General 
People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International 
Cooperation, on reconciliation between the parties to the 
conflict in the region, that we highly appreciate the speedy 
efforts exerted by the Great Jamahiriyah for restoring stability 
and security to what used to be known as Yugoslavia. 
  He added that the Serbs did not object to the agreement 
between the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovia, and they 
did not object either to the creation of a republics for the 
Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He pointed out that outside 
intervention and greed were responsible for obstructing the 
achievement of peace between the fighting sides for achieving 
their goals and greed in the region. The president of the 
Serbian Republic affirmed his country's stance with the Great 
Jamahiriyah in confronting the unjust coercive measures imposed 
by the imperialist countries. The meeting was attended by the 
secretary of the Libyan Arab people's bureau in Belgrade. The 
delegation of imams, preachers, mosque speakers, teachers of the 
Koran, Arabic language teachers, and teachers of Islamic studies 
this morning met Vladislav Jovanovic, the foreign affairs 
minister of federal Yugoslavia, which includes Serbia and 
Montenegro, in Belgrade. The meeting was attended by Dr. 'Ali 
al-Turayki, envoy of the General People's Committee for Foreign 
Liaison and International Cooperation, and the brother secretary 
of the Libyan Arab people's bureau in Belgrade. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Shefqet Rexhepi on a news conference given by </F>
Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova, in 
Prishtina on 26 March: "The Kosova Question Is Being Presented 
as a Problem Requiring a Solution"] 
  [Text] Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of 
Kosova, began yesterday's news conference by saying that raids 
accompanied by destruction and arrests, always on the pretext of 
a search for weapons, have continued this week in the communes 
of Mitrovice, Vishtrri [Vucitrn], Ferizaj [Urosevac], Malisheva, 
Istog, Gjilan, Decan, Kline, Podujeve, Viti, and elsewhere. 
Serbian repression has concentrated on certain communes, where 
there have been repeated raids. In Mirofc near Podujeve, the 
police also fired guns, while soldiers in addition to the police 
were involved in raids in the commune of Viti. Besides these 
daily raids, press-ganging into the army continues, and call-up 
papers are being distributed. In the commune of Gjakove alone, 
500 call-up notices have been delivered. Kosova Democratic 
Alliance [LDK] activists are subject to continuous repression, 
and the police also entered the LDK's premises in Kodra e 
Trimave [Vranjevac]. 
<H5>  We Have Our Stands </H5>
  The harassment of writers and intellectuals also continued 
last week, as in the case of Shaip Beqiri, who was sentenced to 
60 days' imprisonment. Reshat Nurboja, chairman of the 
Republican Party, was also arrested. The police also entered 
the premises of the Kosova Information Center in order to exert 
pressure against this very important institution. Torture 
beyond all measure is also continuing in prison, such as in 
Dubrave near Istog and in Mitrovice. 
  Dr. Ibrahim Rugova went on to welcome the statement by 
Denmark's UN military representative, who said that there can be 
no successful talks without the Albanians of Kosova and 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM], or 
without all the Albanians of the former Yugoslavia. President 
Rugova also welcomed the visit to Albania of Willy Claes, who, 
besides bilateral issues, also broached the question of Kosova. 
The Kosova question is increasingly being put forward as a 
problem requiring a solution. Willy Claes had earlier said that 
the 1974 Constitution [of the SFRJ, defining Kosovo as an 
autonomous province of Serbia] would no longer satisfy Kosova. 
  Bujar Bukoshi visited the United States this week. This is 
an important visit as part of the regular contacts that we have 
with the United States, President Rugova stressed. Dr. Rugova 
again requested that Kosova be taken under the protection of the 
UN Security Council. 
  President Rugova then replied to journalists' questions. The 
first question stated that there seem to have been reports 
during Willy Claes's visit to Albania that the West is ready to 
start talks to ensure the maximum autonomy for Kosova and asked 
what this meant? President Rugova said that there had been 
various proposals, but it is not a question of the West's 
position. As president of Kosova, I am obliged to act on the 
decisions of the referendum for an independent and neutral 
Kosova. We have asked for Kosova to be first put under a 
protectorate. 
  The next question was whether Claes had gone to Albania to 
persuade Sali Berisha to accept an autonomous status for Kosova. 
Dr. Rugova again said that this was journalistic speculation, 
while we have our own standpoint. It is a question of well 
intentioned proposals and not conditions or premises for talks. 
<H5>  We Have Asked for a U.S. Initiative on Kosova </H5>
  Replying to whether Serbian-Albanian talks are expected to 
begin and whether a starting point for such talks exists, 
President Rugova emphasized that this is journalistic talk. 
There are no starting points for talks: The starting points 
are the two sides. The rules of discussion demand that they 
should take place without starting points and conditions. We 
are sufficiently strong in our position to start talks with the 
Serbian side without conditions. Asked to comment on the 
Croat-Serb talks, he said that we welcome these talks, if they 
can reach an understanding. Meanwhile, asked to connent on the 
stand of the Yugoslav Government on stationing CSCE observers in 
Kosova, Dr. Rugova said that we have no particular comment. It 
is a matter of stubbornly defending positions that in fact do 
themselves harm. 
  Asked whether a special U.S. representative, such as 
Redman, will be appointed for Kosova, Dr. Rugova emphasized that 
we had asked for a U.S. initiative on Kosova. Redman is a 
representative for the entire territory of former Yugoslavia. 
It remains to be seen whether or not a special representative 
for Kosova will be appointed. 
  Another question was whether Rugova had informed the UN High 
Commission for Refugees about the expulsion of refugees from 
Germany and the question of Albanians under siege in Sarajevo. 
In this connection, Rugova stressed that we have informed the 
Commission's office in Prishtina, and it will no doubt do 
something. Asked about the secret meeting of the interior 
ministers of several Western countries about refugees and the 
demand to open the Macedonian-[The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] Kosova border, Dr. Rugova said that it is a 
question of greater, freer, and more normal traffic across this 
border. We have asked for the refugees to be returned via 
Prishtina airport, an idea that is being considered. 
  The measures being taken by the German authorities are not 
directed against the Albanians or anybody else, but at reducing 
the number of refugees in the country, which is much greater 
that in many other countries of the world. The German 
authorities will decide after examining the application of every 
refugee. The idea of using Skopje airport arose because it is 
the shortest route. Asked how many refugees will be returned, 
Rugova said that it is a matter of several thousand.

  [Text] At about 1500 today, Serbian police intervened in 
the Kosova Information Center [QIK] offices in Prishtina. The 
offices are situated in the Qafa complex of business buildings 
in Prishtina. Today, they were held under the continuous 
supervision of the Serbian police. 
  Serbian civilians, who first entered the QIK offices, played 
the role of uninformed citizens. Then, at about 1500, two 
plainclothes policemen entered the offices and took personal 
notes from three QIK reporters. 
  At 1510, four policemen entered the offices. Two of the 
policemen were holding automatic weapons. They ordered the 
reporters to stop work. Meanwhile, the Serbian policemen 
confiscated personal notes from seven QIK reporters. 
  The QIK reports that the Serbian police showed interest in 
the work performed at the office and left, taking the notes with 
them.

  [Text] Belgrade, 29 Mar (TANJUG) -- The radio of the Croat 
republic of Herceg-Bosna has reported that this morning Croat 
deputies refused to enter the hall in Sarajevo, where the 
Muslim-Croat assembly is meeting, until Croat national symbols 
are displayed along with Muslim symbols. 
  Ivan Bender, chairman of the chamber of deputies of the 
Assembly of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, told Croatian TV 
upon his arrival in Sarajevo that he would lodge a protest 
against the decision to start the Assembly proceedings without 
delegates from the Croatian Democratic Union of former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to Muslim Sarajevo radio, today's 
session has been postponed and will start at 1400.

  [Excerpt] Deputies of the Bihac assembly discussed the 
draft constitution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation at a 
session today. After an introductory speech by Mirsad Delagic, 
Bosnian government minister for regional coordination for the 
Bihac-Banja Luka district, and statements by the republic's 
deputies Adem Ibrahimpasic and Ejub Topic, deputies of the Bihac 
assembly praised this historic document and fully approved the 
proposed constitution. They also concluded that -- due to 
administrative mistakes -- a protest must be lodged with the 
chairman and the secretary general of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
parliament to request that invitations and documents for future 
sessions be sent to the Bihac deputies. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by "D.K.": "Karadzic: Greek and Yugoslav Soldiers </F>
Should Come to Bosnia-Herzegovina"] 
  [Text] Banja Luka, 27 Mar -- After attending the meeting 
of the Communal Committee of the Serbian Democratic Party of 
Banja Luka and holding a longish talk with businessmen from the 
region, Radovan Karadzic commented for our newspaper on the 
Muslim spring offensive and the sending of Turkish troops. 
  "The Muslim spring offensive has begun and their offensive 
is 
taking place along all lines, and particularly on the Trebava 
battlefield near Doboj and toward Kupres. This offensive must 
stop. If the Muslims fail to atop their offensive, we would then 
have to launch a counteroffensive, and then we are no longer 
going to talk about territories. The Muslims can get 
territories for their state through negotiations, but if they 
nevertheless decide in favor of fighting, then the factual state 
will be decisive, as we cannot give back the territories for 
which young Serbian men are losing their lives. Therefore, it 
should be clear to the Muslim side and the international 
community that it is either war or peace here. If there is war 
by the will of the Muslims, then the Muslims must pay the price 
of that war," Karadzic said and added the following: 
  "As regards the sending of the Turkish troops into 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, there is is another dangerous precedent 
involved here and I am afraid that this is the eclipse of the 
United Nations. I am afraid that the United Nations are quickly 
going in the direction of self-abolition, self-discredit, just 
as the case was with the League of the Nations before the World 
War II. If the arrival of Turkish troops leads to the 
escalation of the war, the UN secretary general and the Security 
Council will directly bear responsibility. We demand, and will 
do so officially, for FRY forces to be included in the 
Blue-Helmet forces. For, Russia is not a counterpart to Turkey, 
that is, Turkey is not a Russian counterpart. Russia is a 
counterpart to the United States, and Turkey is an interested 
Balkan country, so, apart from Greek soldiers, Yugoslav ones 
should join the forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina."

<F P=106> [Report by Esad Cerovic] </F>
  [Text] The Congress of the Serbian People in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina ended yesterday with the adoption of the 
Declaration of Citizens of Serbian Nationality. The Declaration 
asks the international community that they [the Serbian 
citizens] be included in negotiations on the integral peace 
solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Despite the fact that many 
assessments consider that the Congress should have been 
organized at a much earlier date, this assembly in Sarajevo 
marks the process of differentiation and a national awakening of 
the Serbian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It shows that this 
process is not deadlocked and it raises to the surface the 
question of whether the national feeling of the Serbs of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will take the form of the Bosnian Serbs 
journeying to a civic society. 
  Yesterday's Congress in Sarajevo answers this question. This 
Congress was the matriculation examination for the Serbs who 
live in Bosnia-Herzegovina, their "No" to fascism, primitivism, 
and national socialism. What had been halted by force and 
ideology -- as was evident at yesterday's Congress of the 
Serbian People in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- has come out of the 
shadows and offered light in place of darkness and truth in 
place of lies. It has also shown a tie to the Bosnian land and 
the desire to live with all the other peoples. Karadzic's grim 
ideology, an ideology of darkness, murder, massacre, expulsion, 
national socialism, was unmasked at the Sarajevo Congress, and 
the [word indistinct] that he represents all the Serbs in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was taken away from him. With this, the 
Serbs from Bosnia-Herzegovina have lifted to the level of 
reality their chance not to live at the tail of events, but to 
move on toward Europe, toward a civic society. The personal 
feeling of belonging to an ethnic identity must certainly be 
respected, and it will be. That is why we need to differentiate 
both in alphabet and speech. The right to be called Bosnian 
Serbs belongs to that part of the Serbian people that yesterday 
clearly expressed its political position. 
  To put it as nicely as one of the participants in the 
Congress of Serbian People in Bosnia-Herzegovina put it: 
Karadzic can probably represent only that part of the people 
that voted for him and that unreservedly support him, or -- more 
precisely -- the chetnik part, the part that sees the chetnik 
ideology as its own. This ideology has always ended up on the 
garbage heap of history. 
  Of course, yesterday's Congress in Sarajevo did not appeal 
to 
the [word indistinct] factory of lies. A commentary speaks 
about passers-by that were picked up off the street. However, 
in the name of truth, the Serbian people -- those who may have 
been unable to see this gathering -- need to be told that the 
following people actively participated and were present in the 
congress hall: Ljubomir Berberovic, Tihomir Berberovic, lawyer 
Zarko Bulic, Miro Lazovic [B-H Assembly chairman], [Presidency 
member] Tatjana Ljujic-Mijatovic, [Presidency member] Mirko 
Pejanovic, Dragutin Braco Kosovac, Mico Rakic, Nikola Kovac, 
Nada Mladina, Gavrilo Grahovac, Goran Simic, and Zivko Babic. 
Every Serb, regardless of where he lives, is probably aware 
that Dragutin Braco Kosovac, Mico Rakic, and Ljubomir Berberovic 
have far more distinguished reputations than the criminals 
Karadzic, Koljevic, and Krajisnik. 
  Theories that advocate the existence of (?worthless) peoples 
and states are wrong. Yesterday's Congress of the citizens of 
Serbian nationality struck a blow to Karadzic's theory of the 
impossibility of joint existence and his primitive nationalism, 
and this blow will send it to where it belongs -- the garbage 
heap of history.

<F P=106> [Mediha Colo report on news conference by Mirko Pejanovic, </F>
president of the Serbian Civic Council, on results of 27 March 
Congress of Serbian People of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Colo] President of the Serbian Civic Council Mirko 
Pejanovic first stressed that the reactions to the Congress of 
the Serbian People in Bosnia-Herzegovina were favorable, both in 
the country and abroad. He then singled out a few significant 
things pertaining to the congress. 
  [Pejanovic] The first thing is that the congress has shown 
that citizens of Serbian nationality who live on the territory 
under the control of the legitimate authorities and the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army are tremendously determined to fight for 
a shared life. They have exhibited this determination by 
participating -- together with the democratic and civic options 
from the Croatian and Muslim nations -- in the resistance and 
defense of the multinational and multicultural essence of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The other thing manifested at yesterday's congress is that 
the adopted declaration is founded on basic political aims that 
are incorporated in the platform and work of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency. The declaration reaffirms two 
principles of this platform: The principle of ethnic equality 
and Bosnia-Herzegovina's unity within its internationally 
recognized borders, and in this context, support for solutions 
designed to resolve the Bosnian issue based on the concept of 
the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Colo] This solution is considered optimal because it allows 
local self-management, regional and cultural autonomy, and joint 
institutions, the most important of which is the Council of 
Peoples where the vital interests of each nation will be 
realized, stressed Pejanovic, and continued: 
  [Pejanovic] The third thing I would like to stress is that 
the congress of citizens of Serb nationality was held in the 
spirit of efforts and demands for the establishment of peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Colo] Mr. Pejanovic then explained to correspondents that 
the Congress of the Serbian People of Bosnia-Herzegovina had 
proposed that deputies in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly who 
are from the ranks of the Serbian people draft an amendment to 
the proposed Constitution of the Bosniak Muslim and Croat 
Federation. 
  [Pejanovic] The amendment consists of only one word. The 
word Serbs should be added to the list of peoples listed in the 
part of the Constitution that refers to constituent peoples. 
  [Colo] The Serbian Civic Council will draw up its program 
for 
peace initiatives and talks aimed at finding an integral 
solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. One such meeting -- with Mr. 
Charles Redman -- has been set for Wednesday [30 March]. This 
council, together with progressive Muslim and Croatian forces, 
will contribute to the establishment of peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We shall also request firmer international 
pressure in finding a political solution with the so-called 
third, Serbian side, in which the opinion of the Serbian Civic 
Council will be one of the factors involved in finding this 
solution, said Mirko Pejanovic, president of the Serbian Civic 
Council, at today's news conference.

<F P=106> [Edin Nuhic report on a news conference by Muhamed </F>
Filipovic, chairman of the Liberal Bosniak Organization, in 
Sarajevo on 29 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] At the start of the news conference academician 
Muhamed Filipovic stressed that he was holding the news 
conference as chairman of the Liberal Bosniak Organization 
[LBO], legally elected at the recently held party convention. 
He said that -- instead of a central committee of the party -- 
a War Presidency was appointed at the first war convention of 
the party held last year. That decision was interpreted in 
different ways, making it necessary to call another convention. 
The decision to do this was completely legal and in accordance 
with the party's statute. The dilemmas about whether the Party 
Presidency had the right to call this convention had caused a 
political rift in the party. 
  Adil Zulfikarpasic stated that I betrayed the party, 
Filipovic stressed, adding: Those who believe that my 
involvement in the state delegation and my acceptance of the 
ambassadorial post in Switzerland are acts of betrayal, they are 
opposed to the independence and integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
After all, Filipovic added, the public is aware that my 
involvement in the state delegation prevented the signing of the 
partition of Bosnia. Therefore, to attack such a man means to be 
committed to a policy opposed to this. 
  The reporters reminded Filipovic that he had stated at the 
party convention that Zulfikarpasic in no way financed the LBO 
during the war, and that he had called in April 1992 on the 
members of the party to overthrow Alija Izetbegovic. The 
reporters were interested in why those facts were not made 
public before. Filipovic said that he did not want [words 
indistinct] Zulfikarpasic to give up on Bosnia, since he was 
still hoping that the latter would be able to offer some kind of 
help. Filipovic also said that it was not true that 
Zulfikarpasic had been trying to obtain weapons for the defense 
of the country, as he had been telling foreign and some domestic 
media. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and Government are 
acquainted with this fact. 
  Finally, in confirmation of Filipovic's statements, Salih 
Foco, newly elected deputy chairman of the LBO, added that the 
LBO committees in Tuzla and Zenica had been disbanded because of 
inconsistencies concerning the implementation of party policy 
and at the insistence of some members of the regional committees.

  [Text] Novi Sad, 28 Mar (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
speaker of the assembly of the Srpska republic, has described as 
strange the behavior and mediation of UN Protection Force 
members in most places where the Muslim spring offensive has 
begun. In a statement to Radio Novi Sad, he assessed that UN 
forces are attempting to calm the situation only in places where 
the Muslim forces are not having successes. "It is for precisely 
this reason that we have sent a protest to the United Nations, 
stressing in particular the examples of the battlefields near 
Maglaj, Bihac, and some others," Krajisnik added. He stressed 
that forecasts of a Muslim offensive have turned out to be true 
and he confirmed that Muslims are obtaining weapons from abroad.

  [Text] Banja Luka, March 29 (TANJUG) -- Forces of the 
Bosnian Moslems and of the army of Bosnian Croats (HVO) have 
intensified their attacks on Serb positions and settlements in 
the central, northern and western parts of the ex-Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serb military sources announced 
on Tuesday. 
  The announcement said Moslem troops intensified mortar fire 
in the region of the central Bosnian town of Srbobran (formerly 
Donji Vakuf). It added that Moslems continued using infantry 
arms, anti-aircraft guns and rifle-launched rockets in their 
fierce attacks on Serb positions on the western Bosnian 
battlefronts of Bihac and Novi Grad (formerly Bosanski Novi). 
  In the Moslem attacks on Bihac, one Serb defender was killed 
and the Serb side was forced to fire back, but it did not 
respond to the attacks on Novi Grad where there were no 
casualties, the announcement said. It added that on Monday, 
after 13 days of fighting, the army of Bosnian Serbs stopped an 
offensive launched by Moslems on March 16 and aimed at capturing 
the central Bosnian heights of Kupres. Bosnian Serb troops 
pushed the Moslems back towards the nearby town of Bugojno up 
north. 
  The Moslem attack on the Kupres heights, as the Bosnian Serb 
military sources said, was planned as part of the offensive 
launched to seize the town of Srbobran and later the town of 
Jajce. 
  The sources cautioned against fresh fierce attacks by Moslem 
forces which were redeploying themselves towards Srbobran and 
Kupres, moving in there their men and materiel from Travnik and 
Gornji Vakuf, the central Bosnian towns where they had fought 
Bosnian Croats. 
  The sources said the army of Bosnian Croats overnight 
fiercely attacked the positions of Serb defenders in the 
northern Bosnian stretch of the Sava valley, especially those 
outside the Serb villages of Jenjic and Lepnica, but there were 
no casualties and the defenders had not responded.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 29 March reports 
intensified fighting in the following areas: 
  As the announcer in the studio reports, quoting 
correspondent 
Enes Musovic, "since 0515 this morning the aggressor's artillery 
has been firing a shell every second at the defense lines and 
the civilian quarters. The attacks are particularly 
concentrating in the region of Gradina on the right bank of the 
Drina River, from the direction of Foca and Cajnice." As 
correspondent from Gorazde Fahrudin Bekcic then reports, "eight 
injured and one killed is the final outcome of the chetnik 
rampage over the last 24 hours. The artillery attacks that had 
started yesterday stopped briefly just after midnight, to be 
continued with even greater ferocity at 0510 this morning. More 
than 2,000 shells of various calibers have landed in a matter of 
only a few hours. The aggressor is displaying the most intense 
attacks in the direction of Cajnice. They are attacking the 
entire defense line on the right bank of the Drina River between 
Osanica and Ustipraca with howitzers, tanks, mortars of all 
calibers, antiaircraft machine guns, self-propelled antiaircraft 
artillery, and hill guns. Another 10 trucks with fresh enemy 
forces arrived in this area at approximately 0500 hours. 
Perfectly reliable information claims that there are numerous 
Montenegrin reservists and mercenaries among them." As Bekcic 
continues to report, "the situation is equally dramatic on the 
other side, in the part of the battlefield toward Rogatica and 
in other directions." He concludes that "according to the 
reports from the field, this is the most powerful attack in this 
region" so far. 
  A report by Smajl Terzic from the information service of the 
7th South Operative Group of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army claims 
that "the aggressor has been attacking the defense lines in the 
zone of responsibility of the 7th South Operative Group from all 
available arms overnight. The situation was the most stormy 
near (Buzno Groblje) and (?Plane), where the united units in a 
counteroffensive pushed the chetniks back and conquered 
domineering elevations from which the enemy had been pounding 
the free territory day and night. Plenty of ammunition and arms 
were seized in this action. In retaliation for numerous losses 
in manpower and military hardware, the chetniks shelled the 
civilian targets in Mrkotic where one woman died. They are 
constantly attacking the Pejici-Bandera defense line, as well as 
(Krh and Svijakovac) from Dedovo Brdo."

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 28 March carries in its 
regular 35-minute newscast three reports on the combat situation 
in the republic. 
  Gorazde correspondent Enes Musovic reports that "an 
artillery 
attack at Mijanovici, from the direction of Miljane, is still in 
progress. The chetniks still do not believe that they cannot 
take another inch of the Gorazde free territory, although they 
are using the most destructive mortar shells, tanks, Pragas, and 
other deadly weapons. New groups of chetniks have reached 
Kozara, Ogorjevac, Duge, and Praca. The reconnaissance units of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army East Bosnian Operative Group have 
noticed that the chetniks are mining the railroad line in [name 
indistinct] on the Rogatica-Ilidza road. They have also noticed 
a large concentration of aggressor's forces in this area. In 
addition to attacking all the defense lines in the area of the 
Gorazde Municipality, the chetniks have managed to cut short the 
supply of humanitarian aid to Gorazde." 
  Correspondent Velid Djindo reports on the situation in Olovo 
and says that "this morning's gunfire announced another fierce 
day of war. The enemy guns were soon joined by mortars, which 
shelled military and civilian targets with the heaviest shells. 
Attacks at Olovo continued in the afternoon hours. We have no 
information about the consequences of the aggressor's attacks." 
  The studio announcer reads a report by the 1st Corps 
Information Service and says that "the aggressor today violated 
the cease-fire in the Sarajevo area. There were small arms' 
provocations from Nedzarici, from the direction of the Bosut 
barracks. The enemy snipers were particularly active, which 
resulted in the wounding of two members of our Army in Hladivode 
and Stupsko Brdo. The 1st Corps troops did not respond to these 
provocations."

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 29 (AFP) -- Fighting was reported in 
northern Bosnia Tuesday [29 March], as the UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees suspended a vital overland aid route into the 
region. In Geneva, UNHCR spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said all 
convoys to the northern enclave of Banja Luka via Serb-held 
territory would be suspended until further notice. Radio 
Sarajevo reported clashes between the Moslem-led Bosnian army 
and Bosnian Serb forces around the northern town of Maglaj. In 
Vitez, a UN Protection Force spokesman said Moslem and Croatian 
forces had pushed back Bosnian Serb forces by several kilometers 
(miles) to the west of Maglaj, echoing the radio report. 
Spokesman Rod Tracy, citing Moslem sources in Maglaj, said the 
Moslem and Croat forces had advanced to Mount Gavranic, 7 
kilometers (4 miles) to the west of the town. Tracy added that 
the British battalion based here had given Moslem forces at 
Zenica a 24-hour ultimatum to withdraw six anti-aircraft guns 
deployed in the region in violation of a ceasefire agreement. 
Echoing these reports, a Belgrade newspaper said Tuesday that 
eight civilians, including three children, were killed in Moslem 
shelling of the Bosnian Serb-held town of Doboj, also in 
northern Bosnia. The daily BORBA cited military officials as 
saying that the Moslem-led Bosnian army opened fire from 
positions at Matuzici to the southwest of the town, launching 
several dozen mortars onto the town. 
  Bosnian Serbs have reported an upsurge in fighting in the 
region around Doboj, as well as around Brcho, Kupres, over the 
last few days. Their leader Radovan Karadzic threatened on 
Sunday [27 March] to launch a counter-attack. In Geneva, Foa 
said the decision to suspend aid convoys to Banja Luka had been 
taken after an incident on Saturday at the UNHCR depot in the 
enclave, in which police seized 12 palettes of aid supplies from 
two UN trucks. She said only local officials had been at the 
time of the seizure. The police said the aid was to be 
distributed in Banja Luka, but they had not been authorized to 
take the aid, Foa said. Foa added that the suspension of convoys 
in the region would remain in force until the issue was 
resolved. "We have suspended convoys through the Banja Luka area 
until this is settled," she said. 
  The UNHCR warehouse in Banja Luka is used to store supplies 
not only for the town but also for other Moslem-held enclaves in 
central Bosnia. Radio Sarajevo also reported fighting Tuesday 
around the eastern enclave of Gorazde, with Serbs launching 
intense mortar attacks on the town. One person had been killed 
and eight injured, the radio said. It added that Serbian 
reinforcements had arrived in a dozen trucks on the other side 
of the Drina river. 
  Meanwhile Tracy added in Vitez that the head of British 
forces, Sir Charles Guthrie, was scheduled to arrive in the 
region Tuesday for a two-day visit taking in Vitez, Gornji Vakuf 
and Zepce. Separately here Tuesday, the resumption of a session 
of the Bosnian parliament was delayed for procedural reasons. 
Lawmakers are due to discuss the adoption of a constitution of a 
future Moslem-Croat federation.

  [Interview with Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan by 
Boris Gandel; place and date not given: "So That They Do Not 
Beat Us for What Is Not Our Fault"] 
  [Text] Following the recent appointment of the new 
government, the Slovak Republic already has its third foreign 
minister since its emergence. After Milan Knazko and Jozef 
Moravcik, the post of the head of Slovak diplomacy has been 
assumed by Eduard Kukan. He is a man with 30 years of 
diplomatic experience. He worked at several diplomatic missions 
abroad, most recently as Slovak ambassador to the United 
Nations. SMENA asked Kukan for an interview in connection with 
his appointment. 
  [Gandel] Minister, what are the priority issues for Slovak 
foreign policy? 
  [Kukan] The highest priority in Slovak foreign policy 
continues to be integration into Europe, the gradual 
incorporation and assimilation into European political, 
economic, and security structures. That is the main task on 
which we must concentrate. At this time, another priority is 
the reinforcement of good relations with neighboring countries. 
It is the duty of every state to maintain good relations with 
all countries and with its neighbors, in particular. We do not 
choose them; they are here. If neighbors are interested in 
living in a good relationship and peace, they should both be 
interested in maintaining the quality of relations. I see yet 
another priority in the need to help the economic development of 
Slovakia. A functioning economy is the main task of our new 
society, and, in this respect, our foreign service should help 
solve the economic questions. An orientation is also necessary 
toward the image of Slovakia that--I do not wish to go into 
details--is not always the best. The reasons for this situation 
are rather complex, and our foreign policy wants to be more 
active in the direction of making this image--I do not want to 
say favorable, but perhaps objective, so that they do not beat 
us for what is not our fault. This roughly sums up my 
priorities. 
  [Gandel] How do you intend to implement them? 
  [Kukan] Regarding integration into Europe, we cannot wait. 
It is a truly urgent issue. We signed the association 
agreement with the European Union and want it to be ratified by 
all of the Twelve before the end of the year. I say Twelve 
because, if we do not manage to get it done before the end of 
the year, there might be not 12 but 16 of them, and it would 
take that much longer. Hence, we are interested in seeing this 
agreement go into effect. In this context, I would like to 
bring up the issue of the stability pact in Europe. This is a 
very topical issue, and I am convinced that the development will 
show the need for Slovakia to pay great attention to this issue. 
  Regarding relations with neighbors, I would like to 
emphasize 
that Slovakia is interested in the development of good relations 
with Hungary. We want to create an atmosphere that would be 
propitious for a dialogue--that is, a discourse between the two 
partners. Both partners must be willing to conduct it. It must 
be emphasized that it should be relaxed, composed, and free of 
emotions so that we can discuss how to solve the problems. I am 
convinced that such an atmosphere will eventually lead to 
results. The same applies to the relations with the Czech 
Republic, Poland, Austria, and Ukraine. 
  As far as the economic profile of our foreign policy goes, 
the question of the efficiency of cooperation with the Slovak 
Economics Ministry will have to be solved. At our embassies 
abroad, we also have employees of the Economics Ministry whose 
work is not always sufficiently specified. We will endeavor 
finally to find a conceptual solution to these questions so that 
their activity is oriented toward specific tasks that would help 
the Slovak economy. 
  [Gandel] You spoke about our relations, and, in this 
context, I would like to ask something. Your Budapest 
counterpart, Geza Jeszenszky, said on Hungarian Radio on its 
Sunday [20 September] program that the statements made by new 
Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik are encouraging, and he 
expressed the opinion that a historic Slovak-Hungarian 
settlement could now take place. How do you understand his 
pronouncement? 
  [Kukan] That is such a vocal, eloquent expression--a 
Slovak-Hungarian settlement. In my perception, it is more on 
the pragmatic level. I have no idea what Mr. Jeszenszky meant 
by Slovak-Hungarian settlement, but apparently it was the return 
of Slovak-Hungarian relations to a constructive plane without 
the extreme politicizing of some issues. I see it rather more 
realistically. Our new government is interested in dealing with 
and solving specific problems in relations with our neighbors. 
I would prefer a path of gradual steps, from simple to more 
complex ones, because I believe that some problems could be 
solved quickly without any real difficulties. That could bring 
us to further, more substantial issues. I repeat, this requires 
willingness and an accommodating attitude from both partners. 
  [Gandel] Which country do you believe you should visit 
first and why? 
  [Kukan] You know, I inherited the foreign affairs sector, 
and certain trips and foreign political activities have already 
been arranged. It is in the interest of my credibility that I 
comply with these obligations of the Slovak Republic. The first 
trip should be to Poland on 8 April. It is a previously 
arranged affair. I should meet my Polish counterpart there. I 
am not certain, however, whether developments will bring 
something else before then. So, to your question why, I reply 
that it was discussed and agreed upon earlier. I believe we 
have really good preconditions for maintaining good cooperation 
with Poland. No doubt, goodwill is not lacking on either side. 
  [Gandel] During the government of Vladimir Meciar, criticism 
was heard that Slovakia is too East-oriented. Which direction 
would you like to emphasize? 
  [Kukan] I believe that this issue is blown up abroad in the 
West European and U.S. media. The orientation of Slovakia is 
quite clear. As I mentioned earlier, we are interested in 
integration into the European security, political, and economic 
structures. That speaks for itself. Of course, we are 
interested in developing our relations with Ukraine and other 
partners in the East. It is normal and natural. I believe that 
we can very well "score points" economically there. 
  When I said that these issues are sometimes blown out of 
proportion, I could give an example from my experience in New 
York, where our contacts with Russia and Ukraine were used as 
follows--ah, just look, Slovakia wants to return to the old 
times, etc. In this respect, the actual situation must be 
explained. In my opinion, any thinking person must understand 
that it is advantageous to have a neighbor in the East who 
offers good conditions for the export of our goods and 
represents a large market on which we can establish ourselves. 
No additional speculation is needed. It is completely 
unnecessary.... Our orientation is obvious--toward Europe, 
toward the European Union, and, at the same time, using the 
opportunities offered by cooperation with other countries as 
well. 
  [Gandel] Which of the problems of the Slovak Republic were 
most obvious to your partners in the United Nations? 
  [Kukan] They were the things that were also most discussed 
at home: the problems of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia, its 
status, what the Slovak Government is doing to solve this issue 
in accordance with international norms. These were the questions 
that most often popped up in conversation. There was also 
freedom of the press--that was observed very carefully. I will 
also give you an example, however, of how the U.S. media treated 
the case of Trnava University, particularly the beginning of the 
affair. The U.S. reader has never learned that the problem has 
been solved. Therefore, we have argued and contended that the 
U.S. media, which claim to be objective and fair, should always 
bring their work to the end. Our colleagues have also carefully 
followed the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros issue, in which they are well 
versed. These were the three main areas that were most 
discussed. 
  [Gandel] Among the most burning problems of Slovak diplomacy 
are certainly the vacant ambassadorial posts. Your predecessor, 
current Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik, once said that they would 
be filled by the end of March of this year. Several weeks ago, 
State Secretary Jan Lisuch spoke about the end of June. A 
consensus of three entities is needed for the approval of 
ambassadorial appointments--the Foreign Ministry, the 
government, and the president. In this context, when leaving 
the post of the head of diplomacy, Jozef Moravcik declared that 
it was a long way from the ministry to the presidency. Now the 
situation should be better in this respect. When do you believe 
it realistically possible for the ambassadorial posts to be 
finally filled? 
  [Kukan] Personally, I believe that the filling of the 
ambassadorial posts is a very important issue. The absence of 
ambassador to Washington for 14 months--that was not good, to 
say the least, and I am not going to go into details. Every 
country perceives its partner through the prism of whether there 
is an accredited ambassador in that country. On the basis of 
whether there is an ambassador, they judge the amount of 
interest in mutual cooperation. You mentioned some dates. I 
would prefer not to speak in a definite time frame. I know that 
my predecessor and the state secretary share with me the opinion 
that the ambassadorial posts must be filled. For practical 
reasons, however, a precise date cannot be set. You actually 
said that the authorization of appointments takes a while. I 
assume that it will be faster now and that it will be settled. 
Nevertheless, you know that we ask the country to which we are 
sending the ambassador for agreement. This sometimes takes 
three or four weeks, sometimes even longer. Therefore, I believe 
that it would not be proper to speak about specific dates. I 
can confirm, however, that I have spoken about it with Prime 
Minister Moravcik, who agrees that these questions must be 
solved immediately, regardless of the six-month term of office 
of the new government. We do not want to solve it at any cost. 
We want the ambassadors to be people who will represent 
Slovakia well. 
  [Gandel] In this context, I would ask: Would you let us know 
the name of your successor in New York? 
  [Kukan] I do not know. For the time being, my deputy, Peter 
Tomka, who has the rank of ambassador, has taken over the 
position. It is not a permanent solution because he is the 
Slovak Government's commissioner for the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros 
case at the International Court in The Hague. I left New York 
in a hurry, so I have not yet thought about who will get the 
post of ambassador to the United Nations. It is desirable, 
however, that he be there in September, when the General 
Assembly starts. 
  [Gandel] It is known that Eva Mitrova is to become Slovak 
ambassador to Budapest. To date, she has worked as ambassador 
to the Council of Europe. Do you believe it is appropriate for 
an ambassador to leave the post where he or she worked only 
briefly, just long enough to establish contacts, and transfer to 
a new place to start again practically from scratch, and may I 
also ask who is to replace Mrs. Mitrova in Strasbourg? 
  [Kukan] Of course, if the situation permits, it is in the 
best interest of the government for an ambassador who has 
established himself or herself somewhere, set up contacts, and 
begun to be productive for the government to stay there as long 
as possible. Life is not a straightforward affair, however, and 
it can happen that an ambassador who has good contacts at one 
location is needed elsewhere. I believe that this is so in the 
case of Mrs. Mitrova. Relations with Hungary are so important in 
our foreign policy that not having an ambassador there would be 
rather harmful to our objectives, particularly if we speak about 
the peaceful matter-of-fact dialogue we want to conduct with the 
Hungarian side. Hence, we really need an ambassador in Budapest. 
Regarding the successor to Mrs. Mitrova--we are a little 
further along there than we are in New York--we have some names, 
but it is not yet at such a stage that I can give them to you. 
  [Gandel] How would you assess--I would term it--the sincere 
message of greetings sent by U.S. President Bill Clinton to the 
new Government of the Slovak Republic? 
  [Kukan] I believe that the message is quite clear and 
favorable, and that it expresses full trust in the new 
government and a willingness to cooperate constructively and in 
a matter-of-fact way with this government. I have also received 
a letter of greeting from my U.S. counterpart, Warren 
Christopher, and I can say that it was not just a diplomatic 
message but a very personal one. Warren Christopher wrote that 
he knows what I have been doing and assures me of very effective 
cooperation. I must tell you that it felt good and that it 
encouraged me tremendously. I have received similar 
messages--from Klaus Kinkel, for instance--that were also not of 
the commonplace type that are sent in traditional diplomacy, 
those two or three phrases that one can say even if awakened at 
midnight. They were real messages, which took into account the 
Slovak situation and the specific person; they were messages 
actually addressed to me, Eduard Kukan. I must admit that it 
truly encouraged me very much.

on 21 March] 
  [Text] The political entities that have formed the new 
Slovak Government signed a coalition agreement on Monday [21 
March]. Jan Carnogursky (Christian Democratic Movement), Peter 
Weiss (Party of the Democratic Left), Milan Knazko (Alliance of

  (1) In the event of a situation arising that, in the opinion 
of any coalition partner, poses a threat to coalition

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement </F>
for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS, by Anna Samelova following the 
conclusion of the HZDS National Assembly in Presov on 27 
March--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Samelova] Mr. Chairman, you adopted a new 
political program for the movement. How does it differ from the 
previous one that was adopted in Trnava last year, entitled 
"From Sovereignty to Prosperity"? 
  [Meciar] The difference between the programs is, above all, 
in the chronology: This year's policy covers the period 1994 to 
1998. The program is built so that it allows for creating a 
basis for a government program, and, moreover, it reassesses the 
situation in which the Slovak Republic finds itself today. In 
other words, it is based on many years of experience, seeking 
pragmatic answers to the problems encountered in all spheres and 
in all kinds of activities, whether in politics, culture, or 
elsewhere, which the Slovak Republic must overcome. In other 
words, our program represents an offer. We are again the first 
to come up with something like this, and we expect again that 
the others will create alternatives to our program because we 
have, indeed, sought what is good and possible. 
  [Samelova] The assembly also altered the statutes of the 
movement, among other ways by putting the current consultative 
body, the HZDS Council, and the national leadership on an equal 
footing. What reasons have led you toward this step? Is this 
not some kind of duplicity? 
  [Meciar] No, in essence it means building a two-chamber 
system of the movement's leadership, which has been built like 
this from the very beginning but, owing to the passivity of the 
chairmen, has never been fulfilled. The movement's council will 
unite professional clubs, and it will unite the intellectual 
sphere that will work with us. It will also unite the deputies 
and the state administration that will work toward the elections 
and the local elections that are being prepared. This is of 
great significance. These people must have influence and space 
to make decisions. [passage omitted] At the same time, the 
principle that the leadership, after the Assembly, is the 
highest political body of the movement must be respected. 
  [Samelova] The Assembly devoted considerable attention to 
the 
analysis of why it was that the HZDS was in the opposition again 
today. Could you tell us something about the results of this 
discussion? 
  [Meciar] It was a businesslike discussion. We are not 
looking for a culprit; we are looking for causes, but, above 
all, we are seeking guarantees in the movement's mechanisms for 
the future period. We cannot fail to see that 18 deputies from 
our movement failed from both the human and the political 
viewpoints. Of them, 10 signed a statement saying that, if they 
were to leave the movement, they would give up their mandates. 
They have left the movement but have kept the mandates. We 
cannot fail to see that the government was overthrown not only 
by the opposition, but also by the attitude of these people who 
were in the movement with us and recognized its program. We are 
seeking ways to guarantee the stability of the parliament both 
within the movement and outside it. We are seeking to undertake 
measures inside the movement in the sphere of pledges, 
discipline, and responsibility toward citizens, and ways to win 
over the citizens during the elections so that they may find the 
same security with us that they did in 1992. 
  [Samelova] You mentioned the deputies who left the HZDS. In 
this connection, self-critical addresses were allegedly heard at 
the assembly. They came from the districts from which these 
deputies, who are no longer members of the movement, got to 
parliament. What was this self-criticism about? 
  [Meciar] The selection of the candidates was based on 
proposals of district assemblies, the so-called nominating 
assemblies. Then it was confirmed by the nominating assembly 
held in Zilina. Afterwards, they went through psychological 
tests and personal interviews. Despite this, there were human 
errors. In other words, the criticism was aimed at the 
districts for not knowing their candidates well. In many cases, 
those who had left could not cope with their work because they 
had no dialogue with the movement they had left or with the 
citizens. [passage omitted] 
  The government is now in the hands of these 18 people. For 
me, it is always a warning if people put their subjective desire 
for posts or power above the principles they are to serve. 
  [Samelova] Mr. Chairman, on Thursday [24 March], at the HZDS 
meeting, the moderator said that the radio and television were 
closed to the HZDS. Ever since your Cabinet was dismissed, the 
HZDS has not organized any news conferences. You yourself have 
refused in the parliament requests by radio and television for 
interviews. How would you explain this contradiction? 
  [Meciar] To be precise, running along the corridor with 
somebody sticking a microphone in front of you--that is not an 
offer. It is normal that giving interviews is also work. It is 
work for both the editor and the interviewee, and time and 
conditions must be allocated for it. I see no contradiction 
here. Indeed, we appear less on both the screens and everywhere 
else. We can see the changing character of reporting, we can 
see the contents of the reports, and we are aware that we are 
not participating in it. Our assessment of these things is that 
this is one of the areas where we were unable to ensure full 
democracy. That is why, logically, when conditions prompt a 
different interpretation of democracy, the media behave 
differently, too. 
  [Samelova] Two weeks ago, at support meetings for your 
departing government, some of your followers physically attacked 
four journalists. How do you view this unpleasant incident, the 
fact that those involved were your potential voters? 
  [Meciar] Did you see it? 
  [Samelova] I was there. 
  [Meciar] I received the resolution from the people who were 
there and who were protesting. They talked about Mr. Zitny, who 
sprayed tear gas in people's eyes without their doing anything 
bad. There were about 100 signatures of eyewitnesses who 
described the situation in a completely different way. I am not 
a judge to play the role of a referee. If I am to follow 
whomever I trust more, I certainly trust the citizens more than 
Messrs. Zitny and Hrib. 
  [Samelova] Mr. Chairman, my last question will be worded so 
as to be both personal and professional. When, in June 1992, 
you took the post of the prime minister for the second time, you 
said in your main interviews that you had given a written pledge 
to your party that, if the Slovak parliament should recall you 
again from the post of prime minister, you would not return to 
politics. Everything seems to indicate that you are preparing 
for the election campaign and that you are preparing for your 
third return to politics. How did you (?personally) come to 
terms with this pledge? 
  [Meciar] First, I have not left politics yet. I have only 
changed position from the government to the opposition. My 
daughter came to see me in parliament when they recalled me. 
When they dismissed me, she came to see me and said something 
that was absolutely correct from the point of view of her 
understanding the events that concern me. She told me that 
politics was one hell of a dirty business and that I should 
leave. 
  But there are other points. First, the movement to which I 
offered my post invited me back to it. Second, there is a 
certain hope and trust of the citizens that things may look 
different, that there is an alternative to the current 
government coalition. If all of this has some meaning, I will 
come again in September with an offer. I will ask those who 
will decide in the elections what I should do.

  [Text] [Announcer] The Coalition Council chaired by Prime 
Minister Jozef Moravcik met in Bratislava this afternoon. The 
meeting took place at the level of chairmen and deputy chairmen 
of the coalition parties and movements. Representatives of the 
Hungarian Coalition took part in it as well. At a short, 
improvised news conference held this evening, we learned the 
following about the Coalition Council meeting: 
  [Moravcik] "We have discussed only one theme so far, and 
that 
is the preparation of the government policy statement. It is 
indeed a very serious matter, with the economic program in its 
focus. 
  "As you know, the talks on a standby loan were suspended 
because the previous government was unable to accept the 
conditions that were set additionally. So far, economic 
development has been different from what was envisaged when the 
budget was drafted. It means that our starting points now are 
worse than the starting points of the previous government, which 
has caused a whole range of problems we have to resolve this 
week. Which means that we have to concentrate on solving them 
this week. 
  "Today, we had to make an important political decision as to 
whether we should apply for a standby loan [from the IMF] and 
whether we would use the time allowed us to establish certain 
development trends. Our decision was positive in both cases, 
which means, yes, we will apply for a standby loan, and we will 
want to establish certain development trends. Naturally, this 
will require some unpopular measures. We are considering what 
specific measures to take since there are a number of 
possibilities." 
  [Announcer] Asked whether the government had decided to 
implement major restrictive measures in the social sector at the 
cost of their endangering the preelection position of the 
coalition partners, the prime minister said: 
  [Moravcik] "We will have to adopt all measures once we have 
considered the acceptability of their impact on the social 
sphere. This will require enormous effort on our part in order 
to find a certain balance. We will have to do this by 12 April, 
when we are to address the parliament [with the government 
policy statement], or even earlier because we are to submit the 
policy statement to the deputies on 6 April." 
  [Announcer] With regard to the state budget, Jozef Moravcik 
said: 
  [Moravcik] "If we want to get a standby loan, we have to 
respect the 4-percent limit. That is the key issue. We want to 
gain a better position in international currency relations. The 
standby loan does not only mean that we will get a credit of 
tens of millions of dollars. It also means an assessment of our 
financial credibility, which we need if we are to communicate 
with the financial world." 
  [Announcer] The congresses of the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia and of the National Democratic Party were held on 
Saturday [26 March]. Asked whether the government's 
deliberations today take account of the results achieved by the 
supreme bodies of these two parties, Jozef Moravcik said: 
  [Moravcik] "We focused on what I have just told you."

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus by Stanislav </F>
Drahny and Robert Casensky; place and date not given: "The Old 
Bloc Must Be Abolished No Later Than 1 May"] 
  [Text] Rudolf Filkus, the former HZDS economics expert, 
has become Slovak finance minister and deputy prime minister 
responsible for economic development. He granted our paper an 
interview on the economic objectives of Moravcik's new Cabinet 
and the prospects of economic relations between Slovakia and the 
Czech Republic. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] In what way will you improve the difficult 
economic situation in Slovakia? 
  [Filkus] Every government has some limits. Our limits are 
determined by the time remaining until the early elections. We 
have to adopt this viewpoint when speaking about what the 
government can do and what it believes to be its main task. In 
my opinion, the government's main task is the political and 
economic stabilization of this country. We have to send signals 
abroad describing the extent to which the situation has 
stabilized. This is important in terms of the influx of foreign 
capital into the country. Of course, it is also important in 
terms of the domestic economy. There are no miraculous cures 
that would help us to do something great, if for no other reason 
than that our time span is limited. We have to take this factor 
into consideration. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] Are you considering a devaluation of the 
Slovak koruna, a devaluation that would strengthen the 
export-stimulating policy, or are you going to orient yourselves 
toward protective measures, such as import certificates, for 
instance? 
  [Filkus] First, I have to say that the finance minister 
should not have a say in devaluation. We are giving an 
opportunity here to those who are in charge of monetary 
policy--that is, the Central Bank. This bank is responsible for 
monetary stability and is entitled to decide, while taking 
economic criteria into account, whether to devalue or not. Of 
course, the bank governor can come to see the minister and ask 
him what he should do to improve the situation in the state 
budget, to decrease the pressure of the inflationary spiral, 
etc. I want to say that our people strongly believe, 
unfortunately, that the finance minister should decide whether 
to devalue. I repeat, this is a matter to be decided 
exclusively by the National Bank. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] Devaluation can be replaced by an import 
surcharge. However, this is an inefficient measure. Are you 
going to maintain it? 
  [Filkus] The protection of the market is a normal economic 
tool. I consider the surcharge that we have introduced to be a 
good economic measure because it can, at least theoretically, 
protect the market. At the same time, however, it is necessary 
to implement subsequent systemic measures not only to protect 
the domestic market, but also to help develop a proexport 
policy. I expected, for example, that import surcharge, 
particularly on food products from the Czech Republic, would 
help us to "clean" the market. The empty space thus created 
would be filled by our producers, which is usual in normally 
functioning economies. Unfortunately, this is not what is 
happening. On the contrary, prices went up following the 
introduction of the import surcharge. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] What will happen to the "quality control" 
of Czech food then? 
  [Filkus] On Monday [21 March], we discussed with Minister 
Kocarnik three open issues. They are food certificates, the 
customs union, and two clearing blocs [clearingovy blok]. As 
regards the certificates, you certainly know that an agreement, 
which is valid until the end of March, provides for mutual 
recognition of the Czech and Slovak certificates. This should 
change as of 1 April. I consider it to be a positive step by 
the Slovak side that we spoke openly about those problems. The 
validity of the certificates will not be abolished on 31 March 
but will be extended for at least one month. In this way, we 
will avoid the situation that recently arose on the Czech-Slovak 
borders. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] People are saying that similar duty should 
be imposed on consumer goods. Can you confirm this? 
  [Filkus] This is a matter to be decided in the future. Why 
should the quality of some products not be tested? I am of the 
opinion that this problem is different from the problems in 
trading relations with other countries. For many products, we 
have the same technology as the Czech Republic, the same 
standards, and the same quality. I do not see a large problem 
here. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] The so-called clearing account plays an 
important role in Czech-Slovak relations. Slovakia has a large 
deficit on this account. Are you going to try to eliminate the 
old clearing bloc? 
  [Filkus] This is very serious business. The old bloc has 
become a subject of various speculations, and many entrepreneurs 
have made money to the detriment of the state. I do not believe 
that this is an honest business. By antedating their claims, 
entrepreneurs made a profit based on the fact that they were 
sending money through the old bloc and receiving it from the new 
one. At present, this problem has accumulated, and debt has 
exceeded the limit of 130 million European Currency Units. The 
state had to pay it using not the old exchange rate but the 
current one. The state had to suffer a loss that is 
proportionate to the profit the speculators made on the clearing 
account. Because of this, the old bloc should be abolished as 
soon as possible--no later than 1 May. 
  Of course, it will depend on both sides whether this bloc 
will be abolished. According to preliminary consultations, both 
sides are in favor of abolishing the old clearing bloc as soon 
as possible. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] You said that several cases of fraud have 
been mentioned in connection with the old bloc. Do you believe 
they could be explained retrospectively? 
  [Filkus] I do not believe that is possible. 
  [DENNI TELEGRAF] Will there be a second wave of coupon 
privatization in Slovakia? 
  [Filkus] Certainly. The fact that the privatization 
process, which is an important economic accomplishment, has 
become a tool for concentrating power makes us accelerate the 
privatization process, depoliticize it, and make it more 
understandable. In the fall, we want to prepare the second wave 
of coupon privatization. 
  I believe that all of the privatization methods are equal. 
Coupon privatization is the fastest. We have promised our 
people: We are going to give you back a part of the property 
you lost in wages. Privatization has an ethical aspect, too.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  "Dangerous" Precedent </H6>
  A commentary in a Bratislava independent weekly has warned 
that the proposed extension of a new law providing for 
restitution of property unjustly seized during the communist era 
to cover the decade preceding the communist takeover (including 
the 1939-45 period, when Slovakia was a satellite of the Third 
Reich) may create a "dangerous" precedent, legitimating the 
claims of former Sudeten Germans to former Czechoslovak 
property. The author, Jaroslav Stracelsky, writing in the 22 
February issue of MOSTY, urged Slovak lawmakers to pay close 
attention to the drafting of the restitution law and, in 
particular, to oppose the government in its effort to shift the 
beginning of the period covered by the law from the originally 
proposed February 1948 to November 1938. 
<H5>  Role of Hungarian Leader </H5>
  Stracelsky claims that, while drafting the restitution law, 
designed to compensate Slovak citizens and organizations, 
particularly Jewish citizens and the churches, for losses 
suffered because of political discrimination in the pre-1989 
period, the Slovak Government may have been unduly influenced by 
the demands of Miklos Duray, the chairman of Egyutteles, the 
largest political party representing the Hungarian minority in 
Slovakia. Speaking on Slovak television, Duray attacked the 
so-called Benes Decrees of 1945, which legalized the expulsion 
of the Sudeten Germans as well as some Hungarians from 
Czechoslovakia immediately after World War II. Duray insisted 
that these decrees be invalidated. 
<H5>  Implications for Sudeten Claims </H5>
  Stracelsky suggested that "Slovakia's Hungarian citizens 
apparently felt that what Duray had in mind was redress of old 
wrongdoings" and that the Slovak Government must have shared 
that view. This, he said, may explain why, "under the innocent 
pretext" of wanting to rectify the injustices inflicted on the 
churches and their property, the government proposed to push 
back the date for property restitution to the Jewish communities 
from 1948 to the day of the Vienna Arbitration of 2 November 
1938, when Slovakia ceded portions of its territory to Hungary. 
But, argues Stracelsky, "this innocuous legal move" has serious 
hidden implications. The government has either ignored or 
overlooked the fact that, "while on the day of the Vienna 
Arbitration the Slovak south was not yet occupied by Hungary, 
Hitler had already annexed the Sudeten territory." Thus, whether 
intended or not, the recognition of this fact by the Slovak 
Government, as reflected in the draft of the law, "will make it 
possible for the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft [the 
Bavaria-based organization of Sudeten Germans and their 
descendants] to obtain additional support for its territorial 
and property claims" against the Czech Republic. 
  The Sudeten Germans will be able to insist that, because the 
Slovak Government seems now to be willing to compensate those 
who were dispossessed as early as 1938, the Czech Government 
should follow suit. "The fact that this can be done in Slovakia 
should make things easier for the [Sudeten] Germans in their 
negotiations with the Czech Republic as well." It should be 
clear, Stracelsky adds, that "the Slovak Government would be 
committing a major mistake," and he admonishes the Slovak 
parliamentary deputies to be "vigilant" no matter how "innocent 
the government documents submitted to them may appear." 
<H5>  Link to German Visitor Seen </H5>
  In conclusion, Stracelsky hints that Duray's criticism of 
the 
Benes Decrees may have been related to a visit to Budapest by 
Klaus Franke, a Christian Democratic deputy in the German 
Bundestag. Franke's trip, he points out, took place shortly 
before Duray's television appeal. During that trip, according to 
Stracelsky, Franke allegedly tried to induce Gyorgy Csoty, the 
deputy chairman of the Hungarian parliament's Foreign Affairs 
Committee, "to make sure that the Hungarian minority deputies in 
Slovakia appeal, in the Slovak National Council and the Slovak 
media, for the cancellation of the Benes Decrees, which affected 
the Sudeten Germans." Stracelsky characterizes the Franke-Csoty 
talks as a "provocative event" that could not but "attract 
attention in both Hungary and Slovakia" and speculates about the 
possible existence of "a lobby (endowed with considerable 
financial means) that may be interested in a deliberate 
escalation of Slovak-Hungarian and Slovak-Czech tensions and 
that utilizes, for that specific purpose, its own stable of 
Trojan horses." The potential impact of such tensions on the 
course of the early elections that are being planned, he adds, 
should not be ignored.

  [Text] The head of the club of deputies of the Liberal 
Democracy Party [LDS], Jozef Skoljc, says that the proposal to 
impeach minister Jansa was not a proposal to alter the political 
balance of powers: 
  [Begin Skoljc recording] In a way, at least in my opinion, 
it is very problematic if the cooperation in the coalition is 
made conditional on a certain minister being untouchable. This 
is a new position in these talks and neither the Christian 
Democrats nor the Social Democrats have ever championed this 
position so far. 
  It is also rather nonpolitical to say that the Social 
Democrats equal Janez Jansa. The Social Democrats were given an 
opportunity to take part in the government. Now, whether they 
will decide for cooperation or not is another matter. However, 
the fact is that whenever somebody has been replaced so far, 
parties did not leave the government coalition because of it. 
Woe to those parties that are prisoners of the ambitions of 
their presidents! [end recording]

Social Democrats, gave the following statement: 
  [Begin Pucnik recording] I shall say it directly -- the 
Social Democrats no longer have any business in this coalition. 
The manner in which the prime minister got rid of our 
president, the defense minister [Janez Jansa], is such that even 
discussion is no longer possible. What next? Regarding certain 
issues, we have been in opposition so far. Now we will, of 
course, pursue these things even more consistently. The 
opposition parties do not have much scope and the same applies 
to us. We will shift the focus of our activity outside the 
parliament, in strengthening the organization, attracting new 
members, and forming new local organizations, and thus, 
preparing ourselves for the local elections that will take place 
at the end of this year. [end recording]

coalition: 
  [Begin Peterle recording] In keeping with the obligation by

or leaving the government. The latter possibility is definitely 
stronger. As you will recall, we demanded that Jansa and the

supporters of compromised Slovene Defense Minister Janez Jansa 
continued their rally in support of Jansa in front of the 
parliament building in Ljubljana this evening. Surrounded by a 
police cordon, angry demonstrators are demanding the removal of 
President Milan Kucan and Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek. Jansa's 
supporters this evening started to collect signatures for a 
petition demanding that the parliament not dismiss Jansa. 
Serious threats were voiced at the expense of those who see 
Slovenia's future without Jansa and disagree with his political 
guidelines. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ljubljana, March 28 (TANJUG) -- Some 10,000 
demonstrators rallied outside the Slovenia's parliament building 
to express support to the Defense Minister Janez Jansa. Police 
were trying to prevent the demonstrators, from the rightist and 
nationalist parties, from forcing their way into the building 
and interrupting the discussion on the proposal of Prime 
Minister Janez Drnovsek to relieve Jansa because of abuses of 
power and violations of the constitution and of human rights. 
Jansa's followers were demanding also the state's President 
Milan Kucan and Prime Minister Drnovsek be relieved. 
  The immediate cause for removing Jansa from his ministerial 
post was his involvement in the recent brutal assault of 
military police on civilian Milan Smolnikar near Ljubljana. The 
military police at Jansa's orders beat up Smolnikar, accusing 
him of spying on the Defense Ministry for Slovenian President 
Milan Kucan. The removal of Jansa was Monday opposed by Foreign 
Minister Lojze Peterle, president of the Christian Democrat 
Party, the third strongest party in the ruling coalition, who 
proposed to the prime minister to withdraw the demand. After 
Drnovsek refused to compromise, even if the Christian Democrats 
left the ruling coalition, Peterle requested a parliamentary 
debate on confidence the government. 
  In the biggest crisis in Slovenia since it seceded from the 
former Yugoslavia, the Army and police were also at odds as a 
reflection of, as set out in Ljubljana, the intransigent 
interests of the political currents in the state leadership. 
Police was prepared for possible resistance from some sections 
of the Slovene Army which opposed Jansa's removal. 
  The Slovenian parliament was expected Monday night to come 
forth with a stand on the prime minister's proposal for Jelko 
Kacin, former information minister, to become defense minister.

<F P=106> [Ivan Puc editorial commentary: "Prime Minister Without a </F>
Magic Formula"] 
  [Text] After several days of hesitation, Drnovsek decided 
to make a move he was compelled to by the United List and many 
of his deputies despite the possibility of tensions that might 
lead to bipolarization. The replacement of Janez Jansa with 
Jelko Kacin, former Democratic information minister and, before 
that, Jansa's deputy in what was then the Secretariat for 
Peoples' Defense, thus marked the political spring that could 
quickly turn into a political winter. We can merely guess what 
tilted the scales against the defense minister. However, it 
seems that, this time, the prime minister did not find a magic 
formula with which he could at least partially satisfy the main 
protagonist of this -- as we have subsequently learned -- 
criminal game. Besides Jansa, it also involved Christian 
Democratic [SKD] Interior Minister Ivan Bizjak, and primarily 
President Milan Kucan, the likely mastermind of the entire game, 
who was also instrumental in the downing of Peterle. Let us 
just recall Kucan's carefully chosen, ominous words about 
disqualifications and liquidations after the organization that 
is supposedly backed by Kucan's circle realized that the Defense 
Ministry had established the presence of its agents, even though 
it did not identify them yet. 
  We would be naive to think that Drnovsek decided for the 
replacement (only) because of the overstepping of their 
authority by the defense ministry employees and the violation of 
constitutionally guaranteed human rights. These were precisely 
the arguments that a part of the former committee for the 
protection of human rights put to him. The foundation stone for 
the replacement was laid when the Democrats abandoned their 
several-months-old pro-Demos policy and, together with some 
political organizations, finally cut back on the defense funds. 
By joining the Liberal Democratic Party, they covered their 
backs in the face of an increasingly unfavorable outcome of the 
[Maribor] arms' affair, whose main protagonists they were. The 
interior minister of that time, Igor Bavcar, and the director of 
VIS [Security-Information Service] Dr. Miha Brejc (as the latest 
testimonies and the Maribor public prosecutor's indictment 
suggest) with the cooperation of the president of the state 
arbitrarily and independently of the Defense Council and the 
Defense Ministry, which is authorized to issue permits for the 
transit of arms, brought arms for Hasan Cengic to Maribor 
airport. And how did the Christian Democrats, who will now be 
the only "right-wing" party in the government, decide? It is 
not very likely that the Social Democrats will stay in the 
government -- despite Drnovsek's offer -- and accept another 
ministerial post. This was implied by Jansa's clear warning to 
Drnovsek immediately after the prime minister's decision was 
announced to the public. The stance of the Christian Democrats 
was not decisive enough. Their public statement demonstrated 
that -- despite the demands for an investigation with clear 
results -- they allowed Drnovsek to have a free hand. They only 
added a warning that -- if the investigation shows so -- the 
president of the state should also resign. However, how the 
investigation will continue without Jansa is quite another 
matter.

  [Excerpt] Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes is visiting 
Slovenia. He has already met with the highest state officials, 
namely, President Kucan, Prime Minister Drnovsek, and Foreign 
Minister Peterle. After the talks Willy Claes and Lojze Peterle 
signed a bilateral agreement on road and air traffic between 
Belgium and Slovenia. The ministers assessed today's talks at 
the news conference from which we have a report by Igor Juric: 
  [Begin recording] [Juric] Willy Claes assessed the talks as 
successful, which is not surprising because there are no 
problems between the countries. He emphasized the importance of 
the signing of today's agreement and spoke in favor of imminent 
agreement on double taxation and protection of investments, and 
an agreement on cultural and scientific cooperation, which would 
strengthen the contacts between the countries. He spoke most, 
however, about the relations between Slovenia and the European 
Union: 
  [Claes, in English with superimposed translation into 
Slovene] I believe that the time has come for final 
negotiations on associate membership between Slovenia and the 
European Union. At the end of the week I will meet with Jacques 
Delors and urge him that the negotiating team that has already 
visited Slovenia faces the council as soon as possible and 
proposes its views on negotiations. 
  The final admittance will, of course, depend on the European 
Parliament and the parliaments of individual member-states of 
the Union. I believe that Slovenia meets all the criteria and 
our state will support you wholeheartedly in this. 
  [Juric] In the continuation he also said he doubted that the 
next expansion of the European Union would occur before 1996 as 
the present members must first resolve their internal problems. 
He concurred with our foreign minister that a gradual approach 
is needed in the integration with the European Union. 
  Minister Peterle said that Slovenia has made the biggest 
steps toward the European Union so far while Belgium was the 
chairman of the Union. The result of good relations between the 
countries is also the signing of today's agreement, which is the 
first between the countries, and will definitely help more 
intense economic cooperation. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Alain Lamassoure, minister for European Affairs 
in the French Government, is visiting Slovenia. He was received 
by Prime Minister Drnovsek and Foreign Minister Peterle, while 
the esteemed guest also held talks with the members of the 
Parliamentary Commission for International Relations. Tomaz 
Gerden reports from a news conference by Lamassoure and Peterle: 
  [Begin recording] [Gerden] Alain Lamassoure, minister for 
European Affairs in the French Government, is in Slovenia for 
the third time. The previous two meetings took place at the 
party level, when Mr. Lamassoure supported Slovene efforts to 
gain independence in 1991. With Foreign Minister Peterle and 
Prime Minister Drnovsek they discussed French-Slovene relations, 
which are excellent according to Minister Lamassoure. [passage 
omitted] 
  The French, that is to say, the Renault automobile factory 
will continue to invest in Novo Mesto Revoz factory and broaden 
its economic cooperation with our country. Both delegations 
discussed the role of Slovenia in the European Union in great 
detail. Minister Lamassoure assured that France views Slovenia 
as a Central European country that is no longer a part of the 
Balkan events. [passage omitted] 
  Minister Lamassoure said that France will support Slovenia 
in 
negotiations on the association agreement. This agreement could 
be signed as soon as during the French chairmanship of the 
European Union after the new year. Regarding the lifting of the 
arms embargo for Slovenia, France continues to be cautious, 
however, in the foreseeable future it will support Slovene 
demands in the UN Security Council. 
  Slovene Foreign Minister said the following about the talks 
with Minister Lamoassoure: 
  [Peterle] I am glad that there are no particular open issues 
on a bilateral level and that relations are developing well. I 
am, of course, particularly pleased that the emphasis is being 
placed on economic development. [passage omitted] 
  The bulk of our discussion concentrated on multilateral 
affairs, especially the issue of our drawing closer to the 
European Union, and within this context we also discussed our 
rapprochement with, that is to say, the formalization of our 
relations with the WEU. We also discussed the Partnership for 
Peace and to so-called Balladur Plan, or the stability plan, in 
which Slovenia is interested along with some other countries.

told Czech radio about the meeting: 
  [Begin Klaus recording] Today's meeting discussed the 
outcome 
of the talks of the Coalition Four held yesterday and confirmed, 
more or less, our basic positions. As far as election laws are 
concerned, we have still not managed to reach a compromise, or 
what could be termed its essence. We repeat that our current 
positions on this issue are still valid. These positions have 
been voiced on many occasions, and, as far as this case is 
concerned, they happen to be identical with those contained in 
the government's proposal, which is already in parliament. 
  To pursue any further talks in this respect, our party's 
political committee has authorized the chairman to negotiate 
possible compromises with the coalition partners. That is one 
thing. 
  As for the other topics, a consultation on the next course 
of 
action to be taken with regard to Jewish property is to take 
place later today. Several of our ministers will attend. I 
think these are the main matters we are currently interested in.

<F P=106> [Article by "jab": "Who Is Who and Who Was What?; Political </F>
Officers of the Previous Regime Are Being Heaved Into Top Army 
Positions"] 
  [Excerpts] General Vacek, former minister of defense, has 
remained loyal to the army even as a pensioner. To this day, he 
is moving without any restrictions in the highest military 
circles, and his former subordinates receive him loyally and 
cordially, with all honors. Whenever he visits an Army unit, he 
is met by the commander's adjutant and must sign the visitors' 
book, as though he were an officer in uniform. (This official 
duty and regulation does not apply to the civilian Vacek.) 
  Of course, the minister of defense cannot be everywhere. He 
should, however, make sure that key posts are held by people who 
recognize the basic military virtue--discipline--and who 
understand their service as one to their country and not to the 
former minister. Will it be the prime minister again who will 
himself have to set right all the potential Milovice and Ralsko 
affairs [sites of former Soviet military bases, the 
privatization of which had been sought by high-ranking officers 
of the former communist-controlled Czechoslovak Army]? 
  Although 82 financial desks (offices) have been established 
in the armed forces at a cost of some 200 million korunas, the 
financial officers of individual units have self-evidently 
retained their previous positions. The situation is reminiscent 
of that of the Culture Ministry's Theater Department, which, 
although it in practice no longer takes care of any theaters, 
employs the same (and, according to some reports, an even 
greater) number of people as it did in November 1989. 
<H5>  "We Do Not Have Other Experts" </H5>
  Minister Baudys (we would like to take his side, were it not 
that so many results of the Army's transformation testify 
against him) keeps saying that "we do not have any other 
experts." Leaving aside the experts who have built for Baudys a 
laser firing range directly in his office, the chief occupation 
of the "Ministry of Defense and General Staff experts" is how to 
create jobs for their fellow warriors from the era of struggle 
against the imperialist threat, who would otherwise face 
redundancy. Whereas in the Armies of the United States, Great 
Britain, and even Sweden staff numbers in logistics are being 
cut as a result of computerization, in our country they are 
growing. Is the minister too busy? 
  And what about the much-touted operation against the number 
of drones who worked as political officers and against the 
maladies of our military past in general? 
<H5>  What Kind of Experts Do We Have? </H5>
  Colonel Josef Bagin, former chief of Military 
Counterintelligence, today works at the head office of the 
Military Police. 
  Colonel Frantisek Dvorak, former chief of the Military 
Counterintelligence Inspection Office in Prague, is today chief 
of the Ministry of Defense Inspection Authority, which is also 
in charge of Military Defense Intelligence. He has built his 
military career on his friendship with Gen. Vacek, which 
constitutes, at the very least, the potential risk of 
information leaks. 
  Colonel Josef Dvorak, former chief of Military 
Counterintelligence in Tabor, can be found serving in Mlada 
Boleslav today. 
  General Klima, a participant in the Second Nationwide 
Congress of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (so much 
for nonparty members), is commander of the 2d Combined Aviation 
Corps in Hradec Kralove. 
  Colonel Burda (today commander of the Combined Transport 
Regiment in Pardubice) acquired fame when he declared, as late 
as 1990, that "the lessons from the crisis-ridden development [a 
hardline communist document on lessons to be learned from the 
"Prague Spring" of 1968] are and will always remain valid" for 
him. 
  Colonel Pavel Vesely, former chairman of the Communist Party 
of Czechoslovakia Committee at the Brno Military Academy, who is 
a friend of [chief of General Staff] General Nekvasil, is today 
commander of the Prerov air base. Lieutenant Colonel Reznak, 
formerly political officer of military unit 1,562, has found a 
safe haven in military unit 1,999 in Pardubice. 
<H5>  Experts With a Title Before and After the Name </H5>
  Colonel Docent Engineer Frantisek Korinek, candidate of 
sciences, involved as a functionary in "Operation Wave" [planned 
by the communist regime to crack down on its critics], serves 
with a high rank at the Higher Military School of Ground Forces 
in Vyskov, where he is educating future experts. 
  Colonel Docent Engineer Frantisek Blaha, another functionary 
involved in "Operation Wave," heads the Department for 
Pedagogical Science at the Brno Military Academy. From other 
officers involved in "Operation Wave," we will also find there 
Lieutenant Docent F. Vizdal, Ph.D. and candidate of sciences. 
  Colonel Docent Zdenek Rozum, Ph.D., candidate of sciences, 
formerly a staffer at the Evening University of 
Marxism-Leninism, is now deputy departmental head at the Brno 
Military Academy. [passage omitted] 
  On the other hand, officers who refused to sign a 
resolution in support of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia 
in November 1989, who were never members of the Communist Party 
of Czechoslovakia, who did not abet former political officers, 
and who have helped shed light on the Army's involvement in 
Operations "Wave" and "Intervention" [another operation against 
critics of the regime planned during the latter stages of the 
communist regime], are being harassed and liquidated "in the 
spirit" of the minister's Order 023 about interviews and ways of 
dealing with personnel issues. For example, Captain Kjucukov, 
from the Third Communications Battalion in Breclav, who helped a 
Ministry of Defense commission of inquiry decode General Petr's 
coded message number 4A, became victim to permanent harassment 
in service and, under psychological pressure from the commander 
of the engineering battalion, left for civilian life on 31 
January 1994. 
<H5>  What Did Gen. Nekvasil Have To Say? </H5>
  All the names cited above are from a letter that a group of 
officers from Olomouc addressed to the Defense and Security 
Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies this January. 
  How did Gen. Nekvasil, chief of the General Staff of the 
Czech Army, react? 
  On 1 March 1994 (speaking apparently on behalf of all 
officers who, like himself, underwent their military training 
and education toward subservience in the USSR), he declared: It 
is necessary to put an end to the inflammatory voices from 
Olomouc, which disrupt the working climate and lecture the 
General Staff on what to do in the Army. 
  What can one add to this? A group of officers from Olomouc 
had turned to their constitutional officials, which is, and 
should be, their right, guaranteed by the Constitution. 
<H5>  No One Takes Any Interest in the Contents of the Complaint </H5>
  The solution resembles those that the Ministry of the 
Interior used to apply [in the 1950's], when some prisoner 
managed to smuggle out from a forced labor camp a letter with a 
complaint. The investigation, and, of course, the subsequent 
punishment concerned as a matter of principle the "illegal 
sending," while the contents of the complaint went unheeded. 
  The senders of the Olomouc letter are in for similar 
treatment today. The gray pigeons raised their eyebrows and 
told themselves that the buoyant heads who had written to the 
Defense and Security Affairs Committee must be cut down to size 
[sentence as published, apparently a literary allusion]. 
  We do not have anything against members of the Defense and 
Security Affairs Committee, and we believe that its members are 
decent, educated people. Nonetheless, similar practices disrupt 
the trust of the citizens (and not only those who are 
conscripted) in their freely elected representatives. If a 
citizen is made to feel again and again that there is no right 
and no justice, the result is a devastating percentage of people 
who have no confidence in parliament. Naturally, this also 
means no confidence in the parliamentary system as such. Free 
criticism and control represent the foundations of democracy, as 
those who read [philosopher and first Czechoslovak President] 
T.G. Masaryk know. In U.S. Army barracks, you will find posters 
with the text: Blow the Whistle! [last three words published in 
English] What it means is: Blow the whistle and let it be 
known when you witness something in your service that you 
genuinely dislike. The text is usually followed by a list of 
all the things that give you the right to blow the whistle. 
  If some blowing of the whistle (for example, a letter to a 
congressman) were to be followed by harassment, those guilty of 
it would get into very serious trouble. 
  It may be possible that even competent and decent people 
could be found among the experts who graduated from Soviet 
military schools and who were members of the Communist Party of 
Czechoslovakia. But how realistic is it to expect competence 
and decency from them, after the experience of the past 50 years?

<F P=106> [Article by "(aha)": "The Discovery of Czech Scientists May </F>
Help Cure AIDS"] 
  [Text] Prague--The discovery of a new group of chemical 
substances by scientists from the Department of Chemistry and 
Biochemistry of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in the 
mid-1980's can essentially affect the development of medical 
drugs against AIDS. The new drugs, based on the substance 
developed by the Czech scientists, affects diseases caused by 
the so-called DNA viruses, or retroviruses [retroviry], that 
appear in connection with immune deficiency, particularly in 
AIDS patients and patients who have undergone tissue transplants. 
  "The new preparation should solve, for example, the problem 
of shingles (an eye disease causing blindness), hepatitis, and 
even AIDS. It has an effect on viruses for which medical 
science has no drugs," Antonin Holy, from the Academy of 
Sciences said. Patients would take the drug once a week or at 
longer intervals. 
  The U.S. firm Gilead Sciences from California has obtained a 
license for utilizing the discovery of the Czech scientists and 
is attempting to manufacture the drug. In the United States, 
where the preparation is being tested on AIDS, experts say that 
it really affects the condition of people who suffer from 
full-blown AIDS. Clinical tests of all of the preparations are 
not yet completed.

  [Text] [Announcer] Dariusz Rosati, the prime minister's 
candidate for the post of deputy prime minister and minister of 
finance, told last night's "Panorama" program: I intend to 
withdraw. Last Friday the president would not appoint him to 
Waldemar Pawlak's government. 
  [Rosati] "Having been faced with the decision made by the 
president, I intend to withdraw my candidacy. I am only waiting 
for the possibility of having a conversation with Prime Minister 
Pawlak and Chairman Kwasniewski. I want to inform them about my 
intention to withdraw as a candidate for the post of deputy 
prime minister and minister of finance, and I would like to hear 
their opinions on the subject." 
  [Announcer] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and Aleksander 
Kwasniewski, Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] leader, after a 
one-hour meeting, decided that Dariusz Rosati would remain the 
coalition candidate for the vacant posts. Initially, we 
obtained this information unofficially because the left-wing 
leader [Kwasniewski] left the Council of Ministers' Office by a 
different gate from the one where journalists were waiting for 
him. Later, in the Sejm, Aleksander Kwasniewski locked himself 
in his office. In the end, not seeing any other possibility of 
avoiding talking to media representatives, he left the Sejm 
through a window. 
  Later, however, the leader of the Left answered some 
questions from journalists. 
  [Kwasniewski] "He is still, I say it clearly, the candidate 
of the prime minister and the SLD. There will be talks held on 
this issue shortly. We will see what transpires." 
  [Unidentified correspondent] "Who will the talks be with?" 
  [Kwasniewski] "The president, of course." 
  [Correspondent] We asked Dariusz Rosati if it is possible, 
after a conversation with the coalition leaders, he would change 
his mind and continue as the candidate for the government. 
  [Rosati] "Theoretically, one can imagine such a development 
of the situation and such a fundamental change of circumstances 
that would allow me to remain the candidate. But, let us be 
honest, such a development of the situation is very unlikely. I 
cannot imagine a situation in which the minister of finance and 
deputy prime minister responsible for economic affairs would be 
in conflict with the president." 
  [Correspondent] "Have you considered the possibility of 
withdrawing Mr. Rosati's candidacy and naming Mr. Paga [head of 
the Securities Commission] as a candidate?" 
  [Kwasniewski] "No, we will not withdraw Mr. Rosati's 
candidacy." 
  [Correspondent] "Do you consider Mr. Paga suitable?" 
  [Kwasniewski] "We will not withdraw Mr. Rosati's candidacy."

Rosati's candidacy for the posts of deputy prime minister and 
minister of finance marks the beginning of Lech Walesa's 
presidential campaign. In an interview for Radio Zet, Hall 
described the recent events as another step undermining

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Bazyl Lipszyc: "Rosati Intends To Give Up; </F>
Who Is Next?"] 
  [Text] "I have the intention of withdrawing my candidacy 
very soon," we were told yesterday [28 March] by Dariusz Rosati. 
"I am only waiting for a talk with Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak and Aleksander Kwasniewski. I find it difficult to 
imagine circumstances that would make me change my decision." 
  Dariusz Rosati said that he considered the arguments 
concerning his participation in the affair of the Foreign Debt 
Service Fund [FOZZ], submitted by the president, to be unfair 
and that he would like the prosecutor's office to finally 
complete the investigation because he has had to prove for two 
years now that he is innocent. 
  The Monday communique by the Government's Press Office 
stated 
that Professor Rosati was still the candidate of the coalition 
and the prime minister for deputy prime minister and finance 
minister, "until the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] or Mr. 
Dariusz Rosati himself change their stands on this issue." 
  After a meeting with Waldemar Pawlak that lasted almost two 
hours, Aleksander Kwasniewski would not talk with journalists. 
We merely learned that the prime minister had assured him that 
Rosati was still the candidate for the post of deputy prime 
minister and finance minister. Kwasniewski would not comment on 
Rosati's intention of giving up; he said that he is a serious 
man and that he would not do anything like that without 
previously discussing it. 
  (After the meeting with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, the 
SLD leader spent a few hours in the Sejm. The evening 
"Wiadomosci" and "Panorama" showed Kwasniewski sneaking out of 
the Sejm premises by way of a ladder; however, later on he did 
talk to journalists.) 
  Commenting on the information about the coalition's 
maintaining his candidacy, Prof. Rosati said that he might still 
be a candidate in only one case: if Lech Walesa changed his mind. 
  President's Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski informed PAP that 
the president would very soon forward a reply to the prime 
minister and that "it will be a reply, not a justification, 
because the president does not have to justify this decision--it 
may be made on the basis of his constitutional powers." Andrzej 
Drzycimski stressed that the president's decision is irrevocable 
and stated that he did not know anything about any possible 
meeting between the president and the prime minister concerning 
this issue. 
  Jozef Oleksy said on Radio Zet that he could not imagine the 
SLD's giving up the candidacy of Prof. Rosati. He said that the 
crisis caused by Lech Walesa's rejecting this candidacy was 
"mainly a crisis of ambitions, as well as a political crisis." 
He also stated that this weakened the coalition and the prime 
minister. 
  "If we assume that neither one nor the other party--that is, 
neither the president nor the coalition--will change their 
minds, this is a deadlock and a conflict, which are the least 
necessary here. What we really need are talks that would 
explain what should be explained and that would outline possible 
scenarios because a deadlock or a conflict means a war, and no 
one today needs a war," stated Oleksy. 
  "The resignation of Dariusz Rosati would give us some 
maneuverability; however, in this way, we would lose another 
expert that we pinned enormous hopes on," said SLD Press 
Spokesman Zbigniew Siemiatkowski. 
  Wieslaw Paga is mentioned quite frequently as the new 
candidate for the post of deputy prime minister and finance 
minister. However, now that Paga has received support from Lech 
Walesa, it is not very likely that the SLD will want to have 
another "Belweder-related" minister. No new names are 
mentioned. It may therefore all wind up in the appointment of 
Finance Ministry Director Henryk Chmielak to the post of 
minister; this possibility has also been entertained. One thing 
is certain: The Coalition, mainly the SLD, is stalling for time 
by insisting on the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati. It may well 
mean either that Aleksander Kwasniewski has some new idea or 
that he does not have any idea at all. 
  PAP said that the prosecutor's office had not interrogated 
Dariusz Rosati during the FOZZ investigation, which has lasted 
for over two years now, because it did not consider this 
necessary. The indictment, which was prepared last year, 
includes three members of the Supervisory Board. In November 
1993, the Appellation Court returned the FOZZ documents to the 
prosecutor's office and ordered that the investigation be 
complemented; it ordered, among other things, that Rosati be 
interrogated as a witness. The court did not specify when this 
interrogation should take place.

  [Text] Warsaw, 29 Mar--I am a civil servant who found out 
from the mass media that he allegedly is a candidate for the 
posts of deputy prime minister and minister of finance. I am a 
subject of speculation, but I am not speculating myself, and I 
have no way of balancing all of the elements connected with the 
risk, Leslaw Paga, chairman of the Securities Commission, told 
Radio Eska [Polish private radio station] on Tuesday. 
  On 27 March, Lech Walesa told journalists that he would not 
have anything against Paga's candidacy. "It is very nice that 
the president has a positive opinion about me", Paga said. To 
the question of whether he would like to become deputy prime 
minister, he answered: "I am doing what I am doing, and I hope 
to be able to continue doing it for some time, and, after 
finishing my work for the commission, I would like to work for a 
large bank." 
  I have no way of saying yes or no, Paga replied to the 
question of whether Dariusz Rosati would be a good minister of 
finance. "I do not know him personally, only from earlier press 
articles," he added.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcin Dominik Zdort: "Where President Can Seek </F>
Support; Supporters and Opponents of Lech Walesa"] 
  [Text] Who is still ready today to support the political 
activities of Lech Walesa? Which grouping would be willing to 
support Lech Walesa in next year's presidential elections? The 
conflicts with the government (over Rosati) and the National 
Council of Radio and Television (over Solorz), in which Lech 
Walesa has recently taken part, and the coming presidential 
campaign were an occasion for politicians to specify their 
attitudes toward the present head of state. 
  Walesa can no longer count on support from the Solidarity 
["S"] camp, unless we include the Non-Party Bloc in Support of 
Reforms [BBWR] in it. Even though he has not yet formally 
confirmed that he wants to run in the 1995 elections, he is the 
official candidate of the BBWR. The bloc has so far been... 
<H5>  Unconditionally Loyal </H5>
  ...to the president. Incidentally, the bloc's voters include 
the greatest number of people who approve of the way in which 
the president is now fulfilling his duties. However, it is 
really difficult to say today to what degree Walesa himself 
believes in the possibility of transforming the BBWR into a 
nationwide movement supporting him. 
  The Polish Peasant Party [PSL] has a fairly positive 
attitude 
toward the president. In the conflict over Dariusz Rosati, the 
PSL is trying not to take an unequivocal stand on the issue. 
Even though Prime Minister Pawlak has maintained Rosati's 
candidacy, he did that through Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] 
Chairman Aleksander Kwasniewski. None of the PSL leaders 
officially backed Dariusz Rosati, which gave rise to suspicions 
that Pawlak was playing a double game: He was said "not to 
discourage" Walesa from rejecting the SLD candidate. The 
possibility cannot be ruled out that some PSL leaders think it 
would be a good idea to remove the SLD from the government and 
to establish a minority PSL government that would be supported 
by the president. However, extension of the cooperation between 
the PSL and the Belweder to next year's elections seems rather 
unlikely. It is difficult to suppose that Waldemar Pawlak will 
not want to take advantage of the period of his premiership and 
will not run in the presidential elections against Lech Walesa. 
It should be added here, however, that the president is very... 
<H5>  Popular Among PSL Voters </H5>
  In line with the research carried out by the Sopot Public 
Opinion Research Institute [PBS], as many as 46 percent of rural 
area inhabitants declare support for him. 
  So far, the Confederation for an Independent Poland [KPN] 
has 
not demonstrated its reluctance toward the president. KPN 
deputies backed (along with the Democratic Union--UD--and the 
BBWR) the presidential bill on the procedures of passing the 
Constitution; they also do not conceal the fact that their, just 
like Lech Walesa's, greatest enemy is the SLD. They would be 
ready to take part in establishing a new government under the 
patronage of the president. 
  UD wants to take a position above the dispute between Walesa 
and the SLD. As it often happens in this grouping, one 
unequivocal stand has not been specified; it is known, though, 
that UD is rather on the side of the SLD, whose finance minister 
would probably be inclined to continue the policy of economic 
reforms carried out so far. 
  However, neither UD (rather dissatisfied with recent 
decisions made by Walesa) nor the KPN (approving of the 
activities of the current president) will decide to support 
Walesa in the elections. UD and KPN leaders have presidential 
ambitions themselves. Leszek Moczulski even stated officially 
that, in 1995, he would run for the Belweder. 
  Lech Walesa, who frequently refers to traditional values and 
calls himself a man of the right wing, cannot count on support 
from a party that is so definitely leftist as the Labor Union 
[UP]. Even though we may suspect that Ryszard Bugaj's party 
would not accept some proposals made by Dariusz Rosati (lowering 
taxes, for instance), in the prestige dispute between Aleksander 
Kwasniewski and Lech Walesa it would side with the former. 
Artur Smolko, one of the UP leaders, even called Walesa "a 
president of destabilization." Also, one cannot rule out the 
possibility that, in the coming elections, UP will field its own 
candidate--for example, Aleksander Malachowski. 
  An entirely open war is being waged between Lech Walesa and 
the SLD; some observers believe that this is... 
<H5>  The Initial Stage of the Presidential Campaign </H5>
  ...in which the most dangerous counter-candidate of the 
present head of state may be Aleksander Kwasniewski. Social 
Democracy of the Polish Republic does not intend to be grateful 
to Walesa for "strengthening the left pillar" for a long time; 
it is more likely to remember his "Solidarity" past and his 
fighting against the SLD in the present government. 
  The extraparliamentary right (which the president called 
"screwups") does not intend to back Walesa even in a situation 
where his opponents are postcommunists. Both the members of 
Jaroslaw Kaczynski's bloc and the members of the alliance in 
which Aleksander Hall participates consider Walesa's activities 
to be punishable and likely to cause destabilization in the 
country. However, according to the PBS, the voters of the 
"Fatherland" belong to those who support the way Walesa is 
wielding power. 
  The issue of the future connections between "S" and its 
former chairman is also not clear yet. "S" voters often do not 
have a clear-cut opinion about the president. The president, 
however, has recently been leaning toward "S": Through Lech 
Falandysz, he implied that it was especially for his former 
union that he had proposed "the civic constitutional 
initiative." It is possible that the president, who has 
rejected the free-market-oriented Rosati and who may veto the 
"continuation budget," wants to regain popularity among radical 
union leaders and... 
<H5>  Stand at the Lead of the Mass of People </H5>
  ...marching toward the seat of the government. No one knows 
to what degree the anticommunist "S" will believe in the 
sincerity of Lech Walesa, who is announcing file-checking and 
decommunization; nonetheless, it is one of the few forces that 
might launch a fairly effective campaign supporting the 
president in the elections. 
  Whether or not any of the political groupings will cooperate 
with Lech Walesa depends to a considerable degree on reshuffles 
in the president's closest entourage. When the election 
campaign starts, the Chancellory of the head of the state is 
bound to become a clear political center, which may mean that it 
will gain a party character. It is no secret that, in order to 
win the support of one the parties, such as a large part of the 
right wing or UD, the president would have to abandon the 
services of some of his aides, such as Minister Mieczyslaw 
Wachowski. 
  The Public Opinion Research Center asked its respondents 
about who would make the best president. In line with the data 
published in February, 17 percent of the respondents believe 
that the best president would be Kwasniewski. Walesa came 
fourth, with 9 percent, after Waldemar Pawlak and Krzysztof

  [Text] Arpad Goncz has had talks with Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak and Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrzej 
Olechowski about economic contacts between Poland and Hungary. 
The economic exchange between Budapest and Warsaw dropped 
drastically after the dissolution of the Council for Mutual 
Economic Assistance. Last year, our economic exchange amounted 
to only $330 million. 
  [begin recording] [Andrzej Olechowski] We have two projects 
in common that will have a symbolic significance for our links 
and will give them additional strength. One of them is our 
joint application for full membership in the European Union; the 
Hungarians will do this as early as 1 April, and we will follow 
soon afterwards. The other thing is Partnership for Peace. 
  [Waldemar Pawlak] We have talked about the idea put forward 
by us in Prague: Partnership for Development. We should seek 
cooperation as partners within this region, so that cooperation 
between our countries can make use of both the human potential, 
the potential of friendship, and the potential of our economies. 
[end recording] 
  [Reporter] Tomorrow the Hungarian president will visit 
Poznan.

<F P=106> [Article by W. K.: "Hungarian President's Visit to Poland: </F>
Motion Requesting Membership in Union"] 
  [Text] In the near future, Poland and Hungary will 
introduce motions requesting recognition of their full 
membership in the EU, said Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski 
after his meeting with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz. The 
Hungarian leader began his three-day visit to our state 
yesterday. 
  Hungary will most likely introduce a motion regarding its 
full EU membership by 1 April, and we will do so some time 
later, added the chief of the Polish diplomatic service. He 
also stated that, during an earlier meeting in the Belweder, the 
Polish and the Hungarian presidents discussed, above all, the 
international situation. Arpad Goncz and Lech Walesa agreed 
that their views on the subject coincide entirely, stated 
Olechowski. 
  Both leaders acknowledge that regional cooperation is a "key 
goal" for the Middle and East European states. During his talks 
with Lech Walesa, Hungarian President Arpad Goncz stressed that, 
in addition to centrifugal forces, the Visegrad Group has 
"stable prospects for future development." 
  Discussing cooperation among the Visegrad Group states, 
President Lech Walesa stated that "some [states] do not want to 
achieve some of the goals alone." He added that "not 
everything develops the way we would like it to develop" because 
"we are not doing things together." 
  At the Belweder, the Polish president awarded the Hungarian 
guest with the Order of the White Eagle, and the Hungarian 
president, in his turn, awarded Lech Walesa with the Hungarian 
Great Cross of the Order of Honor. 
  Premier Waldemar Pawlak, who was received by the Hungarian 
president at his residence, said that the subject of their 
meeting was connected with political and economic cooperation 
between the two countries. They also discussed the "Partnership 
for Peace" program. Recalling the negotiations addressing the 
Central European free trade area, the Polish prime minister 
disclosed the wish to speed up the realization of this agreement. 
  President Goncz also met with Marshal of the Sejm Jozef 
Oleksy. The Hungarian leader spoke in favor of the admission of 
Slovenia and Croatia--after the war in former Yugoslavia is 
over--to the Visegrad Group. 
  Minister Olechowski stressed that the "Partnership for 
Peace" 
program and joint efforts of NATO and the Middle and East 
European states to begin cooperating in military areas serve the 
faster rapprochement of the two states. 
  The chief of the Polish diplomatic service added that, 
despite the closeness of their policies, the Hungarian and 
Polish Governments differ in treating ethnic minorities. 
  "If the future of the Visegrad Group depended on only our 
will, it would have developed dynamically," said Olechowski. In 
his opinion, the governments of the two states believe that the 
slowing down of the development within this group is only 
temporary.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Kwasniewski, chairman of Social </F>
Democracy of the Polish Republic, SdRP, by Barbara Czajkowska, 
identified by caption, in Warsaw, on the "Special Line" 
program--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Czajkowska] Good evening to you, ladies and 
gentlemen, and to you, Mr. Sejm Deputy. Welcome. 
  [Kwasniewski] Good evening. 
  [Czajkowska] Recently in Davos [Switzerland], you publicly 
expressed your conviction that you have been handling people's 
frustrations and disappointments--which, according to you, are 
the real danger to the reforms in Poland--the right way. Now, 
what do you mean by saying you have been handling them the right 
way? What do you really mean by saying the SLD [Democratic Left 
Alliance] has been handling our frustrations the right way? 
Results of public opinion polls that are available to society 
do not confirm your optimism. 
  [Kwasniewski] First of all, one must realize that these 
frustrations do indeed exist and that they are justified. 
Millions of people in the country have problems: They are 
unemployed, their retirement pensions and other types of 
pensions and salaries are low... 
  [Czajkowska, interrupting] But we know all that. But my 
question was: What do you mean by saying you have been handling 
it the right way? 
  [Kwasniewski] To handle it the right way means to suggest a 
program that will be changing the situation step by step by 
guaranteeing economic development first of all. This is what I 
talked about in Davos. I think Poland's great chance is the 
fact that last year we saw growth of the GDP of more than 4.5 
percent, and also that, after the first two months of this year, 
we saw a 10-percent increase in production output... 
  [Czajkowska, interrupting] But that is to be attributed 
neither to the SLD nor to the governing coalition. 
  [Kwasniewski] You know, it is to be attributed primarily to 
people. I think that any politician who says this is to be 
attributed only to him is dishonest. But the fact is that, if 
these are the trends, they must be preserved and protected. And 
that is our biggest chance. So, when you remember the difficult 
budget we argued about, which the SLD took upon its shoulders, 
as it were, because the budget had been proposed by the then 
Finance Minister Borowski, and then we fought for the budget in 
the Sejm, the goal of all that was, step by step and while 
protecting the developmental trends in the economy, to create a 
chance to meet halfway those people who are frustrated and who 
have good reason to feel so. 
  [Czajkowska] So when you said in Davos that the SLD has been 
handling things the right way, you simply meant all of the 
governments that ruled the country after 1989? 
  [Kwasniewski] Even more than that. What I also meant was 
all the good in the country that we managed to create since the 
beginning of Poland's existence because it is my view that 
Poland began neither in 1989 nor in 1945. The point is simply 
to do in Poland whatever can bring us success and to avoid doing 
those things that contribute to our problems. That is my 
philosophy, as it were, the philosophy of a politician and the 
philosophy of a man. My view is that one must look for positive 
aspects and good solutions while avoiding bad ones, and that is 
why I regret many things that take place in our country and that 
I evaluate as bad things. 
  [Czajkowska] And I hope this is what we will talk about in 
the program tonight and also that we get your replies as to how 
you think these difficult problems should be solved. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Czajkowska] Sir, one does not have to be particularly 
observant to see that the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] is clearly 
being favored over the SLD. When the president, for instance, 
warned against greedy communists, he clearly meant the SLD. 
There is talk among people that the presidential constitutional 
initiative was rejected by Sejm deputies for the SLD, even 
though everyone knows that Sejm deputies for the PSL also voted 
against. Even Solidarity attacks the SLD while clearly taking 
an easy-going attitude--forgive me for using that popular 
term--toward the PSL. All that is not just a coincidence. What 
is your assessment? 
  [Kwasniewski] You know, of course it is not just a 
coincidence. It can be concluded from this, that we [SLD] 
exist, while, in the year... 
  [Czajkowska, interrupting] But the PSL also exists. 
  [Kwasniewski] Yes, but the point is that, back in 1990, when 
the PSL was being born out of the old United Peasant Party, it 
was of marginal importance, as it were, and no one had any 
particular grievance against them because of that, whereas the 
SLD, or, actually, Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, 
which was being born in the spring of 1990, was confronted by 
the president's argument in which he said we will be finished 
within three months. Not only have the three months been going 
on and on for a long time now, but we also won the elections; 
let me remind you that we won the September elections by quite a 
big margin, to be quite honest, even though before, right-wing 
activists had been ascribing us the role of what they call 
postcommunist, or communist, remnants. 
  [Czajkowska] But the PSL is your coalition partner. 
  [Kwasniewski] Fine, but I will not say even one unfavorable 
word about the PSL tonight. Please, do not force me to do that. 
  [Czajkowska] I am not forcing you to do that. I am just 
asking whether there are clear.... 
  [Kwasniewski, interrupting] They are our coalition partner 
whom we treasure and with whom we want to cooperate. 
  [Czajkowska] That is fine with me. 
  [Kwasniewski] But, if you allow me to, I would like to 
finish my thought on why there are so many attacks against the 
left wing and the SLD, in particular coming from the president. 
  [Czajkowska] Actually, I meant the PSL being clearly 
favored--that is the term our viewers used. 
  [Kwasniewski] Fine, let it be so. The reason is that the 
SLD is disliked because we have shown that, through a peaceful 
exchange of arguments, lack of aggressiveness, and rational 
ideas, one can simply gain social confidence and win elections. 
I think that very many people on the right wing--and also, 
unfortunately, the president, I say with sorrow--still find it 
very hard to come to terms with the fact that we who had been 
condemned to be a marginal phenomenon--some even said we belong 
on history's rubbish heap--right now are winners in the 
elections, form a governing coalition, and, moreover, when you 
read Western newspapers, you can see that we are actually 
guarantors of the Polish democratic and free-market reforms. 
And I think that is the right perception. After all we went 
through, including some very personal experiences, we are very 
deeply convinced that there is no going back for Poland. I mean 
we cannot give up democracy, the free market, or our openness to 
the world. When it comes to our coalition partner, well, all I 
can say is that I envy the PSL a bit in that all groups have 
favorable opinions of the party. Both the Democratic Union and 
the Confederation for an Independent Poland have courted the 
PSL, as the president is doing now. But apparently the left 
wing is not suited to play the role of one who is courted. 
  [Czajkowska] And do you not think, Mr. Chairman, that 
perhaps you yourselves are to blame for the PSL's being favored 
this way? From the very beginning of this coalition, the SLD 
has actually been teasing the PSL by trying to sermonize to it, 
by warning it, and by placing yourselves at the top of the 
reforms process--you said that yourself tonight, by the way--and 
by seeing in the PSL's measures a danger to the reforms. 
Recently, SLD spokesman Mr. Siemiatkowski made a comparison 
between Chairman Kwasniewski and a messiah who is supposed to 
lead the nation to a successful future without any problems. Is 
that not too much? 
  [Kwasniewski] Of course, that was a lot, and perhaps it was 
too much, but, as far as I can recall, that interview by Mr. 
Siemiatkowski, he spoke there about the left wing. I think 
that, in that sense, what the left wing has gone through.... 
[Kwasniewski pauses] Of course, I am the kind of man.... 
  [Czajkowska, interrupting] Are you trying to suggest that, 
when Mr. Siemiatkowski spoke about the left wing, he also meant 
the PSL? 
  [Kwasniewski] No, I think he meant us, the political group 
that is us, and also.... 
  [Czajkowska, interrupting] But it is you who was described 
as a Moses in that statement. 
  [Kwasniewski] So is it a Moses or a messiah? 
  [Czajkowska] I am sorry. I confused the two. 
  [Kwasniewski] Please, do not.... 
  [Czajkowska, interrupting] I think I am not the one you 
should address but rathe, Sejm Deputy Siemiatkowski, who 
described you this way. 
  [Kwasniewski, hesitating] You know, that is of course a 
metaphor, and let us approach it that way. But there is no 
doubt that, when it comes to the left wing in the country, as I 
said, we managed to overcome the condemnation of a political 
nonexistence and become one of the ruling parties. Of course, 
that is by no means to be attributed to only me personally, but, 
on the other hand--let us not be too modest here--I think I 
played some part in the process. Very many people played a 
positive role, and attacks by some others were also helpful to 
us. But that is a closed chapter, and it is not the most 
important thing. The most important thing is what you asked me 
about our coalition partner. Well, my view is that there is no 
alternative, given the political configuration that was 
established after September of last year. Of course, we could 
get theoretical here in a number of ways, but the truth remains 
that the PSL-SLD coalition is creating a chance in Poland for a 
stable government based on a majority, for the first time in 
many months or even years. And one must.... 
  [Czajkowska, interrupting] Forgive me for interrupting, but 
this is not what I meant. 
  [Kwasniewski] So what did you mean? 
  [Czajkowska] Let me refresh your memory: I am not willing 
to question the principles of the coalition's existence or the 
PSL's participation in it. All I am saying is that the favoring 
of the PSL at the expense of the SLD, which we talked about 
earlier, is perhaps caused--or at least there are such views--by 
the SLD's own behavior inasmuch as the party sermonizes to the 
PSL, teases it, tells it what to do, as if condemning the PSL to 
play a secondary role, which means the SLD leads the reforms. 
By the way, you yourself said that here tonight. 
  [Kwasniewski] No, all I said was that we are absolutely in 
favor of the reforms that are taking place. As far as our 
coalition partner is concerned, we treat the PSL with all 
seriousness and in the most thorough manner possible, even 
though cooperation is of course difficult. One must be honest 
about that. There would be no problems or conflicts if the 
cooperation were perfect. As regards the sermonizing, of course 
I can be self-critical here and say that we are not without 
guilt here and that many things have been said unnecessarily, 
that is for sure. But, on the other hand, I also think that too 
many measures by our coalition partner have not been completely 
understood or accepted by us. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw </F>
Kaczmarek by Ada Kostrz-Kostecka; place and date not given: "Is 
There a Danger of Paralysis of Foreign Investment in 
Privatization?"] 
  [Text] [Kostrz-Kostecka] Just three capital privatizations 
have taken place since the beginning of the year: the sale of 
the Goleniow Furniture Factory, the Dzialoszyn Cement Plant, and 
the Sugar Products "San" plant. Are you not afraid that 
revenues from privatization, which were included in the budget 
law for this year, may not be realized? 
  [Kaczmarek] No, I am not. It is enough to just take a look 
at revenues from the sale of the Sugar Products San plant, which 
are over 600 billion zlotys. More privatization projects are 
being prepared, and another big transaction is under negotiation. 
  [Kostrz-Kostecka] There is a debate going on currently, 
which, on the one hand, concerns who is supposed to make the 
privatization decisions, and, on the other, expresses a desire 
to limit foreign investment. Does that debate not contribute to 
foreign capital being less interested in our country? 
  [Kaczmarek] Recently, there have been more and more cases of 
politics and economics going their own separate ways. And I am 
sorry to say this, but I think one cannot worry over various 
statements because there is no danger of paralysis in these 
investments. I also think that foreign investors who are 
interested in Poland do not take such views seriously, either. 
The number of questions on companies being privatized is proof 
of that. What is important is what the U.S. Commerce Department 
said on 28 January, when it presented an analysis of countries 
with the highest investment potential and developmental 
possibilities over the next several years. In the European 
market, only Poland and Turkey were named; in Asia--China, 
Malaysia, Indonesia, and South Korea, and, in South 
America--Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. The London Club's 
behavior is another positive message because it is proof of 
their conviction that we are stable. 
  [Kostrz-Kostecka] But, if a division of privatization powers 
were to take place, which was sought during a debate on a new 
privatization law, among others, by the Industry, Foreign 
Economic Cooperation, and Transportation Mjinistries, that could 
make the entry of foreign investors more difficult. 
  [Kaczmarek] I think this is more about being in power just 
for the sake of it, rather than about implementing specific 
strategic privatization goals. I would understand taking such 
measures if we had a specific policy for reconstructing foreign 
trade, an industrial policy, a policy of reconstructing 
different branches, and if the point was to have power to 
implement these goals. But we have no such programs. I spoke 
with Minister Pol and think his goal is to look for solutions 
with the aim of carrying out a policy of commercialization, 
which, for him, is clearly separate from privatization, and I 
agree with him on that. But I disagree with the view that 
privatization is to be implemented at specific ministries. I 
think we do not appreciate the fact that, for a foreign 
investor, a "green fields" situation--that is, building a 
factory from scratch--is more worthwhile. The tobacco industry 
is a classic example, where specific forces do not allow for 
privatization of state-owned tobacco plants, but Reynolds will 
build a factory from scratch. Or, to cite a different 
branch--Philips, which is building a battery and car-battery 
plant. There are more and more examples indicating that foreign 
investors prefer to build from scratch instead of restructuring 
state-owned companies. 
  [Kostrz-Kostecka] Is the Ownership Transformations 
Ministry not to blame a bit for the fact that decisions about 
selling companies, particularly to foreign investors, take so 
much time? My feeling is that, especially in those cases, one 
seeks assurances in the form of many documents, so as to 
eliminate in due course anyone having reservations about the 
transaction. After all, the sales that were recently 
implemented were prepared over a long period of time. 
  [Kaczmarek] I do not think that is the case. Usually, the 
process takes quite a long time, usually six to nine months, and 
you must also take into account the big replacement level of 
staff in the ministry, which is not conducive to decisionmaking, 
either. Consider also that, in such cases, there is practically 
no tolerance for making mistakes, and that is why everything is 
examined very carefully several times. Volumes of contracts are 
getting bigger and bigger, compared with the initial ones, 
which, by the way, were done in pioneer fashion and thus were 
definitely far from perfect. Even if there is a provision in a 
contract, which by the way is a positive thing--such as in the 
case of the San factory--to the effect that the investor does 
not conduct any talks that could possibly influence his 
investment policies vis-a-vis San, that means that proper 
conclusions have been drawn from past experiences. 
  [Kostrz-Kostecka] Many new investors may emerge as a result 
of the implementation of the National Investment Funds [NFI] 
program. When can we expect them? 
  [Kaczmarek] Hearings before the Selection Commission of 
candidates for companies managing the investment funds have been 
completed, and, right now, financial offers are being evaluated. 
So the time schedule is being observed; we are even ahead of 
it. A ranking of companies based on individual scores could be 
presented as early as the first half of April. After getting to 
know the documents and opinions of the commission's individual 
members, I will be able to select some companies, with the 
proviso that the commission will suggest to me a certain order 
to be followed. There will probably be 15 funds, so this is how 
many companies will be needed. The commission also reviews 
offers by candidates for members of governing boards. Because 
there are 6,800 candidates, I agreed with the commission's 
chairman that a certain selection must be done, which would be 
guided by accepted criteria, and that about 800 people must be 
selected. Then, about 200 people will be selected after talks, 
and, from among them, I will select 105 representatives of the 
Treasury. 
  [Kostrz-Kostecka] What kinds of guarantees are there that 
really good companies will be selected that would first 
restructure the companies covered by the program and then 
privatize them successfully? In your selection, do you intend 
to be guided by the companies' size and reputation or by their 
familiarity with the market? There are, for instance, several 
little-known companies that have already done some things in 
Poland and know the situation, but, on the other hand, it is 
possible that there will be cases of "Marriott brigades," 
meaning that a well-known company sends over young employees to 
see whether they fit. If they do not, there is no big loss for 
the company because Poland is a marginal market for the company 
anyway. 
  [Kaczmarek] The mechanism goes both ways because there are, 
for instance, little-known companies that use the names of 
several dozen famous people on their list of references, but, in 
fact, these people do not participate in the project in 
question. Only the wisdom and skills of the commission members 
can prevent such mistakes from happening. I think the program is 
popular enough that a company of some reputation will not be 
willing to risk losing it. As for the "Marriott brigades" 
description, it was applied more often in cases involving 
certain consulting companies. Investment banks that are taken 
into account in that case tended not to participate in the 
"brigades" because the banks have been watching Poland only from 
a distance up to now. So, in that case, the point is to create 
new institutions of the capital market. That is one of the goals 
of the NFI program. 
  [Kostrz-Kostecka] What kind of supervision will there be 
over the companies' activities after the program is implemented, 
funds are established, and contracts with managing companies are 
signed? Could it not happen that they will immediately sell a 
majority of companies at low prices because they will think it 
not worthwhile to restructure them? 
  [Kaczmarek] Reservations contained in the contracts prohibit 
the sale of companies during a specified period of time, so that 
would be a breach of contract. But one obviously cannot rule 
out the possibility of a bankruptcy emerging in that group, in 
which case something will have to be done. Perhaps it will be 
necessary to sell one bad company to get the money to 
restructure some other companies.

<F P=106> [Report by Kalina Stancheva on a statement by Prime Minister </F>
Lyuben Berov on domestic issues for Bulgarian Radio, Television, 
and BTA; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Lyuben Berov has made a statement 
for Bulgarian National Radio, Television, and BTA on topical 
domestic problems. The "Khorizont" program will transmit the 
statement later, but here is a summary by our reporter Kalina 
Stancheva: 
  [Stancheva] The prime minister has the impression that a new 
campaign to topple the government has begun. In his statement 
he disclosed the composite elements of the campaign and offered 
his explanation as to why the action was starting just at this 
moment. The first reason, he said, was that the two trade union 
confederations had reached a common position regarding their 
property. Prime Minister Berov said that the deadline of 1 
September can be kept without any ultimatum. A furor is being 
raised at this juncture because one of the two trade union 
leaders is having difficulties with his membership. According 
to Berov, the problem will be resolved before the end of August. 
Professor Berov described as a gross falsehood [Podkrepa 
leader] Trenchev's allegation that secret talks were being held 
with the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] on replacing individual 
members of the cabinet and striking political bargains. 
  The second groundless accusation was that the Council of 
Ministers is neglecting to provide bread for the people, the 
prime minister said. He said that the ban on the export of 
grain will remain in force until the new harvest is brought in. 
Because of the threatened shortage of vegetable oil, we have 
increased the export duty on sunflower seed and their products, 
he said. 
  Prof. Berov that the government was further accused of 
supplying water without charge to Turkey, but in fact Turkey is 
paying three times the price paid by Bulgarian consumers. 
  The prime minister further said he could not understand why 
the trade unions had come out against the mass privatization. 
Furthermore, Dr. Kurtev [chief secretary of National 
Coordinating Council of Union of Democratic Forces] has accused 
the government of attempts to introduce a state of emergency. 
The prime minister said that at 1200 on Friday 1 April he will 
give a news conference, to which -- and here I quote Prof. 
Berov's words -- I invite Dr. Trenchev, bringing with him the 
damning tape recording that he claims to have in his possession. 
In addition, I invite Mr. Kurtev, Mrs. Mozer [leader of 
Bulgarian National Agrarian Union], and Mr. Spasov to attend, 
bringing with them the list of villages in which they claim 
recommunization is being carried out in the liquidation councils. 
  The prime minister offered the following explanation why 
political groupings of various colors were mounting their attack 
against his cabinet at this moment: It is because the cabinet 
is determined to fulfill in a responsible way its program for 
mass privatization, as well as agrarian reform, and to wage a 
determined campaign against economic crime.

  [Text] An agreement between the Romanian Ministry of 
National Defense and the Ministry of Defense of the Russian 
Federation was signed in Bucharest this afternoon. The document 
was signed by Gheorghe Dinca, Romanian minister of national 
defense, and Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian minister of 
defense, who arrived today in Bucharest. 
  The two ministers believe today's agreement marks a new 
stage 
in Romanian-Russian relations. In this respect, General Pavel 
Grachev told our radio station that this accord also marks the 
end of the period of stagnation that emerged in relations 
between the two countries after the dismemberment of the former 
Soviet Union and the revolution in Romania. The document signed 
in Bucharest today, the Russian guest said, is a framework 
agreement that pertains to all aspects of military cooperation, 
including technical-military cooperation, thus presupposing 
normal relations between two neighboring countries. 
  Gheorghe Tinca said that this accord creates a normal 
framework for ties between the two neighboring countries and is 
not directed against anybody else. This is the 15th document of 
military cooperation concluded by Romania with neighboring and 
other European countries. 
  This evening the Russian guest also met with Romanian 
Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu. After the meeting the Romanian 
minister of foreign affairs told journalists that he considers 
General Grachev's visit to be a signal for the relaunching of 
relations between Russia and Romania.

  [Text] A complete solution to the problems in southeast 
Europe will not be possible without leading EU [European Union] 
members and the Russian Federation, and especially not without 
the prominent and decisive role of the United States. Dr. Mate 
Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign minister, 
said this when he submitted a report on the Washington 
agreements to the Croatian Parliament's Chamber of Deputies. 
Here is a report by Jasminka Dudic: 
  [Dudic] With the Washington agreements we are entering a new 
era of relations with the world. It is our view that we have 
real prospects and guarantees that we will in future resolve our 
aspirations and difficulties with the help and support of the 
international community. The doors to inclusion in both the 
Council of Europe and the EU, entry into the Partnership for 
Peace initiative, and financial support from the world are 
opening for us, Dr. Granic said. 
  After recalling the road of the Croatian president and of 
our 
foreign policy which led to the Washington agreements, Dr. 
Granic stressed that the path ahead of us will not be simple and 
that now, in the negotiations on the resolution of the crisis in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina, the Serb side should also be included. 
  Speaking about the resolution of the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the reintegration of the UNPA [UN 
Protected Area] zones, Dr. Granic also said: 
  [Begin Granic recording] We have firm guarantees that the 
sanctions, the possible alleviation of them, or even their 
substitution will be and will remain a crucial means for 
achieving a just and satisfactory solution both in Croatia and 
in Bosnia- Herzegovina. In other words, sanctions will continue 
to remain in place as a punishment but also as a stimulus and as 
a signal to the Serb side, in other words to Belgrade, that this 
is now an exceptionally favorable moment for the achievement of 
a global solution and for a new leaf to be turned. [end 
recording] 
  [Dudic] The Croatian signature on the Washington documents 
is 
an expression of the continuity of Croatian state policy 
vis-a-vis the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the legitimate 
aspirations of the Croat people. However, on the consequences 
of the unpreparedness of the international community to put a 
stop to the Serb aggression and ethnic cleansing, Dr. Granic 
said: 
  [Begin Granic recording] These have led to phenomena of the 
exacerbation of the circle of distrust and a conflict of 
interests even amongst the victims of the Greater Serb 
aggression. The violation of international and war law, which 
has occurred on both sides and which further deepened tensions, 
should not be forgotten either. Serious clashes took place 
between members of the Croat and Muslim Bosniak nations, and 
these became ever more destructive both for the relations 
between these two nations and also for the future of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state, for the unity of the Croatian 
nation, and for the position of the Republic of Croatia in the 
world. 
  In the struggle against the Serb aggressor, the Croat nation 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina developed its own armed forces as well as 
its own institutions of power in the form of the Croat republic 
of Herceg-Bosna, and it expressed its awareness that future 
resolutions of its position must be developed, starting from the 
principles of full respect for its sovereign will in those areas 
where for centuries it has been the majority population. The 
Republic of Croatia was not able to remain indifferent to the 
other sides in respect of the ever more explicit danger for the 
whole of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [end recording] 
  [Dudic] The foreign minister also dwelled in detail on the 
strategic importance of the agreements and documents signed and 
said, among other things, that the preliminary agreement starts 
clearly from the separate identities of two states which do not 
intend to rush into the immediate creation of a confederation, 
but go for cooperation in the economic and defense fields. The 
Croatian leadership will persevere in its policies to achieve 
the reintegration of the UNPA zones, in other words the peaceful 
option, but, Dr. Granic stressed, we cannot accept the 
continuation and intensification of the current situation for 
the forseeable future. He repeated Croatian demands connected 
with changes to and the greater effectiveness of UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces]. He also stressed that in future we will link 
the process of the normalization of relations with the FRY with 
progress in the process of the reintegration of temporarily 
occupied territory into the overall systems of the Republic of 
Croatia. 
  At the end of his address, Dr. Granic once again recalled 
that the basic aims of our overall policy -- including our 
foreign policy -- remain unchanged and that in this process we 
are remaining faithful to a firm orientation toward Europe. A 
debate on the report on the Washington agreements is under way 
in the Chamber of Deputies.

<F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic to the Assembly of </F>
the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Sarajevo on 28 March -- 
live] 
  [Text] Esteemed Deputies: [words indistinct] that this 
session of the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina will have the 
significance of a political event that will lead us into 
qualitative [word indistinct] of the struggle against aggression 
and the new stage of the peace process, as well as a new period 
of life. 
  The agreements reached in Washington have already yielded 
the 
first effects -- first of all, on the fields in central Bosnia, 
Herzegovina, and other regions mostly populated by Bosniaks and 
Croats. One of the results of the Washington agreement is this 
Assembly session, which is competent to verify the agreements 
and consistently implement them. 
  Many and partly contradictory assessments have already been 
made about the agreement by domestic and world politicians, 
journalists, and other observers. These assessments range from 
the extremely positive and optimistic, which see the agreements 
as an historic turning point in the solving of the crisis in the 
former Yugoslavia, to the negative and pessimistic, which see 
the agreement as just one more paper that will not bring any 
essential change to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I 
think that at this moment one should not waste much time or 
effort on seeking and assessing attributes by which the 
agreements will be qualified. 
  Put simply, with this agreement, a very important step has 
been made toward a permanent and just solution to the situation 
in which our country finds itself. A realistic concept has been 
defined and certain prerequisites for implementing it have been 
ensured. However, it will be possible to assess objectively the 
significance and value of the work done in Washington only when 
the full effects of the agreement are seen. It is not the time 
for euphoria or pessimism, but for extremely serious, 
responsible, and intensive work on implementing the agreement 
and seeking the solutions for those questions that the 
agreements have left open. 
  There are many valid reasons for reaching the agreements and 
I will present only several of the most important ones. 
  First, these agreements represent a basis for the speedy 
establishment of peace and the normalization of the situation, 
above all in those regions populated mostly by the Bosniak and 
Croatian people and open the door to the so-called Serbian side; 
they therefore present the possibility of a permanent and just 
political solution for the entire territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Second, these agreements represent a defeat for the strategy 
of the Serbian aggressor, who in fact reckoned on the rift 
between the Bosniaks and the Croats and who profited most from 
the incitement of the conflict. By overcoming the conflict, 
reaching the agreements and implementing them, one creates an 
extremely important strategic balance, which significantly 
reduces the room for maneuver of the extremist and aggressive 
Serbian nationalism, thereby rendering the project of a Greater 
Serbia historically without prospects. 
  Third, [words indistinct] a significant step toward 
annulling 
the consequences of ethnic cleansing, because by adopting them 
one creates the political and legal prerequisites for the return 
of the refugees and displaced people to their homes, and by 
implementing them one ensures the realistic conditions for this. 
  Fourth, in realizing these agreements one relatively quickly 
opens the road for forming links with the Western world, above 
all through the status of associate member of the European 
Union, if we manage this, and with NATO within the Partnership 
for Peace. One does not need much political wisdom or knowledge 
to appreciate the importance of this prospect, so the chance 
should not be missed. 
  Fifth, the war devastation has had catastrophic consequences 
and the removal or recovery of these requires huge resources. 
Without the help of the developed world, the process of 
renewal, reconstruction, and development is almost unimaginable. 
  The concluded agreements and their implementation will 
render much more realistic our chances to receive the justly 
expected help. Finally, these agreements have been fully 
endorsed by the United States, the European Union, and many 
countries and international organizations. 
  This support is not only of a theoretical and verbal nature, 
but expresses a readiness to guarantee the agreements and to 
support their implementation with concrete measures and 
instruments, including the appropriate arrangements with the 
peacekeeping forces. 
  We therefore have the right to expect from the international 
community, and above all the United States, to do what is 
necessary to implement the project made with their support and 
help. Therefore, these are some of the more important reasons 
and goals that we had in mind when we concluded the Washington 
Agreement. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, deputies, allow me briefly to say 
something about some sections that go to make up the package of 
agreements, that is, the constitutional project of the 
federation, the preliminary agreement on the principles of the 
future confederation, the arrangement concerning the right of 
the Republic of Croatia to cross the Neum commune and the same 
right of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina concerning the lease 
of the port of Ploce, as well as the military agreement 
concluded in Split, which is an integral part of the package. 
  Regarding the constitutional project for establishing the 
federation, this project obviously represents the most 
acceptable answer to the question: How should the state be 
organized according to the needs of the citizens and people who 
live in this region? Relations within the federation are founded 
on the full equality of the Bosniak and Croatian peoples and the 
equality of all citizens. The organization of the federal and 
cantonal authorities consistently expresses these principles. 
  The duties of the federation are adequately defined and 
provide the absolutely necessary level of political and economic 
integration for the existence and functioning of the federal 
state. At the same time, a high degree of decentralization and 
the transfer of numerous powers of the state to the federal 
units and cantons, and the appropriate solutions on determining 
territories of the federal units have instantly eliminated all 
reasons for conflicts and clashes, save pretensions for conquest 
and separating parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The cantons as federal units are not defined exclusively 
according to the ethnic principle, because this is simply 
impossible in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of course there will be 
cantons in which the Bosniaks or the Croats will make up 80 
percent and cantons where this ratio will be almost 50-50 
percent. 
  In either case, both the Bosniaks and the Croats are 
constituent nations, which means that a Croat or a Bosniak 
cannot be in a minority in any part of the federation, 
regardless of the number of members of that nation in a 
particular region. Therefore, the cantons are not to be 
considered exclusively national territories of either nation. 
Every federal unit is joint, as is the federation. 
  Regarding the constitutional project of the federation, 
there 
was full unanimity and I think that the act of adopting and 
promulgating the constitution will be [word indistinct]. 
Regarding the adoption of the constitution and the realization 
of provisional solutions, I will make some proposals later. 
  Regarding the preliminary agreement on the principles of the 
future confederation, I think that these principles have been 
defined in such a way that they completely guarantee the respect 
of all the state attributes of the federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as the Republic of Croatia. The 
federation will not lose any of its characteristics regarding 
its sovereignty with the conclusion of the confederal agreement. 
  On the other hand, both the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and the Republic of Croatia, within the confederal relationship, 
are creating wide and firm prerequisites for the achievement of 
capital, economic, defense, and other interests. 
  Neither side is going into this confederal relationship 
blind. On the contrary, it has been envisaged that specific 
relations in every sphere be defined by separate agreements. 
The confederation is simply an expression of the real interests 
of the people and citizens, two states, and only as such can it 
be created and survive. 
  In this context is also the arrangement concerning the 
regime 
of crossing parts of the [Neum) commune, which is identical to 
the right of Bosnia-Herzegovina, that is, the regime of crossing 
the territory of the Republic of Croatia to the port of Ploce. 
This arrangement is of mutual interest and represents an 
expression of mutual understanding and confidence building. The 
principle of reciprocity has in this case been fully respected, 
too. 
  Finally, regarding the military agreement, one should state 
that it is already being implemented according to a set pace, 
and that the results so far achieved are within expectations. 
Contacts are being held at the highest military level at which 
answers are successfully being found to the majority of 
outstanding issues. (?Of course), the final success of the full 
implementation of the military agreement depends to a great 
extent on steps to be taken in the sphere of politics. We must 
bear this in mind all the time when we hold political talks and 
make political decisions. 
  Therefore, in general, the agreements concluded represent a 
sound basis and an important step toward final, lasting, and 
just solutions. Although certain positive effects are already 
being felt, one must nevertheless bear in mind that their 
implementation is yet to come. This is a very (?responsible) 
and very complex and delicate job. [words indistinct] 
psychological, emotional barriers, calming of passions, and 
(?extremism) of all kinds. 
  This is not a call to forget or forgive. Crimes, regardless 
of who has committed them, cannot and must not be forgotten, nor 
can the perpetrators remain unpunished. Our future is not and 
cannot be made of only memories of crimes and injustice. Hating 
crime and criminals is understandable, but hating entire nations 
is a crime in itself. 
  The peoples on this territory have always been able to and 
wanted to live together; this is our future. I am not implying 
just the Bosniaks and Croats alone, but the Serbs as well. On 
this basis, there is an open invitation for the Serbs to join 
the agreement and live in the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
like other peoples under the same conditions and with the same 
rights. 
  In any case, we will know how to respect those members of 
the 
Serbian nation who did not side with the perpetrators of crimes, 
especially those who actively contributed to the struggle 
against the aggression, the struggle for joint freedom and a 
joint state. They will most certainly not be second-class 
citizens, nor will members of all the other peoples. (?In) the 
democratic society that we want to build, there is no place for 
second-class citizens. 
  Esteemed deputies, although agreement has already been 
reached on the essential issues, we are still facing numerous 
decisions that will be neither simple nor easy to make. Not 
because some people here want disagreements, but simply because 
the answers that need to be found are not simple and easy. I 
think that the very act of adopting and promulgating the 
constitution of a federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, although the 
most important, represents the easiest part of the work, 
considering the consent that has already been achieved. 
  However, our aim is not only to adopt the constitution, but 
also to implement it quickly, consistently, and fully. To 
achieve this we urgently need to find and synchronize a certain 
number of legal, organizational, and staff solutions that must 
promptly follow the adoption of the constitution. 
  The transitional solutions include tight but (?manageable) 
deadlines if an agreement on some essential issues is reached in 
advance. Therefore, I consider important the proposal that 
within the discussion on the constitutional project we bring 
into line the views and opinions on those issues that need to be 
decided upon the adoption of the constitution. This is not some 
kind of political condition, but simply a practical approach to 
the realization of the established concept. 
  The transitional provisions envisage that the Assembly elect 
a transitional president and vice president of the federation 
and appoint a government immediately after the adoption of the 
constitution. The setting up of cantonal bodies is envisaged to 
take place within 30 days. The countdown to these deadlines 
will start with the adoption of the constitution and it would 
not be good if we found ourselves in a situation where these 
deadlines had not been met. 
  Therefore, I consider it important that the Assembly hold a 
continuous session so that solutions on which the realization of 
the constitution depend in this transitional period are found 
and synchronized, and that we then adopt the constitution. 
  Of course, a different order of moves is possible. This will 
finally be decided by the Assembly. Whatever the decision, we 
rightly believe that the all the participants in the work of the 
Assembly will be profoundly aware of our responsibility before 
our peoples, our citizens, the international community, God and 
the people, as it is commonly said. 
  Therefore, I appeal to you on behalf of the Government of 
the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to (?support) and endorse the 
agreements that have been reached, and to invest all your energy 
in implementing them consistently and efficiently. Thank you.

  [Excerpts] President Lech Walesa finally rejected the 
candidacy of Dariusz Rosati for deputy prime minister and 
finance minister, which was submitted to him on Friday [25 
March] morning by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak. After holding 
talks with Aleksander Kwasniewski, the prime minister and the 
coalition still maintain this candidacy. If the president 
officially maintains his stand, the dispute over Rosati will 
turn into a dispute between the president and the governing 
coalition.

  On Friday morning, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak submitted 
to the president the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati for the post of 
deputy prime minister and finance minister. During the 
20-minute meeting, the prime minister's visit to Moscow as well 
as personnel changes in the Finance Ministry were also discussed. 
  After the meeting, President's Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski 
said that the president would not sign Dariusz Rosati's 
nomination because he can see "a double risk. Mr. Rosati may 
not know Polish reality well enough" due to his three-year stay 
abroad, which may make it difficult for him to make economic 
decisions, and his knowledge on the economy may to a 
considerable degree "depend on secondhand information." The 
other reason is "the affair of the Foreign Debt Service Fund. 
The legal situation is not completed yet. Legal proceedings 
are under way, the case has been started, and there may arise 
relations that are unnecessary in this difficult situation in 
which we have found ourselves." 
  Minister Drzycimski also said that the president believes 
that the filling of the highest posts in the state calls for 
great deliberation, and, in view of the doubts that have arisen, 
he cannot accept this candidacy. 
  "The decision that Dariusz Rosati's candidacy will not be 
accepted is irrevocable," Andrzej Drzycimski told RZECZPOSPOLITA 
on Friday. On Monday, the president will forward a written 
reply to Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak's motion; however, the 
document will not include any justification of the decision 
because the Constitution does not impose such a duty. The 
Belweder's spokesman did not rule out the possibility, however, 
that, on the very same day, a meeting may be held between the 
president and the prime minister. "Nevertheless, it is 
impossible for the president to change his mind. The coalition 
should agree on a new candidate for deputy prime minister and 
finance minister." 
  Walesa's spokesman emphasized that propaganda pressure was 
exerted on the president. "It was completely forgotten that, in 
line with the Constitution, he does not have to confirm such a 
candidacy because it is the president who is responsible for 
making the decision, which may in the future turn out to be 
erroneous." 
<H5>  The Coalition Is Adamant and Waiting </H5>
  "For us, it is not a matter of prestige or having our own 
man 
in the government; it has to be a person who will implement the 
government's economic program and the budget," said Aleksander 
Kwasniewski. "We should act efficiently and wisely; I cannot 
understand how one can delay making decisions and, not having 
any arguments against, disagree to such a candidacy." He said 
that the arguments that delay the decision on the appointment or 
that make it impossible were false and wrong. He confirmed that 
the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] had not withdrawn the 
candidacy of Dariusz Rosati because, "if an outstanding 
specialist is not a good candidate, who is a good one"? 
  After an hour's meeting with Waldemar Pawlak, Kwasniewski 
officially declared that the prime minister maintained the 
candidacy of Dariusz Rosati because he believes he is an expert, 
well-prepared and competent enough to become responsible for the 
economic issues in the government. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Between Coalition and President </H5>
  Now that the coalition has worked out a common stand, the 
prime minister is waiting for an official reply from the 
president. If he maintains his stand, "we will witness a new 
stage of the political situation," said Kwasniewski. However, 
it will no longer be an internal affair of the coalition but an 
affair between the coalition and the president. According to 
Drzycimski, by rejecting the presidential bill concerning the 
Constitution, it was the coalition that opened a new chapter in 
relations with the Belweder. Now the SLD leader would like the 
president to lose because of Rosati. 
  "We must try to reach agreement. Now, if the president 
decides on such a war, we will have to think about whether the 
president's powers are not too great. There are no regulations 
that cannot be changed, including the Constitution," said Marek 
Borowski. 
  Commenting on Friday evening on the stand taken by the prime 
minister, Drzycimski said: "He maintains it because such are the 
coalition agreements; however, if the president has rejected 
this nomination, they just do not have another possibility. 
They must look for a new candidate." 
  In line with Kwasniewski's words, Dariusz Rosati is at the 
coalition's disposal, and he will not make any hasty decision. 
However, in a statement for the television show "Panorama," the 
deputy prime minister candidate admitted that he would still 
like to talk with the prime minister and the SLD leader and that 
he did not rule out the possibility of withdrawing his 
candidacy. As he left the Office of the Council of Ministers, 
Aleksander Kwasniewski went to the airport, from where he left 
for Budapest--with a delay caused by current events. 
  "The prolonging of the absence of the person at the post of 
coordinator of the economy is a bad sign for it," evaluates 
Polish Peasant Party [PSL] Deputy Janusz Piechocinski, "because 
many important laws and decisions are waiting to be dealt with." 
<H5>  The Recall of Modzelewski </H5>
  The prime minister informed the president that he had 
dismissed Witold Modzelewski, secretary of state in the Finance 
Ministry (who has been in the post since Marek Borowski ran the 
ministry), and appointed PSL Deputy Jan Kubik secretary of 
state. He is a deputy for the first time. He works in the 
Budget Committee and is the director of the Tax Office in 
Krakow. According to SLD deputies, this change was not 
consulted with the SLD. Kubik himself did not know about the 
nomination. 
  Witold Modzelewski told us that the prime minister had 
suggested that he return to the post of under secretary of state 
(to which he was promoted by Jan Olszewski) and explained that 
the change was caused by the fact that, in line with coalition 
agreements, the PSL should have its own man in the ministry 
leadership. Modzelewski added that he had not received a 
written recall and that he had not yet decided whether he would 
accept the offer and stay in the ministry. 
  Aleksander Kwasniewski did not want to comment on this 
decision on Friday. He said that making changes in the Finance 
Ministry when the deputy prime minister and the ministry's head 
is not there was not a very good action. He merely admitted 
that, in line with the principle of joint responsibility, 
whenever the minister comes from one coalition party, the other 
grouping should have its own representative in the ministry's 
leadership. 
  According to Marek Borowski, the prime minister's decision 
is 
contrary to the coalition agreement. Both PSL and SLD deputies 
evaluate that personnel changes in the Finance Ministry that are 
not consulted with the SLD will force the SLD to react to them 
and will cause friction within the coalition. 
  In the evening, the prime minister presented Modzelewski 
with 
the nomination act to the post of under secretary of state in 
the Finance Ministry. 
<H5>  Budget Still Open? </H5>
  Asked whether in the present situation we should expect the 
president to approve the state budget, Drzycimski replied: It is 
still open. However, by doing what he did in the Rosati case, 
the president gave a certain signal. 
  "There are no reasons that the budget should not be signed," 
claims Kwasniewski. "There exists something that must be called 
responsibility for the state, a desire to stabilize the 
situation in the country. Now, we should really expect such 
behavior from the president. I am not saying this to cause a 
dispute with the president but to appeal to him for 
consideration." [passage omitted] 
<H5>  The Last Accent </H5>
  Late in the evening, after the Sejm session was completed, 
the SLD Club convened at a meeting that was closed to the press. 
The deputies maintained their support for Rosati's candidacy, 
expressed approval for the firm stance taken by the prime 
minister, and stated that the activity of the president would 
have a destabilizing effect on the state. According to them, 
the crisis that has arisen, which is not an internal crisis of 
the coalition, and the stand taken by Lech Walesa compel them to 
reconsider the SLD's behavior toward Lech Walesa. 
  "This forces us to take a closer look at the president's 
activities and at his powers provided by the Small 
Constitution," said Zbigniew Siemiatkowski. Thus, the deputies 
entirely backed the stand taken earlier by Marek Borowski. The 
club's members decided that it was necessary to hold an SLD 
session very soon in order to discuss the new strategy of the 
grouping. The leftist politicians unofficially mentioned the 
constitutional possibility concerning the president's 
responsibility for activities aimed at destabilizing the state.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy by Ryszard Rybus; </F>
place and date not given: "Jozef Oleksy for RZECZPOSPOLITA; I Do 
Not Think the Prime Minister Does That"] 
  [Text] [Rybus] Do you agree with the suggestion made by 
Marek Borowski, deputy chairman of the Club of the Democratic 
Left Alliance [SLD] concerning the possibilities of limiting the 
presidential powers by the parliament? 
  [Oleksy] This is a statement by one of the SLD activists, 
which is neither the stand of the club nor the stand taken by 
the party. This is a complex statement in the background of 
recent events. Now these events are very bad. The fact that 
the president refused to sign the candidacy of Professor Rosati, 
even though the coalition was fully convinced about the values 
of this candidacy, must be politically significant. 
  [Rybus] In the commentary of the Saturday [26 March] issue 
of TRYBUNA appeared such expressions as "political vengeance" 
and "panic" of a president that is losing power. Are these 
acute expressions the foretaste of a confrontation with the 
Belweder? 
  [Oleksy] I do not know. You are asking me about a 
confrontation of the left with the president. However, it was 
the president who made this decision. 
  [Rybus] Commentators who evaluate the issue of Rosati's 
nomination point at the possibility of Prime Minister Pawlak's 
participation in this game. 
  [Oleksy] I do not suspect the prime minister of making any 
secret moves like that, because, as I understand, this is what 
you mean. The prime minister did delay forwarding the motion, 
which surprised the SLD; however, a serious decision was being 
made, and it is difficult to quarrel over days and hours. The 
fact is that the prime minister submitted the motion, which the 
president refused to sign. He took advantage of his 
constitutional powers. Now the analysis of the case can only be 
political. One has to ask the following question: What purpose 
does such a decision by the president serve? I am afraid that 
it does not serve the purpose of putting our economic life in 
order. Nor does it serve the signals that go from us abroad, 
where Prof. Rosati is a well-known individual. 
  [Rybus] The points in the Rosati game will probably not be 
scored by the SLD. Now the question remains who will gain more: 
the Belweder or Prime Minister Pawlak? 
  [Oleksy] These are speculations that the Sejm speaker should 
not really make.... 
  [Rybus] How about the deputy chairman of the Social 
Democracy of the Polish Republic? 
  [Oleksy] The issue is not about who has gained and who has 
lost. If such a count were to be kept, this would have to mean 
another phase in the lack of agreement between the activities of 
the state's highest organs in issues important to the state. 
And I deplore this. 
  [Rybus] Can the events of the recent days begin the process 
of disintegration of the coalition? 
  [Oleksy] I do not think so, and I would oppose it. 
  [Rybus] How will this dispute end, now that the president 
has declared, through his spokesman, that a change in this 
decision is out of the question? 
  [Oleksy] The end is unclear. I am not able to imagine it at 
the moment because I am afraid that there may appear elements of 
emotion and prestige that will obscure the heart of the matter. 
I would not like this to happen. I believe that appropriate 
coalition bodies, as well as organs of the individual coalition 
members, will convene and make a political evaluation of the 
situation.

  [Text] Prague, March 28 (CTK) -- Although the government 
coalition has agreed on the mechanism for senatorial elections, 
the opposition continues to oppose the filling of the Senate, 
the upper house in the Czech Parliament which is defined in the 
Constitution but has not yet been filled. 
  The coalition parties -- the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), 
the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), the Christian Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), and the Christian 
Democratic Party (KDS) -- adopted a compromise proposal on 
Friday [25 March], according to which in this year's election 27 
large constituencies will each elect three senators. Each 
electoral district will be composed of three smaller ones, so 
that the total number of districts in the Czech Republic will be 
81. 
  Representatives of the deputies' group of the Left Bloc 
(LB), 
the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), and the Czech 
Social Democratic Party (CSSD) today told CTK they opposed the 
decision. 
  LB deputies' group chairman Jaroslav Ortman said the 
proposal 
was politically aimed and legally problematic, as it was not 
defined in the Constitution. He said the proposal testified 
that the coalition parties are pressing for the establishment of 
the Senate primarily to safeguard their power, adding that 
controversies between the coalition parties were ensuing from 
mutual fear. 
  The LB still holds the view that the provision providing for 
the establishment of the Senate should be struck from the 
Constitution, Ortman said. He said that the opinions of the 
president and the Constitutional Court were a sufficient 
safeguard against parliamentary decisions. 
  The KSCM still considers Senate elections an attempt on the 
part of the right to preserve at least part of its power in case 
the distribution of forces between the right and left changes 
after Chamber of Deputies (lower house) elections, KSCM 
spokeswoman Vera Zezulkova told CTK. She said the KSCM rejected 
the Senate, but should a senatorial election be held it 
considered it more democratic to define the length of senators' 
terms of office through the election but not through casting of 
lots. The Communists consider the majority electoral system to 
be discrimination against opposition parties, she added. 
  CSSD Chairman Milos Zeman considers the discussion on 
different variants for senatorial elections "unrealistic," since 
the parliament has not yet decided whether or not it would 
exist. Zeman told CTK that the Social Democrats had submitted a 
bill on the abolition of the Senate to parliament and they 
intended to discuss the coalition's proposal only if their bill 
is rejected.

  [Text] Prague, March 29 (CTK) -- The Civic Democratic 
Party (ODS) will continue to push for Senate elections in 81 
one-mandate constituencies, ODS spokeswoman Jana Petrova told 
journalists after today's meeting of the ODS leadership. 
  That means that the ODS (66 deputies in the 200-seat 
parliament) will insist on its stand although some ODS deputies 
spoke with their coalition colleagues about a possible 
compromise on Friday [25 March]. The ODS has favored that this 
year it would be determined what senators would be elected for 
two, four or six years. 
  The coalition is divided over the issue, as the minor 
parties, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA, 14 deputies), the 
Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL, 
15) and the Christian Democratic Party (KDS, 10) prefer a 
different system consisting of 27 three-mandate constituencies. 
  The opposition is against having a Senate at all and is 
calling for its abolition. 
  "This is the only way to apply the electoral system 
stipulated by the Czech Constitution," Petrova stressed. 
  During Monday's coalition talks Premier and ODS Chairman 
Vaclav Klaus told his partners that his party had not been fully 
informed on the steps of some of its deputies regarding the 
compromise. Today the ODS leadership appointed Klaus to deal 
with the coalition partners on the issue.

  [Text] Prague, March 27 (CTK) -- The right to demonstrate 
cannot be taken away from the unions, Czech President Vaclav 
Havel said today on Czech Radio in his regular Sunday talk from 
Lany. 
  Demonstrations are a traditional tool not only of the 
unions, 
he said, adding that "demonstrations belong to democracy and 
democratic political culture as one of the ways people express 
themselves." Havel said this was why he would not see the 
union-organized Old Town Square demonstration last Tuesday [22 
March] as problematic. 
  In the event, union members, who came to Prague from all 
over 
the Czech Republic in 400 buses, and filled most of the square, 
protested against the employment bill which they saw as leading 
to worsening working and social conditions. The bill was passed 
by parliament last Wednesday [23 March]. 
  "On the other hand, I became aware of still how much our 
unions have to learn to demonstrate in a cultured way," Havel 
said, adding that throwing a stone or saying that the Minister 
(of Employment and Social Affairs Jindrich Vodicka, who was 
prevented by the crowd from addressing the rally) should not 
have come, were "not good signs." "This proves we all have to 
learn political culture," Havel said.

  [Text] Prague, March 28 (CTK) -- The State Attorney's 
Office for Prague's 2nd district has just received President 
Vaclav Havel's letter of March 17 ordering criminal proceedings 
against Petr Cibulka, publisher of the NECENZUROVANE NOVINY 
[UNCENSORED NEWS] periodical accused of defamation of the 
president of the republic, to be dropped. 
  Slavomir Novak from Prague's City State Attorney's Office 
told CTK that the Office had already completed the charge which 
would have probably been brought against Cibulka today or 
tomorrow. 
  Cibulka was accused of defamation for calling Havel "you 
swine, you bastard," during a court case last December. The 
case had been brought against Havel by Cibulka and co-editor of 
NECENZUROVANE NOVINY for the criticisms Havel had made of the 
anti-communist newspaper's decision to publish -- in May 1992 -- 
a list of alleged collaborators with the StB, the former 
communist secret police. 
  The defamation case was to have been resumed in April. After 
the lawsuit was considered in December, Cibulka officially 
queried the impartiality of the judge, and the case was not able 
to proceed until the Supreme Court delivered judgment.

  [Excerpts] Brno, South Moravia, March 28 (CTK) -- Petr 
Cibulka, publisher of the NECENZUROVANE NOVINY [UNCENSORED 
NEWS], insists on being tried. He said this immediately after 
he learnt that Czech President had ordered the cessation of 
criminal proceedings for defamation of the president of the 
republic. [passage omitted] 
  "I fundamentally disagree with the cessation of criminal 
proceedings for the opinion expressed in evaluation of Vaclav 
Havel's political activities after November 17, 1989 (the day 
when the anti-communist "velvet" revolution began in 
Czechoslovakia)," Cibulka told CTK. 
  "Unlike communist criminals, StB [communist-era secret 
police] officers, judges, prosecutors, prison guards, and 
exponents of communist nomenclatura, who still remain unpunished 
and rule firmly over us, there is nothing I could be blamed 
for," Cibulka stressed. 
  He added he wanted to use the trial to "accuse the 
communist-velvet oligarchy, headed by Vaclav Havel, of covering 
numerous crimes," noting that "those covering criminals are 
criminals themselves."

  [Text] Prague/Bratislava, March 25 (CTK) -- The results 
following from a meeting of the Czech and Slovak finance 
ministers, Ivan Kocarnik and Rudolf Filkus, indicate that the so 
called old bloc clearing account could be abolished as of May 1 
or June 1. 
  Ludmila Nutilova, spokeswoman of the Czech Finance Ministry, 
told CTK today that the definitive date of the abolition would 
depend on the Czech and Slovak parliaments. Kocarnik intends to 
propose an amendment to the Czech-Slovak payment agreement to 
the Czech Government by April 10, she said. 
  The negotiations held in Smolenice near Bratislava are also 
attended by the banking boards of both the Czech and Slovak 
National Banks. The talks center on the abolition of the old 
bloc used for Czech-Slovak trade payments for deals concluded 
before February 8, 1993, when the Czech and Slovak currencies 
split, Martin Svehla, a spokesman of the Czech National Bank, 
told CTK. 
  Nutilova explained that the "old" obligations so far cleared 
through the old bloc, would be settled in ECU, in line with the 
new bloc. 
  Svehla said that the old bloc has been misused for 
speculations leading to the deepening of the deficit in 
Slovakia's payments. Filkus recently confirmed that Slovakia 
wanted the old bloc to be abolished by May 1. Svehla did not 
specify the way of abolishing the old bloc. 
  He also confirmed that some Czech-Slovak questions yet to be 
settled, such as the division of the balance of the former 
Czechoslovak State Bank, including Slovakia's gold, were also to 
be discussed at the meeting.

<F P=106> [Article by Keith Damsell: "A Bank Like Any Other?"] </F>
  [Text] When Jacques de Larosiere, the new president of the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD], arrives 
in Prague later this month to address the European Banking 
Forum, he can expect both catcalls and courting. 
  On the eve of its third anniversary, the EBRD, which was 
founded to help rebuild Eastern and Central European economies 
after the fall of communism, continues to be a source of 
controversy in the Czech financial community. 
  In the wake of a recent flurry of EBRD investment in this 
country, many bankers are hoping they can gain backing. The 
forum, to be held March 21-23, should allow them to do some 
networking for loans. 
  But behind the scenes, other bankers and economists question 
the value of the EBRD's activities here. 
  "The EBRD is completely useless," said Vladimir Benacek, an 
associate professor at the Center for Economic Research and 
Graduate Education. 
  Since 1991, the EBRD has poured 384.3 million ECU ($430.4 
million, or about 12 billion Kc) of loan guarantees and direct 
investment into the Czech Republic, the fifth highest total out 
of the 25 countries funded by the bank. But much of that money 
has been earmarked for big-ticket projects that would be 
attractive to any multinational bank, involving such business 
partners as Nestle and Air France. 
  "Why was it created? These are very safe deals--no risk and 
high profit," Benacek said, implying that the EBRD is acting 
like any other big bank rather than living up to its mandate to 
help build a market economy. 
  The EBRD has also drawn fire from other members of the 
banking community. 
  "There's too much bureaucracy, their demands for 
documentation are too high, and they move much too slowly," said 
Pavel Strnad of Vienna-based Raiffeisenbank. 
  The EBRD is reluctant to answer its critics. A bank official 
who agreed to an interview only when guaranteed anonymity 
defended the EBRD's investment policies. 
  "A complaint we've had is we seem to be only interested in 
joint ventures and that we don't seem to be interested in Czech 
companies," the official said. But he blamed the level of loans 
on the companies themselves, saying they often fail to present 
detailed business proposals, the key to securing financing. 
  "Many Czech companies can't give us what we need," he said. 
"They should be better prepared." With parliament's enactment of 
new auditing laws last year, he added, business plans are slowly 
improving. 
  As to complaints of bureaucracy and slow decision making, 
the 
bank official said that "it can slow things down" when the input 
of 50 governments is needed. In addition, each potential project 
must undergo a rigorous and often lengthy environmental 
assessment before winning EBRD approval. 
  The EBRD was founded in 1991 when 39 countries and 15 other 
founding members forked over $5.5 billion to create a financial 
promoter of free-market economics and democracy. 
  The London-based bank's first year, however, was plagued 
with 
scandal. In 1992, the EBRD disbursed only $146 million in loans 
and investments, roughly half what it spent on operating costs. 
In what became known as "Marblegate," the bank spent $1.1 
million to replace the travertine marble in its opulent 
headquarters with Carrara marble. 
  "They invested much more in their marble than in Eastern 
Europe," Benacek said. 
  Former EBRD President Jacques Attali, who resigned last 
June, 
was the target of much of the criticism. Since taking over in 
November, de Larosiere has reorganized the bank and stepped up 
the level of funding. Indeed, 75 percent of the total EBRD money 
allocated to the Czech Republic--288.2 million ECU ($322.8 
million)--was guaranteed in the last five months. 
  That leap in investment has fueled optimism in several Czech 
banks. 
  Jaroslav Kroh, general manager of international banking at 
Komercni banka, is busy courting EBRD officials about several 
proposals. As chairman of the Clearing Bank Association, an 
Eastern and Central European organization, Kroh is lobbying the 
EBRD to act as a "corrector," extending risk limits for 
association members. 
  In addition, the EBRD may be interested in Komercni itself. 
  To build its capital base, Komercni will issue 2 billion Kc 
($66 million) worth of shares by the end of April. An EBRD 
source said his bank is waiting for final approval from the head 
office to buy stock. 
  "I believe it is a good sign," said Kroh. "Of course, there 
is a small danger. Someone can say if the EBRD has given 
[Komercni] an equity injection, it can't be so good." 
  Meanwhile, officials at Investicni a postovni banka are 
hoping the EBRD can extend their export financing credit line 
and help fund a waste-disposal center in Oslavany, near Brno. 
  Pavel Linhart, senior director of foreign exchange and 
project financing at Investicni a postovni, said both projects 
fall well within the mandate of the EBRD. 
  Miroslav Klima, Investicni a postovni's head of export 
financing, said that he had met the EBRD's leading local 
representative but added that "one man cannot cover all the 
projects under way." 
  Nevertheless, the recent increase in funding levels has led 
to "some modest signs of optimism" in the local banking 
community, said Ivan Angelis, secretary general of the 
Association of Banks. But, like many others in the industry, 
Angelis said he will wait for results before drawing his 
conclusions. 
  "We shall have to wait and see," he said.

  [Text] Budapest, 29 Mar (MTI) -- "A new, favourable 
process can begin in the Hungarian-Yugoslav relation," Yugoslav 
Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said, in an interview 
carried in the Tuesday issue of NEPSZABADSAG. Jovanovic gave 
the interview when he made a brief stop in Budapest during his 
travels. 
  In answer to a question, he said the peace and security of 
the Balkan peninsula should be created, but not to the detriment 
of the Serbs. 
  When asked whether the democratization process of Serbia, 
which the international community expects from the settlement of 
the South Slav crisis, has begun or not, Jovanovic said: 
  "The process of democratization is well advanced in 
Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia, that is Serbia, is the only country in 
Eastern Europe which has held three parliamentary elections. If 
the declaration of the people's wish is the chief standard of a 
society's democratic character, then in our case there are no 
grounds for such verdicts, whereby the democratization of 
Yugoslavia is insufficient." 
  As regards his evaluation of Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza 
Jeszenszky's recent visit to Belgrade, Jovanovic said: "It is a 
particularly welcome fact that Jeszenszky's Belgrade visit was 
held in the spirit of mutual confidence. We believe that this 
implies the beginning of a process, which will result in the 
intensification of mutual confidence, political relations and 
the various cooperation forms."

  [Text] Budapest, March 27 (MTI) -- Hungarian Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszenszky attended a public forum at Sarvar, 
western Hungary, on Sunday [27 March]. The minister expressed 
his trust in Russia's foreign policy, and said that peace 
partnership would provide a good framework for reducing 
anti-Western prejudice in Russians. In his view, Russia's more 
active foreign policy poses no danger to the region. If this 
policy aims to restore peace in the Balkans, it is welcomed by 
all, Jeszenszky said. 
  The minister mentioned that Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin would visit Budapest next week. 
  Russian Patriarch Aleksey II, who visited Hungary recently, 
could also experience that both the Hungarian people and 
policy-makers are eager to strengthen economic relations with 
Russia, Jeszenszky said. 
  Concerning the new Slovak government, the minister said that 
Hungary is ready to pursue a policy of extended arms. Should 
someone grasp this arm, it would be fortunate not only for the 
two countries but even for Europe as a whole, he said.

  [Text] Budapest, 25 March (MTI) -- Hungary welcomes the 
draft European Stability Agreement being outlined on the basis 
of the Balladur plan, the foreign affairs executive of the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), Gyorgy Csoti, said at his 
press conference in Budapest on Friday [25 March]. The first 
conference on the agreement is expected to be held in May, based 
on the preparatory work. 
  Csoti said a condition for the successful conference is that 
representatives of the Hungarian national minorities living in 
the different countries be present at the talks. The politician 
said no decision can be reached about the minorities without 
them. 
  Csoti noted with regret that, contrary to the expectations, 
no positive changes have come about in Romania and the related 
recommendations of the Council of Europe were not fulfilled. 
  He said it is distressing that no commemorations were heard 
in Romanian legislature in Hungarian to mark March 15, the 
Hungarian national day, the anniversary of the outbreak of the 
1848-49 revolution and freedom fight. Csoti said the senior 
political forces in Bucharest rely on extreme nationalist, 
chauvinistic parties.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 27 -- President Lech Walesa is not 
afraid of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) submitting a motion 
to the Sejm to restrict his constitutional powers. "They can 
accelerate elections and in elections the winner will be obvious 
anyway," Walesa told journalists Sunday before his departure 
from Gdansk to Warsaw. 
  Walesa confirmed that the rejection of the candidature of 
Dariusz Rosati for the post of finance minister and deputy prime 
minister is final and the decision will not be changed even 
after a potential meeting on the matter with Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak takes place. 
  "FOZZ (the Foreign Debt Servicing Fund) case was a great 
theft and there were people responsible for FOZZ and this 
candidate was one of the responsible. I am not saying whether 
he was guilty or not but he was on the spot where the crime was 
committed," said the president. 
  "Rosati was absent from the country for three years and 
therefore it is difficult to determine whether he has the 
knowledge of things and reality in the country," added Walesa. 
  Asked whether Leslaw Paga, the chairman of the Securities 
Commission, would be a good candidate for the post of deputy 
prime minister and finance minister, the president said, "I know 
this candidature and I would really have nothing against but it 
is not me who proposes candidates." 
  The president expressed his indignation at a statement by 
leader of the SLD parliamentary floor group Aleksander 
Kwasniewski -- related to him by one of journalists -- who, 
during a break in the Sunday meeting of the main council of the 
Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SDRP), allegedly 
said, commenting on the conflict with the Belvedere on Rosati's 
nomination, "Enough of this circus." 
  Walesa said, "We have had enough of the circus with 
Kwasniewski and the like for 50 years and this circus will 
really not be put on. Mr Kwasniewski will not be putting it on, 
he may be sure of that. I will not allow him to do that." 
  "There was a circus even with the constitution, with my 
initiative, which was rejected and now it has been approved. So 
that is the circus presented by Mr Kwasniewski and company," 
added the president. 
  (When one of journalists suggested during the break in the 
SDRP meeting that maybe the prime minister is not sure whether 
he wants to cooperate with Rosati either, Kwasniewski said, "I 
realize we live in the country where every question might be 
asked, even the most crazy one. If the prime minister is not 
sure and signs the motion (to nominate Rosati as finance 
minister), how do you imagine that ... maybe it is not Rosati 
but Keynes that is at stake (John Maynard Keynes British 
Economist 1883-1946). There are limits to the circus in which 
we may participate. You, as journalists, I, as a politician, Mr 
President, the prime minister, candidates ... I think that 
there is more circus and playing the state than the true state 
in this whole affair.") 
  Lech Walesa did not confirm whether he will sign the 1994 
budget law. "I am still collecting opinions, for the time being 
I have serious doubts but it is not determined yet what my 
decision will be like." According to the president, the decision 
might be reached during the coming week. 
  Asked to comment on the corruption affair in the police, 
Walesa said, "There is a great reconstruction in Poland, one has 
to blame it (corruption) on reform and on big transformations. 
It has to be fought with and I will be doing that."

  [Text] Budapest, 28 Mar (MTI) -- Hungarian President Arpad 
Goncz and Polish President Lech Walesa talked in Warsaw on 
Monday. Both presidents felt that Hungarian-Polish friendship 
could stabilise the Visegrad pact (Hungary, Poland, the Czech 
Republic, and Slovakia), and European integration efforts. 
  On Monday at his residence, President Goncz received the 
representatives of Podkowa Lesna town, near Warsaw, which was 
one of the main centres of Polish opposition in the 1980s. 
Parish priest Leon Kantorski figured prominently in this, and 
the Hungarian president presented him with the Imre Nagy 
Memorial Plaque. President Goncz presented the Pro Cultura 
Hungaria Memorial Medal to the Chairman of the Federation of 
Polish-Hungarian Friendship Societies. In the afternoon, the 
Hungarian president received Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski. 
  President Goncz also paid a visit to the Polish Parliament. 
He met leaders of the parliamentary clubs, the chairman of the 
foreign affairs and economic committees of both Houses, and 
members of the Polish-Hungarian group of the Interparliamentary 
Union. He said Hungary sees closer cooperation with countries in 
the region as vital, with Poland as its closest partner in the 
region. The president also valued the Visegrad group, and 
thought that the earliest possible introduction of the Central 
European free trade bloc is a basic condition of a trade boom. 
The Hungarian president then met Jozef Oleksy, marshall of the 
Sejm, and with Zofia Kuratowska, deputy marshall of the Senate.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 29 -- Hungarian President Arpad Goncz 
said Tuesday that Poland and Hungary have agreed on all vital 
issues, summing up his talks with President Lech Walesa, Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak and other Polish officials during his 
short official visit to Poland. 
  Goncz, holding a press conference, said Poland and Hungary 
are linked by the common goal of quick integration with Western 
Europe, through European Union membership as well as through 
cooperation in other fields of international political life. 
  He stressed the importance of regional cooperation, 
including 
cooperation within the Visegrad group. "There should be a 
multicolour Europe of regions, while our integration with 
European structures would serve Europe as a whole as well as our 
region," said Goncz. 
  "We have not discussed military cooperation during this 
visit," the president said adding, however, that there are wide 
possibilities of cooperation between Polish and Hungarian arms 
industries. He said he discussed with Polish partners such 
cooperation and the difficult financial situation of those 
industries in both countries. 
  Arpad Goncz assured the Polish hosts that there will be no 
return to the old system after May elections in Hungary 
"irrespective who wins the elections... Hungary's foreign 
policy, approach towards the economy and Polish-Hungarian 
relations will remain unchanged." He added that "for Hungary, 
Poland, ruled by the left, elected in democratic elections, 
remains to be the same partner as it had been before."

  [Text] Warsaw, March 25 -- The Council of the Coordinating 
Committee for East-West-Trade Policy (COCOM) has lifted export 
restrictions imposed on Poland. The decision was made in 
connection with the coming into force of the law on the 
principles of special control over foreign trade in commodities 
and know-how on Friday, the Foreign Ministry said today. 
  Long-term efforts by Polish diplomacy to get free access to 
advanced Western know-how scored success. This decision should 
result in further improvement in Poland's economic cooperation 
with states having the latest know-how, the Foreign Ministry's 
Press and Information Department said. 
  According to the Ministry, the COCOM decision is also of 
political significance, showing recognition for Poland's active 
and responsible policy in the non-proliferation of mass 
destruction weapons and facilitating Poland's integration 
strivings.

  [Text] Gdansk, March 28 -- Leader of the Confederation for 
an Independent Poland (KPN) Leszek Moczulski said that "the 
ruling coalition is bound to collapse soon, after the local 
government elections." 
  Speaking to journalists in Gdansk on Monday Moczulski added 
that "the coalition is actually in pieces today." In his opinion 
"the conflict between the president and the Democratic Left 
Alliance (SLD) is actually a conflict between Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak and SLD Leader Aleksander Kwasniewski which has 
its roots in the case of former Deputy Prime Minister and 
Finance Minister Marek Borowski. [no closing quotation marks as 
received] 
  The KPN leader sees the weakness of the SLD in the 
alliance's 
lack of additional candidates for ministerial posts. This was 
the cause of putting forward Dariusz Rosati, connected to the 
notorious affair of the Foreign Debt Servicing Funds (FOZZ), to 
replace Marek Borowski after his resignation as deputy prime 
minister and finance minister. 
  Moczulski forecasts "a great social commotion to take place 
within either a few or several months" which would bring about 
the collapse of the ruling coalition, vain attempts to form new 
government and early parliamentary elections.

  [Text] Krakow, March 26 -- Leader of the Movement of the 
Third Republic of Poland (RTR) Jan Parys told the national 
conference of the centre-right in Krakow on Saturday that the 
meeting came as a reply to the appeal by Solidarity leader 
Marian Krzaklewski for political parties to present an economic 
programme for Poland. 
  "Our alliance with Solidarity is a fact, and there are no 
conflicts between us on the economy," said Parys explaining that 
both Solidarity and the centre-right wanted a sound economy, 
honest privatisation and protection for the Polish consumer. 
  The conference met under the slogan "The Economy and 
Society." 
  The "Secretariat of Centre-right Groupings" (SUC) was formed 
on October 14 last year. It includes the Centre Alliance (PC), 
the Polish Peasant Party Peasant Agreement (PSL-PL) the Movement

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES 24/3/1994 -- Both countries' wish 
to develop the traditional Romanian-Turkish relations was 
highlighted during the formal interview in Bucharest on 24 March 
between President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey and Romanian Prime 
Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. 
  During the first minutes of the interview, when the press 
was 
allowed to attend, Premier Vacaroiu referred to the constant 
support Turkey has given Romania in this difficult period. He 
said the bilateral trade topped last year the 400 million dollar 
mark, which however did not reflect the two countries' real 
potential. The same was said by the Turkish president, who 
showed the trade ought to reach one billion dollars. 
  President Demirel also assessed that Romania and Turkey 
could 
help develop a multilateral cooperation in the Black Sea area 
and achieving stability in the Balkans. He also referred to the 
need to intensify the links between the two countries' 
businessmen, and their collaboration in third markets. 
  "It is up to us to open the way," he added.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES 24/3/1994 -- The Romanian and 
Turkish foreign ministers, Teodor Melescanu and Hikmet Cetin had 
a round of talks in Bucharest, on 24 March. They focussed on 
international issues, Balkan ones in particular, with special 
stress on the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, said the Turkish 
guest at the close of the talks. The Turkish foreign minister 
enlarged on the appeal launched by President Suleyman Demirel 
today before Romania's Parliament, an appeal addressed to 
Bosnian Serbs to find a way to adhere to a confederation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Also, the stage of the relations between the two countries 
and their neighbours was surveyed, in Romania's case with 
Hungary and Ukraine, and in Turkey's case with Greece and the 
states in the Caucasian ex-Soviet region, as well as the two 
countries' relations with the European Union from the angle of 
the Union's extension with new members. 
  Turkey's unconditional support was reiterated to Romania in 
the process of integration in the NATO, the Romanian Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Mircea Geoana said at the end of the round of 
talks.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 28/3/1994 -- In an interview with 
a press correspondent of the Macedonian news agency of 
THESSALONIKI, President Ion Iliescu of Romania said his visit to 
Greece over 30-31 March "has a special political significance, 
both for the bilateral relations and for the general development 
in the Balkans." 
  "The Romanian-Greek relations, which I can term as 
excellent," the president of Romania said, "are based on long 
and solid traditions. Along history many have been the 
circumstances in which our countries helped each other in 
friendship and solidarity. Maybe the inter-war period was the 
most flourishing, when Romania and Greece were the promoters of 
development and cooperation in the Balkans. 
  "After the 1989 revolution in Romania, the relations between 
Romania and Greece have followed an ascending curve in all 
spheres, building an atmosphere of mutual confidence which we 
intend to capitalise during this visit. We shall avail 
ourselves of this opportunity not only to enhance the relations 
of friendship and cooperation between our countries, but also to 
find new practical ways of developing the political 
consultations, economic collaboration, cultural and human 
contacts between our peoples. We have always appreciated the 
assistance Greece has rendered to us, the attachment to our 
demarches for integration in the European Union and for gaining 
full membership to the Council of Europe. The Greek Parliament 
was the first to ratify the treaty for Romania's association 
with the European Union. It was also Greece that upheld the 
idea of non-differential treatment by NATO of the countries in 
the Centre and East of Europe and we believe that Greece can 
have a new and important contribution in all the phases of 
Romania's integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures. 
  "At the talks we are going to have in Athens we shall 
doubtlessly approach the aspects concerning the complex 
situation in our region. By dialogue and exchange of ideas we 
hope to bring our contribution to finding the best solutions apt 
to strengthen stability and peace in this part of Europe," 
President Ion Iliescu said.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 29/3/1994 -- "The ruling Party 
of Social Democracy does not wish early elections," said the 
PDSR Executive President Adrian Nastase, in an interview with 
the governmental daily VOCEA ROMANIEI. Early elections at the 
time being "would hinder Romania's political and economic 
functioning," opined Adrian Nastase. 
  The PSDR leader said also that the PSDR could reasonably 
consider the opportunity of local elections as much as certain 
political forces were asking for general elections. By the time 
of the local elections of February 1992, the PSDR had not been 
formed yet, reminded Adrian Nastase. As the local authorities 
are the ones to administer the general elections, the ruling 
party would have no degree of involvement in the territory in 
case of early parliamentary elections, said Nastase. The PSDR 
would therefore assign a higher priority to early local 
elections, ahead of general elections. 
  The PSDR leader reminded also that the recent polls 
confirmed 
that the PSDR had maintained its popularity with the electorate 
as revealed by the past parliamentary elections of September 
1992, some 28 percent.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 26 (CTK) -- Preparations for early 
elections in autumn will be high on the agenda of a two-day 
national congress of the opposition Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS) which opened in Presov, east Slovakia, today. 
Delegates will assess the period of the HZDS government, elect a 
new leadership and approve a new election manifesto and statutes. 
  According to the latest public opinion poll conducted 
immediately after the March 14 dismissal of Vladimir Meciar from 
the post of Slovak premier and the ousting of his cabinet, 
HZDS's shift to the opposition increased its popularity among 
voters to more than 26 percent (against 22 percent in February). 
Given this trend, the fragmented political scene and the loss 
of interest by a considerable part of the population in 
politics, Meciar's comeback as head of a new government after 
the autumn elections cannot be ruled out. 
  Observers do not rule out that a further split of Meciar's 
movement, which now has 56 deputies, down from a total of 74 
after the June 1992 parliamentary elections, can occur at the 
congress. According to speculations, the postponement of the 
movement's change into a party could result in the withdrawal 
from the movement of social democratic-minded deputies with 
parliamentary foreign committee chairman Ivan Laluha at their 
head. 
  Attending the congress are representatives of the Slovak 
historical cultural institution Matica Slovenska, the 
Confederation of Trade Unions and the Farmers Party. Members of 
the diplomatic corps of the United States, Russia, China and 
other countries are also taking part. Slovak President Michal 
Kovac sent a letter to the congress, but it was not read. At the 
HZDS conference in Presov, east Slovakia, HZDS Deputy Chairwoman 
Olga Keltosova today said that it was unacceptable for the 
movement to be reduced to maintaining a defensive policy before 
the early elections in autumn. She rejected politicking by 
individual HZDS members who want to act in line with their 
"conscience," and said that the HZDS's election policy should be 
unified. 
  The foundation of Milan Knazko's Alliance of Slovak 
Democrats 
and Ludovit Cernak's National Democratic Party-New Alternative 
caused a personal and institutional catharsis in the political 
centre, to which the HZDS belongs, whilst the political spectrum 
on the right and the left has remained stable, Keltosova said. 
The process abetted by various media has strengthened 
"political anti-culture," she added. 
  In a letter sent to the conference, Slovak President Michal 
Kovac described the HZDS as a meaningful political force. "It 
would be no good if I hid the tension between the HZDS chairman 
(Meciar) and the president which had gradually grown into open 
attacks on the Slovak President," said the letter, read at the 
conference. Kovac said this conflict had not been personal, but 
because of its social and political character it had had a 
negative impact on developments in Slovakia. 
  At a brief press conference in a break of the HZDS 
conference, HZDS Deputy Chairman Sergej Kozlik said the movement 
would develop as a pragmatic centre party after the autumn 
elections. The HZDS would seek to cover up a broader spectrum 
of opinions and thus follow the line common in other European 
countries, Kozlik said. Keltosova told journalists after the 
first day of the HZDS conference that the HZDS would develop as 
a political centre party and rejected the idea of the HZDS being 
a "pragmatic centre party." She said that the HZDS was not 
likely to change into a party at the current two-day conference 
and added that in future the HZDS would maintain a clear 
political profile. She described as the most acceptable option 
the movement's entry into the liberal international. 
  Keltosova confirmed that ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar's shadow 
cabinet would meet regularly once a week. She said former HZDS 
ministers would participate in the work of the cabinet and that 
the vacancies would be gradually filled.

  [Text] Presov, east Slovakia, March 27 (CTK) -- Vladimir 
Meciar, who was today reelected chairman of the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), said the HZDS would remain a 
movement until early elections in autumn. A two-day HZDS 
conference, which opened here yesterday, elected today Olga 
Keltosova HZDS deputy chairwoman in charge of social welfare 
area and Sergej Kozlik HZDS deputy chairman in charge of the 
economy. Ivan Lexa was elected HZDS executive secretary. 
  After the election of the new HZDS leadership, Meciar told 
journalists that about half of the delegates spoke in favour of 
the movement's transformation into a party, while the other half 
was against. He said the HZDS programme described HZDS as a 
future "pragmatic centre party." A lot will also depend on the 
development of other parties, Meciar said. The current 
withdrawal of experts and a part of members from the Democratic 
Left Party (SDL) gave the HZDS a chance to gain influence among 
the Social Democrats, he added. 
  HZDS leading official Ivan Laluha said the issue of HZDS 
orientation had not yet been settled and added that he himself 
favoured social democratic orientation. Referring to Slovak 
President Michal Kovac, Meciar said: "I can only state that 
political culture is not a strong point of the Primacialny 
Palace (the seat of Slovak President)." He said that after a 
letter which Kovac sent to the conference yesterday was read, 
delegates whistled. "There was no one clapping their hands, but 
many were whistling," Meciar said. In the letter, Kovac said he 
did not want to hide the tension between him and Meciar which 
had gradually grown into open attacks on Kovac. In Kovac's 
opinion, it was not a personal but a social and political 
conflict which had a negative impact on the developments in 
Slovakia. Meciar said that the HZDS was coming to the conclusion 
that Kovac and his office would be tripped by what they had done 
to Meciar and his cabinet. "They will slowly come to realise -- 
it is a question of days or hours for them to figure that out -- 
that this is the way it is and that they will have to fight hard 
for themselves," Meciar said. He went on to say that the HZDS 
would not consider legitimiate new leaders of the Supreme 
Inspection Office (NKU), to be elected at a forthcoming 
parliamentary session, and would not acknowledge them as 
constitutional officials. 
  The NKU leadership was dismissed by the new coalition 
government at the latest session of parliament. Meciar said 
this ran counter to the constitution. He stressed the HZDS 
would reject the coalition-announced offer that the HZDS fill 
the post of NKU deputy chairman. Meciar described as shaky the 
position of the present Slovak government of Jozef Moravcik. He 
said the HZDS "was familiar with curricula vitae of the 
government members" and that government discussion on its 
programme could already indicate something. HZDS deputy chairman 
Sergej Kozlik told reporters that the priorities of a new HZDS 
economic programme were pro-export policies, qualified 
protection of the home market, rapid privatisation and revival 
of financial channels and agriculture. He said he had "great" 
reservations about work of the present government in the area of 
home market protection. Kozlik said Moravcik's cabinet had 
launched a frontal retreat from positions which the cabinet of 
Vladimir Meciar "had worked out in considerable detail" with 
relation to the Czech Republic and other countries.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 29 (CTK) -- A quarter of Slovaks 
would vote for the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) of 
former Premier Vladimir Meciar if there were elections now, 
according to a poll conducted by the Focus public opinion 
agency. The poll, carried out in the third week of March, i.e. 
after the no-confidence vote in Meciar, found that twenty-four 
percent of respondents said they would vote HZDS, whereas in 
January the party polled 17 percent. 
  The second most popular party was still the Democratic Left 
Party (SDL), which is in the post-Meciar government coalition, 
but its popularity has slipped from 11 percent in January to 10 
today. The Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) attracted seven 
percent support, the same as in January. 
  The remaining parties all received less than the five 
percent 
that would be required for participation in parliament. The 
newly formed left-wing Association of Slovak Workers (SDS) and 
the Slovak National Party (SNS), coalition partner in the former 
Meciar government, both received four percent, as did the 
right-wing Democratic Party (DS). 
  The new party created by ex-HZDS deputy and former foreign 
minister Milan Knazko, the Alliance of Democrats (AD) was 
favored by three percent of the respondents, as were the Greens 
(SZ) and Egyutteles, the Hungarian minority party. One-time 
economy minister and former SNS chairman Ludovit Cernak's new 
party, the National Democratic Party (NDS), received the support 
of one percent of respondents. 
  The ousted premier was also judged to be the most 
trustworthy 
Slovak politician by 26 percent, four percent more than in 
January. Meciar shares this distinction, however, with the man 
seen at least partly for his downfall, President Michal Kovac 
(26 percent). 
  Third most trusted was current Premier Jozef Moravcik, who 
rose from 4 percent in January to 18 percent in March. Peter 
Weiss, SDL chairman, was backed by 12 percent, while 
Vice-Premier Roman Kovac was most trusted by 6 percent. About 
one fifth of those polled did not trust any Slovak politicians.

  [Text] Zvolen, central Slovakia, March 26 (CTK) -- Ludovit 
Cernak was elected chairman of the newly-established National 
Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS-NA). At an NDS-NA 
constituent congress vote here today, Cernak received 136 votes 
out of a total of 137 cast. Cernak, former chairman of the 
Slovak National Party (SNS), was the only candidate for the 
post. Delegates to the constituent conference of the National 
Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS-NA) decided that the 
party, which declared itself a conservative one, would seek 
admission to the European Democratic Union (EDU). 
  According to preliminary consultations, the Christian 
Democratic Movement (KDH) and some conservative parties of the 
Visegrad group countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland 
and Slovakia), which are EDU members, would support the 
newly-established party in its effort. 
  Cernak said the party intended to cooperate with Czech 
members of the EDU -- the ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS) 
and the government coalition Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA). 
The NDS-NA would run for the forthcoming early elections in a 
coalition with the Alliance of Slovak Democrats (ADSR) of 
ex-Foreign Minister Milan Knazko and the Slovak Democratic Union 
(DUS) of Premier Jozef Moravcik. Negotiations are underway with 
the Greens Party on its participation in the pre-election 
coalition bloc. 
  The party's primary goal is preparation of coupon 
privatisation. Privatisation Minister Milan Janicina said he 
sought to speed up privatisation in such a way that it became 
irreversible. Coupon privatisation is to concern 80 to 100 
billion crowns (2.6 to 3.3 billion USD) worth of property.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 25 (CTK) -- Differing foreign 
orientation and the dilemma of the "selective" membership or a 
wide membership prevents from creating one party composed of 
three groupings represented in Moravcik's cabinet, chairman of 
the preparatory committee of the National Democratic Party-New 
Alternative (NDS-NA) Ludovit Cernak said. The groupings, the 
"Centric Bloc" consists of "dissidents" from former Premier 
Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and 
Slovak National Party (SNS): the Alliance of Slovak Democrats 
(AD SR), led by former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko, the 
Democratic Union of Slovakia (DUS) of current Premier Jozef 
Moravcik and Cernak's NDS-NA. The centrists, who have seven 
posts in Moravcik's eighteen-member cabinet, are holding a 
constituent congress on Saturday [26 March]. "The NDS-NA's place 
will be right of center of the political spectrum; it should 
head towards the European Democratic Union," said Cernak, former 
SNS chairman. The latest poll gives 1.3 percent for Cernak's 
party, while the AD SR would receive 1.2 percent of votes.

  [Text] Zvolen, central Slovakia, March 26 (CTK) -- Slovak 
Deputy Premier Roman Kovac confirmed to CTK today that 
ex-Foreign Minister Milan Knazko's Alliance of Slovak Democrats 
and Premier Jozef Moravcik's Democratic Union were likely to 
merge in the middle of April into a liberal-oriented entity. 
  At a constituent congress of Ludovit Cernak's National 
Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS-NA) in Zvolen, Kovac said 
this unification process was natural as both groupings were of a 
liberal orientation and emerged from the same movement -- now 
the opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) of 
ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar. Kovac said that latest talks 
confirmed the creation of a joint election bloc comprising the 
future liberal party and Cernak's conservative NDS-NA. Kovac did 
not even rule out the possibility of creating a joint party with 
the NDS-NA, but added that the current legislation did not make 
it possible to establish a two-wing party, like for instance the 
French UDF (French Democracy Union). This model is backed by 
Cernak, former chairman of the Slovak National Party (SNS) which 
was a junior partner of the former HZDS-SNS government 
coalition. Kovac said he was convinced the centrist bloc would 
get the necessary seven per cent of the vote in the autumn 
elections to get to the parliament. 
  Chairman of the NDS-NA preparatory committee Cernak said in 
his address to the congress a clear economic policy which will 
lead Slovakia out of the economic crisis, family development, 
non- confrontation ethnic minorities policy and regional 
programme were the NDS-NA's priorities. He said that the new 
entity, which emerged from the SNS, would be based on 
conservative values. The NDS-NA's programme is based on 
national democratic patriotism, a free market, a law-abiding 
state and the principles of Western democratic civilisation. He 
said that "the new alternative for Slovakia was no longer 
Czech-Slovak resentment... nor the extreme nationalism of the 
HZDS ... nor boundless liberalism with its slogan "dog eat dog." 
  In the afternoon the congress will elect new party bodies.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 28 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic 
and Slovakia have reached agreement to mutually recognize food 
quality certificates under the condition that Slovakia amends 
its customs law, one of the participants in today's meeting of 
the Customs Union Council told CTK. He added the amendment 
could have the form of a certificates clause to the Czech-Slovak 
payments agreement. 
  Another condition is the conclusion of an inter-state 
agreement dealing with cases involving certificated foodstuffs 
which would not meet the prescribed quality. A commission of 
experts is to be set up to make out the list of "sensitive 
items" and to define conditions of their exchanges. 
  The above measures do not apply to re-exported goods whose 
import is possible only if accompanied by certificates from the 
importing country. 
  Measures facilitating the implementation of the agreement 
are 
to be worked out by May 1, the date until which Slovakia had for 
the time being postponed the realization of its request for 
obligatory food certification. 
  Slovakia started to require certificates for food imports on 
February 11. One week later, on the request from Prague, it 
suspended the measure temporarily. Later, the former government 
of Vladimir Meciar said it would reintroduce the certificate 
request as from April 1, but the new government of Jozef 
Moravcik, which was appointed on March 16, postponed the measure 
minimally until May 1.

  [Text] Skopje, March 27 (BTA corr. Nikolai Koev) -- On his 
way to Tirana Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov 
stopped in Skopje and had almost two-hour talks with his 
Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
counterpart Stevo Crvenkovski. Mr. Daskalov is due to pay an 
official visit to Tirana. The two foreign ministers met at one 
of the government residences in Skopje and discussed a wide 
range of issues of mutual interest. 
  Foreign Minister Daskalov confirmed Bulgaria's principled 
stand for establishing goodneighbourly relations in the region 
of the Balkans and stressed the particular importance of 
Bulgarian-Macedonian cooperation for the general political 
climate in the region. Mr. Daskalov expressed satisfaction over 
the decision of the Macedonian Government to speed up the 
construction of the Kumanovo-Kriva Palanka-Gyueshevo railway 
line which will make it possible to open a Bulgarian-Macedonian 
railway corridor as part of the large East-West transport 
project. The Bulgarian foreign minister also reiterated 
Bulgaria's stand that the Balkan countries should refrain from 
direct or indirect involvement in the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and should keep their neutrality in the 
interest of a speedier solution of this conflict. 
  Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski stressed his 
country's striving to pursue a constructive Balkan policy and 
the importance of promoting Bulgarian-Macedonian relations. Mr. 
Crvenkovski noted the need to activate bilateral trade and 
economic relations as well as contacts in all spheres of mutual 
interest. 
  The two sides agreed that Bulgaria and Macedonia have real 
possibilities for establishing friendly relations in conformity 
with international norms and standards and to emerge as a 
stabilizing factor in the region of the Balkans.

Freedoms Defence Council in Prishtina protested on March 24 
against the torturing of three former Albanian officers Ismet 
Veliqi, Avdi Behrami, and Azem Gasgi who have been imprisoned in 
Mitrovica. The protest which was signed by the chairman of the 
council, Adem Demaci, pointed out that according to reports, the 
prisoners are subjected to barbarous tortures, such as electric 
batons, chemicals and other means. 
  The Journalists' Association of Kosova protested against the 
60 days imprisonment by the Serbian Court in Prishtina of the 
reporter Shaip Beqiri, who has served sentences by the Serbian 
prisons several times before. According to the association, the 
latest imprisonment is made in the course of punishments and 
persecutions of Albanian reporters and creators in Kosova by 
Serbian authorities.

  [Text] Prishtina, March 26 (ATA) -- Since October 18 of 
the last year, Serbian authorities have taken the passport, 
blocked the phone of Rexhep Qosja, academician and writer, 
practically putting him into home arrest, the ATA reporter in 
Prishtina reports. 
  ATA reporter said that when Serbian authorities banned the 
Albanalogic Institute, they gave a decision to Mr. Qosja 
according to which he must be taken the passport and pay a 3,000 
DM [German marks] fine. This is the biggest punishment for 
passing the border with Albania without exit visas. The 
punishment is applied by Yugoslavia since 1981 in order to stop 
any kind of communication between the Albanians who are 
separated by Albania-Kosova border which is under Serbian forces 
control. 
  The Council for Human Rights Protection in Prishtina, the 
Albanian Intellectuals Forum, and the Albanalogic Institute 
appeal to the international community for stopping the 
repression on Albanians of Kosova and taking the passports from 
them.

  [Text] Sofia, March 28 (BTA) -- Bulgaria woke up this 
morning to empty newsstands and a heavy snowfall. The national 
dailies will suspend publication until March 31 in protest 
against the value added tax [VAT] which is to take effect on 
April 1. Express, Darik Radio, FM Plus, Radio 99, Tangra and 
Vitosha are the four private radios which stopped broadcasting 
at 6 A.M. today. 
  The newspapers, whose editors-in-chief declared the four-day 
boycott, include the dailies of the two major political forces: 
DUMA of the Bulgarian Socialist Party and DEMOKRATSIYA of the 
Union of Democratic Forces; the largest-circulation 24 CHASA 
daily, the private dailies KONTINENT, DENYAT, STANDART NEWS, 
EXPRESS, PARI, NOVINAR, OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK and the daily of one 
of the major trade union amalgamations, TRUD. The 15 newspapers 
and the private radios stopped covering the work of the National 
Assembly and the government last Wednesday [23 March], 
protesting against the failure to include the VAT amendment bill 
in last week's parliamentary agenda. In solidarity, national 
television and radio have also cut down their parliamentary and 
cabinet reports. The Bulgarian News Agency (BTA) and some 
provincial newspapers also back the protesters' demands. 
NARODNA ARMIYA, the daily of the Defence Ministry, was the only 
one to come out today. 
  Unless parliament holds an extraordinary sitting, the 
problem 
cannot be solved before Wednesday [30 March]. The amendments to 
the VAT Act were approved by the parliamentary Economic 
Committee. The parliamentary Finance and Budgetary Committee 
moved a compromise version, and the stand of the Legislative 
Committee is still expected. Aleksandur Dzherov, chairman of 
the Legislative Committee, said in parliament he will not block 
the bill. Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov, however, 
declared himself against the revision, saying the country could 
survive a couple days without newspapers. This televised 
statement prompted the editors-in-chief of the major newspapers 
to demand Mr. Aleksandrov's resignation. 
  The journalists will go to work, they will attend press 
conferences and other public events -- but will not bring their 
tape recorders. 
  The demands pressed by the protesting editors-in-chief were 
backed by a number of Bulgarian intellectuals, the International 
Confederation of Journalists, the Balkan Confederation of 
Journalists and 40 European publishers. 
  According to recent figures, some three million readers are 
following the Bulgarian press. An express poll conducted among 
Sofianites showed that 60 percent of them support the decision 
of the leading Bulgarian dailies. Since early morning, the 
Bulgarian National Radio has been broadcasting listeners' 
comments and opinions on the issue.

  [Text] Prague, March 26 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav 
Havel and the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) Deputy Group 
representatives agreed that the compromise solution of the 
Senate election key worked out by the coalition representatives 
on Friday [25 March] might be a good working proposition for 
drafting the parliament and senate election bill, ODA Deputy 
Group Chairman Oldrich Kuzilek told journalists today after the 
meeting with Havel. 
  Kuzilek said the ODA deputies also told Havel about their 
attitude towards the issue of Jewish property restitution. The 
ODA-proposed amendments to the out-of-court rehabilitation 
settlement and land laws are not seen by the ODA deputies as a 
breach of the 1948 restitution deadline. "All it takes is to be 
well versed in the 1950s statutes," Kuzilek said. The amendment 
only seeks that all which ought to have been restituted under 
the law was restituted, he added. 
  Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) Deputy Group Chairman 
Karel Hrdy said that he told Havel about an amendment to local 
election law. The CSSD pushes for a proportionate and simple 
majority combination election system, he said he told Havel. 
CSSD Deputy Petra Buzkova said they also consulted the question 
of pensionable age with Havel. 
  Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party 
(KDU-CSL) Deputy Group representative and deputy chairman of 
parliament Jan Kasal said that Havel was open to the idea of 
"three times and no more," a short for sentencing to life 
without the possibility of parole habitual offenders on a third 
conviction of a listed violent crime. Havel agreed, adding, 
however, that even such convicts should be allowed the chances 
of re-socialisation under strict conditions still to be worked 
out, Kasal said. 
  Havel also agreed that alternative punishment for light 
crimes, namely community work, become part of the criminal code, 
Kasal said.

  [Text] Prague, March 27 (CTK) -- The somewhat pointed 
exchange on the issue of Senate elections between the Civic 
Democratic Alliance (ODA) and the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), 
the main coalition party, was due to the lack of coalition 
agreement on the matter, Czech Deputy Premier and ODA Chairman 
Jan Kalvoda said on television today. Kalvoda appeared in a 
Nova television station discussion programme "7 or Seven Days." 
  Lack of "coalition communication" is a serious matter, 
Kalvoda said, adding that the fact that several government 
proposals have been turned down by parliament proved his 
argument. 
  "It is possible to ponder over the weight of this or that 
party in the light of election results but we can only wield 
parliamentary majority if we stay together," Kalvoda said, 
adding that a working coalition communication would prevent 
media disclosures of clashes during debates. 
  Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec (ODS) said in the programme 
that often what happens in cases like that is that "small 
coalition parties try to assert themselves even at the cost of 
breaking the coalition." Zieleniec said that he considered it 
important to "lead public discussion." 
  The government-proposed Senate elections bill has not been 
drafted by the ODS but by the Interior Ministry, Zieleniec said. 
  A week ago, ODA deputy chairman Daniel Kroupa said in an 
interview with Nova that the parliamentary and Senate elections 
bill had been worked out by the ODS with an eye to gaining the 
ODS a position of advantage.

  [Text] Presov, East Slovakia, March 27 (CTK) -- The 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) today called on the 
present government coalition not to drive the critical situation 
to a head but stick to political culture. In a statement from a 
two-day HZDS conference which ended today, the HZDS urged the 
government to halt dismissals of state functionaries for 
political reasons. 
  HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar delivered a closing speech to 
the conference, but journalists were not briefed about its 
details. At a press conference earlier in the day, Meciar hinted 
his speech would analyze the situation in Slovakia since the 
June 1992 parliamentary election to date. He said that 
shortcomings which appeared in HZDS activities in that period 
were due to peoples' failures but also discrepancies in the 
system. Meciar said that the HZDS had approved a positive 
manifesto as a basis for a future government programme, and 
elected leading officials who would implement it. 
  The HZDS conference approved new statutes whose wording 
brings the movement's activity closer to that of a political 
party.

  [Text] Tirana, March 29 (ATA) -- In the meeting with 
Premier Aleksander Meksi, the Danish foreign minister, Petersen, 
said that his government has planned to give priority to Albania 
in the fields of economy, education and health. He showed 
interest in the aspects of the reforms in various fields of life 
in Albania. Premier Meksi spoke about the successes and 
difficulties of these reforms, underlining the aid by and 
cooperation with different European countries and the beginning 
of investments in these fields by foreign firms and companies. 
He said that despite the tendency of some families to settle in 
urban zones, over 65 per cent of the population of Albania lives 
in the countryside. Investments in infrastructure will make 
possible the employment of a considerable number of people. 
  Mr. Meksi and Mr. Petersen also talked about oil researches 
in the sea and in the land, joint ventures in the mineral 
processing industry and the reform in the Albanian Army and 
police.

  [Text] Tirana, March 29 (ATA) -- The Kosova question, the 
question of the Albanians in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], and the situation in the region 
in general were in the centre of the talk held on March 28 
between the chairman of the Parliamentary Commission of Foreign 
Affairs of the People's Assembly, Eduard Selami, and the foreign 
minister of Denmark, Niels Helveg Petersen. 
  With regard to the above questions, Mr. Selami presented the 
Albanian viewpoint laying the stress on the indispensability of 
the embargo towards Serbia, and the conditioning of its lifting 
with the solution of the Kosova question. He also explained the 
reasons why Albania recognized Macedonia, and one of them is the 
recognition of the rights of the Albanians in Macedonia. 
  After he mentioned the three-year aid program by the Danish 
Government for Albania, Mr. Petersen concentrated on the 
situation in the region, in which there is a progress in the 
direction of involving the Serbs in the process. Regarding the 
question of Kosova, he said that he is for the presence of the 
CSCE observers, for an extended autonomy for Kosova and for a 
continuous pressure on Serbia. 
  Mr. Selami explained to Mr. Petersen how the parliamentary 
commissions function.

  [Text] Tirana, March 28 (ATA) -- Denmark is resolute to 
support Albania at all levels. It appreciates Albanian foreign 
policy regarding the solution of the crisis in the region and it 
is for an extended autonomy of Kosova, Danish foreign minister, 
Petersen, said today at a joint press conference with his 
Albanian counterpart, Serreqi. 
  Mr. Petersen said that Denmark will contribute to Albania's 
support in the European Community and to its closer relations 
with the NATO. Mr. Petersen mentioned education, health, and 
legislation as the fields in which Denmark may assist Albania. 
He confirmed that his government has accorded to Albania a fund 
of 15 million corona which will be delivered soon. 
  Concerning the situation in the region and considering the 
Kosova question as fundamental for the resolution of the crisis, 
Mr. Petersen said he was for an extended autonomy of Kosova and 
a continuous pressure on the Serbs. 
  Mr. Serreqi confirmed that in the talks they had, they also 
discussed the creation of a legal basis which will carry forward 
the bilateral relations. These relations will be based on some 
agreements, among which he mentioned the removal of double 
taxation, protection of investments, cooperation in economy, 
education and culture. 
  In response to a question regarding a UN approval for the 
dispatch of Turkish troops in Bosnia, Mr. Serreqi said that the 
process of peace calls for a great support and not prejudices. 
In his opinion, the countries that responded to the UN appeal 
should be congratulated. 
  Asked whether the stand of Denmark regarding the solution of 
the crisis in the former Yugoslavia is the same as that of the 
12 European countries, Mr. Petersen replied that the community 
has decided to act in unison on this issue, underlining that the 
plan for joint international actions is the basis for a peaceful 
solution. The plan of the community appeals to the Serbs of 
Bosnia to make territorial concessions. 
  In reply to a question on the coincidence of the visits of 
the three foreign ministers to Albania and the visit of 
President Berisha to Great Britain, Mr. Serreqi said that this 
is related with a re-appreciation of the Albanian factor in the 
Balkans and an estimation for the Tirana foreign policy.

  [Text] Tirana, March 29 (ATA) -- During the meeting with 
the Danish foreign minister, Petersen, the speaker of the 
parliament, Pjeter Arbnori, said that like in the past, during 
the years under the communist dictatorship as well, the 
Albanians have always had confidence in the aid of the 
democratic Europe. 
  Mr. Arbnori told the Danish delegation about the composition 
and work of the new pluralistic parliament for the realisation 
of the reform both in the legislative and economic fields. We 
are convinced that we may have mistakes during the economic 
reform we are carrying out but some of them are artificially 
created by the opposition, Mr. Arbnori said. He illustrated his 
statement with the hindrances that the parliamentary commission 
charged with the preparation of the draft of the constitution 
ins encountering. Through these hindrances, the opposition aims 
at bringing Albania back where it was, in a neocommunist 
dictatorship, as it is happening somewhere in Eastern Europe, 
Mr. Arbnori said. 
  Mr. Petersen asked further information about the law on the 
distribution of the land in the countryside, the efforts for the 
new constitution, the resources of Albania and the system of 
taxes applied in this country. 
  Mr. Petersen said that in the context of a three year plan 
for the Eastern and Central European countries, Denmark has 
accorded Albania a considerable financial aid.

<F P=106> ["Press Conference of Belgian and Albanian Foreign </F>
Ministers" -- ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, March 25 (ATA) -- "Belgium will support 
Albania in all the fields and many possibilities exist for 
Tirana to extent its relations with the European Union," Willy 
Claes said at a press conference held in Tirana on March 24. 
There is no doubt that in a short time Albania will present its 
request for associate agreements with the European Union, he 
added. 
  Minister Serreqi said that the talks with his Belgian 
counterpart were characterized by a complete political will for 
the positive development and the prospective of Albania's mutual 
relations which are especially important for Albania in the 
transition period. The two ministers had also agreed in the 
talks to sign as soon as possible several agreements, such as 
the agreement for the encouragement and protection of the 
investments, the agreement for removal of double taxation, for 
economic cooperation in different fields and the extention of 
cultural and technical relations. 
  According to Mr. Serreqi, the visit of Mr. Claes to Albania 
was important in many aspects. Mr. Claes came to Albania as a 
member of the EU troika, being at the same time one of the most 
selected partner in the talks on Albania's integration into the 
European structures and its cooperation with the European Union. 
  Concerning the tense situation in the region, Mr. Serreqi 
said that Albania's foreign policy was appreciated in the talks 
and that they had fully agreed on their views and options 
regarding a resolution to the Balkan crisis. 
  Mr. Claes said that a solution to the Kosova question is one 
of the most essential components for the resolution of the whole 
crisis in the former Yugoslavia, and at the same time it is the 
only option which can bring about a definitive solution. Mr. 
Claes said that the components of the crisis in the region 
should not be separated and this idea had been also emphasized 
in the troika meeting with representatives of Croatia and 
Bosnia. Kosova, Mr. Claes said, is one of the components and 
its question must be solved through granting it an extended 
autonomy. 
  Answering a question in regard to the presence of the 
international protectorate in order to guarantee the status of 
the Kosova autonomy, Mr. Claes said he could not give any 
opinion before the negotiations. But, he added that as in the 
case with Bosnia-Herzegovina, the European Union will insist in 
observing any agreement which can be signed. Mr. Claes said 
that everything depends on what the parties will demand from the 
international community. 
  Asked about what he meant by "an extended autonomy for 
Kosova," Mr. Claes said that it is not the union which will 
define what are the Albanians going to request, adding that he 
was of the opinion that Kosova must be granted an extended 
autonomy in political and cultural aspect. "For us," Mr. Claes 
said, "this concept comprises not only individual but collective 
rights as well." 
  Answering a question by a Belgian reporter, Mr. Serreqi said 
that Kosova must never be considered as an interior problem of 
Serbia. The war in Bosnia, Mr. Serreqi said, has left the Kosova 
question in oblivion to some extend, but the crisis in former 
Yugoslavia cannot be resolved unless a solution for Kosova is 
found.

<F P=106> ["Statement of Deputy Uran Butka Before the Parliament" -- </F>
ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, March 24 (ATA) -- Concerning the genocide 
of the Serbian occupiers in Kosova, I think that our parliament 
must issue an official statement before the national and 
international opinions. It should also be sent to the European 
Parliament and the parliaments of all the countries in order to 
find the indispensable international support for a correct 
solution of the Kosova question. I think that a parliamentary 
commission must be created to prepare the statement which then 
will be discussed and adopted by the parliament. 
  Secondly, I think it is necessary to juridically denounce 
the 
bloody communist Enverist dictatorship not only for the 
monstrous crimes it committed to the Albanian people but for the 
real threat that danger that its offsprings are posting to 
democracy. The problems which need indispensably be solved are: 
  1. Enverian dictatorship should be juridically denounced. 
  2. Antinational criminal figures such as Enver Hoxha and the 
main former communist leaders should be brought to court for 
their crimes to the Albanian people. 
  3. The titles "Hero of the People" and attributions stemming 
from it entitled so far to persons that are responsible for 
grave crimes towards the Albanian people, should be lifted. It 
is a pity that this title has not yet been removed from the 
hangsman Enver Hoxha. At the same time it is a paradox that 
Shefqet Peci, a criminal notorious for the massacres and 
sentences without trial in Gjirokaster, Libohove, Mirdite, 
Kukes, and Kosova [as received]. Peci should be sent to trial 
and not be a "Hero of the People." 
  4. Although our parliament has renounced the prescription 
for the crimes, no judicial process have yet been held for the 
crimes committed during the 50 year communist regime by 
criminals such as Ramiz Alia, Aranit Cela, Manush Myftiu, and 
former interior ministers, who besides the crimes, they have 
also ordered the elimination of the documents in the archives of 
the Republic of Albania. 
  Ramiz Alia is not only co-responsible with Enver Hoxha, but 
he also is to be blamed for the violence over the pioneers of 
democracy, for murders in the border which he himself has 
ordered during his rule over Albania. Ramiz Alia ordered that 
fire be opened against the refugees, he ordered arrests and 
imprisonments, maltreatments and the sending to psychiatric 
hospitals of those who took part in the demonstrations and who 
toppled the busts of the dictators. Ramiz Alia ordered for the 
April 2 massacre and many others. 
  The democratic states in the world have punished and 
continue 
to punish the Nazi criminals and the past and present terrors. 
  We do not urge political trials but trials against illegal 
and inhuman state crime, genocide and massive terror exercised 
by the hangmen who not only do not apologise but yet continue 
their efforts to deny the present democracy. 
  There has not been and will not yet be any Nurenberg in the 
postcommunist Albania although there is enough evidence for the 
crimes and criminals on national scale. 
  The Albanian people terrorized by the communist 
dictatorship, 
the formerly politically persecuted and their families have not 
manifested any sign of revenge, but they demand justice. They 
are convinced that the parliament and the Albanian democratic 
state will solve this question. 
  The abuse must not be everlasting because the entire 
persecuted Albanian people need relief from the extraordinary 
hatred accumulated by the 50 year violations, they need peace 
and spiritual harmony, stability and love for one another, 
national spirit and consciousness, on order that they be able to 
work and live in democracy.

  [Text] Sofia, March 30 (BTA) -- Bulgaria's President 
Zhelyu Zhelev is on an informal visit to London. He told a news 
conference there that early parliamentary elections will 
probably be held in Bulgaria before the end of this year. This 
morning the [Bulgarian] national radio aired the president's 
comments on home policy issues at the press conference in London. 
  In connection with a commentary in THE FINANCIAL TIMES that 
Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's state of health (after a heart 
failure in early March he underwent surgery) might provoke a 
political crisis and early elections, thus delaying the reform 
process, the President said: "The problem is not the PM's state 
of health. He will recover and I am sure that a month from now 
he will be even more efficient than before. The problem is that 
the government itself is flawed, and so is the formula of its 
formation." The present cabinet was formed at the end of 1992 
as a government of experts, not affiliated to any party. 
  President Zhelev blamed the cabinet for counting too much on 
the support of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (the former 
communists) and pointed out that it ought to pursue its reform 
programme, taking the risk of losing parliament's support. 
According to the president, there are two possible solutions: 
"Either this parliament will have to appoint a non-communist 
government, backed by the Union of Democratic Forces, the New 
Union for Democracy, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, and 
the independent MP's, that would pursue the reforms 
consistently, or we are heading for elections." It seems that 
elections will be held before the end of this year, he said. 
  When asked whether a possible new cabinet, dominated by the 
BSP (ranking first in opinion polls), would not make matters 
even worse in regard to the reform, President Zhelev was 
positive that the BSP is unable to form a cabinet. "In my 
opinion, the BSP will find it hard to dominate the future 
parliament. The problem it faces is not how to win the 
elections; that will not be very difficult. The hard part of it 
will come after the elections, when its victory will be of no 
use, as it will be unable to form a cabinet," he said. 
  As to the steep rise of the key currencies against the 
Bulgarian lev in the past few weeks, President Zhelev believes 
it to be the result of speculation. Certain circles in Bulgaria 
will benefit from that, as enterprises put up for privatization 
will be twice cheaper, he explained. According to the 
president, the central bank and the government can take measures 
to stabilize the national currency, but the important point is 
to step up privatization and restitution.

  [Text] Sofia, March 30 (BTA) -- In the course of his formal 
visit to Albania completed yesterday, Bulgarian Foreign Minister 
Stanislav Daskalov and his Albanian partners expressed a wish to 
promote bilateral relations to build up trust in the Balkans. 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko Vlaykov today met the press to 
elaborate on the visit. 
  Asked if Bulgaria and Albania differed on the UN Security 
Council decision to send Turkish peacekeepers to former 
Yugoslavia, Vlaykov said this issue was only considered in the 
course of the general review of the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Daskalov reiterated the Bulgarian call on 
neighbouring countries to refrain from participation in the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. 
  Vlaykov said during a joint press conference of the 
Bulgarian 
and Albanian foreign ministers in Tirana yesterday, Daskalov was 
asked about the Bulgarian position on Kosovo. He said Bulgaria 
opposed any interference by foreign forces in seeking a solution 
to this internal problem.

  [Text] Sofia, March 29 (BTA) -- German Federal Minister of 
Defence Volker Ruehe, who came on an official three-day visit to 
Sofia at the head of a German military delegation yesterday, was 
received by Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev and First 
Deputy Foreign Minister Valentin Gatsinski. 
  Mr. Matinchev familiarized Mr. Ruehe with the political 
priorities of the Bulgarian Government, the difficulties in 
implementing the economic reform and Bulgaria's losses ensuing 
from the Yugo-embargo. Mr. Matinchev emphasized that Bulgaria 
attaches paramount importance to Germany's support in settling 
its external debt problem by signing arrangements with the Paris 
and the London clubs, the Government Press Office said. Mr. 
Ruehe said that following the processes in Bulgaria, the German 
Government sees some positive signs. In answer to the Bulgarian 
Government's request that Germany ratify Bulgaria's Europe 
Agreement before the summer recess of the Bundestag, Mr. Ruehe 
said that the agreement had already been endorsed by the 
Committee on Foreign Policy and was now being considered by the 
Economic Committee. According to Mr. Ruehe, the German 
Government will do its best to help Bulgaria resolve its 
financial problems in the shortest possible time. 
  Today the German military delegation had a meeting with 
First 
Deputy Foreign Minister Valentin Gatsinski. They discussed 
issues concerning Bulgaria's relations with its neighbours and 
Russia, the situation in the Balkans, the possibilities for 
strengthening security in the region, and the Partnership for 
Peace plan. In connection with the inclusion of Turkish troops 
in the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces in Bosnia, Mr. 
Gatsinski confirmed the Bulgarian position that no Balkan 
countries should intervene in the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict in 
any form.

<F P=106> [Report by Andrey Sharkov] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, March 28 (BTA) -- "We are the country to 
open the doors of all Western institutions for Bulgaria," German 
Federal Minister of Defense Volker Ruehe today told journalists 
on the first day of his three-day formal visit to this country. 
Mr. Ruehe is here at the invitation of his Bulgarian 
counterpart Valentin Aleksandrov. This is the first visit by a 
German defense minister to this country for the past 70 years. 
  Valentin Aleksandrov and Volker Ruehe today signed an 
agreement on cooperation between the German and Bulgarian 
defense ministries. "This is the third document on bilateral 
cooperation in the military sphere but I am deeply convinced 
that its contribution to cooperation will be greater than that 
of the conventions with the central powers and the Tripartite 
Pact," the Bulgarian Defense Minister said after the signing of 
the agreement. During World War One and Two, and until the 
monarchy's downfall in 1944, Bulgaria was allied to Germany. 
  Germany can do much more for Bulgaria than just give it the 
military equipment of the former East Germany, Defense Minister 
Ruehe said, answering a question. According to him, material 
and technical aid would not be in the spirit and letter of the 
agreement signed today. Germany, however, might deliver spare 
parts to this country. The outdated military equipment of the 
Bundeswehr, including that of the ex-East German Army, was 
either donated or sold to other countries under agreements 
effective in the Warsaw-Pact times, Mr. Ruehe said. 
  Investing in material things is now outdated. Investing in 
people -- in the exchange of trainees and expertise -- this is 
the investment of the future, the investment of friendship," the 
German Defense Minister said, commenting on the agreement the 
two ministries signed today. The document envisages the 
extending of technical and economic assistance to Bulgaria. 
  The newly signed agreement is more or less identical with 
those Bulgaria has signed with the other NATO member-states, 
Valentin Aleksandrov told journalists. It provides for exchange 
of information pertaining to the political and legal aspects of 
defence, the Armed Forces management and cooperation in some 
specific military sub-sectors, including officers training. The 
goals set forth in this agreement will be accomplished through 
visits by delegations and working groups to exchange information 
and through exchange of trainees. 
  The sides also exchanged views on the Yugocrisis during 
talks 
between the top officials of the two defense ministries. The 
meeting, however, did not discuss the UN decision to sent 
Turkish "blue helmets" on a peacekeeping mission in former 
Yugoslavia. "The agreement between Muslims and Croats is already 
yielding results. I hope the sides will find a just solution to 
this issue," Mr. Ruehe also told journalists. 
  In their recent history, the two countries started 
exchanging 
delegation in 1991 when a group of Bulgarian officers visited 
the NATO Academy in Oberammergau, Germany. According to a 
statement made by President Zhelev, this marked the beginning of 
a closer Bulgaria-NATO cooperation. A Bulgarian delegation led 
by Valentin Aleksandrov last autumn paid a visit to Germany, the 
first one after half a century's break. During that visit, the 
two countries reached specific agreements for a closer 
cooperation, including the training of Bulgarian officers at the 
Bundeswehr academy in Hamburg and at the military school in 
Muenster. And the exchange of military delegation tends to get 
busier.

<F P=106> [Report by Evgeniya Drumeva: "Opposition SDS on Foreign </F>
Exchange Market and Government Economic Policy"] 
  [Text] Sofia, March 29 (BTA) -- The economic situation in 
this country is rapidly deteriorating, and one of the main 
reasons is the government's failure to attain its economic and 
financial objectives, the National Coordinating Council (the top 
leadership) of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) 
found at its meeting today. According to SDS, because of the 
crisis of political confidence in the government the lev lost 
nearly half its price against the U.S. dollar in the last three 
weeks. As long as this crisis of political confidence is 
deepening, nothing could stabilize the financial and 
foreign-exchange markets, said Ivan Kostov MP of SDS, former 
finance minister in two successive governments, in 1991 and 1992. 
  Back when the cabinet of independent economist Lyuben Berov 
was voted into office at the end of 1992, SDS declared itself 
against the "cabinet of independent experts" formula. Since 
that time, the opposition coalition has repeatedly pressed for 
early parliamentary elections and a politically committed 
government. 
  A week ago, SDS moved at the National Assembly a question to 
the government about its economic and financial policy and 
declared that after it hears the reply, it would demand the 
National Assembly to take a stand. "I expect parliament to 
criticize the cabinet for its actions and inactions which 
disrupted the country's economic system," Mr. Kostov told 
reporters today. In case the majority votes down such a stand, 
SDS will move yet another vote of no confidence in the cabinet. 
  The ex-Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), which 
holds 
the majority in parliament at present, takes a softer line on 
the performance of the government. A week ago BSP called for 
faster and more resolute measures to end speculation on the 
foreign-exchange market and the lev depreciation. At the same 
time, however, the Socialists' leader Zhan Videnov said that 
"the foreign debt negotiations, rather than the dollar rate, are 
the government's top priority now". According to the 
Socialists, no personnel changes could be made now either in the 
government, or in the institutions concerned with the foreign 
debt negotiations. 
  SDS, however, believes that the cabinet has failed to reach 
a 
favourable agreement with the London Club creditor banks. SDS 
economists argue that Poland received a better offer in 
principle on a settlement of its loan. According to Ivan 
Kostov, this is further confirmed by "the fact that the 
foreign-exchange reserves and the expected financial grant and 
loan aid from abroad will not be sufficient for the government 
to attain its two goals: To close a deal with the London Club 
and keep the rate of the Bulgarian currency stable". "In the 
present currency market conditions, the depletion of 
foreign-exchange reserves makes financial stability practically 
impossible. All measures taken by the cabinet and the National 
Bank of Bulgaria proved counterproductive with their influence 
on the financial and foreign-exchange market. Instead of 
achieving stability and halting the Bulgarian lev depreciation, 
in reality we witness just the opposite. We believe the main 
reason is that this government has already lost political 
credibility with almost everybody in this country", Mr. Kostov 
believes.

  [Text] Sofia, March 30 (BTA) -- Again the leading national 
dailies did not come out this morning in a continuing protest 
against the 18 percent flat VAT [value-added tax] rate, due to 
take effect on April 1 and from which the media are not exempt. 
The six private radio stations in Sofia which suspended their 
broadcasts for two days in protest against the tax are back on 
the air today but every hour on the hour they will air protest 
noise effects. The only paper to come out was BULGARSKA ARMIYA 
the daily of the Defence Ministry. Today it carries an interview 
with Deputy Defence Minister Boyko Noev about his visit to the 
United States last week. 
  The CASH weekly which came out today has blank spaces 
instead 
of text and carries only advertisements. "This is what a 
censored newspaper would look like," it is written on the front 
page. Any attempt to levy VAT on the press, no matter what 
motivates it, is pure censorship in the form of liquidation, 
reads the commentary in this weekly. 
  A rally of intellectuals is scheduled to take place this 
afternoon in support of the media protest. The editors-in-chief 
of the leading national dailies will meet tonight to discuss the 
forms in which to continue their protest.

<F P=106> [Report by Mariyana Barutchieva: "The Currency Market Today"] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, March 29 (BTA) -- Today the Interbank 
Currency Market was blocked by the high exchange rate of the 
U.S. dollar against the lev. While in the morning the dollar 
was sold between 56 and 58 leva, in the afternoon it reached 
78-79 leva. 
  Most of the larger commercial banks withdrew from the 
Interbank Market today and sold foreign exchange mainly to their 
regular clients for 58-59 leva/$1. "Panic reigns, the market is 
paralyzed," said a dealer from one of the large banks who 
preferred not to be named. It is absurd to predict to what 
heights the dollar and the other key currencies might rise, he 
said. In his opinion, the rate of the depreciation of the leva 
is not so alarming if compared to the rate of inflation. The 
"panic" was created by the skyrocketing prices of the foreign 
currencies which he described as "unprecedented". 
  Tension mounts with the saltatory rise of the hard 
currencies 
against the lev and people rush headlong to turn their deposits 
into foreign exchange. "They are ready to buy any currency, no 
matter what the price is," this reporter learned in an exchange 
office. Demand is high, the inadequate supply raises tension 
additionally, dealers said. The interest rates on 6-month 
deposits no longer attract the population. 
  Some experts believe that the uncontrolled rise of the 
foreign exchange against the lev can be stopped by fixing the 
exchange rate of the key currencies against the lev or even by 
suspension of the currency market. That would set a precedent 
for an economy which claims to be market-oriented, say 
transactors in the Interbank Market. 
  In the exchange offices the dollar's price rose to 80-85 
leva. The German mark also reached unprecedented prices ranging 
between 39 and 45 leva. Many of the exchange offices used the 
cross rate to calculate the rate of the Deutsche Mark on the 
basis of a rate of 67 leva/$1. The British pound was sold 
between 100 and 120 leva. Most of the exchange offices were 
selling actively in order to close their long positions. 
  A dealer from a large state-owned bank who asked not to be 
named said that later in the afternoon transactions were made at 
about 65 leva/$1. All transactors in the Interbank Market are 
expecting drastic measures from the central bank. The national 
radio quoted the central bank's Governor Prof. Todor Vulchev, as 
saying: "We know what we have to do in the next few days to 
reassure people and to reverse the process of depreciation of 
the lev." 
  From March 1 to March 30 the central exchange rate of the 
U.S. dollar rose by 23.083 leva, and so did the German mark and 
the British pound, respectively by 14.342 leva and 34.869 leva. 
According to the national bank, some $6,354,937.33 were bought 
and $5,178,413.98 were sold in the Interbank Market today. The 
central exchange rate of the dollar for tomorrow is set at 
60.609 leva, i.e. nearly 6 leva higher than today's central 
exchange rate.

  [Text] Prague, March 29 (CTK) -- It is an alarming signal 
for further coalition talks when one of the coalition parties 
has such a clearly defined stand before talks even start, 
Chairman of the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) Jan Kalvoda told 
CTK today. He was reacting to the fact that the leadership of 
the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the strongest party in the 
government coalition, confirmed at a meeting today its intention 
to push for Senate elections in 81 one-mandate constituencies. 
Asked about the ODA's further approach at talks on the system of 
Senate elections Kalvoda said he would consider it tragic for 
the coalition if it was unable to agree on a government bill on 
senatorial elections to be submitted to parliament. 
  Meanwhile, Josef Lux, chairman of another coalition party -- 
the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party 
(KDU-CSL) -- told CTK that both variants for Senate elections -- 
the ODS's and that of other coalition parties which prefer 
Senate elections being held in 27 three-mandate constituencies 
-- conform with the constitution and the majority election 
system. What is essential is that the system is clear and 
transparent, Lux said, adding it was not any fundamental dispute 
between the coalition parties. These questions will be further 
discussed and if no agreement is reached it is up to Parliament 
to decide, he said. "We are prepared to discuss any variant," he 
added.

  [Text] Prague, March 29 (CTK) -- The system of 81 
one-mandate constituencies for Senate elections on which the 
Civic Democratic Party (ODS) insists could bring regional 
deviations during the elections and destabilize the political 
spectrum, the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) says in a 
statement given to CTK today. 
  The statement has come in reaction to today's meeting of the 
leadership of the ODS, the strongest party in the government 
coalition, which confirmed ODS's intention to push for Senate 
elections in 81 one-mandate constituencies, although other 
coalition parties, including the KDS, prefer a system of 27 
three-mandate constituencies. 
  The KDS is disappointed that the ODS is not willing to 
discuss other variants for Senate elections, the statement says. 
It adds, however, that regardless its reservations towards the 
ODS's stand the "KDS respects the Czech Constitution" and 
considers it more important that the Constitution be observed 
than that its own model of Senate elections be implemented. 
  The Senate, an upper house of the Czech Parliament, is 
defined in the Constitution but has not yet been filled.

  [Text] Prague, March 29 (CTK) -- It is not lack of 
communication between the coalition partners, but differences in 
opinion and attitudes towards various questions which led to 
Monday's [28 March] meeting of coalition leaders not resulting 
in agreement, Vaclav Klaus, Czech Premier and chairman of the 
Civic Democratic Party (ODS) said today. 
  ODS is the largest of the four coalition parties. The other 
three are the Christian Democratic Party (KDS), the Civic 
Democratic Alliance (ODA), and the Christian Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL). Their chairmen met 
on Monday to discuss the electoral laws, local and central 
government reform, restitution and Jewish property issues. 
  Speaking on Czech Radio, Klaus said that the coalition 
partners had different attitudes towards restitution and the 
creation of parliament's second chamber, the Senate, the need 
for which he said was "highly controversial." The third 
problem, he said, was regional administrative arrangements. 
"These opinions are truly different, and no amount of 
communication can level them in any way," Klaus said. 
  The coalition would definitely find a compromise, he said. 
However, everybody had to be aware that a compromise was not 
"this or that smaller political party insisting that the problem 
will be solved precisely the way it wants."

  [Text] Prague, March 29 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav 
Havel today appointed Pavel Varvarovsky the fifteenth and the 
last justice to the Czech Constitutional Court. Justice Minister 
Jiri Novak and Constitutional Court Chairman Zdenek Kessler 
attended the ceremony. In his address Havel voiced satisfaction 
that the Constitutional Court had been filled. He said the 
Court was a guarantee that the state would serve all its 
citizens and would exercise its power in the framework of the 
law. Through its decisions about the constitutionality of laws 
and other legal norms the Constitutional Court significantly 
influences the legislative process of their preparation and 
drafting, Havel said. The Constitutional Court helps to ensure 
that the law in the Czech Republic is brought into harmony with 
the legal norms of the European Union, he added. Minister Novak 
also expressed satisfaction that the Constitutional Court was 
complete and could start working within its full complement. 
Under the Czech Constitution the President appoints justices to 
the Constitutional Court with the agreement of the Senate, an 
upper house in the Czech Parliament. As the Senate has not yet 
been filled, its functions are carried out by the Chamber of 
Deputies. 
  Varvarovsky was born in 1945 in Ceske Budejovice, south 
Bohemia. He worked as a judge in the Supreme Court Trade 
Division. He is a permanent resident of Brno, where the 
Constitutional Court is situated. In the Constitutional Court 
he will be acting as an expert in administrative law, the field 
he was engaged in while working in the Supreme Court. 
  The law on the Constitutional Court took effect last June. 
The first 12 justices were appointed by Havel in July, after 
their candidacies were approved by parliament, and the other two 
in November. Havel submitted a proposal to Parliament this 
January for appointing the fifteenth and the last justice. 
  The Constitutional Court is designed to protect the 
Constitution. It is composed of 15 justices who are appointed 
for the time of 10 years. The Constitutional Court justice 
starts exercising his duties after swearing an oath to the 
president.

  [Text] Brno, South Moravia, March 29 (CTK) -- Parliament 
has so far received no information about the return of the 
property of the former Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSC), 
which was decided on by a federal parliament law of 1990, deputy 
Jiri Karas told journalists today. 
  The process had obviously been impeded by problems of 
economic reform and the division of Czechoslovakia but, he said, 
"it should still be stated what has been done with the 
property." He said he had submitted questions to Economics 
Minister Karel Dyba, to which he expected answers within 30 days. 
  In 1990 the KSC property was reckoned to be worth some 30 
billion crowns but current estimates rate it at around 13 
billion ($433 million). Karas himself believes the value of the 
property to be 15 or 16 billion crowns, although no inventory 
has been drawn up.

  [Text] Prague, March 29 (CTK) -- The Council of the 
Bohemian-Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS) expressed 
unhappiness about "undemocratic comments made by politicians and 
journalists on unions and the union-organized rally," CMKOS 
spokesman Vaclav Jurina told CTK today. Rejecting especially 
remarks made by Premier Vaclav Klaus, the Council said they 
expected Klaus to "apologize" at a CMKOS meeting due in April, 
Jurina said. Klaus described the March 22 rally as a position 
taken by a group of people, adding that essential Czech policy 
questions are not decided at rallies but in parliament. The 
former was possible in February 1948, but "is not possible on 
March 22, 1994," Klaus said, referring to the 1948 Communist 
coup. Jurina said that in pressing for its demands (for better 
terms for workers), the council would "harden its attitude in 
collective bargaining." He said the Council intended to hold 
regional demonstrations, put pressure on employers and deputies, 
and conduct its own public opinion surveys. CMKOS will also 
adopt a stricter line on defending employees "affected by the 
employment law," Jurina said, adding that the Council warned 
union members against allowing themselves to be manipulated by 
political parties as part of the political game. Union members 
should "reject all attempt to be drawn into unpremeditated and 
pseudo-radical actions," Jurina said.

  [Text] Prague, March 29 (CTK) -- In view of the 
transformation of the Czech Army, the number of military 
airplanes will be reduced by 30.6 percent against the present 
situation, Air Force and Air Defense Inspector Pavel Strubl said 
at a press conference today. Seventy-seven fighter planes, 11 
helicopters, 20 training planes, 10 transport and special 
planes, and 20 transport helicopters will be withdrawn from 
service. 
  In 1994 and 1995, the Czech Army will operate at six 
airports, later at five airports, General Strubl added. 
  Asked by journalists what the fate of the Soviet-made 
turbo-jet fighters MiG-29 would be, Strubl said that the command 
of the Czech Army decided not to buy any more aircraft equipment 
from the countries of the former USSR. "It would be uneconomic 
to operate only 10 MiG-29 planes," Strubl said. All 
transformation intentions within the army are built mainly on 
present economic possibilities, he added. 
  The transformation of the Air Force will afflict some 250 
pilots. "We will do our best to provide them with jobs in the 
aircraft area," Strubl stressed. He added that he held 
negotiations with several firms, including Czechoslovak 
Airlines, which showed interest in the pilots. 
  The gradual modernization of Czech Air Force will be 
launched 
this year by a purchase of training aircrafts Z-142. Airplanes 
L- 159, helicopters and transport planes are to be bought after 
1997, and multi-purpose super sound planes after the year 2000, 
Strubl said. The Czech Air Force should be completely 
re-equipped by 2005, Strubl said.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 30 -- President Lech Walesa meeting 
with editorial staff of the "SLOWO-DZIENNIK KATOLICKI" daily on 
Wednesday said that he has "no deal" with Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak concerning Dariusz Rosati's candidacy for the 
post of deputy prime minister and finance minister which the 
president rejected on Friday. 
  Walesa, asked whether there is a chance of a compromise in 
the Rosati affair, replied, "Do they want me to desert?" He 
added that it is necessary to find a new candidate for that post 
as quickly as possible. 
  The president referring to the 1994 budget bill, passed by 
the Senate and the Sejm and waiting for the signature of the 
president, said that "for today" he would not sign the budget. 
In his opinion "the nation has been once again cheated, it was 
to be better." He added that he is in despair "from the economic 
point of view" as he knows that apart from minor shifts, nothing 
much can be changed in the budget.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 29 -- Privatization Minister Wieslaw 
Kaczmarek told a press conference on Tuesday that the Mass 
Privatization Programme (PPP) is implemented according to 
schedule. 
  Some 470 enterprises have expressed their readiness to take 
part in the programme, 110 of them decided join the PPP just 
recently. The list with the names of the enterprises will be 
presented to the government economic committee for opinion in 
the near future. 
  There are plans to set up about 12 national investments 
funds 
which will manage the property of enterprises taking part in the 
programme. "The programme is open and if there are enterprises 
(wishing to join the programme, ed.) we will set up successive 
funds," Kaczmarek said. 
  The minister said that a ranking list of consortia applying 
to manage up the national investment funds will be ready at the 
beginning of April. A special selection commission received 33 
offers. 
  Head of the commission, Krzysztof Rutkowski said that 
following the evaluation of technical offers, which is in its 
final stage, the commission will move on to the opening of price 
offers. He said that technical offers included a number of very 
interesting solutions creating greater chances for the success 
of the PPP. 
  The commission will also have a list of some 240 candidates 
for members of the funds' supervisory boards at the start of May. 
  Rutkowski said the commission received 6,860 application. 
From that group, the commission will select 500 candidates who 
will be summoned for interviews. Finally, the commission will 
decide on the final list and an additional list of some 50 
candidates for chairmen of the boards. 
  The funds are expected to be registered at the end of July 
or 
at the start of August. The distribution of shares certificates 
is planned for the first months of next year. According to 
polls some 9 million people accept the programme and are willing 
to buy such certificates. The shares will be quoted at the 
Warsaw stock exchange not earlier than in the second half of 
next year.

  [Text] Krakow, March 30 -- Hungarian President Arpad Goncz 
on Wednesday ended his Polish visit and left for Budapest from 
Krakow where earlier in the day he had toured the Wawel Royal 
Castle and met with professors and students of the Jagiellonian 
University. 
  Addressing a news conference at the university, Goncz 
stressed that politically "Poland and Hungary want to become a 
part of Europe," but culturally "the two countries have always 
been its part." 
  "We will submit European Union full membership motions at 
the 
same time which proves that we are the two pillars of the 
European stability," he said. 
  Speaking about a cooperation between Poland and Hungary, 
Goncz stated that it has interesting prospects, as "future 
Europe is not only the Europe of nations but also of regions." 
  The Hungarian head of state added that the Visegrad Group 
states, including Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and 
Slovakia, should go together on the road to a new Europe and 
that this cooperation does not need to be institutionalized.

Corps. Polish youth would travel to Canada on the same 
principles.

  [Text] Ottawa, March 30 -- Defence Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejdzyk and Canadian Minister of National Defence David 
Collenette on Tuesday expressed satisfaction with their two-day 
political talks. 
  At a meeting, not included on the agenda of a visit of the 
Polish minister, the Polish delegation again stressed the need 
to eliminate the so-called "grey spheres" of influence in 
Europe. In the interest of the lasting peace on the continent, 
the West should cover the region of Central and Eastern Europe 
with a "political screen," the Polish delegation claimed. 
  Earlier in the day, the Polish minister-led delegation met 
with Senate speaker Romeo Leblanc to discuss some European 
political issues, including the developments in the east of the 
continent. The politicians stressed the importance of friendly 
relations between Poland and Canada. Leblanc said he is 
satisfied with the signing of a package of military cooperation 
agreements between the two countries. 
  Later in the day, Kolodziejdzyk took part in the 
wreath-laying ceremony at the monument to the Canadian soldiers 
killed during the two world wars and then went to the Polish 
house in Ottawa to decorate twelve war veterans with the 
military crosses. 
  Kolodziejdzyk invited David Collenette to pay a visit to 
Poland. Minister Kolodziejdzyk in expected to hold a news 
conference on the results of his North American visit on 
Thursday.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 29/3/1994 -- We had talks on 
resuming and enlarging Romanian-Russian ties in all fields, 
which meets the interests of both parties, said Premier Nicolae 
Vacaroiu after his Tuesday, March 29, interview with the Russian 
minister of defence Pavel Grachev. Vacaroiu showed satisfaction 
at the signing of the military cooperation agreement between 
Romania and Russia. 
  The Russian guest revealed, for his part, the importance of 
the process of rebuilding a basis of cooperation between the two 
countries and mentioned that the agreement signed on the 
occasion of his visit provided a basis for cooperation in the 
defence industry, the training of Romanian officers in Russia, 
military drilling carried out jointly by the two countries, 
swaps of experts. 
  Opinions were also exchanged on the current economic and 
social situation of the two countries. Similarities were 
identified in most aspects reviewed, which made the two parties 
deem that efficient partnership in all the fields of interest 
for the two sides could be beneficial for both Romania and 
Russia. 
  Premier Vacaroiu was hopeful that the visit of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin to Romania, likely to take place this 
year, could mark a step further in strengthening 
Romanian-Russian links. 
  Attending were Romanian Minister of Defence Gheorghe Tinca 
and Secretary of State Ioan Mircea Pascu.

visit a country that we have specially good relations with," 
Romanian President Ion Iliescu told the press at the Otopeni 
airport on his departure for a two-day visit to Greece.

interests in the zone. 
  The agenda of the visit includes talks with Greek President 
Konstandinos Karamanlis, with Premier Andreas Papandreou, with 
representatives of political parties in the Greek Parliament, 
the first European parliament to have ratified Romania's

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 30/3/1994 -- The doctrine of the 
Romanian Democratic Agrarian Party [PDAR] and its position 
regarding the ruling political party are covered in an interview 
granted to the daily AZI by Agrarian Party's President Victor 
Surdu. 
  After the success scored in the 1992 local elections, the 
Romanian Democratic Agrarian Party, which had won then 15 
percent of the votes, had no similar performance in the 
parliamentary elections held the same year, currently holding 
representation only in the Senate. 
  Victor Surdu says: "We are looking for a new programme, 
based on the doctrine called modern agrarianism, of neoliberal 
concept, which sets property beyond everything. Starting from 
Romania's ties, we consider that we must gather all our efforts 
to solve the issues confronting Romania's agriculture such as 
involving a major number of extremely active people in the 
agriculture. If we start this important economic sector, job 
opportunities will show for almost 60 percent of the population, 
for which we could provide social protection and the dignity to 
have a job." 
  On the previous contacts with the ruling party and as 
regards 
the Agrarian Party's position as to the Vacaroiu cabinet, the 
Agrarian president said: "The dialogue with the Party of Social 
Democracy has led us to the conclusion that, if we cannot come 
into power, we are situated in the opposition which however 
supports the Vacaroiu government, but only under the provisions 
that government legislative decisions and initiatives would not 
run counter our programme." 
  "After the dialogue with all parliamentary parties, the 
ruling Party of Social Democracy should assume full 
responsibility for everything that happens in Romania at 
present," Victor Surdu was quoted as saying.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 29 (CTK) -- Ex-Premier Vladimir 
Meciar will be able to use the special personal protection 
provided to him by his cabinet on the last day of its existence 
for only three months. The new Slovak Government today 
abolished the resolution about special protection for the 
ex-premier till the end of the electoral term. 
  "We came to the conclusion that there are no reasons for 
special protection of Deputy Meciar," Slovak Deputy Premier Ivan 
Simko told journalists today. He said that under the law Meciar 
had the right to a personal bodyguard for three months and after 
that he could ask new Premier Jozef Moravcik to confirm the 
permission for his personal protection. 
  The Slovak Government today dismissed Anna Nagyova, Meciar's 
close co-worker, from the post of the head of the premier's 
Secretariat. 
  The cabinet also approved the proposal by Vice Premier 
Brigita Schmognerova for the dismissal of Chairman of the Slovak 
Statistics Office Rudolf Krc. Stefan Condik was proposed as new 
chairman. The proposal of Krc's dismissal and the appointment 
of his successor now has to be approved by the president.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 29 (CTK) -- Slovak Privatization 
Minister Milan Janicina does not want to prevent further 
privatization, and, if no complications arise, he will ask the 
finance minister to unblock the account of the National Property 
Fund (FNM), Janicina said at a press conference today. 
  Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus blocked the FNM account at 
Janicina's request, so that the actions of the previous 
government in transferring property could be examined. 
  Forty-five privatization projects, approved in an 
uncontrolled privatization activity by the government of 
Vladimir Meciar after February 14, were examined, Janicina said. 
Legal and other shortcomings were found in 13 of them, and thus 
these projects, approved by Meciar's cabinet, were canceled. 
  The privatization projects canceled by the decision of the 
new government include the privatization of the Piestany spa, 
the Tatran Bratislava publishing house, the Pohronsky Ruskov 
mill, the Humenne meat processing factory, and others. The 
projects will be examined by the Prosecutor's Office. Five of 
them might result in prosecution, Janicina said. 
  Deputy Premier Ivan Simko said that the cabinet had not 
looked at who were finally to acquire the privatized property, 
or whether any deputies from the former government coalition or 
their relatives stood behind the projects. However, Janicina 
added that next week he would have the information at his 
disposal on "which deputy lobbied for whose wife," including the 
enumeration of the property in individual cases. 
  Janicina also said he knew about a privatization project 
approved without all the property being included, and did not 
rule out the existence of further such cases. He therefore 
turned to the interior minister and Prosecutor General, asking 
them to establish a joint commission to continue examining the 
unclear privatization projects approved by Meciar's government. 
  Janicina said he was convinced that the abolition of the 
privatization projects could not damage Slovakia's image abroad. 
On the contrary, a privatization process which was pure from 
the legal point of view, should strengthen the confidence of 
foreign investors, he stressed.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 29 (CTK) -- Slovak Privatization 
Minister Milan Janicina today said that coupon privatization 
will be the chief method used in the second wave of 
privatization in Slovakia. Slovakia needs a speedy reform of 
the half-communist economic system, while having little capital 
and also little time, Janicina told CTK. 
  He did not dismiss other privatization methods, including 
direct sales, but said that in no case would they be used to the 
same extent as by the Meciar government. 
  "A government coalition deputy cannot be allowed to carry 
out 
a survey and then pass the property into his party colleague's 
hands," said Janicina. He sees direct sales linked mainly with 
foreign investments. 
  Janicina also believes that lucrative enterprises, such as 
Transgas or arms manufacturers, will be included in the second 
wave of voucher privatization. Although nearly 60 percent of 
Slovak enterprises are on the verge of bankruptcy and the real 
value of their property is deep below its nominal appraisal, 
Janicina sees no problem in selecting enterprises for coupon 
privatization. 
  Property worth 100 billion Slovak crowns will be set aside 
for coupon privatization. The government will seek to open the 
preliminary round before the autumn parliamentary elections.

  [Text] Trencin, West Slovakia, March 30 (CTK) -- The 
government of Jozef Moravcik and the parties that support it 
plan to launch the second wave of coupon privatization at the 
end of August, Peter Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left 
Party (SDL), told CTK today. 
  Weiss stated the SDL, a member of the new five party 
coalition government, had always supported a second wave of 
coupon privatization. "It is not just the only chance for people 
who otherwise wouldn't have enough money to take part in the 
privatization process, but it's also a form of investment in the 
future," Weiss said at the Trencin-Fashion City Trade Fair. 
  Weiss said he believed privatization should be a continuous 
process and thus it would be wrong to ask the government to 
shelve the process for six months. 
  Chairman of Parliament Ivan Gasparovic told CTK that he 
doubted the government would manage to prepare the second wave 
in time for the elections, scheduled for September 30 and 
October 1. Property worth 100 billion Slovak crowns ($3.1 
billion) is to be privatized in the second wave.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 29 (CTK) -- Half of Slovaks are 
disappointed with the way the members of parliament they elected 
are representing them and defending their interests, the results 
of a Slovak Statistical Office [SUSR] poll shows. The 
proportion of respondents satisfied with the parties in 
parliament is 25 percent. 
  The poll also asked whether people would have supported the 
referendum which former Premier Vladimir Meciar intended to hold 
on the validity of the parliamentary mandate of deputies who 
left the party they were elected for. Twelve percent felt 
"maverick" deputies should lose their seats. 
  Eighty-two percent said they believed a deputy should vote 
according to his own conscience rather than be obliged to follow 
the party line. 
  When asked if deputies should vote in the interests of their 
party, 52 percent said yes and 40 percent said no. Comparing 
answers to the last two questions it follows that some 41 
percent of respondents agree with both statements together, 
indicating, according to SUSR, voters were not well informed 
about the debate surrounding deputies' mandates.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 29 (CTK) -- The sad situation in 
Slovak schools has been partly caused by the lack of change in 
the method of financing and administrating schools, Egyutteles 
[Coexistence] Deputy Miklos Feher said at a press conference 
today. The state was not interested in schools being 
administrated by the community, especially those in areas with a 
large Hungarian minority, he said. 
  Executive Secretary of Egyutteles Alzbeta Dolnikova added 
that minorities were not sufficiently represented in school 
management. 
  Egyutteles Deputy Edita Bauerova pointed to the words of an 
unnamed Education Ministry representative who said, in the last 
electoral term, that "the decentralization of basic education in 
Slovakia had not yet been carried out because a large Hungarian 
minority lives there." 
  One solution, Bauerova said, was a proposal which the 
government had already looked at -- that the revenues which the 
Education Ministry created itself would not then have to be put 
into the state budget. Another possibility was to amend the tax 
law to allow physical persons to claim tax exemption for the 
cost of educating their children. 
  Bauerova also expressed dissatisfaction at parliament not 
having granted the CTV company a license for television 
broadcasting. She said she supported CTV because the company 
intended to develop regional broadcasting. The competition 
would help ensure that Slovaks were better informed, especially 
given that public corporation television was having financial 
problems. 
  Egyutteles representatives said they were waiting for the 
law 
on the media to be put forward, and intended to initiate a 
change in the positions of the Slovak Council for Radio and 
Television Broadcasting, the Slovak Television Council, and the 
Slovak Radio Council. 
  At its 27th session, parliament failed to approve the 
granting of a license to the CTV company for television 
broadcasting in the second circuit of Slovak Television. 
However, parliament charged the Radio and Television 
Broadcasting Council with putting forward a proposal for a new 
candidate for the license by the end of April.

  [Text] [Announcer] Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred 
Serreqi and his Bulgarian counterpart Stanislav Daskalov held a 
joint news conference today. Here is Sokol Balla: 
  [Balla] Both the Albanian and Bulgarian foreign ministers 
held a joint news conference today in a hall in the Palace of 
Congresses in Tirana. Albanian Minister Serreqi first spoke 
about the main questions that were the focus of bilateral talks, 
such as the crisis in former Yugoslavia, the situation in the 
region, the reciprocal information of both governments on 
reform, the process of European integration of both 
post-communist states, etc. 
  Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov stressed that 
we have once again rebuilt our present vision of relations and 
how to expand them by first defining their juridical basis so as 
to open the way to further economic cooperation. 
  At this conference they stressed that there are presently no 
outstanding problems between the two countries. Nevertheless, 
more frequent political contact is expected. Daskalov said that 
wonderful prospects lie ahead of us. 
  Asked about whether or not the Balkan countries will 
intervene in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia if it spreads 
to the south of the peninsula, the Bulgarian foreign minister 
gave a negative response; this, according to him and the 
position maintained by the Bulgarian Government, would 
complicate the situation. He also answered a question on the 
presence of Turkish or Greek soldiers in the UN forces in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. [not further specified] 
  Albanian Foreign Minister Serreqi answered the same question 
by stressing that we should overcome several prejudices related 
to the presence of Turkish or Russian [as heard] soldiers in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serreqi said that what is left is the hope 
that Blue Helmets of every nationality will play a peacekeeping 
role, always within the UN framework and under its flag. 
  Asked about the international peacekeeping presence in 
Kosova, the Bulgarian foreign minister answered that Bulgaria 
supports all peacekeeping initiatives that attempt to prevent 
the spread of the conflict to the south. However, Daskalov 
declared that, as far as an international presence in Kosova is 
concerned, we should first ask the Serbian party. 
  The Bulgarian foreign minister did not pronounce himself on 
the problem of Albanians in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] because, as he presented the 
argument, this is an internal affair of the Macedonian state. 
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Daskalov left our country today.

  [Text] The 21-year-old Fredi Muca has been added to the 
number of Albanians killed on the border. During 1993 and 1994 
the number of Albanians killed along the border with the 
Republic of the Former Yugoslavia amounts to 14 and eight have 
been injured; along the border with The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia [FYROM] one has been killed and three injured; and 
along the border the Republic of Greece we note the latest case, 
dated 22 March 1994, which resulted in one person killed. 
  Albanian official sources report that in the Greek village 
of 
Kostinec, 3 km into Greek territory, 21-year-old Fredi Abaz 
Muca, a resident of Bubullime village in Lushnje, was shot by an 
automatic rifle pointed at his chest. 
  The Albanian Helsinki Committee asks the Greek authorities 
to 
take the necessary measures to investigate the incident that 
occurred and eventually convict in a court of law the person who 
caused the crime, on the basis of Greek laws currently in effect. 
  The committee simultaneously requests that such cases be 
stopped and not repeated as they flagrantly violate human rights 
and create tension in the friendly relations that exist between 
the Greek and Albanian Republics.

<F P=106> [Osvath report: "Tibor Pongracz: It Would Be a Mistake To </F>
Stop Privatizations"] 
  [Text] It is not customary for the coalition parties to 
send messages to each other through the newspapers, Titular 
State Secretary Tibor Pongracz, chairman of the State Property 
Agency's [AVU] board of directors, told MAGYAR NEMZET in 
reaction to the statement of the Christian Democratic People's 
Party [KDNP] executive committee. According to this, 
privatizations should be suspended from 7 April until the new 
parliament is formed, the reason being, among other things, that 
the chances of supervision are further reduced during the 
election period. 
  For such a measure to be taken, or at least to deal with 
this 
proposal, talks should be started as a minimum, but Pongracz is 
not aware of any such talks at the moment. In his view, 
suspending privatizations would be a catastrophic mistake 
because, on one hand, this would completely frighten away 
foreign capital -- and it would hardly be possible to lure it 
back again -- and, on the other, it would also create 
immeasurable domestic political confusion and dissatisfaction. 
  It must not be forgotten, either, that even in the case of 
the left wing's advancement -- which is feared by many -- it 
would not be sensible to halt privatizations because both the 
Liberals and the Socialists are in favor of privatization, even 
if they have different views on the ways of implementing it. 
All the parties have returned to the notion of social market 
economy and they are emphasizing the small differences. 
Privatization is a good battle ground for them and the attacks 
can be concentrated on this area. However, it is strange, and 
politically unethical before the elections for a coalition 
partner to give the impressions that it has not actually been 
part of this at all, Pongracz stated.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bela Csepe, parliamentary group leader of </F>
the Christian Democratic People's Party, KDNP, by Janos A. 
Szilagyi; place and date not given: "The KDNP's Suggestion Is 
Not a Campaign Trick"] 
  [Text] Janos Szabo Hatvani, director of the State Property 
Agency [AVU], also participated in the 28 March session of the 
Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]. At the meeting the 
KDNP's concerns about privatization were discussed, and the 
party's latest suggestion that no privatization contracts should 
be made until the new parliament takes office was also mentioned. 
  [Szilagyi] The KDNP's latest suggestion regarding the change 
of ownership met with indignation in economic and financial 
circles. Why did the executive committee deem it necessary to 
suspend privatization? 
  [Csepe] The executive committee was aware of the fact that, 
being a party with a small parliamentary representation, the 
KDNP cannot have the necessary amount of say in the decisions 
and privatization deals would not be stopped after its call. 
The main reason for our initiative is that the Christian 
Democratic concerns should not be forgotten about before the 
elections and later, when the new government is set up. It is 
to be feared that during the weeks when the public is busy 
dealing with the elections, and when it is no longer possible to 
draw attention to the irregularities through raising questions 
in Parliament, further bad and irreparable decisions can be made. 
  [Szilagyi] According to the AVU director, the executive 
committee made a hasty statement that serves campaign purposes. 
  [Csepe] I refuse this most firmly. We have not now begun to 
deal with this issue to win over the voters. The KDNP's current 
proposal is a reformulation of our former criticism. 
  [Szilagyi] Have you prepared any analyses about what effects 
your initiative can have on the fate of enterprises awaiting 
privatization that are on the brink of bankruptcy, and how the 
proposal will affect Hungary's foreign image? 
  [Csepe] The executive committee's statement was based on the 
KDNP's former privatization investigations and analytical 
assessments. My personal view is that it is useful to implement 
this proposal, with the provision that it should not be applied 
in those cases where the suspension would be damaging from a 
financial or economic point of view. 
  [Szilagyi] According to our information, many KDNP members 
also had a negative view on this proposal. Many of them 
consider it damaging and unfavorable for the party's image. Did 
you coordinate this proposal with the party's other leading 
bodies and its parliamentary group? 
  [Csepe] We did not widely discuss the proposal, this was a 
decision of the executive committee in its own sphere of 
authority. I do not think that it will become a source of 
tension in the party.

Wooden Trojan Horse"] 
  [Text] Parliamentary Deputy Izabella B. Kiraly is the 
chairwoman of the Hungarian Interest Party [MEP], founded on 7 
September 1993. Her young party -- which characterizes itself 
as a national, conservative, Christian, democratic, and 
pragmatic party -- differs from Istvan Csurka's Hungarian 
Justice and Life Party [MIEP] not only through the one letter in 
their acronym but also because, unlike the MIEP, the MEP does 
not think in terms of restoring St. Stephen's Hungary, but it 
regards the beginning of a Hungarian presence of a much older 
time. The MEP does not relate to the Jews' identity problems, 
and it supports the just efforts of the international Gypsy king 
to create, like the Jews, their own homeland, Romanistan, in the 
Danube Delta. 
  [Danyi] When did you leave the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF]? 
  [Kiraly] I do not remember exactly. 
  [Danyi] When did you first feel that that was the end 
regarding the MDF? 
  [Kiraly] I already suspected for a considerable time that 
the MDF was a big wooden Trojan horse, in other words, it no 
longer spoke about the things that it used to at the beginning, 
and it was not carrying out its promises. The great protest of 
the government forces came in the wake of the Trianon Meeting 
held on 4 June 1993 and my parliamentary speech on the 
Hungarian-Ukrainian basic treaty, in which I urged a peaceful 
reunification of the Carpathian Basin. Then I fell victim to 
ethnic cleansing. I also know that these events can be traced 
back to the demonstration held in Kossuth Square on 23 October 
1992, in which President Arpad Goncz was not allowed to deliver 
his speech, a demonstration at which I was not present because I 
was delivering a speech at Corvinter. 
  [Danyi] How did you get into contact with the young people 
called fascists in the "Evening Balance" program on Hungarian 
Television? 
  [Kiraly] These youngsters came to me around 26 October 1992 
to protest against this label. 
  [Danyi] You are slowly turning into the Hungarian skinheads' 
defending matron? Do you accept this role with pride? 
  [Kiraly] The situation is not as complex as it looks. This 
labelling is aimed at discrediting us politically. When the 
civilized West was burning witches, our King Kalman Konyves said 
the following: "There are no witches!" Now I say the same: 
There are no skinheads. 
  [Danyi] But there are skinheads. 
  [Kiraly] There were women in Kalman Konyves's time who 
claimed to be witches. Do you understand? They could not be 
witches; at most, they were healing soothsayers. In my opinion, 
there are unsolved problems. For example, the degenerate 
actions in Rostock drew my attention to the fact that, for 
years, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] had failed 
to recognize that its liberal immigration policy had not been 
serving the interests of the German people. They actually 
provoked the youngsters' brutal acts. I generally regard the 
skinheads' movement as some kind of self- justice to 
counterbalance an administration of justice that does not work 
adequately. The approach that there can only government justice 
and right is unacceptable. 
  [Danyi] In your opinion, how many skinheads are there in 
Hungary today? 
  [Kiraly] Look, we can speak about such a movement, but we 
should also examine whom we can call skinheads. If a shaven 
head is the basic criterion, then Matyas Rakosi, Gyorgy Gado, 
and Janos Kis can also be listed as skinheads. One should not 
start from the outside appearance, because there are youngsters 
who have bald heads and leather jackets with boots merely 
because of fashion. Instead, one should argue with their ideas. 
Does anyone know what these people think about refugees and 
immigration? The way I see it, with their appearance, these 
youngsters protest against the old regime. They are justified in 
wondering why the red star is still there on top of Szabadsag 
Square in Budapest. 
  [Danyi] Let me repeat my question: What is the approximate 
number of Hungarian skinheads? 
  [Kiraly] I know of many organizations, but they can no 
longer be regarded as independent. I think that there are a lot 
of youngsters with national feelings in this country both in the 
Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP] and the MIEP, but there 
are relatively few of them in an organized framework. At the 
same time, it is a fact that, out of the 19 founders of the MEP, 
there were six bald youngsters. It is outrageous how little the 
police know about these people; the police simply have no real 
information about them. I do not know how their undercover 
people work. This is why I was surprised at the exaggerated 
police supervision of the festivities on 15 March. 
  [Danyi] What about the more than 100 skinheads arrested in 
Szeged on the eve of our national day? 
  [Kiraly] I can imagine that, because the buses carrying 
people from Miskolc and Eger to the meeting in Budapest on 15 
March were halted and the passengers were checked and frisked 
for almost two hours. There is no need for such preventative 
measures in a democracy. 
  [Danyi] Among others, you have also been invited to Moscow 
by Zhirinovskiy. Have you accepted the invitation? 
  [Kiraly] Yes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Janos Latorcai, industry and trade minister </F>
and a member of the Christian Democratic People's Party, by 
Dezso Pinter; place and date not given: "I Made the Necessary 
Step at the Right Time"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Pinter] According to a 
leading official of the European Union, it is difficult to 
imagine Hungary's membership and development without a strong 
middle class. What are your views on the chances of this 
fledgling stratum of society? 
  [Latorcai] Well-functioning democracies and economies base 
themselves on the bourgeoisie, and the middle class is an 
essential part of this. Our conditions are still confused, we 
cannot yet talk about an organized market economy, and the 
middle classes are still missing. However, we can already see 
how and where they will be established. One way of establishing 
them is through the economic policy creating more opportunity 
for domestic entrepreneurs. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] A strong middle class cannot exist without a 
proprietor group that is becoming richer and more efficient. In 
your view, does a group like this exist in Hungary? 
  [Latorcai] Yes, it does. To make it bigger, loans have been 
and still are needed because the personal savings have proved to 
be too small. In spite of all this, partly as a result of the 
role of foreign capital, some 35 percent of Hungarian industry 
is in private ownership and, in 1993, this 35 percent produced 
50 percent of the output. This is important and encouraging 
data when it comes to formulating the ideas of the Christian 
Democratic People's Party [KDNP] aimed at economic growth. 
  [Pinter] What is the essence of these ideas? 
  [Latorcai] First of all, the stimulation of enterprises. We 
would particularly like to continue and to expand the support 
for small- and medium-size enterprises. One method of this 
would be a new regulation of tax and credit policy and the 
expansion of help for new enterprises. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] In this program, which components criticize the 
current economic policy? 
  [Latorcai] A change of philosophy is most important in our 
view. It should be the economy, rather than the budget, that 
determines the situation of the country and, as far as possible, 
which also determines the budget. Therefore, it is necessary to 
prepare a new regulation of state finances. In the interest of 
a more proportionate share of the burdens, we want to move from 
an income-type taxation toward a consumption-type taxation; 
taxing the accumulated large assets and, in personal taxation, 
giving greater weight to family taxation are unavoidable. And 
while we are talking about the criticism of the current 
practice: A change of direction has to be implemented in 
economic policy that will give greater scope to the state's role 
to the extent that is necessary, but not work against the market 
processes. A lasting industrial growth is impossible without 
developing its dynamic branches, therefore, we want to improve 
the investment conditions, we are planning to change the 
amortization system, we would like to give tax allowances for 
investments, and we would expand the preferential loan packages. 
It is essential to draw up a nationwide program of 
infrastructure development because this development creates an 
additional demand in the economy, creates work opportunities, 
and boosts the domestic market. In privatization, we want to 
extend the proprietor groups in society, to ensure that the 
privatization of the state assets is done in a planned, 
controllable, and visible way. The revenues from privatization 
should not be used to restore the short-term budget balance 
because these amounts are needed in the reorganization of the 
economy, industry, or the given company. We find it necessary 
to increase the involvement of foreign working capital. 
  [Pinter] Are you not afraid that even your own voters will 
accuse you of selling off the country? Such comments cannot 
only be heard from the supporters of parties that are said to be 
extremists. 
  [Latorcai] I know about this, I can hear it, and I am 
sufficiently annoyed about it. My reply is that 10 to 12 
percent of the national assets are in question. In the vast 
majority of privatizations and investments with foreign capital, 
technologies, and factory and labor managements that are more 
modern than the domestic ones have been implemented, and they 
have helped our domestic products gain access to the markets of 
developed countries. The favorable influence the joint ventures 
have on their suppliers when they insist on deadlines and 
regular good quality is worth noticing. Having said all this, I 
must say that, in the interest of increasing the domestic 
entrepreneurial willingness, the KDNP does not want to 
differentiate between domestic and foreign investments. This is 
one of the reasons it is important to involve a large proportion 
of domestic savings in the economy. A better offer of credits 
and bank privatization implemented while a modern banking system 
is established is a short step away from this. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] You are also probably familiar with the view that 
the KDNP's current behavior is like a political conjurer's trick 
because the party is showing a striking flexibility regarding 
its participation in a coalition after the elections. Do these 
views offend you? 
  [Latorcai] The KDNP has become one of the most important 
factors in Hungarian politics, and it would be strange if its 
behavior was not surrounded by speculations. The KDNP will 
certainly not govern together with forces that do not accept the 
civilized value system that has been established in Europe. In 
the interest of raising the nation, the KDNP lays great emphasis 
on creating consensus. I agree with this, and as an economic 
expert, I know that those who create and implement the economic 
policy that is our future will need an as broad as possible 
consensus. Since the KDNP has many values, we can certainly 
assess the values of other parties, too. We can determine how 
suitable these values, together, are for serving the nation. To 
remain in my professional area, the KDNP certainly will not join 
a partner that lets inflation loose, increases unemployment, and 
further increases the country's indebtedness, because these 
kinds of conditions would make the futures of our children and 
even our grandchildren uncertain. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Judit Kozma report: "Is the Modest Industrial Growth </F>
Continuing?"] 
  [Text] Modest signs of growth that are proving to be 
lasting appeared in certain branches of industry in 1993, an 
analysis of the Industry and Trade Ministry claims. The 
Ministry believes even a 4- to 5-percent growth possible in 
1994, but the experts of the Economic Research Inc. [GKI] only 
expect 2 to 3 percent at the most. 
  In 1993, industrial output exceeded the 1992 level by 4 
percent, the Central Statistical Office's report says. Within 
this, the output of manufacturing industry increased by 3.3 
percent, mining by 1 percent, while 2.2 percent less was 
produced in electric energy, gas, heating, and water supplies 
than a year before. Within manufacturing, the output of 
metallurgy and metal processing increased by 14 percent and the 
10.3 percent increase in engineering industry was also 
significant. Within this, the output of office machines and 
computers increased by more than two and a half fold and the 
production of public vehicles increased by about one-third. 
  At the same time, sales did not keep pace with the increased 
production, they exceeded the 1992 level by 2.9 percent. This 
mostly came from the growth of domestic sales because exports 
only increased by 0.2 percent compared to the year before. The 
exports of textiles, and leather and fur products were 
exceptions where, mainly as a result of work performed under 
commission agreements, exports increased by 11.9 percent. The 
chemical industry also achieved a relatively large export growth 
with 6.1 percent. At the same time, engineering industry mainly 
produced for the domestic market. For example, public vehicle 
production increased its sales by some 87 percent and the sales 
of light sources and lighting equipment increased one and a half 
times. 
  As we learned it from various sources, the Industry Ministry 
expects the continuation of the favorable tendencies of 1993, 
perhaps as much as a 4 to 5 percent growth. The experts of the 
Economic Research Inc. predict a somewhat lower growth, namely 2 
to 3 percent. They said that this is based on the presumption 
that those industrial branches that started to grow in 1993 will 
continue to develop in 1994. On one hand, they are predicting a 
6 to 7 percent growth of national invesetments, which means a 
good market for the enterprises interested in this area. On the 
other hand, the apparent upswing in Western Europe increases the 
export possibilities. It is a different matter that the 5 to 6 
percent export growth forecast by the government is considered 
to be excessive by economic researchers. The export 
possibilities are hampered by the decrease of work performed 
under commission agreements because the low Ukrainian, Slovak, 
Romanian, and Polish wages are now strong competitors of the low 
Hungarian wages. However, forint devaluations can improve the 
export positions. The GKI expects a 17 percent devaluation 
throughout the year, some of which has already been implemented. 
Further devaluations might give an impetus to exports after the 
elections, however, according to their forecast, all in all, 
this will only be enough to keep exports on the 1993 level. 
Therefore, although at different levels in the various branches 
of industry, industrial output will also continue to grow in 
1994.

  [Text] The Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI] held a news 
conference at the House of Culture of the Ministry of Interior 
today with the participation of SRI Director Virgil Magureanu 
and Nicolae Ulieru, head of the SRI Press Bureau. More than 200 
journalists, representatives of the main newspapers in Bucharest 
and the provinces, photojournalists, and journalists from radio 
and television stations, including from private stations, were 
present in the hall, our correspondent Dragos Ciocarlan reports. 
  At the beginning of the news conference, SRI Director Virgil 
Magureanu referred to several aspects of the activity of the 
institution he is heading in the period since the previous news 
conference last November. He pointed out the positive changes 
that have occurred in the institution's image, after the 
election of the SRI director by the vote in parliament and after 
the important adjustments made in the regional and central 
leadership of the institution, which is the third stage of SRI's 
restructuring. Virgil Magureanu considered the setting up of 
the parliamentary control commission of the SRI activity as a 
new stage in his institution's relationship with the parliament 
and the public at large. 
  Among the problems currently facing the SRI, Magureanu 
referred to personnel policies. Regarding the SRI report on the 
December 1989 events, a report which he forwarded at the 
beginning of this year to the parliamentary commission 
investigating those events, Magureanu said that the release of 
this report to the press will depend on the commission's 
president, Valentin Gabrielescu. 
  Regarding the activity carried out by the SRI in recent 
months, Magureanu said that, despite certain sensationalist 
nuances presented in the press, it was assessed as, quote, a 
normal activity, which does not necessarily mean a routine one, 
end quote. 
  Magureanu then answered the many questions put by the 
journalists.

<F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "The Left Has Fallen Into Ion </F>
Iliescu's Subtle Trap"] 
  [Text] At his news conference held at the end of last 
week, Presidency Spokesman Traian Chebeleu announced the signing 
by Ion Iliescu of a decree pardoning certain individuals. Among 
these "individuals" were the candidate members of the Political 
Executive Committee (PEC) [of the former Romanian Communist 
Party, PCR] who were sentenced to jail terms after the December 
1989 events. The specification "candidate PEC members" was 
necessary to dispel the impression that the decree refers to all 
participants in the famous PEC meeting of 17 December 1989. The 
high presidential goodwill only touched a part of those who 
later had to pay for their presence at that meeting. The full 
PEC members were not pardoned, which has led to their 
complaining about it to the Council of Europe in a letter 
published on page 3 of this issue of our daily. The pardoning 
of part of those sentenced after December 1989 has caused great 
enthusiasm within the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM], the 
Greater Romania Party [PRM], the Romanian National Unity Party 
[PUNR], and even the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. 
Recently, the left has insistently demanded the release of the 
former PEC members. The satisfaction with which the 
presidential decree was received resides in the belief that Ion 
Iliescu has had to give in. Is this belief justified? If we 
read only part of the decree, the answer is positive. However, 
if we read the full text, the satisfaction of the PRM, the PSM, 
the PUNR, and the conservative group within the PDSR is not all 
that justified, for the simple reason that, along with the 
former PEC candidate members, eight Hungarian ethnics involved 
in the murders committed at Zetea and Dealu in December 1989 
were also pardoned. The latter were sentenced in 1990 and 1991 
for first degree murder, after killing several Romanian 
militiamen on 22 December 1989. The nationalist-communist 
forces, represented by the PRM, the PSM, the PUNR, and part of 
the PDSR, received with great satisfaction the sentences 
pronounced against the Hungarian ethnics. The Democratic Union 
of Hungarians in Romania [UDMR] immediately protested and never 
ceased to do so since then on. It complained to various 
European bodies, including the Council of Europe. The PRM, the 
PSM, the PUNR, and part of the PDSR rose against the UDMR's 
action. In the press and Parliament, the nationalist-communist 
leaders termed the UDMR protest as a destabilizing action and 
asked the institutions of the power, headed by the presidency, 
not to give in to what they called Hungarian blackmail. The 
international pressure to pardon the eight Hungarians became 
increasingly greater with each passing day. It was mainly the 
Council of Europe that took up the issue of their pardoning. 
One of the points of the inspection by the two Council of 
Europe rapporteurs [Friedrich Koenig and Gunnar Jansson], due to 
start today, is whether Romania released the eight Hungarians. 
Ion Iliescu was thus confronted with a dilemma. By keeping the 
eight Council of Europe proteges in jail, he risked to incur 
great international wrath. By releasing them, he risked the 
fury of his left-wing allies. He solved this dilemma in the 
well-known Ion Iliescu style, namely through a politically 
well-thought maneuver. For the president, the main thing was to 
comply with the Council of Europe's requirement. However, this 
should be done in such a way as to not upset the 
nationalist-communist leaders too much. Therefore, he added the 
PEC candidate members to the list of the pardoned people. In 
that way, the president tried to reduce to the maximum the 
negative impact that the pardoning of the eight Hungarian 
ethnics was bound to produce among the left. One might say that 
his former party-state colleagues were pardoned thanks to the 
eight Hungarians. If it had not been for this complicated 
problem, it is more than certain that Ion Iliescu would not have 
even thought of freeing those who remained bosses, while he was 
demoted to a mere director of a publishing house. One cannot 
say that the president did not act cleverly. The PSM, the PRM, 
the PUNR, and part of the PDSR overlooked the pardoning of the 
eight Hungarian ethnics. Their entire attention concentrated on 
the release of the former PEC candidate members. It is easy to 
imagine what a hullabaloo would have been if the pardon had only 
envisaged the Hungarians. The president would have incurred the 
wrath of his allies. Consequently, the pardoning of the former 
PEC candidate members is not a sign of weakness from Ion Iliescu 
vis-a-vis the left of our political landscape. It should rather 
be considered as a subtle trap that the president has set for 
the PRM, the PSM, the PUNR, and part of the PDSR. Therefore, a 
more careful examination of the situation reveals that these 
political forces have no reason to be enthusiastic about the 
recent decree signed by Ion Iliescu.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mircea Ionescu Quintus, president of the </F>
National Liberal Party, by Andrei Costa; place and date not 
given: "The Unification of the Liberal Movement Is a Must for 
Romania"] 
  [Excerpts] [Costa] Mr. President, when did you first get 
come into contact with the liberal movement? 
  [Quintus] In April 1936, when I was still a student. My 
father, who died shortly before that date, had been the chairman 
of the liberal organization in Prahova County. [passage 
omitted] My actual involvement took place at the end of 1945, 
with the Soviet troops still in the country. I and a group of 
colleagues and friends decided to join the National Liberal 
Party [PNL] "Bratianu." We set up a very strong youth 
organization and I was elected its chairman. Therefore, I 
occupied this post from the end of 1945 until the spring of 
1947, when the political parties were outlawed. I was also a 
member of the Liberal Youth Central Committee, where I became 
acquainted with a part of the present leadership of the party. 
Some of my former colleagues are no longer alive. 
  [Costa] Did you suffer political persecution in the period 
of communist dictatorship? 
  [Quintus] Of course, I was lucky to suffer less than the 
others, since I remained in the Collegium of Lawyers, whose 
chairman was a man with whom I did military service and who 
overlooked my political past. [passage omitted] Nevertheless, 
I was once briefly arrested in 1945 and then, for a longer time 
in 1952, when I was sent to the Canal [the first Danube-Black 
Sea Canal project, where political prisoners were sent to do 
hard labor] until 1954, because of my former position in the 
liberal youth movement. Likewise, in 1956 and 1957 I was 
submitted to tough interrogations by the Securitate. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Costa] What are the present prospects of the liberal trend 
at the international level? 
  [Quintus] I believe that the strongest liberal movement 
right now is in Japan. [passage omitted] Without trying to 
show local patriotism, I would say that some of the strongest 
liberal parties -- I am sorry to have to use the plural here -- 
are in Romania. Nowhere in the countries with liberal parties is 
the liberal governing alternative as possible as in our country, 
if we were to manage to achieve the most important thing for the 
country, namely the unification of the liberal movement. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Costa] With what liberal parties abroad does the PNL 
maintain relations of cooperation? 
  [Quintus] We are cooperating with various parties of a 
liberal orientation from Bulgaria, Hungary, Germany, 
Switzerland, and Belgium. In Sweden, there is also a liberal 
party with which we have been in touch. However, this 
cooperation has been pretty timid, since we have to pay more 
attention to PNL internal problems and stability. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Costa] Regarding the local public administration, how do 
the PNL representatives in the territory act to solve problems 
in the spheres they are in charge of? Please tell us how do you 
cooperate with the other opposition parties in this respect. 
  [Quintus] Personally, I know the situation in many counties, 
where our councillors cooperate perfectly well with the 
councillors of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) 
[PD(FSN]) and the Democratic Convention [CDR]. I would like to 
point out that the letters of intent we have recently signed 
with the PD(FSN) and the Civic Alliance Party [PAC] proved to be 
very inspired and were very well received in the territory, 
where, I repeat, there is a perfect cooperation among us. This 
cooperation strives hard to thwart the constant attempts of the 
Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] to also lay hold of the 
power in the local administration, where the CDR and PD(FSN) 
have scored very good results in the local elections. This 
common front is necessary to thwart this dangerous intention of 
those in power. 
  [Costa] If it were given a mandate to govern the country, 
under what conditions would the PNL accept it? 
  [Quintus] This is a hypothetical question, which I will 
consequently treat as such. First of all, the liberals could 
only assume the responsibility of government if they were united 
in a single large party and not in the mess they are right now. 
For the coming months, up to a year for now, I believe that the 
country can only be ruled by a coalition of parties that can put 
together a parliamentary majority. As for us, the PNL has a 
single representative in Parliament, namely Mr. Caius Dragomir, 
who, if he is appointed ambassador abroad, will have to give up 
his post as senator and the quality member of our party. A 
party that has no parliamentary support cannot fulfill its 
program in government. However, I believe that, in the current 
circumstances, only a coalition between the opposition and one 
of the important forces of the power can assume such a 
responsibility. If, by some absurdity, I were to be given the 
mandate to govern, I would refuse it because it would be 
preposterous for a party that is not even represented in 
Parliament to think of the possibility of governing. However, I 
repeat, even if we were represented in Parliament, only a 
coalition of powerful forces could run public affairs in the 
current very difficult economic and social conditions of the 
country and try to implement the reform and revitalize our 
production and economy. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Amendments to the Constitutional Law adopted at the </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly session in Sarajevo on 30 March; 
read by Constitutional Commission member Kasim Begic -- live] 
  [Text] The commission has decided to adopt the amendments 
that apply to the (?original) text. Article 1, Paragraph 2 
should include the words: possible changes. So, (?this is) a 
decision on possible changes. 
  Moreover, Article 4 will have a new paragraph, which reads: 
The Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, reshuffled 
according to the Constitution of the Federation, will perform 
the duties of the Government of the Federation. 
  Article 5, instead of the old paragraph 2, which is being 
nullified, contains a new paragraph: The competences of the 
Federation as determined by the Constitution of the Federation 
that refer to the international status [subjektivitet] and 
territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina will 
be exercised after the completion of the peace process for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  You have in the meantime received these changes to the 
original text, in other words, the amended text. 
  In addition, the commission proposes that Article 5 be 
followed by a new Article 6 that should read: In Article 9 of 
the Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the word 
Muslim is replaced with the word Bosniak. 
  The commission did not accept other amendments because some 
of them are not in the domain of constitutional matters. Some 
other amendments presented in the discussion here are not in 
line with the Washington Agreement, nor in line with the 
decision adopted by the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina last 
night, which ratified the Washington Agreement. Some amendments 
are simply not correct. Therefore, they are not a result of the 
text of the Constitutional Law, but of a lack of understanding. 
For instance, regarding the name of the federation, the 
Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot include the words: the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Regarding the amendments proposed by Mr. Ceman, the 
amendment 
that referred to a new paragraph in Article 2, the 
Constitutional Commission proposes that this be presented in the 
form of a statement by the Assembly, and that the text of the 
Constitutional Law not be changed, as this would open the 
question of whether the text of the Constitutional Law and the 
Washington Agreement are complementary. 
  Therefore, regarding the presented amendments, you now have 
in the edited text all the amendments that have been adopted by 
the Constitutional Commission, except the new Article 6. The 
existing, old Article 6 is now to become Article 7. 
  Finally, the Constitutional Commission is recommending to 
the 
deputies not to hold a discussion on the proposed Constitutional 
Law for two reasons. First, there has already been time to 
discuss it and the deputies, and the Presidency and the 
Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina have already 
expressed their views on it. The other reason is that every new 
amendment would require additional assessment by the 
Constitutional Commission. In this way we would only prolong 
what we are all waiting for, I hope, namely the session of the 
constituent assembly. 
  Therefore, I ask the deputies to ratify, as stated here, the 
proposed Constitutional Law, as a supplement to the Constitution 
of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Bosnia-Herzegovina Vice President Ejup Ganic: </F>
"The End of an Aristocratic Play"] 
  [Text] What does the Pax Americana that has been signed in 
Washington, the capital of European diplomacy, bring to us? In 
addition to that, the visit of British Prime Minister Major, and 
his view expressed in the talks that the first principle of the 
London conference (forcefully taken territories are not to be 
recognized), at which he was presiding, and the statement to a 
CCN [as published, probably CNN] journalist after the meeting, 
that pressure ought to be exerted on Serbs, is what makes the 
recent days politically harmonized. 
  The made-in-America beginning of peace in Bosnia is bringing 
about currently the most important thing -- a chance for peace. 
  The United States is neither a country of sentiment, nor of 
charity, nor of the generous Slav soul, and even less of the 
self-loving, rigid, frustrated diplomats of the former great 
powers, who tried to cure their spinster-like neuroses by 
dealing with Bosnia. The United States, which fortunately did 
not turn proletarian, has simplified the Bosnian crisis, 
breaking it down to its tiniest components, and rewound the 
entire film back to its beginning. And the beginning of 
everything was the Serbian aggression, in those April days of 
1992, when the Serbian army massively set off across the Drina 
River, following the example of great Soviet tank offensives in 
World War II. In only 10 or so days, by fire and sword, with 
streams of blood and incredible crimes, that army took hold of 
Bosanski Brod, Zvornik, Foca, Visegrad.... 
  At the very beginning the Americans unmistakably 
distinguished between the good guys and the bad guys. What 
happened later in Bosnia-Herzegovina, under the rule of European 
mediation, is well known. Americans, the masters of 
simplification, have gone much further: The good guys will live 
together, while the bad guys may join the good guys, but the war 
criminals must be brought to justice. I ask the readers not to 
insist on subtleties, or details, of all those Balkan mysticisms 
by which Belgrade has so skillfully befogged the war in Bosnia. 
Milosevic wanted to turn his classic aggression into a civil 
war, and to misrepresent all his conquests as though they were 
done in self-defense.... 
  Therefore, the paper that was signed in Washington is a 
result of the systematized chronology, and of the determination 
that the world should finally start dealing with things the way 
that Europe should have dealt with them as early as April and 
May 1992. The Washington agreement means also the end of 
diplomacy's being an aristocratic play. Lord Carrington, Lord 
Owen, and citizen Stoltenberg made a mistake while cribbing 
their exam-paper in mathematics, and all the time they believed 
they were right, until they themselves fell victims to their 
delusion. They mixed up apples and pears, that is, the 
aggression and the legitimate resistance of a sovereign country. 
The Washington initiative has definitely pensioned them off. 
  Bosnia-Herzegovina, just like the phoenix, is slowly and 
with 
difficulty rising from its ashes. The new interior arrangement 
of Bosnia is just being designed. The sooner the Serbs join the 
negotiations and give back what they seized, the more 
comfortable their future home will be for them. 
  But let us not fool ourselves that the war is over just 
because the peace pipe was so joyfully smoked on Capitol Hill. 
If Sarajevo is no longer so savagely shelled, while Bihac, 
Maglaj, and Olovo still are, that does not mean we should be 
satisfied that the war, perhaps even a more fierce one, has 
moved into the interior of the country. 
  There will be no peace in Bosnia without peace in its most 
distant hamlet. There will be no peace in Bosnia unless all 
those who were expelled and displaced in the process of ethnic 
cleansing (read: genocide) return to their homes. For that 
reason I believe that the Washington agreement is but a first 
step toward a just solution. 
  Because we are wiser, given the experience of one war, and 
more cautious, given the prospect of peace.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 29 Mar (TANJUG) -- President of the Srpska 
republic Radovan Karadzic received a delegation of the Russian 
parliament led by Sergey Baburin in Pale today. Following the 
meeting, Karadzic stated that the Russian parliamentarians' 
visit was important for many reasons. He recalled that Russia 
was involved in the adoption of all resolutions on the Bosnian 
crisis and that Russian soldiers are present in this area. Asked 
whether they discussed the possibility of dispatching fresh 
Russian troops to Bosnia, president Karadzic said the Serb side 
is making steps in that direction, in order to act as a 
counterbalance to soldiers from other countries. The Russian 
parliamentarians visited members of the Russian UN Protection 
Force battalion deployed in Grbavica.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jovan Lakicevic] </F>
  [Text] The recent convention of a group of Sarajevo Serbs 
who expressed loyalty to Alija Izetbegovic and supported his 
concept of a unitarian Bosnia under Muslim domination, is a 
matter of choice for the individuals who gathered there. 
However, this has nothing to do with the already expressed 
legitimate will of the Serbian people in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Here is a commentary by Jovan Lakicevic: 
  [Lakicevic] The Sarajevo political circus, stage-managed by 
some kind of a Serbian Citizens' or Serbian Consultative Council 
under the auspices of Alija Izetbegovic and the vigilant eye of 
U.S. Envoy Charles Redman, is one of those events that 
inevitably causes feelings of shame and resignation among decent 
people. This is so primarily because of the awareness of the 
kind of humiliation some of our compatriots in Sarajevo are 
prepared to accept in order to accomplish their extremely banal, 
petty, and personal ambitions. 
  Their decision to live in the Muslim part of Sarajevo is 
their own choice, and it was therefore not at all necessary to 
raise it to the level of an improvised political meeting and 
some kind of political proclamation that support Alija's idea of 
a unitarian Bosnia under Islamic domination. However, the 
meeting of a group of Sarajevo Serbs, who, as they themselves 
said, hold prominent posts in cultural, economic, political, 
humanitarian, (?business) and other organizations, with the 
unconcealed illusion that they will retain these with this 
action, has gone one step further. These Serbs did not hesitate 
to ask Izetbegovic and the United States to scrap the Srpska 
republic for the sake of unitarian Bosnia, and demand trials for 
their compatriots for having committed war crimes. 
  Regarding the first demand, they have obviously overlooked 
the fact that 90 percent of Serbs in Bosnia hold a different 
view and that they have expressed their view on two occasions. 
First, they voted in favor of the program of the Serbian 
Democratic Party, and then, with the same percentage, to stay in 
the former and future Yugoslavia. 
  Regarding war criminals, it appears that these concealed and 
newly discovered fans of Alija's sovereign Bosnia, who are 
susceptible to amnesia, completely overlooked the fact that the 
most serious crimes in Sarajevo have actually been committed by 
Alija's former proteges: Juka Prazina, Caca, and others, and 
that they have been liquidated by Izetbegovic's camarilla so 
that the International Court for War Crimes in The Hague could 
not one day lay its hands on the greatest monsters of the 
Sarajevo horror, who incidentally were not Serbs, but Muslims. 
  The aforementioned Sarajevo Serbs, who hastily gathered 
themselves in the Citizens Council and expressed loyalty to 
Izetbegovic's leadership, appear not to have learned anything 
from the experience of the Zagreb Serbian People's Party, a 
similar party in form and function. This so-called Serbian 
party of Milan Djukic's at one time played the role of folklore 
detachment to the vociferous young Croatian democracy, but when 
it had finished its sad, subservient role, Tudjman dismissed it 
completely. This appears to be the inevitable fate of all 
volunteer servants who are prepared to betray the interests of 
their people for personal gain. 
  Those who were in a position to see it on television saw 
that 
the so-called Serb convention in Sarajevo was also attended by a 
former top-ranking member of the League of Communists of Serbia, 
Zarko Papic. Also attending was Dr. Ivan Djuric, who was 
brought for this occasion from Paris and is otherwise known as 
someone suitable for all anti-Serbian actions anywhere from 
Belgrade to the capital city of France. Those who were not 
present but were dying to be there were the representatives of 
the Citizens Association of Serbia, the Independent Trade 
Unions, the Belgrade Club of Independent Intellectuals, the 
Center for Anti-War Action, the Fund for Human Rights, the 
Helsinki Parliament of Citizens, Women in Black, the European 
Movement, and other similar quasi peace-loving organizations 
from Belgrade, whose number is almost identical to the number of 
their members. 
  They were not there because UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
did not secure a plane for them to fly from Belgrade to 
Sarajevo. The president of the Serbian Renewal Movement did not 
go there either, even though he wanted to. He sent a letter to 
the organizers of the Serbian self-humiliation in Sarajevo, 
criticizing UNPROFOR for not meeting their wishes, unlike the 
wishes of those of who commanded the destruction of Sarajevo, 
which it had met on so many occasions in the past. 
  Things appear to be somewhat more complicated than it 
appeared to those nervous, impatient, and not-to-be passengers 
to Sarajevo. UNPROFOR people, that is, the political circles of 
the Western alliance, obviously correctly assessed that their 
trip to Sarajevo to serve Izetbegovic and Silajdzic would be a 
causal motive for their new political disgrace at home in 
Belgrade. They therefore needed to be protected from this, 
because all these pacifist organizations that used all available 
means, including those coming from abroad, to fight for peace 
and brotherhood and unity at a time when Serbs in Bosnia and 
Krajina were literally forced to take arms and protect their 
basic human and civil rights and the right to life, have not 
finished playing the role given to them by their inspirers and 
founders on the Serbian political scene. 
  One should therefore not be angry with UNPROFOR, because 
people in UNPROFOR, or rather, the people behind UNPROFOR, 
actually thought about their political future when the 
organizations were not. 
  Regarding the organizers of the aforementioned convention of 
Serbs in Sarajevo, they should simply be left to their own fate, 
or rather, the choice they themselves have made. This really has 
nothing to do with the Serbian people in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and their already expressed will and 
determination.

  [Text] Today Mustafa Efendija Ceric, reis ul ulema of the 
Islamic community of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
received Lieutenant General Ante Roso, commander of the Croatian 
Defense Council [HVO] Headquarters. The reception was also 
attended by Army General Rasim Delic, supreme commander of the 
Chief of Staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Armed Forces, and Naib 
Ul Reus Ismet Efendija Spahic. 
  During the long conversation, Reis Ul Ulema Mustafa Efendija 
Ceric supported all the efforts aimed at a military and 
political agreement between the Bosniak and Croatian peoples, 
and stressed that these two peoples are not two sides as they 
have only one homeland, Bosnia-Herzegovina. Their common fate 
is to fight a war for peace and to fight in peace for the 
defense of their own dignity. He stressed that the 1,000-year 
fate of Bosnia was its multicultural character, and that this 
feature was the only basis for the world and its existence. The 
reis ul ulema confirmed that the Islamic community would do all 
it could to help heal the wounds inflicted by the aggression 
upon Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has caused grievous losses to the 
Bosniak people. 
  Expressing his personal conviction as a believer that the 
Islamic community in Bosnia-Herzegovina and its leaders would 
offer help in the healing of the wounds caused by the war, 
Lieutenant General Ante Roso particularly stressed that he had 
come to Sarajevo because he was convinced that everything should 
be done to achieve this end. Saying that the establishment of a 
firm and lasting peace is a difficult task that is beyond the 
powers of any one man, Roso stressed his conviction that this 
could be done through joint efforts.

<F P=106> [Report by Fahrudin Becic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Text] The defenders of Gorazde are fighting the most 
decisive battle since the beginning of the aggression. [Words 
indistinct] tens of thousands of the most destructible 
projectiles are landing on all parts of the free territory and 
on our positions, villages, and town streets. There was not a 
single quiet moment last night or this morning. Immediately 
after midnight, after unprecedented artillery preparations, 
exceptionally strong infantry attacks were launched in several 
locations. They were repelled, but strong Chetnik forces are 
attacking again. 
  Heavy combat is currently taking place in the Praca valley, 
near the village of Zemegresi. The ground is trembling on the 
entire right bank of the Drina River. The situation is the same 
in the [names indistinct] regions. 
  According to the latest reports, the fresh Chetnik troops 
and 
the regular army of the so-called Yugoslavia are stationed 
somewhere between Uzice and Visegrad and Pljevlja and Cajnice. 
Strong Chetnik formations have arrived in the Foca region from 
the Herzegovina Corps. 
  There are some 500 artillery pieces pointing toward Gorazde. 
Mighty armored-mechanized forces are moving toward the town, but 
the defenders are making up for the lack of hardware with 
unprecedented courage. Around 0900 [700 GMT], the enemy stepped 
up its infantry attacks. There are dead and wounded on both 
sides. There are [words indistinct]. 
  UN military observers were also surprised by the ferocity of 
the attacks. The residents of Gorazde and all others that are 
here are again surprised by the passivity of the world 
community. NATO aircraft have not been flying over Gorazde, 
which is a protected zone, for days. 
  This is Fahrudin Becic reporting from Gorazde.

<F P=106> [Article by Branko Peric: "Mark Brothers"] </F>
  [Text] The top government leadership of the Srpska republic 
was alarmed in early January by the emergence of a special form 
of war profiteering: large-scale trade with the enemy. Data of 
the security services indicated that prohibited trade had been 
taking place for quite some time at 26 points along the "lines 
of contact," mainly with the Muslim army. Military experts 
estimated that this phenomenon is a "form of planned special 
warfare" and that it could seriously threaten the country's 
defense capability. 
  On 18 January 1994, the president of the state formed a 
state 
commission headed by Major General Bogdan Subotic to interdict 
this phenomenon "by all available means." The chairman of the 
state commission has formed a staff of the best-known experts 
from Public Security and Military Security, inspectorates, and 
judicial bodies, and he chose for the operation known as "Border 
94" Teslic Opstina, in which the border with the Muslim army is 
about 120 km long, and where trade with the enemy has assumed 
"disturbing proportions." 
  The knowledge gained by the state commission has astonished 
everyone. In Vucja Planina an open-air market where several 
hundred people gathered has "operated" daily right alongside the 
trenches. Serbian and Muslim soldiers, Serbian and Muslim 
civilians, were buying and selling. Everything was being sold, 
just like at the ordinary open-air market. The Serbs even hauled 
goods to the Muslim trenches in trucks. The Muslims were being 
sold artillery shells and even mortars. The Serbs in Teslic who 
live in daily fear of shelling, who have come to the town from 
the direction of Tesanj, cannot believe that the Serbian 
soldiers are selling those same shells to the Muslims. 
<H5>  The Fund </H5>
  During the operation, which lasted a month in Teslic, goods 
intended for prohibited trade were confiscated in the amount of 
990,000 German marks [DM]. Cash derived from prohibited trade 
amounting to DM337,698, 42,870 Austrian schillings, 18,000 Swiss 
francs, and $3,250 was confiscated from individuals. Inspections 
by the inspectorate shut down 35 private firms and independent 
shops. Twenty-three legal entities inspected were found not to 
have paid state tax on time in the amount of DM3,403,427. With 
the interest accrued, the tax obligation of those debtors 
amounts to DM9,655,000. Criminal and misdemeanor charges were 
filed against 422 persons, and 49 persons were detained. 
Criminal charges were also filed against the opstina president, 
the former chairman of the Executive Committee, the chief of the 
public security station, and several enterprise managers. 
  The business being done by the wartime suppliers runs into 
millions of marks ending up in the pockets of individuals. Along 
the lengthy chain of middlemen, the earnings are beyond the 
dreams of ordinary mortals. DM250,000 were found buried in the 
vicinity of the house of someone living near the demarcation 
line on Vucja Planina. 
  Among the mysterious stories circulating in Teslic, the most 
interesting one is about the flight of two Muslim soldiers taken 
prisoner as they were carrying on trade along the line. These 
two prisoners disappeared one night from the detention 
facilities of the military police in Teslic, and the manner of 
their escape and who is to blame for it has not been ascertained 
to this day. There is suspicion that they were released so that 
they would not expose those with whom they were trading or that 
they themselves were traded in a good bit of business. 
  The state commission obtained much more important knowledge 
in its study of the operation of opstina authorities and 
commercial firms. It was found that the opstina had its own fund 
of foreign exchange, referred to as the war fund, which by 
opstina decision was receiving the income tax on individuals 
working abroad in the amount of DM300 per month and DM50 for 
individuals working in republics of the former SFRY [Socialist 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. According to the republic 
statute, this tax has been uniformly set for the entire republic 
at DM200 and is a revenue of the state itself. 
  Not only did the opstina authority not respect the republic 
statute, but it evaded all the rules of business finance in the 
way it handled the money collected. No decision was made on 
establishment of the fund, no rules were established on 
conducting its affairs, nor were management authorities 
elected.... The funds were handled by the opstina president, the 
chairman of the Executive Committee, the secretary of the 
Secretariat for the Economy, and the chief accountant: by word 
of mouth, in writing, over the telephone, however it suited 
them. Money was given to individuals, who signed a receipt that 
was thrown away when the money was repaid. DM5 million were 
spent from the "war fund" in slightly more than a year and a 
half. 
<H5>  The List </H5>
  The funds were used by government-owned and private 
commercial firms, institutions, government bodies, and 
individuals.... Individuals carried some of the foreign exchange 
in briefcases to Belgrade where they exchanged it in private 
currency exchanges at an exchange rate known only to themselves. 
The people and the government can only guess as to their honesty 
and integrity. It is sufficient to know that the merchants 
carried to Serbia hundreds of thousands of marks to buy flour, 
sugar, oil, and other goods, while at the same time inflation 
was rendering worthless the immense claims of the Teslic economy 
in Serbia. Anyone who risked suspicion knew why he did so. 
  An examination of the financial and accounting documents of 
commercial firms revealed all the shortcomings of current 
legislation and all the resourcefulness of dishonest merchants. 
Imported goods are accompanied by one set of documents to the 
border, another set from the border to the destination, and then 
it is all shredded. Bills of lading are even used made out to 
customers who have nothing at all to do with the goods ordered 
except being located in the same town. Thus, there are cases, 
according to the documentation, when the business of certain 
firms has increased slightly over the previous year, although 
everyone knows that trade has been flourishing. Given this way 
of doing business and taxes made worthless by inflation, it is 
clear how individuals have acquired immense wealth in a short 
time through trade. 
  While the state commission is writing up criminal charges 
and 
making a list of illegalities and irregularities committed in 
the presence and with the blessing of the authorities, the 
opstina committee of the SDS [Serbian Democratic Party] is 
writing up a list of enterprise managers and government 
officials who are not members of the party and on whose 
trustworthiness members of the SDS opstina committee are to take 
a position. Of the 32 enterprise directors and officials on the 
list, only eight are members of the party. The rest are to be 
removed, but it is not clear who will do this and how. One thing 
is certain: The new uniformity of thought is turning the 
proclaimed democracy into dictatorship, and all the rest is 
familiar territory. 
<H5>  The Remedy </H5>
  Members of the staff of the operation "Border 94" in Teslic 
are concluding on the basis of that operation's results that the 
pattern in Teslic reflects that in the entire republic. For a 
well-meaning observer of local conditions, the logical 
conclusion cannot be avoided that the present chaotic situation 
is the result of the wrong policy by the wrong people. How 
otherwise to explain the fact that criminal charges have been 
filed against the most responsible individuals in the opstina 
government? How is one to explain the fact that opstina 
authorities have done nothing to thwart and prevent goods from 
reaching the front line? 
  Gen. Subotic declared war on criminals in a press conference 
which he held in the Culture Center in Banja Luka on 25 
February, and that same evening on the program "Open Screen" 
over Banja Luka television. Viewers gave him credit and offered 
him support, but did not fail to ask him when he would get 
around to other cities and when the people would finally learn 
who the culprits were in the affair of the "Golfs." 
  The general was self-confident and made a public promise 
that 
the commission would take its work to the end and that the time 
would come ultimately when the culprits in the well-known 
scandal of the "Golfs" would be made public. It remains to be 
seen whether the general was caught by an embarrassing question 
or the time of truth has really come. Quite a few people are 
doubtful about the success of the general's campaign. By and 
large, the people have stood by the general, and his failure 
could signify defeat of a policy.

  [Text] Belgrade, 29 March (TANJUG) -- Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia President Zoran Lilic today received special Libyan 
envoy 'Ali 'Abd-al-Salam al-Turyaki, who handed him a message 
from Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi. 
  Their talks focused on the further improvement of the 
already 
successful and friendly cooperation between the two countries, 
both in the bilateral and international fields. They paid 
particular attention to some aspects of economic cooperation. 
  Speaking about the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, President 
Lilic 
expressed the hope that we are not far from peace, which he said 
was a condition for stability in the entire region. President 
Lilic stressed that the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] has 
nothing against the Muslim-Croat federation, provided that it is 
not to the detriment of the Serb side; he also said there would 
be neither a solution nor peace in this former Yugoslav republic 
without an equitable agreement reached between all three sides 
and the observance of the right of each of the nations to 
self-determination. 
  As regards the FRY, it will continue to strive in a 
persistent, active, and constructive way toward reaching a 
permanent and just resolution of the crisis on the territory of 
former Yugoslavia, as it has done since the very outset of the 
crisis, President Lilic concluded.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, March 29 (TANJUG) -- President of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Zoran Lilic said on Tuesday that 
this country had nothing against a Moslem-Croat Federation in 
civil war torn Bosnia-Herzegovina provided it was not 
detrimental to the third side, the Serbs. 
  During the talks with special Libyan envoy 'Ali 'Abd 
al-Salam 
al-Turyaki, who presented to Lilic a message from Libyan leader 
Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, Lilic said that there would be no peace 
in Bosnia without agreement on an equal footing between all 
three warring sides and without respect of the rights of every 
nation to self-determination. 
  A war of local Serbs, Croat and Moslems has been raging in 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina for almost 
two years. Croats and Moslems signed an agreement on a 
federation in mid-March under U.S. pressure. The question of 
the Serbs joining the federation has remained open, but 
representatives of this people on several occasions pointed out 
that the recognition of the right to self-determination of 
Moslems and Croats meant that Serbs had the same right as well. 
The Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina have proclaimed their own state 
which covers round 70 percent of the territory of this former 
Yugoslav republic. 
  Lilic expressed hope that peace in Bosnia was not far, 
saying 
it was a precondition for stability in the entire region. The 
better part of the talks between the Yugoslav president and the 
Libyan envoy was devoted to the promotion of the already 
successful bilateral cooperation, especially in the area of 
economics. The Libyan envoy was also received today by Yugoslav 
Minister for Foreign Trade Relations Milorad Unkovic. Al-Turyaki 
expressed Libya's readiness to send humanitarian aid to 
Yugoslavia through Red Cross organizations. He said that this 
was a symbolic act with which Libya wished to show good will and 
understanding for its old friend -- Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 29 (TANJUG) -- The situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has again become confusing as the local 
Moslem-Croat Federation is on the U.S. tracks, while the Bosnian 
Serbs renounce the "project" remaining on the sidelines, 
although it is a common belief that, without them, there can be 
no peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The fresh round of talks will include the Bosnian Serbs, 
whose absence makes the peace "impossible". This round of 
diplomatic action, as is announced in Washington, aims not only 
to bring the Serbs to the negotiating table, but also to find 
something they and the Moslem-Croat Federation could reach an 
agreement on. 
  Two things are crucial to this: First, to reach an agreement 
on relations between the Moslem-Croat Federation and the Bosnian 
Serb republic, and, secondly, to resolve territorial demarcation 
issues between the federation and the Bosnian Serb republic. 
  Although the Serbs refused to join the Moslem-Croat 
Federation, they do not rule out the possibility of establishing 
a trilateral union in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a feasible solution, 
especially if confederal relations with countries outside 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are not insisted upon. 
  The territorial demarcation issue is the most difficult, but 
it could also be solved. The problem had nearly been resolved in 
Geneva and Brussels, when the differences have been reduced to 
only a few percentages. 
  Now that the Moslem-Croat Federation package has been tied, 
U.S. presidential envoy Charles Redman announces a return to 
Geneva, speaking to that effect about the former demarcation 
lines. It was, in fact, a deal offering 33.3 per cent of the 
territory to the Moslems, 17.5 per cent to the Croats and about 
50 per cent to the Serbs. The deal broke down at the last 
minute after Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic rejected it 
under the pretext of being dissatisfied with the quality of the 
territories. 
  The "Geneva idea" is now back in circulation and, all things 
considered, the U.S. and Russian presidential envoys, Charles 
Redman and Vitaliy Churkin, will take it as a starting point of 
a fresh round of the talks. 
  In the meantime, talks between Croatia and the republic of 
Serb Krajina officials resume, Yugoslav and Croatian bureaus 
have opened in Belgrade and Zagreb and a question of "a phased 
economic restoration in the entire territory of the former 
Yugoslavia" has been raised at a meeting of the working group in 
charge of economic issues within the Geneva conference on the 
former Yugoslavia. 
  No matter how utopian any of these issues might sound, a 
peace option is mostly being considered and supported. The 
major foothold is that the Americans and the Russians are so 
deeply involved in Bosnia-Herzegovina that they would not let it 
slip away so easily. They would otherwise lose face, which would 
be a greater disgrace than the one the European Union had 
experienced there.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Maria Wagrowska: "A Signal for the West"] </F>
  [Text] Poland will soon submit a motion requesting 
admission to the European Union [EU]. This very act itself will 
not really draw us closer to membership in this organization; 
however, it will confirm to all of Europe and to the Polish 
people that Poland links its future to the West. When European 
Commission Deputy Chairman Hennig Christophersen heard the news 
about the intention of the Polish authorities, he did not really 
encourage taking this step; he implied, however, that the motion 
would be a clear declaration of Poland's intention. 
  Poland will be able to think about equal participation in 
the 
West European integration only when the present "Twelve," and 
then "Sixteen" (after the European Free Trade Zone states join 
the union) decide that it has proved itself. Right now, there 
are no reasons to claim that the EU will want to admit Poland, 
Hungary, or other postcommunist states of Central Europe. The 
only such signal--which, however, is by no means a 
commitment--was the Declaration by the Copenhagen summit of the 
"Twelve" in June 1993. 
  Despite that, it is good that the Government of the Polish 
Republic decided to submit the motion, which was backed by the 
president. The resolution by the Council of Ministers, which 
consists of representatives of postcommunist parties (in the 
past, the Polish Peasant Party used to express considerable 
reservations concerning the association treaty, whose fragments 
dealt with trade in agricultural products), finally dispels any 
doubts concerning the pro-Western direction in the foreign, and 
partially commercial, policy of our state. The government's 
decision puts an end to the speculations of some Western 
observers, who claimed that Poles have difficulties resulting 
from an insufficiently liberalized exchange of goods and 
services with the "Twelve"; they also pointed out that Poles are 
disappointed with the stands of both the EU and NATO on Central 
Europe and thus may be discouraged from the West. The 
announcement of submitting a motion requesting admission in the 
EU may also help work out some intermediate form between 
association (which has been in force since 1 February 1994) and 
full membership in the EU. Even though so far no intermediate 
form has been discussed, various ideas keep coming up, in the 
West, as well, about how Central and West Europe could be linked 
more closely: politically, militarily, or economically. It is 
impossible to rule out the possibility that, depending on 
further developments, some kind of a transitory form of Poland's 
participation in the Western structures will be accepted. This 
would definitely draw Poland closer to the West.

<F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski: "Lech Walesa--An </F>
Opposition Activist"] 
  [Text] Lech Walesa has been acting in a way that is 
characteristic of opposition activists: He weakens the 
political rival at every opportunity--sometimes it is because he 
has reasons, and, at other times, it is just for the sake of 
principle. In a situation when the Democratic Union is not 
capable of redefining its identity after the elections, Walesa 
is currently the only "institution" that is persistently opposed 
vis-a-vis the victorious coalition. 
  And he is dealing with the situation in his own way: He 
would not be able to handle both the Democratic Left Alliance 
[SLD] and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] so he courts and 
bestows favors on the latter. He would have much less room for 
maneuver if the SLD and the PSL were able to speak with one 
voice, at least on the most important issues. 
  By rejecting Rosati's candidacy, Walesa made public the fact 
that the SLD's personnel reserves are small. The president 
says: Provide me with another candidate, please (as if 
implying: After all, the party that won the elections should 
have plenty of candidates!) 
  An opportunity arose, so it is worth doing some teasing and 
showing that the victorious party does not have many candidates 
ready to assume the post of deputy prime minister and finance 
minister. In addition, the one candidate the SLD could possibly 
submit--that is, Leslaw Paga--has already been submitted by 
Walesa himself. After that happened, Kwasniewski could be 
prevented from submitting Paga's name if only for reasons of 
prestige. 
  The SLD and its leader responded in a way that can make Lech 
Walesa happy. For four days now, it has not been capable of 
coming up with any idea for solving the conflict. All the party 
does is make announcements several times a day that it upholds 
Rosati's candidacy. 
  The SLD feels offended by the facts. Regardless of how 
unfair, in the SLD's view, the president's decision is, it is 
still a fact. Walesa had a constitutional right not to sign the 
nomination. He did it for reasons he officially announced and 
also because he likes to provoke people and then wait to see 
what the outcome will be. 
  The SLD leaders refuse to take cognizance of Lech Walesa's 
decision. Aleksander Kwasniewski lets emotions take control of 
him, accuses the president of trying to destabilize the state, 
and flees from journalists in the Sejm building by using a 
ladder. In this situation, which is difficult but occasionally 
present in politics, one could have expected different behavior 
from a politician of the year 1993, the chief of the biggest 
deputies club in the Sejm and a "prime minister without 
portfolio." 
  The coalition is acting in the president's favor. It was 
known from the time of the elections that the issue of a 
possible limitation of the president's powers will have to be 
dealt with at some point. The coalition overdid it in their 
"testing" by giving Walesa an answer to the question of how much 
he can fear such a step on the coalition's part. As it turned 
out, he does not have to fear that very much in the end. Marek 
Borowski, who had threatened the president with limiting his 
powers, was immediately disciplined by his own colleagues from 
the Sejm deputy club. 
  Lech Walesa must be active so as not to be pushed into 
oblivion. "Not to let them forget about me" seems to be the 
president's main slogan of the moment. If he were to be 
obedient, the PSL-SLD coalition would probably be gaining in 
strength, whereas Walesa would become marginal. 
  And that is the way it is probably going to be; such 
behavior 
by Lech Walesa will be a permanent element of the political 
scene until the time of the presidential elections. This is why 
it made even less sense for the SLD to have reacted by feeling 
offended by the facts.

  [Excerpts] Lech Walesa's meeting with journalists and 
members of the SLOWO-DZIENNIK KATOLICKI editorial team at the 
paper's editorial office lasted almost two hours. [passage 
omitted] The president said that he has decided to run in the 
next presidential election because of the other candidates. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Begin Walesa recording] There are only professors and great 
politicians around. I am president, and I shall remain 
president for a long time because I know about politics. I 
shall do it, although it may surprise everyone. What happened 
at the last elections? Everyone was so sure, but what was the 
outcome? I shall do what is necessary for Poland, and I will 
remain within the law. I will not break the law. If a 
particular solution is necessary, this solution will happen. 
Who will win? Certainly not the Democratic Left Alliance this 
time. It will happen in accordance with the law, and I shall do 
it wearing kid gloves. When they all find out the results, it 
will be too late. 
  I am not changing my opinion because I respect Prime 
Minister 
Pawlak very much. However, Pawlak is a very talented young man 
who has no experience with people in the streets, 
stone-throwing, strikes, and all of that. I can predict what 
times like these will bring, and this is only a prelude. Some 
people can already smell gunpowder and some cannot. I am afraid 
that Pawlak cannot bear the burden of these solutions. 
Moreover, he has a very unrepresentative parliament. I am not 
undermining democracy. I respect it, but I am talking about 
facts that result in more facts. I have foreseen, and I can 
still see, that he will have a difficult life and that he is 
wasted at a time like this. 
  What would the outcome of the elections have been if they 
had 
listened to me then? What would the situation be now? Totally 
different. Fate has accomplished what I wisely proposed 
earlier, but no one writes about this. I wish Pawlak all the 
best, although I am afraid the issues involved are so difficult 
that great experience is needed to cope with them. Pawlak does 
not have experience because of his age and track record. 
  The time has come that we must talk to all social groups, 
including workers. If this stage comes earlier as a result of 
irresponsible behavior or an attempt to change the Constitution, 
other issues will also have to be examined, and more talks will 
have to take place. 
  I favor clarity on the most vital issues, clarity of 
government actions and clarity of economic conditions and 
prospects, so we can feel more certain and can make better 
choices tomorrow. I would like the situation before the 
elections to be clear, so that the nation knows who it is 
choosing, so that the nation is convinced that it must choose, 
so that the elections go well, and so that we can win. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Article by E. Cz: "Will the SLD Leave the Coalition?"] </F>
  [Text] If this were a normal Sejm, in which it were clear 
what one can expect from which party and it were clear that all 
sides would stick to their agreements, the ruling coalition 
would not exist today. This is claimed by certain members of the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. 
  An agreement between the Democratic Union [UD] and the Union 
of Labor [UP] would have been enough to push through the vote of 
no-confidence in the government and establish a cabinet 
supported by the Sejm and independent from the president. If 
the SLD were not able to reach such an agreement, the Polish 
Peasant Party [PSL] would do that because both partners are 
beginning to consider the coalition uncomfortable. Meanwhile, 
as unofficial reports indicate, the leftists and the peasants 
have independently examined the possibility of taking such a 
step in the Sejm, in both cases without any results. 
<H5>  Doomed to Themselves </H5>
  The difficulty to receive the prime minister's acceptance 
regarding personnel decisions put forward by the SLD, as well as 
the suspicions that cooperation is blocked with the quiet 
consent of the president, were not the only reasons behind the 
hitherto discrepancies inside the coalition. These conflicts, 
however, have been the most visible to the public. Left-wing 
politicians begin to more and more loudly accuse the peasants of 
lacking competence, which is predominantly described as a lack 
of vision of how the state should function--in both the 
administrative and the economic spheres. The draft decree on 
the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM], which has been 
submitted for consultations among the coalition members and 
certain voivodship leaders, is supposed to testify to the first 
accusation. The first opinions, which are not without 
resentments, are that the draft, which has been presented by 
Minister Strak, contains only two concrete proposals: First, the 
prime minister is the most important person in the government, 
and second, the URM chief is next, after the prime minister. As 
critics of the draft unofficially claim, numerous articles of 
the draft have nothing in common with the reform of the central 
administration. 
  The weakness of the PSL's intellectual potential and the 
small number of economic experts working for it are supposed to 
be proof of their lack of economic vision. The left wing is 
therefore convinced that the PSL will not break the coalition 
without support from a party that has a concrete economic 
program and people who could implement it. 
<H5>  Only the Opposition </H5>
  It is also very unlikely that the SLD will decide to suspend 
the coalition. Numerous concessions to the PSL indicate that 
the left wing wants to remain in power, and it is able to 
swallow a lot to achieve this. The only thing that could make 
it leave the coalition would be clear and demonstrative 
disloyalty of the prime minister. Waldemar Pawlak, as the 
conflict over Dariusz Rosatti shows, will not run this risk, 
however. 
  Political alignment determines whether the SLD's place today 
is in the government with the PSL or in the opposition. Being 
in the government, the SLD becomes a client of the PSL, if it 
wants to implement its program. If the SLD ended up in the 
opposition, both sides would have to switch their roles. It 
would be Pawlak who would have to exert himself to win over the 
friendship of Kwasniewski and his club. Apparently, the left 
wing is beginning to use this scarecrow more and more often. 
The SLD politicians, however, still believe that the conflict 
with the president will finally convince both leaders, 
particularly the prime minister, that they will manage to 
survive the long-dreamed-of four years in the Sejm only in close 
cooperation. 
  If the coalition manages to jointly overcome the political 
crisis, for which the SLD is striving, the left wing will 
probably further chill its relations with the president. 
  Given the current majority in the Sejm, we actually do not 
need the president, reminds one of the SLD leaders. He also 
announces that the coalition can minimize the president's 
ability to make political decisions before the next elections. 
<H5>  They Will Stay Because They Have No Choice </H5>
  Jan Rokita (UD), who indicates that he is not convinced "it 
is a good thing in politics to answer the question of what your 
political opponents are going to do," does not believe that the 
coalition will split in the near future. Arguments in favor of 
preserving the coalition are stronger than the controversy over 
the program, which is currently dividing and will continue to 
divide it. 
  The PSL and the SLD are primarily divided over 
redistribution 
of the GDP--whether it should be used to stabilize the 
agricultural sector or to fulfill the SLD's election promises to 
the budget sector. I am convinced, however, that the willpower 
in both the PSL and the SLD is still strong enough to patch this 
discrepancy for a long time. I do not believe that the SLD 
leadership can allow itself to leave the coalition because this 
would mean that thousands of people who are associated with the 
communist apparatus would lose the chance to regain their 
position, which was endangered during the past four years. They 
would probably not forgive Kwasniewski for the rest of his life. 
  It is hard for Jaroslaw Kaczynski (Center Accord) to predict 
how the SLD will react--it can leave Pawlak alone, not 
overthrowing him but leaving him with certain responsibilities. 
Another two schemes can also prevail--opportunism and waiting 
for the presidential elections and adoption of a new 
constitution, meaning a situation favorable for the SLD. The 
decision of the SLD can also be affected by other factors. I 
know nothing about the mood inside the SLD. Is it true that 
Oleksy is against Kwasniewski and that Kwasniewski feels beset 
by others? Kwasniewski must also reckon with the "retro" 
apparatus, which does not want to be in the opposition. 
  The humiliation of the SLD by the prime minister and the 
president, in the opinion of Kaczynski, is a result of an error 
committed by the SLD at the beginning. While forming the 
government, Kwasniewski should have stated: Either we get the 
office of prime minister or a ministry, or we do not join the 
government. 
  The SLD will definitely not leave the coalition, Wieslawa 
Ziolkowska (UP) insists. It will feel the pressure of "the 
responsibility for the fate of our country." 
  The SLD will not leave the coalition because it does not 
have 
any political interest in doing this, Janusz Piechocinski (PSL) 
claims. The coalition has not yet begun to implement its 
program. It would therefore be hard for them to explain that 
they did not manage to do anything in this situation. 
  I do not expect any significant political movements in the 
political arena before the local elections or even before next 
fall. If such tensions between the president and the government 
recur, however, the SLD may leave the coalition and support a 
minority government of Pawlak and the Belweder. In such a case, 
however, Pawlak would have to find time and understanding for 
Kwasniewski's opinions.

<F P=106> [Article by B.I.W.: "Solidarity: We Expected To Be Treated </F>
Seriously"] 
  [Text] Solidarity ["S"] is outraged at the statement by 
Deputy Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, who, following 
the session of the Social-Political Committee of the Council of 
Ministers [RM] and the Economic Council of the RM, stated that 
there are no formal obstacles for discussing the "S" demands in 
substantive negotiations. However, the negotiations should be 
held in the Trilateral Commission and in teams negotiating 
social guarantees. "S" is waiting for the RM to make a 
statement on the talks of the union and government experts. "Any 
delaying of the date will be treated by us as a breach of the 
agreement," we were told by "S" Experts' Team Chief Stanislaw 
Alot. 
  Today [30 March] in Katowice, the "S" Protest Headquarters 
will convene. It is possible that, if the government rejects 
this information, we will decide to stage a general strike. 
  In the context of the above-mentioned statement by 
Cimoszewicz, National Committee Press Spokesman Piotr Zak 
stressed that, "during talks with government experts, the `S' 
experts proved that all demands submitted by our union, except 
those demanding state property for citizens and the introduction 
of a 40-hour workweek, must be negotiated only between the 
Independent Self-Governing Trade Union `S' and the government." 
  "By making a statement on the issue of representativeness, 
Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, a lawyer, justice minister, and deputy 
prime minister, demonstrated compromising ignorance. One cannot 
mistake the representativeness of a party in parliamentary 
elections for the representativeness of organizations of 
employers and employees--that is, trade unions," declared Zak. 
It is worth recalling that Cimoszewicz said in the television 
program "Panorama" that the issue of representativeness had not 
been resolved so far, and that "the labor world decides through 
its membership, paying subscription fees, and voting in 
parliamentary elections": "Because of that, the 
representativeness of "S" might be questioned. We are not doing 
that; we are treating this union seriously; however, we will not 
allow anyone to dictate anything to us," said Cimoszewicz. "S" 
demands that the representativeness of unions be observed, 
especially in the Trilateral Committee negotiations. 
  "For the time being, the deputy prime minister is not the 
RM," stated Alot, and added that they are awaiting the 
government opinion. "The declarations were unequivocal: The 
information will be submitted at the next RM session." 
  According to Alot, the "S" demands have been presented in a 
better form than the election programs of some parties: "We 
expected to be treated seriously."

<F P=106> [Interview with Ludovit Cernak, a member of the Preparatory </F>
Committee of the National Democratic Party, and Roman Kovac, a 
member of the Preparatory Committee of the Alternative of 
Political Realism, by Jana Pankovcinova and Alica Strbava; place 
and date not given: "Why Have Cernak's, Knazko's, and 
Moravcik's Parties Not Unified?"] 
  [Text] The first assembly of the National Democratic Party 
(NDS) will be held in Zvolen today. According to reports from 
one month ago, this should have been the merger congress of the 
NDS, the Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic [AD SR], 
and the supporters of Roman Kovac and Jozef Moravcik. 
  [SME] Why will the centrist parties not merge on Saturday 
[26 March]? 
  [Cernak] Following all of the talks that have been held, 
there is unanimous will to proceed jointly. However, we realize 
our responsibility before voters not to create an incoherent 
conglomerate, as was the case with the Public Against Violence 
movement or the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, which later 
fell apart. There is only one remaining difference among us. 
Colleagues Knazko, Kovac, and Moravcik identify more with 
liberal ideas and the Liberal International, while we find 
sympathetic a conservative orientation and the European 
Democratic Union. We have therefore decided to establish two 
entities--a liberal one and one with a conservative orientation. 
Otherwise, we have almost identical programs, and it is highly 
probable that, before the elections, we will set up a centrist 
coalition bloc. Meanwhile, the AD SR will merge with Moravcik's 
followers. We will proceed further according to the political 
circumstances, but for sure jointly. 
  [Kovac] Mainly because the Alternative of Political Realism 
is not technically prepared for such a step yet. In view of the 
fact that Cernak's group has been preparing its assembly for a 
long time, we have agreed that its assembly should go ahead. We 
must still complete the technical preparations. The question of 
further cooperation will be assessed by us in mid-April. 
  [SME] Will you discuss a merger or merely a joint ticket for 
the elections? 
  [Kovac] I do not rule out either possibility. 
  [SME] In other words, you deny the information from behind 
the scenes, according to which the reason for the failure of the 
centrist parties to merge is the problem of who would be the 
party's chairman? Besides, not all of the centrist parties have 
established structures in the countryside. The NDS is the sole 
exception, and it would thus probably have the largest number of 
elected delegates at the merger congress.... 
  [Cernak] What you say has its logic. Apart from the 
differences in the orientation of our programs, which I have 
already mentioned, there is among us yet another difference of 
opinion: how to build the party. The AD SR has already 
declared that it would be a selective party and Messrs. Moravcik 
and Kovac, too, would not want to build their structures any 
further than the district level. We, on the other hand, are 
trying to win "our man" in every small village. It should be a 
person who commands authority at the local level and who could 
explain the party's program and objectives. We had differences 
on this point, and the problem regarding the number of delegates 
would apparently also result from this. However, for me, this 
is not a substantial issue. If we want to successfully defy 
Meciar's populism and his visits to every little village, we 
must do the same and rebut his assertions by making our 
arguments heard in the same village. 
  [SME] Who else, besides you, is running for NDS chairman? 
  [Cernak] I am not the only person running. There will be at 
least two or three candidates. The list of candidates will be 
put forward today. I do not want to anticipate events.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jan Luptak, chairman of the Association of </F>
Workers of Slovakia, by Oldrich Zabojnik; place and date not 
given: "New Workers Party Is Taking Shape"] 
  [Text] Representatives of some parties devote increasing 
attention to the founding of a new political entity--the 
Association of Workers of Slovakia [Zdruzenie robotnikov 
Slovenska, ZRS]. ZRS Chairman Jan Luptak, deputy to the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic for the Party of the 
Democratic Left [SDL], granted an interview to the Bratislava 
correspondent of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. 
  [Zabojnik] With what feelings did you, as the only worker in 
the Slovak parliament, receive the contemptuous reaction of 
deputies when you recently spoke about the difficult social 
situation of people who live by the work of their own hands? 
  [Luptak] I was not surprised because it was not the first 
such reaction. I have been to 245 factories and know exactly 
what people in production take an interest in and what their 
problems and worries are. It is their language I speak in 
parliament. 
  [Zabojnik] How do these people respond to the declining 
living standards and growing social tension? 
  [Luptak] Their stands are very harsh, and I cannot even 
interpret them here. Workers at Hnust said to me, for example: 
Remind Meciar of the promises he made when he was here and how 
it all ended. We are now 600, out of an original work force of 
2,600, and we are all worried about our jobs. The previous 
management had salaries of 18,000 [currency not specified], and 
their successors made themselves a gift of 22,000 and bought 
themselves another posh limousine, in a situation in which the 
factory has no money to pay wages. I think, therefore, that 
transformation can hardly be made only on the backs of the 
people below. This situation cannot last forever, in our 
country or anywhere else. The Czech trade unions have also 
already made that clear. 
  [Zabojnik] In the last public opinion survey in Slovakia, 
your ZRS remained only 0.2 percent below the 5-percent threshold 
necessary to get into parliament. Are you planning to go into 
the elections on your own or as some kind of SDL reserves? 
  [Luptak] We are not reserves of the SDL; we are an 
independent party. Workers must have a clear position in the 
left-wing spectrum. They must exist as an organized opposition. 
Of course, our aim is not a government of workers or some kind 
of a dusted-down version of Bolshevism. 
  [Zabojnik] How many members does the ZRS muster, and from 
where does it get funds? 
  [Luptak] After achieving a membership of 13,000, we have 
stopped providing any more figures. Inasmuch as we are about to 
go into the elections, we naturally do not want to abet other 
parties in any way. Our funds come from collections organized 
by workers in Martin, Ziar, and elsewhere among themselves. In 
the ZRS headquarters in Banska Bystrica, we are also preparing 
the publication of our own newspaper. 
  [Zabojnik] On what will your program be built? 
  [Luptak] On the fact that there exists no wealth greater 
than people's work and skills. The situation must not be 
tolerated, for example, of a society as poor as ours affording 
the luxury of 360,000 unemployed who collect money produced by 
the belt-tightening of others. It is necessary to separate 
those who really do not have a chance [of finding a job] at the 
moment from those who do not want to work and do not deserve 
more than some 300-400 korunas in social support. Where shall 
we end up with masses of people receiving 2,000-2,200 korunas 
without moving a finger!? 
  [Zabojnik] What causes would your parliamentary deputies 
pursue? 
  [Luptak] They would see to it that no laws are passed that 
are directed against the interests of workers and the working 
intelligentsia. Not only is the Labor Code directed against 
workers, but also privatization as a whole, in the course of 
which millions of people have been deprived of values they 
themselves created. It is scandalous when rogues, cheats, and 
criminal elements live at our expense. Workers have been 
deceived many times since November [1989], and they have come to 
understand that they must have their own party if they do not 
want to become extinct as a social group.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Pavol Kanis by Julius </F>
Gembicky in Bratislava on 25 March: "We Have Opened Doors to 
Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Pavol Kanis, minister of defense of the 
Slovak Republic, returned last night from a three-day visit to 
Israel. 
  [Gembicky] Minister Kanis, did any specific opportunities 
for the development of bilateral relations between the Slovak 
Army and the Israeli Army arise from your talks? 
  [Kanis] I exchanged information with Prime Minister and 
Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin about the international political 
position of our countries, the nature of our military doctrines, 
and our present security policies. We familiarized ourselves 
with the structures of the Israeli security system and the 
potential of their arms industry and exchanged views on the 
possibilities of cooperation. Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Shim'on Peres briefed us about Israeli-Palestinian talks and 
Israel's relations with Syria. The visit, which followed up on 
the January visit to Israel by Jozef Moravcik, then chief of our 
diplomacy, has enabled closer contacts between our ministries of 
defense. Given the fact that Jozef Moravcik is now prime 
minister, one can speak about a certain continuity. 
  [Gembicky] The Israeli defense system and the Israeli 
defense industry are among the best in the world. Your 
entourage included experts from the military industry. In what 
areas can we effectively cooperate with the Israeli military and 
strategic branches? 
  [Kanis] We apply two criteria in building the Army of the 
Slovak Republic: cost-efficiency, which must be commensurate 
with our economic potential, and our Army's adequate military 
and strategic effectiveness, which must correspond to the 
principles of defense sufficiency and the need for rational 
deterrence. While visiting several arms firms, our military 
experts had an opportunity to assess the standard of the 
production of arms and arms systems in Israel. We exchanged 
ideas and offers regarding cooperation and possible trade and 
will decide on further steps in coordination with military 
experts and entrepreneurs. The possibility of cooperation in 
and the purchase of the technology of electronic systems for the 
Air Force looks promising. 
  [Gembicky] Minister Kanis, were the possibilities of 
exporting Slovak weapons to Israel discussed as well? 
  [Kanis] Even this possibility is opening up in specific 
offers [sentence as published]. 
  [Gembicky] How would you assess the results of your 
three-day visit? 
  [Kanis] I was honored to be able to bestow Milan Rastislav 
Stefanik medals, first grade, upon several Israeli citizens of 
Slovak origin for their participation in antifascist resistance 
and in the Slovak National Uprising. I communicated to leading 
Israeli politicians an invitation to the 50th anniversary of the 
Slovak National Uprising, to which our president has also 
invited U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  [Gembicky] The Hebron massacre has led to the suspension by 
the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] of 
Israeli-Palestinian talks on the creation of Palestinian 
autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. How did your partners assess the 
chances of a speedy resumption of these talks? 
  [Kanis] Minister Shim'on Peres told me yesterday morning 
that it would take a month or a month and a half before the 
treaty with the PLO is signed.

<F P=106> [Article by "rb": "The Army's Wretchedness and Glory; </F>
Association of Slovak Soldiers With the Left at the Ministry of 
Defense"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The appointment of a civilian as 
minister of defense means the realization by the Ministry of 
Defense of the Slovak Republic of the management model advocated 
by the Association of Slovak Soldiers [ASV] since its founding, 
ASV Chairman Lieutenant Colonel Milan Stegena said yesterday. 
Although this appointment ensures civilian control over the 
Army, this control remains insufficient, according to the ASV. 
It therefore proposes the adoption of a law on the control of 
the Army by the National Council of the Slovak Republic. The 
ASV regards as equally important the establishment of a defense 
committee in the parliament. 
  In view of the political affiliation of Defense Minister 
Pavol Kanis, the ASV chairman expressed fear of a possible 
perpetuation of the left-wing profile of the Army of the Slovak 
Republic. "Left-wing forces are forming groups [grupuju sa] at 
the Ministry of Defense. I would cite the example of Professor 
Bartak," he said. Referring to the unsatisfactory model of 
management relations within the department of the Ministry of 
Defense of the Slovak Republic, he said that the 
military-political and executive components of the Army have not 
been consistently separated to this day. There are frequent 
clashes of power between the Ministry of Defense [in Bratislava] 
and the Command of the Army of the Slovak Republic [in Trencin]. 
The ASV does not want to subject the new leadership of the 
Ministry of Defense of the Slovak Republic to criticism during 
its first 100 days in office. This period will show whether 
visible positive changes will occur within the department.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova </F>
by Alena Melicharkova in Vienna on 24 March: "The IMF Is Open 
to Discussion"] 
  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova returned 
from the United States yesterday to assume her office. When we 
addressed her at Schwechat airport, she was willing to answer 
our questions. 
  [Melicharkova] Where were you when you learned that you had 
been appointed as the government member responsible for economic 
policy? 
  [Schmognerova] I did not expect that the no-confidence vote 
in the former prime minister, on the basis of which the former 
government resigned, would have an impact on my personal life. 
At that time, my colleagues and I were on a trip in the United 
States. During this trip, I visited several institutions. I 
learned about the fact in Los Angeles. Immediately after my 
return to the center, I phoned my husband, and he told me about 
the proposal by the people who were forming the government. Of 
course, I wanted to make my situation clear. I spoke with Peter 
Weiss, chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, 
and with Prime Minister Moravcik. On the basis of the 
conversation with them, I accepted the proposal. 
  [Melicharkova] What was the purpose of your visit to the 
United States? 
  [Schmognerova] My trip was expected to take six months. It 
was a working visit organized for future professional 
politicians. This program has been running for three years. It 
is financed by the Pewtery Double Trust company. The Pew 
Freedom Economic Fellow program has three parts--the academic 
one, visits to various institutions and organizations, and the 
practical one, which is carried out in some government 
organization or international financial institutions, or in 
private institutions, as the case may be. 
  [Melicharkova] As deputy prime minister, you have 
participated in debates in the IMF, in several international 
financial institutions, and with U.S. Treasury Department 
representatives. Could you tell us what are the IMF conditions 
for approval of the so-called standby credit to the Slovak 
Republic? There were rumors that the former government had 
prepared a supplement to the already approved IMF memorandum on 
the economic policy of the Slovak Republic Government. What is 
going on in this sphere? What are the new IMF conditions? 
  [Schmognerova] The memorandum on economic policy was drafted 
last year. It is a program outlining the Slovak Republic's 1994 
economic policy. After the IMF visit in January and February of 
this year, the IMF decided, on the basis of the results of the 
1993 budgetary and monetary policy, to complete the memorandum 
with additional conditions in the sphere of financial and 
monetary policy. As far as I know, in the sphere of monetary 
policy, the National Bank of Slovakia has already accepted these 
conditions. The former government did not succeed in drafting 
on time a supplement to the memorandum on the financial policy. 
One of my intentions was to find out to what extent the IMF 
would insist that we exactly meet the demands that were 
formulated in that supplement. Certain parts of the talks 
regarding this matter were really complicated. We succeeded in 
achieving one thing. The IMF will be open to discussion with 
the new government of the Slovak Republic. It is important for 
us to achieve the goals of the 1994 economic policy. They will 
also be open to our suggestions regarding the way we would like 
to attain these goals. I believe this is an important step. 
  [Melicharkova] Do you have any idea to what extent the 
economic policy of the current government will build on the 
economic policy of the former government, and to what extent 
this policy will change? 
  [Schmognerova] We will continue working on the basic tasks 
that have been set out in the program of economic policy. 
During the talks in the United States, I tried to explain that 
our government was determined to achieve these goals. Our 
efforts will be aimed at searching for measures that will allow 
us to meet our objectives. We will certainly have quite 
important differences here, compared with the former government. 
  [Melicharkova] It seems that the 1993 state budget deficit 
is much higher than estimated two months ago. Without the 
deficit in the health care and the education system, it amounts 
to some 30 billion korunas. Do you know how to sort out the 
deficit-related problem and its impact on the economic policy? 
Many people are afraid that it would affect, once again, the 
poorest people.... 
  [Schmognerova] We have to look at the reason our deficit 
increased so much in the last months of 1993. Basically, there 
are three reasons. First, our deficit was mostly affected by 
the payment of our debt to the Czech side outside the clearing 
system. Second, certain National Property Fund claims in the 
banking sphere had to be paid. Third, there were higher 
expenditures from the stage budget. In certain spheres, 
spending substantially exceeded the projected figures. Each of 
these spheres requires a specific attitude and a specific 
solution. In every case, we will have to make efforts to 
prevent such a situation from arising in the course of the year 
or at the end of 1994.

  [Text] [SME] Late last year, the National Council of the

foresees a budget deficit of 14 billion Slovak korunas [Sk]. 
What is the size of the deficit today? 
  [Filkus] As of today, the deficit stands at Sk7.5 billion. 
This demonstrates that the assumption of a deficit at the level 
of Sk14 billion by the end of the year, which was viewed [by the 
previous government] as a realistic macroeconomic indicator, was 
not a realistic macroeconomic assumption.

  [Text] The signing of a cease-fire agreement in the Russian 
Embassy in Zagreb has brought to an end the negotiations between 
the delegations of the Republic of Croatia and rebel Serbs in 
the occupied areas of Croatia. The agreement was signed early 
this morning after 18 hours of talks by, on behalf of the 
Croatian delegation, Hrvoje Sarinic, and, on behalf of the 
representatives of the Serbs, Dusan Rakic. The agreement was 
also signed by the representatives of the international 
conference on the former Yugoslavia, who also chaired the 
negotiations -- ambassadors Geert Ahrens and Kai Eide, as well 
as UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commander General Bertrand de 
Lapresle. The agreement envisages the immediate cessation of 
hostilities between the two sides and that the cease-fire along 
the front lines will begin on 4 April. 
  Thirty-five individual maps on the separation of the warring 
sides were signed, and it was also agreed that by 8 April at the 
latest they would withdraw one km from the front lines. 
UNPROFOR units will then be deployed between the warring sides. 
Hrvoje Sarinic assessed the talks as very successful and 
stressed that the agreement is not an end in itself but only the 
first step toward the normalization of relations throughout the 
territory of Croatia, which will follow the resolution of 
economic problems and also a final political solution.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slobodan Jarcevic, foreign minister of the </F>
Serbian republic of Krajina, by Dragoslav Kosaric in Zagreb on 
30 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Jarcevic] The essence of the agreement is a 
cease-fire, the end of hostilities, and a guarantee by the 
international community and the two superpowers that hostilities 
will not break out again because the UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] will step between the two armies in the so-called 
buffer zone. 
  What is the most important thing that perhaps could not be 
heard at the news conference is that the police of both sides 
will enter these buffer zones, depending on the side to which 
settlements belong. The territories held by one and the other 
side remain completely intact. 
  [Kosaric] What about the deadline for the implementation of 
this agreement? 
  [Jarcevic] The deadline for the realization of this 
agreement is eight days, including the withdrawal of both sides 
and the police remaining in the buffer zone. 
  [Kosaric] What about UNPROFOR, when will it be deployed? 
  [Jarcevic] UNPROFOR will be deployed within 10 days. It 
will, for example, issue documents to the policemen who will be 
in the buffer zone. In this way only those who will obtain 
special UNPROFOR badges will be allowed to serve. UNPROFOR will 
control both sides, and this is perhaps a novelty of this 
agreement, as all earlier plans did not envisage control of the 
arms of the Republic of Croatia. Now they will be controlled, 
too, and positioned 20 km away from the border. In places where 
the Croats do not have a border, like toward the Adriatic Sea, 
they will be more tightly concentrated closer, but it will be 
also allowed that, in the areas were there is no 20 km distance, 
for example in eastern Slavonia, Srem, and Baranja, the Serbian 
Army concentrates more tightly. 
  [Kosaric] This, therefore, means that heavy arms must be at 
a distance of 20 km from the front. 
  [Jarcevic] Yes, with the exception of those emplaced for 
which we have agreed that they will remain. 
  [Kosaric] Is there anything else that is specific in this 
agreement? 
  [Jarcevic] There is nothing specific with the exception of 
that we announced the talks about communications, the economy, 
trade, and the normalization of all relations. Only after this 
phase can we discuss issues of political weight. 
  [Kosaric] Is the date of this meeting already known? 
  [Jarcevic] Well, we said, in roughly two weeks.

  [Text] Knin, 30 Mar (TANJUG) -- The cease-fire agreement 
signed early this morning in Zagreb between the Republic of 
Croatia and the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] is a big success 
and it should now be respected and fully implemented, Rear 
Admiral Dusan Rakic, the head of the Krajina delegation in these 
negotiations and [RSK] defense minister, told a news conference 
in Knin. The agreement comes into effect on 4 April and the 
withdrawal of the forces of the warring sides begins on 7 April. 
Hence, UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], which will now have 
full inspection rights and freedom of movement, will be able to 
move into the cordon sanitaire created in this way. The 
agreement stipulates that heavy weaponry will be withdrawn 20 km 
from the current front lines. Thus, for example, the heavy 
weapons of the Croatian forces will be located in Sibenik and 
Stari Grad and perhaps in some other place, while Serb heavy 
weapons will be located in Gracac, Beli Manastir, and other 
places. 
  Admiral Rakic stressed that the talks were very difficult 
because both sides had to relax their demands and give up some 
pieces of territory in order to reach agreement. In this way, it 
was said, the Peruca hydroelectric power station, Miljevacki 
Plato, part of Maslenica, and Zemunik airport will remain under 
the control of Croatian forces, while Skabrnja near Zadar was 
returned to the Croatians. 
  By way of compensation, the RSK has recovered the Ravni 
Kotari villages of Islam Grcki, Smokovic, and Kasic, and 
Croatian forces are also to withdraw from part of Velebit, which 
is exceptionally important in view of the position of Obrovac 
and the return of people and life to this town on Zrmanja. 
Teslingrad and Jasenovac, the status of which the Serb side did 
not wish to discuss, have remained on the Serb side. The [two] 
police forces, assisted by UNPROFOR inspection teams, will enter 
the cordon sanitaire -- in which some Croatian as well as Serb 
villages remain -- once the armed forces of both sides have 
withdrawn from this area. 
  In the opinion of Assistant [RSK] Interior Minister 
Aleksandar Draca, a member of the RSK delegation, the agreement 
means the end of the war and the beginning of peace, and the 
very important return of the occupied Ravni Kotari villages to 
Krajina. The cease-fire agreement makes possible the 
continuation of the negotiating process on mutual cooperation 
and the resolution of many crucial problems in the field of 
infrastructure, transportation, communications, and other 
questions of mutual interest to Croatia and Krajina. The talks 
on this so-called economic and humanitarian basket will probably 
begin in about two weeks. It is only when these by no means easy 
problems have been resolved that the negotiations should enter 
their third, final, and most difficult phase -- the resolution 
of political relations between the RSK and Croatia.

  [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman granted an 
interview in the Presidential Palace in Zagreb this evening to a 
group of U.S. journalists from the newspapers TIME, the LOS 
ANGELES TIMES, and THE CHICAGO SUN-TIMES in which he spoke about 
the Washington agreement, the policy pursued by the Croatian 
leadership aimed at reintegrating UN protected areas [UNPA] into 
the constitutional and legal system of the Republic of Croatia 
in a peaceful way, normalization of relations between Croatia 
and Serbia, and the new UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] mandate 
in the Republic of Croatia. 
  The resolution that the UN Security Council is about to 
adopt 
will emphasize the political standpoint about the recognition of 
borders of the Republic of Croatia and Croatia's territorial 
integrity. The resolution will extend the UNPROFOR mandate by 
six months, not by 12 months as proposed by UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali. According to the resolution, UNPROFOR will have 
the right to seek air support if prevented in the implementation 
of its tasks, President Tudjman said in reply to the question of 
what Croatia expects from the new UN Security Council resolution. 
  President Tudjman then went on to say that in a political 
sense Croatia could be completely satisfied with the resolution, 
although, he added, the UNPROFOR mandate, due to the lack of 
funds and forces, was not as operational as Croatia would like 
it to be. President Tudjman stated that for its policy Croatia 
had guarantees by the United States and other international 
players. He informed the U.S. journalists that Croatia had 
requested from the United Nations and the Security Council that 
UNPROFOR control the borders between Croatia and Serbia and 
Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to prevent the arming of 
the Serbs in Bosnia- Herzegovina and in the UNPA in Croatia. We 
also demanded the reopening of roads and the oil pipeline and 
the return of around 400,000 refugees to their homes. 
  Asked whether an agreement on a cease-fire and on the 
resolution of the issue of the Serbs living in the occupied 
areas in the Republic of Croatia would be reached in 
negotiations being held in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, 
President Tudjman, laying an emphasis on the current 
international situation, said that the Serbs from Knin, under 
the current international circumstances, would agree with the 
peaceful solution. If they failed to accept that, Croatia would 
then, in line with UN resolutions, be able to resort to other 
means and in that it would enjoy the support of international 
factors. I hold that we shall be able to reintegrate these 
areas into the constitutional and legal system of the Republic 
of Croatia in a peaceful way, the Croatian president stressed. 
  President Tudjman said that the problem of the UNPA's was 
the 
main precondition for the normalization. He said that relations 
could not be normalized as long as Serbia maintained its 
occupation of Croatian areas. Tudjman stressed that despite the 
fact that the Serbian and Yugoslav Governments, under 
international pressure, accepted that the time was ripe for the 
normalization of relations, resolute political moves were 
lacking and extreme Serb war-mongers were still active. 
  After this, President Tudjman replied to questions in 
connection with the solution of the crisis in Bosnia. Asked if a 
possible confederation between Bosnian Serbs and Yugoslavia 
could be linked with the solution for the UNPA's, President 
Tudjman said that these issues could not be linked as Serbs were 
one of the three constituent nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
Serbs in Croatia were a national minority that do not have a 
right to self-determination in accordance with international 
standards. President Tudjman said that the UNPAs have always 
been an integral part of the Republic of Croatia. 
  In reply to a question about Croatia's policy towards 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Tudjman repeated Croatian 
positions to the U.S. journalists. These positions were first 
demonstrated by Bosnian Croat votes at the referendum on an 
independent Bosnia-Herzegovina, then by the support for a 
proposal to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina into provinces, and it 
should also be stressed that Croatia was the first state to have 
recognized the independent Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatia's policy 
has always taken into account the overall interests of the Croat 
nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Tudjman said and 
stressed that the Washington agreement would not have been 
possible if the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna that protected 
the interests of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina had not existed.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Lubor Kohout: "The Long Ears of Our Secret </F>
Service Might Stretch Even Further"] 
  [Text] The government draft law on the Security 
Information Service [BIS] that was submitted recently to 
parliament deputies is based on a single objective: to 
reinforce the powers of the counterintelligence service. 
  The most important change is supposed to be that BIS 
acquires 
the right to actually build a unit that uses intelligence 
technology. This means a unit that installs bugging devices of 
various types, monitors telecommunications, opens and examines 
correspondence, uses identification technology to control 
movement, etc. So far, BIS has depended on the Interior 
Ministry service in the performance of intelligence tasks. The 
ministry used its own equipment when BIS requested it, just as 
it did when the police requested it and formerly with the 
agreement of the prosecutor--today, the judge--and it passed on 
the results only to BIS. Of course, in this way, the Interior 
Ministry was well informed about the activities and subjects of 
interest of the Security Information Service. That apparently 
is the main reason for the endeavors leading to BIS's having at 
its disposal its own division of intelligence technology. 
According to the Interior Ministry Press Department, a transfer 
of these divisions from the Interior Ministry to BIS so that BIS 
would provide the services using the intelligence means for the 
Ministry is out of the question. That way, the situation would 
turn around, and BIS would be informed about police actions, 
which, in turn, quite understandably, the Interior Ministry does 
not want. 
  So, it is most likely that two divisions with intelligence 
technology will be formed, one to remain with the Interior 
Ministry and the other to be formed by BIS. In addition to its 
being a rather costly affair, even BIS cannot prevent the 
participation of the Interior Ministry staffers in telephone 
wiretapping, for instance--namely, the Interior Ministry 
controls the so-called seventh chambers, which have been built 
in the telephone exchanges. The wiretapping usually takes place 
in these rooms. Hence, BIS will be independent only in the use 
of some other intelligence tools. It must be observed here 
that, in comparison with telephone wiretapping, the other 
intelligence operations are used less frequently. Moreover, 
despite the possible technical perfection, their application is 
more demanding on the professional qualities of the secret 
service agents. 
  Is there another solution that would not be so costly and 
yet 
remain effective? There is one, although it may seem rather 
utopian and organizationally and legislatively demanding: to 
separate the divisions with intelligence technology from the 
Interior Ministry and not form them at BIS. The existing 
divisions would be transferred as a special section to the 
Supreme Court, the judges of which are currently deciding on the 
employment of the intelligence technology, or, possibly, to the 
State Attorney's Office. This unit would then, upon the 
approval of the employment by the judge, conduct its own 
service, including the use of the intelligence tools for both 
the police and BIS. In addition to the obvious financial 
saving, another thing would be achieved: a substantial reduction 
in the possibility of an eventual illegal application of the 
intelligence technology by the secret service and the police.

Krejci; place and date not given: "Unsatisfactory Environment

Questions"] 
  [Text] [Krejci] What did the Civic Democratic Party [ODS] 
Executive Committee have in mind when it criticized the activity 
of Environment Minister Benda--improving his work or recalling 
him? 
  [Klaus] There is no simple reply to this question. The 
Environment Ministry's work is not satisfactory. However, it is 
necessary to carefully consider whether this is due to the 
complexity of the problems with which the ministry is dealing or 
a consequence of the minister's own work, whether it is due to 
the ministry's being too big and heavy-handed or whether some 
other factors might be at play. I do not ascribe primary 
importance to differences of views or to the exceptional 
complexity of environmental problems. I think, rather, that the 
reasons this ministry's activity has been very unsatisfactory 
for almost two years [since Frantisek Benda became minister] are 
of a subjective nature and do not rest with the minister alone. 
  [Krejci] The annual rate of inflation fell below 10 percent 
for the first time in February. Is this a permanent trend? 
  [Klaus] The rate of inflation is now nearing the level we 
consider probable over the long term. When we say that the last 
figure for the annual rate of inflation is 9.7 percent, it does 
not mean that I can pledge that, in the months to come, it will 
be 9.4 or 10.1 percent. Anyway, in this area we are moving in 
regions that are a world apart from the other postcommunist 
countries, and I think we are beginning to approach the Western 
level. Nevertheless, the rate of inflation is still at least 
double the European Union average, and getting near this average 
is still a question of a few more years. The adjustment of 
individual prices to their balanced level over the long term is 
still under way, and this process is pushing prices up rather 
than down. 
  [Krejci] Czech Social Democratic Party [CSSD] Chairman Milos 
Zeman has supposedly contacted some politicians in Slovakia and 
proposed the creation of a Czechoslovak Union. What do you 
think about that? 
  [Klaus] Milos Zeman, the CSSD chairman, is incorrigible in 
many ways, including, it seems, in this matter. Every sensible 
person in our country and in Slovakia knows that this issue is 
absolutely not on the agenda and that this is a mere shooting of 
arrows somewhere where there is no target and no spectators.

<F P=106> [Article by Zdenek Zuntych: "The Active Launching of the </F>
JETE First Unit Was Postponed Until September 1996"] 
  [Text] Temelin--According to the current time schedule, 
the fuel charge at the first unit of the Temelin nuclear power 
plant (JETE) should take place in September 1996. It is a new 
date, published for the first time, of the active launching of 
the largest Czech nuclear power plant. After the decision was 
made about the final stage of completing two JETE units, the 
fuel charge was considered for the end of 1995. 
  According to JETE press spokesman Josef Vita, the new date 
stems, above all, from the substantial, very time-consuming 
changes that are now being implemented at the construction on 
the recommendation of the International Atomic Energy Agency and 
expert analyses and the subsequent audit by the U.S. firm NUS 
Haliburton. Examples of this are the system of automatic 
control of the technological processes, the change of the 
nuclear fuel and related safety analyses, the new 
radiation-monitoring system, the completely new diagnostic 
systems, etc. 
  The first 1,000-MW unit is now 96-percent completed 
regarding 
the actual construction, and 55-percent from the technical 
angle. The second 1,000-MW unit, which is expected to be put 
into operation approximately 18 months after the first, is now 
80-percent completed regarding the construction, and 30-percent 
technically. The total cost of the construction remains at the 
level of 68.8 billion korunas. 
  After all of these changes, the power plant is supposed to 
fully satisfy all West European operational and safety 
standards. At the same time, the JETE management would welcome 
it if the parliament finally adopted the so-called atomic law 
and related legislation. 
  "It is better for us if we know under what conditions we 
operate than if we are to respond post factum to new legislative 
decisions," Vita says. The changes at JETE are supposed to be 
settled legislatively this year in accordance with the 
construction law, and all of the subcontractor transactional 
relations are to be settled as well. The $317-million credit 
approved by the U.S. EXIMBANK has not yet been used. Nothing 
will be done before the signing of the credit contract that is 
to specify the conditions for drawing the funds, including the 
terms for repayment. "It is in our interest that it be done as 
soon as possible," Vita concluded.

  [Text] Jan Rejsek reports on the regular news briefing 
given at the Defense Ministry: 
  [Rejsek] The transformation of the Air Force and Air Defense 
Forces were the topics discussed today. Major General Pavel 
Strubl, Air Force and Air Defense inspector, said that success 
had been attained in fulfilling the basic objectives. A 
three-tier system of command has been set up in the Air Force 
and Air Defense Forces. Thus, there is the Air Force and Air 
Defense headquarters, which is a body of the chief of General 
Staff. There is also the 3d Tactical Air Force Corps and the 
4th Air Defense Corps, which are the operational levels 
[operacni stupne], and, last, there are the Air Force and Air 
Defense units, which are tactical factors [takticke prvky]. 
  This year will be the most complex period for these two 
bodies. Just for illustration: The numbers of aviation 
equipment in use will be radically reduced. Seventy-seven 
combat aircraft, 11 combat helicopters, 20 training aircraft, 
and other equipment will be discarded. Compared to the present, 
this amounts on the whole to a 30.6-percent reduction. There 
will also be similar changes in the Air Defense Forces. 
  Newsmen learned from the information service that 11 
inspections verifying the organizational structure and 81 
inspections checking the elimination of superfluous equipment 
took place on our territory from 1 January 1993 until 1 March 
[no year as heard]. What is pleasing is that the inspections 
confirmed the responsible attitude of the Czech Republic to the 
fulfillment of (?an agreement) in all spheres.

<F P=106> [Article by Vaclav Proks: "Ukrainian Power Plants Need Skoda </F>
Nuclear Engineering Products"] 
  [Text] The representatives of the Skoda Jaderne 
strojirenstvi (Skoda Nuclear Engineering) company recently 
signed a contract to deliver to Ukraine the first major shipment 
worth more than 60 million korunas. The draft contract also 
deals with the security of the payment. The product concerned 
is compact containers for spent fuel pools at the Rivne nuclear 
power plant. According to the company director, Vaclav 
Lobovsky, Ukraine has expressed an interest in purchasing $150 
million worth of nuclear equipment from Skoda Jaderne 
strojirenstvi over the next five to eight years. Cooperation is 
subject to the complex solution to the problem of payments. 
According to Lobovsky, there is the possibility of barter, the 
trade for Ukrainian electricity or perhaps some other goods. 
  "Ukraine is trying to reduce its undesirable dependence on 
Russian monopoly suppliers, whose products allegedly are not of 
as high quality as ours. Cost advantages are losing 
attractiveness," Lobovsky claims. 
  Ukraine has the largest number of AVER 1000 [Water-Moderated 
Water-Cooled Power Reactor] reactors (10 in operation and four 
under construction). Only nuclear power plants are economically 
capable of producing electric power in Ukraine. Skoda Jaderne 
strojirenstvi introduced itself already in November by 
successfully completing a one-year test run at the Ukrainian 
power plant of its own modernized inching drive [krokovy pohon] 
for the reactor, in which even the Russians expressed interest. 
  Ukraine is now beginning to replace its outdated control and 
security systems. Ukrainian nuclear power plants are therefore 
most interested in Skoda's inching drives, including 
electronics, compact grids [kompaktni mrize], hermetic cable 
bushing, and maintenance inspections, which Skoda allegedly 
offers at a price 10 times lower than Siemens, for instance. 
Ukraine is also deciding now from whom to purchase spent fuel 
containers. Skoda Jaderne strojirenstvi is not without chances. 
So far, it has been producing them under a German license, but, 
as early as in September, it will introduce its own container 
prototype, which could become, according to Lobovsky, the most 
promising product of Skoda Plzen.

  [Text] Tirana, March 28 (BTA) -- The formal visit to 
Albania by Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov will 
give an impetus to bilateral relations. This observation was 
made at the talks between Daskalov and his Albanian counterpart 
Alfred Serreqi. Daskalov was also received by parliament leader 
Petar Arbnori and Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi. He held 
talks with the leader of the foreign policy committee of the 
Albanian Parliament. 
  No disputes exist between Bulgaria and Albania. The two 
countries value their poltical dialogue and wish to complete 
building the legal basis of their relations which would further 
promote trade and economic cooperation. Bulgaria and Albania 
intend to take part in building an East-West transport corridor 
between the Adriatic and the Black Sea. 
  The sides agreed the promotion of bilateral relations has a 
positive impact on strengthening trust in the Balkans. Bulgaria 
and Albania are interested in a political settlement to the 
crisis in Bosnia and the whole of former Yugoslavia. They 
support the international effort to restore peace and stability 
in the Balkans.

  [Text] Tirana, March 29 (ATA) -- Albania and Bulgaria 
expressed their readiness for the further promotion of the 
bilateral cooperation in all the fields and similar opinions for 
the resolution of the crisis in the region. Ministers Serreqi 
and Daskalov agreed on the extension of joint contacts at all 
levels for a great economic-trade cooperation, the protection 
and encouragement of investments and further promotion of 
cooperation in the context of the Black Sea agreement. Among 
the fields of cooperation were transport, trade, education, and 
culture. Ministers Serreqi and Daskalov also agreed on an 
interparliamentarian cooperation, removal of double taxation and 
relations between the academies of sciences and chambers of 
commerce of the two countries. 
  Mr. Daskalov asked from the Albanian party that Albania be a 
free trade zone for Bulgaria like some other countries, and the 
opening of an exhibition with Bulgarian products in Tirana. 
This will serve the promotion of trade cooperation between the 
two countries. They also discussed the possibility of 
constructing a gas pipeline which will pass across Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], to supply 
Albania with gas. 
  Regarding the situation in the region, the two parties had 
similar opinions for the solution of the crisis and the possible 
threat of the extension of the conflict in the Balkans. Mr. 
Serreqi and Daskalov supported the latest Croatian-Bosnian 
agreement. They considered as fundamental element the Kosova 
factor and added that the embargo against Serbia must not be 
lifted. 
  Both parties supported the role of the peace-keeping forces 
in the former Republic of Macedonia and underlined the need of 
the international observers in Kosova as well. Mr. Serreqi 
confirmed once more the Albanian point of view that the 
relations with the Macedonian state will be conditioned with the 
observation of the rights of the Albanians living in Macedonia.

  [Text] Tirana, March 28 (ATA) -- The foreign minister of 
Albania, Alfred Serreqi, met yesterday with his Danish 
counterpart, Niels Helveg Petersen. 
  Albanian-Danish talks mainly focused on the development of 
the bilateral relations and the situation in our region. Mr. 
Serreqi informed the Danish foreign minister of the need of the 
Albanian economy for foreign investments, the facilities created 
by Albanian new legislation and urged him to lift the double 
taxation. "We are for a wide bilateral cooperation especially 
at this important moment of the reform and at the difficult 
geopolitical situation in the Balkan region," Mr. Serreqi said. 
  "It is our privilege to contribute to your small democratic 
country in this difficult situation," the Danish foreign 
minister, Petersen, told Mr. Serreqi. Mr. Petersen emphasized 
that "We should try to find out the fields for a fruitful 
bilateral cooperation." 
  The two foreign ministers agreed to start the cooperation 
between Albania and Denmark in the agriculture, tourism and 
culture. As Mr. Petersen said, Denmark agrees to start and big 
projects with the aim of assisting Albania. 
  The Albanian party presented its views about the recent 
events in the region and it especially appreciated the agreement 
between the Croatians and Muslims reached in Washington. The 
Kosova question was one of the main topics of the talks in which 
the Albanian party reiterated its approach in defence of the 
rights of the Albanian population in this area. 
  Mr. Petersen condemned the violation of the human rights in 
Kosova and said that the presence of the international observers 
there is indispensable. Mr. Petersen said that a solution for 
the Kosova problem requires a greater internationalization of 
this important question. 
  In regard to the Albanians living in The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia and their rights, Mr. Petersen said that 
in some previous meetings they had presented to the Macedonian 
party the concern of the Albanian Government concerning this 
question.

  [Text] Bratislava, March 29 (CTK) -- Slovakia must face 
growing problems, but the situation in general is better than 
anticipated by many people, President Michal Kovac said in an 
interview with ASSOCIATED PRESS on Tuesday [29 March]. 
  Kovac admitted that Slovakia, which is moving towards 
democracy and strengthening human rights, has been often 
criticized by foreign observers in these fields. "However, we 
have confirmed that democratic institutions are working in 
Slovakia," said Kovac, hinting at the recent, formally 
democratic removal of Vladimir Meciar' cabinet. 
  "The absence of political ethics" constitutes a large 
portion 
of the whole problem, Kovac stated. The political parties of 
which none has absolute majority in parliament have not able to 
arrive at a compromise and to lead the country quietly to the 
independent, market economy. As a result, during the 15 months 
of independent Slovakia foreign investments have been radically 
curbed and privatization has slowed down, Kovac said. 
  He expressed the conviction that Slovakia had passed the 
worst and the results for 1994 would confirm this. "A number of 
experts predicted the collapse in Slovakia by one year after 
independence, but this has not occurred," he stressed. 
  Regarding Meciar, whose removal he had initiated in 
parliament, Kovac stated that "he was a source of political 
instability and confrontation between the individual groups." 
Meciar's fall was caused by his inability to cooperate with 
other politicians. 
  Kovac also admitted that the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS), among whose founding fathers he was, can return 
to power after the autumn elections. He noted that it would 
hardly be possible without the assistance of other parties, 
adding that in such a case "the new premier must not be 
necessarily just Mr Meciar." 
  The new government must revive economic reforms and ensure 
observation of human rights in order to increase the credibility 
of the country in the eyes of the West and ensure the influx of 
economic assistance. 
  Kovac refused demands by some ethnic Hungarian 
representatives for a measure of territorial autonomy. He 
supported the first steps of the current government to ease the 
relations with neighboring Hungary which were kept strained by 
Meciar due to the alleged territorial demands by Budapest. 
  "Both countries must contribute to stability in region," 
Kovac concluded.

  [Text] In a statement to the press after meeting today 
with Romanian President Ion Iliescu, Russian Defense Minister 
General Pavel Grachev said that he held talks with Prime 
Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and that their talks focused on 
economic issues. The sides agreed that relations between our 
countries have not reached the desired level and our countries 
have not made complete use of their potential. These relations 
can be improved and expanded, something that can be achieved 
through the meeting of the two prime ministers, that is the 
prime minister of Romania and of Russia, that will take place in 
the near future. 
  With Romania's president I held only a political dialogue, 
Pavel Grachev said, noting that he informed the Romanian 
president about the internal political situation in Russia, the 
division of political forces, and the actions taken by the 
president and the government to find solutions to the internal 
and foreign policy problems and to the problems of reform. 
  President Iliescu informed the guest about the domestic and 
foreign activity of the political leadership in Romania. The 
sides reached the conclusion that our countries have many 
similar ways to ensure their development. 
  Iliescu declared that Romania wishes to achieve a closer 
cooperation with Russia and is expecting a meeting with Boris 
Yeltsin, a meeting that he hopes will take place still this 
year. Russia's position is identical, namely to strengthen ties 
with Romania, which diminished at a certain point. 
  Grachev declared that he held talks with President Ion 
Iliescu on several foreign policy issues, especially about the 
Partnership for Peace with the countries of Western Europe and 
with the United States. 
  The sides reached the conclusion that the partnership should 
be based on the principle of equality, there should be a basis 
for mutual advantage, and all countries in Europe should be 
drawn into this partnership to ensure joint security.

  [Vranjes] According to last night's agreements between Croat

today simply proclaim the federal constitution, but not elect 
the president and vice president of the Federation for a 
transitional period. 
  According to the leadership of the Croatian representatives, 
the election of the president and vice president of the 
Federation has been postponed for one month at most, because the 
Bosniak Muslim side has not agreed to the proposal put forward 
by Croatian representatives, to the effect that the president of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation be a Croatian during the 
transitional period. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, March 29 (TANJUG) -- Vice President of the 
State Duma (lower chamber of Russian parliament) and of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia Aleksandr Vengerovskiy said 
in Belgrade on Tuesday that a military-political alliance should 
be formed between Russia and Yugoslavia, that Russia should 
return to the Balkans and that it supports those peace 
initiatives which really lead to peace in the territory of 
former Yugoslavia. 
  Summing up the impressions and conclusions of the several 
days long visit of the Russian parliamentary delegation, 
Vengerovskiy told a press conference that the sanctions against 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are not necessary. If Europe 
does not understand this, we can do the same thing, already 
tomorrow Europe might be left without Russian gas, Vengerovskiy 
threatened. 
  Vengerovskiy told reporters that he had not had the chance 
to 
find out the official stand of Belgrade on the conclusions 
reached by the Russian delegation during their visit to 
Yugoslavia. 
  Official stands, he added, are interpreted through official 
statements by state organs. When we return to Moscow, we shall 
make a list of proposals, on the basis of what our impressions, 
for further actions which will be assessed not only here but 
also in New York, Vengerovski said in the familiar style of the 
controversial leaders of this Russian party, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  The Russian delegation arrived in Yugoslavia last week at 
the 
invitation of the extra-parliamentrary rightist party, the 
Serbian National Renewal Party. 
  Member of the Committee for Security and Defence, 
independent 
deputy Yevgeniy Fedorov said that serious changes had taken 
place in the Russian Army now, which voted for the 
Liberal-Democratic Party practically 100 percent at the last 
elections. In spirit the army is ready for changes in the 
country's foreign policy, he said, and for military cooperation 
with Yugoslavia. 
  Deputy President of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia 
Valentin Minakhov assessed that the U.N. Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) in former Yugoslavia were there only for appearances' 
sake and were protecting the interests of only one side. 
Minakhov announced that they would raise the question of the 
deployment of Russian troops in Prevlaka, a controversial 
peninsula on the border between the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia and Croatia where UNPROFOR are deployed, because the 
U.N. peace-keepers did not permit the Russian parliamentarians 
to visit Prevlaka. 
  Minakhov also announced that Zhirinovskiy would visit 
Belgrade again in mid-May this year. Serbian National Renewal 
Leader Mirko Jovic, who is host to the Russian delegation, said 
that the main objective of the visit and cooperation with 
Russian parties was to renew old friendships and the military 
alliance with Russia.

  [Text] Warsaw, March 29 (AFP)--The Polish government 
decided Tuesday to make a formal application for EU membership, 
and will propose a negotiation schedule to that end, Polish 
Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski told reporters. 
  Olechowski said that Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak would go 
to Brussels to make the application as soon as the lower house 
of Poland's parliament approves the measure, sometime after 
April 7. 
  Warsaw wants detailed negotiations with the European Union 
to 
begin in 1996 or 1997, finishing before 2000, when Poland could 
become an EU member with a special transitional status. 
  Poland has already signed a "Europe agreement" in 
preparation 
for eventual EU membership.

  [Text] Zagreb, March 30 (AFP) -- Croatia and rebel Krajina 
Serbs agreed on a ceasefire and withdrawal of forces early 
Wednesday [30 March], an official statement said. The ceasefire 
would come into effect April 4, and withdrawal of forces would 
begin the following day, it said. Heavy weapons would be pulled 
back up to 20 kilometres (12 miles) and infantry 1,000 metres on 
each side. 
  The statement was issued after a ceasefire accord was signed 
at the end of negotiations that began Tuesday [29 March] in the 
Russian Embassy here and lasted most of the night. "The parties 
signing this document agree that all armed hostilities between 
the parties should end immediately, and that a ceasefire on all 
contact lines existing between the parties on 29 March 1994 
(...) should be fully respected from 0900 hours 4 April 1994," 
it said. "Not later than 0900 hours 5 April 1994, all indirect 
fire weapons shall be deployed out of range of the Lines of 
Separation: mortars and AA-guns not less than 10 kilometres, 
artillery and tanks not less than 20 kilometres. Not later than 
0900 hours on 8 April 1994, all units on the Contact Line shall 
be separated. The separation will be based on a mutual 
withdrawal not less than 1,000 metres from the Contact Line to 
their respective line of separation." 
  The ceasefire will be monitored by the United Nations 
Protection Force for the former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) and the 
European Union Monitoring Commission, the statement added. The 
talks, brokered by Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin, had resumed 
here Tuesday after a week-long break. The first since the 
conflict erupted two years ago, they had broken off on March 22 
after failing to reach an agreement. The negotiations were aimed 
solely at forging a ceasefire between the two sides, the 
Croatian government and the rebel Serbs who have proclaimed a 
separatist republic, the Serb republic of Krajina (RSK), on 
roughly a quarter of Croatian territory. The spokesman for the 
international conference on the former Yugoslavia, John Mills, 
said earlier the negotiators, armed with 35 detailed maps, were 
working out sector by sector how to pull back their forces from 
the front lines. They were assisted by senior officers of 
UNPROFOR, which intends to send buffer units into the resulting 
no man's land two kilometres (2,000 yards) across.

<F P=106> [Interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Lucie </F>
Weissova in Prague on 29 March--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Weissova] Prime Minister, representatives of 
the coalition parties held yet another meeting yesterday because 
there have been rumors that there are some clashes in the 
coalition. Jan Kalvoda, for instance, said a few days ago that 
he was dissatisfied with the method of communication in the 
coalition. I would like to ask you whether things have cleared 
up after the meeting and whether you reached a consensus on the 
disputed issues. 
  [Klaus] No agreement has been reached because the 
differences 
are not caused by lack of communication. This is simply a rumor 
that is being constantly spread around by someone. The 
differences exist because of differing views, because of 
differing approaches to the various issues we are currently 
facing. Naturally, these differences do not apply to the 95 
percent of matters of everyday importance. 
  The differences lie in several evergreens, so to speak. On 
the one hand, there are the restitution-related issues, and, on 
the other, there is the creation of the senate, a new chamber in 
our parliament. In my view, the need for this chamber is very 
disputable. The third issue is formed by the contentious 
problems related to the regional setup, the issues that stir the 
whole country. 
  Thus our views do indeed differ, and in no case can they be 
related to lack of communication. 
  [Weissova] Let us return to your recent visit to Finland. In 
your own words, one of the experiences you brought with you from 
there was that the admission into the European Union does not 
need to be a cure all, and that, especially at the beginning, it 
might bring certain disadvantages. Does this mean that you 
share with the so-called Euroskeptics their worries about the 
Brussels bureaucracy, which, by the way, is formed mainly by 
people from governing European Socialist parties? 
  [Klaus] [passage omitted] This bureaucracy is not a 
fundamental problem of the European Community. It is, rather, a 
complementary problem that is above the fundamental problem. In 
my view, the fundamental question is something else: what the 
concept of European integration is, to what degree it really 
means a general opening of various obstacles, movements of 
people, ideas, goods, money, and various other things all over 
Europe--which we support wholeheartedly--and to what extent it 
is an attempt to force upon people a specific ideology, specific 
unity, specific compulsory common solutions, and thousands of 
other things. This is not Euroskeptism; this is Eurorealism. 
This is simply searching for a sensible social setup in Europe. 
I always say that the important thing is not whether there will 
be 12 or 16 or 20 countries, but what system of relations 
between the individual and the state will prevail in this 
situation.

<F P=106> [Article by Dan Andronic and Radu Tudor: "The Head of the </F>
Counterintelligence Division of the Romanian Intelligence 
Service Is in Possession of Documents That Can Lead to Virgil 
Magureanu's Dismissal"] 
  [Text] A short while ago, immediately after President Ion 
Iliescu's departure on his Asian tour, Virgil Magureanu, 
director of the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI], made a 
surprising move: He dismissed Major General Gheorghe 
Diaconescu, head of the SRI's Counterintelligence Division. 
  Although absolute silence was kept on this subject, 
EVENIMENTUL ZILEI soon learned the real reason for Maj. Gen. 
Diaconescu's dismissal. 
  According to information we have been able to obtain thus 
far, in the wake of certain operative actions carried out by the 
Counterintelligence Division, Maj. Gen. Diaconescu put together 
certain intelligence files according to which Maj. Gen. 
Magureanu and his first deputy, Maj. Gen. Victor Marcu, were 
involved in monkey business. Although he proceeded in 
accordance with the law and notified the Department of Military 
Magistracies through Maj. Gen. Mihai Ulpiu Popa-Cherecheanu, 
deputy prosecutor general of the General Magistracy of the 
Supreme Court of Justice, Maj. Gen. Diaconescu found himself 
nonetheless dismissed. Mihai Ulpiu Popa-Cherecheanu did nothing 
else but to seal the filing box with the compromising documents 
against Virgil Magureanu. 
<H5>  Virgil Magureanu Launched a Diversion: "The Cristea Case" </H5>
  The latest data obtained by EVENIMENTUL ZILEI show that 
Virgil Magureanu launched an obnoxious diversion to divert 
attention from the "Diaconescu case" to the "Cristea case." We 
would like to recall that Maj. Gen. Dumitru Cristea, rector of 
the Higher Institute for Information Studies and deputy SRI 
director, was accused of immorality, that is of having a sexual 
affair with a former female student. 
  The "Cristea case" was presented in detail by Virgil 
Magureanu to the parliamentary commission for supervising the 
SRI activity and was reported with suspect promptness by all 
newspapers, who were supplied an abundance of information on the 
topic. The entire fabric of the scandal involving Maj.Gen. 
Dumitru Cristea was construed in accordance with the classic 
rules of disinformation. 
<H3>  The Sealing of Maj. Gen. Diaconescu's Filing Cabinet Was 
Done in Secret </H3>
  The aim of all these efforts to divert attention from the 
compromising files on Maj. Gen. Magureanu was to guide the 
research of the journalists, of the members of the Parliament's 
SRI Supervisory Commission, and of the members of the 
parliamentary defense commissions into a totally different 
direction, namely the alleged sexual affair of Virgil 
Magureanu's deputy with a former female student. 
  In reality, the tension within the SRI is caused by the 
existence of Maj. Gen. Diaconescu's sealed filing cabinet, which 
contains some extremely compromising files that would lead to 
Maj. Gen Magureanu's immediate dismissal by Ion Iliescu. 
  In this respect, the efforts made by Virgil Magureanu to 
divert attention elsewhere appear extremely logical. 
  It is worth mentioning that Maj. Gen. Gheorghe Diaconescu's 
dismissal and the sealing of his filing cabinet were done in 
great secrecy, without prior notification to the SRI Supervisory 
Commission. One can easily assume that in the time which has 
elapsed since then, the documents have disappeared without a 
trace. Normally, the members of the SRI Supervisory Commission 
should have been notified in advance and its chairman, Senator 
Vasile Vacaru, should have been present at the sealing of the 
filing cabinet. 
<H5>  Maj. Gen. Diaconescu Is Being Subjected to Great Pressure </H5>
  Although it is not the first time that we write about the 
implications of the "Diaconescu case," the former head of the 
Counterintelligence Division has not been yet heard; instead, he 
is being subjected to very strong pressure from Virgil Magureanu. 
  Anyone who has ever read an espionage book cannot possibly 
understand why Maj. Gen. Diaconescu's physical and psychological 
protection has not yet been secured up to this date. This 
omission can be easily explained if one considers the hypothesis 
that several persons, much more important than Maj. Gen. 
Magureanu, are involved in this scandal. 
  The immediate hearing of Maj. Gen. Diaconescu by all 
relevant 
bodies, including by the parliament's Defense Commissions, and 
the placing of the former chief of the Counterintelligence 
Division under effective protection are essential for the 
elucidation of this case.

  [Text] The two rapporteurs of the Council of Europe, 
Friedrich Koenig and Gunnar Janssen, who are currently visiting 
Bucharest, have so far held three meetings with the 
representatives of the UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in 
Romania], the Romanies' minority, and with representatives of 
the National Council for Ethnic Minorities. 
  Our correspondent Dan Preda informed us that the 
representatives of the UDMR made numerous critical remarks about 
the Government of Romania and accused it of having an attitude 
of duplicity and of lacking any real political will to solve the 
recommendations formulated for Romania upon our country's 
admittance to the Council of Europe. The UDMR representatives 
mentioned that, in the six months that have elapsed since the 
day when Romania joined the Council of Europe, no program for 
fulfilling the recommendations has been drafted or implemented. 
Likewise, the representatives of the UDMR affirmed that certain 
parties or political circles, both in the parliament as well as 
at the level of local administration in Romania, are still 
showing an attitude of intolerance and xenophobia. The UDMR 
representatives also criticized the attitude of the mayor of 
Cluj-Napoca Municipality and affirmed that he started 
implementing new discriminatory measures. The prefects were 
accused of taking abusive measures disfavoring the Hungarian 
minority as far as the bilingual signs and inscriptions are 
concerned. 
  The UDMR leaders also mentioned that the parliament approved 
certain discriminatory articles or laws, and as an example they 
mentioned the law on war veterans and the police law. 
  During the talks with the Council of Europe rapporteurs, the 
UDMR representatives mentioned that the pardoning decree signed 
by Romania's president, quote, only partially satisfied a 
written request of the UDMR, but since the act itself took place 
just before the arrival of the Council of Europe rapporteurs, it 
does not show a consistent policy aimed at implementing the 
recommendations of the Council of Europe, unquote. 
  Senator Gyorgy Frunda said that the presidential decree was 
based on ethnic criteria and several members of the Executive 
Committee of the Romanian Communist Party of Hungarian origin 
have remained imprisoned. He also draw Mr. Koenig's attention 
to the fact that Pal Cseresznyes, condemned after the March 1990 
events in Targu Mures, although not guilty, has still not been 
pardoned. 
  Continuing their discussions, the rapporteurs met with 
representatives of Romanies and discussed the problems faced by 
this minority. During the talks, the Romanies discussed ways in 
which the court of justice approached cases that referred to the 
devastation of Romanies' dwellings in some counties. 
  Finally, the two rapporteurs held a meeting with the 
representatives of the National Council for Minorities. Viorel 
Hrebenciuc, general secretary of the government, said that the 
law on minorities is in its final stage of drafting and the 
government will forward it to the parliament the moment it is 
ready. Mr. Hrebenciuc also said that he hopes that Romania will 
ratify the convention for human rights by 15 April. 
  During the same talks, the representative of the (?Italian) 
minority affirmed that any ethnic minority has the right of veto 
in discussions that refer to that minority's own problems, and 
this does not justify any withdrawal from the Council of 
Minorities. The withdrawal of the Hungarian representatives 
from this council was considered as an example of lack of 
patience in finding solutions to certain problems. The head of 
the council, Viorel Hrebenciuc, also said that the establishment 
of this council shows the interest and political will to solve 
the problems of minorities in our country, and this is why the 
council has asked for a higher budget for this year than for the 
last year, our correspondent Dan Preda also informed us.

  [Text] The two rapporteurs for the Council of Europe, 
Friedrich Koenich and Gunnar Jansson, met for an hour this 
afternoon with the representatives of the Democratic Party [PD] 
at the headquarters of the Senate. According to our 
correspondent, PD President Petre Roman said that with Romania's 
admission to the Council of Europe, the executive authority 
assumed certain commitments that it has so far failed to fully 
resolve. One of the major failings is the lack of independence 
of the judiciary. Another prominent PD leader, Victor Babiuc, 
said that there are extremist and chauvinist parties in many 
democratic countries in Europe but that in none of them does the 
executive rely on such parties, as is the case with Romania. 
  Continuing their meetings at Senate headquarters, the two 
Council of Europe rapporteurs met in turn with the 
representatives of the Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR], the 
Greater Romania Party [PRM], and the Socialist Party of Labor 
[PSM]. At the start of the meeting with the PUNR, Gheorghe 
Funar, president of that political grouping, said that the 
minorities should be indeed treated with goodwill, but he added 
that the complaints and memoranda of the Democratic Union of 
Hungarians in Romania [UDMR] are artificial, being aimed and 
directed against the Romanian state, since a certain part of the 
Hungarian minority is acting on the basis of suggestions from 
abroad, whose aim is to destroy the Romanian state, which is 
protecting this minority. Another PUNR leader, Valer Suian, 
said that the reports, complaints, or other auxiliary documents 
sent to the Council of Europe should first be made known to the 
government or Parliament. PUNR official Adrian Motiu talked 
about certain aspects of Romanian political life, with 
particular reference to the UDMR, which he considered as a party 
based on ethnic and not political considerations. 
  During the meetings with the PRM representatives, Corneliu 
Vadim Tudor, president of that political grouping, agreed that 
the minorities have the right to study in their mother tongue, 
but said that this cannot yet apply to university education, 
since a minority student nevertheless attends higher education 
in order to become useful to Romanian society. The PRM 
representatives said that they understand this desire of the 
Hungarian minority to study in their mother tongue, but their 
request is not for a right, but rather for a privilege, since 
Romania has at least other 10 minorities that have not asked for 
such a thing. 
  In his speech, PSM President Ilie Verdet expressed concern 
over the revival of violence and of racist-nationalist movements 
in Romania. In his turn, [PSM Vice President] Adrian Paunescu 
said that certain requirements of the Council of Europe are 
being used by certain political forces in Romania against the 
stability of the Romanian state. Because the time allocated for 
this meeting was exceeded, Gunnar Jansson asked the PSM 
representatives to present their other comments in writing. 
  After this meeting, the two rapporteurs had a brief meeting 
with the representatives of the Agrarian Democratic Party of 
Romania [PDAR]. 
  The last point on today's agenda of the two Council of 
Europe 
rapporteurs was their reception by the president of the two 
chambers of Romania's Parliament. During the meeting Jansson 
and Koenig emphasized the importance of Romania's observation of 
the commitments assumed, since they contribute to the country's 
political stability, international recognition, and the 
attraction of foreign capital. In their reply, [Senate 
President] Oliviu Gherman and [Chamber of Deputies Speaker] 
Adrian Nastase said that Romania will choose the best pace for 
the implementation of the commitments assumed, so that their 
solution will be a real one, in full accordance with Romanian 
legislation. 
  According to our correspondent Dan Preda, the two 
rapporteurs' series of meetings will continue tomorrow morning 
with the leaders of the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR].

  [Text] Friedrich Koenig and Gunnar Jansson, rapporteurs of 
the Council of Europe, met today with the representatives of the 
Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. On this occasion 
Florin Radulescu Botica, PDSR secretary and head of the Romanian 
parliamentary delegation to the Council of Europe, reiterated 
the political will and interest of both the PDSR and the 
government in ensuring the fulfillment of the commitments 
assumed by Romania upon admittance to the Council of Europe. 
The main target is the ratification by Parliament of the 
European Human Rights Convention, which will take place by 15 
April at the latest. In his turn, Gunnar Jansson said this term 
of six months is quite extraordinary, if Romania ratifies the 
European Human Rights Convention by 15 April. Mr. Koenig left 
the meeting for a few minutes to inform the German and Austrian 
press -- as he later told us -- of President Ion Iliescu's act 
of clemency in pardoning certain detainees, an act that, 
according to Mr. Koenig, has been well received in Austria and 
Germany as they celebrate the Holy Week, according to the 
Catholic calendar. 
  The next meeting of the Council of Europe rapporteurs was 
with the representatives of the Democratic Convention [CDR], 
whose leader, Emil Constantinescu, reiterated the CDR's 
contribution to Romania's admittance to the Council of Europe, 
regarded as a goal in the national interest. Koenig said that 
the CDR's position has played a decisive role in ensuring a 
majority vote in favor of Romania's admittance. Emil 
Constantinescu referred to several aspects that he considered to 
be in dissonance with the commitments assumed. Among other 
things, he mentioned the government's sabotaging of the local 
administration, where the opposition holds an important stake; 
the need to ensure the dependence of the justice branch; and 
government corruption. The CDR leader said that the freedom of 
the press is total and real, with the pressures applied being 
generally of an economic nature. Emil Constantinescu emphasized 
the objective stance of the national radio station and the 
television's dependence on the power. At the end of the 
meeting, Dinu Patriciu, president of Liberal Party-1993, handed 
over to the two rapporteurs a memorandum from his political 
grouping, whereby it considers itself deprived of a rightful 
place in the parliamentary delegation to the Council of Europe. 
  The rapporteurs of the Council of Europe met with the 
leaders 
of the parliamentary groups from the Senate and the Chamber of 
Deputies.

  [Text] Today is the last day of meetings that the 
rapporteurs for Romania of the Council of Europe are having in 
our country. 
  The first meeting this morning took place with members of 
the 
bar of lawyers and then with representatives of the Association 
of Former Political Detainees, the Civic Alliance, and of the 
Associations of Former Revolutionaries. After 1030 the 
rapporteurs met with leaders of nongovernmental organizations in 
the area of human rights. 
  These first meetings permitted the representatives of those 
organizations to brief the rapporteurs on their activities and 
on the way the commitments that our country assumed when it was 
admitted to the Council of Europe are being fulfilled. 
  Asked by Friedrich Koenig which of these commitments would 
be 
given primary importance, Senator Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu 
emphasized that they were human rights and political rights. At 
the same time, Ticu Dumitrescu criticized President Ion 
Iliescu's attitude and the attitude by the majority party, 
which, in his opinion, after Romania's admission to the Council 
of Europe, prove that they do not want to renounce the monopoly 
of power. 
  Ana Blandiana handed a letter to the rapporteurs whereby the 
Council of Europe is informed about the Civic Alliance's 
intention to set up an institute of studies on totalitarianism 
under the aegis of the Council of Europe. 
  Nicolae Stefanescu-Draganesti, LADO [League for the Defense 
of Human Rights] president, demanded the results of the 
investigations on the 1990 miners' incursion when, in his 
opinion, hundreds of people were killed. 
  The meeting between the rapporteurs and the justice 
minister, 
the interior minister, the prosecutor general, and the president 
of the Supreme Justice Court ended shortly before 1300. On this 
occasion, Justice Minister Gavril Iosif Chiuzbaian presented the 
progress of the reform process in this ministry and announced 
that by 13 August 1994 all judges will be granted tenure. 
  Minister of interior Doru Ioan Taracila, presented the stage 
of the reform process in the ministry he headed affirming that 
1,654 people who have committed violations have been removed 
from the police so far, and that the military magistracy has 
been notified about other 320 such cases of employees of the 
Ministry. He also said that he has not noted any cases of 
censorship by the police or cases when correspondence was 
opened. He emphasized that, in the shortest time possible, he 
would provide the rapporteurs with information on cases of 
censorship reported to him, and that he would take measures to 
punish all the guilty people.

  [Text] The Council of Europe rapporteurs held a news 
conference in Bucharest yesterday to mark the conclusion of the 
visit to our country of the two diplomats, Friedrich Koenig and 
Gunnar Jansson. 
  In the opening of the news conference Koenig made a few 
remarks, mentioning that he would like to elaborate a report 
that should be as balanced as possible. He also said that a 
special role in Romania's admittance as a full member of the 
Council of Europe was played not merely by the report he 
elaborated after his previous visit, but also by the 
constructive position of the Democratic Convention of Romania 
[CDR] and the ethnic minorities. Koenig emphasized the fact 
that the favorable vote cast by the [Council of Europe] 
parliamentarians proved that they have confidence in the 
Romanian reform processes and that the goal of his current visit 
is to verify the way in which our country is complying with the 
pledges it made. Koenig also said that this is not an 
exceptional procedure, but rather one that was begun with 
Estonia and Slovakia and now continues with Romania. The 
speaker added that he did not come to Bucharest together with 
Jansson to teach Romania what to do, but rather to lend our 
country a helping hand in the democratization process. 
  Referring to the ethnic minority issue, the two rapporteurs 
outlined the fact that this issue is not specific merely to 
Romania, as a majority of the Council of Europe member countries 
are facing the same problem, and emphasized that the observance 
of ethnic minority rights is part of the observance of human 
rights. They also mentioned that according to the head of the 
Romanian delegation to the Council of Europe, by 15 April 
Romania will ratify the European Convention on Human Rights. 
The rapporteurs also mentioned that fact that the citizens 
belonging to ethnic minority groups have to be loyal to the 
country the citizens of which they are and to fulfill their 
duties, while the respective states have to offer them proper 
conditions to maintain their ethnic identity. They also 
assessed that Romania can play a very constructive role as a 
point of stability on the Balkans and that our country's wish to 
join the European family [of states] ought to be encouraged. 
  Yesterday Gunnar Jansson also met with the persons attending 
the preparatory course designed to train experts in ethnic 
minority issues and interethnic relations, which has been 
organized by the Council for Ethnic Minorities with the support 
of the European Center for Ethnic Issues and Social 
Communication Studies of the Romanian Academy. Jansson 
appreciated that course, asserting that it is unique throughout 
Europe. He also appreciated the fact that a national committee 
was set up to fight racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and 
intolerance, a body that was established following the 
recommendations of the 1993 October Vienna conference of the 
Council of Europe.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by Kalina Stancheva on the Council of </F>
Ministers meeting in Sofia on 31 March -- live] 
  [Text] Regarding the first item on the agenda of the 
cabinet meeting today, the number one topic this week, Finance 
Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov said: We expect that in early April 
a countershock will occur when the producers and merchants 
restock with raw materials and goods. He admitted the 
possibility of delays in supplies, which will restrict demand 
for foreign currency because of the fact that firms will be 
starting to pay their taxes and salaries, so that people will 
start selling foreign currency. 
  According to Stoyan Aleksandrov, the measures adopted by the 
Bulgarian National Bank [BNB] to limit liquidity will have an 
effect, as will the start of the checks on the 3,000 foreign 
currency exchange bureaus, 260 brokerage houses, and about 50 
banks. [passage omitted] 
  Next week the finance minister will ask parliament to amend 
the Law on Speculation, to reduce the speculative raising of 
prices for basic goods. Incidentally, today he also said he 
wanted to extend the list of basic goods monitored by the 
government, but the government decided first to seek the 
agreement of its partners in the National Council for Trilateral 
Cooperation. 
  The government also made changes in the membership of the 
Interagency Council on Problems of the Military-Industrial 
Complex, appointing different deputy ministers of industry and 
trade, namely Racho Petrov and Dencho Georgiev, to replace 
Yordan Bochev and Stanimir Barzashki respectively.

  [Text] Violations of the foreign exchange regulations are 
taking place on a colossal, massive scale, Professor Todor 
Vulchev, governor of the Bulgarian National Bank [BNB], 
announced yesterday. The foreign exchange bureaus will be 
closed down and finance houses will lose their licenses, he 
claimed. He was referring to finance houses that were dealing 
without permits. 
  About 80 of the almost 200 finance houses are operating 
without licenses. The prosecution service is supposed to 
intervene, but in the absence of any sound, stable 
administration and police apparatus it is difficult to implement 
penal sanctions, Vulchev claimed. 
  Of the 1,253 companies that have registered currency 
exchange 
bureaus, only 646 have supplied figures on the scale of their 
foreign exchange operations completed in 1993, as required by 
the BNB. If the others fail to present the information by 15 
April, we will take away their licenses, Vulchev told the 
journalists. 
  Vulchev said that a major violation of the foreign exchange 
controls had been established in a large state bank. No 
documents were available for 50 percent of its forex operations. 
The head of the bank's legal department claimed that he had not 
heard of Council of Ministers Decree No. 15 that controls forex 
operations in Bulgaria. The bank in question had transferred a 
considerable amount of money abroad for a client who had sold 
real estate. The fine for violations of this kind is up to 
500,000 leva. Experts point out that the Finance Ministry can 
impose such a fine by ministerial decree.

<F P=106> [Krasimir Tsigularov commentary: "Yet Another Own Goal"] </F>
  [Text] The Bulgarian Danube ports are no longer expected 
to handle petrol and liquid fuels for export. Such goods shall 
no longer be transported on the Danube. The ban not only 
applies to ferryboat transports. In this manner, our country is 
formally complying with the restricted Yugoembargo. This is how 
Bulgaria itself is actually erecting another barrier obstructing 
its already weakened foreign economic relations. In addition to 
this, our country is doing so while perfectly realizing that it 
cannot expect any advantage whatsoever from its action. There 
is even more: Quite a few Bulgarian companies that benefited 
from the cheap river transport faciilities for re-exporting oil 
products are going to complain. With one stroke they are all 
practically ostracized as embargo violators. It is not 
difficult to forecast that the elimination of the Bulgarian 
competition would be very profitable for some foreign companies 
-- simply because any vacuum in international trade is easy to 
fill. 
  The candid enthusiasm with which we recently joined the 
embargo against Iraq led to losses that are expected to affect 
our economy for a long time in the future. Hundreds of millions 
of dollars have vanished somewhere in the course of Desert 
Storm, as a result of unfulfilled business deals and more than 
$1 billion were lost as a result of Iraq's unpaid debts toward 
our country. It appeared at one time that we would be placed at 
the end of the queue of those waiting for compensation in 
connection with the Iraqi embargo, but even this was forgotten 
with time and we never got anything. 
  The act of submissively joining the Yugo-embargo cut off the 
main route of Bulgarian exports to the West. Transit corridors 
through Serbia have been opening repeatedly over the last three 
months, but not even one truck has passed through them. As far 
as Turkey is concerned, it is about to further complicate the 
procedure for the transport of oil products and petrol through 
the straits, after the tragic incident in the Bosphorus. Gas 
deliveries through Ukrainian territory are frequently causing 
concern because of the controversies between Russia and the 
Ukraine, and also because of unsettled accounts. As things are 
going, we might nostalgically remember some Bulgarian magicians 
who used to set fire to water and transform it into fuel. 
  After the Danube was closed for petrol barges, no one is 
talking about compensations. However, even if anyone should 
mention them, he should immediately remember the lessons of the 
past. It is interesting to learn, whether anyone knows that 
compensations should be better sought before one has inflicted 
his own goal against himself. After we have voluntarily fallen 
into our own trap, it is difficult to find volunteers willing to 
rescue us.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Croatian National Security Adviser </F>
Hrvoje Sarinic by an unidentified correspondent in Zagreb--live] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Our guest this evening is Mr. Hrvoje 
Sarinic, a man who early this morning signed a cease-fire accord 
with the Serbs from the UNPA [UN Protected Areas] on behalf of 
the delegation of the Republic of Croatia. Mr. Sarinic, in 
specific terms, what is Croatia gaining by this accord? 
  [Sarinic] First, if you permit me, let me correct you. I 
have 
not signed only the accord, but also 35 maps attached to the 
accord, without which the accord would not function. I will now 
answer your question. 
  By this accord, Croatia has taken the first step on the road 
to peace and the normalization of relations within the borders 
of the Republic of Croatia; how brief, but how important at the 
same time. For, after four years of all that has happened, it is 
obvious that everyone--all Croats and even those in 
Krajina--have awaited this accord with great impatience. 
  The accord was not a goal in itself. It is merely the first 
step in the process that will take us toward full normalization 
of relations, but without which the next two stages--i.e., talks 
about normalizing economic relations and, eventually, about a 
political solution--would not be possible at all if we had 
failed in our first task, which was ending hostilities. 
  [Correspondent] What exactly is meant by the cessation of 
hostilities? Many accords have been signed so far. Many 
agreements have been reached, but this one seems to be a 
watershed. 
  [Sarinic] This one is obviously a watershed for two 
fundamental reasons. The first is that the entire international 
community is a guarantor behind this accord. You saw that the 
negotiations were attended by representatives of the two 
greatest powers in the world: a personal envoy of President 
Clinton, a personal envoy of President Yeltsin, a representative 
of the European Community and, finally, a UN representative. In 
other words, the creme de la creme of world politics was present 
here. This in itself is a guarantee that the accord will be 
implemented on the ground. 
  The second fundamental reason is that the accord is 
technically a very good one. I will not go into all technical 
details of the agreement. However, I can describe three 
important stages: 
  The freezing of all forces in the 20-km long corridor, i.e. 
10 km on either side, begins on 4 April. This is followed by 
the withdrawal of all heavy weapons on both sides. The weapons 
are to be placed under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] control 
at such a distance that they can no longer be used for shelling 
the combat lines that had been shelled during the hostilities. 
  Finally, the third, and not the least important reason, is 
that the infantry will be separated. Each side will withdraw by 
one kilometer, and UNPROFOR will move into the vacated area. 
For instance, there will be no technical means if either side 
wanted to continue the hostilities since, as I have said, the 
heavy weaponry will be under control and would be too far to be 
of any use, while, on the other side, UNPROFOR will be deployed 
between the two infantries. 
  [Correspondent] What is UNPROFOR authorized to do in case 
the 
agreement is not implemented? 
  [Sarinic] A number of measures have been envisaged. There 
will be mixed commissions. There will be clauses that will 
specify what to do in case of any incidents. Neither side must 
respond in case of incidents. Mixed commissions will meet 
immediately, report the incidents, and there will be some sort 
of a legal mechanism that will prevent any further escalation. 
  [Correspondent] Does the Croatian side have any objections 
to 
negotiators on the other side? 
  [Sarinic] I would not like to say it here. Of course, there 
have been sparks, and specific problems have arisen during the 
talks, but we have resolved them quite successfully. We had 
another problem though, not only with the other side but also 
with UNPROFOR's status and the way in which UNPROFOR will be 
involved in the implementation of the agreement itself. In 
order to feel more comfortable--if I can say it that 
way--UNPROFOR wanted to have absolute control and absolute 
freedom of movement--absolute control of everything in our 
territory. Of course, we agree regarding all those aspects 
where control is necessary for the agreement to be implemented 
and to be effective. They had our full cooperation in this, but 
we could not allow certain things, i.e. that Croatian territory 
should become some sort of a colony. Our stand was clear in 
this respect. We will cooperate efficiently [as heard]; 
however, we attach enormous importance to our independence, and 
we do not want Croatia to become Cyprus over a long period of 
time. We devoted special attention to this. I would even say 
that almost half of the negotiating time was devoted to this 
matter. 
  [Correspondent] A conviction prevails in Croatia that peace 
will be restored only when UNPROFOR is deployed along the 
borders of the sovereign and independent Republic of Croatia. 
How close is this agreement to that? 
  [Sarinic] Well, listen, these are two problems. Your second 
question is more in connection with the next UNPROFOR mandate. 
Of course, we have been insisting on it, the Croatian 
leadership has been insisting on it. The problem of controlling 
the borders is naturally the fundamental problem, however, 
because it creates conditions for the prevention of an influx of 
weapons and special units from the east. This further creates 
conditions for the resolution of difficult problems, very 
complex problems, in a normal way--problems of the type of 
autonomy. All these solutions will be based on our Constitution 
and the constitutional law. In this regard, however, Croatia 
will particularly insist that the next UNPROFOR mandate should 
create conditions for controlling borders. 
  I must say that UNPROFOR does not have the power to 
implement 
it today. But, you know, what before seemed to be science 
fiction-- that NATO could come and secure these borders--is 
becoming a very realistic possibility today that is being 
examined by all, including the top players in the international 
arena. 
  [Correspondent] At the end, these negotiations lasted quite 
long. What was the atmosphere like, and why was it shrouded in 
so much secrecy when it came to the flow of information, when it 
came to all those things in which our public was so much 
interested? 
  [Sarinic] This is almost a provocative question from you, 
because personally I am not much inclined to great media 
coverage. I believe that we must not interrupt business and come 
out with details from the course of negotiations when such 
serious business is being dealt with, because many different 
interpretations will be given that can have a negative effect on 
the results of the negotiations. 
  We were very disciplined. We had agreed with the mediators 
in these negotiations, and nobody, as you saw, made any 
statements. 
  [Correspondent] What are further steps to be taken now? 
  [Sarinic] Further steps are the following: We must not treat 
the signed agreement in a static way. It is only phase one, and 
it is to be implemented on the ground in seven to 10 days. We 
will have additional meetings immediately afterwards, which we 
have to prepare and at which we will examine economic issues. 
Talks on the specific political solution will be held after 
that. I think that talks on phase three will begin in three 
weeks or one month. They are not going to be concluded in one 
night. No matter how long they may be, we created conditions 
for them today. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Sarinic, thank you very much for the 
interview. 
  [Sarinic] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "We Are Going To Change the System of </F>
Defense"] 
  [Text] When the new Ustasha state threatened us with a 
repeat of genocide in the summer of 1990, we had to be the first 
to start an uprising against those to whom the Serbs themselves, 
through their superhuman struggle, and as if on a platter, 
presented a state that they had not managed to create for 1,000 
years. 
  The just struggle for the physical survival of the Serbian 
people of Krajina has put back on the world political scene the 
need for Serbian national unity, which was interrupted at the 
end of 19th century and the beginning of 20th century. In this 
I see the greatest contribution of the Krajina people to the 
universal struggle of the Serbian people for national unity. 
  This is what, among other things, Milan Martic, president of 
the republic of Serbian Krajina, said in an interview to VOJSKA 
KRAJINE. Martic pointed out the following: 
  "Being positioned at the far western outpost of the Serbian 
nation and surrounded by the hostile politics of Croatia, the 
Serbs in Krajina have managed, over three years and with many 
casualties, to withstand all the assaults of the Ustasha state 
and to preserve their freedom. We have managed to create a 
state with all the attributes of statehood except international 
recognition. The world's politicians are already getting used 
to this state as a reality, and I think that, regardless of 
their wishes, Croatia's politicians will also have to respect it 
because there will be no peace in these regions without that." 
<H5>  Not Only Defensive </H5>
  I expect, Martic says, that this year a solution will be 
found to the clashes on the territory of the former Yugoslavia 
and thereby to the question of the unification of Serbian 
states. This was my election program and, even more important, 
it was with such an orientation that we set off into this new 
pan-Serbian struggle in which we have suffered huge losses for 
the umpteenth time. 
  Nobody, including those of us who now lead the people, has 
the right to betray these ideals that have moved our people into 
new sufferings and self-denials. Pan-Serbian unification is our 
strategic aim and our program. How we will implement that 
strategy is another question. I think that the obstacles will 
be huge and that a lot of political wisdom and skill, and a lot 
of unity and patience will be needed to realize this great aim. 
  In reply to the question about the defense of the republic 
of 
Serbian Krajina, Martic said the following: 
  Our defense has so far been based on outdated and 
inefficient 
principles -- on the principle of armed people and defending of 
one's own home. We mobilized almost all the citizens who could 
fight but we nevertheless had poor results in some military 
operations. A large proportion of the armed men were 
disorganized and resorted to their own initiative, something 
that can be fatal in war. Therefore, changes that will 
fundamentally modify the defense system are needed. On the one 
hand, we will be working on creating a professional core of the 
army, which will consist of mobile and stable maneuver units, 
well equipped and paid. Such units would be able to perform all 
tasks, be it defending an section of our territory under attack 
or dealing a blow to the enemy where he is most sensitive. We 
must no longer exclusively base our defense on a defensive 
strategy, that is, on defending the regions under attack. 
  On the other hand, our global policy will be directed toward 
creating conditions for peace, above all through political 
negotiations with the side at war. We can enter these 
negotiations only if we have forces that the enemy respects. 
<H5>  The Return of Officers </H5>
  According to some people, professionalization in the army, 
in 
the way it should be, will weaken our defense force, which is 
completely wrong. As I have already said, now we only have 
armed people, but that cannot be considered a real army. The 
working population will still be military reservists who, if 
need be, can be mobilized at any moment. 
  It is important to distribute the load of war more equally 
among all republic of Serbian Krajina citizens. When I say 
this I mean that all those who have so far not felt the war 
should in a way in the future be included in what we call the 
united defense system. As regards deserters, there are measures 
to deal with them, and as regards private entrepreneurs, we have 
nothing against them doing their job, but they should also 
perform their duties in defense. 
  One component upon which we will build our defense system is 
good cooperation with the armed forces of the Srpska republic 
and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Now we can create a 
model of armed forces that may be a basis for a united army in 
the future joint state. For this, of course, we need the help 
and cooperation of military and civilian structures in other 
Serbian lands. As regards this help, it has never been lacking 
so far. However, we must insist on the return of all militarily 
fit citizens who are in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] 
at the moment. Officers are particularly valuable to us and, in 
this regard, we have received understanding among the FRY 
authorities in helping us have these people return to the 
Krajina.

  [Text] Belgrade, 30 Mar (TANJUG) -- The village of Islam 
Grcki and a part of the village of Kasic in the Zadar 
hinterland, which are still controlled by the Croatian forces 
and which should be returned to the republic of Serb Krajina 
according to the cease-fire agreement signed in Zagreb last 
night, were in flames at around 1900 this evening, ISKRA 
[Krajina Serb news agency] has reported. 
  This news caused anger among the Serb fighters in the area 
of 
Benkovac who wanted to retaliate by attacking Croatian troops 
because of this barbarism. As ISKRA has learned from the Serb 
Krajina army liaison officer, Mladen Kalapac, the Serb side 
immediately reacted by demanding an immediate halt to the 
torching of the Serb villages. 
  UN Protection Force representatives promised they would most 
urgently get involved in preventing the torching of the villages 
of Kasic and Islam Grcki.

  [Text] In the view of Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik, 
the number-one priority in Czech-Slovak relations is to preserve 
integration and cooperation at least at its current level. At a 
meeting with journalists today, he said that the preservation of 
the customs union was important, mainly in view of the expected 
integration into the European Union. The prime minister also 
called for a solution to yet-unresolved problems. At the same 
time, however, he expressed doubts as to whether this could be 
achieved during the six months of his government's term of 
office. 
  Moravcik said it would be a great success if the division of 
assets of the former Federation was finally resolved. He would 
also like to improve Slovak-Hungarian relations, which were 
considerably tense during Meciar's rule, before the Paris 
conference (?of the Pact) on stability in Europe.

<F P=106> [Article by "hop": "The Importance of the Czech Republic in </F>
Heroin Trade Is Growing"] 
  [Text] Prague--Czech policemen managed within a week to 
seize 25 kg of pure heroin, which is almost 8 kg more than over 
the entire past year. These figures, together with the 
statistics of drugs seized in Western Europe, which the 
smugglers evidently transported through the territory of the 
Czech Republic (less than 750 kg in 1992, 997 kg last year), 
testify to the steadily growing quantity of heroin in transit 
and to the important status of the Czech Republic on the 
so-called Balkan route. A total in excess of 8,000 kg of heroin 
was seized in all European states last year, which is one-half 
more than in 1988. 
  Two branches of this smuggling path go through the Czech 
Republic. One leads from Istanbul, Turkey, through Sofia, 
Belgrade, Budapest, and Prague to the Waldhaus border crossing. 
The other branch passing through the Czech-German border begins 
in Constanta, Romania. In both instances, the final destination 
for the narcotics is Scandinavia and West Europe. According to 
police sources, only a marginal part of the narcotics remains in 
the Czech Republic. Because of the high price of heroin, its 
users are recruited mostly from business circles. Jiri Richter, 
director of the National Drug and Information Service, comments 
on this: "Recently, the participation of the Czech citizens in 
various crime organizations involved in drug smuggling has 
grown. It is understandable: The Czech cleverness, longing for 
money, and skills are rather expedient features for narcotics 
trade." 
  One of the important sites for drug smuggling is the 
[Prague-] Ruzyne airport. Drug couriers from Asia, Africa, and 
South America come to Prague and then continue to Europe in cars 
or by train. Because of the limited technical possibilities and 
lack of legislation, the Prague airport is becoming a suitable 
transfer point for smugglers. 
  Drug-crime specialists point out that the interest in the 
Czech Republic on the part of dealers is not ceasing because 
dirty money can be laundered here without many problems. 
According to them, the individual gangs will attempt to 
penetrate the highest political and social strata.

<F P=106> [Article by K.Gr.: "Lech Walesa Suggests That He Will Run; I </F>
Will Do So Wearing Gloves"] 
  [Text] "If I were to make the decision today, I would not 
sign the Budget Law," Lech Walesa said on Wednesday [30 March] 
at a meeting with the journalists of SLOW0--DZIENNIK KATOLICKI. 
He has not made the decision yet. Walesa denies that a "quiet 
agreement" has been reached between him and Prime Minister 
Pawlak. "I am increasingly more convinced that I will have to 
fight for it once again," says Walesa, when asked whether he 
will run in the presidential elections. Who will win the next 
parliamentary elections? "Definitely not the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD]." 
  Walesa does not regret strengthening "the left pillar." He 
does not regret "any of the main points of his activities." "So 
it should not put out its left leg for the right pillar," he 
adds. He also specified that the "screwups" are those "who 
pretend to be the right wing but who actually are not." In this 
context, he listed Aleksander Hall. One could also call them a 
different name; "they are kind of Christian children brought up 
by the communists." 
  Walesa is waiting for "the right side" to present him with 
proposals on file-checking and decommunization that he will be 
able to recommend. "If I did this myself, it would be 
ill-received." 
  "We will see once again whether I can omit the Sejm. I am 
saying this seriously," he answered a question concerning the 
Concordat. 
  He is convinced that the Sejm will not try to limit the 
president's powers. "If it tries, there will be new elections. 
I am convinced that a different option will win, and I will 
contribute to that." 
  Asked whether this is an announcement of dissolving the 
parliament, he replies: "If a dissolution is necessary, there 
will be a dissolution." 
  Who will win the next elections? "Definitely not the SLD." 
"I will do everything wearing gloves, and when they realize the 
situation, it will be too late," he says. 
  At another moment he adds: "Once again the Politburo wants 
to 
have all the power. The Politburo forgets that, in the next 
term, it will not have all the power. Whatever it will take 
away from the president today, it will repay tomorrow." 
  If he were to make the decision today, he would not sign the 
Budget Law. "One cannot deceive the nation over and over. It 
was supposed to be different," he says. The coalition should 
tell the nation that "it will not deceive any longer." From 
"the economic point of view," the president is in despair 
because he understands that "it was not possible to make a 
greater move here." He has not made a decision yet. "It will 
be a well-considered decision. However, today I have great 
doubts," he stated. 
  He denied that he has a "quiet agreement" with Prime 
Minister 
Pawlak. "If such an agreement existed, I would say the 
situation is pretty bad because he is doing better and I am 
doing worse, and I do not like that." "Now, the president must 
know what the agreements are," he added. 
  At another moment, he added that he wishes Pawlak all the 
best, even though he fears that "the subjects are so difficult 
that one would need experience, which Pawlak does not have." 
  Asked whether he will run for the presidency a second time, 
he stated that "if I see sense in my work." "I have not made a 
final decision yet. I am increasingly more convinced that I 
will have to fight once more," he added. 
  Asked about PolSat, he said: "I only knew certain things 
that 
are coming to light now." He added that he believed that "one 
could find a cleaner case, more economic for everyone." 
  "This generation of ours is tired and destroyed and will not 
do much," he confessed. "Communist screwups..." --"that was 
about everyone, including me," he added.

<F P=106> [Article by E.K., E.Cz., and K.Gr.: "There Is Still Deadlock </F>
in Rosati Issue; There Were No Talks With President"] 
  [Text] "Meetings will be held, but the decision is final," 
said Lech Walesa on Wednesday [30 March], when asked whether he 
will hold more talks with the coalition on the nomination of 
Dariusz Rosati. "Certain things have already been said and 
written. You want to have a serious president, do you not?" he 
asked at a meeting with the journalists of SLOWO--DZIENNIK 
KATOLICKI. "Unless the coalition presents a new candidate, I 
will propose someone," said Walesa and laughed. 
  "Do the people of communism still think that this is a 
Politburo decision? Now, they are still behaving as if this 
were a decision by the Politburo. Nothing is going to scare or 
change me--only the elections," he said. 
  "Why, would they like me to chicken out?" he asked. He 
stated that the president cannot be "forced to sign any 
documents simply because the coalition has decided so." 
  Despite the coalition leaders' hopes to meet the president 
soon, such a meeting was not held on Wednesday. Zbigniew 
Siemiatkowski gave assurances, however, that the coalition will 
make efforts to hold such a meeting with the president, during 
which the leaders will try to win Lech Walesa over to the 
candidacy of Dariusz Rosati for deputy prime minister and 
finance minister. It is hardly possible for the meeting to be 
held before Easter because, on Wednesday afternoon, Aleksander 
Kwasniewski and Jozef Oleksy flew off to Moscow for an official 
parliamentary visit. The visit will last until Friday. 
  Before leaving for Moscow, Kwasniewski reiterated that 
Dariusz Rosati had not changed his mind. He is still the 
candidate of the coalition, and he will not withdraw until the 
coalition thinks it necessary. He added, however: "It is not 
known what will happen tomorrow." 
  "The main person to participate in these talks should be 
Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, who put forward this candidacy. 
However, I have also said I would like to take part in the 
talks," he said. 
  Jozef Oleksy said that the president's decision was legal 
and 
in conformity with his powers. Even though the Small 
Constitution only vaguely defines the procedure for forming the 
government by the president, similarly inexact provisions could 
be found in almost all democratic constitutions. However, 
"hardly any European president thinks of using such powers." 
  "I am trying to soothe the tempers of politicians. However, 
the situations that we are witnessing should not be occurring," 
said Oleksy.

  [Excerpts] President Lech Walesa has until midnight to sign 
the law on wages in enterprises, which replaces the so-called 
excess wage increase tax [popiwek] law that is in force until 
the end of March. According to information from the 
Presidential Chancellery, Walesa will make a decision on this 
matter this afternoon. 
  Asked about the situation if the president refuses to sign 
the law, director Zbigniew Boniuszko, of the Finance Ministry, 
said it would be more dangerous for the economy than not signing 
the budget law. [passage omitted] 
  In an interview for PAP granted this morning, President 
Walesa was asked if he would sign the budget. He answered: 
  [Begin Walesa recording] Apart from everything else, I 
regard 
myself as a responsible politician, and I do everything to make 
sure that the prosperity of the country is a priority. Assuming 
I do not sign the budget, I would not sign it knowing that the 
coalition would pull it through. Someone could say, you are 
irresponsible, what are all these games for, you are not serious 
enough for the president. 
  I want to draw attention and initiate a discussion. From now 
on, I want society to be taken seriously, to think differently, 
even about the budget. The budget is only for one year. To 
start with, it is clear it will be amended. There is no doubt 
about it; everyone is saying so. What is more important--this 
budget, the purpose of which is to start certain economic 
processes in Poland, or the nation? [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Malgorzata Subotic: "Veto's Small Chance; So </F>
Far, President Has Not Undertaken Any Measure Against Reforms"] 
  [Text] If the president decided to veto the budget 
law, it is very likely that the Sejm would overrule the 
presidential veto. Yesterday, Lech Walesa said that "for now" 
he will not sign the budget, while Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy 
recalled that the deadline for Walesa to veto the budget is 25 
April. "There is conflicting information emerging from the 
President's Office--sometimes it is that the president will sign 
the budget, and, at other times, that he will veto it." So say 
politicians with whom we talked, and they also add that similar 
news was coming out of the Belweder regarding Rosati's 
candidacy. 
<H5>  Why President Would Invoke a Veto </H5>
  "The nation has been cheated again; life was supposed to get 
better," Walesa said yesterday, while explaining why he would 
not sign the budget "for now." But he immediately made the 
stipulation that, "from an economic viewpoint," he is desperate 
because he knows that, apart from minor changes, the budget law 
cannot be amended a great deal. 
  Even Walesa's critics admit that, so far, he has not 
undertaken any specific measure that would be targeted against 
market transformations. He has signed all economy-related laws 
(with the exception of the one concerning retirement pensions 
for uniformed officials), even those that limited senior 
citizens' income levels. 
  Views on the budget adopted by the Sejm tend to be 
unanimous: 
Generally speaking, the budget maintains the direction of 
reforms implemented thus far. International financial 
institutions and our Western creditors express a similar view. 
It is obvious that lack of a budget law would get a bad 
perception in those circles. 
  So why is the president suggesting that he might not place 
his signature on the document? 
  "To clearly demonstrate that he is keeping a distance from 
the current governing coalition and to be favorably looked upon 
by future voters whose views are populist and geared toward 
making claims"--this is what some say. "He is hoping that he 
will manage to dissolve the parliament at the same time"--this 
is what other people assume. 
  The first hypothesis could be confirmed by friendly gestures 
vis-a-vis Solidarity, which is demanding that the budget be 
changed or else the trade union will wage a general strike. 
"Except that, this way, Walesa would alienate those whom he 
once addressed by saying: `Take things into your own hands.'" 
This is what Wieslawa Ziolkowska, of the Union of Labor [UP], 
thinks. 
  Would the president be empowered to dissolve the parliament 
if the Sejm failed to overrule his veto on the budget? 
Provisions of the Small Constitution confirm yet again that the 
document is not specific enough. Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, of the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], fears that one could make the 
interpretation that the president could indeed dissolve the 
parliament. But the view prevails that the parliament enacted 
the budget, and it did so within the three-month period required 
by the Constitution. Andrzej Potocki, of the Democratic Union 
[UD], even says that the Sejm could readopt the same version of 
the budget within about a dozen days. 
<H5>  Dangers It Can Cause </H5>
  "The president will not accomplish anything by vetoing the 
budget. It will practically have zero impact on the domestic 
situation because the Constitution provides that, if there is no 
adopted budget law, the government acts on the basis of what it 
had itself submitted before, which in this case means the budget 
that was adopted and later vetoed," Sejm Deputy Ziolkowska says. 
But she also adds that lack of a budget law "will cause external 
destabilization. Our foreign creditors have agreed to reduce 
our debts mainly because of the solutions contained in the 
budget." 
  Sejm Speaker Oleksy, among others, has a different view: "A 
delay in the signing of the budget law prevents financial means 
from flowing down from the central budget to those institutions 
that are financed by that budget. If the president does not 
sign the budget law, an unstable situation will be created 
`completely unnecessarily.'" 
  We asked Elzbieta Suchocka, a director at the Finance 
Ministry, to explain the issue. In her view, in a situation 
where the law was adopted by the Sejm but was not published in 
DZIENNIK USTAW [official publication with final versions of laws 
adopted by parliament and signed by the president] (due to a 
delay in the president's signing or lack of a signature), the 
law's status is the same as that of a draft law, which means it 
exists in effect but with one important proviso: There are 
authorizations contained in the budget law for the Council of 
Ministers to issue executory legal acts. The government is not 
authorized to issue such acts without a law. So it would not be 
possible, for instance, to issue bonds (which are one of the 
sources of financing the budget deficit) or to devote reserves 
from centrally financed projects to gminas [small administrative 
units] endangered by unemployment. There would also be problems 
with agricultural credits. 
<H5>  What Will Happen </H5>
  According to our estimates, it is almost certain that a 
presidential veto, if it did occur, would be overruled. A 
two-thirds majority vote is required for that. The SLD 
coalition does not have such a majority; it is nine votes short 
of the 307 required. As UP's Wieslawa Ziolkowska told us, she 
will make efforts to have the UP Sejm Deputies Club vote in 
favor of overruling the veto. Even though UP voted against the 
budget during the Sejm vote, "these are two separate votings." 
The government would operate under the "old budget" anyway, but 
it would cause effects outside of Poland. UD still does not 
know how it will vote, and its Sejm deputies "would have to 
consider the issue."

  [Text] The relationship between the government and the 
president has a multifaceted character, Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak told the "Panorama" program, adding that the coalition 
maintains the proposed candidacy of Dariusz Rosati. Until such 
time as the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] or the candidate 
himself makes a decision on this matter, the candidacy remains 
in force. 
  [Begin recording] [Pawlak] Apart from this matter, there is 
an entire series of other problems that must be taken into 
account. A decision was made by the Council of Ministers 
yesterday, in the presence of the president, on the presentation 
of an application for membership in the EU. The decisions of 
the president on the matter of the budget law await us, and this 
decision has a very significant and important meaning from both 
an internal and an external point of view. Even if this budget 
does not fully fulfill all expectations, it is still an 
exceptionally important matter--that the decision on this matter 
be a very serious one, taking into account the needs of the 
economy and of society because, after all, this budget also 
contains amendments and modifications decided in parliament. 
  An important matter is the decision on the electoral law to 
parish councils. Here, we will shortly have elections to parish 
self-governments and the Senate by-elections. This shows that 
the relationship between the government and the president ought 
to have a substantive and concrete character. That is how it 
ought to be seen. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Discussions are in progress 
among politicians on the subject of a possible coming together, 
as between the Polish Peasant Party and the Belweder camp, at 
the cost of the SLD. How do you judge the permanency of the 
current coalition? 
  [Pawlak] I think that the facts show the reality at the 
moment. The coalition is behaving in a manner that is in accord, 
and these relationships of which I spoke earlier ought to be 
seen in their entirety. Then they take into account all the 
circumstances, both those associated with the functioning of the 
coalition, with the functioning of the government, and those of 
the office of the president. All of these activities ought to 
take into account the expectations and needs of society and the 
interests of the state, the interests of Poland. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy, by Aleksander </F>
Geryn, identified via screen caption, in Warsaw, from the 
"Sejmograph" program; date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Geryn] Mr. Speaker, almost six months have 
passed since the second-term Sejm started work. Many people 
have begun to refer to this Sejm as a kind of a legislative 
voting machine--there are not enough fireworks, there is not 
enough friction. To cut a long story short, they say that this 
is a boring Sejm. Do you agree with that opinion? 
  [Oleksy] I certainly do not agree with it. It depends on 
the particular idea of the Sejm that each of us has. One can 
say that the previous Sejms were a greater source of joy to the 
viewers and various observers because there really were many 
clashes. Even when they were about insignificant issues or 
so-called substitute subjects, they provided certain dynamics, 
the dynamics of disputes, quarrels, arguments. Well, this is 
definitely much more pleasurable to watch than the monotony of 
solid legislative work. [passage omitted] 
  The Sejm is always some kind of theater; however, what 
should 
be taken care of is that this role of the Sejm is not its 
leading role, just as it used to be in the past. It so happens 
that the Sejm primarily works as the supreme organ of the 
legislative authorities; it defines the law, fulfills the 
controlling function; it watches the government, discusses 
reports prepared by the Supreme Chamber of Control, statements 
by the Constitutional Tribunal, and, finally, it passes laws in 
the complex legislative procedure. I believe that people who 
observe the work of this Sejm for a longer period will admit 
that there is less theatrical behavior, so it is perhaps not so 
interesting.... [Oleksy pauses] Well, but I must say that, 
actually, as far as some issues are concerned, this Sejm has 
already witnessed several heated discussions. [passage omitted] 
  [Geryn] Let me now return to the issue of theatrical 
behavior. Indeed, the deputies themselves are more quiet, as it 
were, and the debates are held relatively quietly as well. 
However, there is some friction, which seems quite 
considerable, between the Belweder and the parliament. Right 
now this conflict seems to be dying down a bit. However, this 
is characterized by some fluctuation: At one point there is a 
conflict, then it dies down. Nonetheless, people who observe 
the political scene in Poland believe that a conflict does exist 
there. Can you confirm this? 
  [Oleksy] No, I cannot. I think that this opinion is based 
on one or two incidents. There is no antipresidential or 
anti-Walesa atmosphere. Because this is true, which I know for 
sure, there is no reason for great friction. However, it 
sometimes happens that the president in enthusiasm uses phrases 
that concern the entire Sejm and are not really complimentary to 
it; of course, I do not want praise from the president. What I 
mean is a certain extremity in the president's interpretations 
of situations that are usual in the Sejm. Let us take the 
example of rejecting the presidential bills; this may happen 
more than once, and it happens not only to presidential bills. 
The parliament's task is to evaluate and discuss a bill and 
then make a decision in a ballot. Now, if the president makes a 
rapid, public evaluation and generalizes a given issue and thus 
issues an overall evaluation of the Sejm, it certainly may 
resemble a conflict, but there is no such conflict. I only fear 
that, as we draw closer to the presidential campaign, we may 
more and more often hear such sharp, firm, tactical statements; 
however, I would not like to see this occur. 
  [Geryn] Immediately after being elected speaker of the Sejm, 
you said: I am open to contacts with the extraparliamentary 
opposition, with the parties that lost in the elections last 
September. What does this look like in practice? 
  [Oleksy] In practice it looks quite miserable because my 
genuine political offer was treated by most extraparliamentary 
groupings as some kind of a game, tactics, as the parliament's 
attempt to legitimize itself, which, really, the parliament does 
not need. I would like to say that this is a bad approach. I 
think that this is detrimental to a dialogue in the state--a 
dialogue about essential issues, which is really needed. I 
think that the ideas that came up as a result of a lack of 
readiness to cooperate in the creation of the Constitution... 
[Oleksy pauses] I think they are not likely to be successful. 
They will only obscure the picture of some kind of joint 
thinking about the Constitution. I will say once again that the 
political offer of opening the Sejm to cooperation with 
extraparliamentary groupings is still a valid offer; however, 
the response to it is next to none.

<F P=106> [Statements by Polish Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk </F>
and General Tadeusz Wilecki, chief of the Polish Army's General 
Staff, during a news conference with unidentified reporters; 
place and date not given--live or recorded; from the "Caliber" 
military program] 
  [Excerpts] [Kolodziejczyk] What happened to the Armed 
Forces' budget this year smacks of a scandal. There occurred 
far-reaching interference by the legislative branch with the 
powers of the executive branch. That is unacceptable. If the 
[defense] ministry's chief is supposed to bear constitutional 
responsibility for the Armed Forces' readiness and the readiness 
of the country's defense system, one must not tie his hands with 
decisions on where and how money should be spent because this 
way one will not succeed in creating anything that would make 
sense or be a logical whole. Under the situation that has 
emerged, I will submit a complaint before the Constitutional 
Tribunal. [passage omitted] 
  We are not so conservative as to refuse to give up 
anything--we can see the need ourselves. The Army is smaller; 
personnel policies have changed; there is a different concept, 
generally speaking; there are fewer officers who are better 
educated; there are more ensigns and noncommissioned officers; 
the size of forces on contract and over-the-time service has 
increased, following the example of other armies; and there is 
also an increased level of professionalism, but not necessarily 
through increases in the size of the officer corps. As a result 
of the last, we also have a process of integration with regard 
to military education, but that is a process the rate of which, 
unfortunately, is also dependent on the budget. 
  [Wilecki] I think that in 1995--and I am saying this 
officially--we are making efforts to make it possible to 
introduce a 12-month service term. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] If I may, I would like to elaborate on that 
issue in a couple or more sentences. It used to be that one had 
to serve three years in the Navy, and training of a naval expert 
using equipment that was not that complicated lasted six months. 
So that meant six months of training and two and a half years 
of service itself. Right now, training a radio-telegraphic 
operator to a decent level by using the equipment the regiment 
has at its disposal, takes seven to eight months. Now, if 
service takes 12 months, its real, actual length will be only 
four months. So the question is: What kind of implementation 
has to take place to secure the servicing of equipment at a 
decent level? That is the main problem here. And there is no 
other way to cut short the length of military service except to 
professionalize the service, which means over-the-time and 
contract service when, after a cycle of training, there follows 
a four-year period of service--that is to say, four years at the 
minimum. Except that, in order to introduce that kind of 
service, just as General Wilecki said, there must be legislative 
regulations that would eliminate all waivers of military service 
due to cultivating a hectare of land, having this or that number 
of children, and so forth. This is a citizen's duty, and we are 
all equal in the eyes of the law and the Constitution. That is 
the first thing. As a second issue, we come back to the issue 
because one must invest resources in the establishment of a 
corps of cadre of the over-the-time service and contract 
service, as I mentioned. [passage omitted] 
  [Wilecki] Generally speaking, the Armed Forces are in bad 
shape. It is my moral duty--and I have been fulfilling this for 
two years now--to make the supreme authorities in the state 
aware of things because it is those authorities who bear 
responsibility for the country's security. As chief of the 
Polish Army's General Staff, I am responsible for certain 
things, I feel it is my duty to bring them to light, and I think 
the country's supreme authorities are being made aware of these 
issues. The fact that you [addressing the journalists] do not 
know all of the details--forgive me, but the special services of 
our various potential friends and enemies are working around the 
clock and are following various events. So it would be hard to 
expect the mass media to publish details on the Armed Forces' 
protection systems and functioning. One must realize that some 
things are discussed behind closed doors. I am hoping that the 
parliamentary debate, which Sejm Speaker Oleksy announced during 
his meeting with the General Staff's leadership a few weeks 
back, will be a closed-door debate and that it will lead to some 
details being cleared up. It is true that not all members of 
parliament feel comfortable with defense matters. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Sejm Speaker Mr. Jozef Oleksy has said 
publicly that the debate will indeed take place in the month of 
April. Practically speaking, the Army and the Defense Ministry 
have been ready for it for a long time now. What do we expect 
from the debate? We expect no miracles because tea does not get 
sweet simply by stirring it. But there is a very significant 
issue: putting in order the legal framework for the Defense 
Ministry's functioning, and also of the General Staff and all 
structures of the Army. This requires great effort and is a 
very urgent issue. In fact, in the eyes of the West, we may 
well be perceived as an Army that failed to accomplish anything 
in terms of reform because it continues to be headed by a 
minister with powers provided for by a 1967 law, so, despite the 
fact that the minister wears civilian clothes, he has a right to 
command the forces, in accordance with the law I mentioned and 
that is in force. 
  Incidentally, I want to explain something with regard to the 
West's perception of these issues. As far as I can figure out, 
it is of no interest to them who is in charge of the ministry 
and what kind of uniform he used to wear, be it a railway 
uniform, a military one, or some other type. What is important 
to them is precisely what we are talking about--that is to say, 
power. So the minister can be a civilian if he has the power to 
exert administrative and political supervision over the Army. 
And there is the Armed Forces' commander, who, in our case, is 
known as chief of the General Staff and who is charged with 
statutory responsibility for the defense readiness of military 
units--that is, of the Armed Forces. That is the first 
necessary step and there are very many others to follow. That 
is the first thing we expect from the Sejm debate. We expect it 
will be a new incentive for putting these things in order, 
including the Small Constitution, the powers of the Security 
Council, SORM [expansion unknown], and so forth. Another thing 
we expect is that the Sejm will make a decision on reaching a 
certain fixed level of GDP within a set time limit, to be spent 
on the defense budget, and that, thanks to that, we will be able 
to arrange our implementation potential in a way that would make 
sense, taking into account our financial capabilities. These 
are the two issues that can bring a vast improvement to the 
entire ministry, particularly the Armed Forces, without 
additional resources. [passage omitted] The optimism I sense 
is over the fact that West Europe's two largest countries--with 
the greatest economic and military potential--made a decision to 
recommend us for associate membership in the Western European 
Union [WEU]. That means introductory integration into European 
security structures. It also brings results in the form of a 
promise of openness to technological and technical cooperation. 
We have been fighting for that kind of openness for several 
years now, with a complete lack of success, I might add. The 
intention of implementing both the Partnership for Peace 
initiative and the most recent initiative regarding cooperation 
with the WEU countries is to collect experiences precisely at 
the level of basic units, which means platoons and companies. 
Then we will find out what is the relationship between our 
communications and command systems, training techniques, signal 
methods, and so forth, and then, on the basis of these 
conclusions, we will have an opportunity to correct our own 
programs and move to a higher level of cooperation or joint 
exercises in the following year. 
  To have the best possible relations with our neighbors is 
the 
primary principle of our security policy. Second, it is 
regional cooperation; third, European structures; and, finally, 
arms reduction. So the first item requires two parties to 
participate. My sense is that Western countries have matured 
enough so as not to be alarmed by every move of President 
Yeltsin's or Minister Kozyrev's eyelids, and to instead 
implement what is rational at a given point. Integrating Poland 
and other countries into European security structures, which 
means eliminating the gray area--that is rational. Gray areas 
always bring to mind potential possibilities of destabilization. 
I think the trend should be spread over and cover the remaining 
countries. It is a process, but, for the moment, let us focus on 
what pertains to Poland. So there is a chance for Poland, and 
we shall see what will happen in May. I am optimistic, and I 
have faith that Poland will be an associate member of the WEU.

  [Excerpts] Warsaw, 29 Mar--Poland and Belarus want to 
cooperate in preventing and combating particularly dangerous 
contagious diseases, including the HIV-AIDS epidemic, 
journalists were told today at the outset of a four-day 
Polish-Belarus working conference in Warsaw. 
  The conference is attended by representatives of the Belarus 
Ministry of Health and the five largest cities of this state in 
charge of health-care organizations, blood donation, and 
epidemiology. [passage omitted] 
  In Belarus there have been 102 recorded cases of 
HIV-positive 
people, including seven children. Of those 102, 10 are already 
suffering from AIDS. Seventy percent of all cases are located 
in Minsk. According to Polish doctors, Belarus is at the stage 
of the AIDS epidemic where Poland was six to seven years ago. 
  According to the State Institute of Hygiene, there were 
2,935 
recorded cases of HIV-positive people by the end of February 
[1994]. Of those, 175 persons contracted AIDS, and 98 have 
already died. These are only estimates. Dr. Krzysztof 
Dziubinski, adviser to the minister of health, maintains that a 
growing trend can be observed. 
  As far as diphtheria is concerned, there were 120 cases 
recorded in Belarus last year, while there were only 10 in 
Poland. Last year, Belarus purchased Polish antidiphtheria 
vaccine. It is going to test it and use it in preventive 
treatment.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 25 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The Central 
American Parliament (Parlacen) today denounced the charging of a 
$130 fee to people who request political asylum in the United 
States -- an action the U.S. Government plans to put into 
practice in the near future. Parlacen President Jose Guerrero, 
who is a Salvadoran citizen, responded bitterly to the U.S. 
initiative, arguing that it goes against international 
agreements on the right to political asylum. 
  Last week, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service 
[INS] announced the U.S. Government's intention to charge a fee 
to people who request political asylum to reduce INS expenses. 
The INS currently has more than 360,000 pending asylum 
requests. U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno explained a few days 
ago that the fee will only be charged to those people who can 
afford to pay it and that it will not be mandatory. 
  Nevertheless, the Parlacen president asserted, "To charge 
for 
political asylum is to exploit and profit from a human right we 
all have." Guerrero called the U.S. Government initiative 
"illogical," noting that it is being implemented "now in the 
1990's, when there is a worldwide effort to strengthen human 
rights." Guerrero stressed that the United States will be the 
only country in the world charging for political asylum if the 
measure goes into effect. 
  Gregg Breyer, the national director of the INS Asylum 
Office, 
has reported that his office is "flooded" with false petitions 
for political asylum and that petitioners know the chances are 
slim they will be deported.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 23 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Central 
American economy and commerce ministers today analyzed the 
impact that the North American Free Trade Agreement will have on 
the region, it was reported in this capital. 
  Having established a Tariff and Customs Council, on 
Wednesday 
the ministers will approve the proposed tariff rates for some 
products and on Thursday, as members of the Economic Council, 
they will discuss the mechanism for joining the trade agreement. 
  A source close to the meeting said that "the region paid 
$1.6 
billion in tariffs in recent months." 
  Economy Ministers Delmer Urbizo of Honduras, Enrique Cordova 
of El Salvador, and Pablo Pereira of Nicaragua participated in 
the discussions. Costa Rican Economy Minister Roberto Rojas and 
Guatemalan Economy Minister Eduardo Gonzalez also participated, 
and they will discuss options to negotiate a trade agreement 
with the United States, which could begin with parity for some 
benefits of the North American treaty. 
  The ministers will analyze the report titled "Commercial 
Relations Between Central America and the United States," to 
which NOTIMEX had access. The report establishes the 
negotiation of "parity" for some benefits or "full-rights" 
participation in the trilateral treaty. According to the report 
prepared by consultant Harold Rodas upon request from the UN 
Development Program (UNDP) and the Secretariat of Central 
American Economic Integration (SIECA), "the United States' 
commercial policy towards the region is not clearly defined." 
  The area's concern is apparent, and that is why efforts are 
being made to maintain the tariff benefits received from the 
United States and even to expand them in view of the benefits 
Mexico obtains by commercial agreements since NAFTA became 
effective in January. 
  The report asks: "When will Central America break the chains 
of dependency on a preferential system? Is the region prepared 
for the challenges of reciprocity?" According to Rodas, these 
questions arise because there "is an abyss between the political 
will and factual reality." 
  Regarding the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), 
through which the United States imports 4,300 duty free products 
from 139 countries and territories, the officials will review 
the 15-month extension approved by the United States which ends 
on 30 September. This preferential scheme seeks to sponsor 
beneficiary countries' economic and industrial development, and 
its legal base on a worldwide level is derived from Article IV 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The 
beneficiaries can export eligible products duty free to the 
United States, as long as they comply with norms of origin 
requirements -- above all having a national value-added rate of 
35 percent and a certificate of origin. 
  The UNDP-SIECA report, presented to the ministers on 
Wednesday, also examines the so-called Caribbean Basin 
Initiative sponsored by the United States. The initiative's goal 
is to increase local and foreign investments in non-traditional 
sectors, support economic diversification, and expand exports. 
The preferential system is more extensive than the GSP because 
no conditions are set on competition or graduality. However, the 
initiative excludes certain important categories, such as 
textiles, oil and oil derivatives, canned tuna, shoes, and 
leather articles. A country can lose its Caribbean Basin 
Initiative benefits by not cooperating in the struggle against 
drug trafficking, being communist, or expropriating U.S. 
citizens' assets, businesses, societies, or associations. The 
benefits may also be lost if a country does not maintain an 
extradition treaty with the United States. 
  The Central American economy ministers will analyze measures 
against disloyal competition implemented by different countries. 
  The officials began talks on Wednesday following a detailed 
report by SIECA Secretary Rafael Rodriguez Loucel on the 31st 
SIECA Directors Meeting, which ended yesterday.

  [Text] Panamanian Foreign Minister Raul Mulino said 
yesterday that Panama continues to support Costa Rican Foreign 
Minister Bernd Niehaus unconditionally in his aspiration for the 
position of OAS Secretary General. Mulino added that a pledged 
word "is written in stone," even if it is misinterpreted later. 
  Mulino said that groundless reports on this subject have 
been 
spread because, when Panama offered to support the Costa Rican 
Government, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's candidacy was 
anything but decided. 
  Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio visited 
Panama for a few hours to promote Gaviria's candidacy to this 
position, but Panama had already pledged its word for Costa Rica. 
  According to Mulino, the U.S. position in promoting 
Gaviria's 
candidacy cannot be interpreted as "blackmail. Whether we like 
it or not, the United States is a country on our continent with 
the full right to vote for whichever candidate it chooses," 
Mulino said finally.

  [Text] President Guillermo Endara of Panama and President 
Cesar Gaviria of Colombia have signed a joint declaration at the 
fourth meeting of the Colombian-Panamanian neighbors' 
commission. The two presidents signed the Transfer of Convicted 
Individuals Treaty, the Illegal Immigrants Agreement, and the 
Complementary Protocol on the Legal Assistant and Mutual 
Cooperation Agreement in Medellin. They also created the 
Permanent Commission for the Demarcation of the 
Colombian-Panamanian Border at the meeting. This commission will 
hold its first technical meeting in Santa Fe de Bogota on 17 and 
18 March. 
  In one of the paragraphs of the joint declaration, President 
Gaviria reiterated his satisfaction with Panama's efforts for 
the orderly transfer of the Panama Canal, which will occur on 31 
December 1999, and the canal's administration. According to a 
press note released by the Panamanian Presidency, the two 
presidents expressed their firm conviction that a full and 
participative democracy is the appropriate framework to meet the 
people's needs. They also agreed that social development 
programs strengthen democracy and that fighting poverty is a 
priority. 
  An ANSA dispatch, datelined Medellin, reports that yesterday 
Gaviria stressed the need for Colombia and Panama to consolidate 
their integration and cooperation to fight drug trafficking 
jointly. He maintained that "the big effort" the two countries 
are making to confront drug trafficking would be greatly 
rewarded "if we were able to strengthen coordination and 
cooperation between our nations' authorities on a permanent 
basis. Colombia and Panama have a great opportunity to fight 
this scourge; we can do more to make this threat disappear 
forever," Gaviria said at the opening of the fourth meeting of 
the Colombian-Panamanian neighbors' commission.

  [Editorial Report] Panama City Circuito RPC Television in 
Spanish at 0200 GMT on 23 February broadcasts during its 
regularly scheduled "Democracy 94" program a 60-minute live or 
recorded interview with Samuel Lewis Galindo, presidential 
candidate of the National Consensus Alliance, by "Democracy 94" 
host Hugo Famania. 
  Famania opens the program by asking Lewis Galindo why he 
decided to run for office since he is a very successful 
entrepreneur. He replies: "I have devoted 45 years of my life 
to private enterprise and I have developed it. I have created 
many job opportunities and given employment to many. I have 
seen many enterprises grow, and I have reached a stage in my 
life where I think I must devote my efforts to serving the 
fatherland." Lewis Galindo goes on to speak about the economic 
plan he would launch and explains that "we must try to keep a 
5-percent annual growth rate," and attain a national consensus 
that will keep the country calm so that foreign investments are 
made. This can only be done "if we modernize the government 
structures by improving administrative functions," he adds. 
  When Famania asks him if this modernization entails 
"reducing 
bureaucracy," Lewis Galindo answers that a modern and efficient 
state requires fewer personnel, but we must watch out for the 
high unemployment rate; therefore, private enterprise must grow. 
The presidential candidate goes on to speak about ways to 
reduce poverty and pay the "social debt" rather than pay the 
foreign debt. After pointing out the foreign debt is higher 
today that in 1989, Lewis Galindo says that, should he be 
elected, he will seek an agreement with the people to see how 
the country can cope with "these inherited responsibilities." 
  At 0230 GMT, Famania explains that Samuel Lewis Galindo is 
the presidential candidate of the National Consensus Alliance 
that is made up of Solidarity Party and the National Unity 
Mission. Expanding on the foreign debt issue, Lewis Galindo 
points out that another presidential candidate, Ruben Dario 
Carles, "is also responsible for the increase in the foreign 
debt" as Carles was the comptroller general for the current 
administration. To cope with this problem, Lewis Galindo says 
that the next government will have to do what Costa Rica did. 
For example, he adds, it must first seek Panamanian economists 
who will draft a national plan and not act according to "plans 
imposed by the international financing institutions, which is 
what has happened in Panama." 
  Lewis Galindo says that the only way Panama can obtain 
"adequate growth" is through exports, but the problem is that 
while private enterprise has modernized, the government has not. 
Panama must reduce tariffs, and the state must become more 
efficient, he points out. To sum it up, Famania emphasizes that 
Lewis Galindo proposes "modernization of the economy." 
  Turning to the subject of public security, Lewis Galindo 
says 
the National Police must become more professional, and the 
organization must be reorganized thoroughly, with a civilian 
hierarchy, without including the former officers of the defunct 
Panama Defense Forces and National Guard. 
  Referring to the Panama Canal, Famania mentions that "about 
one week ago, the new chief of the Southern Command said that 
the United States was willing to change the timetable for 
returning the military bases at the request of Panama." He then 
asks the presidential candidate: "Do you think it would be 
advisable for Panama to change this timetable?" Samuel Lewis 
Galindo answers: "I think we Panamanians must conduct ourselves 
with a certain amount of dignity. If the United States gives 
clear signals that it needs certain areas for some bases that 
will benefit Latin America and Panama, I -- as head of the 
government -- would be willing to negotiate. However, first of 
all, certain things would have to take place. First, we must 
determine what is the value, what is the economic potential of 
those bases? What are the economic benefits those bases have 
for the country versus the exploitation of those areas? It will 
probably be more advantageous for Panama -- should there be 
mutual interest by the two nations -- that these bases be moved 
to other areas where they will promote the development of those 
areas, for example Darien, should that be the case. Nonetheless, 
we must first consult the sovereign power, that is, the people." 
  As for the reverted areas, Lewis Galindo says he proposes 
conducting studies "to obtain the maximum benefit of the entire 
canal bank area, so that these resources will attract 
investors," but this must all be part of an overall program as 
"the former Canal Zone cannot become a privileged island while 
Panama remains poor." He adds that "the wealth generated from 
these areas must help solve the unemployment, health, and -- 
particularly -- the education problems." 
  The presidential candidate then answers listeners' questions 
that cover subjects such as denying there is any political 
agreement with the Democratic Revolutionary Party, 
privatization, and the Social Security system.

  [Text] Presidential Candidate Ruben Dario Carles has 
presented his government plan, which is entitled "Carles' Plan: 
New Jobs for All," to the nation for consideration. The plan 
lists a series of immediate measures his government will take to 
do away with unemployment in Panama and to develop several areas 
of the nation's economy. 
  Carles was nominated by the Nationalist Liberal Republican 
Movement (Molirena), the National Renewal Movement (Morena), and 
the Civilist Renewal parties. Some of the plan's immediate 
objectives are the construction of 115,000 "dignified homes" at 
a cost of $250 million, which will also create some 35,000 
direct and indirect jobs. The text of the plan follows: 
<H5>  Carles' Plan: New Jobs for All </H5>
  1. Promotion of microbusinesses and small enterprises 
  -- Technical support to improve productivity 
  -- Financial support for growth 
  -- Improved training and skill-enhancement 
  -- Information, counseling, and marketing center 
  -- Simple permit process to begin new operations 
  2. A. Creation and promotion of Export Production Zones 
nationwide 
  -- Streamline bureaucratic procedures and regulations that 
hamper and affect our relative advantages 
  -- Bilateral negotiation for better terms for exportable 
Panamanian products in U.S. markets 
  -- Agreement between workers and management to improve the 
Labor Code. Elimination of political influence in labor 
relations by reducing the government's participation in the 
regulating body. Training and skill-enhancement for personnel 
  -- Special utility and port tariffs for export corporations 
  B. Support for the Colon Free Zone and international trade 
activity 
  -- Expansion of available areas for growth and construction 
of new warehouses and holding and shipping facilities 
  -- More efficient and competitive port services, which are 
essential for servicing international trade 
  -- Improvement and expansion of communications and 
transportation services 
  -- Private operation of the national Railroad Company 
  -- International passenger and cargo services from the 
Enrique Jimenez Airport (formerly France Field) 
  -- Maintenance and widening of the Panama-Colon Highway 
  -- Protection, safety, and control for passengers and cargo 
between Panama City and Colon 
  -- Fight against drug trafficking 
  3. Immediately begin construction of 115,000 dignified homes 
at a cost of $250 million, which will generate 35,000 direct and 
indirect jobs during my administration 
  -- Development of Tocumen as an international air traffic 
hub 
  -- Promotion of the free zone for distributing fuel and oil 
byproducts 
  4. New investments and improvements in public works and 
services 
  -- Heightened quality and efficiency in public services 
(health, education, security, transportation, power, water, 
telephones, ports, and waste management) will begin during the 
first 100 days of this administration 
  -- Awareness of public employees' responsibility and the 
taxpayers' right to receive better public services at all 
government agencies 
  -- Institutional development requires public administration 
reforms, and such reforms will be implemented 
  -- National reforestation plan 
  -- Reforestation, forest production, and export programs 
  -- Development of 50,000 hectares of lumber forests across 
the country 
  -- The creation of 20,000 temporary and permanent jobs in 
rural areas 
  -- Streamlining and strengthening of tax breaks for 
reforestation projects 
  -- Environmental and ecological conservation 
  5. Investment promotion 
  A. Support for the promotion and development of the tourist 
sector, highlighting ecotourism 
  -- Creating a single office to resolve excessive government 
bureaucracy and simplify procedures 
  -- We will improve coordination between the public and the 
private sectors to allow coherent planning that will promote 
growth. We will also implement an evaluation system to allow 
rapid decisionmaking and expeditious actions to encourage 
investment in the tourist sector 
  -- Establishment of installations and facilities for cruise 
lines 
  B. Promotion of a maritime business and international 
cargo transshipment center with cargo container operations in 
Manzanillo, Telfers, Cristobal, and the port of Chiriqui Grande. 
  -- Legal and administrative structures will be improved to 
allow the integration of maritime activities under an entity 
that promotes Panama as a maritime business center. 
  C. Bolster the mining industry. 
  -- Incentives will be created for the commercial 
exploitation and development of our mining resources. 
  -- Exports will be promoted to reach a projected $500 
million annually by the year 2000. 
  -- Mining activity will generate 4,000 direct jobs and 
24,000 indirect jobs. 
  D. Develop the export availability of agriculture and cattle 
products. 
  -- Preferential conditions will be negotiated for 
Panamanian agricultural products in the United States. 
  -- Agriculture and cattle export production areas will be 
outfitted with the proper infrastructure. 
  -- The concerted agreement of labor conditions, which are 
better than what competing countries offer, will be promoted. 
  -- Financing will be sought for the production of 
agricultural products that have export possibilities. 
  -- Reasonable protection for certain basic agricultural 
food products for domestic consumption (meat, milk, rice, corn, 
sorghum, beans, potatoes, onions, and tomatoes) will be 
maintained. 
  -- A properly operating toxicology laboratory for meat 
exports. 
  -- A sterile fly production program to wipe-out the 
burrowing worm. This will generate 500 jobs. 
  -- The creation of facilities to convert Tocumen 
International Airport into a international air traffic center. 
  These policies will allow the Panamanian farmer to begin 
producing nontraditional products, thereby creating new jobs. 
Protectionism will enable farmers to ensure a market for their 
production and maintain jobs, and in certain cases, increase 
production to cover the domestic deficit of protected products. 
  Note: To the previously mentioned activities, we must add 
the 
activities that will emerge as a result of the negotiations on 
the use of existing facilities in Panama for U.S. Government 
defense use, which we are proposing.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Pritsiolas] </F>
  [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares [Democratic Revolutionary 
Party candidate -- PRD], Ruben Dario Carles [Nationalist Liberal 
Republican Movement candidate], and Ruben Blades [Papa Egoro 
Movement candidate] registered the highest citizen preference 
ratings for the presidency of the Republic. Those results stem 
from a poll requested by Telemetro Television Network which 
included interviews conducted in 1,260 houses in Panama, Cocle, 
Chiriqui, Herrera, Los Santos, and Veraguas Provinces from 9 to 
11 February. The Federico Guerra consulting firm carried out the 
poll. 
  The results of the poll show that Perez Balladares obtained 
a 
32.8 percent preference rating; Carles a 16.3 percent; and 
Blades 14.8 percent. Arnulfist Party candidate Mireya Moscoso 
de Gruber is in fourth place with 9.9 percent; industrialist 
Samuel Lewis Galindo [Solidarity Party candidate] came in fifth 
with 2.9 percent; Christian Democratic Party candidate Eduardo 
Vallarino, the sixth position with 2 percent; and last place is 
held by Jose Salvador Munoz [Doctrinaire Panamenist Party 
candidate] who obtained 0.2 percent. The poll results also 
indicate that 21.1 percent of the people interviewed remain 
undecided on who they will vote for in the 8 May presidential 
elections. 
  Comparing this poll with others carried out at the end of 
1993, it can be noted that Carles, who did not appear in the 
latter, has managed to overtake other candidates, including 
Ruben Blades, in this one. Blades, however, has suffered a 
decline in his popularity rating. 
  Furthermore, the poll results reveal that although Perez 
Balladares and Carles obtained the highest preference ratings, 
they are also the candidates who obtained the highest negative 
ratings. Of polled interviewed, 31.3 percent stated they would 
not vote for Carles, another 20 percent objected to Perez 
Balladares' candidacy, 14.8 percent objected to Mireya Moscoso 
de Gruber, 7.6 percent of those interviewed said they would not 
back Blades, 3.3 percent would not support Vallarino, 1.9 
percent likewise regarding Lewis Galindo, and 1.6 percent do not 
intend to vote for Jose Salvador Munoz. 
  The Telemetro poll included interviews in 105 sectors of the 
country. In each sector 12 homes were chosen. 
  Regarding candidates for city mayor, Omaira Correa leads 
with 
a 31.5 percent preference. She is followed by Andres Vega 
Cedeno [PRD] with 21.3 percent, Ana Mae de Endara 10.3 percent, 
Isabel Corro [Labor Party] 2.1 percent, Hernan Arias [Christian 
Democratic Party] 1.3 percent, Jose Manuel Paredes [National 
Unity Mission] 1.2 percent, and Maribel Cuervo de Paredes 0.4 
percent.

  [Text] On the evening of 23 February, President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide attended, with a group of 
parliamentarians including Senate President Firmin Jean-Louis 
and Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde, a 
reception held in his honor at the Haitian Embassy in Washington 
on the eve of his visit to France which will begin on 27 
February. For the first time, the plan that was worked out by a 
group of parliamentarians with the support of the State 
Department was delivered to President Aristide in a sealed 
envelope by the former president of the lower chamber, Antoine 
Joseph, who asserted that he hopes for an answer from the head 
of state. President Aristide, who was speaking [on that 
occasion], stated that everyone knows why no government can 
function in Haiti and why it is impossible [for him] to appoint 
a new prime minister. He nevertheless asked the parliamentarians 
to forget about their political affiliations and work toward 
unity among all Haitians. 
  With this unity in mind, some of the parliamentarians have 
decided to extend their stay in Washington so they can continue 
the dialogue to find a solution to the crisis. The president has 
promised to remain in contact with them during his trip. 
  Port-au-Prince Mayor and National Front for Change and 
Democracy spokesman Evans Paul, who attended the reception, 
asked all factions represented in Washington to fuse their 
various plans into a final plan. We are all asking for a return 
to democratic order; so, let us all together try to speak with 
only one voice, Paul added. 
  President Aristide was to leave Washington on 24 February 
for 
New Hampshire, where he will depart for Paris.

  [Excerpts] Alliance [for Parliamentary Cohesion, ACP] and 
Socialist Group [GS] parliamentarians are opposed to the 
counterproposal of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. While 
supporting the plan of the parliamentary delegation that is 
negotiating in Washington, they say President Aristide must 
appoint a new prime minister to fill the power vacuum. The 
following is a report by Daly Valet: 
  [Begin recording] [Valet] [passage omitted] "But in Haiti 
the 
ACP parliamentarians do not agree with the plan proposed by 
Aristide. According to Pierre Simon Georges, the head of this 
bloc, they remain committed to the plan of the Haitian 
parliamentary delegation asking that the president of the 
country appoint a new head of government as soon as possible." 
  [Georges] "It is normal that.... The prime minister has 
resigned." Besides, the resignation was announced long before. 
The president is duty bound to fill this vacuum as soon as 
possible. But this has not been done. "So I believe the first 
point in whichever agenda, whichever plan" is the designation of 
the prime minister. "What can be included in the plan after the 
designation of the prime minister? All the other things they 
[not further identified] want." 
  [Valet] So you do not agree with Aristide's plan which 
speaks 
of the departure of the military officers first? 
  [Georges] Not at all. "I am one of the parliamentarians who 
do not agree that Cedras or any other military should step down 
if the amnesty law is not first passed. Besides, that is what 
gives me a feeling of security to discuss at the chamber as a 
deputy. That is what gives me the feeling of security to use a 
microphone to say whatever ensues from my political options." 
  [Valet] "As regards Aristide's return 10 days after the 
appointment of the head of government, Deputy Pierre Simon 
Georges says he has no objection to that, provided that head of 
government would have time to establish social peace in the 
country. But the deputy has a reservation in that he does not 
believe there can be social peace in the country 10 days after 
the appointment of a head of government. [passage omitted] 
  ``The stances are not different within the GS. Deputy 
Edmonde 
Supplice Beauzile of the Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary 
Party of Haiti [Panpra] advises that they have no comments to 
make on the plan proposed by President Aristide because GS 
President Duly Brutus signed, jointly with the parliamentary 
delegation, a plan to be delivered to Aristide. This 
parliamentary plan is supported by Panpra coordinator Serge 
Gilles, according to Deputy Beauzile.'' 
  [Beauzile] "At present, there is one member of my group who 
signed another plan. So I do not need to give my opinion about 
the plan set up by President Aristide." 
  [Valet] "So, as a parliamentarian who is affiliated to a 
political party evolving within a [political bloc], you do not 
share the outlines of this plan which provides for the return of 
Aristide 10 days after the appointment of the prime minister?" 
  [Beauzile] "Let me tell you, Daly, you know that one of the 
characteristics of the GS is our coherence. If we have made a 
statement saying that we have accepted a plan, we cannot accept 
one today, then accept another that comes tomorrow, and then 
accept another that comes the day after tomorrow. By doing so, I 
would give you an opportunity to say that I belong to an 
incoherent group." [passage omitted] 
  [Valet] "Whereas several parliamentarians in Haiti, the 
delegation of parliamentarians, the United Nations, and the U.S. 
Government are putting pressure on Aristide to appoint a new 
prime minister and whereas, for his part, the president has made 
a counterproposal in which he asks for the departure of the 
military officials before he chooses a new head of government, 
the office at the Senate of the Republic that is presided over 
by Bernard Sansaricq is working toward the establishment of a 
new government, an exceptional government, according to what he 
said." [end recording]

  [Text] According to Senator Bernard Sansaricq, for some 
officers of the Army General Staff, the Governors Island accord 
and the New York pact are considered null and void. The 
legislators, opposed to President Aristide, are reportedly ready 
to vote for the formation of a new government. It would be, 
according to Sen. Sansaricq, an ad hoc government, the duties of 
which are provided for in Article 111 of the 1987 Constitution. 
  On the question of Article 149, Bernard Sansaricq noted the 
refusal by the president-in-exile to immediately nominate a new 
prime minister in compliance with Article 148. According to the 
president of one of the two offices of the Senate, it is urgent 
to form the ad hoc government to solve the political deadlock. 
  Bernard Sansaricq, who asserts that he met with the Army 
General Staff, revealed that some officers of that institution 
regard the Governors Island accord and the New York pact null 
and void. He indicated, however, that General Cedras did not 
openly express himself on the matter. 
  On the subject of the commander in chief, invited to the 
parliament at the beginning of the week, Bernard Sansaricq still 
expresses indignance at the general's refusal to answer the 
senators' questions. Sansaricq considers it a lack of respect 
for the Senate of the Republic. Mr. Sansaricq also explained 
that he did not formally ask for the resignation of Gen. Cedras, 
but would be ready to do so if it were a Senate decision.

  [Text] A drug-trafficking network led by a Colombian man 
was broken over the past few days. According to the head of the 
Information and Joint Coordination Center [CICC], Colonel 
Antoine Atouriste, the head of the drug network, Juan Alberto 
Ramirez (Azurio), reportedly linked to the Cali cartel, was 
arrested on 11 February at his home in (Pegguy-Ville). Five kg 
of cocaine, weapons, ammunition, and $100,000 were seized in 
Ramirez (Azurio)'s home. 
  Two other men from Colombia, two from The Bahamas, and one 
from the Dominican Republic, linked to this network, which is 
considered the most active in recent months in Haiti, were also 
apprehended in the north of the country and in Port-au-Prince, 
according to the head of the CICC.

  [Text] The antidrug brigade in Haiti netted a new catch of 
drug dealers in Port-au-Prince where about 10 kg of cocaine were 
seized on 24 February at the Port-au-Prince Airport and three 
persons linked to drug trafficking were arrested. Jean Max Blanc 
filed a report: 
  [Begin recording in Creole] On 24 February, the antidrug 
police in Haiti arrested a voodoo priestess who was trying to 
travel with 12 kg of cocaine. The police arrested Mrs. Fritz 
Betty Obin as she was attempting to travel to the United States 
aboard American Airlines. Mrs. Obin confessed that she was 
surprised by her arrest because she uses powerful magic to help 
the drug pass through. She admitted that from 4 May 1993 to 7 
January 1994, she had already traveled with 30 kg of cocaine. 
The amount that the antidrug police seized would have brought 
this amount up to 42 kg that the voodoo priestess would passed 
through. 
  The national antidrug brigade advises that last week, six 
foreigners, two men from Colombia, two from The Bahamas, one 
from the Dominican Republic, and one from Venezuela of Colombian 
origin were arrested. At that time, the police seized more than 
$100,000 U.S. 
  Police seized five kg of cocaine in the house of Juan 
Alberto 
Ramirez (Azujo), alias Pedro. According to one of the antidrug 
brigade authorities, Mr.(Azujo) is reportedly the head of a 
cartel sending drugs to the United States through Haiti. 
  A kg of cocaine is worth more than $10,000 U.S. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro has met with 
representatives of the Cypriot Chamber of Commerce headed by its 
president, Alexis Galanos, who is also president of the Cypriot 
Congress' Cyprus-Cuba Friendship Group. 
  The Cypriot delegation that is visiting our country at the 
invitation of the National Assembly of the People's Government 
[ANPP] held a lengthy meeting with the commander in chief, 
exchanging opinions and information on various international 
issues as well as on the respective situations in Cuba and 
Cyprus. 
  Galanos took advantage of this opportunity to say that to 
the 
extent that his country has always enjoyed the firm support of 
Cuba during the most difficult times, the people of Cyprus now 
wish to express their solidarity with the Cuban struggle to 
defend its revolution, through their presence in the country. 
  In addition to the Cypriot deputies, (Georgios 
Paraguiotides), Cypriot consul to Cuba, and ANPP President 
Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada were also present.
