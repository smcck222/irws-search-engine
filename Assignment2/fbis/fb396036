<F P=106> [Article by Armando Villanueva] </F>
  [Text] The Armed Forces on 28 February said that they would 
not oppose the virtual privatization of the Honduran 
Telecommunications Enterprise (Hondutel) should the government 
reach a political decision to do so, but their Commander in 
Chief General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir pointed out that this 
must be a "well made" decision, because it involves an 
institution that is profitable to the State. 
  The Armed Forces have managed Hondutel since its inception 
under the pretext that telecommunications is a national security 
matter; and therefore, they must not be in private hands. 
  Discua Elvir discussed the thorny issue at a meeting with 
high-ranking officers and President Carlos Roberto Reina. At a 
news conference at the Government House, the number one man in 
the military institution said that the sale of Hondutel depends 
on a governmental political decision, because the State owns the 
enterprise. He said: "There must be national awareness, and 
there must be a political decision to do it. Hondutel is very 
profitable to the State. I think that the government will have 
the last word through a political decision." 
  The military chief pointed out that the Armed Forces "do not 
have a positive or negative opinion" on the sale of Hondutel. 
Discua added that personally, however, he has always believed 
that the State must control telecommunications in any country, 
"because it is a State duty." He added that "the State always 
has the responsibility of controlling a country's 
telecommunications," regardless of who manages or owns them. 
However, "if the government makes a decision and has political 
willingness, I believe that such a decision will be the wisest 
decision," he added. 
  Discua Elvir recalled that President Reina said that if this 
transaction materialized, it will be done in the clearest manner 
possible. The Armed Forces chief stressed that there would be 
"absolute honesty in this privatization process," but it must be 
a "well made" decision, because the enterprise is profitable. 
  He added that the military does not control Hondutel, 
because 
its board of directors is made up of several governmental 
sectors, including the Ministries of Communications, Public 
Works and Transportation; Government and Justice; Defense; and 
Finance, and even the Comptroller General's Office. 
  Discua said that Hondutel's manager, a career military 
official, only follows the board's decisions. The military 
chief added that no national economic group is able to buy 
Hondutel. However, he maintained that the Military Welfare 
Institute (IPM) is willing to "participate" in the purchase of 
Hondutel, in case it is privatized. He added that the sale will 
require an "immediate payment" so that the State will benefit 
from the transaction. 
  Meanwhile, Gen. Discua Elvir denied that the Armed Forces 
are 
negotiating with President Reina a budget increase in exchange 
for their approval of voluntary military service. He said: "As 
commander in chief, I would be ashamed to make such a proposal 
to President Reina."

  [Text] Managua, 1 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- A government source 
confirmed on Tuesday the first 100 "recontras" from the 3-80 
Northern Front will surrender their rifles on 2 March, thereby 
beginning the disarmament process scheduled to conclude on 8 
April. 
  Maria Cristina Arguello, Nicaraguan government ministry 
spokeswoman, told ACAN-EFE "everything is set, and the necessary 
conditions are given" for the disarmament. 
  The government and the 3-80 Northern Front, led by Jose 
Angel 
Talavera, alias "El Chacal," signed a four-point agreement last 
week which establishes the mechanism that will be used to begin 
disarming the rebels and possibly end the conflict in northern 
Nicaragua. 
  Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta and delegates from the 
Army and verification and follow-up commissions met with rebel 
leaders on Tuesday in Quilali, on the Honduran border, to 
establish whether the agreements had been fulfilled. 
  "It was a preparatory meeting to finalize the details of the 
first phase of the demobilization and disarmament process," 
which will take place in the village of Caulatu, Arguello 
explained. 
  The second contingent of "recontras" (approximately 250 men) 
is scheduled to surrender its weapons on 16 March, and the 
remaining members of that unconventional force, including its 
general staff, will surrender on 8 April. 
  According to military sources the 380 Northern Front, the 
foremost armed group, is formed by approximately 500 people, 
mostly former members of the "contra" who fought against the 
Sandinist government. 
  Argentine Sergio Caramagna, general coordinator of the OAS 
International Commission of Support and Verification (CIAV-OAS), 
has said the 3-80 Northern Front's demobilization "will mark the 
beginning of the dismantling of armed violence" in Nicaragua. 
  Nevertheless, in statements to ACAN-EFE the diplomat warned 
if broad social and economic programs are not implemented in the 
northern regions, there may be a resurgence of armed violence. 
  "Broadly speaking, peace is coming of age" in Nicaragua, 
"but 
I believe the time has come to attack the root of the conflict," 
Caramagna stressed. 
  He also expressed concern over two "recontra" leaders known 
as "Northiel" and "Charro" who did not sign the recent peace 
agreements signed by "Chacal" and the government. 
  The Army has reiterated it will fight the groups that have 
not agreed to surrender their weapons, adding the groups led by 
"Northiel" and "Charro" are formed by approximately 100 men only. 
  President Violeta Chamorro urged the people last week to 
forget the chapter of armed violence in Nicaragua, and she 
called for a reconciliation among the Nicaraguan people. 
  The "recontra" problem emerged in Nicaragua after Chamorro 
took office almost four years ago. Thousands of the 22,000 
former "contras" rearmed themselves because they were unhappy 
with the government, which, in their opinion, had failed to 
fulfill the agreements for their return to civilian life. 
  Sandinist Legislator Carlos Gallo, president of the National 
Assembly Human Rights Commission, will attend the disarmament 
ceremonies of the first 100 "recontras" from the 3-80 Northern 
Front. 
  Gallo said the Chamorro government "must now fulfill its 
pledge to present a new social and economic emergency program" 
for the rebels' definitive return to civilian life.

  [Text] In what represents a world record, a Spanish 
consortium has paid $2,002,179,198 for the Peruvian Telephone 
Company [CPT] and Entelperu [National Telecommunications 
Enterprise of Peru], quadrupling the established base price of 
$535 million. The successful bidding company will also have to 
invest $1 billion, within a five-year period, to install more 
than 1 million telephone lines in our country. 
  [Begin unidentified official recording, in progress] 
...whose 
bid totals $2,002,179,198. [end recording] 
  In what represents an amazing world record for 
telecommunications privatization, the Telephone Company of Peru 
[Telefonica del Peru] consortium, headed by the Telephone 
Company of Spain [Telefonica de Espana], bid $2,002,179,198 for 
35 percent of CPT shares and 35 percent of Entelperu shares, 
thus quadrupling the base price, estimated at $535 million. 
  The bid greatly surpassed the two bids presented by other 
two 
consortia: Peruvian Telecommunications Company 
[Telecomunicaciones del Peru], headed by the U.S. company GTE, 
which offered to pay $803 million; and Peruvian 
Telecommunications Holding Limited, which offered to pay 
$857,142,857. 
  [Begin recording] [Telephone Company of Spain representative 
Jorge Santillana] The first variable that we have introduced is 
to bet on Peru as a country with a telecommunications 
development potential that is part of Peru's economic 
development. This was one of the basic variables. According to 
these basic variables, we belong to an international group that 
nowadays has established itself in Venezuela, Argentina, Chile, 
Puerto Rico, and Colombia. 
  For us, our investment in Peru, to a certain extent, 
complements a market that we have. We have bet on the 
development potential. 
  [CPT President Antonio Paucar] We never dreamed of such a 
quantity of money entering. I believe Peru never dreamed... 
[pauses] Never before in Peruvian history has such a quantity of 
money been received for investment in private companies. 
  [Unidentified reporter] When will the successful bidding 
company be finally paying the quantity...? 
  [Paucar, interrupting] It should be paying in about 30 days. 
[end recording] 
  During the five-year period during which it will hold a 
monopoly on the (?Sifa) telephone system and the long distance 
service, the Spanish consortium, along with the Peruvian 
companies Brewery Backus and Johnston, Inc., Wiese Bank, and 
Granda y Montero, will install 1 million telephone lines, 
involving an investment of $1.5 billion [as heard]. 
  [Begin Santillana recording] We will fulfill our promise. 
We will meet the terms established in the bidding conditions. 
[end recording] 
  CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] President Jaime 
Yoshiyama, who attended the ceremony, emphasized the 
transaction's amount. 
  [Begin Yoshiyama recording] In addition to this amount, the 
$2 billion that the company will pay, $1 billion will be 
invested to install the new telephones. This represents about 
$3 billion that are entering Peru. I believe this represents a 
success for which the public must be grateful to the 
Privatizations Committee. [end recording] 
  For his part, after expressing his total satisfaction over 
the success of the Telecommunications Company's auction, 
President Alberto Fujimori pointed out that, with this amount, 
the (?balance) will be guaranteed. He said about $1.4 billion 
from CPT's and Entelperu's sale will be allocated for the 
enhancement of social programs. 
  [Begin Fujimori recording] This is good news because it is 
not merely a circumstantial investment, a so-called speculative 
capital. It actually is a long-term investment, based on our 
country's established legal stability for foreign investors. 
  Now then, in a nutshell, in order to... [pauses] [words 
indistinct]. This represents a very clear sign that the 
privatization process, our economy's modernization, is working. 
Therefore, their telephone company will arrive in Peru. It is 
clearly specified on the contract: 1,453 towns that did not have 
telephone lines will have one in the period established by the 
contract. 
  In this regard, I am satisfied with the fact that this 
privatization has been such an overwhelming success. In fact, 
this will guarantee our balance. Of this amount, $610 million 
will be invested in the purchase of new [word indistinct] for 
(?microwaves) and the total purchase amount, namely $1.391 
billion [as heard], will go directly to the treasury. This 
obviously will allow us to enhance all our social programs.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Rafael Caldera at Miraflores Palace in </F>
Caracas -- live] 
  [Text] People of Venezuela: The government I head is 
marking one month in office; a short month because February has 
only 28 days. It included carnival, and although the government 
worked every carnival day, more than half of the country was 
absent from normal work during carnival. 
  As we mark our first month, I feel obliged to report to the 
country the main aspects of the tasks we must carry out and the 
measures we have adopted to face the situation. I will not tire 
my compatriots -- the inhabitants of Venezuela -- by listing all 
the bad things we have encountered. I can only say that the 
situation was worse than we had imagined. 
  The country must realize that there have been many 
difficulties but it must also be aware that from the very 
beginning we assumed the firm determination of taking on these 
responsibilities. Bringing order at home is a priority that is 
very difficult to achieve when the home involved is large and 
complex and when it is in disarray, as is currently the case in 
Venezuela. 
  We are making great efforts to bring order at home. In all 
sectors of public administration we have even had to resort to 
partial restrictions of economic guarantees. The way this 
measure was welcomed shows that the country understands the 
situation we are facing. This measure was issued urgently to 
stop confusion about the value-added tax, VAT; to stop applying 
the VAT at the consumer level until we established new taxes as 
part of a fairer fiscal reform that will place the heaviest 
burden of public expenses on segments of the population that are 
better suited to endure them. 
  I wish to reaffirm that the suspension of such guarantees 
did 
not seek to establish foreign exchange controls or decree a 
maxi-devaluation or any other similar measures that I 
categorically rejected during my inauguration as president of 
the Republic. I wish to add that the powers that the Executive 
Branch assumed after having restricted economic guarantees will 
be exercised with moderation and responsibly only when they are 
strictly necessary to seek economic stability, which is an 
important goal that we must pursue. 
  Upon my reaching the government, the most urgent problem we 
found was the fiscal deficit. Perhaps it is not the most 
important one. The country has many more serious problems, but 
this is indeed the most urgent. It calls for immediate actions 
[obligaciones de immediatismo] that somewhat make us lose our 
perspectives of primary medium- and long-term goals. 
  It is essential that we deal with the fiscal deficit not 
only 
to allow the state to continue to operate and exist, but also to 
tackle the disease of inflation, which is a major disease that 
is undermining all social segments, especially the poorest. 
This situation could worsen if there is no solution to the 
fiscal deficit problem. 
  We started by cutting spending. It is so difficult to deal 
with a budget of 1.4 trillion bolivares and find out that many 
expenses are fixed, that they cannot be changed -- for example, 
our foreign debt commitments. Other expenses cannot be cut due 
to humanitarian, social, or justice reasons. That is the case 
of salaries because real salaries actually decrease, and in 
general, they prove to be insufficient for most public sector 
servants. 
  There are other expenditures that create social 
conditions.... [pauses] making reductions almost impossible to 
face. And then there are other expenditures in public sector 
entities that are not under the control of the Executive Branch. 
At any rate, the effort made this week has for the time being 
entailed a reduction of 105.858 billion bolivares that in some 
way contributes to lowering the deficit and, most of all, 
provides a big example, because we are beginning by cutting the 
presidency's spending to be able to have -- as we do -- the 
moral authority to ask all sectors and all who receive benefits 
from the Treasury to make their share of sacrifice. If all of 
us are not ready to do what is indispensable, the situation 
would be irreparable. 
  As for fiscal revenue, we now have the problem of 
collection. 
We have evidence that most taxes levied in Venezuela based on 
current laws are not collected for reasons of incompetence, 
corruption, or technical deficiencies, and many other kinds of 
deficiencies regarding the tax collection system. That is why 
we ordered the creation of an autonomous service for managing 
and controlling taxes, as it exists in other countries that have 
had the same experience and that provided us with instructions 
and indications that have served us in good stead in facing this 
issue. We firmly hope we will be able to increase revenues 
substantially and this will be a major step toward lowering the 
fiscal deficit. 
  However, we also have to increase revenues, mostly because 
we 
are determined -- and we have proved it and are reaffirming it 
-- to eliminate the VAT at the retail level, as it is a very 
heavy burden and a source of corruption that according to some 
could become similar to the experience with Recadi [Differential 
Exchange System]. We are, therefore, going to replace this tax 
with fairer taxes that fall on those who can pay. The tax on 
luxury items, for example, starts at 10 percent, we add another 
10 percent, and another 10 percent later, based on the nature of 
the luxury items that are purchased and that do not correspond 
to the country's difficult situation. 
  This is a tax on wholesales, and it is selective. It serves 
to place the State's need to obtain revenues to meet its needs 
on fairer grounds. The amendment on the income tax, which will 
go up to 34 percent, and which is an effort we are requiring -- 
and is required in other countries because developed countries 
have a very high income tax. [sentence as heard] We are going 
to do away with the excuse that tax payers often had to say: I 
do not pay taxes because they are stolen. We now have the 
guarantee that the tax money will not be stolen but will be 
administered with utmost seriousness because the struggle 
against corruption is a fundamental objective of this 
government. We are not going to yield or fail in any way. 
  For that reason, the taxes that are collected will be taxes 
for public spending and the service of the community. The tax 
on banking debits, which will be a necessity this year because 
the income tax will not be collected this year but the next, is 
a temporary tax until 31 December 1994, as has happened in other 
countries of the world. The finance minister will submit this 
bill to the Chamber of Deputies, which he has asked to receive 
him next week to submit the carefully drafted bills. With 
regard to these bills, we hope the representatives of the blocs 
that comprise the Legislative Branch will be receptive to them 
as most of them have pledged to be. 
  This fiscal deficit problem, however, got more complicated 
with the Banco Latino disaster, which represents the tailspin of 
the moral crisis Venezuela has experienced in moral, economic, 
and every other respect. 
  The Banco Latino case is very serious and the large number 
of Venezuelans and foreigners victimized by that institution's 
incorrect and criminal operations is really amazing and a source 
of deep pain. 
  The government has not been indifferent to this at all. From 
the very beginning, it has adopted every possible measure and 
procedure. We even asked the Senate to ratify, in keeping with 
the new Banking Law, the appointment of the new bank 
superintendent and the new Deposit Guarantee Fund, Fogade, 
president and we are confidently awaiting their ratification. 
  We appointed an Intervention Board, which all parties 
involved in this problem have welcomed with great respect and 
enthusiasm, I would say. I learned that the Intervention Board 
has already made preliminary studies, and therefore, it is ready 
to start revitalizing Banco Latino in approximately 30 days, 
when it will be fully operational. 
  We chose to revitalize it rather than liquidate it because, 
based on precedents in Venezuela and elsewhere, liquidation is 
completely negative. Therefore, this is a clear path to 
ensuring that those who have interests, deposits, and their 
livelihoods in Banco Latino will find a way to transform their 
rights [derechos] into stock or assets [pertenencias] in an 
establishment that will be revitalized and reconfigured, and 
well-managed. The pressure needed to get debtors to pay up is 
already being applied. 
  By the way, there must be a collaboration by all the 
branches 
in public power, which we have had. Congress is issuing an 
emergency law and the executive branch has voiced its views, 
some of which have been accepted. We hope this step, taken by 
Congress, will be fully satisfactory. At any rate, we are 
willing to do whatever is necessary to ensure that it will be 
truly efficient. 
  The Judicial Branch has also played a role. We are waiting 
for the official who knows about the Banco Latino case and who, 
according to the bill, would be the only person to intervene in 
this matter -- we have many good references of her -- to 
announce her decisions. The government will not point out the 
culprits, however, the culprits that the Judicial Branch 
designate, will be punished. 
  We will place all the state's power at the service of 
justice 
to ensure, if warranted, the establishment of penal punishments 
and civilian punishments determined by the tribunals, as well as 
precautionary measures that are indispensable to recovering, as 
soon as possible, the money lost in the Banco Latino cataclysm. 
  We are, therefore, perfectly willing to offer our decided 
support, without any distinctions, to provisions issued by the 
Judicial Branch on this matter. I must say that the Central 
Bank of Venezuela has helped us face the crisis. It has helped 
by doing perhaps a little more than what is normally expected 
from this institution. 
  I think, I am convinced that the country, all interested 
parties, the depositors, checking account holders, and those who 
had trust funds and interests at Banco Latino can rest assured 
we are doing everything we can to overcome this terrible 
situation in the most satisfactory manner possible. 
  Of course, the Banco Latino cataclysm, as I called it, has 
influenced the financial system in general. The concern of the 
government and all public sector organizations has been to 
prevent similar situations from occurring at other banks to 
which we gave, are giving, want to give, and will give all the 
necessary protection to prevent the disaster that a financial 
system catastrophe would entail for the country. 
  Fortunately, Venezuelans have been very prudent, and amid 
the 
uneasiness, anguish, and desperation that many feel, the actions 
taken have built trust and created hope in the institutions and 
systems that make up the Venezuelan economy. 
  This is all part of the economic policy. A medium- and 
long-term economic policy has already started to materialize in 
the tax reforms and, as we had said, its main concern will be 
centered on the people and the struggle against poverty. 
Although we have been unable to implement measures to produce 
effective results immediately, the fact that we suspended a tax 
that was going to have direct negative effects on the 
grass-roots sectors and that we have presented Congress with a 
proposal for a tax system -- the weight of which falls on the 
privileged sectors -- clearly shows the path we aim to take. 
Our concern is, of course, to fight the scourge of inflation 
and, to this end, our efforts to remedy the fiscal deficit are 
fundamental. 
  To the extent possible, we do not want to reduce social 
expenses. The subsidies that are currently being paid will be 
maintained; the government's main obligations in the struggle 
against poverty will not only be maintained but we will attempt 
to increase them. We will implement a persistent policy to 
support grass-roots neighborhoods so that they can have running 
water, housing, and necessary comforts of a modern life. Of 
course, it is an ambitious, extensive program which will have to 
start at the beginning but, I am sure, it will be received with 
faith, confidence, and satisfaction by the Venezuelan 
grass-roots sectors. 
  This economic policy becomes a commitment of solidarity. We 
cannot carry it out if we do not obtain a fundamental agreement 
among all the sectors. We have begun talks with businessmen, 
farmers, small and medium-size industrial producers, and workers 
to try to achieve a number of aspirations that have to be 
obtained through consensus. The development minister has 
announced the negotiation he carried out with commercial sectors 
to avoid the unrestrained hikes of prices, which are already 
pretty high. We have, however, had to decree a special measure, 
postponing price control with regard to medicine, which is one 
of the most delicate, serious, and acute aspects of the current 
situation. Thus, we are optimistic in the sense that the 
country's receptivity encourages us to believe that there is 
confidence in the future. We still have to go through a very 
difficult stage. 
  Currently, we cannot increase investments as we would like 
to. We plan to encourage private investment by offering 
stability and by effectively controlling inflation, which is one 
of the most significant obstacles any investor can encounter. 
In light of this, we are motivated by a commitment of 
togetherness which fills us with faith and confidence. 
  We have encountered numerous problems and I would briefly 
like to state that with respect to the military officers 
indicted as a result of the events that took place on 4 February 
and 27 November 1992, these individuals have received the 
treatment that was announced from the beginning. The 
disposition to dismiss the charges against all of them is still 
in effect. Now, I would like to clearly state that I believe 
that those officers who adopted an unquestionably political 
position and are members of political groups should decide not 
to rejoin the Armed Forces. The Constitution says that the 
Armed Forces are apolitical as well as nondeliberating entities 
and I am willing to respect and ensure this principle. 
  As commander in chief of the Armed Forces, I would not 
commit the blunder of authorizing a political group that is 
organized and active in the political arena to enter into the 
Armed Forces. Instead, I open the way for it to participate in 
civilian life and exercise all the rights that the rest of the 
citizens have. I think the most honorable thing for an officer 
who is passing from military to civilian life would be to do so 
at his own request. I have not wanted to resort to other 
mechanisms that would not provide them with an honorable 
discharge as they have the right to demand and as befits them 
because of their own conscience, rank, and military situation. 
Therefore, I am willing to continue granting stays of 
proceedings. Some, perhaps many officers may be able to return 
to service because their particular case perfectly well 
authorizes them to do so. But I really ask those who are 
involved in political activity, and who are not hiding this but 
are publicly showing this, to admit that the most honorable and 
advisable thing for them and for everyone would be to have them 
request, by their own decision, their return to civilian life. 
  To conclude, I want to state that the decentralization 
process that began in the last few years will be continued by my 
administration, but it will be decentralization not 
disintegration. The national government is willing to maintain 
the best relations with the state governors and municipal 
mayors, but it is also ready to exercise and maintain the 
prerogatives that the Constitution gives it. Those prerogatives 
are in no way for the benefit of the national government but for 
the fulfillment of the serious responsibility it has to the 
country. 
  I tell my fellow countrymen that I reiterate my faith in my 
country, that I reiterate my faith in my people, that I 
reiterate my confidence in them, and that I am always ready to 
clearly and frankly tell them the truth. We are not going to 
conceal anything. We are going to listen to all complaints. We 
have begun a process of dialogue. I received and spoke with the 
Banco Latino demonstrators who came to the doors of Miraflores. 
I have begun a dialogue with the university rectors to bring 
about a solution of the pending problems. We have begun a 
dialogue with the political parties represented in Congress and 
I also hope it will be productive. This dialogue shows a 
willingness to achieve what I mentioned earlier: the commitment 
to solidarity. The problem belongs to everyone. Everyone has 
an obligation. We all have to make an effort. We all have to 
make a sacrifice and I am sure we are going to do so and we can 
all, in solidarity, give a good account to the Venezuelan 
people. Good evening.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ernesto Samper Pizano, aspirant to the </F>
Liberal Party presidential candidacy: "Chiapas, Caracas, and 
Ciudad Bolivar"] 
  [Text] Following the advances achieved in the last decade, 
Latin American democracy will be faced with two serious threats 
before the century ends. They are the crisis in governability 
and the social costs of the "apertura." I will deal with the 
first of these on another occasion in the near future. This 
threat has to do with the fact that the basic elements of 
democracy no longer have credibility in the minds of the 
citizens because of the inefficiency of government, the 
dysfunctional bureaucracy, and administrative corruption. This 
situation paves the way for the "authoritarian temptation" that 
has already produced a coup in Peru, another attempted coup in 
Guatemala, and, according to recent information, the plotting of 
yet another in Brazil. 
  The second threat, which has to do with the social costs of 
the "apertura," has again become the focus of analysis because 
of what has been called the "Chiapas scandal," simply a new 
version of the "Caracazo" in Venezuela four years ago. In both 
cases, violence has erupted as an expression of the 
dissatisfaction of the citizens with the conditions of their 
lives. 
  The Latin American countries have carried out a series of 
desirable and essential economic reforms in an effort to deal 
with the new realities in the economy and the politics of the 
world. As a result of these reforms, this continent can look 
toward the future with optimism, because the attention of the 
international community has begun to be focused on countries 
like Chile, Mexico, and Argentina in which important 
macroeconomic results are beginning to be visible as a 
consequence of the reforms undertaken. 
  The people do not feel that they are partners in the 
"apertura." Nothing could be a more dangerous threat to the 
process itself, which must continue, and to democratic stability 
itself, than the violent rebellion that shook Chiapas a few days 
ago, or that which shook Caracas when President Carlos Andres 
Perez launched the economic adjustment in 1989. The challenge of 
the new developmental model cannot be limited to an increase in 
growth, but must extend to a search for greater equity, and to 
social development. 
  In the United States itself, the subject of income 
distribution and the sharing of the benefits of growth was a 
central focus of the electoral debate in the most recent 
campaign, and it was one of the main themes in the program of 
the man who is now president. The economic policies pursued in 
the past decade have widened the disparities between the richer 
and the poorer classes, causing losses for the latter in terms 
of consumption levels, and today this is the principal concern 
of President Clinton and the first lady. 
  Some countries have made major efforts to increase social 
investments with a view to covering the costs of the "apertura" 
and guaranteeing continuity for the model. In Chile, where there 
are poverty levels of up to 40 percent, social investments have 
been increased to 15 percent of the GDP [gross domestic 
product], without affecting the process of internationalization 
in any way. 
  The document entitled "Social Reform and Poverty," which was 
published last year by the IDB [Inter-American Development 
Bank], says that social reform is indispensable if increases in 
productivity are to be guaranteed such as to allow proper 
incorporation in the international markets. What must be done is 
to ensure that the Latin American economies export productivity 
instead of poverty, low salaries, and inadequate living 
conditions. 
  Colombia is no exception where the deterioration of the 
social indicators in recent years is concerned. The social 
policy implemented beginning in the decade just past has not 
been effective in bringing the benefits of economic growth to 
the people, despite the fact that Colombia has done better than 
the majority of the other nations in this hemisphere. In the 
large cities, the informal sector accounts for 60.3 percent of 
the labor market, a much higher figure than the average for the 
region. Income in the peasant sector has declined in the last 
five years by more than 15 percent, and the number of citizens 
living in absolute poverty has risen. The gap between the rural 
sector and the cities, which had been narrowing in the decade of 
the 1970's, recently began to widen again. 
  Greater competitive capacity for the Colombian economy 
within 
the international context will require an effort in the realm of 
education to improve the conditions that enable human resources 
to be productive. Training and advancement programs for 
individuals are equally essential, so that they can work 
productively. In addition, policies for acquiring and producing 
technology are needed. The country must commit itself to a 
strategy whereby it devotes greater resources to education. 
Otherwise, the economic "apertura" will not produce the expected 
benefits, and the few benefits that are produced will be poorly 
distributed. The creation of productive, stable, and well-paid 
jobs, and the development of the new Colombian man who enjoys 
better housing, health, and education must become the great 
triumph achieved by the internationalization of the economy. 
  A modern social policy is essential if Colombia is to be 
able 
to achieve two priority goals--peace and equity. And the country 
now has a historic opportunity to achieve this, to think right 
now about the people. The "apertura" and the oil bonanza offer 
tools that for decades were not within our reach. This must be 
the hour of the people. If we fail to take advantage of this 
opportunity, we will be creating the possibility that the next 
chapter of violent protest will occur in Ciudad Bolivar, in 
Bogota, in Aguablanca, in Cali, in the black quarter of 
Barranquilla, or anywhere else. If, on the other hand, we make 
the decision to invest in the people and to make "the social 
issue" the priority of the new government and of the entire 
nation, we will in truth be establishing the foundations for the 
prosperous and peaceful society for which we all yearn.

<F P=106> [Article by Jaime Mejia Mazuera and Clara Ines Rueda of EL </F>
TIEMPO's economic staff] 
  [Text] In recent days two of the biggest privatizations 
ever reported in Colombia have been finalized. The Banco de 
Colombia [Bank of Colombia] has been transferred to a group of 
Cali businessmen, and the cellular telephone service was turned 
over to private operators. These two deals generated revenues of 
about $1.7 billion for the government. 
  What is this government's record on privatizations? Since 
early 1991 state holdings in about 15 companies have been 
transferred to the private sector, earning the state a little 
over 1.1 trillion pesos. 
  However, these were not large privatizations. In most cases 
they were small enterprises in which the IFI [Industrial 
Development Institute] held shares. In the last two years, the 
IFI sold its shares in six enterprises for approximately 12.398 
billion pesos. 
  The state has been successful, though, in turning over to 
private enterprise some major areas that were traditionally 
considered the state's responsibility: railways, highways, 
ports, expansion of the gas system, and social security. 
  It is estimated that in the next few years the private 
sector 
will invest close to $392 billion in plans to rehabilitate the 
railway system, highway construction projects, ports, and the 
construction of gas pipelines. 
  In addition, for electricity generating projects, private 
companies plan to invest resources that will easily exceed 592 
billion pesos. 
  By doing so, the state will no longer be involved in 
providing public services and it will turn over shares to 
private investors, who should apparently be more efficient. 
  That is, in essence, the primordial objective of 
privatization in Colombia. They want to turn over part of the 
economy that the state now runs in order to promote competition 
and the free market. 
  In other Latin American countries, governments have been 
forced to sell state enterprises to shrink the gap between 
public spending needs and revenues or to cover massive external 
debts. 
  In Argentina, for example, between September 1992 and 
October 
1993, 45 enterprises were privatized. This easily produced $7.5 
billion fresh dollars for the government. And the government no 
longer has to transfer about $2.1 billion a year from the budget 
to prop up bankrupt public enterprises. 
<H5>  The Objective </H5>
  In Colombia, privatization was not undertaken to make the 
state smaller. If that were the objective, the results would be 
dismal: public spending, 24 percent of the economy's total 
production of goods and services or GDP [gross domestic product] 
in 1988, will be up to 30 percent in 1994. This means that the 
state has grown. 
  Here the plan seeks to concentrate government action on 
activities like justice and security that, for obvious reasons, 
cannot be turned over to the private sector. 
  The numbers speak for themselves: defense and security 
spending have risen from 1.9 percent of the GDP in 1990 to 2.5 
percent last year. Military investments were up 82 percent. 
  Given the spending increase, the revenues from privatization 
will help to maintain sound finances; the state will be able to 
pay its debts without difficulty. 
  Nevertheless, turning certain activities like health care, 
pensions, and public services over to private companies does 
entail some risk. Private investors will take the profitable 
part of the business, and the state could be left with the 
obligation to handle sectors that do not generate profits. 
<H3>  Where Privatization Now Stands 
Banks Sold </H3>
  The biggest banking reprivatization took place this week: 
the 
Banco de Colombia was sold for a total of 401 billion pesos in 
simultaneous transactions on the three stock markets. 
  Its new owners are Isaac and Jaime Gilinski, who own 75 
percent of the shares, bank employees and retirees, and small 
investors. 
  Colombia's banking system began its round of privatizations 
in 1991 with the sale of the Banco de los Trabajadores [Workers 
Bank] to the Mercantile Bank of Venezuela for 3.225 billion 
pesos. Then the Tequendama Bank was acquired by the Construction 
Bank of Venezuela and Intercon Financial Bank of Aruba for 
20.723 billion. In addition, the Banco de Comercio [Bank of 
Commerce] was sold to the Luis Carlos Sarmiento organization, to 
employees, and other investors. 
  Next month the privatization of Corpavi [Savings and Housing 
Loans Corporation], the Banco del Estado [State Bank], and the 
Banco Popular [Peoples Bank] will begin. 
<H5>  Road Construction Projects </H5>
  The system of building highways through licensing 
arrangements is going to surge ahead this year: the government 
has 20 projects ready to be turned over to the private sector, 
and it is studying another 11 projects. About 3,000 kilometers 
of roadways will be built with an investment of about $1.25 
billion. This will rehabilitate 40 percent of Colombia's road 
system. 
  There are plans to restore highways: the major road system 
and access roads for major cities, like the road between Bogota 
and Meta. Other plans cover the road between Medellin and the 
Rionegro Valley; Espinal and Neiva; La Paila, Armenia, and 
Calarca. 
  In terms of construction, the plans include expanding 
roadways in places with heavy vehicle traffic. These are 
projects like the highway between Bogota and Villavicencio; the 
Perimetal de la Sabana; the road between Bogota and Puerto 
Salgar; and the Guataquia River bridge. 
  During 1993, bids for two projects were awarded: the 
construction of the Buga-Tulua-La Paila roads and the 
rehabilitation of the road between Barranquilla and Cienaga. 
  Now under study are a second road between Armenia, Pereira, 
and Manizales, and the bypass between Girardot and Ibague. 
<H5>  Electrical Sector </H5>
  Although the electrical sector's major privatizations still 
remain to be done, three private initiatives have already been 
implemented in a sector that had been considered to belong 
exclusively to the public domain: generating energy. 
  The first successful private generating project was 
developed 
by Proelectrica in Cartagena: a 90-megawatt plant was installed 
in the Mamonal industrial zone with a $60 million investment. 
  Then the CCI [Colombian Industrial Consortium] and Spain's 
Sevillan Electricity Group invested $150 million in building the 
Flores thermal power plant in Barranquilla. This plant has a 
100-megawatt capacity. 
  The most recent project was upgrading Termobarranquilla 
[Barranquilla Power Plant], so it can generate 750 megawatts. 
The investment was $520 million. Corelca [Electric Corporation 
of the Atlantic Coast] joined with Distral and the private 
Swiss-Swedish consortium ABB [Asea Brown Boveri] for this 
project. 
  The next step will be the sale of the Betania Hydroelectric 
Power Plant for a price close to $300 million. 
<H5>  Ports and Railroads </H5>
  Transportation is one of the sectors that has undergone the 
greatest structural modifications in the privatization process 
initiated by the government. 
  The National Railroads and Ports of Colombia have ceased to 
exist. The assets of both entities were placed in corporate 
liability funds, and the management of rail transport and the 
ports has been turned over to the private sector. 
  For the railroads, the government created Ferrovias 
[National 
Railroads Enterprise], through which it will channel resources 
to improve the track and stations. 
  The STF [Railroad Transport Company] has begun to provide 
service. 
  For the ports, cargo management has been turned over to the 
regional port companies located in each of the maritime 
terminals (Santa Marta, Barranquilla, Cartagena, Buenaventura, 
and Tumaco).

<H5>  Bottlenecks </H5>
  Privatizing is not easy. There have been failures in 
Colombia, so some problems the government faces in trying to 
sell a company can be identified. 
  The attempt to privatize Telecom [National Enterprise for 
Telecommunications] illustrates one such bottleneck: union 
pressures. As a solution, in France and England a system was 
used that has also been tried in Colombia: offering the workers 
shares of the company at a price below the market price. 
  Experts say Colombia has no serious privatization plan, so 
it 
is likely that mistakes may be made in the design and 
implementation of the process, and it may take a long time to 
become a reality. 
  Another fear is exchanging public monopolies for private 
monopolies. There is such a risk in Colombia, where few economic 
groups are able to buy big enterprises. One solution is for 
midsized investors to form associations with foreigners. That 
creates another problem: analysts say that attitudes in Colombia 
still foster a reluctance to use foreign capital. 
<H5>  Negotiators </H5>
  A major protagonist in a privatization process is the 
investment bankers group. These firms serve as liaisons and 
facilitators in the transfer of a state enterprise. The 
investment bank evaluates the company and determines the sales 
mechanism (auction or bidding, as well as other methods). 
  The most time-consuming part of their work is the 
negotiation 
process. 
  Reaching agreement between the parties is generally 
complicated by factors like union protests and criticisms from 
various factions that oppose the sale of state assets. 
  The bankers also have the job of appraising the company 
based 
on its financial position and the revenues it may generate in 
the future, in order to set a minimum price. 
  In every such process two groups of bankers are involved: 
those who present the sales package for the government and those 
whose client is the private investor. The purchaser's 
representative has to study acquisition alternatives and obtain 
financing. 
  This, among other things, explains why foreign investment 
banks have been hired for large privatization processes: the 
Colombian buyer needs foreign investment to purchase the 
enterprise. 
  In these cases, the bankers help to obtain investors, who 
insist that the firm be internationally known. 
  One method recently used a great deal in Colombia is an 
association between Colombian firms (which bring their knowledge 
of the country) and foreign firms, which have experience and a 
well-known name. 
  This is because Colombia's investment banks are still 
getting 
started.

  [Text] Medellin--The 1993 surprising decline in the urban 
unemployment rate to 7.8 percent has a fragile base, and here 
the results are not what they seem. 
  This is the opinion of private sector experts, who feel this 
situation cannot be sustained and that this apparent improvement 
is a double-edged sword. The situation is really disturbing, for 
the quality of jobs has deteriorated, underemployment has risen, 
and the decline in earnings is obvious. 
  The president of Andi [National Association of 
Industrialists], Carlos Arturo Angel, said the number of people 
out of work has apparently declined, but in reality, while 
informal employment throughout Latin America averages 31 
percent, in Colombia it provides 56 percent of the total number 
of jobs. Twenty percent are temporary jobs, and now the number 
of persons working for salaries below the minimum wage is very 
high. 
  In 1993 employment rates in the formal sector declined 1.2 
percent, and now the guerrillas are providing a labor pool. 
These remarks show that while euphoria is being generated by the 
latest unemployment figures, barely a glimpse of the tip of the 
iceberg of unemployment in Colombia can be seen. 
  Unemployment in industry seems to have declined, but not as 
the result of any official policy. This makes the nation's 
stability in the next few years precarious. 
  Jobs are being created in construction, services, and 
through 
increased government spending, but formal employment in 
industry, agriculture, and exports shows a steep decline. 
  Angel said that in an open economy a development model is 
needed that takes the jobs strategy into account; we need to 
choose between moving the economy toward more of a service-based 
economy, or a policy of real industrial development. 
  These remarks were made at the "Apertura" [Trade 
Liberalization] and Employment Forum held in Medellin, at which 
presidential candidate Ernesto Samper Pizano presented his 
proposals for generating 1.5 million productive jobs. 
  The goal is to achieve economic growth above 6 percent, 
which 
would allow the unemployment rate to be brought down to 5 
percent by the end of this century. 
  According to Angel, if Colombia does not grow and expand its 
industrial development, it will not be able to provide jobs for 
labor, and the "apertura" will just bring in more imports, 
leading to a real collapse of our exports. 
  In the opinion of the director of Fedesarrollo [Federation 
for Development], Eduardo Lora, the strategy the government has 
used to reduce unemployment is a double-edged sword, and the 
improved employment rates are the result of a macroeconomic 
policy that needs to be corrected, as it is detrimental to the 
possibility of developing better and long-term jobs. 
  In his view, basing this strategy on promoting government 
spending and construction is a mistake, as such a policy cannot 
be sustained on a macroeconomic and long-term level. 
  The rural problem was called the worst heritage this 
government is leaving behind, for the agricultural worker is 
worse off now than in 1950, as his real earnings have declined 
15 percent. 
  The dean of the School of Economics of the University of the 
Andes, Eduardo Sarmiento, suggested that the "apertura" policy 
in agriculture needs to be revamped. Agriculture today faces the 
most serious crisis of the past 20 years. Only livestock, milk, 
and soybeans have escaped this crisis, as these products are 
excluded from the "apertura." 
  He added that similar results are seen in industry, the 
result of the declining production of high value-added goods. 
Even though there has been a great expansion in construction, 
government services, and profit margins in the financial sector, 
it is unwise to sacrifice industry, agriculture, and exports for 
such gains. 
  On the issue of jobs, he noted that in the past two years 
not 
a single job has been created in industry and agriculture, but 
jobs have been found in construction, for cabdrivers, and for 
Dane [National Administrative Department of Statistics] 
bureaucrats. 
  Sarmiento called for a shift from the "apertura" policy of 
replacing limited and low wage jobs to a complementary policy in 
which jobs would be generated in modern sectors of the economy. 
  In general, the persons attending this forum representing a 
variety of views did reach consensus on a number of matters: the 
importance of centering economic and social policy on jobs, 
because despite the present drop in unemployment to 7.8 percent, 
it is by no means certain that this rate can be maintained, and 
the unemployment rate reveals barely the tip of the iceberg. The 
most serious problems are underemployment and unstable and 
low-wage jobs. 
  Other vital issues are the key role of the exchange rate and 
the need to avoid revaluation, which has thwarted the potential 
of the "apertura."

  [Text] The pendulum seems to be swinging back. In the 
United States, President Bill Clinton has replaced the radical 
free-market policy of his predecessors with a policy of 
intelligent state intervention. And in countries closer to 
Colombia, such as Mexico and Chile, where neoliberalism also 
held sway, the respective governments launched ambitious social 
programs several months ago to include a larger number of 
citizens in their liberalization processes. 
  Along the same lines--closer to Clinton than to Bush or 
Reagan--Liberal candidate Ernesto Samper announced the basic 
features of his economic and social program in October of last 
year. And just 10 days ago, acting on the conviction that "a 
social policy is above all an employment policy," and that state 
intervention is necessary in many areas, he turned his proposal 
into an ambitious employment plan that seeks to generate 1.5 
million new jobs in the next four years. 
  The plan is the fruit of many months of discussion within 
his 
campaign. Since the middle of last year, the Program Committee, 
coordinated by Guillermo Perry (other members include such 
experts on the subject as Antonio Urdinola, Luis Bernardo 
Florez, Cecilia Lopez, Marta Lucia Ramirez, and Antonio 
Hernandez), reached the conclusion that the centerpiece of the 
candidate's economic and social program should be jobs. And they 
set to work to make it a reality. 
  There were several reasons for choosing jobs, they said. 
First of all, more than 45 percent of Colombians live in 
poverty, and the only way to emerge from poverty is by getting a 
job. Second, the latest advancements in economic theory suggest 
that growth requires competitiveness, and this can be achieved 
only by generating productive employment. And third, the 
country's security problems--urban and rural--are closely 
related to the lack of job opportunities. 
<H5>  Sectoral Plans </H5>
  The plan's first component is growth itself. In other words, 
it is economic policy in general. "The employment plan," said 
Samper in Medellin the week before last, "will operate in the 
context of an economic policy that will facilitate the dynamic 
behavior of private investment and economic growth above six 
percent a year, without causing inflationary pressure." If these 
goals are accomplished, more than a million jobs could be 
created in the next four years. 
  The question is how to achieve these growth rates. And that 
is the first way in which Samper's proposal differs from 
policies currently in vogue. Although the candidate has repeated 
on several occasions that he will not reverse the liberalization 
and will maintain the principles of deregulation and efficiency 
that have guided the policy of the current administration--and 
in that sense his program would guarantee continuity--Samper 
believes that to accelerate growth it is necessary to return to 
sectoral policies, in which the state plays a critical role of 
supporting the private sector. 
  One of these policies has to do with the export sector. 
According to the plan, macroeconomic policy should be oriented 
toward preventing revaluation and guaranteeing exporters 
expanding markets. Specifically, Samper proposes the acquisition 
of marketing channels abroad, aggressive negotiating to open 
foreign markets, allocating more resources to Proexport, 
strengthening the Tax Rebate Certificate (Cert) program, and 
supporting industrial free-trade zones. That, according to the 
plan, will double minor exports in four years and generate more 
than 150,000 jobs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Another sectoral policy has to do with the 
agriculture-livestock sector. In this field, Samper promises to 
increase investment in land management and in the development 
and widespread use of improved varieties; to create price 
stabilization funds; to establish subsidies for the 
capitalization of the farm sector; to strengthen the Agrarian 
Savings Bank, the National Rehabilitation Plan (PNR), and the 
Integrated Rural Development Program (DRI); and to support the 
coffee-growers' committees and the coffee sector in general. The 
goal, in this case, is to achieve a growth rate of four percent 
per year, which could generate more than 120,000 jobs in the 
countryside. 
  The other policy is industrial modernization. Its aims are 
to 
establish a modernization fund for industrial restructuring, 
create sectoral and regional productivity centers, support 
business incubators, encourage subcontracting between large 
businesses and small and medium ones, and pursue a state 
procurement policy that favors Colombian goods and services. The 
objective is an industrial growth rate above 7.5 percent and 
approximately 150,000 new jobs in the sector. 
  In addition to the sectoral policies, however, the plan 
calls 
for three major investment programs that could generate 320,000 
more jobs: the infrastructure investment program, which seeks to 
bring the country up to date in terms of highways, 
communications, and power; the human capital investment program, 
which aims to boost the productivity of workers by improving 
their health and education; and the low-income housing program, 
which would extend the current subsidy system. 
<H5>  Growth Is Not Enough </H5>
  Samper and his advisers believe, however, that to overcome 
employment problems--and in particular the tremendous 
inequalities that exist among the different segments of the 
population--it is not enough to raise growth rates. After all, 
they say, at least a dozen industrialized countries have 
unemployment rates above 10 percent today. For this reason, the 
plan contains several specific jobs programs--and on this point 
as well it differs from the neoliberal credo--targeting 
microbusinesses, the vulnerable segments of the population, and 
training for employed workers. 
  The most ambitious program is the one for microbusinesses 
and 
small businesses, which seeks to generate 350,000 new jobs. Its 
objective is to facilitate microbusinesses' access to credit and 
technology by strengthening the Guarantee Fund in that sector, 
setting up a Finurbano (a kind of urban Finagro), supporting the 
foundations of microbusiness owners, expanding credit programs 
for professionals who establish productive businesses, and 
strengthening the channels for technical assistance and the 
spread of technology. 
  The training and recruitment programs for vulnerable groups 
are designed to establish special jobs programs, with the active 
participation of municipal and departmental governments, in the 
poorest parts of the country, targeting youths, women, jobless 
workers, and the handicapped. The idea is for the territorial 
entities that promote these programs to receive compensation 
from an Employment Solidarity Fund, which in turn would be 
funded by the national budget. 
  The goal, according to Samper, is for trade associations, 
the 
labor movement, professional associations, and the departmental 
and municipal governments to get involved in a great social pact 
to get the plan going. "An ambitious, but realistic plan," say 
his advisers.

  [Text] In a scene that looked like something out of a war 
movie, 60 members of the Aburra Valley Militia -- wearing hoods 
and carrying weapons -- traveled from Medellin to Ojevas, Sucre 
Department aboard government helicopters. The action is part of 
the process to reincorporate the Socialist Renewal Movement 
[CRS] into society. 
  At about noon today, the 60 men and women of the People's 
Militia of Aburra Valley were taken in two helicopters to the 
camp at Flor del Monte in Sucre where conversations are underway 
on the demobilization of the CRS. For the time being, these 
talks have not led to any significant agreement. 
  [Begin unidentified CRS member recording] The CRS is an 
organization that operates mainly in the cities. Throughout the 
nation it has 3,000 members, of which only 300 are in arms. That 
is the part we are going to negotiate with the national 
government. [end recording] 
  This is the third group of militias that has decided to go 
to 
negotiations in Medellin. Two other groups are conducting 
negotiations with the state in an area close to Medellin. The 
CRS, leader of these militias in the Aburra Valley, hopes that 
this example of urban disarmament will result in the release of 
200 men who are imprisoned before 3 April when the negotiations 
conclude.

do to them what David did to Goliath: wipe them out. [end

  These nine Granaderos are part of a group of 100 men who as 
of next week will be posted at strategic points. The police 
director announced other measures this morning for guaranteeing 
calm during the next elections. 
  [Begin Vargas Silva recording] All vacations, furloughs, and 
permits have been suspended so that as of yesterday and through 
13 March most of the police force will be on the streets, in 
those places we consider sensitive or vulnerable. [end recording]

passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] Today, the liberal and conservative parties 
reiterated their concern for the serious public order situation 
in the country. The government promised to defeat terrorism and 
propel the electoral process forward. 
  According to political leaders, there are serious public 
order difficulties in 17 of the country's 32 departments. 
  [Liberal Party leader Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala] "Evidently, 
peace has been broken and, thus, security has deteriorated." 
  The politicians also believe the recent intensification of 
violent guerrilla activities, including abductions and attacks, 
has restricted the candidates' freedom to move about in their 
regions. 
  [National Conservative Council President Cornelio Reyes] "We 
have received reports from several congressional candidates who 
have to campaign in helicopters because they cannot use the 
roads in their departments." 
  Confronted with such a situation, the government asserted it 
is necessary to challenge the terrorist threats. 
  [Government Minister Fabio Villegas] "Our goal is to have 
the 
direct presence of our Public Force in 100 percent of the 
municipal capital cities in the country during the electoral 
process." 
  Furthermore, the political parties charged that the actions 
carried out by the guerrillas have reached an intolerable level. 
  [Reyes] "There are areas, for example, the Aguachica 
municipality, where the guerrillas have not allowed traditional 
parties to open a political office." 
  [Turbay Ayala] "I don't deny there is violence. I, however, 
assert there will be elections." 
  The government affirms the 13 March elections are guaranteed 
by the presence of more than 100,000 Administrative Department 
of Security, police, and Army members.

  [Text] The National Liberation Army guerrillas are 
reportedly financing political campaigns in Casanare, according 
to Colonel Alfonso Plazas Vega. The former commander of the 
Cavalry Academy, which in 1987 assumed control of the Justice 
Palace during the bloody takeover by the 19 April Movement, said 
the guerrillas are holding contacts with candidates through 
third parties to finance their campaigns. 
  [Begin recording] [Plazas] I am talking about candidates for 
governor and candidates for mayor in the municipalities of 
Yopal, Tauramena, and Aguazul. 
  [Government Minister Fabio Villegas] I do not believe the 
guerrillas have that kind of power in the political campaigns in 
Casanare. I am not aware that they are trying to exert 
influence on the political development of the region. 
  [Former President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala] If that were the 
case, it must be condemned. [end recording] 
  According to Col. Plazas, the guerrillas are extorting 
businessmen by means of this system in Casanare. 
  [Begin Plazas recording] They are threatening candidates and 
asking them for allowances and if the allowances are not given 
they are included on a list of future kidnap victims in order to 
get the money anyway. [end recording] 
  Plazas Vega said that to solve the problem in Casanare, it 
is 
necessary to appoint military governors and mayors in that 
region of the country.

  [Text] Francisco Galan, Army of National Liberation, ELN, 
leader, was transferred to Itagui maximum security prison in the 
last few hours. A petition for protection recognized the 
guerrilla's right not to remain in solitary confinement. There 
was intense activity at Itagui prison since early today. The 
unexpected transfer of Galan and Juan Fernando Ospina Montoya, 
alias El Gordo, a Medellin cartel member, was carried out 
without a great fuss. 
  Galan was transferred from Santa Fe de Bogota aboard a 
National Police airplane after a judge ruled in his favor when a 
petition was filed requesting he be removed from the military 
garrison where he was being held and sent to a prison. 
  Ospina Montoya was flown from Medellin to the capital aboard 
the same plane. He is to testify before a faceless judge, who is 
in charge of his case, in the next few hours. Ospina Montoya 
surrendered to justice on 4 July 1991 together with La Garra, El 
Angelito, and Icopur. He was one of the few who was unable to 
escape Envigado prison.

  [Text] Reacting to the guerrilla offensive in the country's 
eastern area, military forces reinforced their units, mainly in 
Arauca where over 12 rebels were killed. Here is Marta Rojas 
with her report. 
  [Begin recording] [Rojas] Today, Tuesday, the largest 
military operation against guerrillas taking place in Arauca 
Department was stepped up. The operation, with the support of 
the Army Special Forces Command, seeks, among other things, to 
curb the political power of the guerrilla groups. 
  [Fourth Division Commander General Carlos Gil, identified by 
caption] According to the intelligence we had, the rebels 
planned to take over Fortul and Tame, as a preamble to the 
elections the country is preparing for. 
  [Rojas] The offensive covers the towns of Tame, Fortul, 
Saravena, and Arauquita. Four dead soldiers and 14 wounded were 
evacuated from the zone. The troops are trying to confirm the 
existence of a mass grave in La Paz area, where at least 10 
guerrillas were reportedly buried. According to intelligence 
information from the Administrative Department of Security, 22 
guerrillas were wounded, 11 of whom were reportedly killed, in 
the penultimate clash in Fortul. 
  [Gil] We are saying those who were wounded must receive 
medical care, within the framework of humanitarian international 
law, provided the care is administered under military control. 
  [Rojas] The army controls the roads now. Intense air 
operations, including the mobilization of over 100 OV-10 
helicopters and an Army Special Forces command unit, seek to 
counter the actions of four Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia fronts active in Arauca. [end recording]

Representatives, three mayors, and one councilman, while in 
separate attacks they killed an ADM-19 [19 April Movement 
Democratic Alliance] political leader, ambushed a military 
patrol, and set fire to three buses. 
  The new acts of violence took place in Fortul, Arauca 
Department, where five soldiers were killed, and in La Guajira, 
where the rebels burned two tractors and one bus. The body of 
Laureano Restrepo Rodriguez, a former councilman and ADM-19 
debate chief, was found in a rural area of Yumbo, Valle

Jorge Carmelo Perez Alvarado, candidates to the House of 
Representatives, and Alejandria Mayor Jaime Alonso Cano, Sumapaz 
Mayor Guillermo Leal, Santo Domingo Mayor Davisnel Delgado, and 
Santo Domingo Council Chief John Jairo Duque. The Simon Bolivar

  [Text] The annual UN report on world drug trafficking, 
according to which the outlook is pretty discouraging, was 
unveiled today. For UN members, the war against drug 
trafficking has not even begun. The report by the UN 
International Control Board concludes drug cartels are 
increasing their economic power and political influence. It 
noted drug traffickers are increasingly violent and ruthless in 
their attempt to control the drug-trafficking network. 
Regarding Colombia, the report states drug traffickers have 
always tried to exert influence on the legislative branch and 
government. During presentation of the document, Prosecutor 
General de Greiff said the antidrug war has been a failure. 
  [Begin recording] [De Greiff] Here in Colombia, Mr. Gonzalo 
Rodriguez Gacha has died at the hands of authorities. Mr. Pablo 
Escobar has died. Mr. Carlos Lehder was extradited. We have in 
jail a large number of drug traffickers, and what has happened 
in the market? Absolutely nothing. 
  [Arturo Heinz, UN director in Colombia, identified by 
caption] As Colombia stated at the appropriate time, there has 
to be an overall approach between the narcotics demand and 
supply. This is a complex problem; it is not a unilateral 
problem in which the culprits are the consumers or producers. 
[end recording] 
  The prosecutor general stated whereas in Colombia the policy 
is to open the door to drug traffickers who want to surrender to 
justice, the United States prefers to withhold evidence, hoping 
the Colombian drug traffickers will turn up in other countries.

  [Text] The International Drugs Control Board [Junta 
Internacional de Fiscalizacion de Drogas] has charged drug 
traffickers are continuously infiltrating the Colombian 
Government and Congress. 
  The board has information about visits attorneys of the Cali 
Cartel have made to Congress during discussions of the Penal 
Procedures Code and about acts of intimidation by other cartels 
when the Geneva Convention on drug trafficking was being 
discussed. 
  [Begin Rene Saa Vidal, Drugs Control Board spokesman, 
recording] One main concern was the fact Congress did not 
approve the Viena Convention, which had been presented for 
approval in 1992, due to pressure exerted on the extradition 
issue, especially. 
  The investigations that Congress made years ago, as well as 
recently, about how certain congressmen are directly involved 
with drug traffickers have led the board to affirm there is a 
continuous concern over the fact that drug traffickers are 
trying to exert influence in parliament. [end recording] 
  The board has also denounced the vast corruptive clout drug 
traffickers have in countries where there are drug-trafficking 
activities. Concerning Colombia, the board has found evidence 
that certain cartel men have infiltrated the Attorney General's 
Office. 
  The board has also stated in Colombia little or nothing has 
been done to combat drug trafficking.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 1 Mar (EFE) -- Mines and Energy 
Minister Guido Nule Amin said today Colombia does not expect 
"reprisals" from Cuban exiles or the United States for the 
announced sale of oil to Cuba. 
  The official, who announced last week the sale of between 
15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil to Cuba per day, said the oil 
exports will begin in mid-1994. 
  "Cuba's main partners are Mexico and Canada, and it has been 
no cause for problems with the United States," Nule Amin added. 
  The energy and mines minister said he does not see how 
Colombia "could have problems" for selling crude to the island. 
  He explained Colombia will sell that quantity of oil, 
"barely 
one third of the (Cuban) demand for oil." 
  He said the method of payment of these "direct" sales will 
be 
"at international prices, and the Cubans will pay with foreign 
exchange." 
  Meanwhile, it was reported in Santa Fe de Bogota Cuban 
exiles 
in Miami would allegedly boycott Colombian products.

to Japan today. Early this morning he met with leading financial 
officials to attract Far East investors to our country. 
  President Gaviria's agenda for the first day of his official 
visit to Japan was tight and very productive. During a meeting 
with the Japanese financial sector, the Colombian president and 
the members of his cabinet emphasized economic and security 
advances achieved by the country in past years. They tried to 
convince Japanese investors of the benefits offered by Colombia 
in the business sector. 
  On another topic, Gaviria asked Japan to reduce its tariff 
barriers and to reconsider its restrictions to the import of 
Colombian flowers. Japanese Government officials and media have 
viewed the Colombian president's visit favorably and expect it 
will yield positive results for both countries.

  [Text] Live, from the Civil Defense command post in Plaza 
[de la Revolucion] Municipality, we received news of the tour 
made last night by President Fidel Castro, which lasted into the 
wee hours of this morning, as well as about the news conference 
held there. From Edelberto Garcia, at the command post, we have 
a report: 
  [Garcia] Good morning, "First Thing in the Morning" 
listeners. 
  In the wee hours this morning, Commander in Chief Fidel 
Castro visited the command post of the Defense Council of Plaza 
de la Revolucion Municipality, which was activated yesterday in 
view of possible imminent storm surges along this part of the 
Havana coastline. So far, however, there have been only slight 
surges. 
  Fidel arrived at this coordinating point for the 
municipality 
-- which is located at the headquarters of the Communist Party 
of Cuba [PCC] -- at 0220 and quickly asked how penetration by 
the sea might affect the area. This is the second threat of 
storm surges so far this year. 
  (Eduardo Tejera), PCC first secretary in Plaza de la 
Revolucion Municipality, briefed the leader of the Revolution on 
the measures that have been taken, which include the moving of 
all foodstuffs from gastronomic and commercial centers, the 
cleaning of storm drains, and the evacuation of 50 percent of 
the tourists lodged at the Habana Riviera Hotel. 
  Fidel explained that he had visited the Riviera [Hotel] area 
and had been able to see the measures that had been taken, as 
well as the retaining wall built recently in front of the hotel 
to reduce the effect of the waves. In this connection, he 
explained the importance of providing protective mechanisms for 
any new hotels that may be built in these areas because 
everything seems to indicate that, as a result of several 
phenomena, these surges will tend to increase. 
  Fidel pointed out: We have already had two threats this 
year; 
and this one is still not over, because there will be another 
high tide at noon today and with it returns the threat of 
possible flooding in low-lying areas of five municipalities in 
this capital. 
  The commander in chief had a long and pleasant talk with 
reporters until after 0330. Fidel insisted -- and I wish to 
stress this to our listeners -- on his concern that the 
population remain attentive to the reports issued by the weather 
institute in the next few hours. By the way, there will be a 
meeting at approximately 0700 today at the headquarters of this 
city's provincial government to take specific measures in this 
connection. 
  This has been Edelberto Garcia, reporting from the command 
post of the Defense Council of Plaza de la Revolucion 
Municipality for "First Thing in the Morning."

  [Text] Havana, 2 Mar (EFE) -- Cuban Finance Minister Jose 
Luis Rodriguez said today people should not talk about economic 
recovery yet, rather, that it is a year during which we will 
change our economic mentality, because "we have gone from an 
economic certitude to the management of uncertainty." 
  At a conference for Higher Education Ministry officials, 
Rodriguez said Cuba has an ample level of certitude on imports, 
exports, and other resources, in addition to its economic 
planning system. He estimated that the changes introduced in 
the Cuban economy can be slow according to the people's needs 
but not according to the possibilities of the island. 
  Among the economic measures implemented since last August, 
Rodriguez mentioned the depenalization of the dollar, the 
opening to foreign investments, and the increase of tasks 
authorized for self-employment. 
  The Cuban finance minister said 1994 will be better than 
1993 
for Cuba from the economic standpoint, "as it will break the 
violent economic fall suffered from 1989 to 1993." 
  He based his assertion on the possibilities of having a 
cheaper sugarcane harvest, the recovery of sugar and nickel 
prices--two of the country's main economic sectors--and getting 
tourism to grow 25 percent. 
  Other factors that will mark this year in the Cuba economy, 
according to the specialist, will be the substitution of 
imports, the discovery of new oil deposits, the recovery of 
fuel, and an increase -- although not an extraordinary one -- in 
agricultural production.

  [Text] Colombian President Cesar Gaviria has stated in 
Tokyo that the sale of Colombian oil to Cuba is rooted in 
strictly commercial grounds. Gaviria pointed out that Colombia 
feels entirely free to continue trading with Cuba and will in 
fact do so, since such is the treatment any country in the world 
deserves. 
  Colombia announced last week that it will begin selling 
between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba as of 
mid-1994.

  [Text] In Geneva, Cuba distributed a secret document 
dictated by the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. The report 
shows the dishonesty of the allegations made by the so-called 
human rights organizations on the island. Signed by Joseph 
Gerald Sullivan, the head of the U.S. Interests Section, the 
report points out that in the cases presented by the heads of 
those groups, the subjects are incapable of proving that they 
have been or are victims of persecution or violations. 
  The text was addressed to the State Department, the Central 
Intelligence Agency, and the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, and was circulated in Geneva while Cuban Ambassador 
Jose Perez Novoa responded to the report presented by (Carl 
Johann Gros), the special rapporteur of the UN Human Rights 
Commission assigned to Cuba. 
  The official text of the U.S. mission recognizes that the 
number of political prisoners is very small and that once they 
are freed, they are not persecuted, discriminated against, or 
mistreated. Most of them request visas at the U.S. Interests 
Section to escape Cuba's economic situation, not out of fear. 
Furthermore, the document points out that many of the members of 
those groups take that path as the most opportune way to 
emigrate toward the United States with that country's official 
backing. 
  The document, signed by the head of the U.S. Interests 
Section, describes the differences between groups and the need 
to work harder to identify those who, as demonstrated by their 
nature, would be most useful in serving the objectives of the 
United States.

  [Text] Havana, 2 Mar (EFE) -- A spokesperson for the Cuban 
dissident movement reported today Sebastian Arcos, a human 
rights activist, was "brutally beaten." The incident occurred 
last 28 February by a group of common criminals serving time at 
Cienfuegos Prison, where Arcos is being held. 
  Jesus Yanez Pelletier said the attack occurred when the 
group 
of criminals tried to take a package of food Arcos had tied to 
his arm while he slept. "Sebastian awoke," he said, "and they 
beat him." 
  According to Yanez Pelletier, the authorities have kept 
Arcos 
in solitary confinement since the incident. His relatives in 
Cienfuegos have been unable to see him. 
  The spokesperson, a member of the Cuban Human Rights 
Committee [CCPDH], said he was advised of the incident from a 
source inside the penitentiary. Sebastian Arcos is a vice 
president of the CCPDH, and his brother, Gustavo, is president. 
  Yanez Pelletier held "the government" responsible for the 
attack, and reported it to the Spanish Embassy in Havana. 
Diplomatic sources have confirmed receiving the report. 
  Sebastian Arcos, 63, was sentenced to four years and eight 
months in prison in 1992 for the crime of "enemy propaganda 
activities." He was accused of dispersing false reports about 
alleged murders, disappearances, and torture. 
  The two brothers, Sebastian and Gustavo, each served a 
two-year sentence during the Fulgencio Batista dictatorship. 
They were again imprisoned for "trying to leave the country 
illegally" in 1981. 
  Spanish authorities have repeatedly requested Sebastian 
Arcos' release. Cuba will only allow his freedom if he goes 
straight from prison to the airport and then on to Madrid. 
  According to sources within the group, Arcos refuses to 
leave 
the country.

<F P=106> [From the "Morning Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Alpha 66, the Miami-based counterrevolutionary 
group, has threatened to carry out terrorist actions against the 
group Pastors for Peace, which has organized the Cuba-U.S. 
Friendship Caravan, if the group continues to travel through 
U.S. cities. 
  In a letter sent to that ecumenical organization, the 
terrorists say any person who visits Cuba, holds talks, or 
supports its authorities directly or indirectly will be declared 
a military target, regardless of his nationality or nature [as 
heard] and will suffer the consequences inside or outside of 
Cuba. 
  Referring to the warnings by the U.S. Government to those 
individuals or groups preparing terrorist actions against third 
countries from within U.S. territories, Alpha 66's letter adds 
it will stop at nothing and will confront the consequences. 
  Meanwhile, the coordinators of the Friendship Caravan have 
reported the caravan of 70 vehicles traveling through 140 U.S. 
cities continues to advance satisfactorily. During the travels 
group leaders give lectures, visit churches, and collect 
donations. According to plans, the volunteers will reach Laredo, 
Texas, on 6 March, and three days later they will cross the 
border into Mexico; they will then take the goods to a ship that 
will sail to Cuba from the Port of Tampico.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] During a Parliament in the Workplace held at the 
industrial area of the Efrain Alfonso Agroindustrial Complex 
[CAI] in Ranchuelo Municipality, Villa Clara Province, the 
workers came out in favor of stable and high grinding, a 
decisive factor for economic efficiency. The event was chaired 
by Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban Workers 
Federation. It was reported that one of the factors affecting 
efficiency is the high rate, 37 percent, of foreign matter in 
the cane supplied by the Osvaldo Herrera facility. The cane 
sometimes has rocks, chaff, and sprouts in it, which interfere 
with a good grinding rate when the process has to be stopped to 
eliminate them. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] Analyzing the 
economic 
problems at our factory, as the comrades rightly said: This is a 
serious one -- because, aside from stable grinding, in order for 
a mill to be efficient and seek to economize, the other thing 
that must be kept in mind is the quality of the raw material. We 
cannot make sugar without quality raw material, cannot make it 
of good quality, and that (?affects) efficiency. 
  This is the problem of the quality of the raw material that 
has been confronted here in Cuba for years -- more so in some 
years than in others. This year, at this mill, that has been 
significant, because the truth is that the raw material has come 
from that collection center in very poor condition in terms of 
the amount of foreign materials. 
  It is true that the management here and the union and the 
party have met many times. They have held municipal meetings, 
provincial level meetings, and every possible meeting. 
  Now, (?what should we do)? If we want to repair the economy 
and be economical and move ahead, after you discuss the same 
problem twice with the same comrades, you need to take measures: 
Hello, comrade, I am not going to discuss this with you today; 
that amount of foreign matter must be reduced. I will come back 
tomorrow to discuss it. Perhaps they may discuss it a third 
time, but the fourth time we have to take urgent measures: Well, 
buddy, I am sending the cane back. I am returning it. Clean it 
up and when you bring it here clean, I will grind it. Why? 
Because then, we begin to argue that the (?raw material) is bad 
but no measures are taken. Thus, those comrades believe that 
things will always go that way, that people will just talk, and 
then this is what happens. 
  I think that in order to be efficient, aside from any 
discussions there may be, concrete measures must be taken with 
the comrades who are committing the violations; otherwise they 
become habitual. A time comes when they get used to the [word 
indistinct], to hearing us, or whatever comrades go there, say 
to them: That is not right. However, since they know things are 
not going to go any further, they know that...[rephrases] 
perhaps they have become accustomed to the idea that no measures 
are going to be taken, so they continue doing it and we continue 
receiving it. We reach a point where, by having accepted it from 
them, and by [word indistinct] we are committing the same 
mistake, the same sin against the economy. [end recording] 
  At the workers assembly held at the Efrain Alfonso CAI, 
Pedro 
Ross Leal expressed interest in the situation at the complex as 
regards outstanding accounts from other organizations; he 
explained the significance of not complying with this indicator, 
and its significance to the national economy. The workers also 
advocated the expeditious arrival of cane to the mill, which at 
times takes over 36 hours. This reduces its quality and results 
in less sugar. 
  Strong statements were made about the causes, consequences, 
and possible measures to be taken to solve the national 
financial imbalance. Debate focused on the all-out war against 
the black market, the lack of control, and the pilfering of 
resources from state organizations. 
  Likewise, the workers supported the confiscation of goods 
attained illegally, and deregulating and increasing prices of 
nonessential products, among other issues which will help to 
streamline national finances.

<F P=106> [Report by Eduardo Gonzalez] </F>
  [Text] [Gonzalez] Greetings. I just heard a great phrase: 
[When it comes] to research, information is more important than 
labs. It is impossible to do research, no matter how many labs, 
without information. 
  We are going to speak about information with engineer Carlos 
Guerrero from the Biotechnology and Medical-Pharmaceutical 
Industry Information and Consultation Center [Centro de 
Informacion and Consultoria para la Biotecnologia y la Industria 
Medico-farmaceutica], popularly known as Biotech. 
  [Guerrero] Biotech's goal is to provide logistic support to 
every center and institution in the western scientific hub. The 
support takes two main forms. The first is the preparation of 
directories. For example, we created the Biotech International 
Directory which has over 7,000 entries and includes 120 
countries -- it lists the most important companies in this 
sector in the world. It is available in printed form and on 
compact disk, CD-ROM. It is undoubtedly one of the best 
directories in the world on this subject. We also have other 
directories such as the one on Cuban biological sciences, which 
lists all the institutions working in biotechnology and the 
medical-pharmaceutical industry in Cuba. 
  Another important Biotech line of work is analysis reports. 
We prepare market reports, company profiles, product 
performance, studies on issues such as cancer, optic diseases, 
or others requested by our customers. We have another very 
important product: The Biotech Guide for Export to Cuba. It 
includes all the customs and noncustoms regulations, as well as 
technical regulations for exporting biotechnology and medical 
and pharmaceutical products to Cuba. 
  The information services Biotech provides to researchers are 
also important. We have over 50 data bases available to 
researchers. These include commercial and specialized 
information for consultation at our libraries and center. 
  [Gonzalez] Are these Biotech services also available to 
foreign companies or enterprises? 
  [Guerrero] Of course. It is not that we put our services on 
the market, but that we have important customers abroad who use 
our services.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 3 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Today, authorities 
reported that university students threw rocks at police during a 
demonstration against academic reforms, and as a result, seven 
youths were injured. The police reported that during the 
demonstration some 2,000 students of the Autonomous University 
of Santo Domingo detonated homemade bombs, destroyed several 
vehicles, and threw rocks at security units. 
  University Rector Roberto Santana said the students oppose 
reforms established by university statutes because "they resist 
change and continue to live in the past." For the past two 
years, the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo has been among 
the centers showing the strongest opposition to the regime of 
President Joaquin Balaguer. This has caused frequent 
confrontations between students and the police.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 2 March, Haitian deputies passed 
a resolution approving a U.S.- and UN-backed plan for settling 
the Haitian crisis, a plan supported by the United States and 
the United Nations. The compromise plan -- which provides for 
the early retirement of General Raoul Cedras, head of the Army, 
before the new prime minister takes office and which does not 
set a date for exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's return 
-- was approved without difficulty, by a vote of 35 out of 45. 
  Several deputies affiliated to the National Front for Change 
and Democracy, FNCD -- which backs President Aristide -- voted 
in favor of this plan. A number of FNCD parliamentarians, 
however, preferred to absent themselves from the discussions and 
the vote. 
  This plan presented by Haitian parliamentarians representing 
the main political tendencies in the Port-au-Prince parliament 
was backed by the United States and UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. 
  The 11-point plan approved by the deputies provides for, 
among other things: President Aristide's choosing and appointing 
a new prime minister in compliance with the Constitution; the 
passing of the amnesty law by the parliament's two chambers; the 
signing and promulgation of the amnesty law by President 
Aristide; the early retirement of General Cedras, a retirement 
already accepted by the head of state; the appointing of a new 
head of the Army by the head of state, in conformity with the 
Constitution; the ratification of the new prime minister by the 
Chamber of Deputies and of the new head of the Army chief by the 
Senate [as heard]; a vote of confidence for the new prime 
minister's statement of general policy from the two legislative 
chambers; and the suspension of all international sanctions 
imposed by the UN and the OAS. 
  The plan provides for Gen. Cedras to step down as head of 
the 
Army before the new government is appointed, while obtaining his 
main guarantee, which is the amnesty law. For his part, 
President Aristide obtains Gen. Cedras' early retirement before 
the establishment of the new government. 
  The vote on the law creating the new police force will take 
place after a new government takes office because -- say the 
deputies -- in keeping with the Constitution, only the executive 
can define such a law.

  [Text] CONACOM, the National Congress of Democratic 
Movements, is backing the resolution voted on 2 March in the 
Chamber of Deputies. The party said so in a news conference 
today. Rothschild [Francois] filed a report: 
  [Francois] Good Morning. CONACOM is on the same wavelength 
as 
the Haitian deputies. Victor Benoit's party has just brought its 
unconditional support to a plan for settlement of the crisis, 
voted as a resolution on March 2 by the deputies. In a meeting 
with the press today, CONACOM asserted that it welcomes the 
legislators' initiative. CONACOM, which participated in the 
discussions in Washington that resulted in the elaboration of 
this plan, believes this document represents a compromise 
between the two antagonistic sectors, President Aristide and 
General Cedras. CONACOM also believes that the legislators' 
resolution takes into account the demands of both sectors in the 
Haitian crisis. According to Victor Benoit's party, this 
resolution represents a step in the right direction, toward the 
Governors Island accord. 
  [Begin Benoit recording, in Creole] CONACOM strongly 
supports 
the legislators' proposal and the resolution of the Chamber of 
Deputies for the following reasons: 
  A. It is a good proposal, in compliance with the country's 
Constitution, the Governors Island accord, the New York pact, 
and the Miami conference. 
  B. It is a good proposal, written in a spirit of compromise. 
It respects President Aristide's demands -- his return to power 
in Haiti and Gen. [Cedras'] anticipated retirement. This 
proposal also respects the general's demands: amnesty for the 
Army and for many people within society. It respects the demands 
of the entire political sector: the formation of a government of 
national concord, sociopolitical appeasement following national 
reconciliation. This proposal also respects what all the classes 
in the country are demanding: the lifting of the embargo so the 
people can operate under good conditions. [end recording] 
  [Francois] Questioned on President Aristide's position -- 
who 
has already rejected this plan presented by the legislators -- 
the CONACOM leaders indicate that they do not seek confrontation 
with the president-in-exile. According to Micha Gaillard, one of 
the members of CONACOM leadership, the party intends to continue 
talking with President Aristide on that question. 
  Regarding the post of prime minister, the CONACOM secretary 
general denied that the trip to Washington was to negotiate such 
a position. In any case, Victor Benoit points out that if 
President Aristide asks him to govern the next government, he 
will be ready to accept such a proposal. 
  Rothschild Francois, Jr., from CONACOM headquarters, for 
Radio Metropole.

several weeks in Washington. They arrived at the Mais Gate 
Airport at about 1800 GMT. Sen. Larosiliere says he wishes to 
continue his work to unblock the country's current crisis and 
says he will return to his office in parliament after resting up 
from his stay in the United States. He says he wants to work for 
the reconciliation of all of Haiti's sons. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [unidentified reporter] Sen. 
Larosiliere, you know your name has been mentioned as a possible 
Haitian prime minister. Are you still willing to accept this 
post? 
  [Larosiliere] Listen, brother, I tell you well: I am always 
ready to go exactly where my duty calls me, but this is not what 
I went to settle in the United States. I went there to find a 
way to get my country out of the present situation. Sen. 
Larosiliere will work so that whoever is chosen as prime 
minister can be ratified and succeed, provided he can do the 
job. Being prime minister is not Sen. Larosiliere's main 
objective. Not at all. I have three more years to spend as a 
senator of the Republic. But as I told you, I will always be 
wherever my duty requires me to be. [passage omitted] [end

  [Text] The Senate of the Republic is considering 
disciplinary measures against absentee senators. The office led 
by Senator Bernard Sansaricq is getting ready to vote on a 
resolution regarding disciplinary measures aimed at the absent 
senators. The resolution's preamble refers to articles of the 
Constitution and the Senate's internal rules on penalizing 
legislators who persist in skipping sessions for the purpose of 
sabotaging the legislative power. 
  The first article of this resolution provides for suspension 
with four months' loss of pay for senators whose behavior is 
determined incomprehensible and irresponsible. The resolution 
goes farther in its second article, providing for a commission 
to investigate possible participation by the senators in 
reinforcing the embargo and other sanctions against Haiti. 
  It should be noted that no voting has yet occurred on this 
resolution, which is circulating in the Senate of the Republic.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Indian Revolutionary Clandestine </F>
Committee-General Command of the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army in southeastern Mexico on 1 March] 
  [Text] Communique by the Indian Revolutionary Clandestine 
Committee-General Command of the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army [EZLN], 1 March 1994. 
  To the people of Mexico, the peoples and governments of the 
world, the national and international press, and our brothers: 
  The Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee-General 
Command of the EZLN addresses you all respectfully and honorably 
to make a statement. 
  First: The EZLN came to this bargaining table with the real 
intention of stating its views and explaining all the reasons 
that forced us to take up arms in order to avoid dying 
dishonorably. We came here to hold a dialogue, that is we came 
to talk and listen. We spoke to the supreme government and all 
the good and honest people in the world. We also spoke to the 
bad people so they will listen to the truth. Some heard our 
word; others followed the path of despise against our voice and 
our race. 
  Second: We met heedful ears ready to listen to the truth 
coming from our lips. The San Cristobal dialogue was truthful. 
There were no ill intentions or lies, nothing was concealed 
from our hearts and the people of reason and kindness. There 
was no sale or purchase of dignities. There was equality when 
speaking and listening. There was a good and truthful dialogue. 
  Third: We now have answers that reflect the real interest of 
the peace commissioner to find peace. We now have the 
obligation to reflect on what his words say. We must now speak 
to the collective heart that commands us. We must listen to its 
voice to be able to walk again. From it, from our people, from 
the Indians in the mountains and the creeks will come the next 
signal to take the following step on this path, whose goal will 
be peace with justice and dignity or it will not be. 
  Fourth: We have found in the commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas a man who is willing to listen to our 
reasonings and demands. Not only did he listen to us and 
understand our position, but he also sought possible solutions 
to our problems. We salute the attitude assumed by Peace 
Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis. 
  Fifth: We have seen in Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, the 
national mediation commissioner, a real and permanent interest 
in eliminating all the obstacles that could get in the way of 
peace. Along with him, good men and women worked day and night 
to make sure nothing interrupted the dialogue. Sacrificing 
their personal safety, well-being, and health, the mediators 
fulfilled their mission by negotiating not between peace or war 
but between two voices that are still trying to reach a peace 
agreement. These men and women received us because they want 
peace. If peace is achieved in this region, it will be thanks 
first of all to their peace efforts. We recognize the sacrifice 
and dedication of the National Mediation Commission, 
particularly that of Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia. 
  Sixth: This phase of the dialogue is over now, and we are on 
the right path. Let us eliminate all obstacles and continue 
moving forward. 
  Freedom! 
  Justice! 
  Democracy! 
  Respectfully, 
  [Signed ] Subcommander Marcos 
  [Issued] From southeastern Mexico by the Indian 
Revolutionary Clandestine Committee-General Command of the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army -- Mexico, March 1994.

  [Text] Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis bid the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army, EZLN, delegates, especially 
Subcommander Marcos, goodbye in Ocosingo, Chiapas very early 
this morning. Camacho Solis reiterated his conformation with the 
commitments reached in the Zapatists' presence. The first phase 
of the peace and reconciliation talks in Chiapas resulted in 34 
commitments. We will later describe the commitments reached, as 
well as the EZLN demands and Commissioner Manuel Camacho's 
responses during almost 10 days of this first phase. 
  Peace has not been signed in Chiapas. The Zapatists are 
returning to their communities to report on the agreements 
reached. The commissioner, the Zapatists, and mediator Samuel 
Ruiz will meet again, probably by the end of this month, 
although the date has still not been set. After Camacho Solis 
departed, the EZLN delegates, accompanied by International Red 
Cross representatives, returned to their communities to explain 
the agreements. I repeat, they will return to San Cristobal de 
las Casa before the month is over.

<F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] At the conclusion of the first stage of talks in 
Chiapas, the government responds with firm commitments to the 
demands of the Indians, who are represented by the EZLN 
[Zapatist National Liberation Army], while the government also 
responds to the nation's demands. Such is democracy. 
  Ten days have passed since the negotiating table was 
established in San Cristobal de las Casas; of the 34 points 
presented, two are not resolved. The commitment of greatest 
transcendency is the summons of special Congressional sessions 
for electoral reforms that will bestow trustworthiness on the 21 
August elections. Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis said 
democratic policy is the road to change and on this point he 
made reference to guarantees for the nation's progress. Here is 
what Manuel Camacho Solis said: 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] Of the 34 initial points on 
the list of petitions, the two referring to national democracy 
are not part of the negotiation; however a response has been 
clearly given for these. Instead of taking the confrontation 
down a dead end street, we will all be part of a process of 
political and institutional changes. This process must take 
place in the civil society's institutions, in political parties, 
in the state branches, and in public opinion. Democratic policy 
is the road to change. The announcement that there will be 
special sessions in the Congress -- with the political parties' 
agreement -- to make reforms that will guarantee the 
impartiality of the electoral institutions and the communities' 
participation, is an important step toward democratic change. 
This will contribute to the construction of peace in Chiapas. 
[end recording] 
  This morning at the San Cristobal de las Casas cathedral, in 
front of the media and the EZLN delegates, Camacho Solis said 
that the results of the peace negotiations are unique and are a 
source of pride for Mexico. Camacho Solis said that the road to 
justice has been traced without winners or losers, as the 
patriotism of the participants involved prevailed without 
adversely affecting the legitimate rights of third parties. 
Camacho Solis acknowledged that there were limitations in the 
dialogue, noting, however, that neither constitutional order nor 
sovereignty were ever hampered. 
  In the document entitled Commitment for a Worthy Peace, the 
EZLN was offered the choice of the type or nature of its social 
participation. Deadlines from 60 to 90 days were fixed to 
initiate programs and resolutions on the demands of extension 
for electricity projects, rehabilitation of hospitals and health 
clinics, emergency programs to combat malnutrition problems, 
support for womens community organizations, and support for the 
transportation sector, as well as the concession or purchase of 
a radio station controlled by the Indians. 
  With regard to the land problem, it was acknowledged that 
the 
agrarian reform process was not fully carried out in Chiapas. 
As a result, an initiative was presented on a general law on 
the Indian communities' rights, in response to the demands of 
government autonomy, as well as on economic, political, and 
cultural demands. Article 4 and parts of Article 27, which 
strengthen the State's powers for the restitution of lands and 
the division of vast land estates, will also be reformed. Also, 
in response to the EZLN's list of petitions, the creation of the 
Prosecutors Office for the Defense of Indians' Rights is 
highlighted. 
  In addition, the Treasury Secretariat, within 60 days will 
respond to expired loans, while the eviction of Indians will be 
considered a crime. The Trade Secretariat will analyze NAFTA's 
impact on Indian communities while a new electoral law will be 
enacted in Chiapas. With regard to the EZLN demands to stage a 
political trial against former governors Patrocinio Gonzalez, 
Absalon Castellanos, and Elmar Zetzer, it was said that the 
spirit of peace should wipe out resentments. 
  It was indicated that the release of political prisoners 
would be carried out once peace is signed and in keeping with 
the amnesty law. In addition, it is guaranteed that aid to the 
victims of the conflict will be channeled through community 
representatives. 
  Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis indicated that the 
Federal Government's response includes all the Chiapas sectors 
although they have broader repercussions. Camacho Solis said 
that after consultations held by both of the dialogue 
participants on these proposals, the final peace agreement in 
Chiapas will be signed by the attorney general, the secretary 
general of Amnesty and Reconciliation for Chiapas, the secretary 
general of the Government, and the prosecutor. Meanwhile, for 
the EZLN, general staff representatives will be appointed. 
  The consultations with the Indian communities and at 
government institutions' levels could be concluded before the 
end of this month. Meanwhile, the EZLN acknowledged that the 
response to their demands put on the San Cristobal negotiating 
table reflects true interest in finding peace. At the 
conclusion of this first phase of the peace and reconciliation 
efforts in Chiapas, EZLN delegates read communiques in which 
they set out their position on the negotiations. An EZLN 
representative -- who on this occasion was not Subcommander 
Marcos -- acknowledged that a true dialogue had taken place 
without deceit or lies, without the purchase or sale of dignity. 
Here is what an unidentified EZLN representative said: 
  [Being EZLN representative recording] We found willingness 
and eagerness to hear the truth which we spoke. The San 
Cristobal dialogue was a true dialogue, there was no deceit or 
lies, nothing was hidden in our hearts [words indistinct] reason 
and goodness. There was no sale or purchase of dignity; we spoke 
and were heard on an equal level. It was a true and good 
dialogue. [end recording] 
  The EZLN widely acknowledged its appreciation of Manuel 
Camacho Solis of whom it was said did not limit himself to just 
hearing and understanding them, rather he searched for 
alternative solutions. The EZLN also acknowledged its 
appreciation of Bishop Samuel Ruiz' true concern to overcome the 
obstacles found on the road to peace. The EZLN said that the 
mediators fulfilled their tasks not in the middle of peace and 
war, but as two voices that are still trying to find each other. 
The EZLN indicated that now it must speak to the collective 
heart of the Indians who are in the mountains. The armed group 
also thanked the honest and altruistic work of the 
nongovernmental organizations the representatives of which 
formed a peace cordon around the San Cristobal cathedral where 
this first stage of the dialogue for peace and reconciliation 
took place. 
  This morning Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las 
Cases, also gave his views on the conclusion of the dialogue's 
first stage. Ruiz said that the conclusion of this first stage 
of the efforts for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas 
represents a landmark in Mexican history in which the Indians 
demand and proclaim everyone's participation. Moreover, Ruiz 
indicated that hidden forces representing state control and the 
return to former ways which have been combated have been felt. 
The Chiapas conflict mediator said that the peace agreements 
will not be the result of discussions at a negotiating table but 
of the willingness of each member of society to contribute his 
part for the common well-being. 
  The San Cristobal de las Casas bishop indicated that Chiapas 
had contributed to the nation's richness by its sacrifices and 
now it contributes to the enhancement of a new nation as it 
progresses in the construction of peace. Samuel Ruiz thanked 
the EZLN for their serious and appropriate list of petitions. 
Of Manuel Camacho Solis he said: We are now united on a common 
road, while he thanked him for his sincerity and eagerness to 
attain successfully a general consensus in the first stage of 
the dialogue. 
  To conclude, the bishop said that the San Cristobal de las 
Casas cathedral will be protected in order to subsequently hold 
the final meeting of the peace and reconciliation efforts that 
will be preceded by initiating the implementation of the 
agreements. [sentence as heard]

  [Text] San Miguel Ocosingo, 3 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Negotiators 
from the armed group in the State of Chiapas today started 
returning to their Indian communities in southeastern Mexico 
after holding talks with Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho 
Solis. Escorted by the International Red Cross and 
nongovernmental organizations, the delegates left the San 
Cristobal de las Casas Cathedral, 1,200 km southeast of Mexico 
City, for their hometowns. These delegates will inform their 
communities about the results of their dialogue with Camacho 
Solis in which they received promises to meet their economic, 
political, and social demands for upgrading the living standard 
of the Indians. 
  The results of nine days of talks at the cathedral require 
the approval of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and local 
Indian communities before they can be transformed into a peace 
agreement. 
  As he saw off eight of the 19 delegates in San Miguel 
Ocosingo, Camacho Solis insisted on implementing initial 
agreements on meeting the needs of the Indians to avoid loosing 
the hope and trust achieved during the dialogue. "At this time 
no one can fail to honor his word because that would actually be 
tantamount to failing Mexico," the commissioner said as he saw 
off the delegates headed by "Subcommander Marcos," military 
chief of the armed group. 
  The dialogue began on 21 February to find a political 
solution to the conflict the group initiated on the first day of 
this year to present Indian demands by occupying towns and 
attacking the military. This forced the Mexican Army to 
intervene. 
  In Las Margaritas delegate "Juan" also urged those involved 
to comply with the agreements to avoid putting "distance between 
the two parties."

<F P=106> [Report by Gloria Perez Mendoza] </F>
  [Text] Toluca, Mexico, 28 Feb -- Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, 
president of the National Human Rights Commission [CNDH], has 
termed the observations by Amnesty International (AI) that the 
CNDH is an organization with no authority that is dependent on 
the federal executive as "hasty and politically motivated." In 
addition, Madrazo Cuellar stressed that the CNDH just began 
investigating, from the compiled evidence, the events that 
occurred at the Morelia ejido in Chiapas. He reiterated that 
the forensic experts and criminologists are working to reach a 
conclusion. 
  After attending the annual report presentation by Mireilla 
Roccatti Velasquez, president of the State Human Rights 
Commission (CEDH), Madrazo Cuellar said that regarding the 
threats, intimidations, and burning of property near San Carlos 
Hospital in Altamirano, the governor of Chiapas "decided to 
launch a preliminary investigation, and we will be expecting the 
results." The human rights ombudsman [preceding word in English] 
stated that in certain areas of Chiapas some cattlemen have 
"manipulated" the population to protest against the work of the 
CNDH. He added: "They are trying to promote their spurious and 
illegitimate interests." 
  Madrazo Cuellar reported that there have been new reports 
regarding EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] actions, 
above all cattle rustling, invasion of rural properties, and 
burning of peasant and Indian homes in the area," [no opening 
quotation mark as published] and he said that there were no 
reports against the Mexican Army. 
  During the report presentation by Mireilla Roccatti, 
Governor 
Emilio Chuayffet Chemor called for the decentralization of the 
state organization and the creation of municipal commissions on 
human rights in the 121 municipalities of the state. 
  Additionally, Roccatti noted in her report that of the 2,492 
complaints received as of 31 January, 1,693 have been 
investigated. This represents a progress of 67 percent in 
resolving cases.

  [Text] Canada and Mexico have agreed to work together to 
push for an end to the U.S.-imposed trade embargo against Cuba. 
Canada's foreign minister, Andre Ouellet, and his Mexican 
counterpart, Manuel Tello, met in Mexico City yesterday, and 
they said it is time to convince the U.S. to end the isolation 
of Cuba. Neither Canada nor Mexico observe the U.S.-led 
embargo. The embargo has been in force since the 1960's.

  The election of the OAS secretary general will take place in 
Washington, D.C. on 27 March. The new secretary general, who 
will take office on 20 June, must garner at least 18 of the 34

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Octavio Ochoa] </F>
  [Text] La Paz, Baja California Sur, 28 Feb -- The Chamber 
of Deputies and the Senate, through a special committee, will 
soon present to the Foreign Relations Secretariat a legal 
proposal to renegotiate with the United States the International 
Treaty on Limits and Waters [Tratado Internacional de Limites y 
Aguas] signed by the two countries in 1944, because the 
neighboring country has flooded the soil of Mexicali and Tijuana 
with saltpetrous water and infected it with agrochemical and 
fecal residues, thus rendering all that territory uncultivable. 
  A total of 30,000 hectares have been affected, and this 
caused not only huge losses to wheat crops but also to human 
life (from 1979 to 1992) due to the emergence of new and 
fulminating diseases such as acute meningoencephalitis, which 
attacks the brain directly and kills in less than 72 hours. 
  Legislators of all parties met here today with jurists, 
researchers, and specialists on this issue to discuss the 
problem and determine the terms and juridical recourses that 
could be used to renegotiate and renew this treaty with which 
the United States has failed to comply for the past 20 years. 
  In 1993 alone Mexico received from tributaries of the 
Colorado River in the United States 10 million cubic meters of 
mud in which large concentrations of sodium, magnesium, and 
calcium were detected. They "have ruined the productivity of 
the land and have irreversibly contaminated human life, flora, 
fauna, and aquatic life." Moreover, as was already mentioned, 
also detected in those waters were the free-living protozoan 
amoebas [protosoario amiba de vida libre], which reproduce when 
in contact with organic matters, such as feces, and cause 
diseases such as the aforementioned acute meningoencephalitis 
which affects people swimming in such waters. This problem 
worsened last year when the Colorado River overflowed into the 
Mexicali Valley. This nearly flooded the city. As a result, 
the Permanent Committee of the Chamber of Deputies instructed 
the Border Affairs Committee to verify the scope of the damage 
and determine whether the overflowing of the Colorado River 
violated the treaty in question. 
  A special subcommittee chaired by Deputy Javier Cital 
Camacho 
conducted the respective study and concluded that "the 
provisions contained in the International Treaty on Limits and 
Waters signed by Mexico and the United States are inadmissible 
and unfair to our country." 
  The document was also signed by Ernesto Enciso Clark and 
Rafael Morgan of the National Action Party [PAN]; Marta 
Maldonado of the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD]; Jorge 
Tovar Montanez of the Popular Socialist Party [PPS]; Rogelio 
Appel Chacon, Oscar Garzon, and Luis Moreno Bustamante of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party; and Javier Colorado Pulido of 
the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution. In this document 
they concluded that there is no compatibility between the 
hydraulic systems of the two countries, and thus, the flow 
[desfogue] of solid matters that ends up at the Morelos Dam 
"provokes permanent storage and contamination of our waterways 
[vasos]." This is "highly and dangerously harmful to the 
Mexicali and San Luis Rio Colorado Valleys." 
  For these reasons they proposed renegotiating the treaty to 
turn it into a document that "promotes the principles of good 
neighborliness, international respect, fair treatment, and good 
intentions." They also pointed out that a new treaty should 
include the San Luis Rio Colorado Valley, Sonora, and the Gulf 
of California Mar de Cortes. They said that the United States 
must expand its ability to retain solid matters at water bodies 
above the Gila River and promote the construction of reservoir 
systems and regulators to prevent the flow of mud, among other 
things. 
  These proposals were revealed today during a forum to 
analyze 
the treaty. It was headed by Governor Guillermo Mercado Romero 
and Agustin Basave Benitez, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies 
Border Affairs Committee. Also present at the forum were Jose 
Ramirez Roman, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Health 
Committee; PAN members Tomas Esparza Carlos, Ernesto Encizo, and 
Rafael Morgan; PRD member Marta Maldonado; PPS member Jorge 
Escobar; and specialists Rodolfo Moreno Dahma, Maria Valdes, 
Luis Flores Lui, Manuel Ortega, and Jesus Roman Galleros. 
  The latter, who is a researcher at the School of the 
Northern 
Border and in charge of the Environmental Studies Department, 
said that this issue is extremely delicate and requires an 
urgent solution because concentrations of salt of 2 kg per cubic 
meter of water coming from the United States have been detected. 
This, he added, is without taking into account the organic 
residues and mud coming from the other side of the border. 
"Water coming from the United States is completely contaminated, 
and this is so because the dam system along the Colorado River 
is the most controlled system in the world." It contains 2,500 
km of water flow controlled by 39 dams that at the lower end 
release into Mexico a heavy load of contaminants from 
agroindustrial residues. 
  In a speech Agustin Basave warned that this string of 
problems with the United States threatens to deteriorate our 
bilateral relationship. He added that in this case a definitive 
or "lasting" [de largo aliento] solution must be sought, because 
it is no longer advisable to postpone discussion or a possible 
renegotiation of this issue. 
  [Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish on 3 March carries a 
600-word article on page 4 stating that: "Following more than 11 
hours of negotiations, the Chamber of Deputies Border Affairs 
Committee has decided to propose to the government of the 
republic a `review' of Act 242 on limits and waters signed with 
the United States instead of proposing a 'renegotiation' of the 
entire treaty, because the latter would create more conflicts 
between the two nations." Committee Chairman Agustin Basave 
points out that this issue will be brought up at the upcoming 
Mexico-U.S. binational meeting in April at the Port of Huatulco, 
because this problem "is increasing tension in the relations" 
between the two countries.]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments relating to the Mexican elections 
scheduled for 21 August 1994. Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
presidential candidate for the PRI, Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, visited Villa Hermoza on 22 February, capital of Tabasco 
State. Peasants briefed him on the agriculture and 
cattle-raising sectors. He said: "We must first admit what has 
not worked in order to make corrections. One of things that has 
not worked, and we have to correct it, is the federal 
government's relationship with Tabasco State." Colosio gathered 
a record crowd of 30,000 people. (Mexico City Radio ACIR 
Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 23 Feb 94) 
  PRI candidate Colosio ended his Tabasco State campaign and 
began touring Campeche where he visited the Cuatro Caminos 
neighborhood, one of the poorest, and noted the peoples' 
demands. During a meeting with the Cambio 21 Foundation, he 
pledged to work for federalism to strengthen states and 
municipalities. 
  On the subject of Campeche oil, he said: "Out of every $100 
of crude exported, $65 originate from Campeche. We must do our 
best to ensure that this oil exploitation brings more benefit to 
the people of Campeche." 
  Meanwhile, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential 
candidate for the PAN, National Action Party, received a call in 
Mexicali from Manuel Camacho Solis, Peace and Reconciliation 
Commission representative in Chiapas. Camacho Solis said talks 
with the Zapatist National Liberation Army are going well. 
Cevallos said: "I took the call while I was here at the 
University, and he said the talks are progressing well and that 
he hopes to have news for us soon...." Cevallos met with law 
students at the University of Baja California. He said the 
country's problems are political and already solved, others, 
like the economy and social problems will be solved gradually. 
  In another report, Marcela Lombardo, presidential candidate 
for the PPS, Popular Socialist Party, campaigned in Mexico City 
and met with the Worldwide Association of Women Journalists and 
Writers. There, she spoke of her party's development project 
proposal and said in part: "...with regional planning, to take 
advantage of all the resources from each of the country's 
resources." 
  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, presidential candidate for 
the 
PRD, Party of the Democratic Revolution, campaigned in Guerrero 
State and spoke out against political bosses, authoritarianism, 
abandoning the Indians, and in favor of democracy. He said: 
"Right now, we are proposing changes to the electoral law and 
open elections." 
  Lastly, the PT, Workers Party of Mexico, registered its 
political platform with Federal Electoral Institute, IFE, 
authorities. Presidential candidate Cecilia Soto headed the 
delegation and she handed the document to IFE General Director 
Arturo Nunez. She then held a news conference where she said in 
part: "...our proposals do not include constitutional reforms. 
It would be very difficult to reach an agreement on this." 
(Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 24 Feb) 
  On 24 February, PRI and PARM, Authentic Party of the Mexican 
Revolution, parties delivered their political platforms to IFE 
authorities. IFE General Director Arturo Nunez said: "The 
electoral platforms highlight several ways to understand Mexico, 
to see its problems, and offer solutions from each party's view 
point." (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in 
Spanish 1300 GMT 25 Feb 94) 
  PRI candidate Colosio ended his political tour to Merida 
and continued on to Quintana Roo State where he said the August 
elections must be exemplary to inspire confidence and added: "I 
want to be the president of Mexico to democratically change our 
country." 
  PAN candidate Fernandez de Cevallos visited Sinaloa State 
and told businessmen his party had not made political agreements 
in the electoral processes. He said the PRD had received more 
benefits than his party in the preelectoral conflicts. He 
responded to Confederation of Mexican Workers, CTM, leader Fidel 
Velasquez' charges against him by saying: "The union sector is a 
progovernment, boss-controlled game preserve which does not 
accept democracy. This cannot continue." 
  During her visit to Tlaxcala State, PPS candidate Lombardo 
Otero summoned interested parties and candidates to a meeting to 
discuss a different economic program that will satisfy the needs 
of the Mexicans and create more jobs. 
  PRD candidate Cardenas initiated a three-day tour to 
Michoacan state to outline his political platform. 
  Rafael Aguilar Talamante, Cardenist Front for National 
Reconstruction Party, PFCERN, presidential candidate, attended a 
political rally in Mexico City and said: "To prompt the changes 
the country requires, it is imperative we use the power of the 
vote instead of the destructive power of weapons, intolerance, 
or violence." He called for the reasoned vote to prevail over 
the retaliation vote. 
  PPS and PRD parties registered their political platforms at 
IFE for the 21 August federal elections today. Counting these 
two parties, eight political parties have registered their 
platforms at IFE, only the PFCERN has not presented the 
corresponding document. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in 
Spanish 0430 GMT 26 Feb 94) 
  At a meeting with the IFE General Council today, "the nine 
registered political parties approved important agreements to 
ensure clean and honest elections in August." The main 
agreements were: "1) To request the Criminal Law be revised so 
it clearly stipulates what electoral crimes are and increases 
the punishments." 2) Approval of electoral observers. They, 
however, "have to be Mexican citizens who agree to take a 
training course, are not registered in any political party, and 
have not run for any public office in the past three years. 3) 
Pending approval of the Attorney General's Office, a special 
Electoral Crimes Prosecutor's Office will be created." 4) The 
function of auditing the electoral register will be publicly 
auctioned. "5) The Federal Government will give political 
parties an additional 10 percent for political training, 
socioeconomic investigations, and expenses for editorial tasks. 
The parties will receive more than 19 million new pesos for 
those activities." 
  Pablo Emilio Madero, presidential candidate of the National 
Opposition Union, UNO, campaigned in Nayarit State. He met with 
students and invited "all Mexicans to use their electoral card 
because it will allow them to make changes in the country." 
  Jorge Gonzalez, presidential candidate of the Mexican Green 
Ecologist Party, toured Mexico State. He said "alternate 
technology is an ecological answer to resolving the lack of 
basic services such as drinking water." (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 1 Mar 94 
  Manuel Camacho Solis, Commissioner for Peace and 
Reconciliation in Chiapas, has tried to stop persistent rumors 
about his aspirations to the Mexican presidency, and he told 
reporters: "I have nothing to add regarding personal issues. 
Right now, I am dedicated to my work. Once the peace 
agreements are signed, I will comment on what I expect to do 
next." 
  Political and media speculations have noted that Camacho's 
political perspectives will increase if the conflict in Chiapas 
is resolved prior to 15 March, the deadline for political 
parties to register their candidates for the 21 August 
presidential elections. PRI has announced that its candidate, 
Luis Donaldo Colosio, will register on 4 March. (Madrid EFE in 
Spanish 0649 GMT 3 Mar 94) 
  PPS candidate Lombardo campaigned in Yucatan and spoke out 
against foreign electoral observers at the August elections. She 
said "the political parties themselves have to guard the 
elections." 
  PRD candidate Cardenas visited Mexico City Ibero-American 
University and spoke about the Chiapas agreements. He said: "It 
seems the government has started to respond to the demands." 
Cardenas was interrupted several times by students who protested 
because he had not attended a previous meeting. 
  A Mexico City voters registration office official reported 
more than five million people in Mexico City already have the 
corresponding voter's card. (Mexico City XEW Television Network 
in Spanish 0435 GMT 3 Mar 94)

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Salvadoran elections, 
scheduled for 20 March. 
  Unity Movement presidential candidate Jorge Martinez has 
advocated the promotion of a moral market economy based on "the 
ethical values of man that serve as the root for the 
construction of an economic order oriented toward the promotion 
of increased national well-being" and which will accomplish this 
objective "by better distributing economic resources, by 
securing sustained economic growth, and by an equitable 
distribution of income." Martinez explained that "the system's 
stability depends on social justice." (San Salvador LA PRENSA 
GRAFICA in Spanish 24 Feb 94 p 8) 
  A poll conducted by the Jose Simeon Canas Catholic 
University 
and Central American University reveals that the majority of the 
people have little interest in the elections process, do not 
trust the elections process or the country's elections, and have 
no trust in the state's institutionality. The poll reveals that 
36 percent of the people have not decided yet who they will for 
vote on 20 March. The poll reveals that what the people most 
want is jobs, fighting crime, and the end of poverty. What the 
people most want, the poll reveals, has to do with the economy, 
and then with crime. (San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish 
1800 GMT 24 Feb 94) 
  Nationalist Republican Alliance, Arena, presidential 
candidate Armando Calderon Sol has regretted the 24 March attack 
on Miriam Diaz, a leader of the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front, FMLN. He said: "Violence has been left 
behind. The Salvadoran people are tired of violence, including 
verbal violence, to say nothing of physical violence. We regret 
this event, we condemn it, we repudiate it, and we are asking 
that a thorough investigation be conducted." He emphasized that 
attacks are not the road, "elections are the road, democracy is 
the road." (San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800 GMT 25 
Feb 94) 
  Arena candidates for the 20 March elections, including the 
presidential and vice presidential candidates, Armando Calderon 
Sol and Enrique Borgo Bustamante, respectively, have met in San 
Salvador to work out the final details of the elections. Arena 
sources say this is the only party that has representatives in 
the most remote corners of El Salvador. (San Salvador Radio 
Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800 GMT 2 Mar 94) 
  Roberto Escobar, the presidential candidate for the National 
Conciliation Party, PCN, responded to a question on his party's 
platform by stating: "All the economic measures envisaged in 
our political platform are congruent with the improved social 
well-being of Salvadorans. We understand social well-being," he 
noted, "as the satisfaction of educational, health, housing, 
recreational, sports, cultural, and spiritual needs." He 
explained that economic and social development cannot be 
separated. (San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 1 Mar 94 p

  [Text] Mexico City, 3 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemalan 
Government and guerrilla representatives agreed that the human 
rights issue is the first and foremost point in the peace 
negotiations which began in Mexico City today. Hector Rosada, 
chairman of the government's Peace Commission, said the human 
rights issue will be the first point to be addressed in this 
round in an attempt to resolve it "because it has already been 
discussed previously." They will also decide on the timetable 
of the agenda for subsequent meetings. 
  Rolando Moran, leader of the Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity [URNG], emphasized that human rights must be 
"the first point discussed in the meeting. Agreements in this 
area have already been reached and signed with the previous 
government. There are a number of points that have already been 
signed. We have to base ourselves on them and discuss 
them...therefore, the human rights issue is the first topic to 
be discussed, mainly because of its importance in Guatemala," he 
added. The guerrilla leader said human rights are very 
important, as shown by Argentine expert Monica Pinto's report 
presented at the Geneva meeting on the situation in Guatemala. 
  Today in Mexico, the government and the URNG General Command 
resumed talks to end the armed conflict in the Central American 
nation which has lasted for more than 30 years. The government 
delegation of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio also includes 
General Carlos Pineda, deputy chief of staff; Gen. Arnoldo 
Balconi, Army inspector general; and Gen. Victor Argueta, 
commander of the Honor Guard. Commanders Gaspar Ilom, Pablo 
Monsanto, Rolando Moran, and Carlos Gonzalez, and members of the 
Political-Diplomatic Commission are participating in the 
guerrilla delegation. 
  Today, UN-appointed mediator Jean Arnault met separately 
with 
the two sides to find points of concurrence. In January in 
Mexico City, the two sides agreed to resume the negotiations 
after they were suspended for eight months because of former 
President Jorge Serrano Elias' self-inflicted coup. The 
government and the URNG held talks for the first time in Mexico 
City in April 1991. Only relative progress has been achieved to 
end the conflict that has caused more than 100,000 deaths and 
left 50,000 missing.

<F P=106> [Report by David Flores Castillo; quotation marks as </F>
published] 
  [Text] In an analysis of her visit to Guatemala, Lucette 
Michaux-Chevry, French minister delegate of humanitarian action 
and human rights, noted that her country supports the 
pacification process that is being advanced here although "one 
of the main obstacles to attain peace is the refusal to hold 
talks." 
  "I have seen, however, that there is hope, dedication, and 
work among Guatemalans. That is very important, but I think 30 
years of internal armed struggle is too much for a multi-ethnic 
nation, although I must make it clear I did not come from France 
to pass judgment or teach lessons. Based on her country's 
experience, where there was slavery and exploitation, "one never 
achieves a perfect democracy; one always has to move to 
strengthen it," and that is the role Guatemala must play, 
"because that commitment exists among Guatemalans, and my 
country, France, supports that initiative." 
  Based on her experiences in Ixcan, Quiche, she stated the 
Guatemalan people's spirit is always high because they are ready 
to obtain a better future through work and respect for their 
human, economic, and social rights. "The basis for a solution to 
the nation's problems and the strengthening of democracy 
constitute the fundamental pillars to building peace for the 
peoples, especially for the people of Guatemala and Latin 
America where exploitation and poor distribution of land is 
almost a widespread problem. 
  The French official added: "When I return to my country, I 
will report that the people of Guatemala want to have the right 
to work and live." Michaux-Chevry's remarks coincide with the 
United Nations call to the government and Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity to resume their peace talks on 3 to 7 March.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 2 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Human rights 
associations today denounced the Guatemalan Army's reinstating 
in the past days "the capture or hunting of youths" as part of 
obligatory military recruitment. 
  The National Commission of Guatemalan Widows [Conavigua] 
said 
Army troops have been visiting villages in the interior of the 
country since last February to recruit youths. 
  Conavigua stated in a communique: "The mothers, sisters, and 
wives of Guatemala protest once again against the abrupt, 
indiscriminate manner in which the Army is implementing an 
obligatory recruitment." 
  According to the report, youths are "captured" when they 
leave school, mass, the market, or when walking in the square. 
  Conavigua has referred to the Army's recruitment as a 
"brutal 
hunt." 
  Conavigua also criticized the Army's never telling families 
their sons have been taken to military detachments for 
recruitment; therefore, relatives are kept in the dark for quite 
a while regarding their whereabouts 
  Conavigua stated the persecutions were conducted such 
municipalities as Coatepeque, Momostenango, Totonicapan, 
Patzite, and El Estor, and in the country's interior, as well as 
in other municipalities in the central Department of 
Chimaltenango and the western Department of Quetzaltenango. 
  International human rights organizations such as the 
Guatemalan Human Rights Ombudsman's Office, which is the 
independent human rights UN specialist in Guatemala, and the 
Guatemalan Mutual Support Group [GAM] have requested the 
government regulate or ban the current recruitment practices. 
  GAM consists of Colombia, the United States, Mexico, Norway, 
Spain, and Venezuela.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Guatemala City Teleonce Television in 
Spanish at 0350 GMT on 1 March during its "Telepress" newscast 
broadcasts a 38-minute recorded news conference by President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio with foreign and domestic reporters. The 
place and date of the news conference are not given. 
  De Leon begins by announcing that on 28 February he sent 
three draft laws to Congress, one of which calls for reforms to 
the Electoral and Political Parties Law that will reduce to 76 
the number of deputies and for making possible the participation 
of civic committees in the elections. 
  The president adds that another draft calls for reforms to 
Article 201 of the Penal Code in order "to punish more severely 
the individuals responsible for kidnapping, as this is one of 
the crimes that harms society the most." De Leon explains that 
"prison sentences for kidnappers will be increased to 25 and 30 
years, instead of the 8 and 15 years currently in force," and 
that capital punishment -- which is now being applied only if 
the kidnaped person dies during the action -- will also be 
applied "if the victims are defenseless, such as minors, persons 
over 60 years old, and women, as well as if the victim suffers 
severe injuries." The third draft is the president's veto of a 
decree that made reforms to the Social Welfare Institute of 
Journalists. 
  Answering a reporter's question on the issue of human rights 
and capital punishment, de Leon answers that "there is a 
convention that establishes diminishing and possibly eliminating 
capital punishment," and "it is up to Congress to examine this 
issue carefully." With regard to recent visitors, de Leon 
answers another question by saying: "Today I had the honor of 
receiving the French minister delegate of humanitarian action 
and human rights and the German vice chancellor. The Guatemalan 
Government and president were very pleased to receive from the 
French minister not only a ratification of support for the 
Government of Guatemala, but also to receive from the French 
people and Government recognition of the efforts the people and 
Government of Guatemala are making to preserve and strengthen 
our democracy." On the same subject, the president adds that 
the German vice chancellor "reiterated Germany's economic, 
technical, and moral support for Guatemala." 
  The reporters then ask de Leon Carpio about the public 
health 
situation, to which he responds that he had an urgent meeting 
today with the health and finance ministers to discuss the 
purchase of medications and the payment of old debts so the 
hospitals may receive urgently needed supplies, such as oxygen 
tanks.

<F P=106> [Report by Julio Armando Valdez] </F>
  [Text] Continuing with our report on currency devaluation, 
National Congress President Carlos Roberto Flores suggested a 
national plan to stabilize the lempira. The national assembly 
president believes such a plan is necessary, and is opposed to 
an official currency devaluation. Flores believes the lempira's 
interbank value should remain unaltered in order to guarantee 
the country's economic stability. 
  National Congress President Carlos Roberto Flores Facusse 
was 
asked his opinion about recent statements made by [Central Bank 
President] Hugo Noe Pino on the possibility of officially 
devaluating the national currency. 
  [Begin recording] [Flores] I believe those statements, which 
I honestly did not hear in context, were probably not 
interpreted as they were stated. Anyway, I am going to tell you 
my personal opinion. The Central Bank president will, in turn, 
have to clarify what he really meant to say. 
  I do not believe the lempira should continue to be 
devaluated. On the contrary, instead I believe the country 
should decide to adopt some decisions with respect to preparing 
a national project, which will ensure our national objectives. 
One of those objectives is currency stability. One of the 
country's main goals is to prevent any further currency 
devaluation. The only thing devaluation causes is negative 
collateral effects. For example, it generates more inflation. 
As we have already stated, inflation is one of the most vulgar 
taxes we can impose on the Honduran people. 
  In this respect, what should prevail is a willingness to 
seek 
different options, which are available to us and will provide 
more stability to the lempira. Instead of believing we are 
going to have a lempira that will be constantly devaluated, what 
we should try to ensure is a more stable currency. We should 
also seek to implement the most effective measures and join 
efforts in a national project that will encourage production, 
increase our exporting capability, stimulate investment, and 
provide more confidence to the economic sector as well as 
strengthen our markets. The objective of all of this is to more 
perfectly ensure economic stability. 
  [Valdez] The devaluation factor will be eliminated, which 
would entail an official devaluation. What is Congress' 
position with respect to this? 
  [Flores] With respect to this issue, I believe that since, 
at 
this time, the currency is subject to market fluctuations, what 
should currently prevail is an attempt to strengthen the 
currency. In other words, the fact that the National Congress 
has taken steps to approve changes in the customs devaluation 
factor is aimed more towards eliminating devaluation effects on 
the country's currency. In other words, what we are attempting 
to do is make the lempira more secure, confident, and stable. 
We must try to implement the necessary measures so as to 
provide the country with more economic stability. 
  [Valdez] Will the National Congress accept any initiatives 
aimed at devaluating the currency? 
  [Flores] National devaluation is not an initiative that must 
be presented before the National Congress. Neither is it an 
initiative which, as rumors says, the Honduran Central Bank 
expects to take. Currency devaluation occurs in terms of what 
takes place in a market, like the one that is currently 
operating, which is precisely a supply and demand market. 
  In reforming the decree, we have attempted to control the 
customs devaluation factor. We have done so to such an extent 
as to indicate that before changes are made the National 
Congress must first approve it. The objective of all this is to 
inject confidence into the market and to say that far from 
depreciating the currency, what we want is more stability. Now, 
the only way to prevent the lempira from devaluating is to 
initiate a national project with mechanisms to amend some of the 
economic problems we are currently confronting. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Ernesto Ugarte Calderon; from the "Five O'Clock </F>
Sharp" newscast] 
  [Text] Although Dr. Arnoldo Aleman Lacayo has made promises 
on the Atlantic Coast, it is very unlikely he will be able to 
keep them, given the complexity of the economic and social 
aspects, Brooklyn Rivera, governor of the Northern Atlantic 
Autonomous Region [RAAN] and leader of the Yatama Indian 
Movement, has stated. I do not believe in the alliance between 
Arnoldo Aleman and Steadman Fagoth. Fagoth is unstable, has 
been going from one extreme to the other, Rivera stated this 
afternoon at the Supreme Electoral Council office in Metrocentro. 
  Had we not participated in the vote-counting process on the 
Atlantic Coast, we would have given the impression of being 
incompetent. Leading troops is not the same as being political 
leaders and presenting a political platform. We are not 
thinking of any political agreements before 1996, Nicaraguan 
Resistance [RN] Commanders Jose and Johnson have stated. 
  The Liberal Constitutionalist Party, PLC, is anticipated to 
be the election winners in the upper and central region and 
lower valley of Rio Coco, as well as in Siuna sectors one, two, 
and three. The PLC is expected to follow a similar trend in 
Halban, Pancazan, and Nueva York neighborhoods in the city of 
Bluefields. Dr. Mariano Fiallos Oyanguren, Supreme Electoral 
Council president made the previous statement at a news 
conference held a few moments ago.

will demobilize, which, together with the initial group, will 
add up to 50 percent of the rebel troops. 
  The last contingent will demobilize on 16 April, at which 
time the rebel leader, Jose Angel Talavera, alias El Chacal, 
will also disarm.

<F P=106> [Article by Reinaldo Antonio Tefel] </F>
  [Text] If we listen to the language that the political 
factions of Sandinism and other parties use, we notice right 
away that they agree on the need to democratize party programs 
and structures. This is positive because it offers the hope that 
party unity can be preserved through a convergence around 
several items in our program. Regrettably, however, three basic 
divergences underlie the formation of the factions within 
Sandinism: violence or public spirit, elitism or equality, and 
single-person leadership or collective, democratically monitored 
governance. 
  The first two divergences are reflected in parallel articles 
by Julio Lopez Campos and Dora Maria Tellez, who are well-known 
representatives of two factions. 
<H5>  Violence or Public Spirit </H5>
  Whereas Dora Maria Tellez gives this categorical reply to 
the 
journalist's question: "All methods of struggle are valid, 
except the armed struggle and (of course) every violent form of 
struggle," Julio Lopez, while ruling out armed struggle as an 
immediately viable option, says this about violence in the 
social struggle: "If this is called violence, then we on the 
left cannot be against it." 
  We in Nicaragua have been immersed in the subculture of 
violence, exclusion, and annihilating victory over one's 
adversaries. For the first time in our history the FSLN 
[Sandinist National Liberation Front] achieved peaceful change 
from a ruling political movement to one of a different kind. We 
are obliged historically and morally to continue the democratic 
process of dialogue that we ourselves began. Sandinism must 
annihilate not our adversaries but rather the culture of 
violence, and we must begin by banishing it from our minds and 
behavior in public and party life. What happened to the UNO 
[National Opposition Union] must not happen to us. Because the 
UNO stubbornly locked itself up in the culture of violence by 
demanding the overthrow of the government because it failed to 
annihilate the Sandinists, it disintegrated as an alliance 
thanks to the good sense of a major segment of its defunct core. 
<H5>  Elitism or Equality </H5>
  Julio Lopez affirms his faith in democracy, only to 
contradict himself later by upholding the elitism that has 
crippled and destroyed so many revolutions. In this regard he 
says: "But our party cannot be a party in which all members are 
equals. We must acknowledge the merits of the unselfish and 
self-sacrificing." I ask myself: Who will decide who is 
unselfish and self-sacrificing? Only the people, through 
transparent elections, can so decide. 
  Dora Maria is categorical once again in describing the 
democratic nature of the FSLN: "...eliminate the categories of 
affiliate and activist and leave a single one for all: member." 
Without at least relative equality there can be no democracy. 
Major political, economic, social, and cultural differences 
often prevent true democracy, or at least hamper it. Can a 
democratic-revolutionary party build elitism into its party 
structures? Would it be truly democratic? Would it be truly 
revolutionary? 
<H3>  Single-Person, Authoritarian or Collective, Democratic 
Leadership </H3>
  On this point I am no longer talking about the two 
aforementioned articles but rather about the entire Sandinist 
political debate and actual events, inasmuch as the proponents 
of the first approach are not very explicit. 
  We all agree that the National Directorate (DN) has already 
played its historic role; it even accepts a change of name. 
Nonetheless, there is a well-organized movement to transfer the 
pre-eminent position and powers that the DN had to a specific 
post: secretary general. The argument then runs that this 
individual must be elected directly by the Congress in order to 
strengthen the post and raise it above the collective leadership 
bodies. Although it is not being said expressly within 
Nicaragua's presidentialist, caudillo-dominated political 
atmosphere, this would mean creating a single-person, 
authoritarian leadership as an organizational fact. Underlying 
this approach is the mistaken belief that revolution is 
synonymous with authoritarianism, that strongly autocratic 
leadership is needed. 
  This belief is at odds with history, because 
authoritarianism 
or caudillismo swamps a revolution. The French Revolution lost 
its democratic, republican direction with Bonapartism, and the 
Russian Revolution bureaucratized socialism and blinded 
democracy with Stalinism. 
  This is why many of us have called for a collective, 
democratic leadership: the Sandinist Assembly, with its own 
Governing Board, as the highest legislative body, representing 
the Congress, and the 25-member Sandinist National Council as 
the executive body that reports periodically to the Sandinist 
Assembly. In order to aid the functioning of the National 
Council, which will meet monthly, it will elect from among its 
members a Standing or Executive Commission of seven national 
secretaries who will report monthly to the National Council. The 
first of these secretaries will, of course, be the secretary 
general or political secretary, who will have important, 
specific functions but not predominant ones, and will not be 
above the other party structures. This will ensure truly 
effective and democratic operations and leadership, inasmuch as 
the Standing Commission can be responsive and dynamic and, at 
the same time, will be overseen by the National Council under 
which it functions and of which it is a part. 
  We must remember that for many years the FSLN boasted of 
having a collective leadership. Although it was a top-down 
leadership, it did not consist of a single individual. We must 
develop and bring up to date the positive aspects of Sandinist 
history and denounce our own mistakes. Only in this way will we 
be able to become the democratic party of the great majority of 
the Nicaraguan people.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Excerpts] The Workers Property Area, known as APT, is 
barely off the ground but is already making itself felt in the 
economy because of the influence that it has in certain areas, 
mainly agriculture and livestock. 
  Most of the enterprises that make up the APT today were sold 
to the workers or leased to them with promises that they would 
be sold. They were in deplorable financial condition, however, 
and their equipment and facilities were clearly run down. 
  In many cases the workers have sought domestic and foreign 
partners, while in others they are facing serious financial 
difficulties since they cannot get loans because they do not yet 
have documents legitimizing their ownership. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Organization and Management in the APT </H5>
  Definition and nature of the APT: There is no totally 
accepted, widely discussed definition of the APT yet. There are 
only interpretations based on the economic and social "Consensus 
Accords" that have emerged from the privatization of state-run 
enterprises that has been going on since 1991 and on the 
organizational process in which these enterprises now find 
themselves. 
  The following definition has been drafted with the aim of 
stimulating discussion that will lead to consensus on a clear, 
precise meaning of the term. 
  APT is understood to mean "the group of enterprises in 
which, 
under their system of ownership, the workers participate as 
shareholders (majority or minority), thus forming a new 
grass-roots economic sector based on the struggles of the 
working class and their trade-union grievances relating to the 
social ownership of the state-run sector created by the 
Sandinist People's Revolution." 
  The enterprises of the APT have been established as 
corporations under the national legal system. Owing to their 
origin, their goal is collective profits, which differentiates 
them from traditional private enterprise. 
  The following are some of the differences and similarities 
that have been identified: 
<H5>  Traditional Private Enterprise </H5>

  -  One or several partners--Goal: profits 
  -  Partners investing 
capital 
  -  Heavily dependent on bank loans 
  -  Some degree of union 
activity 
  -  Wage-earning employees 
  -  Considerable managerial 
capability 
  -  Marketing experience 
  -  Individual 
profits 
  -  Labor/management relations 
  -  Economic and financial 
plans 

<H5>    APT Enterprise </H5>

  -  Many worker partners--Goal: profits 
  -  Partners investing 
capital 
  -  Heavily dependent on bank loans 
  -  Union 
self-management 
  -  Wage-earning employees and owners 
  -  Basic 
managerial capability 
  -  Little marketing experience 
  -  Collective 
profits 
  -  Partner/worker relations 
  -  Socioeconomic plans 

    What type of partners are there in the APT? 
  The law permits different categories of shares, establishing 
differences between partners in accordance with what kind of 
shares they hold. 
  Some Labor Corporations (14) have specified in their 
constitutions and bylaws that all shares are registered. They 
have, however, established another category that takes into 
account the labor relationship between the enterprise and the 
partner. There are thus two kinds of shares: "A" and "B." 
  --Type A shares are all those that are in the possession of 
partners who are working in the enterprise. Type B shares are 
those that are in the possession of partners who chose not to 
continue working in their enterprise. 
  --The rights of partners vary according to the type of share 
(A or B) they hold. Partners with type A shares will be entitled 
to vote at meetings. Partners with type B shares have the right 
to attend and speak at meetings but cannot vote, and other 
restrictions on the exercise of the right arise from this. 
Partners with type B shares may not hold any managerial post in 
the enterprise. 
  --The two types of shares confer equal rights in the 
distribution of profits. 
  In other enterprises in the APT there is no difference 
between partners, regardless of whether they are working or not; 
thus, they have equal rights at meetings (to speak up and vote), 
the same right to seek administrative posts, and an equal share 
in profits. 
  If a worker is an owner in an enterprise, can he be fired? 
What happens then? 
  In the case of APT enterprises, shareholder rights do not 
guarantee a permanent job, inasmuch as this depends on the 
efficiency and responsibility of each worker. People must 
realize that jobs cannot be guaranteed to the detriment of the 
enterprise's finances. 
  Ultimately, a worker's job will depend on the enterprise's 
economic potential and the effective use of manpower. An 
owner/worker can be justifiably dismissed in order to safeguard 
the profitability and production efficiency of the enterprise 
and to protect collective assets. 
  Nevertheless, a worker who is fired or decides to leave the 
enterprise retains all his rights as a shareholder. 
  Dismissal should be the last resort, inasmuch as an 
enterprise has several ways of helping its worker/partners and a 
wide range of options for their direct employment. The following 
are some options that both agricultural and industrial 
enterprises have tried: 
  --Rotation of work shifts 
  --Work on credit 
  --Lowering wages 
  The following can be regarded as options for indirect 
employment in the event of payroll cuts in the agricultural, 
industrial, or services sector: 
  --Work on family parcels 
  --Temporary harvest work 
  --Work as a distributor, commission agent, or salesperson 
in one's hometown 
  --Others 
<H5>  The Initial Capital of APT Enterprises </H5>
  The agricultural and industrial APT enterprises were created 
by Presidential Resolution No. 109-91 (see Cuaderno No. 10, 
Annex 3 of Cipres [Center for Sociological Research]). The first 
to win contracts with Cornap [National Corporation of the Public 
Sector] were the agricultural enterprises, which negotiated 
resources from the state-run corporations Agroexco, Hatonic, 
Cafenic, Bananic [Nicaraguan Banana Enterprise], Nicarroz, and 
Trabanic. 
  An initial group of industrial and services enterprises 
concluded negotiations in early 1993 and acquired enterprises 
from the COIP [People's Industrial Corporation], Conilac, Corcop 
[People's Commercial Corporation], Cotur, and other agencies. 
  The initial capital of the APT enterprises is the capital 
that the state-run enterprises had at the time of the 
negotiations; it consists of land, plantations, machinery, and 
other resources and was acquired under lease and purchase 
contracts with the owner (the State).

  [Excerpt] Panama City, 3 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- On 2 March, a 
jury declared former General Manuel Antonio Noriega and a former 
officer of the extinct Panama Defense Forces [FDP] guilty of the 
murder of Major Moises Giroldi, who headed a "military coup" in 
October 1989 against the former "strongman" of Panama. The jury 
ruled that Noriega, who was toppled by the U.S. Army in December 
1989 and is serving a 40-year sentence for drug trafficking, was 
the instigator of Giroldi's murder. The judicial file stated 
that on 4 October Giroldi was shot 15 times in the back on the 
patio of the extinct FDP headquarters. 
  Former Major Heraclides Sucre was also found guilty of 
murder. He was the actual perpetrator of the murder and was 
tried in absentia. The jury acquitted the other three remaining 
defendants in the case: former Captains Ramon Diaz, (who was 
also charged with actually committing the murder), and Camilo 
Vega and former Mayor Lucinio Miranda, who were tried for 
complicity in the crime. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Orlando Mendieta C.] </F>
  [Text] A poll requested by LA PRENSA and conducted by the 
Dichter &amp; Neira consulting company has revealed that 
presidential candidates Ernesto Perez Balladares, who garnered 
the support of 37.3 of those polled, and Ruben Dario Carles, 
with 20.5 percent of those polled, have the largest number of 
followers in their bid for the presidency of Panama. 
  The survey was conducted nationwide, and 1,753 people were 
polled from 25 to 27 February. This is the first poll conducted 
since 8 February when the Electoral Tribunal closed the 
registration period for candidates to elective office. According 
to the poll, Perez Balladares continues to be the favorite 
candidate, with his support increasing by 5 percent. The poll 
revealed that if the elections were held today, 37.3 percent of 
the people would vote for Perez Balladares. This reflects an 
increase in the number of followers of the PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party] candidate. He registered a 32.1 percent 
popularity rate in the last poll taken on 27 January. 
  Meanwhile, Ruben Carles, presidential candidate for Molirena 
[Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement], Morena [National 
Renewal Movement], and Civic Renewal parties, came in second 
place with 20.5 percent. Carles' popularity rate rose 7.3 
percent from the previous poll, in which he placed third with 
13.2 percent of the votes. 
  Ruben Blades, Papa Egoro Movement's presidential candidate, 
suffered the largest decrease in popularity in this poll by 
registering only a 9.9 percent popularity rate, which placed him 
third among the candidates chosen to win the 8 May election. 
Blades registered 18.9 percent in late January. 
  As for the other presidential candidates, the poll showed, 
in 
descending order, that Mireya de Gruber of the Arnulfist Party 
registered 8.1 percent, Eduardo Vallarino of the Christian 
Democratic Party (PDC) registered 3 percent, Samuel Lewis 
Galindo of Solidarity Party registered 2.8 percent, and Jose 
Salvador Munoz of the Doctrinaire Panamenist Party registered 
0.2 percent. Compared to the previous poll, Gruber's popularity 
rating decreased by 1.7 percent. Vallarino, meanwhile, in his 
first appearance in a poll showed a 3-percent popularity rate, 
which is lower than the 4 percent that his fellow party member 
Ricardo Arias Calderon registered before withdrawing his 
candidacy due to health problems. As for Lewis Galindo, his 
popularity increased by 2 percent, while Munoz appeared for the 
first time in the voters' preference list.

newscast] 
  [Text] Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon met with 
President Guillermo Endara this morning to discuss several 
topics, including banana export problems. Amid tight security, a 
protocol ceremony was held at the stairs of the Presidency of 
the Republic to receive the Costa Rican president. The 
republican band played both national anthems to welcome Rafael 
Angel Calderon Fournier. 
  [Begin Calderon recording] We are both ending our respective 
terms. Currently, relations between Panama and Costa Rica are 
excellent and this is how they should always be between two 
fraternal countries. We are going to talk a bit about our 
bilateral relations and the banana situation which is so 
important for both countries, including the struggle in which 
all the Latin American banana-producing countries are engaged. 
[end recording] 
  Later the Panamanian president awarded Calderon the Manuel 
Amador Guerrera Order. In the presence of all his ministers 
Guillermo Endara recognized the neighboring country's support 
for Panama. President Calderon Fournier awarded the Panamanian 
president the Juan Mora Fernandez Order, represented by a gold 
plaque. Presenting Endara with the award, Calderon highlighted 
the role played by the president in the struggle against the 
military dictatorship.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments relating to the Panamanian elections 
scheduled for 8 May. 
  Ruben Dario Carles, "Change 94" presidential candidate, 
travelled to Colombia where he met with Colombian President 
Cesar Gaviria to discuss economic issues that will 
``undoubtedly'' benefit the socioeconomic development of Panama. 
On this occasion, Carles also met with Argentina's President 
Carlos Menem, who was also visiting Colombia. (Panama City EL 
SIGLO in Spanish 25 Feb 94 pp 16, 17) 
  Carles told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that if he is elected 
president on 8 May, he will send a delegation to Washington on 9 
May to renegotiate the U.S. military presence in exchange for 
economic benefits. Carles accused the Democratic Revolutionary 
Party, PRD, of "waging a friendly opposition campaign against 
the government." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 
28 Feb 94 p A1) 
  "Change 94" presidential candidate Carles said once he is 
elected president, he will organize a commission to promote 
investments and the creation of jobs. "This commission will be 
placed directly under the president and will be composed of 
representatives from business groups, worker associations, and 
the government. All investment projects will be presented to 
them." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 
1 Mar 94) 
  Yesterday, Mireya Gruber, Arnulfist Party presidential 
candidate, said that just because a party member meets with an 
official of a former regime does not mean her party wants to 
negotiate with the military. With regard to presidential 
candidate Carles' interest in talking to the military, she 
limited herself to saying: "I imagine that as a politician he 
will want to talk to all sectors." (Panama City LA PRENSA in 
Spanish 26 Feb 94 p 5A) 
  Fernando Manfredo, Papa Egoro vice presidential candidate, 
denied rumors of disagreement with the party's presidential 
candidate Ruben Blades, as has been rumored in political 
circles. Manfredo said: "The voters appear somewhat cynical; 
they are not impressed by those demagogic speeches and false 
promises. I think this is the current campaign's tendency." 
(Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 23 Feb 
94) 
  Yesterday, PRD candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares returned 
from his trip to the United States, where he met with U.S. 
investors. Perez Balladares told the media upon his arrival that 
he had met with the board of directors of the NEW YORK TIMES and 
THE MIAMI HERALD, and contacted the Latin Chamber of Commerce 
and the Miami mayor. Perez Balladares said: "We established ties 
to work jointly in possible investments and trade exchanges 
starting 1 September." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in 
Spanish 2300 GMT 23 Feb 94) 
  Perez Balladares said that if he wins the May elections he 
will not grant amnesty nor pardon former civilian and military 
collaborators of the former regime, if they have been found 
guilty of committing a crime and sentenced. (Panama City LA 
PRENSA in Spanish 25 Feb 94 p 1A) 
  Perez Balladres travelled to Mexico City to meet with Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate. 
Perez Balladares said: "Had I been president, I would have 
investigated more thoroughly General Torrijos' death." (Panama 
City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 26 Feb 94 p 1) 
  Perez Balladares thinks candidate Carles' offer to solve the 
nation's main problem in 100 days "is an insult to the 
Panamanian people's intelligence." In statements to LA ESTRELLA 
DE PANAMA, Perez Balladares said it was "very irresponsible" to 
request that U.S. military bases remain after 2000. (Panama City 
LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 28 Feb 94 p A1) 
  Presidential candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo of the National 
Consensus Alliance called ``irresponsible'' statements by former 
Health Minister Guillermo Rolla Pimental, who said money used by 
breweries and the PRD in political campaigns are generated by 
money laundering and drug trafficking." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA 
DE PANAMA in Spanish 26 Feb 94 p 1) 
  Although the most recent polls do not favor candidate Lewis 
Galindo, yesterday he admitted he does believe in this type of 
information. In addition, he criticized presidential candidate 
Carles for not "adequately managing" the public debt when he was 
comptroller general. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in 
Spanish 26 Feb 94 p A1) 
  Lewis Galindo told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that military bases 
must not be offered to the United States if they do not ask for 
them because "one must maintain one's dignity. The public must 
be consulted" regarding any proposal on this issue, said Lewis. 
(Panama City, LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 28 Feb 94 p A1) 
  On 25 February Lewis Galindo presented his state 
modernization program. He hopes to improve the nation's public 
administration with the program. Lewis Galindo said: "We must 
put our house in order. Those who think that because they have 
personal contacts and relationships, they can obtain funds and 
credits are making a serious error and are mistaken. Until we 
have a modern, flexible state that does not hinder local 
investors, much less foreign investors, we will not achieve 
anything." (Panama City Telemetro Television Network in Spanish 
1730 GMT 28 Feb 94) 
  Four of the seven Panamanian presidential candidates 
participated in the inauguration of CADE 94, the Annual 
Conference of Business Executives, today in Bambito, Chiriqui 
province under the slogan, Concrete Alternatives for Development 
of the Western Part of the Nation, that is, Chiriqui and Bocas 
del Toro. Ruben Dario Carles, "Change 94" candidate, denied 
accusations that he had paid international financial 
institutions. Samuel Lewis Galindo, National Consensus Alliance 
candidate; Eduardo Vallarino, Christian Democratic Party 
candidate; and Ernesto Perez Balladares, PRD candidate, spoke in 
the afternoon. Mireya de Gruber, Arnulfist Candidate; Ruben 
Blades, Papa Egoro candidate; and Salvador Munoz, Panamenist 
Doctrinate Party candidate, sent messages saying they would not 
participate in the conference. (Panama City Circuito RPC 
Television in Spanish 1730 GMT 26 Feb 94) 
  Electoral Tribunal President Guillermo Marquez estimates 
that 
between 350,000 to 375,000 voters will not go to the polls on 8 
May. Recent polls indicate that 20 to 25 percent of the voters 
will not vote. Marquez indicated that 40 to 50 international 
observers will be present at the 8 May elections. (Panama City 
LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 1 Mar 94 p 1)

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 2 Mar (NA) -- The 100th retirees' 
demonstration ended on 2 March with violent clashes between 
leftist group members and police who responded violently after 
being stoned for about 30 minutes, with an initial toll of about 
50 people injured, including more than 20 police officers. 
  The demonstration, which started outside Congress and ended 
outside Government House, was carried out during President 
Carlos Menem's official visit to Spain. 
  About 30 people were detained during the violent incidents 
and taken to various police precincts, especially Buenos Aires' 
2d Police Precinct. 
  While more than 20 police officers, including seven women, 
were treated at Churruca Hospital, UCR [Radical Civic Union] 
legislators reported that UCR members had been carried to the 
Ramos Mejia Hospital where they are convalescing from the 
injuries they suffered "during the repression." 
  The situation became very unclear and dramatic when a group 
of demonstrators reported that a 15-year-old suffered serious 
injuries in a clash with the forces of order. 
  Miguel Zarate, a Permanent Plenary of Retirees Organizations 
[Plenario Permanente de Organizaciones de Jubilados] leader and 
the only speaker at the demonstration, pointed out that there 
would be "thousands of Wednesdays more until this program that 
intends to ruin workers and retirees is defeated." 
  After championing the apportioned social security system 
"that was established more than 90 years ago," Zarate asked the 
political parties and the trade unions that supported the 
demonstration "to join the retirees in their struggle to defeat 
this economic program and abolish the private retirement system 
until the people's final victory is achieved." [passage omitted] 
  Earlier, a group of demonstrators had burned a U.S. flag at 
the intersection of Hipolito Yrigoyen and Balcarce Streets. 
  Afterward, a large number of blunt objects were hurled at 
police cordons deployed outside Government House. The cordons 
comprised about 200 police, including men and women. 
  During these violent and unclear incidents, Plaza Lavalle 
Retirees [Jubilados de Plaza Lavalle] leader Norma Pla threw a 
burning placard that had been lying on the ground near a 
barricade at police. 
  Burning placards, pieces of floor tiles, sticks, stones, and 
all kinds of blunt objects were hurled at the security forces, 
who tried to protect themselves from the attack. 
  For about 30 minutes, police deployed outside Government 
House resisted the attack while about 50 police officers ran to 
equip themselves with plastic shields. 
  Meanwhile, a group of police, wielding teargas launchers, 
was 
deployed against the demonstrators. 
  Journalists, some of whom were hit by the blunt objects 
hurled by the members of leftist parties, were caught in the 
middle of the clashes and sought shelter behind a Channel 13 
mobile unit. 
  In the middle of the incidents, U.S. Ambassador James Cheek 
entered Government House through the esplanade on Rivadavia 
Street. He was quickly surrounded by police to protect him from 
the blunt objects. 
  During the attack, five police officers, including a woman, 
were hit by the blunt objects hurled by the demonstrators and 
collapsed. 
  Meanwhile, people were running all over the square, trying 
to 
escape from the incidents and from the effect of the tear gas 
that began to fall on the troublemakers. 
  With their eyes covered with handkerchiefs, sweaters, and 
T-shirts, those who caused the incidents constantly charged 
police to hurl the blunt objects with more violence. 
  When the group that caused the disturbances began to leave 
Government House, the police forces unleashed a violent 
repression, charging with nightsticks and tear gas against the 
demonstrators who were dispersed in every direction. 
  Under intense teargas fire, police pursued the demonstrators 
on Defensa Street until reaching Hipolito Yrigoyen Street, where 
several demonstrators were detained. [passage omitted]

Committee. [passage omitted] 
  Humberto Ochoa, leader of the La Paz Labor Union Federation, 
announced that the strike will be total, that it will be 
observed by workers, teachers, and school and university

  [Begin Ochoa recording] All the La Paz Civic Committee

fact that the construction of the Cotapata-Santa Barbara Highway 
has not been awarded to any construction company yet; the La Paz 
Department budget, which includes university and city hall 
budgets; and the Bolivian budget as a whole. This is why we 
have decided to stage a 24-hour strike with all the members of 
the aforementioned organizations. [end recording]

March. 
  The Central Bank has reported that the Uruguayan public 
sector's gross foreign debt increased $33 million, or 0.8 
percent, and that the net foreign debt dropped 4.1 percent in 
the first 11 months of 1993. The gross foreign debt was $4.1688 
billion late in November, $35 million less than late in October,

the consumer price index rose 1.43 percent in February, the

  [Text] The International Drug Control Board has pointed out 
that little or nothing has been done to fight drug trafficking 
in Colombia. We asked presidential candidates and hopefuls, if 
elected, how would they confront the problem? How would they 
fight drug trafficking in the country? 
  [Begin recording] [Liberal Party presidential hopeful 
Ernesto 
Samper] The policy that President Cesar Gaviria has been 
implementing is the best: demobilizing the drug cartels and 
subjecting them to the law by offering them a safe prison and a 
fair trial. Legalizing drugs in Colombia is not viable right 
now because people might interpret it as granting amnesty to 
drug trafficking. 
  [Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana] 
I 
insist it cannot be legalized. Statistics from the countries 
that have legalized drugs or from the U.S. states that have 
legalized marijuana always show that consumption has increased. 
This is why I insist on education and prevention programs. 
  [Liberal Party presidential hopeful Humerto De la Calle] I 
say we should broaden drug trafficking policies to ensure that 
developed countries, in particular, become more efficient at 
controlling consumption, money laundering, precursor chemicals, 
and weapons. [end recording]

  [Text] A prosecutor obtains an arrest warrant against a 
mayor upon finding a 15,000-peso discrepancy in an account, and 
another charges a widow with homicide solely because she did not 
attend her husband's funeral. 
  A special prosecutor demands money from the potential 
targets 
of his investigation, and others do not attend court proceedings 
and later allow court orders to be falsified. 
  Investigations and arrests are overturned because of 
inconsistencies, as in Adelina Mesa's case, who was accused of a 
terrorist attack in Bogota, and prosecutors are blamed for 
inconsistencies in a number of cases. 
  All these episodes seem to have finally exhausted the 
patience of Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta. His staff 
is now handling 1,200 investigations of prosecutors. In a letter 
to Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, he revealed the 
system's Achilles heel: arbitrary actions and negligence on the 
part of a number of prosecutors. 
  Arrieta issued a forceful criticism: some prosecutors 
initiate legal action hastily and without solid evidence, 
thereby violating the principle of [presumed] innocence and due 
process. 
  In his letter, the attorney general announced the immediate 
start of new investigations because these abuses still persist, 
even though in May 1993 he had issued warnings concerning these 
abuses, also in a letter to the prosecutor general. 
  De Greiff agrees that there are serious irregularities in 
the 
work of some of his subordinates, but says they do not reach the 
extreme cited by the Attorney General's Office. 
  "We," De Greiff told EL TIEMPO, "do not conceal anything 
from 
a sense of esprit de corps; we do not protect people because 
they are in the Prosecutor General's Office. We are not saints, 
but we try to be." 
  During his 18 months at the Prosecutor General's Office, De 
Greiff has investigated 656 prosecutors in internal procedures. 
To date 238 investigations have been concluded; 418 are still 
under way. 
<H5>  Director of Prosecution Offices </H5>
  The National Director of Prosecution Offices, Ana Montes, 
who 
coordinates prosecutors all over the country and whose office 
maintains statistics on decisions issued by prosecutors acting 
as trial judges, has her own view of the matter. 
  Montes agrees that "it is time to look at what is going on," 
but she explains that many of the complaints are filed when the 
party affected by a decision calls for a disciplinary or penal 
investigation against the prosecutor. 
  Still, the Attorney General's Office believes that the 
problem goes far beyond that. As an example, they say that 
prosecutors have been initiating legal proceedings against 
municipal officials who in the end prove their innocence. 
  "On many occasions ignorance of administrative contracting 
provisions and regulations or of budget systems has caused legal 
action to be initiated and municipal officials to be suspended 
who later (...) must be returned to office." 
  "All this," explains the attorney general, "could be avoided 
if prosecutors studied the situation thoroughly before 
initiating legal proceedings." 
  However, De Greiff and Arrieta both seem to agree that the 
time has come to apply a firm hand.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Juan Carlos Wasmosy before a joint </F>
session of Congress in Asuncion on 1 March] 
  [Excerpts] Honorable congressmen, I come before you, the 
representatives of the people, to fulfill a constitutional 
responsibility according to which I must give an account of the 
executive branch's performance, particularly for the almost 200 
days of administration by the government I am honored to preside 
over. 
  It is not the first time I have spoken before this honorable 
Congress. I spoke before it during my inauguration on 15 August 
1993 and again on 12 October 1993, that time to offer my 
solidarity and constitutional and legal guarantees to the 
honorable senators and deputies who felt threatened by the 
regrettable incident we are all very well aware of. 
  First, I will make an analysis of the general state of the 
nation, making clear the state of the administration I 
inherited. Then I will talk about specific plans and projects 
being implemented or that will be implemented in the near 
future, full details of which are included in the account and 
specific area plan. 
<H5>  Guidelines </H5>
  I have said many times in our country and abroad that the 
Republic of Paraguay is living -- like almost every other Latin 
American nation -- in a new era, the real sense of which must be 
interpreted in order to stem fears and abort the dangers that 
sometimes seem to loom threateningly above us and are often 
encouraged by misunderstanding and impatience. 
  The euphoria with which we expressed our happiness for the 
freedoms we won during the government of General Andres 
Rodriguez -- today an illustrious senator for life -- and the 
democracy we are starting to build continue to be accompanied by 
the negative effects of underdevelopment with its frustrating 
burden of intolerable poverty and its chronic and suffocating 
lack of capital investments. 
  The inequality that characterizes our political, economic, 
and social structures is the hurdle burdening our creative and 
productive forces and obstructing and making difficult our 
access to standards of living more in accordance with our human 
condition. 
  However, these same social structures also have given 
strength to the century-old struggle of our people -- and 
finally helped to victory -- against the autocracy that 
maintained the state of inequalities and our permanent 
backwardness, and to our struggle against annoying 
discriminations and irritating privileges. 
  The path of peoples who never renounced their freedoms and 
stubbornly fought to develop their democracies has been long and 
full of hardships. But that path also granted them the 
tranquility of consolidated institutions, progress earned with 
hard work and strict and conscious discipline, well-being that 
is a product of joint efforts, and the participation in its 
benefits. 
  That is the road we Paraguayans chose because we are a 
people 
who love freedom, because we are a people who want to live in 
democracy, because we have an unrestrained wish to overcome 
poverty, and the disposition to work hard to develop our society. 
  This decision, which is the same adopted by countries 
seriously determined to face the struggle against poverty, 
recognizes the need to dismount the old, obsolete, and unfair 
structures of our present-day society and replace them with 
structures proper to a modern and essentially humanist society. 
<H5>  The Political Question </H5>
  We inherited a country used to strong governments, a country 
that did not know of freedoms and democracy, and was 
characterized by distorted institutions, administrative 
negligence, and extended corruption in an obscure period of 
inquisition, our own so-recent middle ages. 
  But we also inherited the commitments to build the Paraguay 
of tomorrow that we are building on the strong foundations of 
honesty with new airs of freedom and with the steel of our old 
and permanent courage, which makes us the owners of a history 
full of heroes and unforgettable events. 
  Once the anachronistic structures have been removed, we 
still 
will need to complete and consolidate the new institutional 
system, requiring deep legal changes. 
  Perhaps the situation in which the president of the Republic 
finds himself is sufficient proof of this need or shortcoming: 
Article 184 of the Constitution says this report must be read on 
1 March while Article 238 says it must be offered on 1 July. 
  This example lacks, of course, the relevance of the 
misunderstandings that our different government branches have 
often had and that are really artificial. I will come to talk 
with this Congress' honorable members as many times as necessary 
to try to solve these misunderstandings, and I reiterate that 
the doors of my office will stay open for talking and working 
with the honorable legislators. 
  The very hard task of correcting, updating, and completing 
our legislation must be speeded up so that our process can have 
a very vital ingredient: security. A security in which peace 
and order are the products of the effective implementation of 
the freedoms recognized by the Constitutions and the laws. 
  Security and facilities for all types of transactions. A 
security that must become, in the end, a synonym of stability 
and trustworthiness. 
  Fortunately -- we must congratulate ourselves for it -- 
Paraguayan political leaders and the honorable senators and 
deputies were able to express all their patriotism and goodwill 
when accepting the democratic agreement that we signed at 
Government Palace on 13 January, where we reconciled our 
different opinions and moved ahead in the already unpostponable 
reorganization of the judicial branch. 
  The significance of this agreement, however, goes beyond 
its concrete objective and becomes not only a guiding element 
but also a method we should definitely use to reach agreement on 
the differences that will inevitably and necessarily emerge. 
  The Multiparty Board of the Governability Pact, which is 
made 
up of important political forces, is an experiment to have a 
mechanism that will gather and study proposals by complementing 
the government's action to make them into immediate, medium-, 
and long-term projects. 
  Naturally, these actions will not disregard the executive 
branch's exclusive and unrenounceable right to run the country. 
  It would be ungrateful not to point out here that the fluid 
and permanent communications I maintain with Congress and the 
actions of the vice president of the Republic made this 
political agreement possible. 
  The fruitful relations the vice president and I are 
maintaining with the different political organizations have made 
the creation of the Governability Pact possible. 
  The lack of democracy in the past left us an inheritance of 
accumulated vices affecting the character of our institutions. 
This inheritance is embedded as an invisible evil in the wounds 
left open in the heart and minds of everyone. 
  Only through our daily practice and good training will we be 
able to gradually change the attitudes and methods that are 
still affected by arbitrary decisions, ignorance, fear, lack of 
action, and privilege seeking. 
  The struggle for democracy is a daily demand that we open up 
to freedom; there must be responsibility toward democracy, 
respect for its rules, and the commitment not to make democratic 
rules into simple instruments seeking the survival of the ideas 
and vices that nourished the old regime's spirit. 
<H5>  National Defense and Public Security </H5>
  The first results obtained from the reorganization and 
restructuring of the public forces made up of the Armed Forces 
and the police, the renewal of their high leadership, and the 
professionalization and gradual improvement of the personnel's 
work conditions are encouraging. 
  The nation's Armed Forces under the command of Gen. Andres 
Rodriguez fulfilled a significant historic role, and we should 
never forget that they were the participants of change when they 
were able to listen to and interpret the people's demands. 
  The nation's Armed Forces are engaged in reorganizing and 
redirecting their operational and development plans in order to 
adjust themselves to the new Paraguayan situation. 
  Their priority objective is to improve their effectiveness 
in 
the military field based on the professionalization and training 
of their human resources to improve their operational 
capabilities in order to fulfill their constitutional mission. 
In order to do that the following actions in the area of human 
resources were taken: 
  Improve the third-level education of the Military College 
through the signing of an agreement with the Catholic University 
of Asuncion's Academic Association. 
  Train and improve the military cadre through scholarships 
from friendly countries with which we maintain military exchange 
programs. 
  Permanent special training of the cadre at all levels 
through 
the different courses offered by the Armed Forces training 
institutes. 
  Mandatory military service is the means by which the Armed 
Forces completes their cadre to carry out their constitutional 
mission. Based on new guidelines, the training programs have 
been reorganized, emphasizing social and moral education, 
medical and dental attention, adult education against 
illiteracy, and basic training for the conscripts. This has been 
well received by the population as shown by the massive presence 
of conscripts for military service. 
  In the field of military justice, the military courts are 
fulfilling their constitutional function with efficiency. 
  The laws related to military matters and those referring to 
the Armed Forces structure and organization will be changed in 
order to better answer the dynamic needs of the service. 
  The Social Communication Center was created at all levels 
with the advice of competent national and foreign professionals. 
  The Armed Forces, which are aware of the structural changes 
demanded by technological development, are engaged in a profound 
reorganization of personnel, materiel, and the redistribution of 
their area of influence. The justification for this is worth 
mentioning: 
  1. Strengthen the Armed Forces to appropriately face the 
challenge of the 21st century. 
  2. Rational use of human and material resources. 
  3. Change the heavy structure for a more functional and 
flexible one. 
  4. Exploit the Armed Forces' deterrent power by supplying 
them with the technological means to carry out their mission. 
  5. Allow a rapid transition to an active defense 
organizational structure. 
  In order to achieve the aforementioned objectives, military 
units are being relocated in order to streamline and improve 
their operation in the quest for better control, coordination, 
communication, and economy. This measure requires a 
reprogramming of the Armed Forces' real estate assets. 
  Thus the Army Headquarters has moved from its old site on 
Venezuela Street [in Asuncion] to new and modern premises in 
Mariano Roque Alonso. The Military Training Institutes Command 
(CIME) and six of its components are operating on the premises 
of the old Arsenal. 
  The Joint Staff's reorganization to fit the role of advisory 
body for the commander of military forces allowed it to reduce 
from the nine departments it originally had to four, thus 
cutting bureaucratic red tape and releasing military personnel 
for reassignment elsewhere in the country. 
  The Military Forces Command and its General Staff have a 
balanced proportion of officers from each branch of service, 
which paves the way for the exchange of information necessary to 
set the Armed Forces' strategic course. 
  By effectively combining its resources with those of Dinac 
[National Directorate for Civil Aviation] for air traffic 
control and detection, the Air Force will be able to efficiently 
discharge its constitutional mission of protecting the 
sovereignty of the nation's air space. Resources are being 
combined in order to economize. 
  Armed Forces resources allow it to carry out a yearly 
average 
of 90,000 medical appointments, 3,600 surgical operations, and 
to provide conscripts with approximately 4,000 prostheses per 
year. [passage omitted] 
  The Paraguayan Navy owns the country's largest shipyard and, 
according to Law No. 70/55 dated 31 March 1955, it is authorized 
to render services to third parties. 
  Using funds obtained from such services, the Navy recently 
launched two vessels capable of carrying vehicles and personnel. 
These ships were built at Navy shipyards by Paraguayans alone, 
which helped save foreign currency and train specialists and 
technicians. 
  It should be pointed out that for the third consecutive year 
Navy Radio, which is part of the Inter-American Naval 
Telecommunications Network, has been chosen best station of the 
year among its peers from the other American countries. 
  I would like to express my satisfaction over the favorable 
reaction to the general call to fight crime, and I urge the 
people and the news media not to justify actions taken outside 
the framework of the law. One should always bear in mind that 
poverty is not a license to break the law. 
  Through the National Police Law this administration is 
changing the role of this institution and restoring its image of 
service to the people. This law paves the way for the 
reorganization of the National Police and allows it to purge its 
cadres, promote its best men, and specialize its personnel. 
  The executive branch is committed to giving the National 
Police all the necessary support, as has been demonstrated by 
the recent delivery of equipment aimed at giving policemen the 
protection they deserve to carry out their mission: bulletproof 
jackets and individual firearms. In the very near future the 
National Police will have hundreds of police cars, 
four-wheel-drive vehicles, 50 motorcycles, a communications 
network, and the helicopters that are essential for the job. 
  I hope, along with the rest of the citizenry, that we will 
soon have a highly professional National Police, agile and 
well-equipped to fight organized crime, which is a worldwide 
scourge on our society. 
  Your Honors are no doubt aware of the burning and urgent 
need 
to review and update our criminal laws, the laws that can help 
reconcile the objectives of the central government, departmental 
governments, and municipalities, and the laws that have to do 
with the allocation of resources or these entities. 
  The draft Criminal Code of Laws that the executive branch 
has 
withdrawn from Congress currently is the target of a broad and 
democratic debate in which some 30 organizations, including 
universities, are participating. 
<H5>  The Role of the State </H5>
  The state must without fail become the most active, 
enthusiastic, and zealous promoter of this process. Naturally, 
in order to fully comply with this essential task, the state's 
role must be reoriented and restructured in keeping with the new 
Constitution and the short-, middle-, and long-term objectives 
it has been entrusted with. 
  The draft bill on this subject we will send to Congress in 
the short term is fully inspired by the will to reinstate a real 
republican quality, that is, the property of everyone. 
  Only in this manner will the state attain the confidence, 
support, and perhaps the love of our people. Only in this manner 
will the best available human resources join the administration. 
Only in this manner will we attain the level of excellence 
required for the government's superior and meaningful mission. 
Only in this manner will we manage to replace the costly, 
inefficient, and shapeless state apparatus we inherited. Only in 
this manner will we attain a strong and respected government. 
  This is why we organized a data base of the professional 
capability of public employees, including their expertise, age, 
family status, post, and seniority. We already are using this 
data base to prepare human resource policies for the public 
sector. 
  Simultaneously, based on profuse reference material that had 
to be prepared beforehand, we prepared a draft bill to replace 
the Public Employee Statute. This constitutes another element to 
promote the state transformation process we seek. 
  As an example, the president of the Republic periodically 
receives a "Situation Report" on the performance of the main 
economic variables and a "Quantitative Report on the Execution 
of the Central Government Investment Budget," which are very 
useful in making decisions. 
  The "Priority Criteria for Public Investment Projects" and 
the "1994 Government Public Investment Program" already have 
been defined while a Five-Year Plan is being prepared. 
  The fact that I mention these basic instruments for 
administration greatly demonstrates the poor and regrettable 
conditions in which democracy took control of the state. 
<H5>  The Economic Matter </H5>
  Within the context of globalization, competitiveness has 
internationalized and is becoming increasingly more demanding. 
  We, as a nation and a system, have the duty of adapting to 
this context, following the best strategies necessary for our 
reality. The following information will demonstrate to you some 
of the most relevant aspects of our economy and the direction we 
are giving it. 
  In the macroeconomic field, the GDP increased 3.7 percent. 
This is a greater increase than the one in the last two years. 
  Economic reactivation will be spurred through better 
harvests, and the GDP could increase by more than 4 percent in 
1994. This will promote sustained growth in subsequent years. 
  The 20 percent inflation rate in 1993 was the result of a 14 
percent increase in the dollar exchange rate, a 23.5 percent 
increase in the money supply, and cautious economic behavior 
during the election period. The 1994 macroeconomic guidelines 
are aimed at curbing inflation through fiscal balance and a 
moderate expansion of the money supply to strengthen the 
atmosphere of reliability for investors. 
  The high 3.1 percent population growth index per year 
demands 
the creation of more jobs. High harvest production rates for the 
main agricultural products plus the first results of 
agricultural diversification in 1994, like grain, corn, 
vegetables, and other crops, will improve economic activity and 
determine the increase of demand for labor. 
  Public and private investments were scarce as a result of 
the 
slow execution of public programs and the dwindling of private 
initiative. Public investments dropped from 2.7 percent to 2.5 
percent of the GDP while private investments dropped from 22.4 
percent in 1991 to 20.2 percent in 1992 and 20.0 percent in 1993. 
  It is estimated that public investments will increase to 4 
percent of the GDP in 1994. The government will introduce new 
measures this year to promote private investment such as the 
creation of medium- and long-term financing mechanisms and the 
promotion of joint national and foreign investments. It is 
estimated that the private investment projects that will be 
channeled through the different ministries will amount to more 
than $250 million, while the investments authorized in 1993 
thanks to Law No. 60/90 will continue being developed. 
  Rural development in general and agricultural 
diversification 
in particular are the priority subjects of this government 
policy. Evidence of this is that through the new Agricultural 
Financing Program the government has, for the first time, 
disbursed on time 350 billion guaranies allowing agricultural 
diversification and facilitating the praiseworthy efforts of the 
peasants. [passage omitted] 
  Agriculture had a significant recovery during 1993 compared 
to the previous year and production grew 4.4 percent. This 
growth compares favorably with 1992's 2.1 negative growth. 
  The improvement was due mainly to the increased production 
of 
soybean, which totalled 1.7 million metric tons, cotton in 
branch with 430,000 metric tons, wheat with 360,000 metric tons, 
sunflower with 33,000 metric tons, corn with 650,000 metric 
tons, and other agriculture products. 
  The export of agricultural products produced 72 percent of 
the hard currency earned by the country. Livestock and forestry 
produced 23 percent. This means that agriculture and forestry 
produced 95 percent of our total registered exports during 1993. 
[passage omitted] 
  The industrial sector has maintained an interesting rate of 
capital investments, absorbing 32 percent of the total of 420 
billion guaranies channeled in accordance to Law No. 60/90 on 
investments. 
  In order to face the growing competitiveness of the world 
market and Mercosur's [Common Market of the South] challenge it 
is necessary to give more dynamism to our industrial 
reconversion process. In order to assist companies in this 
endeavor the government created the Industrial Development Fund, 
which will act as a second-level bank to channel internal and 
external medium- and long-term financial resources to industrial 
concerns through the private financial system. 
  This fund will have resources of up to $300 million that 
will 
represent investments from our internal savings, the assistance 
of multilateral financial institutions (IDB, BIRD 
[Inter-American Development Bank, World Bank]), and financial 
aid from various countries' government agencies. The funds will 
be assigned to finance activities capable of producing 
nontraditional exportable products. 
  We will consolidate the mechanism for protecting industrial 
and intellectual property rights through patent and trademark 
laws and strong actions to eliminate forgeries and illegitimate 
copies. 
  The implementation of a $12 million IDB credit line to 
assist 
small companies will allow the Industrial Development Service 
(SEI) and MIC [Industry and Commerce Ministry] regional offices 
to add financial to technical assistance. Such assistance will 
be extended to artisans through the National Service for Artisan 
Development. 
  The central government closed the 1993 fiscal year with a 
balanced budget. The consolidated public sector, including 
public companies, ended the year with a surplus of 1.6 percent 
of the GDP. 
  This means that the public administration's budgetary 
situation as a whole improved substantially during 1993, 
particularly as of August. 
  The new government implemented important control measures to 
improve revenues. As a result, the average monthly fiscal 
income, which totalled 132 billion guaranies up until 15 August, 
increased to 175 billion guaranies in the following months, that 
is, a 33 percent increase. 
  The implementation of the national budget was largely behind 
schedule before 15 August, but we recovered during the rest of 
year. 
  By mid-August, budget disbursements represented 53 percent 
of 
the total disbursed during 1993, that is, the average 
disbursement was 90 billion guaranies per month. The rate of 
disbursements increased to 126 billion guaranies in the last 
part of the year, allowing the government to fulfill a large 
percentage of its budget schedule and permitting us to close the 
year with the financing of 96 percent of the budget scheduled 
for financing with ordinary resources and 78 percent of the 
budget scheduled for financing with Itaipu Binational royalties 
and compensations. [passage omitted] 
  The transformation of public companies into private 
companies, in addition to providing better service to consumers, 
also will bring fiscal savings. 
  The savings from the elimination of subsidies and credits to 
public companies, as well as the income to be received from the 
transfer of the companies to the private sector, will be used in 
public health, education, and agriculture. 
  The urgent need for privatization can be seen in the 
indicators showing how the budget is sacrificed to financing 
inefficient companies. 
  Maintaining the Paraguayan Railway System demands a big 
budget that is 3.831 billion guaranies for 1994. 
  Every year the state pays the State Merchant Fleet's foreign 
debt. In 1994 it will pay more than $5 million in addition to 
the $81 million already paid in the past. 
  The assets for the bidding on the State Merchant Fleet are 
11 
billion guaranies, but it will be revalued to reflect its real 
value in order to encourage investors for its privatization. 
  Paraguayan Airlines Inc. [LAPSA] needs state contributions 
each year, which in 1993 amounted to $16 million. A demand by 
some creditors has recently compelled the state to pay $2.1 
million, while overdue and unpostponable obligations amount to 
approximately $5 million. 
  LAPSA's monthly operational losses amount to $1.3 million. 
Liabilities to be paid by the state amount to $42 million. The 
executive branch called for special congressional sessions for 
urgent study of a special law authorizing the transfer of 80 
percent of company shares to the private sector, reducing the 
state's liabilities by approximately $20 million. 
  We have listened to the following question many times: 
Should the state produce rum? The former Apal [Paraguayan 
Alcohol Administration] is being liquidated. It was converted 
into a corporation, Canas Paraguayas, Inc. (Capasa). 
  The state owns 100 percent of the shares of Flomerpasa 
[Paraguayan Merchant Fleet, Inc.], LAPSA, and Capasa. On 28 
March, I received these companies' shares, which will be 
deposited in the Treasury's General Directorate. 
  Flomerpasa delivered shares for 8 billion guaranies, Capasa 
for 29 billion guaranies, and LAPSA for 22 billion guaranies, 
for a total of 59 billion guaranies. 
  The Privatization Council's Executive Directorate has called 
local and international consulting firms for the preliminary 
bidding for designing the privatization strategy of each of 
those enterprises. The process includes valuation of assets and 
the preparation of the list of conditions for the call for 
offers. 
  More than 92 consulting firms have responded, and their 
proposals will be rated by the council under the control of the 
Bicameral Privatization Commission and the nation's comptroller 
general. The IDB will finance the consulting services with 
nonreimbursable credits from a Japanese donation. The first call 
for offers for privatization is scheduled for July. 
  The executive branch cooperated with the drawing up of a 
bill 
amending Privatization No. Law 126/91, with a view toward 
issuing regulations for Article 111 of the Constitution, 
assigning 10 percent of the capital of the enterprises that will 
be privatized for employees and workers and 10 percent for the 
directly involved sectors, facilitating the purchasing of shares 
under special, preferential conditions. 
  The monetary supply grew 223.5 percent compared with 1992 as 
a result of the increase in international reserves and the money 
supply's expansion, which was caused mainly by the withdrawal of 
deposits in the Social Security Institute and other state 
enterprises from the Central Bank of Paraguay. 
  Legal reserve restrictions were lifted in order to provide 
credits to farmers. In 1993, bank rediscounts dropped 47 percent 
compared with 1992. Rediscounts no longer exist. They were 
replaced by financing from the private banking system. 
  The money supply grew 20.3 percent, totaling 981 billion 
guaranies. Savings deposits grew 27.6 percent, totaling 780.809 
billion guaranies, while foreign currency deposits grew 1.2 
trillion guaranies, which is equivalent to $640 million, which 
amounts to a 53 percent increase. Banks have large dollar 
deposits for financing this year's crops. For cotton and soybean 
harvesting, banks provided credits worth 382 billion guaranies. 
  Bank loans to the government declined substantially in 
1993, as compared to the significant growth of domestic loans to 
the public sector in 1992, which was prompted by large foreign 
debt payments. 
  In February 1993 the National Treasury received from the 
Central Bank an advance of 125 billion guaranies to help the 
state pay various obligations. This amount has been largely 
reimbursed by the current administration. At this point public 
sector debts to the Central Bank total 1.2 trillion guaranies, 
while public sector deposits at the Central Bank amount to 226 
billion guaranies. 
  Bank loans to private enterprises have increased by 42 
percent. This significant increase of bank loans to private 
enterprises was prompted mostly by the cash flow generated by 
Paraguayan Social Security Institute [IPS] deposits in the local 
banks, increased deposits from other public institutions, and 
the growth of private deposits, including those in foreign 
currency. 
  The most recent figures from the National Development Bank 
[BNF], the bank that is most directly involved in the financing 
of productive activities, reveal that 343 billion guaranies have 
been loaned out. Of this amount, 70 percent went to agriculture 
and livestock, 23 percent to industry, and 7 percent to trade. 
  The National Workers Bank [BNT] is giving clear signs that 
it 
has turned into a strong corporation that is leaving its mark on 
the financial market. During the past fiscal year its net 
profits totaled 3.6 billion guaranies (an increase of 204 
percent). The balance of its loan portfolio surpasses 116 
billion guaranies (an increase of 40 percent). 
  Socially oriented loans totaling more than 27 billion 
guaranies were granted to 6,818 worker families (an increase of 
70 percent). Cooperatives were given almost 6 billion guaranies 
in loans. As part of its social project the BNT also 
contributed to the administration's agrarian policy by settling 
636 families on more than 5,000 hectares of land that belonged 
to the bank. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign accounts improved in 1993. The balance of payments 
yielded a surplus of $87 million as compared to the $347 million 
deficit in 1992, the year in which a large portion of the 
foreign debt was paid. The large foreign trade deficit was also 
reduced in 1993 due to an increase in exports, which brought in 
$729 million. 
  The balance of payments will be further strengthened in 1994 
by the growth of exports, which are expected to total $1 
billion, and by the projected inflow of foreign capital. 
  Foreign loans disbursed in 1993, mainly by international 
organizations, amounted to $115 million, thus registering a 26 
percent increase. 
  As of this year, the national government will be granted 
considerable financial support to finance rural development, 
environmental protection, the betterment of public health and 
education services, and the strengthening of other areas of 
social interest. 
  International credits for funding projects in the two-year 
period extending from 1994 to 1996, formalized and about to be 
approved, add up to $1.4845 billion. They will be earmarked as 
follows: $518.9 million for rural development, $288.8 million 
for health care and education, $54 million for housing 
development projects, $576.6 million for infrastructure (roads, 
electricity, communications, and transport), and $46.2 million 
for institutional development. 
  This important financing, together with the funds 
appropriated for these ends in the national budget, will boost 
our country's social and economic development. 
  International reserves totaled $698.4 million to 31 December 
1993, thus registering a 14.4 percent increase. 
  Our country's external debt dropped to $1.2175 billion in 
December 1993. Our debt service obligations are current, with 
the exception of some payments that are under way. 
  The underlying causes of our present problems show that it 
will be absolutely essential to reach a frank, open, and 
well-devised agreement between the private and public sectors to 
overcome the barriers that hamper domestic growth. 
  The executive branch will draft a budget that guarantees 
fiscal balance, including an efficient policy on spending and 
investments and an appropriate allocation of funds. We base 
ourselves on the presumption that discipline and monetary 
stability are the bases of macroeconomic order. 
  Permit me to remind you that to that effect we have already 
submitted to Congress bills that are very important for 
reforming and strengthening the financial system, like the 
Central Bank charter bill and the stock corporation bill, which 
by modifying the conditions for the establishment of the said 
corporations will contribute to speeding up the deregulation 
process. 
  In the course of this year's session of Congress, the 
executive branch will submit the following bills, on: banks, 
duty-free zones, mutual funds, tax reform, reforestation, 
discounting of industrial assets, insurance, petroleum and 
hydrocarbons, trust funds, leasing, and investors' by-laws. 
  The considerations put forward in the present report can be 
summarized in the following strategy: 
  On the one hand, state reform, which by doing away with the 
privileges and concessions that characterized past policies, 
will enable efficiency and the solution of our social problems. 
On the other hand, the privatization of the economy will grant 
the private sector an increasingly leading role in the 
production of goods and services. This will be made by 
furthering environmentally sound technologies that increase 
productivity and enhance the quality of life for all citizens, 
especially those in the social strata and regions that have for 
centuries been excluded from the benefits of social and economic 
development. 
<H5>  The Social Situation </H5>
  Our most difficult heritage -- all of us know this -- is 
poverty, unemployment, and educational inequality, with their 
painful burden of injustice and frustration and their harmful 
consequences of beggary and crime. 
  Ours is a small community living in a generous land, which 
is 
generous because of its size, of the quality of its soil, and 
its abundant natural resources. 
  We should have long ago become a model society living in 
well-being. Yet some essential factors of our territory still 
remain unknown to us. 
  We are still working on the preparation of maps for the 
classification and use of soils, for drainage, infrastructure, 
and zoning. 
  We are still distributing land without the basic data from a 
land survey registry, the preparation of which we are promoting, 
after awarding the respective contract through an international 
call for bids, with World Bank financing. 
  That is why I would like to reiterate before this honorable 
Congress that education is a true obsession for me. This 
obstinate idea stems from the fact that I am convinced that the 
limitations of our educational system are, beyond all doubt, the 
biggest barriers that we have to overcome in order to achieve 
development. Consequently, education is our first strategic 
choice, because we consider it a vital factor for the production 
of wealth. [passage omitted] 
  Another inherited obligation compels us to provide drinking 
water, highway infrastructure, electric power, sanitary 
services, and medical assistance to many towns. As you, Messrs. 
Deputies and Senators, know, our resources are scarce, and have 
so far been improperly allocated and improperly used, despite 
the corrective measures that we have begun to adopt. 
  I am in no way trying to sing a litany of pessimism and 
hopelessness to this honorable Congress. 
  What I did decide to do, however, is -- in keeping with 
constitutional principles -- to avoid siren songs, and to speak 
frankly about the general situation in the Republic and about 
the restrictions that we have to face, so that all of us may 
become aware of the magnitude of the commitment that we have 
assumed. [passage omitted] 
  In the labor area, the Ministry of Labor and Justice broke 
with a negative tradition of disagreement and sterile 
confrontations, beginning a new system of relations between the 
state, the employers, and workers, based on dialogue and accord, 
in search for agreements leading toward more harmonious social 
development. 
  The government's openmindedness, and the cooperation of 
employers and workers, are built upon fluid communications with 
the labor and management centrals, whose positive results are 
reflected by the following figures: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Approved Collective Contracts:        |                                      | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Between August 1992 and February 1993:|12                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Between August 1993 and February 1994:|35                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Favorable balance:                    |23                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Legalized Unions:                     |                                      | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Between August 1992 and February 1993:|58                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Between August 1993 and February 1994:|126                                   | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Favorable balance:                    |62 [as published]                     | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  It should also be noted that among the unions that were 
legalized after 15 August 1993, 65 belong to the public sector, 
thus attesting to the freedom of association prevailing in that 
sector. 
  Efficient government action in this area led the United 
States to exclude Paraguay from the list of countries that were 
sanctioned for labor violations in the General System of 
Preferences. [passage omitted] 
  The problems of the social sector, however, are not limited 
to education, health, housing and social security, which are 
obviously essential for human development. Problems in this 
area also include poverty and the most vulnerable sectors of 
society, such as women, minors, the handicapped, and indigenous 
people. 
  The concentration of economic activities in the hands of the 
state, far from promoting fair distribution of wealth and of the 
results of work, is a factor for backwardness, for concentration 
of income, and for progressive marginalization for a vast sector 
of society. This has happened in Paraguay, and it is the 
darkest and most painful side of our situation. [passage 
omitted] 
  A nation that neglects its children cannot even envisage 
its future, let alone a happy one. Our social reality is marred 
by the painful existence of street children, of unprotected and 
abandoned children. 
  Nearly 50 percent of our population is in the under 20 age 
bracket; 26,000 children and teenagers are working on the 
streets of Asuncion and in the metropolitan area; and 2 percent 
of the children living in Asuncion are in a high risk situation. 
Eighty five percent of these children attend school 
irregularly, while the remaining 15 percent do not attend school 
at all. 
  The temptation to think about adopting relief measures 
appears to be irresistible -- and we are in fact thinking about 
that. We should not deceive ourselves, however, because the 
solutions we all want will be achieved only through economic 
growth and development. 
  There are 484,189 handicapped individuals in our country. 
This figure accounts for 10 percent of our overall population. 
  Being handicapped should not be an insurmountable obstacle 
for anyone to join society and the job market. In this respect, 
the public sector has set an example by hiring handicapped 
individuals, and the private sector should do the same as long 
as these individuals also do their part in training for 
production. 
  We are giving special attention to the priority requirement 
of supplying land and the respective deeds to indigenous 
communities. 
  As we have seen, education and public health programs 
envisage special projects intended for indigenous groups so 
that, without reneging on their culture, they may be integrated 
into society with the knowledge required by any modern country. 
  To deal with these and other social problems we have 
proceeded to reorganize many institutions having jurisdiction 
over these areas. 
  Regarding the public housing program, we have appointed a 
new 
management team to overcome the financial crisis we had 
inherited. 
  I am referring to the main public institution charged with 
meeting the demands of public housing. The government has 
appointed a new administration team to overcome the financial 
crisis left by the previous one. [passage omitted] 
  Another current issue is the one concerning the Social 
Security Institute (IPS), which is being criticized by several 
sectors, including unions of IPS workers themselves. An 
investigation is currently being conducted at the IPS Central 
Hospital, and studies aimed at gathering current data are being 
made with the cooperation of the United Nations and the IDB. 
  It is expected that all this will result in profound 
structural changes and markedly improved services in the short 
term. 
  Regarding the rural situation, we may also notice that we 
are 
still experiencing problems stemming from an outdated, obsolete 
structure. We are currently experiencing conflicts in some 
areas, and are hearing strong demands from those asking for land 
and for better prices for agricultural products. 
  We are taking action. We are studying projects for 
implementing a true agrarian reform, which would not be limited 
to a simple distribution of land. We have changed both the 
leadership and the approach of the Agrarian Reform Institute. 
We have expanded technical and financial support. We 
successfully fought cotton plagues. We have applied a policy of 
dialogue and negotiations. 
  We must openly and clearly state here that the state in 
Paraguay can no longer intervene in the economy. Yes, this is a 
state that wants to play a guiding role in promoting productive 
activity and competition, which must be governed by the free 
market rules. 
  Based on these rules we will meet the challenge of 
increasing 
production and productivity to be able to enjoy comparative 
advantages regarding prices, especially regarding export 
products, but without neglecting those items intended for 
domestic consumption. 
  It is in this fashion that we will achieve progress and 
prosperity in rural areas. We will not achieve all this by 
granting subsidies, the trademark of paternalist systems, which 
will only result in maintaining old, unjust, and almost feudal 
structures for property and production, when our needs and 
aspirations for modernization call for new techniques and for 
adequately trained and well supported farmers. 
  I will not adopt demagogic measures that could perhaps bring 
short-lived euphoria, but which would ultimately have nefarious 
consequences for the entire population. 
  With great dedication, we will proceed in our endeavor to 
create the appropriate conditions for achieving the major 
objectives for the rural sector outlined in our government 
program. 
  Within the framework of complete press freedom, I ordered 
that the press be granted total access to official data and 
information. The Social Communications Secretariat has been 
clearly instructed to facilitate -- as much as possible -- the 
work of reporters. 
  It goes without saying that it behooves a government with a 
democratic vocation and above-board behavior to act in this way. 
  The press have a fundamental role in our historical process, 
and a great responsibility in times of transition, when they 
have to fulfill several tasks -- to inform the public so that we 
citizens may know what is happening in our country; to uncover 
events and situations that affect the public interest; and to 
guide public opinion with wisdom and presence of mind, which is 
perhaps the most difficult task. 
  I think that the government is doing its share. We are 
making every effort to strengthen democracy with sincerity and 
frankness. 
  The press, like all sectors, need to improve their members' 
training. And yet I do not intend to judge the work of the 
press. Time, the master of history, will judge them. 
  We have attempted to enumerate the social problems that 
weigh 
heavily on so many people. 
  The task ahead is truly arduous, as my honorable friends may 
have already noticed. 
  This task will be long and will entail much sacrifice. It 
will require a concerted effort by all of us, in acting 
resolutely to substantially modify all the restraining variables 
that we have briefly included in this address. Otherwise we 
will stagnate and will not be able to achieve development. 
  Inspired by this conviction, we established the Coordinating 
Council for Social Development by decree on 21 February 1994. 
We charged this multisectorial council to coordinate 
strategies, efforts, and wills with a view to solving social 
problems and helping the country achieve development. 
  I do not wish to close this subject on the country's social 
problems without having conveyed my heartfelt appreciation for 
all the help Paraguayan churches have given me whenever I 
requested their cooperation. 
  I have proof of the great spirit of tolerance -- a nearly 
sublime one -- that informs these pastors' actions, in the face 
of the frequent lack of understanding with which people respond 
to the self-giving and sacrifice they offer us every day. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  Our Relations With the World </H5>
  Relations between states have always been given top priority 
by every government, not because the other businesses of any 
public administration are less important, but rather because 
foreign relations by their very nature have very special 
characteristics conditioning their exercise. 
  This is why it is of paramount importance to assess every 
step to be taken in foreign policy with seriousness, common 
sense, and composure. 
  Paraguay is recovering the characteristics of a democratic 
state, which enable it to comfortably hold talks either with 
nations with which we have friendly ties or in international 
forums. The executive power, which by constitutional mandate 
has the laborious task of conducting the country's foreign 
policy, wishes to live up to this honorable duty. I will spare 
no efforts or initiative to achieve the effective insertion of 
our country onto the different stages upon which our destiny is 
at stake. 
  I attended the UN General Assembly and the OAS Permanent 
Council, to report on the Paraguayan political reality and on 
our foreign policy objectives at these important world and 
regional forums. 
  I also participated in the Rio Group Summit in Santiago, 
Chile, to discuss with the other presidents ways to tackle the 
problems confronting the vast region we belong to. 
  We are especially interested in maintaining, strengthening, 
and boosting our relation with our neighboring countries by 
furthering an uninterrupted, cordial, and highly creative 
dialogue. 
  Among the most salient bilateral issues discussed with our 
neighbors, let us mention the following: the Pilcomayo River; 
the Yacyreta and Corpus [hydroelectric dams] with Argentina; the 
enhancement of our relations with Bolivia; Itaipu [hydroelectric 
dam], the cornerstone of our relations with Brazil; the 
Paraguay-Parana Waterway; and the Tiete-Parana highway. 
  Following a virtual suspension of construction work at 
Yacyreta, the Paraguayan and Argentine Governments have decided 
to reactivate the project on the basis of the gradual filling of 
the reservoir in stages, administrative rationalization, and a 
total reassessment of its economic and financial profile. This 
has enabled the unblocking of foreign financial aid, which in 
turn will be instrumental in making the first turbine -- which 
will operate at an elevation of 76 meters above sea level -- 
operational in September this year, once we resolve aspects that 
have to do with the necessary expropriations and resettlement. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Corpus Christi [hydroelectric dam] project is well 
located geographically for supplying energy to Argentina, 
Paraguay, Uruguay, and Brazil within Mercosur, and represents a 
regional electrical energy integration axis. 
  In keeping with the trend toward the privatization of public 
enterprises, the governments of Paraguay and Argentina agreed to 
promote the Corpus project through concessions to the private 
sector. 
  The adverse results of the work carried out on the Pilcomayo 
River to control the retrogression of the river channel created 
a situation of great concern with the Argentine Republic, 
involving a total diversion of the waters toward Argentine 
territory. This situation lasted two years. 
  Busy diplomatic negotiations have been conducted to have 
this 
irregularity soon corrected. [passage omitted] 
  The Paraguayan and Argentine delegations met in Asuncion on 
29 and 30 November and on 1 December. Following busy 
negotiations and a good understanding between the two countries, 
an agreement was signed. It was agreed to pursue studies, 
projects, and work on the River Plate basin to guarantee an 
equal distribution of the waters and prevent the retrogression 
of the river. [passage omitted] 
  As part of this program provisional corrective work will be 
implemented this year. To this end, access roads and the 
infrastructure for camps and warehousing of materials are being 
built now. 
  Concerning our efforts in the international arena, I would 
like to especially emphasize one of these. I believe, 
gentlemen, that we have marked the end of a long history of 
estrangement from the Republic of Bolivia. We have definitely 
overcome the obstacles that had prevented a close relationship, 
and have also achieved a period of spiritual neighborliness. 
  Integration overcomes disruptions and divisions. Now 
Paraguay and Bolivia can develop projects of great importance 
for the two countries. The waterway, the geopolitical key to 
the River Plate, the sound and equal use of the Pilcomayo River, 
the gas pipeline, the various methods of exchange between two 
complementary economies, and the Transchaco Highway link are 
some of the issues uniting Paraguay and Bolivia within prospects 
for friendship and progress. The restoration of the Chaco War 
trophies, symbolic of this new relationship between the two 
countries, was approved by this Congress. Our relationship will 
be further enhanced with Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada's visit in a few days. 
  Concerning Itaipu Binational, my administration paid due 
attention to its financial situation during the second half of 
1992 and the first half of 1993. Itaipu Binational pledged to 
honor its obligations with the Paraguayan Government, involving 
"royalties" and compensation for the supply of energy. It is 
worth mentioning that the Itaipu royalties represent the second 
most significant source of income for the Treasury. 
  Our credit totaled about $138 million by 30 July 1993. 
Additional credits would have become due in subsequent months, 
thus aggravating Itaipu's payments crisis. 
  Special and personal negotiations were conducted before 
Brazilian authorities who, as a response and within the 
framework of mutual cooperation, allowed Itaipu to establish an 
adjusted payment schedule. Remittances to Paraguay, totaling 
about $153 million, were resumed between 16 August and December 
1993. 
  In January we collected the rescheduled debts for 1990, 
1991, 
and 1992. 
  The Paraguayan and Brazilian Governments focused their 
attention on the irregular situation of the Itaipu Binational 
administration, prompted by the refusal of our country's 
Congress to approve the statutes proposed in 1991. Through 
notes signed on 20 December the Paraguayan and Brazilian 
Governments agreed on provisionally reinstating the 1986 Statute 
(Annex A) until the High-Level Contracting Sides decide to 
implement a new Statute, whose negotiations are scheduled to 
conclude before 31 December 1995. 
  Following productive talks with the presidents of the two 
congressional chambers, bloc leaders, foreign relations 
committee chairmen, and leaders from all political parties, an 
agreement was signed. This agreement is now being discussed by 
you, and it has already received approval in one of the chambers. 
  I am resolutely in favor of integration at various levels, 
passing through all the stages that are required to achieve it 
and without being detrimental to our own interests. 
  With regard to Mercosur, during the presidential summit held 
in the city of Colonia, Uruguay, in January, I said Mercosur is 
destined to promote economic development, which will contribute 
to strengthening our democracies and achieving a balanced social 
system. 
  I also pointed out that, as practice indicates, the 
deadlines 
established in the Asuncion Treaty are too short for the 
ambitious objectives that are pursuing. 
  We have made great efforts, promoting the free traffic of 
people, goods, services, and capitals, but we still have not 
properly encouraged an economic and social convergence among the 
four countries, which have policies that are far from 
convergent, have disparate economic potentials, and must 
harmonize their macroeconomic and area policies. 
  Paraguay thus proposed creating a Solidarity Program 
[Programa de Solidaridad] that would favor the member states 
whose economies are less developed, so as to encourage a 
regional redistribution of resources and facilitate the member 
states' integration into Mercosur. 
  I also assign high priority to the "Parana-Paraguay" 
waterway, which will be extraordinary not only thanks to its 
impact on commercial traffic, but thanks to its political 
significance as a factor for strengthening the friendship among 
River Plate basin countries. 
  I assign a similar significance to the river integration 
project involving the Parana and Tiete Rivers. We fully 
appreciate and support this project. We will never repent of 
increasing the means of communications among our territories. 
For centuries we suffered retrogressive estrangement. In this 
era of high technology, it is a favorable time to regain the 
opportunities that we missed. 
  Drug trafficking: an unpleasant but unavoidable subject. 
The government has officially undertaken the commitment to 
fight, with every means it has at hand, the production and 
consumption of and trafficking in drugs and psychotropic 
substances, in all their forms. 
  The great economic power of the underworld is the main 
obstacle in the struggle against drug trafficking. 
  We will resort to our meager resources in order to fulfill 
our commitment. We hope to enjoy the cooperation of those 
countries equally engaged in fighting this scourge. 
  I will now refer to a subject that has drawn the attention 
of 
the people and members of this Congress. 
  I am talking about the "Strong Highways 94-S-PA" project, 
which was supposed to be carried out in San Pedro Department by 
U.S. servicemen together with members of the Paraguayan Public 
Works and Communications Ministry. 
  The proposal to implement this project was carefully 
assessed 
by competent Paraguayan organizations, but unfortunately it will 
not be carried out, due to lack of time in coordinating this 
project in keeping with the terms of the Constitution. The 
background on the project was submitted to the president of the 
honorable Congress. 
  As for the offer to carry out the joint military maneuvers 
"United Forces 94" and "Unitas 35," the executive branch will 
not object to their implementation under the same terms of 
previous years, and as long as the constitutional requirements 
are fulfilled. 
  We hope to continue enjoying U.S. technical cooperation and 
assistance in further training our Armed Forces. 
  As I greet the heads of foreign missions I cannot but help 
mention the support my government received, right from the 
beginning, from the entire international community and 
international organizations. 
  I want to especially mention the member countries of the 
Southern Cone, Spain, Germany, the United States, Japan, the 
United Nations, the OAS, international financial organizations, 
the IDB, the World Bank, and the IMF. Also the EEC, now the 
European Union. 
  Paraguay has a new approach regarding the rest of the world. 
We have emerged from our isolation. Despite our landlocked 
situation, we acknowledge the new map of the world and the new 
relationship among nations. 
  The executive branch seeks to maximize its relationship with 
all the countries of the world. Within this context I have made 
several trips abroad to shorten distances, recover and start 
relationships, and especially, open new prospects for our 
economy and commerce. 
  It is not only the government that must take this new 
approach. This is why every time I go abroad I am accompanied by 
delegations of legislators and representatives of the working 
class, the business sector, the church, the political parties, 
and Paraguayan society in general. 
  In very little time we have traveled thousands of 
kilometers. 
We have visited several countries. We have met with the main 
world leaders. What have we accomplished? That the world today 
has a new idea of Paraguay. 
  Messrs. Senators and Deputies: 
  This is a time for changes and for courage. 
  It is a time of challenges in a changing world, in which 
history gains speed and reorganizes the political maps, a time 
of changes in which each country must reassess its prospects, 
and open new paths toward new opportunities. 
  The current times demand that we be fully aware of the 
historic moment we are experiencing. There is no room for 
isolation, for projects undertaken alone, for arbitrary 
decisions; there is only room for discipline. These days demand 
generosity and hard work to build the great and modern Paraguay 
we seek to bequeath to our children. 
  The fatherland stands above any differences. 
  The nation stands above the conflict of ideas and different 
viewpoints of the world. Coexistence, despite our differences 
and contradictions, builds democracy and the identity that is 
expressed in a single feeling of love for Paraguay. 
  Those of us responsible for governing the fatherland are 
here 
simply through circumstance. But we must be capable of facing 
the challenges we encounter, and of building the Paraguay to 
which we aspire. 
  Messrs. Senators and Deputies: 
  You and I are both responsible for actions that, although 
they take place in different fields, must necessary complement 
each other, because the fatherland needs firm, homogeneous, and 
coherent guidelines to attain the common objectives of all 
Paraguayans. 
  Messrs. Congressmen, representatives of the Paraguayan 
people: 
  Human life is marked by mixed feelings. On the one hand a 
feeling of love for our fellow men, and on the other the 
irresistible impulse toward evil. 
  Human life is a constant battle to overcome one's own 
weaknesses and strive for success. The real masters, those who 
are even stronger than the rulers of the people -- those who 
rule over themselves -- will defeat deception and injustice. 
  I invite each and every one of you to start this struggle 
designed to control our impulses and to work united to serve our 
people. Time flies, and our needs cannot wait to be fulfilled. 
  If this attitude is always necessary, it is particularly 
necessary in the Paraguay of today. We have reached a 
crossroads: One path draws us back to the past, and the other 
leads us toward the future to which we aspire. It is up to us 
not to slip back into the past. It is up to our courage and 
good faith to advance, to advance with hope. 
  The hope of society requires calmness, rationality, 
perseverance, and the united efforts of all in order to 
materialize. Democracy represents the institutional framework 
of hope. Democracy allows us amend mistakes without having to 
go back to the starting point, but by continuing along 
institutional paths leading to the achievement of our objectives. 
  Let us not forget that peace requires order, and stems from 
the perfect balance between charity and justice. 
  Gentlemen: 
  As I greet you, I thank you for listening to me. Please 
allow me, humbly, to recall what a Catholic saint taught us: 
Let us work as if everything depended on us, and let us pray as 
if everything depended on God. Thank you.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Uruguay monitored through 3 
March. 
  The Central Bank has reported that the Uruguayan public 
sector's gross foreign debt increased $33 million, or 0.8 
percent, and that the net foreign debt dropped 4.1 percent in 
the first 11 months of 1993. The gross foreign debt was $4.1688 
billion late in November, $35 million less than late in October, 
because of a drop in the public financial sector's debt.

  [Text] Brazilian President Itamar Franco arrived at the 
Simon Bolivar international airport at 1705. He is accompanied 
by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and a group of high-ranking 
officials from his cabinet. Itamar Franco is the first head of 
state to be received by Rafael Caldera as Venezuelan president 
after taking office one month ago. Sources close to the 
Brazilian Government said the objective of a working meeting on 
Friday is to develop the economic foundations for the creation 
of a trade agreement to be known as Merconorte. Despite the 
importance of the meeting, the presidents do not plan to sign 
any agreements since the two countries already have more than 36 
agreements ranging from cultural exchanges to technical and 
trade cooperation.

<F P=106> [By Abraham Rivero Perez] </F>
  [Text] "We believe in democracy and justice." With these 
words, Defense Minister Rafael Montero Revette made it clear the 
country's pacification policy will not only guarantee the 
strengthening of the FAN [National Armed Forces], but national 
peace as well. 
  During the interpellation or "invitation," Montero Revette 
reiterated that as long as military members are under arrest, 
problems in the FAN will continue, because the expectations of 
the public "will be voiced with greater intensity." 
  He told deputies of the Defense Commission that the solution 
to the problem of the "coupist military" is a matter of time and 
that only the investigation of each and every case will permit 
deciding "whether or not they should remain in the Armed Forces." 
  He recalled that the military institution "is an honorable 
institution, which does not have preferences for anyone, is 
apolitical, and adheres to the principles of discipline." In 
that sense, he said that those military members who were 
acquitted but were found to have been linked to the movement led 
by Commander Chavez should not be reintegrated to the FAN, 
because their statements are political." 
  He said, however that "nobody has obliged the arrested 
military members to request discharge and it cannot be said 
either that the 270 military members who were reintegrated have 
been victims of internal pressure." He said all reintegrated 
officials are obliged to do their duty and that the High Command 
is aware that it must avoid "politics in the garrisons." 
  Regarding the legal situation of Commander Chavez, he said 
that "he is an officer as any other waiting for the outcome of a 
decision. He has said he wants to leave last, and he is 
respected for that." 
  "The FAN and the government do not fear a coup d'etat. What 
we are doing is studying each case, because each officer is a 
different case. What happens is that some persons believe since 
it was a military topic involving officers that we are speaking 
of a coup," Montero Revette explained. 
  Asked if former Minister Radames Munoz Leon had tried to 
stage a military coup weeks before the December elections, 
Montero Revette said the FAN could not stage a military coup 
"because there is no man capable of communicating with all the 
officers and troops deployed throughout the national territory." 
  As for rumors that Munoz Leon had traveled to the United 
States to conspire against democracy, Montero Revette said the 
former minister was granted a leave of absence with the 
president's authorization in response to an invitation by a U.S. 
university. "I can also guarantee that the cost of the former 
minister's trip was not financed. Rather, it was financed and 
paid by the Defense Ministry. I don't know if there was support 
from another party, but that is not my problem," he stated.

  [Text] The Council of Ministers approved creation of the 
Fiscal Police and a 105-billion bolivares budget reduction today. 
  [Reporter Cecilia Pachano] During the almost five hour 
cabinet meeting, the ministers discussed at length the package 
of fiscal laws known as the Sosa Plan, although the topic was 
not exhausted. They believe the package will be finally approved 
this weekend during an extraordinary Council of Ministers 
meeting. To make this possible, the economic cabinet declared 
this an emergency and will continue to refine the laws so they 
can be ready before 8 March, the date on which the executive 
insists it will formally submit them to Congress. Progress was 
made on other matters, however. The ministers approved a decree 
that cuts spending to a level close to the 10-percent goal the 
government set. Most affected by the reduction are the 
Transportation and Communications Ministry, with a cut of 30 
billion bolivares, the Interior Ministry, with 12 billion 
bolivares, the Agriculture and Livestock Ministry, with 10 
billion bolivares, and the Defense Ministry with 6 billion. 
  Another result of the cabinet meeting was approval of the 
decree creating the National Tax Management and Control Service 
[Servicio Nacional de Administracion and Control Tributario], a 
self-financing body without the legal authority [personalidad 
juridica] to replace the General Income Directorate, which is to 
be known by the name of Fiscal Police [Policia Fiscal]. 
  [Begin Guillermo Alvarez, Central Information Office 
minister, recording] It will direct and administer tax 
activities, participate in the drafting of tax policies and 
issue guidelines to implement them, participate in studying and 
drafting bills, act as the authority that establishes tax 
policies and explains and enforces fiscal legislation, have the 
authority to collect taxes, and ensure sufficient taxes are 
collected. There is no budget allocation for this body; it will 
be self-supporting through the product of its own operations, 
and that is why it is called an autonomous service. [end 
recording] 
  Also approved during the Council of Ministers meeting was a 
decree maintaining a freeze on medicine prices, and the 
ministers ordered a revamping of the Energy and Mines Ministry. 
  [Begin Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Jose Arrieta 
recording] The purpose of this revamping is to adapt and 
modernize this ministry in line with the country's current 
mining and energy situation, so we can have a policy on mining 
and oil, as well as a large-scale mining activity. For that 
purpose, the ministry's structure will be appropriate for that 
challenge. [end recording] 
  [Pachano] The Council of Ministers also approved a decree 
reactivating the National Border Council, which will be 
installed formally on 8 March.

<F P=106> [Report by Armando J. Pernia] </F>
  [Text] Last night in its first debate, the Senate 
unanimously approved the Emergency Law on the financial system. 
The Senate Finance Commission, however, is studying a number of 
modifications to the bill to eliminate several unconstitutional 
angles. According to Senator Haydee Castillo, modifications will 
be to made to Article 5 because the [General Bank] 
Superintendency cannot prohibit the transfer of properties, 
instead it must ask a judge to prohibit it. There will also be 
changes to Article 8 so the assistance preferential rates 
principle, strongly opposed by Radical Cause and MAS [Movement 
toward Socialism], can be established. 
  The Senate also proposed extending the deadline for the 
delivery of Central Bank of Venezuela credits and Deposit 
Guarantee Fund assistance to financial institutions to three 
years. The other modification would require bank directors as 
well as auditors in any financial organization to present a 
sworn statement of their assets. 
  Senator Orlando Fernandez announced that the accounting 
subcommission had agreed to summon all Banco Latino directors 
since 1992 for questioning. They have already scheduled Ricardo 
Cisneros, Giacomo Leon, and Fernando Laurio to appear at noon 
next Tuesday. Apparently, Leon and Cisneros are in Venezuela but 
Lauria is abroad. Parliamentary sources, however, emphasized 
that the possibility of Cisneros or Leon attending the meeting 
are very slim. Haydee Castillo said the parliamentary summons 
will be sent out this week. 
  MAS Senator Orlando Fernandez reported that financial 
sectors 
are exerting pressure to see that the freedom on bail benefit 
and the compulsory sworn assets statements are eliminated from 
the law, on the argument they are "unconstitutional." 
Furthermore, Senator Jose Lira claimed the Italo Bank is about 
to "get its hands on" the Sociedad Financiera Latino through a 
stock transfer operation. According to Fernandez, the alleged 
embezzlement of Banco Latino trust funds amounts to 30 billion 
bolivares.

<F P=106> [Report by Niurka Franco] </F>
  [Text] The financial crisis Venezuela is experiencing, 
which has worsened with the recent government intervention of 
Banco Latino, has resulted from various factors, among the most 
noteworthy of which are commercial banks' unproductive assets, 
which are somewhere on the order of 251 billion bolivares and 
represent 180 percent of commercial banks' net worth of 136 
billion bolivares. 
  Judging by a careful analysis by Senator Alberto Lizardi, 
former president of the Federation of Venezuelan Public 
Accountant Associations [Federacion de Colegios de Contadores 
Publicos de Venezuela] and president of the Iberoamerican 
Confederation of Public Accountants, 66 percent of the country's 
commercial banks are facing serious financial and economic 
problems. It is a situation that, in his opinion, merits an 
exhaustive government study by Congress, depositors, and even 
the General Bank Superintendency, which, in his opinion, is 
overlooking its real duties. 
  "The General Bank Superintendency has become a conceptual 
organization that does not supervise, make recommendations, or 
intervene in any institution until it collapses." 
  Lizardi has said the 251 billion bolivares of unproductive 
assets are costing the financial sector 150 billion bolivares, 
and they have become a decisive factor in preventing commercial 
banks from providing benefits. After reading a bulletin issued 
by the General Bank Superintendency in September 1993, I am 
convinced, Lizardi has said, neither the government, state, 
General Bank Superintendency nor Central Bank of Venezuela are 
aware of the scope of the crisis, because a parallel banking 
system is in operation and the Venezuelan authorities are 
looking the other way. This parallel system has between 500 and 
800 billion bolivares at its receiving offices [mesas de 
dinero], and no one knows where those resources from the general 
public, industrial organizations, merchants and small depositors 
are invested. 
  The bank superintendent confirmed this fact when he said he 
will begin to receive information on this in May. 
  Lizardi has said it is incredible banks do not publish their 
consolidated balances and the financial statements that reflect 
the operations of their main headquarters and branches, thereby 
keeping the public abreast of the operations conducted by the 
entire economic group and its real situation, including its 
offices abroad. 
  In the specific case of receiving office operations, Lizardi 
says a failure to enter such operations as well as "offshore" 
[previous word in English] deals has led to the evasion of 
income taxes on an interest differential of approximately six 
points for funds invested and funds received. 
  Invested funds amounted to 68.83 percent and received funds 
to 62.31 percent on 31 December 1993. 
  According to the Lizardi report, the state loses 
approximately 6.492 billion bolivares in income taxes yearly. 
It lost this much from receiving office operations last year 
alone." [no opening quotation mark as published] 
  Asked about the emergency law undergoing debate in Congress, 
Lizardi has said even though it is an important tool it will not 
resolve the crisis of the financial sector, which can only be 
resolved by applying true regulatory mechanisms. 
  "We must begin regulating banks; there must be an effective 
superintendency, and independent bank auditors must be replaced 
every two (?years) [periodos], not every 14 as in the Banco 
Latino case. Regulations such as these were implemented in the 
United States when several savings and loan institutions 
collectively went bankrupt; it is a means of conducting a purge." 
  Lizardi takes a positive view of a joint effort in which the 
executive and legislative branches, General Bank Superintendency 
and all the sectors involved will work together to achieve 
permanent and not temporary solutions.

  [Text] According to government sources, the existence of 
the price control decree, which expires on 28 February, and the 
inclusion of new products on the basic staple list are some of 
the measures the government will implement within the framework 
of the suspension of economic guarantees established in Article 
96 of the Constitution. 
  Meanwhile Fernando Egana, deputy minister of the secretariat 
of the presidency, said "the government hopes the local 
community's many sectors and especially the business sector will 
exercise common sense and a sense of responsibility and support 
the measure implemented by the government, which is aimed at 
inspiring greater security and confidence in the country's 
economic recovery." 
  The deputy minister added that the decision to suspend 
economic guarantees is not "one of ideology but of practicality, 
given the serious economic and financial circumstances the 
country is experiencing. It is the Executive Branch's duty to 
deal with the situation and to take safe and prompt action." 
  The business sector's negative reaction contrasts with the 
reaction of the consumers because, according to the government 
spokesman, "the measure has been very well received by the 
Venezuelan people in general, who hope the government will act 
responsibly and look after the people's interests, especially 
those involving the VAT [Value Added Tax], which is an unfair 
and regressive tax." This opinion was supported by a poll 
conducted by the official news agency VENPRES. 
  Egana likewise denied that foreign investors may be affected 
by the new measures, going on the assumption that to provide 
security in this area, in the midst of the difficult situation 
the country is experiencing, "the government must have 
extraordinary powers." 
  Regarding the duration of the suspension of economic 
guarantees, Egana warned that it will be restored "as soon as 
possible" after economic recovery is achieved. Meanwhile, 
President [Caldera] stressed during his speech on the 20th 
anniversary of the National Experimental University of Tachira, 
that the government will send to Congress a tax reform bill 
whereby the VAT will be replaced with a tax on luxury items, 
income taxes will be increased, and taxes will be imposed on 
"certain wholesale transactions." 
  Regarding the financial system's precarious condition, 
President Caldera has warned that "at present, through the 
Finance Ministry and other presidency offices, we are 
maintaining a very fluid relationship with the commissions that 
are working on the subject so that the situation created by the 
Banco Latino crisis and the threats on the financial system may 
be resolved harmoniously with the cooperation of various 
branches of government."

  [Text] Mexico City, 1 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Reports revealed 
today that two months after the implementation of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement "results are satisfactory" since 
almost all textile exports from Mexico to the United States have 
complied with the place of origin regulations. 
  Pedro Noyola Nolasco, Mexican foreign trade undersecretary, 
noted that NAFTA's successful implementation has resulted in 
large commercial flows, increased exports, and the strengthening 
of the Mexican textile and manufacturing sectors. Interviewed 
within the framework of the 10th meeting of the Mexican-Canadian 
Ministerial Commission, Noyola said that the customs problems 
NAFTA faced at the beginning have been resolved satisfactorily. 
  Regarding Chile's integration into NAFTA, Noyola said that 
no 
specific date exists but Chile is a good candidate and that 
according to the admission clause its incorporation is feasible. 
Noyola stated that although there are no negotiations in this 
regard yet, the three signatories (Mexico, the United States, 
and Canada) have expressed their interest for Chile as well as 
other countries from the area to join NAFTA. He recalled that 
Mexico was the one to propose the admission clause in NAFTA, 
arguing that it constitutes a mechanism that strengthens 
international trade and helps create an open area instead of a 
closed fortress that restricts commercial growth. 
  Noyola added that agreements of this type and the one that 
is 
expected to be signed by the G-3 [Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela] 
have the greatest possibilities of promoting global trade and 
are more efficient than other former agreements such as the 
Latin American Integration Association, which did not help 
Mexico to broaden trade with the region. Noyola went on to say 
that negotiations among ministers to sign the G-3 trade 
agreement "have concluded." Therefore, the technical groups are 
only working on the final details. He disclosed that from these 
last meetings a final document will be issued to clearly 
establish the chapters regarding the place of origin and 
protection regulations. However, he denied that there is 
currently a specific date to sign and initiate the commercial 
agreement with the G-3. 
  Noyola announced that on 2 March Trade Secretary Jaime Serra 
Puche will travel to Costa Rica to meet with his counterpart 
Roberto Rojas and conclude NAFTA negotiations.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 4 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan 
Foreign Trade Minister Eduardo Gonzalez said the free trade 
treaty that Costa Rica and Mexico will sign in April will serve 
as an example and as a foundation for negotiations by the 
Central American Northern Triangle, formed by Guatemala, El 
Salvador, and Honduras. 
  The Guatemalan official told ACAN-EFE that the Mexican-Costa 
Rican agreement is "positive" and added that "we have been 
closely following the process that Costa Rica was carrying out 
with Mexico." Nevertheless, he said Guatemala has decided along 
with Honduras and El Salvador, which form the so-called CA-3 
[Central America-3] group, to jointly negotiate an economic 
agreement with Mexico. "The agreement between Costa Rica and 
Mexico will serve as an example and a foundation for the 
negotiations" that will be held with the Mexican authorities, he 
said. Gonzalez announced that the CA-3 technical groups will 
meet in El Salvador on 7 and 8 March to continue analyzing a 
joint mechanism for an economic complementation agreement with 
Mexico, which jointly with the United States and Canada forms 
the world's biggest economic bloc. 
  Ministers of the three Central American countries are 
scheduled to meet with their Mexican counterpart, Herminio 
Blanco [name as received], on 11 March to analyze the marketing 
obstacles that some products of the region have in Mexico. 
  Gonzalez said efforts will be made to have the closer trade 
ties with Mexico lead to Central America's integration into the 
NAFTA.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 3 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Official sources 
disclosed that the Central American Parliament (Parlacen) today 
endorsed the adoption of a human rights ombudsman position in 
order to protect the individual rights of the regions' more than 
30 million inhabitants. 
  The project was promoted by Guatemalan Deputy Juan Ayerdi 
Aguilar and is part of the recommendations emanating from the 
August 1993 First Human Rights Seminar organized by the 
respective Parlacen commission in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Human 
rights ombudsmen representing each of the Parlacen member 
countries participated in the seminar. 
  The new ombudsman will be a Parlacen commissioner who will 
have to observe the political constitutions of each member 
state, the universal declaration of human rights, as well as 
treaties and agreements signed between the regions' governments. 
The ombudsman will also have his own legal status and will be 
independent from any human rights organization, institution, or 
official but will respect the jurisdiction of the other 
countries human rights ombudsmen. 
  Ayerdi Aguilar explained that any candidate who seeks to 
occupy the position must be a lawyer with at least five years 
professional experience as well as a citizen of one of the 
Parlacen member countries. The ombudsman will enjoy the same 
prerogatives and immunities as Parlacen deputies. 
  The position is not open to public sector workers, national 
congress or Parlacen deputies, or leaders of political parties, 
workers unions, or business associations. Neither will the 
position be open to persons who are ministers of any religious 
denomination. In addition, the person selected will be barred 
from participating in his profession during his term as 
ombudsman. 
  The candidate will be selected by the full Parlacen Assembly 
with a favorable vote of at least two-thirds of the total number 
of deputies. In addition, the candidate's nationality will be 
determined in accordance with the order in which the presidents 
were elected to the regional forum. For that reason, the first 
ombudsman will be a Guatemalan national since Roberto Nicolle 
Carpio, who first presided over the Parlacen, originates from 
Guatemala. 
  The human rights ombudsman will hold the position for three 
years and will not be eligible for reelection. 
  Ayerdi explained that there will also be a deputy ombudsman 
who will substitute for the official ombudsman in case of 
temporary absence. The selection of an assistant ombudsman will 
follow the same procedure as those established to select the 
regular ombudsman.

  [Text] In Barcelona, President Carlos Menem yesterday 
blamed "Marxists, ultraleftists, and All for the Fatherland 
[MTP] activists" for having caused the violent incidents in 
Plaza de Mayo on 2 March. 
  In remarks to Radio Mitre, Menem said: "They are cowards and 
scoundrels, who do not know how to behave themselves under a 
democracy. It is not worth bothering with these criminals." 
  In the afternoon of 2 March a group of people joining a 
retirees' march stoned the government house. Afterwards the 
police responded, and various people who had not thrown any 
stones were also involved in the repression. 
  The president again discussed this issue at the end of a 
reception hosted by Barcelona Mayor Pascual Maragall. A large 
group of Argentines living in the Catalan city participated in 
the reception. Menem stressed: "The square was full of red 
flags." 
  Asked how he received this information, Menem responded: "I 
received it from Buenos Aires." 
  Even before he arrived at the Barcelona (municipal) city 
hall, the president disclosed that he "had reports" that "groups 
interested" in disrupting public order were involved in the 
Plaza de Mayo incidents. He enumerated them: "Leaders, [Grand 
Front Deputy Carlos] "Chacho" Alvarez, [Radical Civic Union 
Senator] (Fernando) de la Rua, the MTP, the Workers Party..." 
  In Buenos Aires, however, Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf 
preferred to wait for the courts to decide. He said: "After 
all I have suffered, I do not want to imitate McCarthy." 
Ruckauf added: "I will not single out anyone politically until 
a judge hands down the appropriate ruling and it becomes known 
who, according to the courts, is guilty and who is innocent." 
  Radical Civic Union [UCR] President Raul Alfonsin could not 
restrain his annoyance over what he described a 
"disproportionate police action." 
  The former president also expressed his solidarity with the 
retirees. In his opinion, the 100th retirees' march became "a 
protest demonstration by all the sectors that are enduring the 
callousness of an economic policy that does not take the people 
into account." 
  Senator Fernando de la Rua, his opponent in the UCR 
primaries, was not as critical. De la Rua told journalist 
Bernardo Neustadt: "A group of activists who caused the disorder 
appeared, and then came the police repression." De la Rua made 
it clear that he did not participate in the retirees' march. 
  For his part, Raul Galvan, the UCR bloc leader in the 
Chamber 
of Deputies, announced that his party would ask for the interior 
minister's interpellation "to explain why the police made 
indiscriminate repressions." 
  Speaking for the center-left, [Grand Front] Deputy Graciela 
Fernandez Meijide stressed: "Those who stoned the police must 
be criticized, condemned, and repudiated. I believe these 
people were not supporting the retirees." Nevertheless, the 
Grand Front legislator said: "The police, who brutally beat the 
people, must also be repudiated."

  [Text] The fourth contingent of Argentine 5th Army 
Battalion (BEA 5) personnel left for Croatia on 3 March from 
Ezeiza International Airport. The Argentine soldiers will join 
UN troops that are monitoring the cease-fire in Croatia. 
  The latest Argentine contingent will replace the 4th BEA 
detachment which has been carrying out its UN mission in Croatia 
for six months. 
  Relatives and Army officers said farewell to close to 150 
officers and noncommissioned officers at a ceremony held at 
Ezeiza International Airport. Division General Raul Gomez 
Sabaini, deputy chief of staff of the Army, presided over the 
ceremony. 
  The Argentine soldiers will arrive in Zagreb, the capital of 
Croatia, at 1100 Argentine time [1400 GMT] on 5 March. Their 
flight will make technical stopovers in Recife (Brazil) and Las 
Palmas, Canary Islands. 
  BEA 5 has 901 men and three women. Its commander is 
Lieutenant Colonel Domingo Justo Machado. The battalion will 
help enforce UN resolutions. 
  The United Nations has had to take action in Croatia 
(Western 
Slovenia of the former Yugoslavia) [as published] after the 
country fell apart due to serious domestic conflicts prompted by 
political, religious, and racial motives. 
  The mission of Argentine troops is to monitor the 
cease-fire, 
set up observation posts, patrol specific areas, help the 
civilian population, oversee exchanges of prisoners, supervise 
the refugees, and clear minefields. Each operational contingent 
will stay in Croatia for six months. Of all UN "blue helmets" 
operations throughout the world, the one in Croatia involves the 
largest number of troops.

<F P=106> [By Rosa Maria Godoy] </F>
  [Text] Greetings to all listeners of this program. Working 
under the sun and at the seashore, challenging and transforming 
nature, the men here are placing rock upon rock to build the 
road that will link one piece of land with another. These 
builders are grouped within the Las Villas Campaign contingent, 
the goal of which is to complete the rock-fill embankments that 
will link Caibarien with the northern villages. I met them while 
participating in the contingent's parliament. Pedro Ross Leal, 
secretary general of the Cuban Workers' Federation, also 
attended this parliament. 
  Unlike the other contingents we visited, the workers here 
did 
not talk about difficulties, lack of fulfillment, inaction, 
inefficiencies, or other irregularities. These men of legend, as 
Ross Leal described them, proudly outlined their achievements: 
the 41,358 meters of embankment they completed, the 24 bridges 
they built, the low production-cost rate, and the low accident 
rate, among others, which are victories of our history. 
  They also told us about their ingeniousness to save and 
protect the scarce raw material, as in the case of the 18-gauge 
wire that is used to tie the rods [cabillas]. This wire was 
replaced by steel belts taken from discarded tires. And the 24 
bridges were built with wood models which were used from 
beginning to end. 
  The Las Villas Campaign contingent has only 7 km left, to 
complete the rock-fill embankment from the northern part of 
Villa Clara to Caibarien. Our daily deeds and achievements are 
recorded all along that white rock-fill strip in the middle of 
the sea. At the parliaments, those workers from Villa Clara have 
reaffirmed their willingness to keep building efficiently, with 
the same quality that has always characterized them. These 
projects are sponsored by several organizations. 
  Concerning the country's internal finances, the members of 
the Las Villas Campaign contingent defended the liberalization 
and increases in alcoholic beverage and cigarette prices, 
maintenance of the revolutionary achievements such as public 
health and education, and the payment of some gratuities. 
  [Begin recording of unidentified speaker] In fact, since 
1959, through the first article of the Constitution, the 
Revolution has provided for man's full identity. This was also 
one of the first things I discussed with Marti [not further 
identified]. The government has been subsidizing a large number 
of products for the people, and I think the time has come for us 
workers to make some sacrifice. Let us begin by admitting that 
in order to guarantee the continuation of the free education and 
health programs given to us, the state to a certain extent needs 
to collect something in order to maintain those services. These 
services require much money. 
  For instance, I was watching television the past few days, 
and I think that 99.9 percent of us watch that television 
series. How many people are watching that series? Imagine how 
much could be collected if each Cuban had to pay no more than 
one peso for watching such shows. Or perhaps we could pay in 
accordance with the quality of the show. If the show is of 
lesser quality, then we should pay a little less. But why should 
we be reluctant to pay for something we enjoy watching, 
something the people enjoy watching? Why should we reject the 
idea of accruing a given amount of money to be self-sufficient 
in sports in this country, for instance, because the state has 
been fully financing this. 
  There are other aspects: water, for instance. All Cubans are 
now receiving water free of charge. We are not thinking of 
installing meters at this moment because it would be a rather 
complex situation. But we could establish a fixed monthly 
payment for water, and that would also provide some income for 
the state. 
  Electricity is another aspect that requires more attention. 
It consumes much fuel, which also has a high cost. We must 
increase the per-kilowatt cost of electricity because that would 
also create the habit of conserving electricity among the 
people. We must make a sacrifice. And whom are we going to ask 
to make sacrifice but the revolutionary workers. For this 
reason, we believe that all aspects that are subsidized by the 
state must be thoroughly analyzed and to the extent possible, 
increased in price to prevent further subsidies. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Granma Province is already reaching yields of 
5,000 quintals of potatoes per area [as heard]. Meanwhile, in 
Matanzas Province it will be impossible to reach the expected 1 
million quintals during the present season due to the plague 
that affects the crops. 
  These potato plantations are affected by the phytopdae 
[fitoptera], a fungus commonly known as late blight. Its 
appearance and rapid propagation is associated with weather 
conditions, temperature, and humidity, which are ideal for its 
development. The strict sanitary control of the crops allowed 
its rapid detection and the design of a program to minimize its 
effect. [passage omitted] 
  A great amount of resources is being used against the 
plague. 
They have applied tonnes of imported chemical products by crop 
dusting. The effort of the men and women has been decisive. 
Nevertheless, effects on the crops have already been seen, but 
the effects can only be evaluated once the season concludes. 
  Politburo member Yadira Garcia, first secretary of the 
Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Matanzas Province, toured the 
potato producing fields of Jovellanos Municipality accompanied 
by officials and specialists of the Ministry of Agriculture 
[Minag]. Angel Berriel, delegate of the Minag in Matanzas, 
reported that so far the majority of the crops have been 
affected: 23 caballerias severely affected, and 12 completely 
defoliated. In the midst of well-known economic limitations, the 
country's leadership has assigned the necessary resources to 
confront the situation. There has been a recovery in areas which 
were severely affected, and the harvest in those areas is 
promising. 
  Part of the strategy consists in optimizing the harvest as 
never before, making sure that not one potato is left in the 
fields. That has been the instruction given by the PCC. 
  [Begin Garcia recording] During the harvest, we must strive 
to do the best to ensure a good harvest. It must be a quality 
harvest. There are always challenges. That is something that is 
inevitable with the potato crops. Despite this we must work in 
the harvest with the dedication of all forces of each 
municipality, which is what we are doing now with the beginning 
of the harvest. We are giving a positive answer to the problem. 
[end recording] 
  It has been said that regarding agriculture, nature imposes 
its laws. But the dedication and the intelligence of men and 
women also has its effect. It will now be impossible for 
Matanzas to reach the 1 million quintals of potatoes. The 
phytopdea has affected the yields but has increased the effort 
and the desire to reach and exceed the goal of 750,000 quintals. 
The battle has just begun.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia </F>
and guest Renato Recio from TRABAJADORES, and Osvaldo Rodriguez 
from JUVENTUD REBELDE -- live] 
  [Text] [Roque] Good afternoon, this program could not 
ignore Cuba's presentation of a document by the U.S. Interests 
Section [USINT] in Havana to the UN Human Rights Commission in 
Geneva on the so-called human rights group in Cuba. You know the 
background. The information has been reported by the media. 
Today we will discuss this. 
  [Recio] It is, first of all, one more confirmation that the 
U.S. policy toward Cuba on this much-haggled issue of human 
rights is based above all on a fallacy. It is founded, above 
all, on a fictional script that they wish to impose on Cuba to 
continue a policy of maintaining the blockade and doing 
everything possible to prevent the Cuban people from fulfilling 
its dream of sovereignty and independence. 
  This case seems to come straight from the movies. It smells 
of the movies. Friendly hands have given Cuba a document which 
proves that SINA [USINT] has sent a letter to the State 
Department, the CIA -- listen closely now -- the CIA [repeats], 
and the Immigration and Naturalization Service clearly 
acknowledging that in Cuba there is really no evidence of human 
rights violations and that those who request U.S. refugee 
program protection must invent stories to prove that they are 
objects of persecution by Cuban authorities or have been victims 
of human rights violations. 
  [Rodriguez] I also believe it is good to point out something 
I was reading in a news agency dispatch that confirms the ties 
between these groups, these minuscule groups as we Cubans call 
them, and the CIA, and how -- through USINT in Havana -- these 
groups are encouraged, financed, and promoted. Recently, thanks 
to my journalistic work, I had an opportunity to meet with 
several members of one of these small groups. I pointed out to 
them in my conversation that they are puppets of Yankee 
diplomacy because they had also told me they have free access to 
USINT. Every member of these groups, or at least their leaders, 
have free access to USINT. What they are truly seeking is the 
establishment of a biographical record in order to eventually 
emigrate to the United States. 
  [Roque] The document itself is entitled: Actual Situation of 
the Cuban Refugee Program. The document states that the visa 
request process keeps encountering dubious cases mostly provoked 
by economics. I believe we must comment on this because that is 
the way it is. 
  [Rodriguez] That is very interesting because the 
international campaign the United States wages against Cuba is 
precisely that the emigration of a significant number of Cubans 
to the United Stated is rooted in politics. However, Cuba has 
always maintained that those leaving do so above all for 
economic reasons. There is a difference between emigres and 
refugees. It seems completely normal for Cubans here to admit 
that they emigrate for economic reasons. However, the United 
States maintains that they are not emigrants, but refugees, or 
dissidents, or persecuted, etc. 
  This document proves... [changes thought] They acknowledge: 
We cannot find a way to prove that there are cases of human 
rights violations. What we actually find is that people ask to 
leave Cuba for economic reasons. This is very important. 
  [Recio] I believe this proves once again that those Cubans 
who wish to move to the United States are held hostage to that 
policy. I believe this has been a habit of U.S. policy since the 
beginning of the Revolution. 
  [Roque] You spoke earlier of fallacies. In this case, I 
believe that the entire U.S. policy toward Cuba is full of 
fallacies, from beginning to end. Today we are talking about new 
evidence of the fallacy of U.S. policy toward Cuba based on the 
document which USINT sent to the U.S. State Department, the CIA, 
and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. As mentioned 
earlier, friendly hands delivered this USINT document to Cuban 
authorities. 
  [Rodriguez] I would like to reevaluate this. We describe 
that policy as fallacious. However, I consider that adjective 
very mild because we are speaking of infamy. We are speaking of 
complete infamy because Cuba is accused, and has always been 
accused, of violating human rights. They want to place Cuba, in 
comparative terms, in a category with those places in the world 
where great human rights violations occur. 
  It is truly offensive to be placed in this position, for 
them 
to accuse a country which, like any other, has made mistakes; 
but something that has never occurred in this country is 
continuous, massive violations of human rights, as a policy. 
Rather, the contrary is true. We can say this because the people 
know this better than anyone. They are witnesses that in Cuba no 
one is persecuted, tortured, or missing; no one in Cuba is a 
victim of police repression. 
  Everyday, you can turn on the television and see how police 
organizations around the world massively violate human rights. 
You do not see this in Cuba. Nevertheless, the United States not 
only uses this argument against Cuba, they fabricate 
circumstances. Be aware that these groups, or so-called human 
rights activists, had been receiving privileges from, were 
living off, the USINT. They even had what we call here in Cuba 
that purpose [esa busca]. But not anymore. 
  According to this document, they are even selling fraudulent 
claims. Through these sales, they are providing individuals with 
fraudulent human rights claims so they can present themselves 
for visas. 
  [Roque] Renato, I believe we could even quote that paragraph 
of the USINT document addressed to the U.S. State Department, 
the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service that reads: Over the past months, 
accusations of fraudulent requests by activists and [words 
indistinct] testimonials by human rights leaders have been 
persistent. Due to the lack of documented and verifiable proof, 
as a rule, USINT officials and members of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service consider cases on human rights most 
liable to fraud. 
  [Recio] Juan Carlos, I believe it is important to reiterate 
this about the CIA: Remember that just a few months ago, the CIA 
disclosed or acknowledged for the first time ever that it had 
conducted several attempts against Cuban leaders, especially 
against the commander in chief. In other words, they publicly 
admitted that they have been behind the policy of trying to do 
away with the Cuban Revolution and making it disappear. 
  Once again, the CIA appears here as an element that unites 
these groups that we could call Cuban opposition -- as they call 
it abroad, or as they present themselves abroad. Once again, the 
CIA uses various methods, but these so-called stupid children 
[hijitos bobos] have not been what they expected, have not been 
everything they thought they could be. I noticed that in the 
document, they made reference to 225 cases analyzed by U.S. 
officials. Of course, I am talking about the original document. 
The secret document that we were talking about was disseminated 
by the international press agencies. 
  Of these 225 cases, they say that 47 claim to have carried 
out human rights activities. Nevertheless, only 19 of them were 
finally approved by the USINT. By this you can see that there is 
a generalized fraud behind this. They were taught to commit 
fraud. The CIA, which is unquestionably behind all these 
activities, was showing them ways to commit fraud. 
  [Roque] I believe we have left out one important factor: the 
special rapporteur. 
  [Recio] Juan Carlos, that is precisely why Cuba viewed the 
report presented by this so-called UN special rapporteur at the 
UN Human Rights Commission as interference because as all of 
you, and all the listeners may remember, Cuba never admitted the 
physical presence of that individual into our country. This man 
has been able to fabricate a report that adheres to the U.S. 
policy toward Cuba that has to do with the brutal efforts and 
brutal pressure the United States exercises to make the UN 
condemn Cuba. This document we have spoken about, its discovery 
-- in quotation marks -- or its appearance undoubtedly weakens 
the U.S. intention to harm Cuba. 
  This demonstrates, once again, that Cuba does not even 
remotely violate human rights and that the United States is the 
main violator of human rights in Cuba; above all, by its 
persistence and the feats or brutality with which it imposes an 
economic blockade on the Cuban people. That is a form of 
harassment. As a matter of fact, this rapporteur includes 
recommendations in his report that to prevent the violation of 
human rights in Cuba, the blockade be lifted. Of course, it is a 
politicized way of seeing the problem. 
  [Rodriguez] Renato, I have no doubt that the speech 
presented 
by the Swedish rapporteur was drafted and written and given to 
him to be read in Geneva by the CIA in the United States. He is 
working with a set standard that is being sponsored by the U.S. 
policy, and which has its actors.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 25 February and 4 
March. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 0100 GMT on 26 February reports that 
the Baracoa Cacao Experimental Station has produced 2.5 million 
hybrid cacao seeds over the past 3 years -- a feat that has 
positive effects on Cuba's cacao situation. The seeds were 
planted on 62 caballerias in Guantanamo and on smaller areas in 
Santiago de Cuba, Holguin, and Granma Provinces. The station's 
goal this year is to produce over 1 million such seeds. By using 
these seeds, it is possible to have plants in 4 months, as 
opposed to 1 year using another method, and the resulting plants 
are much more productive, with higher yields and greater 
resistance to diseases and pests. Some of the hybrid seeds that 
will be produced by the experimental station this year will be 
distributed to other provinces; in Guantanamo, they will be used 
to plant 17 caballerias, replant another 79, and supply a 
portion of the seedlings that will be necessary the following 
year. 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 28 February reports that "the 
first Cuban firm to specialize in tourism by road has just made 
its official debut in Havana Province, under the name Tropitur." 
The firm began operations on 16 October 1993 and intends, in a 
first phase, to provide cafeteria and bar service and sell 
flowers and souvenirs on two roads frequently traveled by 
foreign tourists, the national highway and the Via Blanca, which 
link important tourist hubs. Tropitur has four units: El Cayuelo 
and Habana-Club in Santa Cruz del Norte, the Los Morales farm in 
Nueva Paz, and the (Copei) in Madruga. 
  Radio Reloj at 1509 GMT on 28 February reports that the 
nation's 1993 laboratory animal needs were fully met by the 
National Center for the Production of Laboratory Animals, 
located in Havana. Millions of dollars worth of imports were 
thus avoided. "Because of the center's high productivity and 
quality, it was also possible to export a number of animals to 
Latin America, as well as to make all the concentrated feed for 
the animals." 
  Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 1 March reports that the sale 
of 
construction materials such as cement, ceramics, and marble 
brought in $14 million in 1993; in this connection, the 
Transportation Ministry made $3.5 million in transportation fees. 
  In the same newscast, Rebelde notes that Cubana de Aviacion 
has received the first two of eight 44-passenger Dutch Fokker 
planes Cuba has purchased from the Spanish company Aviaco. 
  Rebelde adds that Cuba's largest bicycle factory, currently 
under construction in Santa Clara with PRC cooperation, will 
begin operating in the second half of 1994. Half the factory 
equipment is in Cuba, the remainder in the port of Shanghai 
awaiting shipment. The factory will produce 150,000 bicycles a 
year. 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 2 March reports that Orlando 
Lugo Fonte, president of the National Association of Small 
Farmers, ANAP, has stated in Havana that during 1993 
approximately 2,000 people joined agricultural-livestock 
cooperatives. This brings the number of people working in 
cooperatives to 62,000 nationwide. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 2 March reports that El Cobre 
mine workers plan to produce 1,300 tons of copper concentrate, 
approximately 7 percent over 1993. The mine complex is 
undergoing renovation and technological updating, and this is 
already contributing to increased efficiency. 
  Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 4 March reports that the 
Luxembourg Government today donated 18 tons of nails and 1,000 
hammers to the victims of the heavy rains that affected the 
eastern provinces. The Luxembourg envoy to Havana handed over 
the donation to Carlos Morales, representative of the State 
Committee for Economic Cooperation. This is the result of the UN 
humanitarian aid program, which submitted the request to the 
Luxembourg Government. Luxembourg also donated medicines worth 
$68,000 for the Calixto Garcia and the Pediatric Hospitals in 
Havana.

  [Excerpts] Images of the tour conducted by Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina, in the company of a large number of 
members of the diplomatic corps and accredited journalists, 
through the central provinces of the country still remain fresh 
in our minds. But things were not left at that. Once again, the 
diplomatic offensive went to work, in direct contact with the 
people who are definitely the main characters of Cuban foreign 
policy. This time the diplomats toured areas of interest in 
Havana Province, the production of which is mostly 
agricultural-industrial. 
  On the first day of their tour, the group visited Guines, 
where plantain crops and Blas Roca Calderio Contingent's 
Agricultural- Livestock Cooperative No. 30 are. They also toured 
potato producing areas, a cold storage center, and the national 
center for the production of laboratory animals. In all their 
visits, they spoke to the people. [passage omitted] 
  These workdays through the interior of the country have 
become a window to the world, through which the efforts of the 
Cuban people to overcome can be seen by all.

  [Text] Lev (Mogilevskiy), chairman of the Russian-Cuban 
International Economic Commercial Association, said his 
association will essentially be the strategic group for 
cooperation between Russia and the largest island in the 
Antilles. In an interview with the Russian news agency 
ITAR-TASS, (Mogilevskiy) said the association must solve current 
problems on the renewal of air and maritime transportation and 
development of the tourism industry. He added that 
Russian-Cuban projects include the creation of a mixed 
consortium to extract and refine oil, petrochemistry, and the 
manufacture of minerals and fertilizers.

<F P=106> [Report by Ruben Pino] </F>
  [Text] On the evening of 5 March, Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina departed on a trip to Indonesia. Robaina is accompanied 
by an official delegation from the Foreign Ministry [Minrex]. 
  Robaina told journalists at Jose Marti International Airport 
that the trip will include seven Asian countries: Indonesia, 
Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, India, Myanmar [Burma], and Vietnam. 
Robaina is seeking to spread the truth about the Cuban project. 
  [Begin recording] [Pino] What are Minrex's expectations from 
these meetings? 
  [Robaina] I believe the expectations are part of everything 
that has been done, I do not want to say in the last year, 
rather in the past. Nowadays we live at a faster tempo and thus 
we need to explain more energetically what we are doing and to 
keep abreast of what is happening in the world. I believe that 
Asia is no exception in this diplomatic offensive. I plan to 
listen to many opinions. I believe that there is much to learn 
from this part of the world and much to contribute. This is the 
main goal of the trip. [end recording]

  [Text] During a news conference on 3 March, CONACOM brought 
total support to the crisis resolution ratified by the Chamber 
of Deputies on 2 March. Besides Victor Benoit, present were the 
current minister of education and spokesman for the National 
Front for Change and Democracy [FNCD], Dunois Eric Cantave, 
former Aristide presidential commission member Micha Gaillard, 
and BP-FNCD bloc president Jude Marie-Jacinthe Jean-Baptiste. 
The following is a report by Varrio Serran. 
  [Begin recording] [Serran] No to the clean-sweep strategy, 
no 
to political inertia, but yes to the parliamentarians' realistic 
initiative aimed at resolving the country's crisis. These are 
the words of CONACOM leader, Victor Benoit. According to him: On 
the one hand, this plan meets President Aristide's principal 
demands -- his return to power and General Cedras' early 
retirement; on the other hand, it meets that of the commander in 
chief -- amnesty to the military. 
  [Benoit] It is a set of proposals in keeping with the 
Constitution, the Governors Island agreement, the New York pact, 
the Miami conference, and a series of documents to which CONACOM 
feels it is linked. It also respects the demands of the entire 
political class -- the formation of a government of national 
concord, sociopolitical appeasement, and national 
reconciliation. This proposal also respects what all strata of 
the country are demanding: the lifting of the embargo so people 
can work under proper conditions. 
  [Serran] To make a long story short, in CONACOM's opinion, 
this plan offers the means to extricate the country from its 
deadlock through facilitation of, among other things, the 
restoration of the head of state, cessation of violence, 
reduction in the high cost of living, protection of the 
country's institutions, and removal of the sanctions. Asked 
about the division that seems to have developed within the FNCD 
over this plan, BP-FNCD President Jude Marie- Jacinthe 
Jean-Baptiste replied that the divergences are only on the 
tactical plane, but that regarding restoration of the head of 
state to his post, the front remains united. Does CONACOM's 
firm, vital support of this plan include a wild run for the post 
of prime minister? Certainly not, said Victor Benoit, who drew 
up a profile of those who would run for this post. 
  [Benoit] The following is a profile of those who would 
discreetly run for prime minister. I am going to give you this 
profile so you can identify them: They are either in Haiti or 
abroad and claim to side with President Aristide. Actually, some 
are very close to him. They do not talk or take a stand at all. 
They do not take a stand publicly. But they behave as if they 
completely agree with anything the president thinks. They have 
no personal advice to give. They do not behave as people who 
have a personality. They behave as simple opportunists because 
they know it is the president who will appoint the prime 
minister. As there are political divisions, they agree with the 
president up and down the line. 
  [Serran] Nobody, not President Aristide, not his advisors, 
not the international personalities we have met, nobody can say 
that Victor has ever tried to run for prime minister, Benoit 
said, adding: We are the president's allies, but not his 
sycophants. Political inertia can kill. Politics presupposes not 
only a stance, but also an initiative. This person in charge of 
political affairs for CONACOM added that some people are linked 
to President Aristide, the person. But we, he said, are linked 
to the cause that President Aristide defends. 
  Asked finally about the alliance arising from circumstances 
in the Chamber of Deputies among the BP-FNCD, the socialist bloc 
dominated by the Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary Party 
of Haiti, and the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion, the 
CONACOM leader explained that in politics, yesterday's adversary 
may today be an ally, and today's ally may be an adversary 
tomorrow. What is fundamental is the [common] goal. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Edwige Balutansky] </F>
  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 4 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Today, parliament 
sources revealed the Haitian Military High Command reportedly 
rejected a proposal by a group of lawmakers to return to the 
democratic system in the country. The military leadership and a 
parliamentary delegation met on Thursday for three hours to 
analyze the project observers have called "neither-nor," which 
stands for neither Army Chief Raoul Cedras, nor deposed 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
  The military has not yet commented publicly on the plan, 
which is supported by the U.S. State Department, while some 
legislators expressed reservations following the meeting local 
radio stations termed "tumultuous. It is too early to tell what 
the military will say. We hope they can understand that this is 
the best solution," Duly Brutus, one of the members of the 
congressional delegation, stated. A legislator said the military 
has reacted "with anger and indignation," and has questioned 
"the parliamentarians' authority to make decisions involving the 
military without first consulting the military." Aristide, 
overthrown in September of 1991 in a coup d'etat led by Cedras, 
does not support the legislators' plan either. 
  Point five of the initiative stipulates Army Chief Gen. 
Raoul 
Cedras' retirement, and Point six, the appointment of a new 
chief of police. Although Point 11 refers to the return of the 
president, the initiative's supporters say this is a way of 
indefinitely prolonging his exile because first, the sanctions 
would be lifted and no date for his return has been set. "The 
transition to democracy involved concessions from all the 
parties," Marc Bazin, second de facto prime minister, declared.

  [Text] San Jose, 3 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- The Costa Rican 
Government and business sector today described the conclusion of 
free trade negotiations with Mexico as "a fundamental step in 
the process of opening new markets." Foreign Trade Minister 
Roberto Rojas indicated that with the treaty "an increase in 
Costa Rican exports to Mexican markets is anticipated," which 
could bring in from $60 million annually to nearly $250 million 
in 1996. 
  This Thursday, Costa Rica and Mexico announced the 
conclusion 
of negotiations that began in August 1991, as well as the 
signing of an agreement by next April. The Costa Rican official 
stated that when the treaty enters into effect on 1 January 
1995, it will be possible to freely export products such as 
televisions, electrical energy distribution equipment, and dry 
batteries. Items that will benefit from zero customs tax also 
include polyester filaments used in textile manufacturing, 
motorcycle safety helmets, and safety deposit boxes. 
  "Likewise, preferences deriving from a partial extension 
agreement that includes 150 customs items with a five-percent 
maximum tax were also consolidated." Among the items included in 
this category are glass bottles, aluminum products, rubber 
tires, leather suitcases and wallets, leather shoes, and wood 
doors. 
  Rojas added that the Costa Rican textile industry was 
favored 
with a $5 million quota for clothing garments which is expected 
to increase each year by 15 percent. The minister emphasized 
that in the areas of intellectual property rights and services 
guarantees the Costa Rican system "will not have to be 
substantially modified." 
  The document establishes that "Mexican investment, already 
present in the country for several years now, will continue to 
be encouraged in Costa Rica." 
  Rojas emphasized that this agreement is the result of 
several 
months of negotiations and close coordination between both 
countries' governments and private sectors. "All things 
considered, the agreement places us in the forefront of the 
political map of those Latin American countries that are drawing 
closer to the path of hemispheric integration," the Costa Rican 
official commented. 
  The bilateral treaty includes chapters on areas covering 
market access, guidelines for country of origin, unfair trading 
practices, services, investments, solving disputes, purchases 
from the public sector, and intellectual property, among others. 
  Costa Rican businessmen pointed out that the treaty will 
facilitate greater trade flow under conditions of openness, 
equality, and mutual benefit for Mexico as well as for Costa 
Rica. They stressed that Costa Rica was able to ensure that the 
principle of asymmetry was reflected in terms of customs 
preferences for the entry of most Costa Rican products into 
Mexico and the purchase of Mexican raw materials with zero taxes. 
  With respect to the guidelines which will determine the 
origin of the items included in the treaty, local businessmen 
indicated that the Raw Material Regional Integration Committee 
(CIRI) was established. It will be responsible for evaluating 
and solving any disputes related to the supply of regional raw 
materials.

  [Text] San Jose, 4 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, President 
Rafael Angel Calderon said the free trade agreement to be signed 
with Mexico next month "is an entry gate" to NAFTA. At the 
inauguration ceremony of a business, shortly after returning 
from Panama, Calderon stated that in the next five years some 
Latin American countries will have the possibility of joining 
NAFTA, signed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada, and 
Costa Rica "will be one of the candidates." 
  He added that he will contribute, with his experience, from 
the ranks of the opposition, which he will rejoin on 8 May when 
he hands power over to social democrat Jose Maria Figueres, so 
Costa Rica can join commercial treaties like NAFTA. 
  Yesterday, Costa Rican and Mexican delegations concluded 
three years of negotiations leading to the commercial treaty 
that Calderon and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
will sign in April and which will enter into force on 1 January 
1995. 
  Calderon, who looked "very happy" about the successful 
culmination of the talks, urged the Legislative Assembly to 
immediately proceed with the free trade agreement that, he 
pointed out, offers Costa Rican producers a market of 90 million 
people. 
  The president hailed his country's negotiating team and 
spotlighted Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas, who led the 
negotiations, a person Calderon regarded as "one of the best 
ministers" his country has had. "It is an extraordinary 
agreement. The culmination of three years of effort," the 
president affirmed, and he added that Mexican investments, based 
on the treaty, can increase $300 million a year. 
  Calderon flew to Panama on Wednesday to attend the 
inauguration of a commercial fair, and later he met with his 
Panamanian counterpart Guillermo Endara to analyze the European 
Union's restrictions on banana imports.

  [Text] The government will earmark 230 million colones of 
the national budget this year to pay for land expropriated from 
U.S. citizens, Deputy Presidency Minister Alejandro Matamoros 
has stated. The official has said that the allocations were 
included in the regular budget for this period, as well as in 
1993's extraordinary budget. 
  The payments will be made in installments, based on the 
decision by the appropriate bodies, such as the Direct Tax 
General Directorate, Finance Ministry, or the arbitration courts 
established to that effect. 
  Matamoros has said the Qualls family will receive 23 million 
colones in two installments before the current government ends, 
based on a decision against the state by the arbitration court. 
It will be up to the next administration to allocate 92.8 
million colones, which must be paid for the expropriation of a 
farm measuring 1,439 hectares in Sierpe, Osa Caton, Puntarenas. 
  Regarding the Titisa case, the authorities will make two 
payments of 22 million colones each, according to a ruling by 
the arbitration court, which will settle the dispute over the 
499-hectare farm in Golfito. There will be another allocation 
to pay Richard Bell for property measuring 7,176 hectares in 
Potrero Grande, Buenos Aires Canton. The first payment of 45 
million colones is to be made in May out of a total of 90 
million colones that were included in the national budget for 
this year. The arbitration court has ordered the government to 
pay 183 million colones. 
  Matamoros has said the next administration has to settle the 
dispute over the Santa Elena farm with U.S. citizen Joseph 
Hamilton. The property is presently being measured to pass that 
information to the World Bank court later.

<F P=106> [Report by Basilio Quesada Chanto] </F>
  [Text] The Technical Customs Investigations Division (DITA) 
is investigating the suspicious importation of large quantities 
of isopropyl alcohol [alcohol hidropropilico] not only for 
possible fiscal irregularities but also for potential links to 
drug trafficking activities. 
  This chemical substance presumably can be used to process 
cocaine, "crack," and other drugs, thus DITA personnel suspect 
that a cocaine laboratory may be operating in the country. 
According to the police report, this type of alcohol, which was 
presumably shipped from El Salvador, cannot be used for medical 
or industrial (liquor production) purposes. Furthermore, it is 
described as a solvent on the list of suspected precursor 
chemicals. 
  DITA grew even more suspicious when Costa Rican authorities 
called the Salvadoran firm noted as the shipper on the customs 
entry document, and the firm said it does not distribute that 
type of product. 
  DITA will coordinate the case with the Government and Public 
Security Ministry's national drug control directorate as there 
is enough evidence to suggest that a cocaine laboratory is 
behind the importing firm. The latter is believed to be a ghost 
company as it does not have any physical location or personnel 
to handle the alcohol it has brought into the country. The 
company has imported more than 40,000 liters of isopropyl 
alcohol from October 1993 to date. The final destination of the 
chemical is unknown.

  [Text] Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate for the 
ruling party, the Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), will 
need a second round of elections to win the 20 March elections, 
according to the latest electoral survey. 
  The survey, conducted by the firm CID-Gallup, has shown that 
during the first round of elections, Calderon will obtain 32 
percent of the votes, while Ruben Zamora, candidate for the 
leftist coalition Democratic Convergence, which includes the 
former FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] 
guerrilla organization, will obtain only 16 percent. 
  Fidel Chavez Mena, the Christian Democratic Party's (PDC) 
candidate, will finish third with 10 percent of the votes, while 
Roberto Escobar, of the National Conciliation Party (PCN), will 
be fourth with two percent, according to the survey. 
  To win the Salvadoran Presidency during the first round of 
elections a candidate must obtain 50 percent plus one of the 
votes; otherwise, there will be a second round of elections, 
according to the electoral law. 
  According to the survey, during which 2,100 people were 
interviewed throughout the country from 18 to 25 February, 40 
percent of the voters are still undecided on which candidate 
they will support. 
  Should there be a second round of elections between Calderon 
and Zamora, 37 percent would chose the official candidate, while 
22 percent would vote for his opponent, and 41 percent are still 
undecided, according to the survey. 
  In case the second round of elections is between Calderon 
Sol 
and Chavez Mena, the preferences would be 36 percent against 20 
percent, in favor of the Arena candidate. 
  CID-Gallup Executive Director Olda Maria Acuna has said at a 
news conference out of the 40 percent of undecided voters, four 
percent chose Arena, 2 percent the leftist coalition, and 
another 2 percent the PDC [figures as received]. 
  Acuna has said the high percentage of undecided voters could 
be the "decisive factor" of the 20 March elections, and she did 
not rule out the possibility there could be a "surprise." 
  More than 2 million Salvadorans will elect a new president 
and vice president, as well as 84 Legislative Assembly deputies, 
262 municipal mayors, and 20 representatives to the Central 
American Parliament (Parlacen). 
  The electoral law prohibits the publication of surveys two 
weeks before the elections.

  [Text] The last electoral survey conducted by the

Republican Alliance] remains the favorite, followed by the 
leftist coalition and the Christian Democratic Party [PDC]. 
[Begin unidentified speaker recording] A total of 33.3 percent 
of those surveyed said they would vote for Arena; namely, 
Armando Calderon Sol. Ruben Zamora of the tripartite FMLN 
[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front], Democratic 
Convergence [CD], and MNR [National Revolutionary Movement] 
coalition follows him with 19.8 percent. Fidel Chavez Mena 
comes in third with 8.9 percent. [end recording] 
  On congressional elections, (?30.1) percent said they would 
vote for Arena, 16.2 percent said they would vote for the FMLN, 
and 10.3 for the PDC. The [name indistinct] and the CD took 
fourth and fifth place, respectively. Among those polled on 
congressional and presidential elections, 7 percent were 
undecided and approximately 25 percent declined to give an 
opinion, which keeps the possibility of runoff elections open. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] We must be honest and 
responsible by saying that with only a few weeks left before the 
elections, the polls are not infallible. We do not know how the 
undecided and those who refuse to comment will vote. [end 
recording] 
  [Words indistinct] all over the country, 18 percent favored 
Arena and 10.4 percent the FMLN. The PDC came in third with 6.1 
percent, but 52.3 percent of those surveyed declined to comment.

<F P=106> [Statement drafted and released by the Citizens of the East, </F>
Center, and West: "The Embassy's Hand in the Court's Election;" 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] Once again, the U.S. Embassy attempts to meddle in 
our domestic affairs, as it has been doing throughout our 
country's history. Not satisfied with bossing the Executive 
Branch as it pleased regarding the peace agreements, this time 
the embassy attempts to override the Legislative Assembly -- a 
highly vulnerable branch, as has been demonstrated over and over 
with the constitutional reform -- by trying to impose a Supreme 
Court of Justice [CSJ] willing to bend at the slightest hint 
from State Department officials. 
  A list with the names of candidates of various political 
inclinations -- is the list the result of a consensus? -- which 
did not even meet the requirements demanded by law. [sentence as 
published] In addition, international news agency reports 
announced to the world that Dr. Armando Calderon Sol had agreed 
to negotiate the CSJ in exchange for the certainty that he would 
win the presidency of the Republic in the March elections. 
  This nefarious meddling has been confirmed by the president 
of one of the lawyers' associations that present lists of 
candidates for the new CSJ. This person held the position of 
minister of justice in the first Revolutionary Junta of the 
Government, which came into being by the grace of the 
indescribable embassy, after General Romero's overthrow. This 
same minister was the originator, or at least the leading 
drafter, of the Junta's historic decree that declared the 1962 
Constitution in force "in everything not running contrary to the 
Armed Forces' 15 October proclamation...." This legal 
monstrosity of a decree can only be compared to another, which 
said "for this once only," issued by the infamous Generals 
Martinez and Castaneda Castro. 
  We are extremely concerned that this lawyer, who is also the 
proxy of the multinational oil enterprise recently found to be 
involved in a scandal because its president was arrested, is the 
patron of the "No to Continuism" campaign, contrary to the 
principle accepted by American law saying that magistrates 
should be "left in their positions permanently" and even be left 
therein for life for the sake of a healthy administration of 
justice. 
  Finally, we wish to say that these impossible-to-understand 
positions can only be explained by the obstinate and determined 
position of the U.S. Government, which dared finance a Truth 
Commission, whose exclusive role was to discredit and lash out 
at the Judicial Branch for the sole reason that this branch 
remained independent and resisted the pressure to make our 
country more vulnerable to foreign interests. 
  We reject foreign interests and their well-paid lawyers! We 
want magistrates to be appointed for their capabilities, not for 
their interests or ideologies! Out with the foreign political 
handling of the Judicial Branch! 
  [Signed] Citizens of the East, Center, and West.

20 March elections, as has been speculated in the past days. He 
said there is enough foreign currency in the market to make the 
currency stable. Edwin Gongora filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Gongora] Orellana pointed out that, with 
the exchange system currently in place, colon devaluations could 
hardly occur because the system depends on foreign exchange 
supply and demands in the market. In this respect, Orellana 
emphasized that there are enough dollars available to prevent 
currency devaluations. 
  [Orellana] I want to tell you that exports, remittance, 
foreign aid, and loans generate enough dollars. In short, there 
are enough dollars to meet all the country's needs. There is no 
possibility of devaluations because the system prevents them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate for </F>
Democratic Convergence, Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front, and National Revolutionary Movement, by unidentified 
reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Following the collapse of the East 
European statist economies, very few politicians are bold enough 
to propose socialist-oriented government plans, something that 
the Salvadoran left has been identified with for a long time. 
What is the CD/FMLN/MNR [Democratic Convergence, Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front, National Revolutionary 
Movement] economic proposal for these elections? 
  [Zamora] There is certainly a common denominator among all 
candidates. I personally do not like to talk about a social 
market economy because the term no longer has any meaning in our 
country. Everybody uses it, even when referring to different 
aspects, such as Arena's [Nationalist Republican Alliance] 
proposal. For example, the German social market economy is 
completely different. Furthermore, this is a tautology, because 
the market is social. 
  The first points in the CD/FMLN/MNR platform are based on 
the 
following concepts: 
  First, we believe in the existence of a market. It is the 
most important force in the economy. 
  Second, because the market is deaf to certain signals, we 
see 
the role of the state as supplemental. The state must create 
the legal framework, facilitate redistribution, and correct 
market irregularities. 
  Third, our objective is to achieve self-sustained and 
equitable economic development based on the new actors in the 
economy. That is the difference between our proposal and 
Arena's. Their proposal calls for a concentration of efforts on 
strong capital under the assumption that there will be enormous 
growth, which will subsequently bring well-being to society. 
That is not what happens. 
  The income of Salvadorans has replaced coffee as the main 
source of foreign exchange. For the first time in history, the 
main source of foreign exchange comes directly from popular 
sectors. Our strategy will not be based on excluding major 
capital but on giving priority to the new actors: cooperatives, 
the informal sector, and small and medium enterprises. 
  Fourth, we link social development to economic development. 
We see social services -- especially health and education -- 
not as an expense but as an investment for economic development. 
  Our fifth pillar is Central American integration. Arena is 
proposing integration strictly at the capital and technocratic 
level. Many plans have been formulated without consulting 
businessmen or other sectors. The integration we propose calls 
for the participation of workers, businessmen, and the state. 
  [Reporter] You have said that you prefer not to talk about 
social market economy. Your plan, however, must follow a path. 
What path have you chosen? 
  [Zamora] We propose a method in accordance with all these 
principles. It can be summarized in one expression: concerted 
efforts. 
  The wisdom of economic development is not allowing the veto 
to begin functioning as it did in the past. Workers veto 
government plans and destabilize them; businessmen veto 
government plans -- as in President Duarte's case -- because the 
grass roots followed a policy of confrontation. 
  Government policy must be the result of concerted efforts 
with the various sectors. 
  [Reporter] Leftist economic ideas have always been 
associated 
with statism, with planned economies. You have said you believe 
in market forces. Does that mean you have given up the 
socialist model? 
  [Zamora] I cannot give up something I never believed in. I 
never believed in that type of socialism because, in my opinion, 
it has never been real socialism. It was only statism and 
control by a single party; that was it. Do not ask me to give 
up something I never believed in. It would be too easy. It 
would be like giving up the Spanish king's treasures. Of course 
I would give them up because they were never mine. 
  This is an important question because I want to make one 
thing clear: Our government will not be a government of our 
coalition. It will be a government where the CD\FMLN\MNR forces 
are present, but we will try to express concerted efforts. 
  There will be no nationalizations during our term. We do not 
believe statization [estatizacion] should be exercised under 
these circumstances. We are not in favor of expropriations. In 
facing the problem of price controls, our position is that they 
can only be allowed for a limited time when special 
circumstances require them. We believe freezing prices is the 
most absurd thing in the world. 
  We will seek a more efficient economy that is capable of 
both 
producing and allowing a better distribution of wealth, which is 
now very limited. 
  [Reporter] What will be state's role be in the economy? 
Developing a policy of assistance? 
  [Zamora] We disagree with a policy of assistance. The state 
does play an important role in the economy. It has in the past. 
Our country's development since the 1950's was based on the 
state's support for major capital. It can be seen in all our 
laws. Today criticizing the state is fashionable even though 
all the major capital was created with state support. 
  We must determine the scope of state participation. We do 
not believe in an enterprise state. The state has too many 
problems to resolve to get involved in the hotel business or to 
run a textile factory. 
  We propose a plan that will mean increasing expenses in the 
social area. We have clearly proposed tripling the percentage 
of GNP spent on education and health in the next five years. 
  [Reporter] How do you plan to finance those social 
expenditures? 
  [Zamora] First, by redistributing the budget. We cannot live 
with military budgets. We must transfer those funds to the 
social area. 
  Second, by revising state expenses. The government spent 
more than 20 million colones on radio and television from 
October to December. I realize the state must spend money on 
publicity when it offers a service and must inform the people, 
such as the vaccination and identification card campaigns. It 
is not necessary, however, to spend money to say that FINATA 
[National Financial Institution for Agricultural Lands] is doing 
a good job. 
  Third, by controlling tax evasion. The Finance Ministry has 
estimated it at 40 percent. We believe it is closer to 50 
percent. If we manage to reduce it to at least 30 percent, we 
will have money for social expenses. 
  Finally, through international aid. We do not have to sit 
back and watch how aid is being reduced. We must seek means of 
cooperation. 
  We believe it is feasible to finance social expenses without 
increasing taxes. We are not in favor of increasing taxes, but 
we do feel they must be collected. For example, there is 
widespread evasion of the value-added tax. There are 706 
enterprises here controlling more than 70 percent of all sales. 
We simply want people to comply with the law. 
  Our view is that the central government should be reduced so 
local and municipal governments and associations can assume more 
responsibility and resources. 
  [Reporter] In Latin America, the general practice of 
opposition political parties has been to change the schemes of 
outgoing governments and interrupt the continuity of programs. 
What would your coalition do with the economic plan initiated 
by the current government? 
  [Zamora] The key to the country's governability during this 
period consists of recognizing the real relationship between 
continuity and change. 
  Once the peace agreements were signed, the country began a 
process of national agreement. It is expressed in a reformed 
constitution which is the result of a consensus. Now it is not 
a matter of starting from scratch every five years. We must see 
what plans need modifications. 
  The current government's handling of macroeconomic variables 
is quite healthy. Why change it? There are programs that 
permit participation, such as Educo, which must be developed. 
Of course, in other areas we will do things quite differently. 
The possibility of an energy policy, for example, must be 
considered. This government could not implement it, but it will 
have to be done through a national agreement. Environmental 
issues have been neglected. We will have to make changes there, 
too. Credit policy has been mainly for those with more capital. 
Now that we are in the electoral campaign, they are talking 
about credits for small enterprises. 
  We must determine where change is necessary. We will analyze 
each area one by one and decide where there should be 
continuity, where corrections should be made, and where changes 
are necessary. 
  That is our vision.

<F P=106> [Report by Nelda Alvaragenga; from the "Facing the Moment" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Human rights organizations concurred on Friday with 
UN expert Pedro Nikken that human rights violations have 
increased in the country. Reynaldo Blanco, of the Salvadoran 
Human Rights Commission [CDHES], has affirmed violations of 
fundamental rights are becoming a rising trend. 
  [Begin Blanco recording] I must say there is an upward 
trend. 
We have not reached the level that existed before the peace 
accords were signed. By comparing the period from the time the 
peace accords were signed to date, say, comparing the first half 
of 1992 with the second half of that same year, we begin to 
notice, however, an increase, chiefly regarding the right to 
live. [end recording] 
  According to Blanco, the increased violations are the result 
of the impunity with which the state intelligence corps continue 
to operate, despite the terms established in the peace accords; 
in this respect, the CDHES representative reiterated the need 
for the United Nations to keep monitoring the country. 
Lutheran Bishop Medardo Gomez has concurred, saying death 
squad-style human rights violations increased during recent 
months. 
  [Begin Gomez recording] As Salvadorans can attest, people 
are 
found murdered in the streets everyday. Taking a closer look at 
those bodies, we find they show signs of torture, something that 
reveals the existence of death squads; for that reason, Mr. 
Nikken is correct in saying human rights are still violated in 
the country. We cannot remove the country from the list of human 
rights violators. [end recording] 
  CDHES and the Lutheran Church stated the peace accords and 
the Truth Commission recommendations should be complied with to 
achieve stability in the country.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "More and More Deportees"] </F>
  [Text] There is no need for illegal immigrants who want to 
go to the United States to arrive at that nation's border with 
Mexico. It is in Mexican territory where those who are looking 
for jobs in North America -- mostly Salvadorans -- fall into the 
hands of the authorities to be subsequently sent to jail until 
their deportation is processed. 
  If there is so much emphasis to travel to the United States 
without meeting the requirements demanded by those authorities 
it is because the [illegal alien] traffickers are successful 
more than once. Of course this serves as propaganda for other 
naive Salvadorans to start securing the $1,000 that it costs to 
put them on the other side of the border for the Lord to help 
them. According to reports we receive from Mexico, the 
detentions continue. The Judicial Technical Police of that 
nation have placed greater emphasis on looking for our people 
and for those of other nations who do not have their documents 
in order and who attempt, with practically nothing, to cross the 
border. Once in North American territory they contact other 
traffickers or relatives to start looking for a job so they can 
stay. This of course is until immigration authorities uncover, 
arrest, and deport them. 
  Previously, it was mostly the Central Americans who 
struggled 
to get on the other side, overcoming the risks in Mexican 
territory. Now, however, the Asians have also joined in; these 
are the ones who pay the traffickers the higher sums. The flow 
of Salvadorans to Uncle Sam's land, however, does not decrease. 
Once there, they hope to gains dollars to send back to their 
relatives who they have left behind praying for them not to be 
captured. The trip is not as easy as it seems. Reports from 
those who have returned, deported from Mexico or the United 
States, have declared that a trip without documents or with 
false documents does not cost less than $1,000. The adventure 
starts with obtaining that sum of money which does not include 
food or the guarantee they will arrive in the "promised land." 
Once they are deported they are back to their old activity. 
Now they have to look for a job, not only to support their 
family but also to pay back the loans they made to pay the 
Salvadoran traffickers. It is said that these traffickers have 
contact with the Mexican traffickers who in turn have contact 
with those in the United States. 
  As we have pointed out in the past, the situation in the 
United States is no longer the same; vigilance is now much 
stricter. The conditions in some states, such as California, is 
absolutely negative for illegal aliens. One must not forget a 
deadline has been set for those who are already there in that 
territory to meet the requirements demanded. That deadline is 
approaching, and a large number of compatriots have 
difficulties, created by the same North American authorities. 
To speak clearly, The United States does not want immigrants, 
and much less those who try to cross over flouting that nation's 
laws. 
  Once again we bring up the issue to suggest to the 
Salvadoran 
immigration authorities to adopt an official campaign targeted 
at those who want to live and work in the United States, in 
order to send help to their families. They must be made to 
understand that to fall in the hands of the traffickers is to 
throw away their money, as they will be deported either from 
Mexico or the United States. Once back they will be in worse 
shape than before, including their health given the conditions 
they had to face. If the immigration authorities try to explain 
to the stubborn individuals who want to travel without the 
required document by citing the very reports of the deportees, 
it is possible that many will avoid that failure. They should 
try to make their life here or travel to North America with the 
required documents.

<F P=106> [Report by Connie Ochoa Gomez] </F>
  [Text] Guadalajara, Jalisco, 28 February -- Jaime Serra 
Puche, secretary of commerce and industrial development, has 
said the foreign investment law implemented in January 1994 
makes Mexico competitive enough to attract savings from abroad 
to complement national savings, therefore "there will be no 
further modifications to the law." 
  Serra Puche stressed that the federal government does not 
plan to adjust the laws to NAFTA as the modifications needed to 
make the country more competitive "have already been made." 
  In an exclusive interview for EL FINANCIERO, Serra Puche 
said 
the Mexican Government is studying the possibility of signing 
bilateral agreements to protect the investments of countries 
with the largest amount of foreign investment in our country; in 
other words, Europe and Japan. 
  This does not mean that Mexico will not offer legal 
guarantees to countries other than the United States and Canada, 
with whom we signed a trade agreement, that wish to participate 
in the Mexican market. Proof of this is that in 1993 we 
received foreign capital totaling $15.6 billion, which means 
that among developing countries, Mexico receives the largest 
amount of foreign investment in the world. 
  Even the sad incidents in southeastern Mexico have not 
reduced investors' confidence in Mexico. Foreign investment 
reached $2.370 billion in January, a sum equivalent to what the 
country received "for an entire year" six years ago. In other 
words, all indications are that Mexico is highly competitive and 
that investors view us as a nation with great possibilities for 
growth and stability. 
  Serra Puche stressed that NAFTA represents a region open to 
trade, which is confirmed by the fact that Mexico proposed the 
clause giving other countries access to the treaty. 
  He said the government is studying the possibility of 
signing 
bilateral agreements to protect foreign investment, giving 
priority to Europe and Japan, but a final decision has not been 
reached. 
  European trade representatives have noted the importance of 
Mexico's signing bilateral agreements to protect investments, 
particularly the establishment of impartial judges who can 
guarantee the resolution of controversies between foreign 
companies and the Mexican Government as established in NAFTA. 
In that manner, other countries would have the same privileges 
as Canada and the United States when investing in the Mexican 
market. 
  Serra Puche reiterated that "we are not planning to make 
additional changes" to Mexican laws, even though some exporters 
claim that national laws "fall short" of covering the scope of 
the trilateral agreement. 
  In the specific case of the Intellectual Property Law, for 
which "changes are not being contemplated, either," Serra Puche 
stressed that Mexico's regulations to protect intellectual 
property are already internationally recognized as their legal 
and institutional framework has been modernized; therefore, no 
further adjustments are warranted. 
  During the interview conducted near the Miguel Hidalgo 
Airport in Guadalajara, Serra Puche categorically said that 
Mexican exports "today are under conditions equal" to similar 
products in the United States and Canada, as great efforts have 
been made to improve quality to raise their competitive level. 
  The export sector, however, has persistently demanded that 
the Mexican Government give specific support to Mexican 
enterprises so they can compensate for the existing differences 
between Mexico and its main commercial partners. 
  In that regard, Serra Puche said that NAFTA "does not permit 
the application of subsidies to exports."

  [Text] Jaime Serra Puche, commerce and industrial 
development secretary, and Roy MacLaren, Canadian international 
trade minister, have confirmed their governments' willingness 
for other nations to join NAFTA. 
  Serra and MacLaren on 28 February reviewed some aspects of 
NAFTA implementation and prepared the trade agenda for the 
Mexican-Canadian meeting that will take place today. 
  In a brief interview following the meeting, Serra said the 
Mexican Government's position remains "as it has always been," 
one of granting other nations access to NAFTA. 
  Minister MacLaren, who agreed with Serra, added that the 
objective is to ensure that the NAFTA area is open, not a 
"closed fortress." 
  Serra and MacLaren met behind closed doors and gave only 
brief answers to reporters' questions. The two also announced 
that ExpoCanada will be held on 23 and 24 March. 
  Serra said this was a meeting "between friends" and that he 
hopes he will soon be able to return MacLaren's visits. 
  Today the two officials will discuss trade and investment, 
promotion of businesses, cooperation, statistics, intellectual 
property, and multilateral relations. 
  Official figures reveal that trade between Mexico and Canada 
has been small-scale with slight growth in 1994. 
  Mexico has had a virtually permanent trade deficit with 
Canada. As of 1993, however, Mexico has became Canada's largest 
commercial partner and constitutes Canada's sixth largest 
supplier. 
  In 1993 Mexico sold Canada goods worth 5 million Canadian 
dollars, almost twice as much as the amount traded three years 
ago. In addition, Canadian investment in Mexico is some $700 
million, almost twice as much as the investment figure for 1989. 
  Leading Canadian imports include assembly material for 
vehicles, wheat, radio and telegraphic equipment, iron and steel 
sheets, and iron and steel bars and ingots. 
  The main products Mexico exports to Canada include passenger 
vehicles, crude, spare parts and engines for vehicles, and 
data-processing machines, among other things. 
  Trade prospects are expected to increase between the two 
nations. Since the end of 1993, some 6,500 Mexican companies 
have visited the Canadian Embassy trade section seeking to do 
business with that country. Sectors that have expressed the 
greatest commercial interest include those dealing with 
transportation equipment, food, and traditional areas such as 
paper pulp manufacturing and telecommunications. 
  Meanwhile, Canadians have expressed a great interest in such 
the chemical and mining industries. There are 70 Canadian 
mining companies in Mexico with the number increasing all the 
time.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Swedish companies which had established 
operations in Mexico as a means of gaining access to that 
market, are now reducing their operations, according to the 2 
February Stockholm business weekly VECKANS AFFARER. The weekly 
notes that many of these firms had originally invested in Mexico 
when its economy was based on import substitution and that they 
are now encountering competition from imports from the United 
States. 
  The Swedish-Swiss electronics and engineering giant Asea 
Brown Boveri (ABB), which has seen its sales fall 50 percent 
over the last two years, has closed two of its five plants and 
slashed its Mexican work force by half. Atlas Copco, a mining 
equipment manufacturer, has also reduced its Mexican staff and 
production and increased its imports from the United States. 
While Tetra Pak has expanded its Mexican operations and is 
increasing its share of the milk packaging market, it expects 
increased competition from imported U.S. milk. 
  Even Ericsson, which has long been the largest Swedish 
investor and a leading telecommunications manufacturer in 
Mexico, now has to defend its position against competition from 
AT&amp;T, Northern Telecom, and Motorola. It also has cut back 
its 
work force in an effort to control costs. Ericsson's head of 
Mexican operations, Gerhard Skladal, expects the company to 
replace many of its Swedish-made components with U.S. inputs and 
he hopes that at the same time Ericsson will be able to increase 
sales from its Mexican plants to the rest of North America. 
  The weekly also reports complaints by businessmen that 
Mexico 
needs to improve its infrastructure and productivity levels, 
which at present are not comparable to those of industrialized 
countries. Skladal notes: "We figure that we will need to hire 
at least 3-4 times more employees to do a certain job here than 
would be necessary in the United States." The chief of Atlas 
Copco's Mexican branch expects that company to increase its 
production in the United States, because "it is hardly logical 
for us to invest in Mexico right now." Both ABB and Ericsson 
hope that infrastructure improvements in Mexico will open new 
markets for their products. Ericsson wants to upgrade the 
Mexican telecommunications system to Western standards, and ABB 
is optimistic about opportunities in the growing Mexican 
automobile industry and in the cement and steel sectors. 
  The revolt in Chiapas is apparently having little effect on 
investment decisions, according to the report. "Those of us who 
have been here for a long time and know the country are not 
scared off," says ABB's head of Mexican operations, Luiz Bring.

  [Text] The Information and Press Department of the Army 
[DIDE] has revealed that five soldiers were killed and two were 
injured when a group of subversives ambushed a military patrol 
in the neighborhood of Cuarto Pueblo, Quiche Department. 
  Julio Cas Paau, Manuel Perez Hernandez, Jose Antonio Santos 
Jordan, Hector Cruz, and Arnoldo Archila Picon were among the 
deceased, while Salvador Galicia Garcia and Hector Anibal Lopez 
were injured. 
  In addition, the Army urged the people "to judge these 
criminal actions that once more show total disrespect by the 
guerrillas toward the human rights of Guatemalan families." 
  DIDE also disclosed that 52 Central Americans who were 
trying 
to cross the border with Mexico illegally were arrested in the 
waters of Ocos Port, San Marcos by Navy patrols from the Pacific 
Naval Base. The group of illegal immigrants was made up of 20 
Salvadorans, 14 Nicaraguans, and 12 Hondurans, who had no 
documents and were accompanied by six Guatemalans and three 
guides identified as Santiago Escobar Lopez, Anselmo Cuadros 
Perez, and Carlos Vicente Ramirez.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 6 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Official sources 
confirmed today at least two propaganda bombs from the 
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG), whose leadership 
is negotiating peace with the government, exploded in the past 
few hours in this city leaving no victims. 
  The National Police Press Office told ACAN-EFE the explosive 
devices, filled with leaflets from the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR), 
one of four organizations that make up the URNG, detonated in 
two Guatemala City zones. 
  The source said the leaflets from the FAR, an armed group 
operating in the northern region under the leadership of 
Commander Pablo Monsanto, marked its "32 years of revolutionary 
struggle." 
  Several unidentified people dynamited the foundations of the 
San Juan bridge, which is located at km 20 of the Atlantic-bound 
highway, early this morning. The incident, besides causing 
property damage, created serious traffic jams. 
  The Army dispatched a delegation to the site to investigate 
if the guerrillas perpetrated the attack, which destroyed the 
bridge, and to estimate property damage. 
  The terrorist attack and the bomb explosions are occurring 
as 
the government and guerrillas are meeting in Mexico to end the 
oldest internal armed conflict in the region.

  [Text] Finance Minister Ana de Molina said yesterday that 
the public workers' trade unions will not accept any government 
proposal regarding their salary demands because the salary issue 
is only a pretext for a movement to destabilize the government. 
  The minister said the union leaders will not accept a bonus 
or a 100-, 200-, or 300-quetzal wage increase because obviously 
the salary hike is not the real reason why the government is 
being pressured. "If there was a genuine desire to find a 
solution to the problem, the situation would be different," de 
Molina affirmed. 
  The finance minister said it still cannot be determined who 
is behind the destabilizing movement, adding that several fronts 
have been opened against the current administration. "There is 
invasion of land in the area of agriculture, kidnappings in the 
area of security, strikes in the area of labor, and limitations 
on the finance minister to obtaining resources. This cannot be 
a mere coincidence," Ana de Molina asserted. 
  The minister declared that the position expressed by the 
economic cabinet on Tuesday remains unchanged; specifically, no 
salary negotiating process is being held with union 
representatives. The issue must be treated as part of the Great 
National Agreement (GAN) proposed by President Ramiro De Leon 
Carpio. 
  The minister argued that a wage increase for all state 
workers cannot be called a coherent salary policy because a 
salary hike program includes a review of the efficiency and 
profile of the employee as well as his abilities. 
  She added that by reorganizing the executive branch there 
could be room for a reclassification of wages for those who 
deserve it. 
  The minister also said that if the government's offer of a 
50-quetzal wage increase for workers earning less than 2,000 
quetzales does not meet workers' expectations, it still 
represents a gain for workers and an expense of 120 million 
quetzales annually for the state treasury. 
  The government proposal was to increase basic salaries by 50 
quetzales and reduce the 360-quetzal bonus for fiscal 
collections by 100 quetzales, a proposal made previously by the 
National Federation of Public Employees Unions (FENASEP) and 
accepted by the government. Public workers, however, rejected 
the aforementioned offer. 
<H5>  Bureaucrats Reject 50-Quetzal Increase </H5>
  Leaders of FENASEP and FENASTEG [National Federation of 
State 
Workers Unions] as well as leaders of other state labor unions 
yesterday rejected the 50-quetzal hike proposed by the 
government to solve the labor conflict. 
  The bureaucrats termed the salary increase "an insult to the 
working class." 
  FENASTEG Secretary General Felix Hernandez said: "The 
50-quetzal hike proposed by the government does not meet the 
aspirations or expectations of state workers." 
<H5>  FENASEP Will Not Talk With the Economic Cabinet </H5>
  The FENASEP leadership was scheduled to meet yesterday with 
the economic cabinet. However, the labor leader explained that 
they had changed their mind because "they are fed up" with those 
officials.

  [Text] Huehuetenago -- Thirty-two Central Americans 
(Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Hondurans) were detained and 
taken to the Mexican immigration office at La Mesilla, 
Huehuetenango. 
  They said that the Mexican authorities had treated them 
badly, had given them drugs, accused them of belonging to the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), took their money, and 
held them under arrest for several days. They added that many 
are under arrest in Villa Hermosa, Tabasco, and Chiapas. 
Therefore, they call on the corresponding authorities, as well 
as Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge Mario Garcia Laguardia to 
conduct investigations into the outrages committed against the 
illegal aliens in Mexico.

  [Text] Presidency Secretary General Hector Luna Troccoli 
said yesterday that the state will absorb the fuel price 
differential, after distribution problems are resolved, which 
will result from the measure announced by the municipality and 
the president to sell fuel without including the increase that 
took place after deregulation. 
  He added that if the mayors of the country's main department 
capitals present the respective plan, the government is willing 
to pay the diesel fuel price difference to prevent an increase 
in urban transportation fares. He said that ways are being 
sought to distribute in two or three days 50,000 gallons of 
diesel, which is consumed in the capital, to avoid the pretext 
to increase fares. 
  Luna Troccoli explained that it is not exactly a subsidy 
because the differential payment of a few cents is a temporary 
measure, in view of the fact that future international fuel 
market prices are expected to drop. Luna said that the amount 
the state will cover will depend on the distribution mode and 
that the intention is to take advantage of the drop in the 
profit margin of certain distributors for diesel used for 
transportation. 
  The official was asked what would happen once the price of 
diesel dropped to below what has been set as the reference 
price, and he replied that the government, logically, not only 
does not set the differential, but does not set the rates to 
allow a drop. 
  Lastly, Luna Troccoli said that the use of state 
distributors 
has not been ruled out, but that a study of the most effective 
solution will be completed in the next few hours.

<F P=106> [Report by Danilo Izaguirre; from "The Morning Newspaper" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] President Carlos Roberto Reina has stated his 
position on the World Bank recommendations to Honduras. The 
president refused to consider the recommendations made by the 
World Bank. He said efforts are being made to overcome the 
crisis, particularly the energy crisis and its repercussions on 
the economic stability of our country. 
  Members of the World Bank and international credit 
organizations have recommended that the government privatize the 
National Enterprise for Electric Power [ENEE], the Honduran 
Telecommunications Enterprise (Hondutel), and the National 
Autonomous Aqueduct and Sewage Service (SANAA), among others. 
They also recommended that the National Autonomous University 
of Honduras be privatized, and school tuition be increased. 
These financial institutions suggested that other restrictive 
actions be taken so that the government reduces decentralized 
institutions and some of them disappear. 
  All these actions have been included in a document that was 
delivered to the government on 2 February 1994. President 
Carlos Roberto Reina has said several times he was not going to 
yield to international credit organizations. At this time, 
Reina ratified that the intentions of the international credit 
institutions will not even be taken into consideration, much 
less those of the World Bank. 
  Reina made the aforementioned statements after being 
questioned on his visit to the Foreign Ministry. 
  [Begin recording] [Reina] I come from a meeting with the 
foreign minister and the members of the Commission of 
Sovereignty and Borders. I gave specific instructions to the 
Foreign Ministry. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, what do you know 
about 
the measures the Reina administration must adopt regarding the 
World Bank recommendations? 
  [Reina] I am not aware of those measures. You are better 
informed than I am. 
  [Reporter] But what will the government's position be? Will 
the recommendations made by these institutions be observed? 
  [Reina] Our position is unchanged. The sovereignty 
corresponds to the Honduran people who spoke at the polls. No 
measure recommended by any international organization will even 
be considered if it does not respect the basic interests of our 
people. [end recording] 
  President Reina's statements were very clear. He said he 
will not even consider the recommendations made by international 
credit organizations. When asked about the devaluation, this is 
what he said: 
  [Begin recording] [Reina] Those are very technical terms. 
What we must do is improve the country's economy. If we do not 
improve the country's economy, if we do not produce more, if we 
do not close the commercial deficit of Honduras, it will be 
useless to have wise people handling these affairs. 
  I want the Honduran economy to improve because we produce 
more, we export more. In addition, the secure supply of food 
that I offered during my campaign is a fundamental objective of 
my administration, on which we are working tenaciously and with 
determination. 
  [Unidentified reporter]) Are you concerned about the 
situation of the ENEE in the face of the latest power outages 
and the announcements made by this institution? Will the supply 
of energy receive priority treatment? 
  [Reina] Of course. The situation of the ENEE is serious. It 
has been dragging on for some time. It is partly the result of 
nature. The deforestation of the Francisco Morazan Dam basin is 
part of the problem, but we are seeking, through the most honest 
persons we have been able to find, adequate solutions. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, another problem that concerns 
society is the situation of the ENEE. Some sectors believe this 
situation may deteriorate irreversibly if specific and necessary 
actions are not taken. It is believed this situation may result 
in an increase in energy rates of over 100 percent. A business 
leader stated that the ENEE must file for bankruptcy so it can 
be turned over to private enterprise. To what degree does this 
statement affect the image of the ENEE before the eyes of 
international organizations. 
  [Reina] I do not think that is the solution. This may 
undermine the prestige of the country. We must seek correct 
solutions at the appropriate time. [end recording] 
  These were statements by President Carlos Roberto Reina on 
the recommendations of the World Bank and the actions to be 
taken regarding the ENEE, Hondutel, and SANAA, and specifically 
the problem presented by the announced devaluation.

<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Valeriano Giron] </F>
  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- The measures proposed by 
international financial organizations for implementation in 
Central American countries do not correspond to the current 
situation, it was stated by Gerardo Zepeda Bermudez, assistant 
secretary general of the Secretariat of Central American 
Economic Integration (SIECA). He added that these measures were 
designed for most of the Latin American countries during an 
overall economic recession and when Central America had yet to 
act as a bloc. He said countries on the isthmus will have a 
greater negotiating capability when they strengthen their 
integration scheme and when the terms are based on their 
countries' reality "rather than simple standard guidelines 
implemented in the world." 
  Zepeda Bermudez met with President Carlos Roberto Reina, 
with 
whom he discussed integration issues and the need to implement 
new development strategies in the area based on the countries' 
capability as a bloc. He said the six Central American nations 
will have less clout and strength at the negotiating table with 
regard to these measures if they act individually, because the 
area as a whole has a GNP in excess of $35 billion, which is 
equivalent to that of Chile. 
  Referring to his rejection of President Reina's measures, 
the 
assistant SIECA secretary said no one can continue to believe in 
an institution that imposes general measures or thinks that the 
measures will be effective in Central America because they were 
effective in other countries. He said the area must have its own 
identity and it is necessary to discuss the situation with 
international credit organizations. He also recommends planning 
alternatives and a willingness to achieve development, which is 
what President Reina has implied, he said. 
  Zepeda Bermudez said a social integration system is in its 
preliminary stages, complemented by the economic integration 
system which has existed for 33 years. He emphasized the 
importance of acting as a bloc, taking into consideration that 
this is the only way to face international financial 
organizations and the powerful countries' groups which have been 
created.

  [Text] San Pedro Sula -- Finance Minister Juan Ferrera said 
he is willing to resign from his post if someone can prove to 
him that the Armed Forces have not handled the Honduran 
Telecommunications Enterprise, Hondutel, in a corrupt way. 
  Ferrera accused members of the Armed Forces who have managed 
Hondutel of committing acts of corruption, although he clarified 
that there are some honest soldiers. Ferrera questioned those 
opposed to Hondutel's privatization, because he believes it is a 
profitable enterprise. He added that an enterprise should be 
sold when it is profitable in order to receive good offers and 
not when it goes bankrupt. 
  With regard to the fears of Hondutel employees, he said 
those 
who are working efficiently should not worry but noted that "in 
the private sector inefficient workers are fired." 
  He suggested that the privatization process be handled 
openly 
in order to avoid returning to the practice of "state 
enterprises that belong to all Hondurans ending up in the hands 
of a few opportunists." 
  He said some appraisals have been made to determine the sum 
that will be asked for this enterprise, adding that in his 
opinion it needs new management to give it the modern techniques 
demanded by the telecommunications world. In Ferrera's opinion, 
international telecommunications enterprises such as AT&amp;T and 
Motorola will have to participate in the process. He stressed 
that there will be various offers in view of Hondutel's 
profitability, despite its bad administration and a scandalous 
theft that was detected. 
  He added that the profit, more than the result of a good 
administration, is due to the administration's decision to raise 
the tariffs paid by its users. He said that in Hondutel there 
has been "a scandalous theft; when the best mechanisms are not 
used to manage an enterprise, there is corruption; it cannot be 
described any other way." 
  Ferrera said the Armed Forces have been part of that 
corruption. "If any Honduran can show me that there has been no 
corruption in Hondutel's management, I will resign my post as 
finance minister," he stressed. "They (the soldiers) are 
involved in corruption," he said, but noted that just as there 
are corrupt soldiers there are also some honest ones.

<F P=106> [Statement by Carlos Calderon, presidency communications </F>
director, in Tegucigalpa; from the "Morning Paper" 
newscast--live] 
  [Text] I only wanted to refer briefly to Jose Andino's 
statements following an interview with the president. He has 
said a devaluation was being announced. I believe Jose Andino 
did not realize the president said exactly the opposite. When 
asked about this, the president said it was necessary to 
strengthen our currency by increasing our production. He talked 
about increasing exports and improving the production of basic 
grains. This has a dual purpose: to guarantee our food supply 
and to reduce basic grain imports; this obviously strengthens 
our currency. 
  Because this is such a sensitive issue, I felt compelled to 
clarify the issue; in addition, the issue of devaluation has 
been recently mentioned, and I think it is the result of 
confusion or misinterpretation, particularly among the media. 
In fact, I understand what has actually been mentioned, as a 
possibility, is the official implementation of an exchange rate 
that already exists in the market. 
  In any case, if this is done, if it ever occurs, it will be 
the result of a decision adopted by Congress, the body that 
should decide this issue. Consequently....[pauses] I worry 
when the media handle carelessly these topics, which are so 
sensitive to our economy. This could give others wrong ideas, 
something that would be detrimental to us. A devaluation in 
this case is a very serious thing, and the president was quite 
emphatic and clear about that; on the contrary, he said the 
currency should be strengthened, and we should bear this in mind.

  [Editorial Report] San Pedro Sual TIEMPO in Spanish on 4 
March on page 3 reported that the Board of Directors of the 
Central Bank of Honduras, BCH, decided yesterday to reduce 
purchases of foreign currency within the financial system and at 
exchange offices from 30 to 20 percent in an attempt to 
stabilize the price of the dollar. BCH President Hugo Noe Pino 
said the state had been buying 30 percent of the approximately 
$20 million entering the banking system each week but decided to 
reduce such purchases to 20 percent to leave more dollars at the 
disposal of banks and exchange offices to sell to the general 
public and to ensure a more stable exchange rate; this is a 
temporary measure, he added.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Subcommander Marcos, of the </F>
Zapatist National Liberation Army, by Julio Moguel and Hermann 
Bellinghausen in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas State; date 
not given] 
  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas -- "Our expectation is 
that war will be avoided because of the pressure civil society 
from all over the country will exert to force compliance with 
the agreements. I do not think it depends on results of the San 
Cristobal policy. A problem will arise if civil society wears 
down, wearies, or becomes discouraged. In that case, everything 
would come undone, and then they would come down on us with 
military means. What I am trying to explain is we are no 
longer the problem, the country is. Our time is over, even if 
the flashes and photos continue." 
  Subcommander Marcos held a uninhibited and informal 
conversation following the last interviews he granted in San 
Cristobal de las Casas. Visibly tired but with the lively talk 
that distinguishes him, he reviewed the military experience of 
the Zapatist uprising, talked of his first impressions following 
the dialogue, and reflected on the consultation period the EZLN 
[Zapatist National Liberation Army] must now hold in its 
villages. 
  This is the end of an unexpected and surprising phase they 
had not counted on. The insurgent subcommander assessed the 
negotiation's deficiencies for the EZLN as well as the 
government negotiators. He seemed skeptical about the 
commitments and sketched events for the immediate future. Peace 
or war? Increased repression and authoritarianism or effective 
transition toward democracy? The man of a thousand words bade 
farewell to the forum, but before returning to the mountain got 
comfortable in a chair to hold one more talk on the way out. 
  [LA JORNADA] Do you feel more confident now that you are 
returning to the jungle? 
  [Marcos] We were in our element there. When we enter the 
city, that is when we begin to make mistakes. But as long as we 
are in the mountains and villages, it is very unlikely someone 
will pick a fight with us, even the regular forces of the 
federal Army. 
  [LA JORNADA] Are you inviting newsmen to go with you to the 
jungle? What does the invitation consist of? Does this mean 
your camps will no longer be hidden? 
  [Marcos] The idea is not to take you to where the situation 
is delicate. Today, the consultations will be held in the 
civilian sector. We can arrange for some visits, which will 
entail some risk, and these visits, like the previous ones, will 
be made with great security precautions, blindfolding the 
reporters who decide to go. Everyone knows now which zones are 
Zapatist zones. 
  [LA JORNADA] Are you planning to continue the war or do you 
think the negotiations were conducted well? 
  [Marcos] We thought war would follow. On 12 January, we 
prevented the Army from entering and razing the villages by 
drawing them into the jungle or mountains. That is what was 
prevented. We were ready for that kind of combat. We had 
prepared for it for 10 years, not the attacks on San Cristobal 
or the capital cities of the municipalities. During the previous 
nine years we prepared defensively, just defensively. Our 
plans did not and do not call for defining everything through 
armed means. What we thought and planned for was that it was 
more costly to annihilate us in political terms that to tell us 
they would meet all our demands. Only now are they telling us 
what they will give us. This may be a strong investment meant 
more to deprive the EZLN of its social support and justification 
for the war than to solve the problem. The government will have 
to fight its past to convince the villages it will now keep its 
commitments. Why are people going to believe their promises now? 
  Our expectation is that war will be avoided because of the 
pressure civil society from all over the country will exert to 
force compliance with the agreements. I do not think it depends 
on results from the San Cristobal policy. A problem will arise 
if civil society wears down, wearies, or becomes discouraged. 
In that case, everything would come undone, and then they would 
come down on us with military means. What I am trying to 
explain is we are no longer the problem, the country is. Our 
time is over, even if the flashes and photos continue. 
  [LA JORNADA] But you were counting on a war, a long war. 
Did you think there would be strong military clashes? Didn't 
you count on that? 
  [Marcos] We did count on strong military clashes. We 
thought the strongest military clash would take place in San 
Cristobal. We thought military reaction would be immediate to 
prevent further revolts. We knew they would not hesitate. That 
is why we concentrated our strongest forces here with the idea 
of holding back the Army. Our largest military concentration was 
near Rancho Nuevo, on the road to Tuxtla. 
  We knew there would be strong clashes when we saw that 
municipal capitals were not falling simultaneously. We occupied 
San Cristobal and we realized that we were alone; we realized 
that the other municipal capitals had not fallen. The attacks 
on Altamirano and Ocosingo did not take place until 0700, and 
the situation was not militarily resolved until 1600. In Las 
Margaritas we began at 0300 and it fell in an hour. Here we 
begin at 0100 and by 0200 we already had the city occupied. We, 
therefore, decided to take our time in San Cristobal in order to 
stop and bog down the Army. We wanted enough time for an 
orderly retreat while we found out what was going on and carried 
out actions of armed propaganda [accion de propaganda armada]. 
We later carried out the attack on Rancho Nuevo to recover 
weapons and the park. That is where we failed unfortunately. 
We lost men and we had to flee in disarray. That disorganized 
an entire column, the one between San Cristobal and Rancho 
Nuevo, and it also disorganized the one between Altamirano and 
San Cristobal. 
  I repeat that we did not know very well what was going on. 
The quick manner in which we went from the armed confrontation 
to the table in San Cristobal took us by surprise. We had 
already said that our delay in organizing ourselves to reach the 
peace table was precisely because we did not expect it to be so 
soon. 
  [LA JORNADA] If the way the events developed took you by 
surprise and you had to improvise or discuss the change of 
course along the way, are you now prepared to discuss the terms 
for an agreement in the jungle in such a short period of time? 
  [Marcos] There is not and there will not be any 
improvisation 
in the discussion of the agreements because that is something we 
know how to do. That is how we decided to wage the war. I am 
going to tell you something. We first started to listen to some 
voices who said they could not take it any longer. The groups 
that announced they would go to war alone appeared later. The 
General Command begin to detect this situation and analyze it 
and they decide to consult. The analysis of the pros and cons 
of initiating an uprising is then organized bearing in mind 
circumstances such as NAFTA, the collapse of the socialist bloc, 
and events in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. On the 
other hand we took at look at the deaths and the poverty, the 
increase in the infant mortality rate, the suspension of the 
distribution of agricultural lands by the reforms to Article 27, 
and the delegations that went to seek resources and only 
returned with a bunch of papers. 
  The General Command explained it to the ethnic committees; 
the ethnic committees explained it in turn to the regional 
committees; the regional committees explained it to the local 
committees -- which are located in each village -- and they in 
turn explained it to the community. They discussed the pros and 
cons until the community itself decided it was time to take a 
vote. The number of yes and no votes were counted without 
regard for age or sex. The reverse process then started: The 
locals submitted their resolutions to the regional committees; 
the regional committees submitted them to the zones; the zones 
submitted them to the ethnic committees; and the ethnic 
committees submitted them to the General Command. That was when 
it appeared to us we were watching another television channel. 
While we thought they would say no, just when we thought 
everything at the international level was against us, just when 
we thought the military action would be annulled as a result, it 
turned out that the immense majority voted yes. Just a handful 
of our fellow companeros said the time was not right. 
  [LA JORNADA] You said before that in order to reach 
agreements at the table in San Cristobal something more than 
willingness from the parties was needed. You stated that it 
would only be possible to obtain the Zapatist demands with the 
support -- or the contribution -- of civil society. Can you 
explain this idea better? 
  [Marcos] The government will only fulfill its promises if it 
is forced to do so, and this will be achieved through the force 
of rifles or the pressure of society. Betting on that pressure 
taking place is the appropriate path. The only possibility to 
attain peace we see now is for other forces to commit themselves 
to forcing the government to comply. The result of that bet is 
this consultation process. It does not depend on what the 
government does but what the rest of the country does. 
  We have received many letters recommending a process of 
change. First we received some surprising letters from some 
people who said everything looked pretty but they were going to 
beat us up. Then came the letters saying that we should seek 
the path of peace, the path of negotiation, so that we do not 
let ourselves be killed. The third stage was when they told us 
-- and they are still telling us -- that we should not surrender 
our weapons, sell out, or yield to their demands. Solidarity 
committees are being formed to support not only the Chiapas 
people, but the EZLN. We receive support from many sectors, 
particularly Indian groups. You must recall the letter sent to 
us by the demonstrators in Guerrero State, but we have also 
received letters from the Yaquis, Mayos, Tarahuamaras, the Mayas 
of Yucatan and Campeche, from Colima, Puebla... 
  We did not place ourselves at the head of this movement, 
rather, we placed ourselves at the back. Now any other movement 
has more chances than we do, because they can say: They are the 
radicals; I want the same that they have and if you do not 
comply, I am going to go radical. Now the field for that is 
opening up and we said: Go ahead, yes; go for it! But we do not 
see ourselves as victims, because we are going to get something 
for our dead -- not more deaths but benefits for Indians in 
general and the state in particular. Now the danger is that the 
movement may become satisfied with what it will get at the local 
level and not aspire to contribute to a national movement. 
  [LA JORNADA] In the document that resulted from the 
conversations between you and the peace commissioner in San 
Cristobal, some of the demands made by the EZLN at the federal 
level did not receive a satisfactory response, such as the 
reforms to Article 27 or the constitutional quarter [cuarto 
constitucional]. But from reading the document the first time, 
it appears that you obtained some things that, although they 
have not been formally accepted, may exert pressure to reform 
significant portions of the Constitution or, if the comparison 
is allowed, you got things too big for the current legal and 
institutional framework. 
  [Marcos] There are answers that do not respond formally to 
some of those national demands, but that opens the door for the 
development of a national movement that could break or modify 
the current constitutional framework. They did not answer, for 
instance, the demand for the reform of Article 27, but the 
concessions made make its reform possible with the support of 
other sectors and movements with similar demands and using other 
means. These groups may ultimately reform said article before 
this six-year term expires or beginning with the new government. 
  According to what we have analyzed and the consultations we 
have had with lawyers, San Cristobal begins to necessarily 
establish the need for a national negotiating table, a national 
dialogue, where forces other than us also take part. 
  In any case, if they are unable to meet our demands promptly 
and clearly it is because they must maintain the principle of 
authority, under the premise they have no reason to make 
concessions. The neoliberal project can no longer be defended. 
  [LA JORNADA] Your group was very lucky because you were not 
discovered. How was that possible? 
  [Marcos] The government initially thought we were not a 
guerrilla group. It said we would have attacked if we were 
guerrillas because no guerrilla group gets ready first, grows, 
and only attacks much later. It later thought we were 
Guatemalans, URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] 
support groups, or other things, such as a group attempting to 
seize land. The information that they had at the time did not 
correspond to that in Sedena's [National Defense Secretariat] 
computer or at the Interior Secretariat, if the latter still 
kept this information secret. [sentence as published] 
  Since 1985 we thought we were going to be discovered. We 
maintained a defensive military program at the time because we 
expected to be discovered. We had grown too much. Entire 
communities knew about us, helped us carry the responsibility, 
and fed us. 
  [LA JORNADA] What question would you like to hear? What has 
nobody asked and you would like to hear? 
  [Marcos] I would ask: What are the Zapatists going to do if 
one or the other alternative is chosen? What will they do if 
people say no to peace and yes to war? What will they do if 
people say yes to peace and no to war? What are they going to 
do with their military units and their fighting experts in one 
case or the other? 
  If the option were to be peace, we would not fight because 
our army is made up of peasants. Entry to civilian life would 
be almost natural. We, however, would not surrender our 
weapons; we need to be able to defend ourselves if we are 
threatened. 
  In any case, if peace wins we would have to remain as an 
army 
for a long time to make sure the agreements are kept. The 
problem is: How will we relate to power during this period? 
This is the power we confronted and, in one way or another, its 
objective was to annihilate us, that is, to take away our social 
base, invalidate our prestige, and annihilate us at the lowest 
political cost. 
  [LA JORNADA] What will happen with the cattlemen if the 
peace 
proposal advances and the Zapatists' demands are met? 
  [Marcos] I believe they will have to be sacrificed. If the 
government wants to reach an agreement, it will have to 
sacrifice them. Maybe the cattlemen will decide to placate the 
situation and sacrifice a few of their own, those in other 
territories, so that others are not touched. This is what is 
going to happen in Altamirano, Ocosingo, and Las Margaritas, 
where the conflict took place. 
  The situation there is similar to the one in San Juan 
Chamula. The San Juan Chamula political machine is promoted by 
the state in exchange for votes. To secure votes they started 
giving them more power and this has led to the situation we know 
now. It has reached a point where the government cannot touch 
the bosses now. Governors come and go at a very high social 
cost and the government cannot touch them. Perhaps they are not 
aware of the monster they have created. The case is similar to 
the one of the cattlemen. They gave them weapons and training 
in exchange for money and protected them when they committed 
outrages. 
  The government knew this. Just as it discovered our training 
camps in 1993, it knew about them at least since 1990. They 
knew the cattlemen were armed and training. The government's 
officers were the ones who gave them the training at the white 
guard training camps, at the Castellanos ranches, and at the 
Altamirano Municipal Auditorium. 
  Our military hypothesis is the following: A bullring called 
Lancandona Jungle is established. The federal government and 
the Army stay at the bullring's refuge section, civil society is 
up on the tiers, we are the bullfighter, and the cattlemen are 
the bull. The government says: Let them tear each other up and 
I will pick up the remains. The Army, which is a human rights 
transgressor, then becomes a pacifying army and implements 
order. This is a likely situation which, in military terms, 
depicts the blocking of the Ricardo Pozas caravan, the present 
lynch mood, and the Army that did nothing. 
  The cattlemen are already out of control. We threatened 
several times to break off the talks because of the events at 
Altamirano and the government was unable to control them. The 
cattlemen were attempting to break up the talks. 
  [LA JORNADA] What will happen in Altamirano? Will things 
break off? What will happen if this confrontation scheme 
spreads to other parts of the country? 
  [Marcos] It seems this will also an issue for the cattle 
ranchers [ganaderas]. We will see what kind of support the 
cattlemen have. If these guys have the cattle ranchers' support, 
then it will all be worthless because they will go from being 
murderers to martyrs of the small properties cause. If other 
cattle ranchers start to make noise about this, they will create 
opposition. It is the state's responsibility, however. The state 
is also responsible for what happened on 1 January because they 
were warned this would happen. There were demands for reform. 
Now, they are being told this will happen, that doors should be 
left open. 
  [LA JORNADA] If this was the government's response, what do 
you think of Camacho's response or attitude? 
  [Marcos] Camacho discovered that the leadership of this 
movement is actually Indian. It was a big surprise for them to 
have to deal with the interlocutors and not the forces that were 
supposedly behind it. That is when the world opened up to them, 
when Camacho said there is a solution to this, even if they are 
wearing ski caps, and foreign forces are not involved. 
  [LA JORNADA] One of your achievements at the San Cristobal 
table is the creation of conditions for clean and democratic 
elections in Chiapas. If this becomes a reality, would the EZLN 
participate in any way, as a force with its own candidates in 
the electoral process? 
  [Marcos] We will not do that. We lack the necessary 
organizational structure. We would frown on any of our members 
who did that. For example, all chiefs are banned from occupying 
public office under the threat of expulsion. They must not own 
property either. Moreover, the EZLN seeks to have its demands 
met strictly through military means [militar reivindicativa]. 
We would also need experienced cadres in the open struggle, in 
the struggle of the masses. We have the ability to organize 
into communities to survive, to maintain ourselves, but not in 
the public spotlight because we lack experience. This is where 
they can confuse and mess us up. 
  [LA JORNADA] But the EZLN, with the sympathy you generated, 
could the EZLN not influence the nomination of municipal 
presidents? Is it not part of your goals, to influence the 
appointment of democratic authorities? 
  [Marcos] That is undoubtedly one of our goals. That is 
definitely close to the reality of the rural areas because all 
the state's rural territory is ours. I, however, see this more 
as supporting someone else's nomination or candidacy rather than 
launching one of our own because otherwise we would loose 
prestige, moral authority, and social base.

<F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Otero from the "ACIR Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Excerpts] The timetable and responsibilities of each 
government entity to implement the agreements reached during the 
peace talks held in Chiapas State were established today, 
Friday, at the official Los Pinos residence. President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari and Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for 
peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, read each one of the 32 
resolutions of the San Cristobal table. Plainly speaking, the 
work was parceled out, Camacho Solis explained at an interview 
held after he left this meeting, which was also attended by 
secretaries of education, health, agriculture and hydraulic 
resources, social development, government, and finance and 
public credit. As Camacho reported it, the president has given 
instructions that the agreements made by the government in this 
pacification process be faithfully complied with. This private 
meeting lasted approximately two and one-half hours. The 
secretaries left Los Pinos one by one, but did not make any 
statements. Camacho drove out and got out of his car, which was 
surrounded by about 50 reporters, photographers, and cameramen 
who were waiting for him to explain what had happened at the 
meeting. [passage omitted] 
  He also made a very interesting comment when asked how the 
negotiation problem was going; he said one must not look at this 
matter as a problem. Let us listen to his answer to this 
question. 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] This is not a negotiation 
problem because we are not even talking of negotiation. We are 
talking about a dialogue. This is something I would like to tell 
you and the citizens of Mexicans, through you. Instead of 
regarding this as a problem, let us look at it as an occasion to 
provide better political, economic, and social solutions to a 
reality as complex as Chiapas. The more we have of this.... 
[pauses] The better we keep our commitments and the greater our 
seriousness is during the whole process, the more positive it 
will be. This is not a problem of giving and taking. This is a 
problem of raising to the social and political circumstances and 
of clearly understanding that some things need a different 
approach. Therefore, we are not talking about money but of 
reforms, institutional changes, coordination, and most of all, a 
republican attitude, which entails two things, namely, 
acknowledging problems and meeting with the people so we can 
provide government solutions based on that reality. [end 
recording] [passage omitted] 
  I think the interview was interesting. He was very 
courteous, 
as always. He tried to answer all the questions. Of course, some 
[pause] He noted: I have been asked, through different means, 
what my political future will be, but I will not speak of 
politics now, nor will I speak of my aspirations or personal 
life. I have a major responsibility. 
  To conclude, he has always been willing to answer the 
reporters' questions. He was that way today. He also indicated 
there had been false reports that Article 27 of the Constitution 
would be amended. He affirmed that this Article will not be 
amended. He mentioned two points that were discussed with the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]. One has to do with the 
possibility of submitting a bill on Indian communities rights, 
which will touch on some aspects dealing with land. The other is 
the possibility of enacting an agrarian justice law. This would 
be a state law based on Article 27, which is in force. During 
talks with the EZLN, there was no mention of amending this 
article, as some news media have reported.

  [Text] Mexico City, 5 Mar (EFE) -- Today some 100 members 
of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) partially burned 
the municipal palace at Teoloyucan, 50 km north of the Mexican 
capital, to demand the dismissal of Mayor Pedro Zenteno, who 
belongs to the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution 
(PRD). 
  The PRI members have gathered at the central plaza and are 
armed with sticks and stones under the surveillance of the 
police who have not intervened up until now, according to 
sources from the municipality of Teoloyucan, which has a 
population of 52,000. 
  Pedro Zenteno, the municipal mayor of Teoloyucan, told EFE 
that the municipal palace was looted, some windows were 
shattered, and part of the building was set on fire by the PRI 
members. 
  Zenteno was appointed municipal mayor of Teoloyucan by the 
Congress of the State of Mexico on 25 January, after 
participating in the municipal elections on 14 November. 
  The PRD leader in the state of Mexico, Gerardo Fernandez 
Norona, told EFE that the situation in Teoloyucan "is delicate" 
because the state government "has had difficulties in enforcing 
the decisions of the congress." We know that "behind the group 
of PRI members are strong interests and chieftains, who have 
even clashed with Mexico State Governor Emilio Chuayffet Chemor. 
  The PRI spokesman in the state of Mexico, Eleazar Flores 
Arriaga, told EFE: "We know there is a group of people who are 
unhappy with the acting mayor; we do not know if they are PRI 
members. I could not say for sure." He denied that the municipal 
palace was burned and said a fire only broke out in the attic, 
where a group of persons looted some offices.

  [Text] Mario Saucedo, secretary general of the Democratic 
Revolution Party [PRD], yesterday denied that he was an adviser 
of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) and of rebel 
Subcommander Marcos. He also denied that his party is linked 
with that organization. 
  Through a communique sent to this office, Saucedo maintained 
that the reason for statements pointing to "my alleged 
participation in the Drive for Peace and Reconciliation in 
Chiapas established by the EZLN, Bishop Samuel Ruiz, and Manuel 
Camacho" is to distort my work and the political positions of my 
work. 
  He emphasized that to say that within the framework of the 
two negotiations -- the EZLN-government talks and the 
negotiation between various political parties with the 
government to reach a consensus for electoral reforms as a 
condition for social peace -- is grave because it would affect 
the right environment for the dialogue. 
  I want to express, Saucedo said, my total rejection of such 
statements because I have never, neither now nor in the past, 
wanted to give advice to the EZLN or Subcommander Marcos. I 
have only been an observer. 
  In conclusion, he explained that it must not be forgotten 
that the PRD is a national force on the verge of attaining the 
government and that is the reason for our interest in the peace 
negotiations in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. "Nothing 
will change our communication and commitment with the people of 
Chiapas, the EZLN, and the country." 
  Meanwhile, the PRD Office of the Federal District, headed by 
Rene Bejarano Martinez, presented charges to the Federal 
District's Human Rights Commission that a couple of PRD members 
were kidnapped by the National Defense Secretariat within the 
framework of an event called "The 100 Marches for Democracy" 
held on 24 February.

  [Text] Mexico City, 1 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Mexican Foreign 
Secretary Manuel Tello Macias asserted today that dialogue and 
negotiations among countries are essential to confronting the 
challenges and threats that endanger international stability and 
security. He emphasized that the world faces new challenges and 
threats to its stability and security following the era of 
political-ideological confrontation. Speaking at the 
inauguration of the 10th Mexican-Canadian Ministerial Commission 
meeting here, Tello asserted that cooperation among countries 
must be increased, justice among nations augmented, and 
international institutions strengthened. The Mexican foreign 
secretary said that Mexico and Canada have significant points of 
agreement that have allowed more solid and profound bilateral 
relations. Tello asserted that as the world has become more 
independent, nations are intermingling more, new economic spaces 
are being created, and competition for markets and positions in 
the global economy is increasing. For this reason, scientific 
and technological developments force firms and governments to 
propose efficient solutions that acknowledge the needs of 
growing competitiveness. 
  He emphasized that NAFTA has increased and broadened 
Mexican- 
Canadian interaction and has caused bilateral relations to 
become significantly closer and more familiar. The foreign 
secretary said the agenda of the 10th meeting, which ends this 
afternoon, shows the richness of the countries' relations as it 
includes issues related to commerce, finance, agriculture, 
transportation, mining, forestry, fisheries, and labors. 
  Regarding politics, the dialogue goes beyond the bilateral 
field and includes aspects related to the operations and goals 
of institutions such as the United Nations, the OAS, the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation mechanism. 
  Canadian Foreign Minister Andres Ouellet pointed out the 
importance of the countries' bilateral relations based on mutual 
respect and agreement on goals to bring peace and respect to 
every country. He added that NAFTA has prompted great 
international interest as well as curiosity in European and 
Asian countries, but "for us, it is a new relationship that we 
must intensify, mature, and fully experience." 
  He mentioned the possibility of Latin American countries 
such 
as Chile joining the commercial agreement and added that 
countries in the hemisphere should seek wider membership. 
  The Canadian minister explained that the meeting will 
include 
issues related to the export of Canadian equipment and minerals 
and tele-exploration [teledeteccion] technology, as well as 
access to the market of Mexican firms such as Mexican Petroleum 
and the Federal Electricity Company. 
  Ouellet said NAFTA increases Mexico's and Canada's prospects 
for sustained economic growth and said that both governments 
will respect the other's priorities regarding labor and 
environmental issues. 
  The delegates to the 10th Ministerial Commission meeting 
will 
study bilateral relations and cooperation mechanisms in various 
sectors of common interest.

  [Text] Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello closed the 10th 
Mexican-Canadian Ministerial Meeting in Mexico City. The 
Canadian ministers and the Mexican secretaries and deputy 
secretaries comprised four groups that analyzed the possibility 
of bilateral cooperation in the transportation, agriculture, 
environment, and commerce sectors. 
  Mexican Communications and Transportation Secretary Emilio 
Gamboa and Canadian Transportation Minister Douglas Young signed 
three transportation agreements that will allow reciprocal entry 
to drivers who carry products; the bilateral recognition of 
commercial drivers' licenses; and technical cooperation in 
training programs. 
  Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet and Secretary Manuel 
Tello discussed regional and global politics. The Canadian 
foreign minister termed as surprising the efforts exerted to 
make the process as democratic as possible and said Canada 
believes in the political and social future of Mexico. Minister 
Ouellet also referred to the Chiapas conflict. He said Canada 
supports the actions carried out by the Mexican Government and 
encourages President Salinas de Gortari to continue along the 
same path. The Canadian foreign minister and Secretary Tello 
supported Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's candidacy for OAS 
secretary general Secretariat and they reasserted their support 
for the lifting of the blockade in Cuba. 
  The next ministerial meeting will be held in Canada in 1995.

<F P=106> [Report by Lucia Domville] </F>
  [Text] Mexican Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello and Canadian 
Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet have agreed to grant more access 
to agricultural products and to increase bilateral trade in 
cereals, beef, cattle, and agricultural food products. 
  In the transportation sector the two governments' 
representatives agreed to grant reciprocal access to trucks and 
trailers so they may use the facilities and terminals in each 
country. Tello and Ouellet recognized commercial drivers' 
licenses and reached an agreement on technical cooperation in 
the transportation sector. 
  Minister Ouellet said the conflict in Chiapas will not 
prevent an increase in the flow of Canadian investments in 
Mexico. 
  Four topics were discussed within the framework of the 10th 
Mexico-Canada Ministerial Meeting: politics, trade, 
transportation, and the agrarian-livestock sector. 
  Regarding trade issues, the government representatives 
explored ways to increase the potential of an exchange in assets 
within the NAFTA negotiations. The Canadian foreign minister 
said his government intends to increase the trade of cereals, 
beef, cattle, agricultural products, canned fruits, and other 
agricultural food products. Canada exported $771 million to 
Mexico in 1992. This represents 37 percent of that country's 
sales abroad. This figure would increase to surpass the 
$1-billion mark if shipments are included. The export of 
Canadian manufactured products to Mexico increased almost 15 
percent that year. 
  Bilateral trade will substantially increase once NAFTA is 
implemented. Canada has launched the "Access to North America" 
initiative, a trade development program worth $27 million. 
Ouellet said his government intends to promote trade with small 
and medium- sized Canadian enterprises in the market 
opportunities given to that country. Telecommunications, 
plastics, machinery, tools, and metal engraving tool companies 
operate in Mexico. The same goes for agricultural and 
industrial products, particularly processed food and similar 
high-quality products, a significant opportunity that the 
Mexican market has granted Canadian companies. 
  Regarding the transportation sector, Communications 
Ministers 
Douglas Young and Emilio Gamboa signed three memoranda of 
agreement to strengthen relations between Canada and Mexico and, 
consequently, expedite the flow of merchandise. Young explained 
that the three memoranda of agreement called for technical 
cooperation in the transportation sector, where Canada offers 
great advantages to Mexican transportation companies; reciprocal 
access to trucks and trailers for circulation in the two 
countries; and, he recognized, the use of Mexican commercial 
driving licenses in Canada. 
  Referring to political issues, Ouellet said they discussed 
the situation at the national, regional, and world level. On 
the national level they reviewed the problem in Chiapas and he 
reviewed reports on those events, and the operation to solve the 
conflict. The Canadian foreign minister said his country's 
investments will not be negatively affected by an internal 
conflict because President Carlos Salinas de Gortari guaranteed 
it is a local problem that will be peacefully solved, and human 
rights will be fully respected. 
  The foreign minister said he will take a report from the 
National Human Rights Commission, led by Jorge Madrazo, back to 
his country so his government may have firsthand knowledge of 
the causes and ways to settle the conflict. 
  Moreover, Manuel Tello said the agreements signed within 
this 
bilateral framework will strengthen relations between the two 
countries; and he said the cultural and education exchange will 
be particularly intensified. 
  At the end of the meeting Tello accepted holding the 11th 
ministerial meeting in Canada in 1995.

  [Text] Mexico and Canada believe "it is time to turn the 
page on the Cuban case," and lift the economic blockade without 
any preset political conditions. At the conclusion of the 
bilateral meeting between both nations, their foreign ministers 
pointed out that "as of today, the process to influence the U.S. 
decision to lift the blockade," in the short term, "could be 
initiated." 
  At the meeting chaired by Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello and 
his Canadian colleague, Andre Quellet, the latter expressed his 
government's interest in the Chiapas incidents -- particularly 
those that have to do with human rights -- and the process of 
political and electoral democratization. He also said: "Canada 
has always been interested in these matters, as a friend, and 
following the initiation of NAFTA, we are also interested as 
partners." 
  Quellet had the opportunity to discuss both issues during 
the 
meeting as well as at an afternoon meeting with President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari at Los Pinos. There he manifested his 
acknowledgement of the open and peaceful manner in which the 
Mexican Government has handled such a difficult problem while he 
"encouraged" the Mexican authorities to "continue on the road of 
negotiations already started." 
  At the conclusion of the meeting -- which included five 
members of the Canadian Cabinet, as well as Carlos Hank Gonzalez 
and Emilio Gamboa Patron, secretaries of agriculture and 
hydraulic resources and of communications and transportation, 
respectively -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretian's visit 
was announced for 23-25 March. This will be the first bilateral 
visit by that official to a nation in the Western Hemisphere 
since he took office several months ago. 
  Tello announced at the start of the meeting that the 
political geography of our region has determined that Mexico and 
Canada pass from the category of "distant friends" to "strategic 
partners." Together with the United States, he indicated, we 
will form the most important economy and trade area in the world. 
  During a news conference both foreign ministers took up the 
Cuban issue. The Canadian said, we think that the situation on 
the island is more difficult every day for the people who no 
longer receive aid from the former Soviet Union or from the 
former socialist bloc nations. Mexico and Canada, Quellet 
added, continue their cooperation in the health sector and in 
food supply to help mitigate the situation as much as possible. 
In our opinion, however, the trade blockade must be solved by 
the United States. 
  Quellet emphasized that both nations have maintained their 
ties with Cuba and "the time has come" for that nation's 
rapprochement with the United States. He gave as an example 
that "former enemies" such as Washington and Moscow have 
overcome their problems and now their relations are on another 
level. He remarked that the same way the United States "turned 
around" the Vietnam problem and they normalized their relations 
with China, it is now also time to lift the economic blockade of 
Cuba. 
  Tello indicated that only Canada and Mexico have maintained 
relations with the Caribbean nation after it was ousted from the 
OAS while both nations have voted at international forums in 
favor of ending the embargo against Havana. 
  Canada and Mexico, Tello stressed, do not accept that a 
third 
nation regulate the manner in which they realize their trade 
relations. Tello was asked: "Some nations speak out in favor of 
Cuba but they condition it to its `democratization.' What is 
your opinion?" "We do not condition our position on anything," 
Tello replied. 
  Meanwhile, the Canadian minister made official his country 
and Mexico's support for Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's 
candidacy as OAS general secretary. 
  During his speech delivered in the morning, Quellet 
explained 
that his nation's main foreign policy goals are to consolidate 
and strengthen democracy and to protect human rights. On these 
issues, he remarked he was greatly impressed by the Mexican 
Government's efforts to guarantee credibility and transparency 
in the August presidential elections. 
  With regard to the human rights issue, Quellet said he had 
met with the Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, president of the National 
Human Rights Commission [CNDH], with whom he discussed the 
Chiapas problem. Madrazo Cuellar handed over the report the 
Commission recently published on the incidents in Chiapas. 
Quellet said: It is a very thorough report which we will 
widely disseminate in Canada. In addition, he announced that 
the CNDH president had been officially invited to visit his 
country shortly. 
  Among the agreements reached in this 10th Bilateral 
Mexico-Canada Meeting, stand out the signing of three memoranda 
between Mexico's Secretariat of Communications and 
Transportation and Canada's Transportation Ministry with regard 
to trailer trucks border access, the mutual acceptance of 
federal driver's license, and of technical training. 
  The participants reconfirmed the importance of strengthening 
this mechanism of consultation and analysis that allows -- in an 
overall fashion -- the taking up of the main issues on the 
bilateral agenda while they agreed to meet in Canada next year.

  [Text] Mexico City, 4 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Mexican Commerce 
Secretary Jaime Serra Puche referred to the free trade agreement 
with Costa Rica, whose negotiation will conclude this week, as 
"the most advanced in Latin America." Serra Puche argued that 
the agreement not only includes goods but also services, 
copyrights and investments, dispute settlement procedures, and 
government purchases." [no beginning quotation mark as received] 
  Mexico and Costa Rica trade goods and services for some $80 
million a year. Serra Puche believes that the treaty negotiated 
with Costa Rica, which will come into force on 1 January 1995, 
could become a very useful guideline for negotiations with other 
Central American countries. He pointed out that talks with 
Central America will continue, but they "will not be conducted 
as a bloc." Therefore, there will be separate negotiations with 
Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and later with Nicaragua. 
  Serra Puche announced that trade negotiations with the Group 
of Three -- Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia -- might resume in 
March.

  [Editorial Report] Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish on 
4 March carries a 725-word report by Eva Lozano Estrella 
entitled "Pemex [Mexican Petroleum] Postpones Sale of 
Petrochemical Plants Due to Crisis in Sector." 
  The report begins by saying that "Pemex announced on 3 March 
that the drop in the price of hydrocarbons on the international 
market does not create the right conditions for the federal 
government to place pretrochemical plants on sale this year." 
  The report adds that "Pemex believes in 1994 the oil sector 
in general will experience the worst period in recent history 
and predicts that both prices and profitability in the sector 
could be even lower due to the high surplus already in existence 
in international supplies, which will lower the final value of 
plants." 
  Therefore, the report notes, "the government has decided 
that 
the privatization of the state-run petrochemical industry will 
be the responsibility of the next government, as an increase in 
the price of goods and services is expected by 1995." 
  After analyzing possible strategies Pemex could follow to 
improve its financial situation, the article says government 
officials have said "investments in the petrochemical sector 
will continue normally," adding that "investments along the 
lines of 135 million new pesos are planned this year, part of 
which will be channeled to strategic projects." 
  Finally, the report cites official sources saying that "an 
increase in the import of petrochemical products reflects a 
tendency in world trade, as countries like Germany, the United 
States, Japan, and France have become large importers even 
though they are also the largest producers."

  [Text] Oscar Eid Franco, president of the Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left [MIR], this morning reported an attempt to 
abduct and arrest former Susana Seleme, former President Jaime 
Paz Zamora's private secretary. 
  Eid Franco also confirmed that former President Paz Zamora 
testified as a witness before the military court in Tarija in 
connection with the TAB [Bolivian Transportation Airline] case 
on the alleged irregular purchase of five aircraft during his 
government. 
  [Begin Eid recording] I want to confirm that at 1700 on 3 
March at his residence (?El Picacho), Jaime Paz Zamora was 
questioned as a witness by the Supreme Military Court regarding 
the TAB case. This legal procedure was fulfilled on 3 March and 
the Military Court already has the necessary information at hand. 
  I also would like to protest and report the attempt to 
abduct 
and arrest fellow partisan Susana Seleme on 3 March in Santa 
Cruz, a procedure that fully violates our laws. We regret this 
sort of thing happening in democracy, especially because we 
already have asked Congress to carry out an investigation. 
Therefore, these procedures only mar the image of our 
organization because the only information valid for the adoption 
of legal measures then will be from an investigation. [end

  [Text] La Paz, 4 Mar (EFE) -- The private secretary of 
former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora today denied to EFE 
that she had been arrested by Special Antinarcotics Force 
(FELCN) members. 
  During a telephone conversation with EFE, Susana Seleme said 
from her home in Santa Cruz, 851 km east of La Paz, that she had 
never been arrested and that the FELCN had not summoned her to 
testify. 
  Radio Panamericana of La Paz today said that Seleme had been 
arrested for alleged links with drug trafficking. 
  Interior Minister German Quiroga did not want either to 
confirm or deny the arrest of Seleme because, he said, it is 
"confidential information." 
  In statements to Radio Panamericana, Quiroga also did not 
confirm or deny that an arrest warrant has been issued against 
other leaders in Paz Zamora's party, the Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left (MIR).

  [Text] La Paz, 4 Mar (EFE) -- Susana Seleme, private 
secretary to former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora, today 
reported that police agents attempted to kidnap her in Santa 
Cruz, and that by mistake they arrested and held for several 
hours her niece, Luisa Rodriguez. 
  Seleme's niece confirmed that on 3 March she was detained by 
a group of individuals, apparently policemen, who detained her 
for several hours while they questioned her about her aunt. 
  A Bolivian radio station today reported that Susana Seleme 
had been arrested for alleged links with drug trafficking. 
Interior Minister German Quiroga did not want to either confirm 
or deny this report, and Seleme herself denied to EFE in a 
telephone conversation from her home that she had been arrested. 
  Susana Seleme, together with some leaders of her party, the 
Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), denounced before 
District Attorney Francisco Borenstein the kidnapping of her 
niece by a group of six armed men, and accused the antinarcotics 
police and the U.S. DEA of political harassment. 
  Seleme said she feels harassed by the U.S. Embassy in La Paz 
over her old and excellent relations with the Cuban Government, 
and especially with Fidel Castro. 
  Sources from the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) 
consulted by EFE in La Paz said that no orders had been issued 
to carry out an operation like the one described by Seleme, 
because any such procedure -- that is, an arrest -- is always 
carried out within the law. 
  Other FELCN sources said that the role of the DEA is 
restricted to logistical support and the processing of 
information obtained from drug enforcement operations. The 
sources said DEA agents do not participate in this kind of 
operations, in compliance with bilateral agreements signed 
between Bolivia and the United States. 
  Drug trafficker Carmelo "Meco" Dominguez testified before a 
dangerous substances judge in La Paz that Susana Seleme 
allegedly protected drug traffickers. 
  Dominguez said that the MIR leadership met on several 
occasions with Isaac "Oso" Chavarria, allegedly the greatest 
drug trafficker in Bolivia, who was arrested last January by the 
FELCN, to discuss the financing of Paz Zamora's party campaign. 
  Susana Seleme's niece today told EFE that during the 
afternoon of 3 March she left Seleme's house in Santa Cruz and 
got into a "radio-taxi," which was intercepted fewer than 100 
meters from where she got into it by three vehicles, from which 
six armed men emerged. 
  "They told me: Get out, Susana Seleme. I took off my 
sunglasses and told them that I was not Susana," Luisa Rodriguez 
said, adding that although the men did not show their 
identification cards they said they belong to the FELCN. 
  The men, Rodriguez said, got into the "radio-taxi," ordered 
the driver not to communicate with his central radio system, and 
then began to question Rodriguez. 
  Meanwhile, given that Luisa Rodriguez was taking a long time 
to arrive at her destination, Susana Seleme called the 
"radio-taxi" central, which with the aid of other taxis quickly 
found Rodriguez' car, Seleme said. 
  Susana Seleme asked District Attorney Borenstein to 
accompany 
her to the place together with a police patrol, where they 
arrived a little while after the men returned her identification 
documents to her niece and told her that they had nothing 
against her or her aunt.

  [Excerpts] Minister of Government German Quiroga stated 
that the majority of people support the government and the 
success of the strike in La Paz was the result of the scare 
provoked by the Civic Committee. 
  Quiroga had to admit the La Paz Civic Committee's power and 
the extent of the strike: 
  [Begin Quiroga recording] Services have been reduced because 
of the pressures and the vehicles that blocked the streets. We 
have stated that the strike has thus begun and that it continued 
to increase. Approximately 70 percent of the banks opened but 
all of them are now closed because of the pressures by the Civic 
Committee brigades. The same thing occurred with transportation 
in the Achachicala and Vino Tinto areas, where public buses were 
stoned and microbus windows broken. The bus owners, obviously, 
decided to suspend services. 
  Markets on Buenos Aires Avenue and even on Bilinquentes 
Comunes Street were looted in the name of the Civic Committee. 
Such actions by criminals caused fear, and the city of La Paz 
probably will be completely paralyzed this afternoon. [end 
recording] 
  Quiroga said the La Paz Civic Committee did not have to 
declare this strike: 
  [Begin Quiroga recording] All the points proposed to the 
government by the Civic Committee have been positively answered, 
including the budget issue. They asked the government not to 
reduce the department's budget. La Paz Department's total budget 
was increased more than 8 million bolivianos under a system of 
equal participation for the number of people in the department 
in order to match the revenues of the cities with those of the 
rural areas. This was explained in detail to La Paz Civic 
Committee President Freire, but he stated that it was not 
possible to suspend the strike at the time this was explained, 
that is, at 8 p.m. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  Quiroga concluded by saying that no confrontations occurred 
in La Paz, and civic strikes were not observed in Beni and Pando 
Departments.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Respecting International Regulations"] </F>
  [Text] The comprehensive news reports on the approval of 
the Social Emergency Fund (FSE) and the creation of the Real 
Value Unit (URV) overshadowed the announcement of the decision 
last week by U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor to not 
recommend imposing sanctions against Brazil for still not having 
a law on the protection of industrial property satisfactory to 
Washington's demands. It would not, however, be an exaggeration 
to say that this decision is very important to the Brazilian 
economy because it eliminates a threat that could strain our 
relationship with the United States. 
  The much-talked-about lack of international credibility 
Brazil enjoys for not fulfilling its promises was denied in a 
note issued by Kantor, who not only recognized but also praised 
the Brazilian Government's efforts to modernize its patents law. 
Contrary to what many believed -- this daily among them -- 
President Bill Clinton's administration showed signs of 
understanding the reform process Brazil is experiencing, within 
a democratic framework, to be able to regain its place in the 
world market. In fact, it would not only be unfair but also 
politically inadvisable to impose retaliatory measures against 
Brazil precisely when it is trying, in the midst of all sorts of 
obstacles, to open its economy. 
  As is obvious, the U.S. decision is the result of an 
intensive nine-month negotiation. There were times when it 
seemed impossible that the United States would not resort to the 
so-called Super 301 trade law to force Brazil to adjust to the 
patterns considered correct for the protection of industrial or 
intellectual property. As was even reported, Kantor is tired of 
Brazilian explanations that the approval of the specific draft 
bill was in Congress' hands, which led U.S. officials to believe 
the Brazilian Government had no political will to change the 
country's previous stance regarding patents. Even at the worst 
moments, Brazilian diplomacy did not become discouraged and kept 
open the direct as well as the indirect communication channels 
with Washington through the Foreign Ministry and the embassy. 
Brazil's position was clearly stated: If, after almost seven 
years of the Uruguay Round of talks, guidelines regarding 
intellectual property were established and the government 
officially promised to sign them during the April meeting in 
Marrakesh, there should be no controversy with the United States 
on the subject. All that needs to be done is adopt the 
regulations negotiated at the international level, which is what 
Brazil intends to do. 
  Kantor's note significantly asserts that "Brazil has 
demonstrated its leadership role by promptly implementing 
Uruguay Round measures regarding intellectual property." This 
represents an undoubtable step forward because it clearly means 
that the United States accepts that international economic 
relations be established according to GATT regulations -- or 
those of the World Trade Organization (OMC) that will replace 
the GATT, without intending to impose its own regulations. 
Consequently, it is assumed that Washington will accept that 
international organization's ruling in case of controversies. 
  Those who eternally uphold conspiracy theories will say that 
the United States will reach "secret agreements" with Brazil. 
In addition to being offensive to our two democracies, the 
argument sounds ridiculous. Is a secret agreement necessary for 
sovereign countries to promise to abide by international 
regulations and procedures? 
  We must mention the contribution Kantor's decision has made 
to the success of the conference scheduled to be held in May in 
Washington where President Clinton will meet the democratically 
elected Latin American and Caribbean chiefs of state. Solving 
conflicts through negotiations is essential for the proposal of 
the economic integration of the continent's countries to make 
progress.

  [Text] Brasilia -- On 1 March the government issued 
Provisional Measure No. 438, establishing restrictions on 
foreign capital to be invested in stock exchanges. The new 
decree provides for the levying of the Financial Operations Tax 
(IOF) on exchange operations, which will have to pay as high as 
25 percent in IOF. A total of $12 billion were invested in the 
stock exchange last year. 
  Gustavo Franco, international area director at the Central 
Bank [BC], yesterday asserted, however, that the government will 
not restrict the entrance of foreign capital into the country. 
He explained that the government is not interested in imposing 
more restrictions on the inflow of foreign capital, at least 
until the new currency, the real, is instituted. 
  He stressed: It would be a contradiction to impose 
restrictions before the real becomes effective, as we are then 
going to need reserves. He also acknowledged that the 
unification of foreign exchange markets may be effected on the 
same day the real is instituted as the currency. 
  According to Franco, the provisional measure only seeks to 
consolidate the legislation on the IOF and to put an end to 
lawsuits as far as exchange operations are concerned. He 
nonetheless conceded that the financial market was in turmoil 
after the news of the provisional measure was learned. Franco 
said that yesterday the BC had been deluged with requests for 
authorization to issue bonds abroad. 
  He stated: People rushed to request authorizations so as to 
avoid paying the 25 percent tax. 
  Franco explained that the rate of 25 percent had been 
established since 1980, and that the implementation of the 3 and 
5 percent rates -- levied on incoming capital for fixed earnings 
operations and issuance of bonds abroad, which came into force 
last year -- gave rise to legal problems. He could not, 
however, explain the three-month delay in the filing of legal 
proceedings once the new rates were instituted in November 1993. 
  On 2 March the BC suspended the five-day deadline for the 
automatic approval of authorization requests in case it is 
unable to meet the said deadline during in the coming days. 
According to Franco, it will be impossible for the BC to 
analyze all the requests that were submitted yesterday to the BC 
within five days. 
  A source close to the BC guaranteed that the intention of 
the 
economic team is also to control the black market dollar, as it 
has now become the favorite target for irregular transactions 
because of its lagging behind the commercial rate -- or in other 
words, the black market dollar rate of exchange is lower than 
that of the commercial dollar. In order to check these 
irregular transactions, the BC determined on 2 March that all 
real cruzeiro remittances for the payment of debts abroad be 
made following the submission of the necessary documentation. 
  This CB measure will be instrumental in thwarting a 
transaction often made by importers, which consisted of paying 
for their imports in real cruzeiros, i.e., by just remitting 
money, which enabled them to keep the bill of lading for their 
imports. The transaction was thus cheaper. As Franco 
explained, the idea behind this was to get returns when the 
black market dollar exchange rate becomes once again higher than 
that of the commercial dollar. In that case, the importer would 
have resort to the bill of lading to bring dollars from abroad 
at the commercial rate of exchange, just to subsequently sell 
them on the black market. In a move that sought to push the 
black market dollar up, the BC also decided yesterday that any 
dollar amount exceeding the limit allowed for banks may be 
deposited at the BC. Banks are thus expected to be more willing 
to receive dollar notes.

<F P=106> [Article by Rossana Alves] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- During a breakfast with foreign 
correspondents, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso used 
the occasion to send a tough message to Congress: The 
government is not willing to negotiate the terms of the 
provisional measure creating the Real Value Unit (URV) with the 
legislative branch because the program must be fully maintained. 
According to the minister, if the legislative branch approves 
the measure, the possibility of running for president will be 
more remote. If the legislative branch rejects the measure, it 
would pave the way for his departure from the government and his 
involvement in the campaign. 
  Already anticipating that the PSDB [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party] would strongly press him to become the party's 
presidential candidate, Fernando Henrique noted: "If Congress 
says no to my proposals, it would be the best way of making me a 
candidate. If Congress says yes, it would bind me. By saying 
no, Congress would liberate me. If Congress makes a drastic 
decision against my proposals, it is not necessary for me to 
remain in the government." 
  The minister noted that it would not be viable to implement 
the new currency by 2 April when the deadline for the ministers 
who are also candidates to leave the government expires. 
Nevertheless, he cautioned that if prices run out of control, 
the government might advance the implementation of the new 
currency because the measure allows for the creation of the real 
at any time. 
<H5>  Rates </H5>
  The provisional measure restores to the finance minister the 
power to establish rate increases in electricity, fuels, 
telecommunications, and postal services, among other services. 
According to Fernando Henrique, the governors may not increase 
the energy rates, for example, without previous approval by the 
ministry. The previous rules will be maintained: Once or twice 
a month the rates will be adjusted using the average rates of 
the past four months. 
<H5>  Oligopolies </H5>
  The Finance Ministry has listed the prices for 470 products 
sold by oligopolies during the past three years. If there are 
any abusive increases, the minister noted, entrepreneurs will be 
summoned to give explanations. Fernando Henrique admitted that 
it will not be easy to negotiate with these sectors, which are 
responsible for 30 percent of the products included in the 
inflation rate. Nevertheless, he announced that the government 
might reduce import tariffs as a way of preventing excessive 
increases. The minister cautioned that it is not easy to 
negotiate with oligopolies "in Brazil or the United States." 
<H5>  Minimum Wages </H5>
  Despite the fact that the government has formed a commission 
to study a way of increasing the minimum wage's purchasing power 
by 50 percent by the end of year, Fernando Henrique described 
this possibility as not viable. In his opinion, the commission 
will study if minimum wages can be increased, guaranteeing 
economic stability. Fernando Henrique noted that the decree 
forming the commission "is a sign that the government is not 
satisfied with minimum wages, that they are low." He used the 
occasion to satirize the trade unions that announced strikes 
against the losses caused by the conversion to the URV system. 
<H5>  Public Deficit </H5>
  The minister guaranteed that the government managed to bring 
the public deficit to zero last year -- both the primary deficit 
(revenues less expenditures, not including interest) and the 
operational deficit (including expenditures and interest) -- at 
the expense of strongly curbing expenditures. He reported that 
the government now wants to guarantee a zero deficit without 
withholding the release of appropriations and without using the 
so-called inflationary tax that totaled about $12 billion last 
year. The minister hinted that the declining inflation rate 
will cause problems for state banks, which will have to 
introduce a strong adjustment to survive in a stabilized 
economy. He said: "There will be a shower of marches and 
protests by bank employees, especially Bank of Brazil employees, 
because the banks will have to streamline." 
<H5>  Foreign Exchange Rate </H5>
  Despite the substantial entry of dollars, which causes 
problems in the management of the quantity of real cruzeiros 
circulating in the economy, the minister ruled out the 
possibility of implementing measures to restrict the entry of 
foreign capital into Brazil. According to the minister, the 
government has not officially put our national currency at par 
with the dollar, like in Argentina, in order to allow more 
leeway in establishing the foreign exchange rate. The goal is 
to prevent an overvaluation of real cruzeiros against dollars, 
which would discourage exports. 
<H5>  Privatizations </H5>
  The minister announced that the government plans to sell its 
minority stock in public and private enterprises, including the 
National Iron and Steel Company, this week. Through 
privatizations, the government hopes to collect $900 million 
this year.

  [Text] Without any party leader to defend it, the 
government yesterday became the main target of attacks from 
lawmakers who took the floor at the Chamber of Deputies in 
Brasilia. PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and PT 
[Workers Party] lawmakers united to accuse Finance Minister 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso of harming workers through the 
conversion of salaries into the real value unit (URV). In Sao 
Paulo, Civilian Household Chief Henrique Hargreaves said that 
the government is willing to negotiate the economic plan in 
Congress, but with some restrictions. 
  "The plan may not be distorted," Hargreaves said. "If 
Congress cooperates with proposals to improve it, the government 
is willing to study them," he said, adding that "I am convinced, 
however, that the plan will be approved, because congressmen 
will not take the responsibility of rejecting it without 
proposing alternatives." 
  Hargreaves last night attended the ceremony introducing the 
new General Motors car, the Corsa, at the General Motors plant 
in San Jose dos Campos (Sao Paulo), where the majority of 
entrepreneurs praised the plan. He represented President Itamar 
Franco, who canceled his presence at the event at the last 
moment -- on Sunday evening -- following publication of the new 
price index. 
  Hargreaves declined to refer to technical details of the 
plan, on the grounds that it is not his area. He said he knows 
that the finance minister has admitted that some sectors will 
sustain salary losses, but he does not expect strikes, because 
workers will in the long term win. 
  "The only objective of the government and of President 
Itamar 
Franco is to find a solution for the country to improve," he 
said. "Congress is aware of the difficulties," he said. 
<H5>  Critical Topics </H5>
  In Congress, a large number of lawmakers expected 
modifications in the provisional measure that created the URV. 
Congressmen, who were dissatisfied, pointed at two critical 
topics in the government proposal: the salary deterioration and 
the lack of control over prices. 
  "It is a plan to be negotiated, and it is natural for it to 
undergo changes," said PMDB Deputy for Rio Grande do Sul Germano 
Rigotto, who is candidate for rapporteur of Provisional Measure 
No. 434 and for assuming the leading role in the negotiations. 
PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] Senator for Ceara Beni 
Veras, the finance minister's fellow party member, has said that 
"there is always room for negotiations." 
  PT members said they would propose changes in the 
provisional 
measure in order to convert salaries by the highest inflation 
rate. PT Deputy for Rio Grande do Sul Paulo Paim -- the chairman 
of the Labor Committee -- said that the Chamber has the 
obligation of preparing a conversion program to guarantee 
conversion by "at least the inflation rate, as is granted to 
workers by the current salary policy." He recalled that labor 
sectors with collective agreement renewal dates on 1 March will 
sustain a loss of 33 percent, according to the Interunion 
Department for Statistics and Socioeconomic Studies (DIEESE). 
  PMDB Deputy for Pernambuco Nilson Gibson, who referred to 
Cardoso as the "atheist minister," said that the salary loss is 
"the worst deterioration since the time of Minister Delfim 
Netto."

  [Text] Part of the Brazilian population woke up 28 February 
with more optimism. The rest began the day praying. In general, 
people are insecure and poorly informed. Even some politicians 
very close to the government have said they know very little 
about the new economic plan. URV [Real Value Unit] is an acronym 
that means hope for some people and loss and injustice for 
others. There are various reactions to this still unclear 
acronym. Some people vow to incorporate it into routine life 
swiftly and with confidence, while others threaten to fight it 
with a general strike. 
  There are many doubts about the plan. The salary 
deterioration issue is one of the first problems Brazilians 
would like to see clarified. Few people believe Finance Minister 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso's promise that workers will not be 
harmed. The directors of the main Brazilian industries -- even 
though willing to support the change -- are concerned about the 
government possibly increasing the ICMS [goods and services 
distribution tax] and the possibility of costs being pressured 
by suppliers and manpower. Minister Cardoso's leading role in 
the plan's implementation, at the time of presidential 
elections, is another source of doubts. 
  Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes: "I listened 
carefully to everything. The minister talked a lot but I could 
not understand anything. I am in the same situation as 150 
million Brazilians who do not know anything. I am a good 
Brazilian and I want it to succeed. I will pray and ask God for 
the plan's success. Since I am close to the Lord of Bonfim, I 
will pray to him." 
  Brazilian Federation of Banks (Febraban) President Alcides 
Tapias: "The financial sector will gradually adapt itself to 
the plan. Society needs to understand the URV, and the 
government has to control spending. The plan depends on 
credibility. It would be ideal to delay implementation of the 
new currency so society can see the government's transparent 
behavior. I am not concerned about strikes because the 
conversion of salaries is fair." 
  General Workers Confederation [CGT] President Francisco 
Caninde Pegado: "The CGT has total distrust in the new 
government economic plan's measures. The proposal to convert 
salaries by an average value, disregarding February's inflation 
rate, leads to the conclusion that we will have major salary 
losses. There is no magic in this. Workers have not received an 
answer yet on the possible inflation rate in URV's. We cannot 
support a plan like that." 
  Sole Workers Center (CUT) President Jair Meneguelli: "The 
plan does not have anything that can improve the economy or 
reduce inflation. It will produce salary deterioration, and its 
only merit is that it will institute a salary policy with daily 
adjustments. But what will happen if the inflation rate affects 
the URV? We will have no salary policy at all, and this could be 
chaos." 
  Workers Party (PT) President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva: 
"Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic plan follows the 
IMF's guidance for stabilizing the currency and resolving the 
problems of Brazilian creditors. Even if conditions at this time 
are not ripe, the atmosphere for a general strike will surely 
develop, depending on the size of the loss that workers will 
suffer." 
  Former Central Bank President Ibrahim Eris: "It is a plan 
that calls for moderate sacrifice from society, nothing 
dramatic. With the URV's adoption, difficulties will tend to 
disappear. Brazil's indexation is so sophisticated that only 
those without access to the financial sector will suffer 
inflation losses. That is why those people will be the main 
beneficiaries of the plan, of the economy's stabilization. 
Society will become accustomed to the new index in 60 days." 
  Ricardo Yazbek, president of the Association of Sao Paulo 
Real Estate Enterprises (Secovi): "It is a plan without magic 
and with the conditions essential for success: The deficit was 
eliminated, there is a high level of reserves, and the minister 
has credibility." 
  Ruy Altenfelder, director-treasurer of FIESP [Sao Paulo 
State 
Federation of Industries]: "There is a consensus among 
entrepreneurs that the working class should not suffer salary 
deterioration. Anything in this regard will be negotiated." 
  FIESP Department of Economy Director Mario Bernardini: 
"Everything leads to the conclusion that there will be 
inflationary pressure and if appropriate measures are not 
implemented, the inflation rate's drop will be temporary." 
  Carlos Eduardo Uchoa Fagundes, president of the Brazilian 
Association of Lighting Equipment Manufacturers (Abilux): "We 
should not forget that it is a temporary plan. Only structural 
reforms, especially tax reform, can turn it into something 
stable." 
  Jose Joao Locoselli, president of the Brazilian Association 
of Cleaning Product Manufacturers (Abipla): "If the public 
deficit does not disappear, we will be simply changing our 
currency and nothing else. An artificial plan will not resolve 
anything." 
  Eduardo Capobianco, president of the Civil Construction 
Industry Association (Sinduscon): "Our contracts were frozen 
for one year because over this period the sector's index that 
reflects our cost variation will not be used. This can produce 
turbulence." 
  Siemens President Herman Wever: "Conflicts in negotiations 
between enterprises will increase. But this is healthy. I have 
not yet reported the plan's details to our headquarters because 
I believe they will not understand anything." 
  Olivetti President Enrico Misasi: "The government will 
have to make a great effort to implement the fiscal adjustment 
before replacing the real cruzeiro with another currency. 
Without this, I see no possibilities for controlling inflation." 
  Ivan Botelho of the Cataguazes-Leopoldina enterprise: "The 
plan did not change anything and, summarizing, it is only a 
salary plan and a plan for controlling new contracts. There are 
no major changes for the population." 
  Eduardo Eugenio Gouveia Vieira, director of the Federation 
of 
Rio de Janeiro Industries: "Article 34 of the provisional 
measure provides for some price control, and even seems to be a 
disguised freeze." 
  Bradesco [Brazilian Discount Bank] President Lazaro de Mello 
Brandao: "The plan's good point is its strong budget balance. 
The salary policy already has been approved and the URV is being 
properly assimilated." 
  Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company] President Osires 
Silva: "I am optimistic. I believe it will work better than 
Argentina's Cavallo plan because in that country the measures 
were strongly orthodox. I believe the plan will benefit both 
enterprises and workers." 
  Alvaro Augusto Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo Stock 
Exchange (Bovespa) and the Paulista Bank: "The URV is simply a 
salary and contract index. Inflationary expectations -- which 
will continue -- will be embedded in the price of products." 
  Edward Amadeo, Rio de Janeiro Catholic University economics 
professor: "The inflationary trend in real cruzeiros could 
speed up because prices are uncontrolled and some enterprises 
already have said they will not set prices in URV's. This would 
make any increase very obvious." 
  Lawyer Ary Oswaldo Mattos Filho: "The plan has been 
gradually discussed; it has been implemented without shocks and 
respecting all contracts. One of its major merits is that it is 
the plan that is causing the fewest number of jolts, especially 
in the transition period between enforcement of the URV and 
creation of the real." 
  Reynaldo Goncalves, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro 
(UFRJ) professor: "The government feels comfortable with its 
$33 billion reserve that supports the plan, but it is actually 
sitting on a powder keg." 
  Celso Bastos, Sao Paulo Catholic University constitutional 
law professor: "In general terms, the plan is positive and more 
legal than all the others because it does not include conversion 
tables and confiscations, which were negative measures because 
of the distortions they caused. This plan does not imply great 
violence." 
  Lawyer and taxation specialist Ives Gandra: "The bonus that 
the government has granted to state-run enterprises has once 
again created first- and second-class Brazilians. It is 
unethical and unjustified because the government preaches 
austerity." 
  Guilherme Afif Domingos, president of the Brazilian 
Confederation of Commercial Associations: "The plan's success 
depends on the presence of Fernando Henrique Cardoso. 
Oligopolies can manage to impose prices, but the others cannot. 
If businesses adjust prices by the highest rate, they will have 
to reduce prices in URV's after a drop in sales. My doubts refer 
to the plan's management because we are in a time of a 
presidential succession." 
  General Motors do Brasil Vice President Andre Beer: "The 
plan was intelligently managed, without pressure or a freeze. 
There is an atmosphere of tranquillity and optimism. But we will 
have to see what happens with our suppliers and labor, and 
whether they will pressure costs. The point we feel most 
concerned about is the threat of the states, through the 
National Fiscal Policy Council (Confaz), increasing the ICMS." 
  Sergio Reze, president of the National Federation of Vehicle 
Dealers (Fenabrave): "We suggested dollarization of car prices 
in January 1993 and we were criticized, even by the government. 
The URV is important because it will give consumers a reference 
for evaluating the real cost of products. Most car manufacturers 
are already adjusting prices on a daily basis, and the trend is 
to immediately adopt the URV." 
  Luiz Adelar Scheuer, president of the National Association 
of 
Automotive Vehicle Manufacturers (Anfavea): "Everybody tends to 
adopt the URV. What we should now is see the behavior of taxes, 
raw material prices, and salaries. If they are increased, this 
will be passed on in final prices. But I do not think there will 
be cost increases."

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of </F>
the Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries and Sao Paulo State 
Industries Center, FIESP-CIESP] 
  [Text] The FHC [Fernando Henrique Cardoso] economic plan, 
the main item of which is the implementation of the Real Value 
Unit [URV], constitutes an organized government effort to subdue 
the inflationary process, but it will not be successful in the 
medium or long term unless it is supplemented by structural 
reforms allowing the mounting of an effective fight against 
inflation's roots and causes. When the URV is transformed into 
the real, the economic program will be able to reduce the 
present inflation rate to around zero. But this achievement will 
be in vain unless the country can implement a state and tax 
reform program, introduce changes into the social security and 
political systems, and make other adjustments that are essential 
for balancing the economic system. 
  We are afraid the FHC plan's effects will not last long 
because we do not know if the economic stabilization strategy 
based on the real will be maintained for long. We know the 
structural problems were not removed. The fiscal adjustment 
implemented so far has great deficiencies and loopholes. If we 
are not capable of formulating more permanent answers to unravel 
the crisis, we will surely fall down the same hill that 
destroyed the Cruzado Plan, which had a big impact but a short 
life. The simple change in currency will not take us anywhere. 
  In this context, we are greatly concerned by the cost to be 
paid by industry and employees. We know that by indexing the 
foreign exchange to the value of the real, eventual residual 
inflations in the real will mean a loss of Brazilian 
competitiveness in the internal and external markets. That 
situation would disorganize the market, creating instability and 
great expectations in the productive sector. This is precisely 
why we hope the plan will be successful and sustained in an 
orderly fashion, the constitutional revision process will end in 
good form, meaningful changes will be promoted in the field of 
monopolies, the privatization process will be speeded up, and 
changes will be introduced in the field of social security, 
among other items. 
  On the other hand, our industries vigorously defend the 
maintenance of the purchasing power of workers' salaries. We 
oppose any attempt at reducing salaries because we understand 
consumers' purchasing power is an instrument that consolidates 
markets. We also support the idea of maintaining salaries at 
realistic levels. All salary losses must be negotiated before 
the plan's second phase takes effect. 
  We also believe that the sooner the market converts to the 
URV the sooner and more successful the plan's next stage, which 
includes the creation of the new currency. Then we will be able 
to rid ourselves of high inflation rates. We will closely follow 
the next steps, knowing that the obstacles that still must be 
overcome must be resolved through negotiations on all fronts. 
That aspect might contain the secret of the plan's success. We 
believe the country is already mature enough to discuss, at all 
social and institutional levels, its priority programs and its 
preferred path to definitively defeat this climate of crisis. 
  Industries expect politicians to be sympathetic to the 
expressions of support and hopes of all social groups, and will 
see in the FHC plan not an instrument to gain political mileage 
but a program of substantial economic changes. This is why the 
plan's success will depend on our legislators' spirit of public 
service. Without structural reforms capable of supplementing the 
FHC plan's weaknesses, we will again risk making the same old 
mistake, the outcome of which we all know is not at all pleasant.

  [Text] Brasilia -- As of today, the Central Bank will 
monitor dollar quotes in order to set the Real Value Unit (URV) 
close to the dollar value. Gustavo Franco, director of the 
Central Bank Foreign Department, said on 28 February that the 
URV will be the Central Bank's dollar sale indicator. "If the 
dollar reaches a specific value, which will be the URV, the 
Central Bank will begin selling dollars," he explained. That 
will be the basis of the exchange policy, which will keep the 
dollar and the URV at the same value, preventing shifts between 
both currencies. 
  Economic team members believe the level of Brazilian cash 
reserves (immediately available) -- of $33 billion -- permits 
implementation of the exchange policy. 
  Economic Policy Secretary Winston Fritsch said on 28 
February 
that "with such a reserve level, I do not think anyone should 
challenge the Central Bank." In practice, the exchange level 
will be coupled with the URV. "The exchange rate will follow the 
URV," Finance Ministry Executive Secretary Clovis Carvalho has 
said. 
  Central Bank President Pedro Malan denied that the dollar 
has 
been adjusted below inflation for the last five months. "This 
has not happened with the IPC [consumer price index], the IGPM 
[average general price index], and the IPCA [expanded consumer 
price index], which are used for calculation of the URV," he 
said. Malan blamed such reports on exporters.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Casado and Marta Salomon] </F>
  [Text] One problem that President Itamar Franco and Finance 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso still are unable to solve is 
who will carry on with the plan to stabilize the economy after 2 
April, the deadline for candidates to resign from their 
executive branch positions. 
  Finance Minister Cardoso has not been able to give an 
objective answer to questions about his future -- as a minister 
or a candidate -- since the rules to control inflation were 
released 48 hours ago. 
  He chose to remain ambiguous. "You are talking as if I were 
irreplaceable," Cardoso said ironically early yesterday morning. 
Then he rambled: "If I wanted to run I would have done what was 
easiest: freeze prices, increase salaries..." 
  Pressure on the minister from inside and outside the 
government to run is growing. The pressure is directly 
proportional to the belief that, with the plan, the election 
will coincide with a process of a substantial drop in the 
inflation rate. 
  In the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] -- the 
minister's party and the government's main supporter in Congress 
-- the consensus is that there are no alternatives to Cardoso's 
candidacy and that right now, when the plan has just been 
released, is the right time to begin organizing the campaign in 
the streets. 
  The beginning of a movement within the party to put Tasso 
Jereissati -- PSDB president, former Ceara governor, and one of 
Cardoso's strongest allies -- at the head of the Finance 
Ministry is already noticeable. 
  Jereissati is a former almost-minister. He was announced as 
the finance minister during the Jose Sarney administration, 
replacing Dilson Funaro, who had resigned. Funaro was the 
creator of the Cruzado Plan and is a participant in the current 
plan's genesis. His nomination, however, was vetoed by the most 
important PMDB leader of the time, the late Ulysses Guimaraes. 
  Cardoso has a seductive scenario in front of him. The 
ingredients are the real prospect of an improvement of his 
public image in conjunction with an anticipated drop in the 
inflation rate. He has also been receiving signs of a genuine 
possibility of mounting a broad multiparty alliance to support 
his candidacy. 
  It would be a renovated version of the extinct Democratic 
Alliance. In it, the minister-candidate's PSDB would join forces 
with the PFL [Liberal Front Party] of Bahia Governor Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes [ACM], the anti-[Orestes] Quercia PMDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] faction, important 
factions of the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] of Paulo Maluf, 
the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], and the PP [Popular Party]. 
  The main target would be candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva 
of the PT [Workers Party], who has been the favorite in all 
surveys on presidential succession for more than a year. 
  The Bahia governor -- the main PFL leader -- has been 
talking 
about the issue with influential PSDB leaders such as Ceara 
Governor Ciro Gomez. 
  On 1 March in Congress, ACM allies tried to include on 
today's voting agenda a constitutional amendment that not only 
would have extended the deadline for the incompatibility of 
governors and mayors, but also would have included ministers. 
  Lula's PT already has perceived such behind-the-scenes 
maneuvers and started discussing how to prevent the economic 
plan from becoming an electoral jumping board for Cardoso by 
facilitating an alliance of the PSDB with center-right factions. 
The alliance Lula wants and needs most is precisely one 
including the minister's party. 
  The finance minister, in turn, decided to make time (days). 
He needs another Cardoso at the Finance Ministry and also a 
minimum period to make sure that the URV and the real will leave 
the drafting board the way it was planned.

<F P=106> [By Luiz Carlos Azedo] </F>
  [Text] Sao Paulo -- Talks are under way between the leaders 
of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party [PSDB] and the Liberal 
Front Party [PFL] to set up a broad alliance to launch the 
candidacy of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso for 
president of the Republic and of Deputy Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes, 
leader of the PFL-PTB [Brazilian Labor Party]-PSC [Social 
Christian Party] bloc in the Chamber of Deputies, for vice 
president. Yesterday in Sao Paulo, PSDB bloc leader Deputy Jose 
Sierra spent the morning trying to persuade Senator Mario Covas, 
leader of the PSDB bloc in the Senate and candidate for governor 
of Sao Paulo State, that the alliance is possible and essential 
for the country. Covas opposes the alliance because he feels 
that the PSDB and the PFL are ideologically incompatible. 
  Covas' major point of concern is the situation in Bahia 
State, where the PSDB members are diehard opponents of Governor 
Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, the father of Deputy Luiz Eduardo and 
sponsor of the Cardoso-Magalhes slate. Ranking PSDB members in 
Bahia such as Waldir Pires, Jutahy Junior, and Salvador Mayor 
Lidice da Mata -- who are in favor of setting up an anti-Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes front -- are against the proposed PSDB-PFL 
alliance. Senator Jutahy Magalhaes has warned Covas that such 
an alliance would cause the PSDB in Bahia to implode. 
  The economic team would be delighted with a PSDB-PFL 
alliance, on which some PSDB sectors have been working from the 
outset of negotiations over the stabilization plan. The chances 
for this alliance to materialize have improved following the 
outcome of the latest PFL meeting last week when Governor 
Antonio Carlos Magalhaes described as hasty the launching of his 
candidacy and endorsed the idea of an alliance with the PSDB. 
  Deputy Jose Anibal (PSDB-Sao Paulo) said: The PFL has worked 
with the PSDB and has contributed far more closely to making 
Finance Minister Cardoso's economic policy a success than the 
PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and the PT [Workers 
Party]. Aware of this situation, Governor Magalhaes made his 
move. 
  Encouraged by the positive reaction to the proposal, PFL 
President Jorge Bornhausen yesterday met with Deputy Luiz 
Eduardo Magalhaes and with Senator Marco Maciel to discuss the 
issue and the position the PFL should adopt from now on. Yet, 
he is elusive about all this. 
  Bornhausen said: The three of us always work together. 
Based on a decision made at the PFL meeting in Recife, we are 
going to tour the country until 25 March to sound out the 
feelings of leading PFL members. We have contacted the PSDB and 
Minister Cardoso and the possibility of a PSDB-PFL alliance has 
always been considered but never pursued. Thus far we have not 
received any formal proposal from the PSDB to this effect.

the PFL's [Liberal Front Party] obvious presidential candidate. 
He made it clear, however, that his candidacy is negotiable and 
may be exchanged for an alliance. He said: "Each party cannot 
have its own candidate, and people should not consider 
themselves invincible just because they may have respectable 
aspirations. Right now the nation comes first." 
  This was the tone of Magalhaes' speech at the opening of the 
1994 Bahia State Legislative Assembly sessions. On 1 March, the 
governor stayed in touch with Brasilia throughout the day. He 
believes the fate of the constitutional amendment, which could 
change the requirement for people in executive positions like 
his to resign from them in order to run for president, will be 
decided in the next 48 hours. 
  The governor said he is not working to push the amendment 
through and that all parties will be free to vote as they 
please. Magalhaes recalled, however, that the Constitution had 
reduced the terms of office for governors who took over on 15 
March 1991. He explained: "The proper thing to do would be to 
restore the lost portion, and one way of doing this would be by 
approving the amendment that will extend the deadline by which 
presidential hopefuls must resign from their executive 
positions. It also would be nice if reelections were possible 
because if that were to happen Brazil would witness something 
unprecedented in Bahia State: the lack of candidates willing to 
compete with me for the governorship."

<F P=106> [From the "Estadao Column" by Cristiana Lobo] </F>
  [Text] A recent poll shows a substantial growth in [Finance 
Minister] Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy for the 
presidential race: He moved from 6 percent, a level at which he 
remained stable for some months, to 12 percent of the electoral 
preference, climbing to third place in this race. 
  PT [Workers Party] candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva still 
is the favorite, even though he lost 3 percentage points: He 
fell from 30 to 27 percent of the votes. PPR [Progressive 
Renewal Party candidate] Paulo Maluf remains in second place 
with 17 percent of the electoral preference. 
  After this poll, the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] 
will press Fernando Henrique Cardoso even more to leave his post 
by the end of the month in order to run for Itamar Franco's job. 
Meanwhile, the PSDB says the decision remains with the minister 
himself. 
  Senator Mario Covas said: "Fernando will entirely let events 
take their course. He is a man with public spirit. Thus, he 
will decide if he stays or leaves. He is not a vulgar 
opportunist." 
  President Itamar Franco's advisers already are acquainted 
with the poll. During the past few days, Franco has discussed 
this issue with politicians and has begun to consider a 
replacement. The PSDB is very interested in this issue because 
the economic program's success depends on Cardoso's management.

months, estimates that the irregular payment of pensions in Rio 
de Janeiro caused other $1.5 billion loss. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE 
SAO PAULO in Portuguese 28 Feb 94) 
  Mines and Energy Minister Israel Vargas announced on 2 March 
that the Brazilian Petroleum Corporation, Petrobras, has 
discovered four new oil fields that will increase the country's

  [Text] Tania Maria Cordeiro, a Brazilian citizen, was 
notified this morning of her release from prison, after having 
been held in custody for nearly a year. 
  Soon after 1000 local time [1600 GMT], Cordeiro was taken 
from Rengua Penitentiary to Rancagua Courthouse, where she was 
officially notified of the Supreme Court ruling granting her 
release. 
  Cordeiro was arrested by Investigative Police personnel in 
March on charges of participating in the holdup of a telephone 
company at Graneros together with two other persons. 
  During an exclusive interview with the "24 Hours" news 
program, Cordeiro reiterated that she had been tortured and 
raped at the First Investigative Police Precinct. Judge 
Alejandro Solis was appointed to investigate her case. The 
result of the investigation conducted by Judge Solis proved that 
there was no concrete evidence to support Cordeiro's charges 
against the Investigative Police. Despite this, eight policemen 
have been indicted for arbitrary detention, psychological 
harassment, and counterfeiting documents.

Department, southeast of Lima, today. The measure, published in 
the official newspaper EL PERUANO, stated certain constitutional 
guarantees will be suspended and that the Armed Forces will be 
in charge of internal order. The decree stemmed from the need 
to facilitate antiterrorist operations in that department.

  [Text] Mr. Kim Pyong-sik has been in Lima since 20 
February. He is visiting from the DPRK. Mr. Kim Pyong-sik 
introduced himself as the chairman of the North Korean Social 
Democratic Party's Central Committee, although this party in 
reality depends on the communist Korean Workers' Party 
supporting Kim Il-song's dictatorship. In fact, the strange 
visitor has also been one of the DPRK vice presidents since his 
election to this post on 11 December 1993. 
  During his visit to Lima, Kim Pyong-sik, who arrived with a 
four-man entourage, met various personalities. His mission in 
Lima is not exactly known, but it has been leaked that he would 
afterwards tour Latin America, visiting Ecuador, Uruguay, and 
eventually Paraguay and Venezuela.

  [Text] Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani, who was 
decorated by Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro, said the 
Central American countries are more united now than ever in the 
search for consolidated peace in the region. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] Nicaraguan President Violeta 
Chamorro, presidents of the state branches, deputies, 
magistrates, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, ambassadors and 
heads of diplomatic missions accredited in Nicaragua, cabinet 
members, members of Nicaraguan private enterprise, special 
guests, dear friends: I am very pleased to be here in Nicaragua 
honoring my dear friend President Chamorro's cordial invitation. 
I have been even more honored tonight because I was awarded the 
General Jose Dolores Estrada San Jacinto Battle Order. I 
receive this decoration in the name of the Salvadoran people, 
the true forgers of peace and democracy in our country. If I am 
to be given credit for something, it is to have interpreted the 
Salvadoran people's vehement desire to live in peace and freedom. 
  During recent years, when I shared with Dona Violeta -- 
beyond protocol, I dare call her by that name out of affection 
-- so many Central American experiences, we have observed the 
close relationship between our peoples and their problems and 
solutions. History has provided deep common roots for the two 
peoples. It is from the tree of the present, so to speak, that 
we must pick the fruit of common destiny. El Salvador and 
Nicaragua are friendly countries for various reasons. 
Historical misfortunes have sometimes befallen us. The 
traditional lack of deeply rooted freedom has made us suffer 
untold trials and tribulations. From a certain date, what 
brings us closer together is the common effort to nurture 
democratic institutions on the arid land where authoritarianism 
and arbitrariness once throve. Our peoples are still suffering 
the consequences of many past mistakes, but in our respective 
peculiarities and difficulties, each of the two peoples agree on 
raising the banner of democracy. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Alfonso Malespin] </F>
  [Text] Before leaving Nicaragua yesterday, Salvadoran 
President Alfredo Cristiani said that his government will not 
meet the opposition FMLN's [Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front] demands for troops to be confined to their barracks one 
day prior to and one day following the 20 March elections and 
that troops not participate in transporting the ballot boxes. 
  The Salvadoran president met with COSEP [Higher Council of 
Private Enterprise] members in the morning and urged them to 
take a more active role in their country's political life. He 
also met with the Supreme Court justices, who requested that 
Cristiani support the proposed Central American Court of Justice. 
  The FMLN has said that the active participation of troops 
poses a danger of "technical electoral fraud" because they are 
still feared by many Salvadorans. 
  Cristiani, who received the Jose Dolores Estrada Order from 
President Violeta de Chamorro despite objections by the 
Nicaraguan Jesuit community, said that if he accepted such a 
demand to confine the troops to the barracks, he would be 
"acting against the Constitution because it would suppress a 
right guaranteed to citizens regardless of their profession." 
<H5>  Intimidating </H5>
  "The extent of the Armed Forces' participation has not gone 
beyond that requested by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE]. 
In addition, the Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] 
electoral commission has overseen their participation. 
  Cristiani's party, Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance], 
is favored to win the elections in a second round, although 
abstention is expected to exceed 40 percent. "There is no doubt 
that Arena will win," the Salvadoran president said in Managua. 
  The FMLN has accused soldiers of intimidating voters and has 
said that at least 500,000 voters will be unable to vote due to 
unresolved problems at the TSE. 
  At the end of Cristiani's last official visit to Managua, 
which was tinged by a violent clash between the National Police 
and former Government Ministry soldiers, he said Nicaragua will 
achieve political and economic development when "a climate of 
security" prevails in the country.

  [Text] Managua, 4 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- The Governments of 
Managua and El Salvador today signed a joint statement to 
stimulate economic integration and alleviate poverty in the 
area. Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani and Nicaraguan 
President Violeta Chamorro signed the joint statement this 
afternoon at the end of Cristiani's official visit to Nicaragua, 
which started on Thursday. 
  Chamorro and Cristiani reaffirmed their support for a 
proposal to create the Central American Social Investment Fund 
Against Poverty. It was agreed to create this fund in the 
Central American Bank for Economic Integration to alleviate 
poverty. In addition, Chamorro and Cristiani encouraged the 
international community to support this proposal both 
technically and financially to carry out programs and projects 
aimed at stimulating human development. 
  The presidents agreed that perfecting the integration 
process 
requires joining forces with the social and human development 
aspects to overcome poverty. 
  The two presidents expressed satisfaction over the recent 
signing of an agreement creating a Permanent Central American 
Commission for the Eradication of Production, Trafficking, 
Consumption, and Illegal Use of Narcotics and Psycotropic 
Substances, and Related Crimes. They agreed to create bilateral 
cooperation mechanisms for the "timely" treatment of matters 
that, because of their importance, deserve the area governments' 
joint attention. 
  They also expressed interest in developing a means of 
communication that can improve relations between the two 
countries. In this regard, they agreed to update a study to 
eventually resume the ferry service between El Salvador and 
Nicaragua on the Gulf of Fonseca. They also agreed to keep 
conducting studies to modernize the ports of Potosi in Nicaragua 
and La Union in El Salvador on this same gulf. 
  The presidents also admitted the need to keep in force the 
strategies and policies adopted within the framework of the 
International Association of Coffee-Producing Countries and the 
International Coffee Withholding Plan, strategies and policies 
which make it possible to get a realistic price of coffee. 
  Chamorro and Cristiani, upon considering the effects of 
NAFTA, reaffirmed their desire to temporarily receive benefits 
similar to those in the agreement until Central America 
definitively joins this instrument.

[Miskito, Sumu, and Rama Indians, and Creole groups 
organization] leader and Rio Cocoa candidate for the Liberal 
Constitutionalist Party, reacted with surprise to the proposal. 
  According to the document, the objectivies of the FSLN 
proposal are "to secure respect for the people's vote through 
proportional participation of each [political] force in the 
regional government." It also aims to politically stabilize the 
region by reducing signs of violence, threats, and terrorism. 
  The North Atlantic Sandinist leaders propose that the 
minimum 
bases for this government of unity be: security for all 
residents, labor stability, proportional distribution of 
positions on the Regional Council's board of directors, and a 
consensus on the election of the governor. Also, to guarantee 
the operation of municipal offices and the establishment of 
mechanisms to reach "a joint definition on government action 
with the participation of religious authorities and political 
forces that do not obtain seats on the Regional Council." 
  As a means of furthering the implementation of their 
proposal, the North Atlantic Sandinists suggest a meeting with 
the regional authorities of the parties that won seats on the 
Regional Council to discuss their proposal and the creation of a 
government transition commission.

Twenty-one Norwegian technicians are working in various regions 
of the country. Milviana Jerez has filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Jerez] Tom Tyrihjell, resident 
representative of the Norwegian Development Authority and Sergio 
Mario Blandon, acting foreign cooperation minister, signed the 
five-year agreement. The average cost for each technician who 
will provide technical assistance is $80,000. 
  [Tyrihjell, in progress] ...that is very important, because 
it represents a relationship more than technical cooperation. 
It is a relationship at the human level by Norwegian 
technicians who want to aid a developing country and return to 
their country with new experience. 
  [Jerez] The Norwegian technicians are lending their 
technical 
assistance in the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Rio San Juan Regions. 
  [Blandon, in progress] ...is really praiseworthy, because 
while we have difficult campaigns that hinder the cooperation 
process in Nicaragua, we are receiving encouragement from 
countries, such as yours, that are willing to help this country.

  [Text] Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo and Economy 
Minister Pablo Pereira revealed yesterday that the Public 
Investments Program, which the government considers "the other 
pillar" of its Economic Reactivation Plan, could collapse if the 
agreement with the IMF is not signed as soon as possible. 
  Lacayo also announced the beginning of a "diplomatic 
offensive" whereby economic cabinet ministers will travel to the 
United States and Europe to "lobby several people who are 
politically willing" to help us sign the agreement with the IMF. 
  "We want to sign it because we know that the flow of money 
for the agricultural cycle and the public investment programs 
depends on that agreement. However, the IMF has been very 
strict and unrelenting with us," the government official stated. 
  The ministers of the presidency, economy, construction, and 
FISE [Emergency Fund For Social Investments] appeared before the 
Nicaraguan Construction Chamber to present the Public 
Investments Program for 1994. They said 75 percent of the 
program depends on the signing of the agreement with the IMF. 
  The Public Investments Program allocates 1.476 billion 
cordobas for 133 projects. A total of 74 percent of the 
projects worth 1.087 billion cordobas are dependent upon foreign 
financing and are subject to the signing of the ESAF [Enhanced 
Structural Adjustment Facility]. 
  The agreement with the IMF is considered to be a sort of 
"audit" by the international financial organizations to allow 
the flow of at least $266 million to Nicaragua under the World 
Bank's so-called "Economic Recovery Credit II." 
  According to the government's estimates, the funds assigned 
to the Public Investments Program will prompt the construction 
industry to grow 25 percent -- in addition to its ripple effect 
on the economy -- and generate 40,000 permanent jobs in 1994. 
  Approximately 56 percent of the program or 825 million 
cordobas would be allocated for the reactivation and 
modernization of the country's economic infrastructure; 26 
percent or 338 million for the rehabilitation of basic social 
services; 19 percent or 282 million for the export support 
infrastructure; and 2 percent to strengthen the central 
government's administration. 
<H5>  Ministers to Apply Pressure </H5>
  As part of the "diplomatic offensive" mentioned by Lacayo, 
Foreign Cooperation Minister Erwin Kruger traveled to Paris and 
London this Wednesday to meet with influential world banking 
leaders. 
  Finance Minister Emilio Pereira, Foreign Minister Ernesto 
Leal, and Central Bank President Jose Evenor Taboada left for 
New York and Washington yesterday, where they expect to meet 
with IMF President Michel Camdessus. 
  "Our main argument is that Nicaragua should have a special 
status. We have found in most countries a willingness to favor 
us. However, we will not see the same attitude among 
international organizations because they have their standards 
and deal with economic problems by dissociating themselves from 
social or political problems," Lacayo said yesterday. 
  He added that the government will attempt to make these 
organizations see that it is not only a matter of correcting the 
economy but of ensuring peace and the democratic system. 
  "We hope we can enter the final stretch of the signing of 
the 
agreements with this diplomatic offensive," he observed.

<F P=106> [Report by Roberto Larios] </F>
  [Excerpt] Finance Minister Emilio Pereira admitted before 
the National Assembly's Economic Commission yesterday the 
government is planning to dismiss at least 15,000 workers during 
the next three years as a result of implementation of the 
so-called Labor Mobility Program [Programa de Movilidad Laboral]. 
  Virtually harassed by the commission deputies who asked him 
to explain the details of the program, Pereira conceded the 
government expects at least 5,000 workers will join the program 
per year. He added $89 million in foreign financing is being 
sought in 1994 to carry out the program. 
  Pereira kept contradicting himself when he answered 
deputies' 
questions. For example, he denied the Mifin [Finance Ministry] 
is pressuring ministries to reduce their budget when only a few 
days ago Education Minister Humberto Belli told the commission 
he was told at Mifin: "Either reduce your budget, or we will 
reduce it for you." He was told he had to reduce his budget by 
13 million cordobas. 
  Sandinist Deputy William Ramirez has described the 
minister's 
appearance as "disastrous." Pereira was accompanied by his 
deputy ministers, Mirna Somarriba and Rene Vallecillo. There 
was a moment when Ramirez complained to the officials, asking 
them why they had given the information little by little. 
  The officials had to face pressure from the deputies for 
more 
than four hours. They were demanding, among other things, a 
list of government offices that will be mainly affected by the 
Labor Mobility Program and the reduction of 140 million cordobas 
in public spending, measures demanded by international financial 
organizations. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brazilian President Itamar Franco and Venezuelan 
President Rafael Caldera agreed, during a meeting held at La 
Guzmania presidential residence, to increase bilateral 
cooperation and fully use consultation and political dialogue 
mechanisms. 
  The two presidents decided to create a high-level binational 
commission that will be chaired by their foreign ministers and 
comprised of the ministers in charge of bilateral cooperation 
issues. The presidents also agreed to hold the second meeting 
of the Venezuela-Brazil political consultation mechanism in our 
country. Furthermore, they issued instructions to authorities 
in the foreign trade sector to assess and step up the 
negotiations to reach an economic complementation agreement 
within the ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] 
framework. 
  Even though no agreements were signed in the meeting, it 
helped establish the groundwork for common projects in different 
sectors. In the highway sector they agreed to finish highway 
BR-174 and to broaden a land transportation agreement. In the 
electric sector they reached an agreement for the purchase of 
Venezuelan energy. In the hydrographic sector the topic was 
navigability between the Orinoco and Amazon Rivers. In the 
mining sector they will work jointly to protect Indians at the 
border area. In the ecology sector the issue was ecological 
tourism in a joint action to recover areas degraded by illegal 
miners. In the steel works sector the SIDOR [Orinoco Iron and 
Steel Works] furnaces will manufacture iron and manganese alloys. 
  Later, during a news conference, the Brazilian president 
said 
his government is carefully analyzing border problems with our 
country, adding that neither Venezuela nor Brazil should neglect 
looking into these issues because they might cause an atmosphere 
of uncertainty in the relations between the two nations. 
Moreover, President Rafael Caldera said that following the 
talks with his counterpart he is fully convinced the current 
Brazilian Government is clearly inclined to adopt the necessary 
measures to prevent illegal mining on Venezuelan territory. 
  [Begin recording] [Franco, in Portuguese] It is clear that 
the border problem between Brazil and Venezuela will be 
carefully analyzed. We have a very extensive border with 
Venezuela, a border that was abandoned by our peoples. Now with 
the presence of President Rafael Caldera and with the presence 
of the Brazilian Government, we will be able to study and 
carefully analyze those aspects which today cause problems in 
our relations. 
  [Caldera] I am fully convinced that the current Brazilian 
Government is clearly inclined to adopt all the measures 
possible to prevent the garimpeiros' [Brazilian gold seekers] 
illegal mining activities in Venezuela -- both by watching the 
border and by adopting precautionary measures in the State of 
Roraima and other border states where they may have their 
operations centers and by enforcing legal measures through 
Brazilian courts against those who have perpetrated illegal 
actions in this area. [end recording] 
  Referring to the first meeting held between the heads of 
state of Venezuela and Brazil, Gilberto [as heard] Poletto, 
minister of state and president of the Foreign Trade Institute, 
and Andres Velasquez, governor of Bolivar State, agreed that new 
roads have been opened to strengthen bilateral relations. 
  [Begin recording] [Poletto] There was talk about stepping up 
the negotiations to sign an economic cooperation agreement 
between Venezuela and Brazil because this had been discussed a 
couple of years ago. This will bolster the partial agreement we 
currently have, perhaps by adding more products and including 
some additional norms. The goal is to consolidate and improve 
trade relations between Venezuela and Brazil, which have 
recently increased but are still insufficient compared with the 
immense possibilities we have in different trade sectors. 
  [Velasquez] Specifically referring to the Brazilians' case, 
I have had the opportunity to discuss a specific proposal. All 
the agreements that the Venezuelan Government has to establish 
with the Brazilian Government should include a specific 
agreement with the Roraima State Government, because we believe 
Roraima State has become an excellent supply center, or 
logistics support center, for illegal miners, meaning the 
garimpeiros. In addition, this has to be discussed at length 
because the latest information we have, based on investigations 
that have been conducted, is that the garimpeiros are not just 
involved in illegal gold mining activities. They also act as 
scouts and guard beachheads for drug trafficking activities, and 
the illegal landing strips built by them are later used for drug 
trafficking. [end recording]

  [Text] In the Venezuelan city of La Guaira, the presidents 
of Brazil and Venezuela released a joint communique this 
afternoon, confirming the two countries' goal of giving new 
impetus to their economic and political relations. 
  [Begin journalist Antonio Carlos Silva recording] At the 
official residence of La Guzmania here in La Guaira, 30 km from 
Caracas, the presidents of Brazil and Venezuela, Itamar Franco 
and Rafael Caldera respectively, released a joint communique 
this afternoon, confirming the two countries' political 
willingness to give new impetus 4o their bilateral relations. 
As part of this effort, they decided to form a bilateral 
commission, chaired by the foreign ministers of the two 
countries, to raise common issues. This commission will form 
work groups to design projects in the electrical, highway, 
hydrographical, mining, iron and steel, and environmental fields. 
  The presidents of Brazil and Venezuela proposed that the 
ministers involved in the commercial area speed up the 
preparations for signing an economic accord. 
  They discussed the Brazilian proposal to create a free trade 
zone, without excluding other current regional integration 
mechanisms, and decided to continue their talks on this issue. 
  The two presidents also proposed discussing ways to increase 
Brazilian purchases of Venezuelan oil. They agreed to promote 
efforts to develop the border areas, especially the Indian 
communities. 
  The joint communique was released at 1230 today after a 
two-hour meeting between the two presidents. 
  Presidents Itamar Franco and Rafael Caldera had lunch 
together and President Itamar Franco then had a free afternoon. 
He is scheduled to return to Brasilia on 5 March. [end 
recording] 
  President Itamar Franco confirmed that by converting wages 
into URV's [Real Value Units], they will not lose their value. 
Therefore, he believes that the mechanism proposed by Congress 
for adjusting wages against inflation is unnecessary. 
  Following the release of the joint communique, President 
Itamar Franco held a news conference during which he criticized 
the activities of oligopolies in Brazil and expressed hope that 
Congress will improve the provisional measure as far as 
oligopolies are concerned. Concerning wage policies, he asked 
that the negotiations be conducted at the ministries and the 
respective business sectors [camaras setoriais]. 
  President Itamar Franco said the government has nothing to 
hide. Therefore, there is no reason for the workers to strike 
when the authorities are open to dialogue. The president added 
that if the workers demonstrate that the wages are actually 
losing their value, the government will obviously take this fact 
into account. 
  Itmar Franco noted that Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso's departure from the government, if it occurs, will not 
hurt the management of the economic program that interests the 
entire country, not just the government.

  [Excerpts] The bill on a special law protecting bank 
depositors and regulating emergencies in financial institutions 
was approved today during a second debate at the Chamber of 
Deputies. 
  The second debates on the special law lasted approximately 
12 
hours; it was finally approved at 1230 today, after an agreement 
was reached on the final procedures. 
  The law, which has 70 articles, stipulates the titles of 
Banco Latino depositors will be recognized regardless of the 
legal body that issued it, as long as the transaction was made 
at Banco Latino. The law also permits the flexibility of 
financial aid [auxilio financiero] and expands control of banks 
receiving financial aid to the point the board of directors can 
be replaced while assistance is being received. Fogade [Deposit 
Guarantee Fund] will be responsible for 4 million bolivares. 
[passage omitted] 
  The bill approved by the Chamber of Deputies was sent this 
afternoon to the Senate, where, as the Congress president said, 
it will be given constitutional urgency; therefore, the Senate 
debates will begin 3 March.

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano; from "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The president hopes that the implementation of the 
so-called Sosa Plan will bring in 400 billion bolivares. The 
Sosa Plan comprises five changes to the country's current tax 
collection system. These changes are: taxes on luxury and 
wholesale items, which will replace the VAT [Value Added Tax], 
and modification of laws covering fiscal stamps, tax code, 
income tax, and a temporary tax on bank debits. All of these 
will allow the president, according to the finance minister, to 
collect about 400 billion boliavares and reduce the fiscal 
deficit to 2 percent of the GNP. 
  During his talks, Finance Minister Dr. Julio Sosa Rodriguez 
explained that the tax on bank deposits would be effective only 
up to 31 December and will yield 75 billion bolivares in six 
months. 
  [Begin Sosa recording] It is a type of tax that one would 
not 
like to have permanently, but we have seen the results in other 
countries where it has been applied. Therefore, what we are 
going to propose is a figure, which I believe when applied for a 
limited amount of time will not adversely affect savings. [end 
recording] 
  The finance minister also expressed satisfaction with the 
establishment of the fiscal police. According to the 
Comptroller General's Office, current tax evasion hovers around 
70 percent. It is hoped that with this new organization, tax 
evasion will be reduced to at least 50 percent. 
  The finance minister also mentioned he did not understand 
the 
Senate's objection to Carlos Tinoco's candidacy to head Fogade 
[Deposit Guarantee Fund] -- a candidacy proposed by the 
president; nevertheless, Sosa said he would heed the decision.

<F P=106> [Report by Igor Garcia] </F>
  [Text] The Venezuelan Government has verified through 
Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Arieta that it has no plans to 
increase the price of gasoline this year. Nevertheless, it 
indicated that no plan is definite and any plan, within a 
corporate structure, is subject to revision and cost analysis. 
  The energy and mines minister made this statement when a 
television reporter asked him about the main aspects of the 
situation the nation's petroleum industry is going through. The 
reporter's first question referred to gasoline prices, taking 
into account that it is one of the causes for the deterioration 
of Petroven's [Venezuelan Petroleum] revenues and diverse 
sectors of the national economy have recommended an increase. 
  Although he said several times that the increase would not 
be 
implemented, he hinted that an increase has not been ruled out 
of the nation's political-economic panorama. Moreover, the 
minister said Petroven's plans and projects are constantly being 
reviewed. 
  When asked about the tax the UK announced for Orimolsion and 
the restrictions the United States imposed on Venezuelan 
gasoline exports beginning 1995, he said: "...petroleum is a 
substance that has global nationality and as such it is a 
foreign policy issue. Each nation has tendencies to protect 
their own industry, their own markets," Arrieta noted. The 
Orimulsion case is different than the U.S. gasoline case. For 30 
years, this nation has provided its government with the 
possibility of levying a tax to protect its domestic industry... 
currently this is not what is occurring. Reformulated gasoline 
is another problem. 
  "Some companies, whose product competes with our gasoline in 
the United States, claim that our gas does not meet 
environmental requirements. This is utterly false; we have 
proven that we are in compliance with the standards established, 
and we have pointed out that we are being discriminated 
against.... We are currently holding cordial negotiations, and I 
am sure the problem will be resolved." 
  As for Orimulsion, he said there have always been taxes on 
the import of a number of products. In this case, due to the 
existence of large coal deposits, an effort has been made to 
protect this industry by levying a tax. He added, however, that 
the current negotiations will yield a solution that will benefit 
the two parties. 
  As for problems that could arise within the industry 
regarding investments and expenses due to the dramatic levels 
reached by the price of oil, Erwin Arrieta, former diplomat and 
current minister, vowed that plans to maintain the industry's 
production potential and the expansion of production of some 
products will not be affected so as to not alter the nation's 
future income generated by this industry. 
  The minister was reminded that National Convergence, which 
helped President Rafael Caldera reach power, did not agree with 
some association contracts signed during the administrations of 
Carlos Andres Perez and Ramon J. Velasquez. The Cristobal Colon 
Project was cited as an example. A Convergence member questioned 
its authenticity and even took this case to the Supreme Court of 
Justice to have it repealed. 
  Arrieta's lengthy explanation included experiences of his 30 
years in the oil industry and the absence of an oil doctrine. 
He recalled a decree issued by Liberator Simon Bolivar in 1829; 
the decree ratified what the Indian Laws have established for 
products found in the subsoil. Finally, Arrieta praised the 
energy ministry's employees, who work tirelessly despite their 
low salaries.

<F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Mateus; from the "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Rear Admiral Hernan Gruber Odreman, leader of the 27 
November 1992 military uprising, as well as four other officers 
and a civilian were released this morning. They were all 
beneficiaries of the pardon announced by President Rafael 
Caldera. 
  Rear Admiral Gruber Odreman abandoned his sickbed at the 
military hospital and before going home to continue resting on 
the recommendation of his doctors, who had performed surgery on 
him, he stopped to talk to journalists. At that time he 
justified the military uprisings in many ways. He said his 
plans were for the president's pardon to benefit him once all 
the subordinates who accompanied him during the 27 November 
uprising are released. However, since that is not currently the 
case, he did not ask for a discharge. 
  [Begin Gruber recording] Undoubtedly, no one should be 
afraid. I -- and I am sure the same went for my companeros -- 
never had the idea of rebelling against the government. I want 
to emphatically state, however, that we have always observed the 
laws and the regulations of the armed institution. We heeded 
the spirit of Article 28 of the National Armed Forces Law, which 
more or less states: No one is forced to do more than is 
demanded of him but in all unforeseen accidents or incidents 
military officers must join the ranks leading toward the banners 
that are most fitting for military honor. We, therefore, ask 
ourselves: What banners are we going to follow? I am referring 
to the circumstances under which we were forced to rebel. 
Should we join the black banner of the nation's moral and 
physical rottenness or the banner of dignity, honor, and 
justice? That was the feeling and spirit of all my companeros 
that led us to rebel at that time. I do not believe the same 
conditions exist under the present circumstances because the 
leader of the nation is a man in whom all Venezuelans and 
especially the officers of the National Armed Forces have placed 
their trust. [end recording] 
  Later, General Raul Alejandro Salazar, chief of the 3d 
Infantry Division, pointed out that President Caldera also 
pardoned the following persons: 
  [Begin Salazar recording] Today the president of the 
Republic 
pardoned Rear Adm. Hernan Gruber Odreman, Aviation Lieutenant 
Luis Miguel Magallanes Andrades, Aviation Lt. Rafael Arturo 
Brito, Aviation Lt. Edgar (Cruz) Arteaga, National Guard Lt. 
Franklin Garcia Duque, and citizen German Robles. [end recording] 
  Rear Adm. Gruber Odreman said that he is willing to request 
his discharge from the Armed Forces just as he had announced 
when he met with the president of the Republic.

  [Text] Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier 
said here today the governments of Panama and Costa Rica are 
complying with their bilateral agreements to both countries' 
benefit. 
  [Begin recording] [Calderon] We have maintained the best 
relations with President Endara's government. Our people have 
always maintained good relations in the past and, undoubtably, 
will continue to do so in the future with the new Costa Rican 
president as of May and with whomever you elect to govern Panama 
during the 8 May elections. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What is the status of bilateral 
trade 
between Panama and Costa Rica? Is there anything new? 
  [Calderon] There is nothing new. Very small differences have 
appeared regarding certain products, but through dialogue, as we 
have always done, Panama and Costa Rica have managed to reach an 
agreement and resolve our differences. [end recording]

  [Text] Panamanian President Guillermo Endara and Costa 
Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier spoke to 
Telemetro about topics of national and international interest. 
  [Begin recording] [Calderon] Specifically, we had nothing to 
discuss regarding bilateral issues. We discussed problems with 
our banana policy toward Europe and the possibility of 
banana-producing countries meeting in Panama in the next 10 or 
15 days to establish a joint position toward Europe. 
  [Unidentified reporter] How would you assess the work done 
by 
your administration at the conclusion of your presidential term? 
  [Calderon] I am very satisfied with the work I did. The most 
important thing is not how I view it but how the people view it. 
In recent polls, 70 percent of the population said government 
action was satisfactory, 9 percent thought it was bad, and the 
rest of the population did not comment. This is really 
extraordinary. 
  [Reporter] In what condition will the government be when you 
transfer it to President-Elect Figueres? 
  [Calderon] We had the highest growth rate for Latin America 
last year. Unemployment is at 4 percent and there was a 
reduction of poverty levels. With this, I will pass the 
government on to him in an exceptional condition to continue 
moving toward development. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, are you confident [Costa Rican] 
Foreign Minister Niehaus will be elected to the post of OAS 
secretary general? 
  [Calderon] I have never been confident of any election. I am 
used to fighting to the end to win. We have received, in 
writing, the formal support of 22 nations of the continent. 
Only 18 votes are required to win, and we trust the 22 nations 
that have supported us. We are certain none of them will let us 
down. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, President Endara assessed the talks held with his 
Costa Rican colleague. 
  [Begin recording] [Endara] Costa Rica has asked Panama to 
invite the other Latin American banana-producing countries to 
meet here to see if we can reach an accord on this issue because 
no agreement had been reached. I think Calderon's visit was 
very positive from the standpoint of banana production. [end 
recording] 
  After a three-day visit to Panama, Costa Rican President 
Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier returned to his country today. 
Panamanian President Guillermo Endara Galimany, accompanied by 
Vice President Guillermo Ford, bid Calderon goodbye at the 
Marcos Gelabert Airport in Paitilla. The Chamber of Commerce, 
Industries, and Agriculture invited the Costa Rican president to 
Panama to inaugurate the 12th version of the Expo-Comer 
Commercial Exhibit.

  [Text] Panama City, 4 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, Panamanian 
President Guillermo Endara revealed that drug operations are 
coordinated with the United States, Spain, Colombia, and Central 
American countries to prevent drug traffickers from "filtering 
their dirty money" into Panama's political and economic sectors. 
"I handle a great deal of confidential information on this 
issue. We have arrested several drug traffickers and we have 
found out the money is moved immediately," Endara told ACAN-EFE 
during an interview held in his office. The Panamanian 
president, who chose not to reveal specific, coordinated cases 
of drug operations, emphasized there is "very extensive" 
cooperation with the United States, Spain, Colombia, Costa Rica, 
Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. 
  Endara said cases in which drug traffickers have been 
arrested, released, and allowed to leave the country have 
occurred many times and cannot be considered isolated events. 
"All of a sudden, we find the drug trafficker is set free and 
allowed to leave the country. It is a worldwide known fact that 
the drug business pays a lot of bribes (illegal money 
commissions)," explained the president regarding the mysterious 
releases. Endara said he has held meetings with Supreme Court 
justices and personnel from the Attorney General's Office to get 
them to adopt measures aimed at preventing such events from 
occurring again. 
  The president, however, emphasized that it is necessary to 
improve the current law on drug trafficking activities. He 
insisted on the need to approve the draft bill he had sent to 
the Attorney General's Office, which the parliament 
"significantly" improved. The new antidrug draft bill introduces 
the figure of a secret agent, which is not included in the 
current law. 
  Endara said it is "absurd" that the same penalties that 
imposed on drug traffickers be applied to a secret agent if 
arrested by the police. He added that agents that infiltrate 
receive the same penalties as drug traffickers who deliver or 
receive drugs. If a secret agent is sent to jail, "we move 
heaven and earth" to get him released. Nobody, however, wants 
to be a secret agent if there are no laws to protect him, the 
president indicated. 
  Last Tuesday, during the inauguration of the parliament's 
last period of sessions, Endara said Panama is being threatened 
by drug trafficking activities, drug use, and money laundering. 
He also asked deputies to combat drug trafficking activities 
and their effects on the country's economic, social, and 
political life. He called on the deputies to approve the new 
law so as to be able to fight this "imported scourge" more 
efficiently.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriela Sagel] </F>
  [Text] Acting Attorney General Bolivar Davalos recognized 
that the job done by U.S. federal narcotics agents in covert 
operations is an act against the country's sovereignty. Davalos 
indicated that the procedures followed by the covert agents in 
Panama are not legal. Because of this we have to be very careful 
because it is a direct act against our sovereignty. 
  The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty has not yet been approved 
by the U.S. Senate, and, therefore, the operations conducted by 
the DEA agents are illegal, the acting Attorney General said. 
According to Davalos, at no time since he has been in charge of 
the Attorney General's Office have U.S. narcotics officials 
requested authorization to operate in the country. 
  Covert U.S. federal agents, in an operation set up a year 
and 
a half ago, intercepted more than $10 million in drug 
trafficking money in which lawyers, accountants, and Panamanian 
and Colombian businessmen are allegedly involved. 
  Among those accused are Frank L. Greene, the vice president 
of the firm Merrill Lynch International in Panama; Steven L. 
Mills, a top official of the same firm; and Panamanians Ricardo 
Leyton, a lawyer; Charles Richard McFaden, an accountant; and 
businessman Luis Sanchez. Also involved are Jorge Rogelio 
Krupnik, Gilberto Straub and his son, Jorge Rivera, and Patrick 
Van Duel, who according to the list is an official at the 
Colabanco Bank. The bank, however, has stated that Van Duel no 
longer works for them. 
  The acting attorney general pointed out that any procedure 
or 
probe conducted by the Panamanian Government on those involved 
in the drug trafficking network discovered by the federal agents 
has to be conducted through the Foreign Ministry. Likewise, any 
protest by the Panamanian Government toward the United States 
for the covert work performed by the DEA agents has to be filed 
by the Foreign Ministry, from whom a statement in this regard is 
expected. 
  Meanwhile, Hernan Rubio, president of the Bar Association, 
said the entire drug trafficking network discovered by the 
United States is part of a campaign to discredit the country.

<F P=106> [Report by Roxana Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Eduardo Vallarino, Christian Democratic Party [PDC] 
presidential candidate, said yesterday "the United States has 
not yet ratified the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between 
Panama and the United States, because that country's Senate 
distrusts Panamanian authorities. [no closing quotation mark as 
published] 
  Vallarino said the economic stagnation as well as 
nonratification of the treaty, which promotes the exchange of 
drug-trafficking data between the two countries, are due to a 
great extent to the distrust of certain senators toward 
Panamanian authorities. 
  The candidate said certain senators fear information given 
to 
Panamanian authorities could end up directly in the hands of 
drug traffickers. 
  Vallarino underscored he cannot pass judgment on this, 
because he cannot say Panamanian authorities would indeed be 
capable of supplying information to drug traffickers. The bad 
thing is, he added, that there is doubt about our officials 
abroad and that there is the belief that a treaty of this nature 
should not be signed, because we do not deserve to be trusted. 
  The Christian Democratic candidate said the country has to 
make the work of the judicial branch and Public Prosecutor's 
Office more credible in order to neutralize the scourge of drug 
trafficking and to prevent Panamanians' association with drug 
trafficking. 
  He added Panama must establish special corps to fight drug 
trafficking, because the most serious national security threat 
facing this country is the financial power drug traffickers and 
money launderers have used to buy public institutions and even 
political processes in many countries. 
  In conclusion, Vallarino said if Panama fails to adopt 
measures in this regard, we could end up being bought 
politically by drug traffickers and money launderers.

<F P=106> [Article by Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate </F>
for the Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD] 
  [Text] In some of the meetings I have held in recent weeks, 
I have been asked, particularly by representatives of the 
business sector, about the immediate political future of the 
country in the event my presidential ticket wins the presidency 
in the 1994 elections. These people specifically insisted that 
I outline my thoughts regarding the possibility of restoring a 
military- dictatorial government in the event the alliance 
formed to support my candidacy were to win the elections. 
  On previous occasions and through other means, I have had 
the 
opportunity to refer to the topic. I have pointed out that one 
factor must be taken into consideration: the internal 
transformation -- which was unthinkable in other times -- that 
has taken place within the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] 
regarding its operation. In spite of the complexity of its 
statutes based on a difficult community organization, we have 
complied with all steps required for the democratic selection of 
candidates. 
  Unrestricted nominations and direct and secret elections led 
to an internal mobilization to a degree never seen before. To 
this effect, I am proud to say that the custom of choosing 
leaders and candidates from outside the party according to the 
likes or dislikes of the chiefs of military zones has been 
surpassed. This has led to a democratic practice that 
strengthens party organization; thus the PRD has become an 
important factor in the consolidation of the system. 
  My fellow party members and I are aware that access to state 
leadership is only possible and desirable through respect for 
and compliance with the rules of political coexistence. At the 
proper moment, we rejected all attempts to disturb institutional 
order through acts of force or riots that tried to change the 
structure of the state or stability. More than once, we firmly 
said that any political or military adventure that sought to 
shorten the presidential term of Guillermo Endara would be 
openly rejected by our party. This led to severe criticism by 
some politicized groups for which such a criteria "extended the 
life of Endara's government" and led -- according to them -- to 
a sort of suicide because all hopes for redeeming the country 
were reduced to an electoral result. That was the same time at 
which the proposal for a constituent assembly was promoted, 
based on the erroneous idea that it could direct the course of 
events and substantially change the country's situation if the 
legitimacy of the government was questioned. 
  The aforementioned facts show that the PRD decided to take 
political action within the system, with clean and open cards 
and with a sincere admission of the errors that at one fateful 
moment isolated the party from the majority of the nation. 
Within the PRD, we feel a noble and healthy pride at having 
surmounted such difficult stages and at having reached a new 
democratizing conscience that, in just four years, has turned it 
into an obligated point of reference at the hour of describing 
the national situation. 
  Meanwhile, there is no military group that, for reason of 
any 
political force, can reassume direction and control of public 
functions. Nobody in Panama has that ability to garner 
nationwide support. No one can lead all the driving forces of 
the nation to establish autocratic governments that do not 
comply with the norms of political and social coexistence. 
  To this effect, I think that any president, party, union, or 
group that tries to substitute the laws of political consensus 
with a government that has unrestrained power will be left 
without the national support necessary for its legitimization. 
Consequently, its possibilities for ruling will be reduced to a 
minimum. There is currently no political or social condition 
that will allow the existence of autocratic or dictatorial 
governments. Even at the international level, there is no room 
for new radical experiments, given that the collective 
conscience abroad emphasizes the new paths man must follow, 
greatly concerned over his rights and freedom, without 
forgetting the urgent social needs that have been increasing in 
recent years. 
  Therefore, I point out that the democratic organization 
should try to improve so it will likewise have the ability to 
offer true solutions to the people with fewer resources and will 
grant them the educational instruments to develop in today's 
complex society. 
  The only thing that we ask is that the rules of the game not 
be changed; that it be accepted that we exist; that we 
participate in the system; that we are prepared to win; and that 
our government is completely feasible. It is a simple duty of 
understanding the reality of the country in a mature manner and 
with a sense of responsibility.

Peter Romero's remarks on the Peruvian-Ecuadoran territorial 
dispute. The Foreign Ministry made this statement after Foreign 
Minister Diego Paredes met with the U.S. diplomat, who was 
summoned to explain the remarks he made in an interview 
published by the Guayaquil press. The diplomat said that the 
Ecuadoran people are not prepared to recover their territory by 
the use of arms. 
  The official Ecuadoran statement after the meeting limited 
itself to reporting that the ambassador had been called for 
consultations. Paredes indicated that his office will adopt 
whatever diplomatic measures are warranted and will issue a 
communique in this regard. The Ecuadoran foreign minister 
underscored that Ecuador is very respectful of the internal 
situations of other countries and expects the same treatment.

  [Text] Dr. Francisco Acosta Coloma, energy and mines 
minister, says it necessary to develop productive activities in 
all facets of the electricity sector within a free market 
system. Francisco Acosta says this new trend will allow the 
modernization of the electricity sector because it is not fair 
for the state to reserve for itself the tasks of regulation, 
normalization, and control when it performs none of these 
functions under optimum conditions because it does not have 
adequate resources to update its obsolete equipment. 
  The energy and mines minister also said that oil production 
will increase to 400,00 barrels per day this year. This 
increase in production comes from the (Boyi-Capiron), Tivacuno, 
(Amo), (Daimi), (Ginta), and (Ori) oil fields operated by the 
Matsu company, which will produce an additional 16,500 barrels 
of oil.

Echeverri to Prosecutor General Gustavo De Greiff on 25 February] 
  [Text] Per the conversation we had this morning in which 
you voiced your concern about a statement I allegedly made 
saying this office would stop participating in the surrender to 
justice process of persons allegedly linked to drug trafficking 
in Valle del Cauca, allow me to clarify: 
  The Attorney General's Office will not dissociate itself 
from 
the process inasmuch as Article 44 of Law 81, 1993, establishes 
a clear and legal obligation to directly participate in each of 
the criminal cases that could begin against people who request 
benefits for effectively collaborating with justice, according 
to the terms established in Law 81. 
  It is obvious that the presence of the Attorney General's 
Office, in the conversations that have taken place so far, only 
seeks to learn about the circumstances surrounding the 
establishment of bases that could result in the benefits 
established by the law. 
  As the legal circumstances may merit, the Office of the 
Attorney General of the nation will independently define its 
stand with regard to each case. Yours truly, [Signed] Mauricio 
Echeverri, attorney general of the nation

  [Text] National Drug Directorate Director Gabriel de Vega 
Pinzon has said that the fight against drug trafficking in the 
world has not failed because it has not even begun yet in many 
countries. He did admit that, unfortunately, Colombia continues 
to be the world's top producer and exporter of cocaine. He 
rejected the attempt to label the drug cartels as Colombian and 
complained about the international community's indolence with 
which it treats our country in the face of this problem while 
indirectly benefiting from the illegal activities of drug 
traffickers. 
  De Vega Pinzon noted that a double standard continues to 
exist in sectors of the international community because, on the 
one hand, they try to stigmatize us and call us the big culprits 
in the drug trafficking problem and, on the other hand, they 
fail to see their own faults. 
  He said that despite the cooperation given by some 
countries, 
which makes it reasonable to think this evil will be defeated, 
there are a lot of other countries where the sale of drugs is 
practically free and where bank secrecy laws are so secure that 
they pave the way for laundering large amounts of capital from 
drug trafficking businesses. 
  He concluded that the pressure Colombia has exerted on the 
drug trafficking cartels has been so great that they have been 
forced to expand their organizations to other Latin American 
countries, many of which do not give the importance Colombia 
gives to this problem.

caption] 
  [Text] The International Drug Control Board has pointed out 
that little or nothing has been done to fight drug trafficking 
in Colombia. We asked presidential candidates and hopefuls, if 
elected, how would they confront the problem? How would they 
fight drug trafficking in the country? 
  [Begin recording] [Liberal Party presidential hopeful 
Ernesto 
Samper] The policy that President Cesar Gaviria has been 
implementing is the best: demobilizing the drug cartels and 
subjecting them to the law by offering them a safe prison and a 
fair trial. Legalizing drugs in Colombia is not viable right 
now because people might interpret it as granting amnesty to 
drug trafficking. 
  [Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana] 
I 
insist it cannot be legalized. Statistics from the countries 
that have legalized drugs or from the U.S. states that have 
legalized marijuana always show that consumption has increased. 
This is why I insist on education and prevention programs. 
  [Liberal Party presidential hopeful Humerto De la Calle] I 
say we should broaden drug trafficking policies to ensure that 
developed countries, in particular, become more efficient at 
controlling consumption, money laundering, precursor chemicals, 
and weapons. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Miriam Ortiz; from the "24 Hours Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The defense minister and the Colombian Air Force 
commander have decided to provide an explanation concerning the 
decision to shoot down airplanes which violate Colombian 
airspace. 
  Let us investigate when an airplane may be shot down and 
what 
attitude Air Force pilots must assume, according to the Aviation 
Routes and Procedures Manual. 
  The procedure begins once the airplane is detected by any 
one 
of four military radars located at San Andres, Guajira, 
Araracuara, or Leticia. Normally these planes are tracked from 
the United States by U.S. AWACS airplanes, which later give the 
information to the Colombian radar stations. Then, this signal, 
which is simultaneously received at the National Defense 
Military Headquarters in Bogota, is analyzed. This is where 
they verify if the airplane is legally in transit. If this is 
not the case, they order the closest air base to send A-37, 
Kfir, Mirage, OB-10, or Tucano fighter planes to intercept it. 
  When radio communication is not possible, the intercepting 
aircraft must use the following visual signals: First, move from 
side to side and turn its navigation lights on and off to warn 
the airplane it has been intercepted. Second, abruptly move away 
from the intercepted airplane, making a 90-degree turn upwards 
to tell it to continue. Third, lower the landing gear leaving 
the landing lights on. Then raise the landing gear to notify 
the airplane it must land. Fourth, repeatedly turn all lights on 
and off. If the airplane does not respond it is shot down 
immediately. 
  This norm will be enforced in approximately in 45 days, 
after 
the Civil Aeronautics Board notifies all airplane companies. 
  [Begin recording] [Ortiz] General [Alfonso Abondano, 
commander of the Colombian Air Force], how can you guarantee the 
safety of the pilots who will combat these drug traffickers, 
taking into account that most of the pilots working for drug 
traffickers have worked for the Air Force or have been Air Force 
pilots? 
  [Abondano] We locate the airplanes through the Air Defense's 
Military Center. Once intercepted, our pilots cannot say they 
do not have the airplane in sight. [end recording] 
  According to the defense minister this decision was adopted 
because approximately 600 clandestine airplanes fly over 
Colombian territory each year.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 6 Mar (EFE) -- Authorities 
reported that at least five people were injured today, Sunday, 
when two unidentified people on a motorcycle threw a bomb into 
the "Rancho Tropical" pavilion in Barranquilla, northern 
Colombia. Senator Fuad Char Abdala had just left the scene when 
the bomb exploded. According to the polls, Fuad Char Abdala is 
the Liberal Party candidate who will receive the most votes in 
the 13 March legislative elections. Char Abdala had presided 
over the closing ceremony for his political campaign at the 
aforementioned location. 
  The "Rancho Tropical" in southern Barranquilla was destroyed 
by the fire sparked by the bomb. Owner Guillermo Min told the 
police that he had no enemies, thus he believes that the attack 
was aimed at Char Abdala. The senator was the development 
minister between 1988 and 1990 and now hopes to be reelected to 
the Senate. 
  Fortunately the bomb was thrown 30 minutes after the 
political event had ended, and the liberal leader's followers 
had already left the scene. The five people who were injured 
sustained minor cuts when several windows were broken. The 
individuals were taken to a medical center, where it was 
determined that none had suffered serious injuries.

  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff says he regrets 
the fact that members of the Catholic Church are holding 
permanent talks with the guerrillas. De Greiff was referring to 
San Gil Bishop Monsignor Leonardo Gomez' admission to having 
held such meetings. 
  In statements to the Colmundo Radio Network, the official 
said: "I think it is regrettable that a bishop has become a 
mailbox for subversives." 
  The prelate said on 24 February that he met "with the FARC 
[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] 23d Front." He also 
said this guerrilla organization "did not perpetrate some crimes 
attributed to it in Velez Province; paramilitary groups did." 
  De Greiff responded to those statements. When asked about 
the legal repercussions for such actions, he said that "one 
characteristic of the state of law is that no one is above the 
law, not even the most dignified person. No one can feel free 
to dictate his own behavioral guidelines." 
  De Greiff added: "If the law that Colombians have approved 
forbids talking with subversives, then everybody must obey it: 
the president of the Republic, the bishops, and even the most 
humble Colombian." 
  Two months ago, on 17 January, Santander authorities blamed 
the 23d Front for perpetrating a bloody and vicious attack on 
the Florian community that left five policemen dead. 
  On August 1993, the National Committee of Victims of the 
Guerrillas [Comite Nacional de Victimas de la Guerrilla] (Vida), 
headed by lawyer Fernando Vargas, personally filed charges 
against Bishop Gomez at the Prosecutor General's Office for 
allegedly being an accomplice to and aiding and abetting the 
subversives.

<F P=106> [Report by Raul Gutierrez; from the "24 Hours" Newscast] </F>
  [Text] Monsignor Pedro Rubiano, Bishops Conference 
president, has issued an official communique on behalf of the 
Catholic Church regarding the confrontation between bishops and 
the Prosecutor General's Office. Monsignor Rubiano sent a 
letter to Government Minister Fabio Villegas and Prosecutor 
General Gustavo de Greiff today to clarify the conduct of 
certain bishops in Apartado and San Gil. 
  This communique has been issued at a time when the 
prosecutor 
general has questioned recent contacts between several bishops 
in various regions of the country with subversive groups, 
particularly the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the 
National Liberation Army. The church has assumed a position, 
and the government, specifically the prosecutor general and the 
attorney general, another. Here is Raul Gutierrez with a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Gutierrez] In his letter to Villegas, 
Monsignor Rubiano asks him to indicate before the Bishops 
Permanent Committee how the bishops' conduct has interfered with 
the peace process or the justice system. 
  [Rubiano] Bishops do not collaborate with guerrillas; what 
we 
try to do is accomplish a mission, namely, to make room so that 
Constitutional Article 22 is complied with. 
  [Gutierrez] In his letter to Prosecutor General de Greiff, 
Monsignor Rubiano asks him to draw a line to separate pastoral 
duties from politics. Meanwhile, Manizales Bishop Monsignor 
Jose de Jesus Pimento said de Greiff was too hasty. 
  [Pimento] It was all a mistake by Prosecutor de Greiff, who 
has expressed his political view. The bishop he has mentioned 
has engaged in pastoral talks. He works in a very difficult 
area and has talked with the guerrillas to urge them to change 
their attitude. 
  [Gutierrez] The Government Minister will meet with the 
bishops during the week of 7 March. [end recording]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 6 Mar (EFE) -- The Colombian 
Government today guaranteed that elections would be held on 13 
March despite recent disruptions of public order. Government 
Minister Fabio Villegas Ramirez and Defense Minister Rafael 
Pardo Rueda both made statements to that effect. Defense 
Minister Pardo Rueda said the executive branch can guarantee 
that elections will be held thanks to the implementation of the 
"Democracy Plan." Effective today, at least 52,000 members of 
the Colombian Armed Forces will participate in the "Democracy 
Plan" to reinforce security at all strategic locations, 
political campaign headquarters, and public buildings. Many 
parts of the country that have experienced public order problems 
in the past few weeks will be given special protection. 
  Minister Villegas urged Colombians to vote, noting that "the 
best way to face violence is by going to the polls, which will 
strengthen democracy." 
  The Army, Air Force, Navy, and police force will participate 
in the "Democracy Plan." 
  Defense Minister Pardo Rueda said "the rebels are not 
capable 
of stopping the elections. They are only trying to cause alarm 
and make their presence known through their barbaric actions." 
Pardo Rueda added that guerrilla actions during the past few 
weeks, such as placing mines in agricultural areas, "have been 
irrational." The defense minister admitted that the kidnapping 
of congressional candidates, mayors, and other leaders, along 
with clashes in some parts of the country, have disrupted public 
order. Nevertheless, the government "has not had to postpone or 
cancel elections anywhere in the country," he added. 
  Colombians will go to the polls on 13 March to elect 163 
representatives and 100 senators. 
  In addition, the Liberal Party will hold a consultation to 
choose its candidate for the May elections among seven 
presidential hopefuls.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Colombian elections 
scheduled for 8 May 1994; source follows in parentheses after 
each item. 
  According to a poll by EL TIEMPO and the National Advisory 
Center (CNC) conducted from 6 to 10 February in 22 cities, 
Liberal Party (PL) candidate hopeful Ernesto Samper Pizano is 
ahead with 39 percent of the votes while Andres Pastrana Arango, 
of the New Democratic Force (NDF), follows with 32 percent. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 20 Feb 94 pp 1a, 6a) 
  Samper Pizano has proposed all political parties, social 
movements, and candidates running for office should "join in an 
antiviolence crusade." He added the flare-up of violence is 
aimed at "frightening the country and preventing the 13 March 
elections." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 23 Feb 
94 p 7a) 
  Both Pastrana Arango and Samper Pizano continue to campaign 
in Antioquia and Cauca Departments, explaining their economic 
and social proposals. Both candidates are fighting for women's 
vote as they announced programs to give women a more active role 
in society and to protect children in the poorer areas. (Santa 
Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 25 Feb 94 p 7a) 
  Senator Regina Betancur de Liska, presidential candidate 
from 
the Metapolitical Unitary Movement, began yesterday a tour of 
the country in Leticia, Amazonas Department. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 24 Feb 94 p 6a) 
  Meanwhile, Humberto de la Calle Lombana, PL candidate 
hopeful, has said there is no way to keep nonparty members from 
voting in the PL party convention slated for 13 March. When 
asked if he would accept being the vice president running mate 
for Pastrano Arango, de la Calle Lombana answered: "I believe I 
am going to become the president of the Republic, and I am not 
hoping for any consolation prizes." (Santa Fe de Bogota 
Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 3 Mar 94)

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 5 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Colombian 
Mines Minister Guido Nule denied today any agreement had been 
signed with Cuba on oil matters, but he said the terms to 
formalize "a possible commercial agreement for the sale of 
crude" are being studied. 
  The government of President Cesar Gaviria announced last 
week 
it would supply Cuba with approximately 20,000 barrels of oil 
daily under normal trade conditions and at international market 
prices. 
  The Colombian decision has caused uneasiness among the 
Miami-based Cuban community, which has agreed to stage protest 
marches in Florida and block products from that South American 
country that are sold in U.S. stores. 
  In a preliminary reaction, approximately 30 anti-Castro 
exiles demonstrated in front of the Colombian Consulate in Miami 
yesterday to voice their disconformity with the aid Gaviria's 
administration is giving to Fidel Castro's government. 
  Colombia cannot subject or condition its international trade 
policy to public demonstrations, Nule stated at a news 
conference this afternoon, referring to the protests initiated 
yesterday by Cuban exiles in Miami. 
  "I do not think Colombia can subject or condition its policy 
to public demonstrations," the minister said, insisting Cuban 
exiles have "a high sensitivity, and one must understand it." 
  Nule said any operation carried out with Havana "will be 
carried out within the strict practices of international trade." 
  "There is no agreement at this time, and we are only 
studying 
the terms of a possible agreement, such as payment guarantees, 
volume, and quality," he explained. 
  Cuba is an important market, and Colombia cannot see any 
reason why it cannot sell fuel to the Caribbean island, 
according to the minister.

  [Text] Live, from the Civil Defense command post in Plaza 
[de la Revolucion] Municipality, we received news of the tour 
made last night by President Fidel Castro, which lasted into the 
wee hours of this morning, as well as about the news conference 
held there. From Edelberto Garcia, at the command post, we have 
a report: 
  [Garcia] Good morning, "First Thing in the Morning" 
listeners. 
  In the wee hours this morning, Commander in Chief Fidel 
Castro visited the command post of the Defense Council of Plaza 
de la Revolucion Municipality, which was activated yesterday in 
view of possible imminent storm surges along this part of the 
Havana coastline. So far, however, there have been only slight 
surges. 
  Fidel arrived at this coordinating point for the 
municipality 
-- which is located at the headquarters of the Communist Party 
of Cuba [PCC] -- at 0220 and quickly asked how penetration by 
the sea might affect the area. This is the second threat of 
storm surges so far this year. 
  (Eduardo Tejera), PCC first secretary in Plaza de la 
Revolucion Municipality, briefed the leader of the Revolution on 
the measures that have been taken, which include the moving of 
all foodstuffs from gastronomic and commercial centers, the 
cleaning of storm drains, and the evacuation of 50 percent of 
the tourists lodged at the Habana Riviera Hotel. 
  Fidel explained that he had visited the Riviera Hotel area 
and had been able to see the measures that had been taken, as 
well as the retaining wall built recently in front of the hotel 
to reduce the effect of the waves. In this connection, he 
explained the importance of providing protective mechanisms for 
any new hotels that may be built in these areas because 
everything seems to indicate that, as a result of several 
phenomena, these surges will tend to increase. 
  Fidel pointed out: We have already had two threats this 
year; 
and this one is still not over, because there will be another 
high tide at noon today and with it returns the threat of 
possible flooding in low-lying areas of five municipalities in 
this capital. 
  The commander in chief had a long and pleasant talk with 
reporters until after 0330. Fidel insisted -- and I wish to 
stress this to our listeners -- on his concern that the 
population remain attentive to the reports issued by the weather 
institute in the next few hours. By the way, there will be a 
meeting at approximately 0700 today at the headquarters of this 
city's provincial government to take specific measures in this 
connection. 
  This has been Edelberto Garcia, reporting from the command 
post of the Defense Council of Plaza de la Revolucion 
Municipality for "First Thing in the Morning."

<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Valeriano Giron] </F>
  [Text] The Liberal Party hierarchy met today with President 
Carlos Roberto Reina and his main advisers to discuss issues 
related to the country's political situation. President Carlos 
Roberto Reina stated the following: 
  [Begin Reina recording] The entire ministers cabinet met 
with 
the members of the Central Executive Council. The meeting took 
place in an extremely frank and open manner. It is no surprise 
to anyone that every new administration must confront situations 
that may tarnish the normal manner in which governments are 
conformed. There are commitments by party leaders which must be 
met. Someone who participated in the meeting said that it is a 
very difficult task for a politician who has promised certain 
things during the campaign to visit the ministers and high 
government officials because they always find some problems to 
solve at that exact moment. That is something normal because on 
the one hand the ministers and officials are organizing and 
tremendous expectations are created during the election 
campaign. In addition, there is little time to solve every 
expectation in detail, and most of all in such a short period of 
time. 
  I have already announced that next Monday I will address the 
nation where I will talk about two fundamental issues: first the 
current state of the nation as well as how we received it, and 
secondly, a detailed government program for the next four years. 
The purpose of this meeting was to create fluid communications 
so that the high government officials who do not have sufficient 
time due to valid reasons, may proceed to honor campaign 
promises through responsible persons appointed in each of the 
ministries to undertake such a task. There are political 
commitments that were made during the campaign and we plan to 
honor them. In addition, we have also scheduled a meeting with 
the Liberal Party bloc to prevent any misunderstandings. I was 
extremely satisfied when Mr. Jaime Rosenthal Oliva, a very 
important Liberal Party leader, expressed his genuine 
acknowledgement of our efforts. [end recording] 
  With respect to the numerous demands by Liberal party 
activists who want a position within the government, President 
Carlos Roberto Reina stated as follows. 
  [Begin recording] [Reina] We covered the issue, but it is 
not 
easy to find openings to the nearly 1 million votes we obtained 
during the elections. That is impossible. But what we do seek 
to do is implement some mechanism whereby a head of a department 
or even a deputy will have access to the ministers of the 
autonomous institutions to find selection mechanism that are 
just and fair. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [Reina] I would say a sort of modus operandi as they say in 
international vernacular. [end recording] 
  One month after taking office, President Reina pointed out 
that he had already made some important decisions, but that he 
has stepped aside and delegated responsibilities to some of his 
ministers. 
  [Begin Reina recording] Previously, a president was someone 
who would sit at his desk simply signing agreements affecting 
the lowest janitor and the highest government official. I have 
passed on some responsibilities to the appropriate ministers, 
and reserved some duties for myself. A president who simply 
sits and signs documents is a president who cannot work and does 
not make the political decisions he must constantly make. I 
have already made some political decisions. For example, I have 
delimited the border with the Republic of El Salvador. That is 
a national objective which we plan to carry out and explain 
shortly. Tomorrow I have a meeting planned at the Foreign 
Ministry to discuss the issue, and we cannot procrastinate any 
longer on this issue which is so crucial to Honduras. [end 
recording] 
  With respect to this issue, President Reina indicated that 
during the first 15 days of March he plans to visit the 
territories recovered from El Salvador especially (Nawaterique) 
and Dolores. The objective of the visit is to speak to residents 
of the region as well as to confirm the effectiveness of the 
border demarcation.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 4 Mar (EFE) -- 
"Subcommander" Marcos, leader of the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army (EZLN), has said the sole possibility of peace 
in Mexico is that other civilian forces make a commitment to the 
cause and force the government to comply with the agreements. 
  In statements published today in the daily "LA JORNADA," the 
Zapatist leader indicated that the EZLN hoped that "war would be 
staved off by the pressures exerted by the civil society and the 
whole nation for the agreements to be kept." The government 
"will only comply if it is forced to do so, and this will be by 
the force of the rifle or by society's pressure," insisted the 
leader of the Chiapas rebels. For Marcos, "the sole possibility 
of peace is for other forces to make a commitment to oblige the 
government to keep the agreements." 
  One day after his return to the Lacandona Jungle in Chiapas 
where the Zapatists took shelter to ask the Indian communities' 
opinion on the agreements made with the government, Marcos 
declared that the problem is no longer the rebels', but the 
nation's as a whole. "The government will have to fight against 
its past to convince the communities that it will now meet its 
commitments," the Zapatist "subcommander" stressed. 
  Marco made a brief analysis of the 63-day armed rebellion in 
which he accepted military defeat in the taking over of Rancho 
Nuevo where an Army garrison is located. He also admitted that 
"the swift manner in which we passed from the armed situation to 
the San Cristobal table took us by surprise." 
  He stressed that during the rebellion the EZLN "General 
Command received numerous letters of support from Indian from 
other parts of the nation in which they also stated their desire 
to join up in arms, among them the Yaquis, Mayos, Tarahumaras, 
and Maya tribes. 
  The 19 representatives of the EZLN directorate returned on 
Thursday to the Lacandona Jungle after an 11-day dialogue with 
Manuel Camacho Solis, government delegate for peace and 
reconciliation, with whom several agreements were reached. 
These include the government's response to the Zapatists' main 
demands.

  [Text] La Paz, 4 Mar (EFE) -- Radio Panamericana reported 
here that Susana Seleme, former President Jaime Paz Zamora's 
private secretary, was arrested today in the city of Santa Cruz 
on charges of alleged involvement in the drug trade. 
  Seleme's arrest was neither confirmed nor denied by Interior 
Minister German Quiroga. Seleme is considered to have been one 
of Paz Zamora's closest aides both during and after his 
presidential tenure. 
  Quiroga stated that he could not talk about arrests or 
arrest 
warrants because this is a confidential matter. He did not rule 
out, however, the arrest of other politicians linked to Paz 
Zamora's administration (1989-93).

  [Text] Santiago, 3 Mar (EFE) -- The Latin America and 
Caribbean countries are making progress toward the establishment 
of national authorities that will prevent the production, 
transportation, and trade of chemical weapons in the area. 
  The Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs today released the 
documents produced by the last regional seminar on this subject, 
which was held in Santiago last September. 
  The report stresses that each country must establish a 
national authority that will prohibit in their respective 
territories or in any place under their control the existence of 
chemical weapons, trade in elements for their manufacturing, or 
research to develop this kind of war materiel. 
  The documents point out that countries like Argentina, Cuba, 
Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela are concerned with preventing 
impediments to economic and technological development in the 
area, and with establishing solid bases for trade in chemical 
substances not suitable for war use.

  [Text] Montevideo, 26 Feb (EFE) -- Favored by a "cheap 
dollar" and low import duties, the Uruguayan public purchased 
during 1993 a record figure of imported cars, food, drinks, 
electric appliances, and clothes. 
  The trend leading Uruguayan companies to purchase imported 
machinery has continued on a constant basis since 1989, and 
increased during 1993. 
  This consumption trend and the preference for foreign 
products have led Uruguay to end 1993 with a $679 million trade 
deficit, a historical record. 
  Exports, which dropped by 3.4 percent, remain stable between 
$1.6 and $1.7 billion dollars. 
  The $679 million trade balance deficit is due to a trade 
opening process combined with a low dollar exchange rate in real 
terms, which stimulates imports. 
  Uruguay last year imported $543 million worth of electric 
machines and appliances; $407 million worth of cars; $1.126 
billion worth of textiles and clothes; and $300 million worth of 
food and drinks. 
  Many of the imported products competed with local products, 
making domestic prices drop. 
  The import of consumer products increased the most (43 
percent) during 1993, but capital goods also increased (13 
percent), especially in machinery and equipment. 
  The unequal evolution of inflation (52.86 percent during 
1993) and the devaluation of the Uruguayan peso in comparison 
with the dollar (26.88 percent during the same year) made 
Uruguayan products less competitive. 
  This situation, which has stagnated Uruguayan exports, has 
generated harsh criticism and claims from Uruguayan exporters. 
  Export volume has remained stable over the last five years, 
but its composition has changed significantly. 
  While traditional exports (beef, leather, wool) constituted 
45 percent of total exports in 1983, they only constituted 26 
percent of total exports in 1993. 
  Textile products and beef exports, despite a drop of 16 and 
19 percent respectively in 1993 in comparison with 1992, 
continue to lead sales abroad. 
  As for the principal imports, they continue to be those 
meant 
for consumption. Imported car sales hit the record figure of 
31,335 in 1993, which is 68 percent more than 1992. Food and 
drink imports increased by 43 percent. 
  Consumer goods imports increased by 315 percent over the 
past 
four years, while capital goods imports increased 144 percent. 
  Brazil became Uruguay's main trade partner in 1993, as 
Brazilian exports to Uruguay increased by 30 percent while 
Uruguayan exports to Brazil increased by 24 percent, thus 
surpassing Argentina which up until now had been Uruguay's main 
trade partner. 
  Imports from the United States dropped by 16 percent in 
1993. 
Imports from the European Union dropped by 20 percent, while 
those from the rest of Europe dropped by 37 percent. Asian 
imports dropped by 11 percent during the same year.

  [Text] Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro last night 
decorated Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani with the Jose 
Dolores Estrada San Jacinto Battle Order in the degree of Great 
Collar. Cristiani is in Nicaragua on an official visit. During 
the ceremony, Chamorro emphasized the ties of friendship between 
the two Central American countries. 
  [Begin Chamorro recording] On this occasion, I wish to 
reiterate the deep friendship that the Nicaraguan people have 
always expressed for our Salvadoran friends. The feeling is 
mutual. In this way, I am returning the hospitality that I 
received during my visit to El Salvador in March last year, when 
the entire Salvadoran community treated me with love, 
friendship, and understanding. These ties are strong because we 
are one and the same people who have shared the experiences of 
the same history. The two peoples are united by efforts to 
attain peace and progress in our countries. It is up to us 
Nicaraguans to testify to this friendship. To you, Mr. 
President, and the friends that accompany you, I reiterate our 
sincere feelings of friendship toward the Salvadoran people, so 
worthily represented in the past four years by a statesman who 
has wisely led his people along the path of peace and 
reconciliation. 
  The Salvadoran people suffered through a sad and cruel war, 
and they appreciate President Cristiani's great efforts toward 
pacification, disarmament, reconciliation, and democratization 
in his country. In Nicaragua, we also have had to work 
ceaselessly to consolidate the peace that we enjoy today. We 
learned a lesson that we will never forget. Dialogue and 
reconciliation should be the instrument for resolving our 
disagreements. Peace in our country becomes stronger by the day 
and overshadows all memories of the past. For that reason, our 
commitment to democracy is based on the rule of law and justice, 
which is enforced by strengthening the state of law and 
democratic institutions and by protecting human rights. [end

  [Text] Quito, 3 Mar (EFE) -- Ecuadoran Foreign Minister 
Diego Paredes today summoned U.S. Ambassador Peter Romero to 
explain the controversial remarks he made on how Ecuador should 
handle its territorial dispute with Peru. Paredes made the 
announcement at a breakfast meeting with several journalists. 
He said that after hearing Romero, the Foreign Ministry will 
adopt whatever diplomatic measures are warranted and issue a 
communique. "Ecuador is very respectful of the internal 
situations of other countries and expects the same treatment," 
he noted. 
  During an interview with the newspaper EL TELEGRAFO of 
Guayaquil, Ecuador, the U.S. ambassador had remarked that 
"Ecuadoran people are not prepared to recover their territory by 
the use of arms." "Thank God they don't want to. One must 
accept what happened and try to take advantage of trade and 
other topics to promote the unity between the two peoples and to 
progress," Romero added. 
  Regarding the Peruvian-Ecuadoran war of 1941 and the peace 
agreement signed a year later -- the Rio de Janeiro Protocol 
that Ecuador later declared "inapplicable" -- Romero said "we 
must set aside the criterion of considering fair or unfair what 
happened 50 years ago at the border between the two countries." 
We must accept what happened and go on from there, the diplomat 
stated. He said he did not know if the Ecuadoran land dispute 
is fair or unfair. 
  These statements caused quite a reaction in Ecuador, 
starting 
with the participation of the influential Association of Retired 
Generals and Admirals of the Armed Forces (Retired) which 
described Romero's words as "unheard of and inadmissible." The 
association claims that ever since he arrived in Quito several 
months ago, the ambassador "has engaged in the ungrateful task 
of advising Ecuadoreans about state modernization, aggressive 
privatizations, foreign debt payments, and giving state opinions 
about coups d'etat, appointments," and other internal affairs. 
  A bulletin issued by the association, whose voice reflects 
the opinion of the Armed Forces, says the ambassador is now 
"advising us to forget about territorial rights, which are 
inalienable and unpostponable, offending the most intimate 
patriotic feelings of Ecuadoreans." "It is surprising the 
Foreign Ministry does not defend the principle of 
nonintervention and allows a diplomat to violate his `status' 
and to express an opinion as any other politician about internal 
affairs of the country," the document states. 
  According to the retired generals and admirals, when Romero 
says that Ecuador cannot recover the territory it lost to Peru, 
"it is stating that at the beginning of the 21st century it 
remains the only means to solve international problems." 
  When the ambassador said he does not know if the claim (of 
this country) is fair or unfair, he is forgetting that Ecuador 
was sacrificed (in the 1942 peace agreement) everything because 
of a misunderstood continental solidarity," the text states. 
  The United States, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile are 
signatories of the Rio Protocol and the Association claims that, 
therefore, the U.S. ambassador should be "more cautious about 
what he says." The U.S. Embassy has not issued an official 
response to the communique by the retired military or to the 
Foreign Ministry summons.

  [Text] They are all for the Washington plan except the 
people's organizations, perhaps those very close to the 
president in exile. The political crisis settlement plan that 
arose from the Washington negotiations and was approved by a 
majority of deputies in a parliamentary session on 2 March seems 
to be gathering a maximum of support. The Haitian employer 
sector also is backing the document for which CONACOM [National 
Congress Of Democratic Movements], a party close to the 
president in exile, also gave its support to the parliament. The 
other political parties are still waiting and have refrained 
from taking a stand on what the U.S. Embassy spokesman in 
Port-au-Prince sees as a step toward the exit door in this long, 
Haitian crisis.

  [Excerpts] Following the vote by the deputies approving a 
settlement plan for the political crisis, the Senate of the 
Republic will soon be called to take a stand on the document. 
Meanwhile, questions are being posed regarding the position of 
the military whose chief, General Cedras, must go into 
retirement according to the fifth point of the plan elaborated 
in Washington by the legislators. Edner Jean tried to question 
deputies who met with the members of the Army General Staff on 
the eve of the vote on the plan to resolve the crisis: 
  [Begin Jean recording] The parliamentary delegation 
sponsoring the settlement plan for the crisis met on 1 March 
with the Army General Staff for a three-hour meeting. The 
objective was to submit the plan to the approval of the military 
through the commander in chief, a signatory to the Governors 
Island accord. 
  According to a generally reliable source, the discussions 
were very keen. The Army General Staff allegedly reproached the 
parliamentary delegation for having involved the military 
institution in a plan without its previous agreement. The 
members of the General Staff, still according to the same 
source, allegedly told the deputies clearly that they could not 
foresee the consequences of this plan. 
  To ascertain the truth of those reports, we questioned the 
members of the parliamentary delegation. Duly Brutus, one of the 
co-signers of the plan, thinks that it is too early to make 
public the nature of the contacts they had with the Army General 
Staff. Neither did he deny the reports. Duly Brutus prefers to 
speak of reservations on the part of the military. [passage 
omitted] 
  Deputy Antoine Joseph, the godfather of the plan, expresses 
reserved optimism following his meeting with the Army high 
command. The MIDH [Movement For the Establishment of Democracy 
in Haiti] legislator believes that the Army has no interest in 
blocking the solution to the crisis, as proposed by the deputies 
-- a plan that Joseph called efficient, realistic, and peaceful. 
The former president of the lower chamber, however, expressed 
the hope that Haiti's Armed Forces will not again miss the 
chance to emerge honorably from the crisis, while protecting the 
institution from a new political adventure. [passage omitted] 
  Talendier Desjardins, author of a draft resolution for the 
indictment of President Aristide, a month ago, was also part of 
the delegation that traveled to Washington, then to Army 
Headquarters. For the deputy from Tiburon, it is still early to 
say that the Army has rejected this plan. [passage omitted] 
  Since 2 March, this plan has become a resolution. Today, we 
await whatever comes next. [end recording]

  [Text] MIDH [Movement For the Establishment of Democracy in 
Haiti] supports the legislators' plan. Marc Bazin's party 
considers this document to be based on a sound analysis of the 
crisis and thinks it offers a satisfying framework for a 
negotiated and peaceful settlement. MIDH president Bazin asserts 
that the legislators' approach meets his party's objectives: 
  [Begin Bazin recording] MIDH fully supports this plan 
because 
-- as has always been known -- MIDH considers that in the 
current state of the country's sociopolitical conditions, the 
transition toward democracy can succeed only if it rests on a 
political compromise acceptable to all, based on reciprocal 
guarantees, without radical breakups, and without motives of 
revenge. It is the only formula that will bring all true 
democrats -- realists from the Left, reformers from the Right -- 
to the common task of remodeling a state in which responsible 
people would have no interest in seeing even more destruction. 
[end recording] 
  MIDH, which has always favored a compromise, invites the key 
sectors in the crisis to work toward the success of the 
legislators' plan. 
  [Begin Bazin recording] That is the reason we are inviting 
all sincere patriots, especially the two concerned parties, in 
good faith and without any holdouts. To ask the Haitian people 
today to accept additional sacrifices can no longer honestly be 
justified. It is therefore urgent simultaneously to fill the 
political vacuum and to satisfy the conditions for an immediate 
suspension of the economic sanctions. Those are, in our opinion, 
the first inevitable steps toward the normalization of public 
life and the beginning of emerging from the tunnel. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Herold Jean-Francois] </F>
  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 7 Mar (EFE) -- Port-au-Prince Mayor 
Evans Paul, who is also leader of the National Front for Change 
and Democracy (FNCD) today proposed a modification to the plan 
approved Wednesday [2 March] by the Chamber of Deputies to try 
to find a solution to the new deadlock in the Haitian crisis 
created by the [congressional] resolution. 
  Paul recommended "a commitment acceptable for President 
(Jean- Bertrand) Aristide, as well as for the other sectors 
involved in the crisis." In an interview for EFE, Paul blamed 
the international community and domestic sectors that have 
promoted the current deadlock, for the Haitian crisis. 
  "It is necessary to modify the proposal, which cannot be 
viewed as a plan yet. In order for it to become a plan, 
President Aristide and the other sectors must accept it," Paul 
said. "The international community has not adopted a firm 
position on the measures contained in the Governor's Island 
Accord and the ultimatum given to the military leaders by four 
countries (France, Canada, the United States, and Venezuela) 
which expired on 15 January," Paul stressed. 
  The FNCD leader said that some sectors support the dilatory 
tactics that have prolonged the Haitian crisis since 30 
September 1991, when a group of military leaders overthrew 
Constitutional President Aristide. Paul also mentioned the lack 
of cohesion in the democratic sector, which has favored a "fatal 
confusion and a rotten situation," adding that the same 
situation prevails in the parliament. 
  The political leader said that different groups are acting 
in 
the Haitian political scene against democracy. "While some 
people are reacting emotionally and others are trying to 
maintain the situation of crisis, we must admit that there are 
others who are acting in good faith," Paul added. 
  With regard to differences expressed within the FNCD and the 
support for the parliamentarian resolution from the Party of the 
National Congress of Democratic Movements (CONACOM), Paul said 
those are normal situations in the various fronts and political 
coalitions. As an example, he mentioned the Nicaraguan 
Sandinist National Liberation Front and the Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front in El Salvador. 
  Paul, who said he is confident some legislators will change 
their position, said that "the FNCD's position has not changed 
and is based on strengthening democracy and respecting the 
democratic rules of the game."

  [Text] The UN Security Council president, French Ambassador 
Jean-Bernard Merimee, said he acknowledged the necessity for the 
formation of a new government headed by a new prime minister. 
However, he said that would not suffice to resolve the crisis. 
It is therefore necessary to reinforce the sanctions against the 
country. Furthermore, Ambassador Merimee says that a new draft 
resolution aimed at reinforcing the embargo was referred to the 
UN Security Council and that this draft resolution, which 
includes personal sanctions against the military, will become 
effective between now and next week. 
  [Begin Merimee recording] Finally, we have a draft 
resolution 
that [words indistinct], which establishes personal sanctions 
[words indistinct]. There must be a government. But that would 
certainly not be sufficient to bring the situation to normal. 
This is why the council has decided to go into action. [end 
recording] 
  It should be noted that a draft resolution providing for 
reinforcement of the international sanctions against Haiti was 
referred to the UN Security Council on 4 March by the group 
called Friends of Haiti. This draft resolution provides for a 
total commercial embargo except for food products and medicines, 
a ban on noncommercial flights to and from Haiti, and 
restrictions on travel abroad by the Haitian military and their 
close relatives. 
  Those measures will reportedly add further to the oil and 
arms embargo that has been in effect. Except for the clauses 
relating to travel restrictions, they will reportedly be 
implemented immediately; the new sanctions will reportedly come 
into effect 15 days after the adoption of the resolution. If 
this text is accepted, it will be the first time the United 
Nations has imposed a total commercial embargo on Haiti. 
  We recall that, in an article by Robert Novak and published 
on 2 March, THE WASHINGTON POST wrote that the effects of the 
embargo on Haiti are devastating and irreversible.

  [Text] President in exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide considers 
the legislators' plan not in compliance with the Governors 
Island accord signed in New York last July, and even contrary to 
this accord in the context of reestablishing democracy in Haiti. 
This statement was made during a meeting with the UN secretary 
general. Jean-Bertrand Aristide spoke for more than an hour with 
the UN secretary general while several thousand Haitians 
demonstrated near UN headquarters in support of the president in 
exile. 
  It should be recalled that on the previous day, 4 March, the 
four countries, Friends of Haiti, had submitted to the UN 
Security Council a draft resolution reinforcing international 
sanctions against Haiti. The draft resolution provides for a 
total commercial embargo, except for food and medicine, the 
banning of non-commercial flights to or from Haiti, as well as 
some restrictions on travel by the authors of the coup d'etat 
and their relatives abroad. The UN Security Council is due to 
make a decision on this resolution within 15 days.

  [Excerpt] U.S. Ambassador to Port-au-Prince William Lacy 
Swing said he is sensitive to the concerns of President Aristide 
who has rejected the plan proposed by Haitian parliamentarians 
as a resolution to the crisis. Swing said that he is optimistic 
about the chances of finding a solution to the crisis. He 
mentioned four reasons that should favor a quick outcome to the 
crisis: the context of change of political systems in the 
hemisphere, the consensus of the four countries called Friends 
of Haiti, the availability of massive economic aid, and the 
Governors Island agreement. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The visit by (Michael Cozac), the assistant to 
President Clinton's special representative in the Haitian 
crisis, has come to an end. (Cozac) had arrived in 
Port-au-Prince over the weekend for the purpose of holding 
conversations with personalities involved in finding a solution 
to the crisis. Mr. (Cozac) termed the situation in Haiti 
encouraging. He made the Haitian military responsible for the 
reimposition of the sanctions. He explained that if the military 
respected their commitments within the scope of the Governors 
Island agreement, the sanctions would be lifted. He further said 
that the U.S. Government wants the Haitian Army to be 
professional and apolitical. 
  Furthermore, Mr. (Cozac) said that the Haitian 
parliamentarians' plan is a good and serious effort to 
disentangle the democratic process. In his opinion, the plan 
must not replace the Governors Island agreement, and the United 
States does not wish to impose a plan on President Aristide or 
to require from him actions not provided for by the 3 July 
agreement. Finally, Mr. (Cozac) gave the following warning, 
quote: The U.S. Government will not have relations with any de 
facto governments in Haiti, unquote.

  [Excerpts] The hydroelectric power station at Peligre, the 
principal center supplying the Haitian capital, including the 
West Department, has been inactive for some time and might 
remain so for a long time. Peligre is closed for repairs. That 
is all we were able to ascertain. No answer was given to what 
kind of repairs, the cost of those repairs, or the duration of 
those repairs since the general manager continues to hide behind 
a great wall of silence. He has perhaps chosen not to speak with 
the press because our calls remain unanswered. Jean Max Blanc 
tries to find some explanations in the following report: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] The problem of electricity in 
Haiti is not going to be solved by the end of the week or within 
a few days. Currently, the authorities of Electricity of Haiti 
[EDH] have closed the Peligre power station, which supplies 
power to the West Department. A high-ranking employee in the 
company told Radio Metropole that the authorities made such a 
decision in order to repair the Peligre station. However, this 
employee is not able to tell us how long those repairs will 
take, how much they will cost, or how much damage there is in 
the station. 
  Some say the damages are not inconsequential in the Peligre 
station. The management EDH will not confirm this information. 
The general manager, Axel Saint-Dic, never agreed to receive 
journalists and even refused to answer phone calls. Manager 
Saint-Dic, according to his secretary, is in meetings everyday. 
Perhaps Saint-Dic is seeking solutions to the electricity 
problem the country has been facing since 1990. 
  Although this problem is not new, it reached a new level 
some 
time ago. For instance, some neighborhoods do not have 
electricity at all, while others receive some electricity once 
or twice a week. Regardless of who comments on that problem, the 
answers are basically the same. [passage omitted] 
  The electricity problem in the country not only increases 
the 
prices of products, but also creates a change in lifestyle for 
Haitians. The problem of electricity is now closely linked to 
the problem of fuel. Some business people say those problems 
have caused the decrease in sales, and the prices of freezer 
products have increased. They explain that the greater the stock 
of products requiring refrigeration, the more fuel the 
generators need to operate. The result is that the consumers pay 
those costs while their purchase power is at a standstill. The 
other problem is that since the consumers cannot stock at home, 
they are obliged to spend more on gasoline to market everyday. 
[passage omitted] If people are more or less informed on the 
fluctuating price of gasoline, no one knows when Haitians will 
no longer have to face this electricity dilemma in the country. 
  While still waiting for the EDH general manager, Axel 
Saint-Dic, to answer questions regarding the importance and 
duration of the work to be done in Peligre, most of the 
neighborhoods in Port-au- Prince are blacked out, while others 
enjoy electricity 24 hours a day. Some residents explain that in 
addition to these problems, some people steal their 
transformers. The daily blackout encourages much negative 
behaivior, which is being reported in Port-au-Prince. [end

  [Text] The trade agreement between Costa Rica and Mexico, 
which goes into force on 1 January 1995, will constitute Costa 
Rica's first step toward joining NAFTA, which has been signed by 
Mexico, the United States, and Canada. 
  Mexico had wanted to sign an agreement with all of the 
Central American countries, but the pressure exerted by both 
President Salinas and President Calderon -- both of whom were 
eager to sign a bilateral agreement of such great significance 
for their countries -- was decisive. 
  This agreement is undoubtedly one of President Calderon's 
personal victories, and it will represent great benefits for 
Costa Rica's development, particularly because it strengthens 
our independence vis-a-vis the unionist pressure by the 
remaining Central American countries.

  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has condemned 
yesterday's terrorist act that destroyed the bridge over the San 
Juan River. De Leon Carpio said he did not want to think that 
the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] staged the 
attack, because if they did, no one could rely on their 
political willingness to achieve peace in Guatemala. 
  The president confirmed that the damage has been estimated 
at 
1 million quetzals, including the demolition of the structure, 
installation of a Bailey bridge today, and construction of a new 
bridge.

<F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Official spokespersons for the Army Information and 
Press Department [DIDE] have blamed the URNG [Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity] for a terrorist attack early 
Sunday morning on the route to the Atlantic area. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] What information do you have on 
the explosion at the bridge over the San Juan River? 
  [Unidentified DIDE spokesperson] Once more the URNG has 
attacked Guatemalan society. This time they have blown up the 
San Juan Bridge located at the 20-kilometer marker on the 
highway to the Atlantic area. 
  For the time being, the Guatemalan Army Corps of Engineers 
is 
working in the area to put a Bailey bridge in place. This 
Bailey bridge costs 2,530,562 quetzales, and repairs to the 
bridge that was blown up will cost approximately 5 million 
quetzales. This ungrateful action by the URNG will cost 
Guatemalans 7,530,652 quetzales. 
  In addition, the action involves costs in the economic, 
business, and transportation sectors, as well as the threat and 
danger posed to the Guatemalan people at the time of the 
explosion. The Guatemalan people are still running a risk while 
the bridge is being repaired. 
  [Reporter] What type of explosives were used this time? 
  [DIDE spokesperson] The information we have is that strong 
dynamite charges were used. 
  [Reporter] How long will it take the Army engineers to 
repair 
the damage? 
  [DIDE spokesperson] In this case, the URNG destroys while 
the 
Army builds. The Guatemalan Army Corps of Engineers is setting 
up the Bailey bridge at this time. Traffic will be restored at 
approximately 1700 today, but it will take another 48 hours for 
the bridge to be fully operational. 
  [Reporter] Why did the URNG blow up this bridge? 
  [DIDE spokesperson] Right now we don't know. I don't think 
that is really important. What is important is that with this 
action, the URNG is showing how much respect it has for 
Guatemalans' human rights. 
  [Reporter] What do you think of the URNG's blowing up this 
bridge in Guatemala while holding peace talks in Mexico? 
  [DIDE spokesperson] This is very contradictory. While it is 
attending negotiations and holding talks for the benefit of all 
Guatemalans, at the same time it is acting against our society. 
The truth is that it is very regrettable. Guatemala is no 
longer willing to tolerate such actions. Actually, the damage 
to our country goes beyond all estimates. 
  [Reporter] On another subject, how about the fire early this 
morning in the former military hospital? 
  [DIDE spokesman] A fire began at about 0200 at the former 
military hospital in Zone 10. The fire was controlled at 0500. 
We still do not know the origin of this fire, but it started at 
the former administrative office, which was destroyed. It was a 
very old and deteriorated building. That is why the military 
hospital was transferred to the new building at Zone 17. 
  [Reporter] Was anyone in the building at the time? 
  [DIDE spokesperson] There was no one there. 
  [Reporter] What are the damage estimates? 
  [DIDE spokesperson] The fire was early this morning, and 
personnel are currently evaluating the condition of the rest of 
the building. Reporters wanted to enter this morning, but we 
are first verifying the condition of the building before anyone 
is allowed in. 
  [Reporter] On another subject, have there been any armed 
confrontations between the Army and the guerrillas? 
  [DIDE spokesperson] I do not have any information to that 
effect at the moment, but there were no confrontations on 
Saturday or Sunday. [end recording]

  [Text] The Army Information Office has reported that 
terrorists of the self-styled Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Unity (URNG) attacked the Aczumbal patrol base in Quiche while 
several UN Human Rights delegates were boarding a light airplane. 
  The source added that the airplane, registration TG-CAC and 
piloted by Gerardo Poitevan, carried 18 delegates, including Dr. 
Sergio Viva Scheel, a UN human rights consultant. This fact was 
later corroborated by Hugo Leon Mejia del Aguila, the human 
rights office assistant in Nebaj, Quiche. 
  The visitors witnessed the attack and saw how the rebels 
fired indiscriminately without regard for the fact that 
civilians were present in a flagrant violation of human rights, 
the Army report states. 
  The Guatemalan Army reported that this attack shows once 
again the guerrillas' lack of respect for the sacred right to 
life. After the rebel attack, the visiting delegations traveled 
without further incidents. The delegates did say they would 
report the event at the international level because the URNG's 
criminal action exposed its lack of political willingness to 
promote peace, the report concludes.

<F P=106> [Speech given by FSLN Commander Tomas Borge at FSLN assembly </F>
in District IV, Managua] 
<H5>  [8 Feb p 7] </H5>
  [Text] In any political party--and the Sandinist National 
Liberation Front [FSLN] is no exception--there are agreements 
and disagreements. I think it is necessary to determine where we 
are in agreement and where we are in disagreement. 
  It is said that some want reform and others do not, and yet, 
when it comes time to talk about reform, everyone is in 
agreement. No one in the Sandinist Front disagrees with the 
internal reform of the Sandinist Front; if anyone does, let them 
say so, because no one has said anything about it so far. 
  Who does not think there should be currents of opinion in 
the 
Sandinist Front? What happened in the true socialist countries? 
They forced party members to think in unison. You shouted in the 
town plaza, "National Directorate, give us your orders!" In 
other words, you had the same opinions as the National 
Directorate. Now you are beginning to doubt, to question, to 
agree; and this thing called doubt, questioning, and agreement 
is democracy, the real possibility for each of us to express our 
own views. 
  The majority opinion should prevail, and that is what is 
called democracy. Therefore, we all agree on the need for 
political currents; that is another area of agreement. There is 
a framework for defining terms, and reference was made to it 
here. That framework is the program. The members of a party--and 
we are no exception--are members of the party to the extent that 
they agree on a program. 
<H5>  Political Program </H5>
  What is our program? A framework of interpretations that has 
boundaries. We cannot go beyond the boundary if we want to be 
members of a party. Nevertheless, there are different shades of 
meaning and criteria in different subheadings that can only be 
reconciled by means of a political program. 
  A draft revision of the program is now being discussed. It 
must be discussed, and once we approve it, it will be our guide. 
Those who agree with that program may be members of the 
Sandinist Front; those who do not, may not. This discussion 
should not be based on intrigue, invective, or even praise, but 
rather on political differences. 
  What is contributing to these differences of opinion? People 
are promoting candidacies for elections to be held in the year 
19-whatever, and the promotion of candidacies is causing 
individual alienation. 
  Promoting candidacies at this juncture may be damaging, and 
in fact it has been. In large measure, the consequences of this 
individual alienation are reflected in what has happened in the 
last few days. This should be another point we can agree on. 
  Candidacies for the National Directorate or the Sandinist 
Assembly should be promoted, not those for the presidency of 
Nicaragua or for deputy seats. Now, when we discuss who should 
be the candidate and how they should run, "we must think it over 
carefully." We are not going to nominate a candidate who will 
lose, but a candidate who will win. We must select the candidate 
who can assure us of victory at the time, but it must also be a 
candidate who shows respect for the revolutionary principles for 
which so much blood has been shed. 
  Now, are there political contradictions within the Sandinist 
Front? Yes, there are. There always have been. They used to be 
resolved in the National Directorate. Sometimes we were not 
satisfied. There was a certain balance of power that favored 
some and hurt others; that was true, but differences were 
resolved within the National Directorate. 
  If there are personal differences, we can resolve them 
through political discussion, and it will not be difficult to 
resolve personal differences. Are there ideological differences? 
Yes, there are. Is it legitimate or not that there are 
ideological differences? What is the framework of ideological 
differences within the Sandinist Front, and what are its 
parameters? Our ideological differences with the liberals, for 
example, are extremely clear. It is undoubtedly more difficult 
to delineate ideological differences within a party that claims 
to be revolutionary. 
  There are revolutionary ideas and, apparently, ideas 
approximating social democracy. Sometimes, however, we succumb 
to subjective assessments and we call some people dogmatic and 
others social democratic. But where there is smoke, there is 
fire, and in this ideological reign there is smoke. 
  If there are, perchance, social democratic tendencies in the 
Sandinist Front, we might ask, "What is social democracy?" 
Social democracy split off from revolutionary socialism in the 
last century, from the communist and socialist parties of the 
time. The social democrats said these parties were obsolete. 
They said we needed a profound reform, and we must also abandon 
political violence. We needed to give absolute priority to 
parliamentary debate. 
  This contradiction between social democracy and revolution 
in 
the new conditions in the world leads us to ask, "Is social 
democracy moving toward revolutionary positions, or is social 
democracy moving toward liberalism?" Are there areas of 
agreement and disagreement between social democracy and 
revolution? Are there areas of agreement and disagreement 
between social democracy and liberalism? Where does social 
democracy fit on the ideological dial, on the left or on the 
right? 
<H5>  [9 Feb p 11] </H5>
  [Text] It appears that there are center-left social 
democrats and center-right social democrats. Social democrats 
have a fascination with the semantics of the center; either they 
are center-left or center-right. If they are not left or right, 
we must conclude that they are in the center. 
  So is the Sandinist Front social democratic or not? I would 
say that the Sandinist Front is not social democratic; the 
Sandinist Front is the Sandinist National Liberation Front 
[FSLN], with its own revolutionary ideas. But what happened, 
aside from stating that we are friends of social democrats, they 
have shown us solidarity and we are grateful to each and every 
party and to the Social Democratic International? 
  I think that although we are friends, we are not social 
democrats. We have not been until now. But I say, what mistake 
did we make? We asked to join as full-fledged members of the 
Socialist International. The Socialist International is the 
organization that brings together all social democrats. Our rank 
and file did not like the idea. Nevertheless, we insisted on 
becoming full-fledged members of social democracy. In the end, 
and wisely, I think, the social democrats realized that we were 
not social democrats and did not accept our application for full 
membership; they left us as observers. 
  They were wiser than we were. But what were the consequences 
of that? It led to confusion, and some sectors of the Sandinist 
Front felt encouraged to move closer ideologically to social 
democracy. Since 1979 this faction has always existed, and it 
never has had an opportunity to express itself. 
  This situation has resulted, in my opinion, in a controversy 
that may lead us to make subjective judgments. Historically, 
social democracy was considered to be in the center. Social 
democracy has historically advocated moderation--they have 
called themselves moderates--and they have historically 
advocated the reform of dogmatic parties. They have called 
themselves reformers, regardless of the fact that we have all 
been in favor of reform in this party. Perhaps that is why they 
have claimed that label exclusively for themselves. Those who 
feel that they are reformers here do not think that others are. 
  This situation must be discussed; we must ask our comrades 
to 
define their positions, because if they are social democrats or 
sympathize with social democracy, we are not going to expel 
them; they have a right to have their own ideas, just as others 
have the right to have other ideas. 
<H5>  Reform and Controversy </H5>
  The prevailing ideas will be those of the Sandinist National 
Liberation Front. Within the context of these possible 
ideological differences, serious errors were made. The memory of 
fallen comrades was insulted, comrades who had always been 
respected in the ranks of the Sandinist Front. I am referring to 
Rogelio Ramirez, whom we knew personally, a comrade who shone 
with his own light, who served the Sandinist Front years before 
the social democrats became Sandinists. We must respect him, 
just as we must respect all comrades, and not just those who are 
dead but also those who are alive, but especially those who are 
dead. 
  Sometimes the enemy makes up stories that we own businesses, 
motels, and this and that, and afterward everyone repeats the 
enemy's stories as if they were true, when they are made up to 
discredit the leaders of the revolution so that they will lose 
their authority. And if they lose their authority, the Sandinist 
Front deteriorates. 
  It is legitimate, therefore, to have differences of opinion 
and to discuss them. We should not be afraid of differences. I 
am more afraid of homogeneity in opinions, because only sheep 
think the same way, perhaps because they do not think. And I was 
telling some comrades on the directorate, and I tell everyone, 
"What happens if I want to be the secretary general of the 
Sandinist Front and the congress says no? Will I go off and form 
another party?" 
  What happens if I want to run for president of Nicaragua and 
the congress says no, and nominates someone else? Will I go off 
and form another party? Do I have the right to divide the 
Sandinist Front because my individual aspirations were not 
satisfied? 
  And what is true for me is true for everyone. What do we 
want? To be deputies? To be political secretaries? To be 
secretary general, president of Nicaragua, or members of the 
FSLN? We cannot have the slightest doubt: We are members of the 
Sandinist National Liberation Front. 
  No one can take that away from me, no sir, because we may 
not 
have the honor of being president--the person who is nominated 
for the presidency will have that honor--but the greatest honor 
for us is to be members of the Sandinist Front. And those who 
would leave the Sandinist Front because they are not chosen to 
run for the presidency or a high-ranking office, secretary 
general or deputy, let them leave. But they are turning their 
backs on the greatest honor we have as Nicaraguan 
revolutionaries: being members of the Sandinist National 
Liberation Front.

<F P=106> [Interview with 3-80 Northern Front leader Jose Alberto </F>
Talavera, a.k.a. "El Chacal," by unidentified Radio Corporacion 
reporters; in (Caulatu), northern Jinotega; date not given; 
monitored in progress -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Talavera] ...That is part of the government's not 
honoring its word, and that is why it is now confronting so many 
problems, like the demands being made by the peasants in 
Managua. That is why we do not trust the government to keep its 
word, and why we feel tomorrow, the government might decide not 
to honor its commitments. You could say we are on the alert. We 
are keeping a watchful eye on the government to see if it will 
follow through with its promises. As I said before, in previous 
years the government has not kept a significant number of 
agreements with us. I could even say it has not honored even a 
small part of the agreements that were very important to the 
Nicaraguan Resistance [RN] movement at the time when it was 
armed. The RN movement continues to be an organization with a 
very ample social base, which, by the way, is still quite 
significant. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What about the call (Jimmy Leo), 
president of the RN High Council, made to the 3-80 Northern 
Front through several Managua radio stations; a call for an end 
to the negotiations agenda with the government, while problems 
such as land distribution, ownership titles, and hunger strikes 
are still unsolved? 
  [Talavera] With respect to statements made by the RN High 
Council president or vice president, we completely support them 
as part of the resistance. We also feel a certain degree of 
solidarity with all the commando units that support the peasants 
who are participating in a hunger strike. A very just cause is 
what has forced them to adopt this hunger strike decision 
because the government has not honored its obligations. We have 
a responsibility toward them, and we want to say that from the 
moment they decided to go on a hunger strike, we, in turn, 
decided to pressure the government to keep its word. 
  [Reporter] Will that in any way interfere with negotiations 
already carried out with respect to an initial demobilization? 
  [Talavera] Since we consider ourselves responsible people, 
there might not be a need to interrupt negotiations, but if we 
have opportunities, like tomorrow at 1000 hours, when we are 
scheduled to meet face to face with government representatives, 
we will call attention to the plight of those Managua peasants. 
  [Reporter] What is your opinion of the decision by "El 
Charro" and "Northiel" not to demobilize? 
  [Talavera] We have received information indicating that 
there has been some contact between mediating organizations, 
such as Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo's commission, the 
CIAV-OAS [International Commission of Support and 
Verification-OAS], and an exchange of letters. I believe it 
would be premature to talk about whether or not they will decide 
to demobilize. If I decided to comment on this issue, I would 
most likely be speculating. They are also fighting, however, 
for the same things we are, and we expect there will be a 
satisfactory solution to the problems. In all reality, 
Nicaragua's problems have not been solved, and the government 
has complicated things even more by not honoring its obligations. 
  [Unidentified reporter] This morning's BARRICADA newspaper 
... 
  [Talavera, interrupting] What's that? 
  [Reporter] This morning's BARRICADA newspaper reported that 
the 3-80 Northern Front had sold its Redeye missiles to drug 
traffickers. The report also pointed out that the missiles had 
been sold for $25,000 each. What can you say about this? 
  [Talavera] All I can say about the alleged sale of Redeye 
missiles by the 3-80 Northern Front is that the person who wrote 
the report is very irresponsible. The author reveals 
information in a very malicious manner and attempts to 
manipulate Nicaraguan public opinion and portray us as worthless 
people. Maybe he is worthless and that is why he wrote that 
report. All I can say is we have never associated with drug 
traffickers or become involved in any other type of corruption. 
  [Reporter] You still have the missiles under your control? 
  [Talavera] Of course. We still have a significant amount of 
weapons under our control. The demobilization process involves 
at least 100 or more men ... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] Do you plan to turn over the Redeye 
missiles once the demobilization process is over? 
  [Talavera] So far, we are in a negotiation phase. We have 
initiated negotiations the same way as we have initiated 
negotiations with respect to demobilization. Tomorrow we have 
another meeting scheduled with the government. It follows a 
process. 
  [Reporter] Jose Angel, what words do you people use to talk 
to the government about the RN's general problem, whether it is 
poverty, desertion, etc.? According to the 3-80 Northern Front, 
how many men participate in RN activities? 
  [Talavera] Nearly 30,000 active military men are involved in 
RN activities. Also, hundreds of thousands are involved in the 
social problem. Our biggest problem is that peasants, who make 
up the RN's rank and file, are one of the most seriously ignored 
sectors. 
  [Reporter] In addition to the information reporter Alvaro 
Cruz read to you, we have also heard that you have been getting 
support from Honduras. Some newspapers have hinted that the RN 
has received aid from Honduran military men. What can you say 
about this? 
  [Talavera] Those reports are groundless. Their only grounds 
is speculation. We have never been supported by any government. 
Our struggle has been 100 percent nationalist and supported by 
the Nicaraguan people. 
  [Reporter] Commander Chacal, will some of the demobilized RN 
commanders participate in the training classes to be held at the 
Walter Mendoza police academy? 
  [Talavera] Only line officers from the first demobilization 
will attend the course at the Managua Police Academy. The rest 
of the officers, who will work in the country's northern 
municipalities, have yet to participate in the course. 
  [Reporter] Commander Chacal, when will the RN's main body be 
incorporated into the RN Party? 
  [Talavera] RN is united as an organization. We are keenly 
interested in consolidating a party that can represent and be 
the political arm of the peasants, workers, and students. We 
must say the organization has been growing steadily. We want to 
be incorporated into the RN party as soon as possible. I believe 
only details remain to be worked out and that all RN sectors 
want to form a single party, a political arm to coalesce all of 
the RN members as well as the rank and file. 
  [Reporter] Has the 3-80 Northern Front been assigned any 
responsibility in the RN High Council? I understand that you 
have talked to the High Council. 
  [Talavera] We have not met with the RN High Council, but we 
want to belong to it so we can be more active and be heard. As 
soon as we lay down our arms, our struggle becomes a civic one. 
  [Reporter] Commander Chacal, how do you explain the RN 
party's failure in the Atlantic Coast elections, where the RN 
did not win a single seat? 
  [Talavera] I do not know what really happened at the 
Atlantic 
Coast elections because we were busy with other problems. We 
were confronting a military offensive. I do not think the RN's 
failure to win even one seat represents much. I think, however, 
that this is due to a scarcity of available resources and a lack 
of publicity. We do enjoy broad support in the Atlantic Coast. 
Of this I am sure. 
  [Reporter] Commander, what are your comments on criticism 
from exiled Nicaraguans in Miami who say that the fact that the 
3-80 Northern Front has agreed to demobilize is treason to the 
RN. 
  [Talavera] The people who have expressed that opinion are 
totally removed from the real situation here in Nicaragua. I 
have belonged to the RN for many years. I was brought up in 
this. I have never felt like I betrayed the RN. Proof of that 
is the fact that I have the support of all the peasants in 
northern Nicaragua and of the leaders who are in command. We do 
not feel we have turned our backs on these peasants. On the 
contrary, I would say this is being looked at from another point 
of view. There are some people who like to talk, and those who 
talk the most are the ones who do the least. That is the 
situation. The people who made those comments had no bases for 
doing so. The reality here is totally different. It is not the 
same to live in Miami and to see war on television as to face 
the enemy not knowing where to obtain resources, secure 
logistics, ammunition, and other type of war materiel. What 
does one do with the wounded, the dead, and the grieving? What 
will be done with the war disabled? What will be done about a 
number of consequences brought on by war? 
  I regard the type of information given by certain gentlemen 
in Miami as totally irresponsible. We have very solid social 
foundations, we have good friends, but there are those who 
always like to find fault. There are some bad Nicaraguans who 
are always on the lookout. They are always trying to criticize, 
but their criticism is totally destructive. The reality here 
in Nicaragua is totally different. 
  [Reporter] The matter of Northiel [Wilfredo Gutierrez or 
Wilfredo Chavarria], Charro, and other members of the 3-80 
Northern Front is still pending. What is the position of these 
cells or groups led by specific commanders regarding the 
demobilization plans or negotiations with the government? 
  [Talavera] In the case of Commanders [name indistinct], 
Charro, and Northiel, I think the negotiations will have to be 
held directly with them. The 3-80 Northern Front is negotiating 
independently. We believe that the commanders who lead those 
troops will negotiate directly with the government. 
  [Reporter] Commander Chacal, could you give us the names of 
those who make up the 3-80 Northern Front general staff? 
  [Talavera] There is a board of commanders. Commander Piloto, 
Commander Carlos, Commander Chacalin [Salvador Talavera 
"Esteban"], Commander Gringo, Commander Musun, and Commander 
Martin are some of them. There are several other commanders 
whom I do not....[pauses] There is Commander Magnum. 
  [Reporter] Tell me something, are the troops or groups led 
by 
Northiel or Carlos part of the 3-80 Northern Front? 
  [Talavera] We consider them brothers as we are struggling 
for 
the same cause, but the 3-80 Northern Front is totally 
independent from those commanders. 
  [Reporter] Commander Chacal, excuse me if I insist, but do 
you really have a great deal of faith that the government will 
meet the agreements signed? 
  [Talavera] We have hope, as I said before, and we also have 
faith. The fact of the matter is that we have our 
apprehensions. On previous occasions the government has not met 
its commitments, but we hope that this time they will not repeat 
the same actions or that they will not fall into the vicious 
circle of making promises that they don't keep. 
  [Reporter] Commander Chacal, what can you tell us about the 
work in the labor unions carried out by the RN Superior Council 
in Managua. 
  [Talavera] It has been very well done. Any organization that 
seeks to unite the RN has my blessing. I congratulate the 
commanders who have shown interest in the RN going down one road 
under one leadership. I congratulate the general command and 
the supporters who participated. Many of them in the party and 
in the RN Supreme Council are actively participating to unite 
the entire RN organization. 
  [Reporter] It would be interesting to know the scope of the 
demobilization plan, because the government always claims it 
lacks the funds needed to cover demobilization expenses. How 
much money will be required to implement the plan? 
  [Talavera] That is true. The government always claims it 
lacks funds for this purpose, although it has funds for other 
activities. In reality, the needs and demands of peasants in 
this area are very high. Our goals, however, are beyond the 
government's promises and agreements. We have created 
commissions to request international aid to lessen the 
government's burden and to help peasants join the nation's 
social and productive life. 
  [Reporter] Does that mean the government will have to resort 
to credits from banks and to money that is not readily available 
or that is obtained at a high cost? If you request 
international aid, what will be the state's contribution? 
  [Talavera] We are not talking about specific amounts yet. 
We do know that there are many social demands, that the 
peasants need assistance and financial aid. The government has 
many responsibilities toward peasants that it has not accepted. 
We cannot give exact amounts. We are not saying the government 
should give them handouts but that they should reincorporate 
them into society and find ways to help peasants in the northern 
region who have been totally neglected in the past years. 
  [Reporter] What will happen if the government does not 
comply? 
  [Talavera] We are always ready to continue our struggle. We 
will continue our efforts and present our demands. We will 
resort to all civic and peaceful means to demand full compliance 
with the agreements. Based on our experience, I know there will 
always be problems, but we do hope we will not have to pressure 
the government to ensure its total compliance. The negotiations 
have just begun. It is a process, and we hope this time the 
government will act in good faith. 
  [Reporter] Commander Chacal, what was the purpose of 
Esteban's visit to Managua this weekend? 
  [Talavera] Esteban visited Managua for several reasons. 
First he had to go to the police academy to receive a group of 
demobilized 3-80 Northern Front members who are participating in 
an intensive course before going to the municipalities where 
they will be stationed. He also had to coordinate future 
meetings with the central government, which I believe will be 
headed by Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta. Those were the 
main reasons for his visit, to receive the group of former 
combatants in Managua and to create a direct channel between the 
Government Ministry and the 3-80 Northern Front to avoid future 
obstacles that could delay the negotiation process. 
  [Reporter] There is an interesting factor. The second chief 
of staff, who I believe is Javier Carrion, has held talks with 
the 3-80 Northern Front High Command. Do you feel you can trust 
this top EPS [Sandinist People's Army] officer? We have heard 
peasants say that there is still espionage and persecution. Do 
you think you can trust him as member of the Army since he was 
the one who talked to you? 
  [Talavera] We must accept certain things. We must talk with 
the people who have power in Nicaragua. Those who have the 
weapons are the ones who run the country. The Army has the 
weapons and is involved in the struggle. The government sent 
its representatives, and Colonel Carrion was one of them. We 
participated in direct talks at the negotiating table. 
  We must admit, however, that we have our misgivings. 
Security was one of the key points discussed at the meeting. 
We know full well that our lives are in serious danger once we 
demobilize. Therefore, one of the most critical topics we 
discussed at the meeting, which was suspended on several 
occasions, was security. We are afraid that once we demobilize 
we could face direct persecution or be killed. The hundreds of 
commanders who have been killed are proof of that. We must act 
maturely in these negotiations to prevent persecution or attacks 
in the future. We had to make this clear. One of the 
agreements reached to give security to our troops was their 
admission into the National Police. 
  [Reporter] What does that agreement entail? To what extent 
would the police serve as a guarantee for the security of the 
RN's 3-80 Northern Front? 
  [Talavera] Most of those demobilized in the northern area 
are 
former RN members. All 3-80 Northern Front fighters live in 
this area and were born and raised here. After speaking to 
them, they confirm that they intend to continue living here. 
Therefore, this would help them a great deal, and they would 
feel more confident as it would remove the tensions thanks to 
the constant contact with their own people and organizations in 
their own backyard. It is only logical. That does not mean we 
do not feel at ease with Nicaraguans from other parts of the 
country. It is really a reflection of the military problem, the 
military conflict, which since last decade has been bloodier in 
this area than anywhere else.

  [Text] Panama City, 7 Mar (DPA) -- Panamanian opposition 
[presidential] candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares charged today 
that U.S. "ultraconservative" members "entrenched" in the U.S. 
services in this country are attempting, through a plan, to 
prevent him from winning the upcoming 8 May general elections. 
  Ernesto Perez Balladares, Democratic Revolutionary Party 
[PRD] leader, told a group of newsmen that the plan goes from 
slander to injury to possible murder. The PRD and former 
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega were overthrown from power by 
the U.S. invasion on 20 December. 
  Perez Balladares noted that U.S. officials appointed during 
the administration of former U.S. President George Bush, 
apparently are not resigned to the PRD returning to power. He 
added that the U.S. plan has been coordinated with supporters of 
the conservative and neoliberal candidate, former Comptroller 
Ruben Dario Carles, who supported the U.S. military action 
against Panama. 
  Ernesto Perez Balladares currently leads by a significant 
margin in all presidential polls published, followed by former 
Comptroller Carles. The opposition candidate said he has 
strengthened his personal security and will be very careful in 
his political tours because "I don't want to die at the age of 
47," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Ovidio Bellando] </F>
  [Text] Although Margaret Thatcher's upcoming visit to Chile 
was not on the agenda of two-day talks in Santiago between 
Argentine Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella and his 
Chilean counterpart, Rodrigo Jesus Diaz Albonico, the 
quasi-official treatment that Thatcher will receive on her way 
to the Malvinas Islands reportedly aroused Argentine curiosity. 
  Invited by the Industrial Development Association (Sofofa) 
and the Center for Political Studies, Thatcher will be in Chile 
between 20 and 23 March. 
  Thatcher will hold a 45-minute news conference on her 
administration's economic performance. A (projected) audience 
of 500 people will contribute with sumptuous fees. 
  Thatcher, her husband, and a small entourage will first 
visit 
Brazil, where she will also hold a paid lecture, which seems 
already to be regular practice for successful former heads of 
government. 
  Petrella's visit, which will conclude today, had been 
prepared before the iron lady's visit to Chile was disclosed. 
Thatcher will visit Chile shortly after President Frei's 
inauguration on 11 March. 
  Some Argentine circles believe this event represents the 
Chilean Christian Democratic Party's leaning toward the British 
Conservative Party's iron hand. The British Conservative Party 
supports the islanders' unyielding position at a time when our 
diplomacy is conducting various actions concerning the 
century-old Malvinas Islands issue. 
  Although this does not seem to be entirely the case, there 
is 
a real bias: The official facilities for Thatcher's visit to 
the Malvinas Islands. Nevertheless, based on pragmatism, the 
Foreign Ministry is minimizing her visit. 
  Experts say: "In the old days, the political willingness of 
government officials guided economic cooperation. Nowadays it 
is the other way around." 
  Trade with Chile was over $1 billion in 1993 (with a small 
surplus for Chile), not counting the $200 to $400 million 
contributed by tourism. After Japan and the EEC, Argentina is 
Chile's number three partner. Chile has invested $1 billion in 
Argentina. Why, then, these annoyed attitudes? 
  We don't know if Petrella, at his level and with 
interlocutors who are ending their tenure, managed to make his 
interlocutors understand "the Argentine surprise." 
  What Argentine diplomatic circles do actually trust in is 
the 
equilibrium that Carlos Figueroa, Frei's foreign minister, has 
demonstrated during his outstanding performance as Chilean 
ambassador to Argentina; and in Diaz Albonico, who, along with 
current Interior Minister Enrique Krauss and Edmundo Vargas, the 
current Chilean ambassador to Argentina, are included on a list 
of three candidates to occupy the embassy on Tagle Street. 
  Distrustful people associate Thatcher's visit to Chile and 
the Malvinas Islands with the possibility of counteracting the 
participation of four Malvinas Islands personalities, including 
the tourism director, in a conference sponsored by CARI 
[Argentine Council for International Relations] in Mendoza to 
review an improvement of the situation.

<F P=106> [Report by LA NACION special correspondent Eduardo De Simone </F>
from Madrid] 
  [Text] The Argentine Administration hopes that Brazil's 
recent economic plan will help shorten the deadlines for 
integration within the framework of the Common Market of the 
South [Mercosur]. Many people believe that Brazil's new 
economic plan will help reduce the economic differences between 
that country and Argentina. 
  The economic plan which Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso launched had been "continuously discussed" with 
the Argentine economic team due to the excellent relations 
between the two administrations. 
  Government officials and businessmen who are attending the 
Seminar on Business Opportunities in Argentina and the Mercosur 
which will end today in Madrid informally evaluated the 
repercussions of Brazil's new economic plan. 
  Carlos Sanchez, Argentine Economy Ministry secretary for 
investments and foreign trade, stated that the implementation of 
measures which will put an end to the indexing of Brazilian 
economy and will reduce public deficit is very positive. 
  Sanchez added that concrete effects of these measures will 
be 
perceived starting next year and Argentina will benefit from 
them. 
  The Argentine economic team believes that the measures 
Cardoso has proposed will increase the value of Brazilian 
currency and Argentina will benefit from the exchange rate. It 
is well-known that Argentina has a large deficit in its trade 
with Brazil. 
  Carlos Leone, chairman of the Argentine Steel Comany Inc. 
said: "Brazil's program is positive because the exchange rate 
will be more favorable to Argentina. Leone emphasized that 
Brazil's decision to curb its fiscal deficit is praiseworthy. 
  Angel Perversi, vice chairman of the Bunge and Born Company 
stated: "This plan is an improvement over what they now have," 
but he chose to be cautious. "Let us wait for results," he 
said. In any case, Perversi's advice was that Brazil's changes 
should not lull us to sleep. "We should focus on retrofitting 
and the changes we can make ourselves," he told LA NACION. 
  Argentine Industrial Union President Jorge Blanco Villegas 
stated: "Trade with Brazil will improve as soon as Brazil 
improves." He added: "We hope that Brazil will succeed, although 
it is a very complex plan." Villegas emphasized that "there 
have been many other programs, all of which have failed." 
  The truth is that most businessmen who came to Madrid are 
still waiting for a change in the economic situation of the main 
Mercosur partner. Further negotiations for the establishment of 
a common market are fraught with uncertainties which could be 
cleared gradually if the new plan works out. 
  The somewhat lukewarm enthusiasm of government officials and 
businessmen moved President Carlos Menem to forecast: "Mercosur 
will be beneficial to all American countries, including the 
United States." 
  Everyone is wholeheartedly praying that this is not just 
another episode in the comings and goings of regional 
integration.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcia Carmo from Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] Although he has not joined any political party since 
he left the PRN [National Reconstruction Party] in 1992, 
President Itamar Franco has made up his mind to participate in 
this year's elections. He has already told some of his friends 
that, being a politician, he does not plan to remain aloof from 
the race. According to the president "this is part of the 
presidential system and democracy." 
  On the last day of Carnival, Franco said that "should" 
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso become a candidate, 
he, Franco, would support him. Although his statements to this 
effect have prompted negative reactions, the president insists 
that the finance minister is the ideal candidate. He does 
emphasize, however, that he will give Cardoso his explicit 
support only after the latter makes up his mind to run for 
president. People who are close to the president have said that 
Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho could be the 
president's second choice. 
  Franco, who has been in politics for more than 30 years and 
is one of the founders of the MDB [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement], is also planning to influence the elections in Minas 
Gerais State. To this end he has been holding frequent talks 
with Governor Helio Garcia. An old local politician who is 
close to both the president and the governor has said: "Minas 
Gerais will set an example of unity." 
  Last week, Deputy Israel Pinheiro Filho (PRS) [Social Reform 
Party] -- who is also from Minas Gerais -- was running around 
Congress pushing yet another proposal: to get dissatisfied 
members of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and 
the PFL [Liberal Front Party] to join forces with the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party] to support one candidate on 
whom they could all agree. He believes that this group could 
establish a new party which the president could join. This, 
however, is not in Franco's plans. He believes that being 
nonpartisan he is free to support any candidate he wants. 
  Time and again Cardoso's name crops up as Planalto Palace's 
ideal candidate. The reason is simple enough: Even those who, 
until recently, looked upon his good standing with the president 
with rabid envy, now consider him a magician. The main cause 
for the mixed feeling of awe and admiration is the fact that the 
people do not hold the minister directly responsible for the 
high inflation. 
  One of Franco's friends wondered: "How can a man under whose 
management inflation is as high as it is now walk the streets of 
Rio de Janeiro and be cheered?" He added: "This means that 
whether he wants it or not, he is a prime candidate. Therefore, 
why shouldn't he have the president's support?" 
  Six months ago Franco did not display the enthusiasm and 
willingness to participate in the elections that he now has. He 
was dispirited, overwhelmed by too many problems, and counting 
the days left before he could step down. Now, as he has said 
himself, he has returned to Brasilia "reinvigorated" after the 
Carnival celebrations. 
  After a survey of his administration which will be released 
in the course of an advertising campaign called "The 
Administration Puts the House in Order," Franco has been in a 
good mood, and is determined to stand up more for his 
administration, be it during trips to inaugurate projects or at 
Government House. According to high-ranking government 
officials, this could give Franco the credentials he needs to 
influence his own succession.

  [Text] Fortaleza--Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes (PSDB) 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party] has said he is not a 
candidate for president of Brazil and would not accept the 
invitation if nominated. Gomes is willing to record his 
statement at a notary's office. At a meeting with Sao Paulo 
Senator Mario Covas, PSDB President Tasso Jereissati, and 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Gomes said his name is not 
available. "There are people better qualified than I in the PSDB 
hierarchy. I have already served four [as published] interrupted 
terms of office--two as deputy and one as mayor of Fortaleza," 
he said. 
  Ciro said his youth is another reason he would not agree to 
run: "I am distressingly similar to Collor, but I'm not a 
thief," and announced his plan to pursue graduate studies at 
Harvard, in the United States. In March, he will find out 
whether his application for a grant to study at the Institute 
for International Affairs has been approved. He would spend two 
years there writing a thesis on "Political Aspects of Inflation 
in Brazil."

<F P=106> [Interview with Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Henrique </F>
Cardoso by Cristiano Romero on 27 February -- place not given] 
  [Text] [Romero] Yesterday Deputy Paulo Paim said that he 
heard you say that those businessmen who want to convert their 
prices into URV [Real Value Unit] will have to discuss this with 
the Finance Ministry. 
  [Cardoso] Prices will not be converted into URV. The reason 
is that if prices are converted into URV the initial advantage I 
am granting salary earners will disappear because prices will 
also be subject to a unit that may increase on a daily basis. 
It is worse because salaries are corrected on a monthly basis 
while prices vary on a daily basis. 
  [Romero] If the businessmen choose to convert their prices 
into URV, will they be able to do so? 
  [Cardoso] No. The prices can only be set in real cruzeiros. 
Of course, they can say how many URV's the product is worth, but 
then the URV has to be a fixed unit. An example: It is worth 
10 URV's. They could say what 10 URV's are worth every day. The 
URV would have to be fixed but we are not encouraging the 
conversion of the URV into a real cruzeiro because that is going 
to happen later on when we implement the real. 
  [Romero] The businessmens' price lists are dollarized. 
Suppose they decide to adopt the URV, will they able to do so 
freely or will they have to go to the Finance Ministry 
beforehand to negotiate the conversion value? 
  [Cardoso] Nobody will have to go to the Finance Ministry. 
Because they will, among each other, among parties, adopt the 
dollar or whatever they want as they do now. What they cannot 
do is to exhibit the price only in URV's. 
  [Romero] What about speculative increases? 
  [Cardoso] Look here, speculative increases will make no 
sense from now on because speculating automatically causes 
salaries to increase. 
  [Romero] Will there be any means to fight speculation? 
  [Cardoso] There is no need due to the method we will use. 
We are fully protecting salaries. From now on there will be no 
more discussions. I see so many worried labor union leaders but 
from now on they will have to worry about something else because 
the argument, which has been valid up to now, about "the 
government having to adjust, about the peak, the average," will 
disappear with this. From now on salaries will adjust 
automatically. 
  [Moreno] How is the government going to control price 
abuses? 
  [Cardoso] You will see what mechanism we use when the 
problem surfaces but in a competitive market the market itself 
takes care of this problem. The problem is the public 
monopolies, the existing monopolies, the oligopolies, and for 
these we have adequate tools. 
  [Romero] How was the minimum salary value established? It 
seems that during yesterday's meeting, the president himself 
requested an effort to improve the minimum salary value? 
  [Cardoso] Nothing of the sort. There was no specific 
discussion on the subject. The minimum salary issue does not 
fall directly under the Finance Ministry, it concerns the Social 
Security Ministry. Brazilian laws tie one thing to another. 
Therefore, every time the minimum salary increases a bit it 
causes a serious problem for the Social Security Ministry. I 
believe we must struggle very hard now and during the 
constitutional revision to break these ties and give the 
pensioners another type of guarantee. 
  [Romero] Will the minimum salary remain at $64 at the 
commercial exchange rate? 
  [Cardoso] I do not know. I do not know what the exchange 
rate will be on the day they are fixed. We have not finished 
discussing this issue. I only want to point out that the 
Finance Ministry is not causing any difficulties. The 
difficulties stem from that real impasse. 
  [Romero] What about the disagreements between the Labor and 
Finance Ministries? 
  [Cardoso] There are no disagreements between these 
ministries. Yesterday the Labor Ministry experts produced a list 
but it was wrong. I will explain this once again because it is 
very simple. What we are telling the country -- and we are going 
to stress it tomorrow -- is: look, prices are increasing, 
therefore, we must protect salary earners. What is the best 
guarantee you can give salary earners? Transform their salaries 
into something that varies as the cost of living varies. That 
is the URV. From now on, once the URV has been approved, nobody 
needs to worry about the adjustment any more because it will be 
automatic. 
  [Romero] Yesterday experts left the Finance Ministry 
commenting that February inflation would be absorbed? 
  [Cardoso] Look, I do not know because I am not an expert on 
the subject. I do not know what that means. I think I can 
guarantee what will happen from 1 March on. What happened 
before then is something that must be discussed by the labor 
unions, businessmen, and the business chambers. The government 
is more than willing to solve the problem but it is not 
something that can be solved by law. We must say that, from now 
on, we have changed the rules. We have changed the rules to 
benefit the workers. People must understand this. There is no 
point in talking about the past to forecast the future, which is 
going to be different. 
  [Romero] Will some job categories lose money? 
  [Cardoso] If any category has a small loss, an adjustment 
can 
be made and this varies from one category to another. There can 
be losses in the first month, only in March, but there will be 
gains in the following months. But how can the adjustments be 
made? Through business organizations, labor courts. The 
government favors an adjustment if there are losses in some 
categories. Others will have gains. What will happen to those? 
  [Romero] Will a bill be submitted to Congress to discuss how 
to replace the losses? 
  [Cardoso] No. This is not a question of law. We are here 
from 
now on to make sure this kind of issue is over. I cannot be 
responsible for what happened in the past. I am responsible from 
now on. From now on, no worker's salary will ever be below the 
cost of living. 
  [Romero] What about the public servants? 
  [Cardoso] The situation of the public servants is the same. 
I 
know they have an advantage. The public servants law readjusts 
salaries in January with zero deficit, then it loses 10 percent 
and continues to lose. This is no longer the case. The public 
servants will have the same monthly adjustment as the private 
workers. 
  [Romero] Members of the Armed Forces were demanding 50 
percent in March and will end up gaining 25 percent. 
  [Cardoso] That is not true. Take the following into account. 
In March, the readjustment for public servants will be 50 
percent. If the March inflation rate is 50 percent, they will 
come out even. You can then imagine: if the inflation rate was 
47 percent in March, the workers would gain 3 percent. If the 
inflation rate in April was zero, they would get 50 percent. 
  [Romero] The big question is, what was left behind? 
  [Cardoso] A portion of the inflation left by other salary 
laws resulting from free negotiations. Otherwise, we would fully 
adjust salaries from now on and I want to do away with that. 
From now on there will no longer be the difference between cost 
of living and salaries. Therefore, the portion left behind is 
very small and should be negotiated in the business 
organizations. The government agrees. 
  [Romero] Will the losses be negotiated freely? 
  [Cardoso] Yes, if there are any ... 
  [Romero] What will the priorities be for converting the 
minimum salary: not bankrupt the social security or give 
purchasing power to the workers? 
  [Cardoso] It will give purchasing power to the workers. Why? 
Because mainly the ones who earn the minimum salary are 
pensioners, 11,000 million pensioners earn the minimum salary. 
Minister Cutolo said they will get a real increase of 17 percent 
when the salaries are fixed in URV. Some of them will get 30 
percent. 
  [Romero] Even with the prices in dollars? 
  [Cardoso] Yes. Therefore, it is a monetary illusion for an 
individual to think: "I will earn $80." That is not true. He 
will get it 30 days later and that money will be worth much 
less. Not now. Now, he will gain. Therefore, that is the 
difference. The country must understand that difference to be 
able to see that we are really doing something, a proposal. 
Moreover, I heard from Deputy Paim and other union leaders who, 
putting aside the February issue said: Look, that proposal is 
very good." 
  [Romero] If the government does not transform its utility 
rates into URV and does not use it to correct taxes, how can you 
expect to give credibility to that index in the market? 
  [Cardoso] No, the government will use the URV to correct 
taxes because the URV is produced by three indexes, and one of 
the indexes is the Ufir [reference fiscal unit]. 
  [Romero] Will the UVR have parity with the Ufir? 
  [Cardoso] It will. 
  [Romero] From the beginning? 
  [CArdoso] From the very beginning. 
  [Romero] And utility rates? 
  [Cardoso] If I fix them in URV, what will happen? They will 
increase every day. Then, in order to be on the side of 
consumers I will adjust utility rates in a normal way, that is, 
by the real average of the past four months. 
  [Romero] Will there be rules for the conversion of rents, 
school tuitions, and health plans? 
  [Cardoso] We think the idea of the URV is to give a certain 
time for the adjustment of contracts between the parties 
involved. If they can adjust their contracts in that period and 
make them in URV that contract will no longer change. It will no 
longer change if it is written in URV. If contracts are not 
adjusted for the established deadlines to implement the real, 
then we will issue regulations.

  [Text] "Brazil's problem is not foreign enemies, the Cold 
War, or internal ideologies but its ruling elites who are behind 
the times and reactionary, and who at no time have concerned 
themselves with Brazil's growth," PT President Luis Inacio Lula 
da Silva said yesterday at a lunch for 170 businessmen at the 
Brazil-Japan Chamber of Commerce. There will be no mention in 
the PT's platform for governing of a moratorium on the external 
debt. "New financing for the production sector will be assured 
only if we renegotiate our debt," said PT Deputy Aloizio 
Mercadante from Sao Paulo, at the lunch he attended with Lula. 
  Mercadante, who is also an economist, made it clear that the 
party knows that a unilateral moratorium, should Lula become 
president, would not help the country at all. Tapped by the PT 
candidate to take the lead in drafting the economic plan for the 
would-be administration, the congressman said that "the 
moratorium is not a banner, but a political instrument." 
According to him, although the question of a moratorium is 
controversial, the platform will not deal with hypothetical 
situations. 
<H5>  Coordinator </H5>
  Mercadante was assigned to present Lula's economic program 
to 
the businessmen. It is already known that the PT president was 
extremely irritated by the preliminary proposals in the 
platform, such as the debt moratorium, and decided that 
Mercadante will be his strongman and economic spokesman in 
coordinating the plan. The deputy's presence at yesterday's 
lunch and his participation in the discussion served notice to 
the party. 
  To Mercadante, the external debt issue is not the main item 
on the internal agenda. However, that does not mean Brazil will 
not demand more compatible terms of payment, and it will be 
tough in negotiations with its creditors. "If it is compatible 
with a resumption of growth, we will work out the debt payments 
at a new level," he said. "It is not true that the entire 
external debt is to be paid under the conditions in the loan 
agreements," he argued. And he urged that dialogue and 
credibility be the hallmarks of the negotiations. 
  The PT deputy also talked about Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso's economic plan. He said his party opposes it, 
although it believes the fiscal adjustment is needed. And he 
advocated a far-reaching tax reform. "Hardly any of the cuts in 
public spending have actually been made, and the Social 
Emergency Fund took money from education, social security, and 
unemployment insurance." Meanwhile, the expenditures by the 
judiciary and legislative branches have increased. "Fernando 
Henrique has broken the force of the wind," he added. 
  As for the internal debt, Mercadante insisted that 
"unilateral actions are not part of our scenario." According to 
him, negotiations must be held to stretch out the terms of the 
debt. "The states must respect the loan agreements and fulfill 
them." In his opinion, Brazil will become modern not only by 
opening up its markets, but by redefining public policies, 
financing, and incentives to modernize and improve efficiency. 
Economic stability and an end to inflation are vital. "Stability 
is not easy to achieve, because you have to confront powerful 
interests in business sectors that are accustomed to earning 
without producing."

<F P=106> [Commentary by columnist Marcelo Pontes] </F>
  [Text] These days, when candidates are deciding whether to 
run for president and alliances are being readied, one concern 
is foremost among the parties: they know that it is not enough 
to have a good candidate; they must ensure that whoever is 
elected will actually be able to govern. 
  This would be just a routine item on the political agenda if 
today's Brazil did not have on one side an administration that 
is disoriented within the Congress, with no dependable support 
from the parties and vulnerable to surprises with every vote; 
and, on the other, a candidate for president--Luis Inacio Lula 
da Silva--who dominates the opinion polls but does not control 
his own party. Furthermore, as backdrop we have the history of a 
deposed president who restricted the concept of governability to 
his ability to simply get elected. 
  The concern for governability is in proportion to the 
difficulty the parties are having in laying the foundations for 
election-year alliances. The PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party] and PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], for example, 
have made no progress in their talks because of internal 
indecisiveness. Orestes Quercia announced his candidacy, as he 
puts it, precisely to prevent such an alliance from prospering. 
That antipathy is reciprocated within the PSDB--which, 
incidentally, was born out of opposition to Quercia by PMDB 
dissidents. 
  Quercia, in turn, is having trouble reaching an agreement 
with Sao Paulo Governor Luis Antonio Fleury Filho, whose 
favorite candidate is himself, and whose second choice would be 
Deputy Antonio Britto. 
  Since Quercia announced, Fleury seems more inclined to 
finish 
out his term as governor. Whether he stays or goes, he is 
unwilling to lift a finger to help Quercia. Even so, Fleury 
finds it hard to take a more aggressive position toward Quercia. 
With the governorship of Sao Paulo in hand, he still has been 
unable to build his own following or exercise strong leadership 
either within or outside the party. 
  No matter how much improved the conditions may be for 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso to remain as finance minister 
until the Itamar administration leaves office, the PSDB still 
considers him its favorite candidate. If Fernando Henrique is 
not nominated, the party has three other names: Mario Covas, 
Tasso Jereissati, and Ciro Gomes. 
  Covas does not want to run for president; he would rather be 
governor of Sao Paulo. He is the strongest of all the candidates 
who have showed up at the gate of Bandeirantes Palace so far. 
Tasso is the only name in the group of Ceara tucanos 
who could defeat Juraci Magalhaes, the PMDB's extremely popular 
candidate for governor of that state. As for Ciro Gomes, he has 
the reputation of being good with a megaphone, but not very 
skilled in the whispering needed to forge alliances. 
  The PFL [Liberal Front Party] is taking the opposite 
approach. Because it has no names, it is starting by developing 
a platform, while leaving plenty of room for coalitions--Maluf 
and Maluf, and Brizola and Brizola. Either of these men is 
stronger individually than their parties or any alliances the 
parties could put together. 
  From now on, we will see names emerge that although they may 
not establish themselves as candidates for the presidency, could 
at least be good campaign workers. One of these is banker and 
former Minister of Industry and Commerce Senator Jose Eduardo 
Andrade Vieira, who is working on becoming the candidate of the 
PTB [Brazilian Labor Party] with the support of the PP 
[Progressive Party]. 
  After a lengthy and intense barrage of criticisms from 
Governor Roberto Requiao, Andrade Vieira wondered how his image 
was faring in his home state of Parana. He commissioned a poll 
and found that of nine national political figures, he was the 
one least rejected by respondents; he even did better than 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso. He popped a few champagne corks and 
started organizing his campaign. 
  Although a millionaire, Andrade Vieira would not need to 
work 
too hard to come off as a day laborer in terms of accent or the 
way he cooks and debones a pacu (a fish from the 
Pantanal), or in the bravado with which he opens a 
beer bottle with a table knife. But he has to work harder when 
it comes time to discuss Brazil's problems. 
  In his head is an empirical vision of Brazil's problems--"I 
have had it up to here with the experts," he says, passing his 
right hand across his neck like a razor blade--and with 
simplistic models of government. He thinks he can solve 
everything with partnerships or sectoral chambers. After all, he 
was one of the masterminds of the sectoral chambers that, among 
other things, were successful early in the Itamar administration 
in getting the auto industry growing again. 
  His principal credential will become a slogan. It is 
The man who gets things done, a reference to a TV 
commercial his bank produced to honor small entrepreneurs. In 
this field, he is very practical. He can tell us right away how 
he would govern. He would reduce the government to 10 or 15 
ministries, would fire through the press those ministers who 
dissent with his administration, would close a whole bunch of 
state enterprises (except for two private banks that he does not 
identify), would not allow his few cabinet ministers to waste so 
much time receiving visiting deputies who come "begging" as he 
puts it, and would call on businessmen to get together and 
figure out how Brazil should grow. But if he cannot get that 
far, Andrade Vieira would accept an invitation to serve as 
finance minister.

<F P=106> [Article by Francisco Goncalves] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia--Debates during the constitutional revision 
concerning possible changes in Chapter VIII on the Social Order, 
the part that deals with the Indian issue, promise to put the 
NGO's [Nongovernment Organizations] and the Congressional 
delegation from Amazonia on a war footing. Bolstered by the 
military lobby, deputies and senators from the North will 
introduce amendments to change the way Indian reservations are 
demarcated and limit the creation of new Indian areas in the 
regions near Brazil's borders. 
  The Native Missionary Council (CIMI) has calculated that 230 
amendments have already been submitted on the Indian question 
alone. In CIMI's opinion, all but ten of them pose a threat to 
Indian constitutional rights. Among major changes is an 
amendment submitted by Senator Coutinho Jorge, (PMDB-PA) 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, Para State], that would 
insert into the Constitution an obligation for the federal 
government to consult the state governments before drawing the 
boundaries of Indian lands. 
<H5>  Retreat </H5>
  The proposal, which has won the sympathy of Deputy Nelson 
Jobim (PMDB, Rio Grande do Sul), the rapporteur for the 
revision, is being interpreted by Indian rights defenders as a 
retreat from gains made in the 1988 Constituent Assembly. 
Concerned about the proposed changes, Bishop Apparecido Jose 
Dias, the CIMI president, will travel to Brasilia to meet with 
party leaders. "The federal government must not bow to the 
states. If that amendment passes, it will be a disaster for the 
indigenous peoples," Dom Apparecido Dias warned. 
  Senator Coutinho Jorge, a former environment minister, 
defends his position by arguing that his proposal seeks to 
correct existing distortions in the mechanism for demarcating 
Indian reservations. "This is only a technical amendment," he 
said. The senator's proposal was inspired by an episode that 
occurred last year in the Para municipality of Altamira, when 
FUNAI [National Indian Foundation] began ratifying the 
boundaries of the Cachoeira Seca reserve in an area where INCRA 
[National Land Reform and Settlement Institute] had put 4,500 
settlers. Faced with this impasse, the Ministry of Justice was 
forced to annul the ratification of the Indian zone. "The 
amendment aims to prevent this kind of problem from arising," 
Coutinho Jorge pointed out. 
  Another proposal opposed by the NGO's is the plan to veto 
the 
demarcation of reserves in the 150-km strip along Brazil's 
borders. With military permission, PDT [Democratic Labor Party] 
leader Deputy Luiz Salomao (Rio de Janeiro), submitted an 
amendment that would insert the following sentence into Article 
20 of the Constitution: "Areas intended for permanent possession 
by Indians shall be demarcated outside the border strip." This 
idea was criticized by Deputy Sidney de Miguel (PV-RJ) [Green 
Party, Rio de Janeiro] who called it "completely unacceptable." 
The green congressman submitted seven suppressive 
amendments designed to prevent proposals such as the PDT measure 
from being approved during the revision. 
  According to CIMI figures, approval of this amendment would 
directly affect 200 Indian areas and about 100,000 Indians who 
now live in the border strip. To mollify those who are upset 
about this, Luiz Salomao will probably meet with representatives 
of the NGO's and the military after Carnival. The PDT leader 
argues that his amendment does not prohibit Indians from living 
in the border strip but simply takes into consideration that it 
is a national security area.

<F P=106> [By Mary Simon] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, 2 Mar (PL) -- Today in Geneva, Cuba 
distributed a secret document drafted by the U.S. Interests 
Section in Havana that demonstrates the falseness of claims made 
by the island's so-called human rights groups. 
  The report, signed by Joseph Gerard Sullivan, chief of the 
U.S. Interests Section in Cuba, admitted that cases presented by 
leaders of such small groups fail to prove they were or are in 
fact the victims of persecution or violation. 
  The document, which was sent to the Department of State, the 
CIA, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was 
circulated as Cuban Ambassador Jose Perez Novoa was responding 
to a report by Carl Johan Groth, special rapporteur of the Cuban 
Human Rights Committee (CDH). 
  After revealing ties between the CIA and such organizations, 
Sullivan called for greater cooperation between the CIA and the 
Interests Section in Havana because of the CIA's interest in the 
campaign against Cuba, which is based on the use of the human 
rights issue. 
  The number of political prisoners in Cuba is minimal, and 
after being released, they are not persecuted, discriminated 
against, or mistreated, the U.S. diplomat said. 
  The official text of the U.S. mission, which operates under 
the jurisdiction of the Swiss Embassy, states that moreover, 
most of these former prisoners request visas to escape the 
country's economic situation, not out of fear of being 
persecuted or mistreated. 
  The document, which was drafted in January under reference 
No. H/18422/693-4, admits that the Cuban Government's 
depoliticization of illegal departures from the country rendered 
the issue useless for members of those organizations. 
  It added that of the 225 cases presented to the INS during a 
visit to Havana by INS representatives in December 1993 only 47 
claimed to have participated in activities, and of those, one 
claimed to have been detained for 30 days in the past five years 
but was unable to prove it. 
  As for the other cases, the document stated that those 
involved only presented vague descriptions of their 
participation in those groups and only 19 people were admitted 
into the refugee program. 
  According to Sullivan, the activists themselves have said 
that many members of their organizations joined to obtain the 
advantages in emigrating to the United States with official U.S. 
support. 
  He specified that leaders of such groups sell apocryphal 
political guarantees [avales] to people who plan to leave the 
country. 
  Sullivan described the struggles among those groups when he 
said that: "regrettably for us, there are claims of fraud and 
discrimination among the main human rights leaders." 
  He pointed out that in view of an overall decline in the 
quality of the cases, including those involving former political 
prisoners, the office will need to work harder at identifying 
the most useful ones and at introducing additional changes to 
process them. 
  The diplomat said that to achieve this the Interests Section 
will continue to be flexible regarding cases registered so far 
even if they do not comply with all requirements, should they 
prove to be useful to U.S. interests.

  [Text] Geneva, 1 March (PL) -- Today Cuba rejected the 
report by a special rapporteur on the human rights situation in 
Cuba, because it argues that it is the result of U.S. pressures 
and does not reflect the country's true situation. 
  Jose Perez Novoa, Cuban ambassador to the Human Rights 
Commission [CDH], said in an interview with PRENSA LATINA that 
he considers inadmissible the negotiation of an anti-Cuban draft 
resolution, which is being promoted by the U.S. delegation and 
which will be submitted for a vote next week. The week of 7 
March will be the last of six during which this organization 
will meet. 
  Regarding the resolution, Perez Novoa said that his 
delegation is not troubled by the ghost of a presumed resolution 
against Cuba. He stated that it does not bother Cuba at all. 
  In this regard, he said with irony: "Perhaps it will take 
them more time to generate support for their resolution than for 
us to try to defeat it." 
  Perez Novoa noted that the idea of a special rapporteur came 
up as a result of the U.S. vendetta against Cuba, but even 
during his presentation of the report, he had to admit the 
absence of missing persons, tortures, murders, or armed groups 
in Cuba. 
  Perez Novoa regretted that the current U.S. administration 
has kept its traditional harassment position only because it 
cannot concede that Cuba has achieved a social, economic, and 
political program such as the one it has currently, despite U.S. 
hostility. 
  Because of all this, he pointed out: "We have not come here 
on the defensive and we do not feel as though we are spiritually 
or mentally sitting on the accused bench" and our actions are 
reflected in the overall CDH program, within which at least 10 
projects have been promoted or negotiated. 
  Perez Novoa emphasized that Cuba has expressed and 
reiterated 
historically its willingness to discuss its differences with the 
United States on equal sovereign conditions and without any 
strings attached, but they are the ones that deny this offer and 
reject having normal relations and discussing differences. 
  He asserted: "An example that obstinacy remains is this 
false and manipulative human rights policy, and this is why they 
seek a new resolution." 
  Perez Novoa explained that despite U.S. pressures, Cuba 
maintains a wide, open, and transparent cooperation with the 
human rights system and rapporteurs. 
  In this regard, he mentioned how, encouraged and subsidized 
by the United States, the rapporteurs receive complaints, which 
are sometimes presented to the government without any proof or 
legality. The government, in turn, has answered them without any 
doubt or fear because we have nothing to hide. 
  He added that such cooperation is valid for all countries 
without any discrimination, selectivity, or political 
imposition. He indicated that Cuba is willing to cooperate, has 
done it, is doing it, and will continue doing it. 
  Perez Novoa mentioned the time in 1988 when Cuba invited a 
CDH delegation for a visit, and met with whoever it pleased, 
made a report, which in 1989 was presented and discussed 
publicly with the media, nongovernmental organizations, and 
observers during three sessions. 
  He stated that the report was analyzed as no other has been 
in the current CDH session, and no evidence was found to justify 
that Cuba was assigned a rapporteur. 
  Perez Novoa argued that the only thing Cubans have always 
rejected and will reject in their history is that something is 
imposed upon them. He stressed that Cubans are an open, warm, 
affectionate, compassionate people, but they will never accept 
those who seek to impose their power upon them.

<F P=106> [By PRENSA LATINA correspondent Mary Simon] </F>
  [Text] Geneva [no date or agency attribution as received] 
-- Jose Perez Novoa, Cuban ambassador to the Human Rights 
Commission (CDH), stated that this nation rejects the imposition 
of a rapporteur appointed as a result U.S. pressure or attempts 
to impose any type of alternatives. 
  With respect to this issue, the head of the Cuban delegation 
participating in the 50th session of the CDH described the 
appointment of the aforementioned rapporteur as part of 
Washington's hostile and unmerciful policy toward his country. 
  In an interview granted to PRENSA LATINA [PL], Perez Novoa 
stressed that at a time when the end of the so-called Cold War 
is being used as an instrument to demand an end to hostilities 
in regions such as Palestine and South Africa, as well as 
between bloc relations, ironically, that same policy is still 
being used and reinforced against Cuba. 
  To the diplomat, it is unacceptable to discuss an anti-Cuban 
resolution promoted by the United States such as the one 
scheduled to be voted on next week when the CDH is expected to 
end its current session. 
  In this respect, Perez Novoa indicated that "we did not come 
here on the defensive, nor did we arrive and feel that we are on 
the defendant's seat." 
  This is why Cuba's participation is directed toward the 
overall context of the CDH programs which has encouraged and 
negotiated dozens of projects, some of which were approved 
already during the CDH's second voting round on Friday, 24 
February [date as received]. 
  Moreover, the Cuban delegation's participation is taking 
place in an integral, multivalent, and comprehensive manner, 
completely divorced from any perception of isolation toward 
Havana. 
  In this respect, Perez Novoa stated that they are not 
concerned or apprehensive about the ghost of an alleged 
resolution against Cuba. In nothing -- he insisted -- does this 
cause us to lose sleep. 
  The proposal for a special rapporteur came about as a result 
of a U.S. imposition in its vendetta against Cuba. During the 
presentation of the report to the general assembly, [CDH 
rapporteur] Carl Johan Goth pointed out that in Cuba there are 
no missing persons, torture, murders, or armed groups. 
  Later on -- Perez Novoa stated -- he tried to justify an 
institutional system, but what is very clear to him is that "in 
Cuba there is no indication of massive and flagrant human rights 
violations." 
  That is obvious, insisted the ambassador, who believes that 
the real source of this resolution is the hostile and aggressive 
policy of U.S. Administrations against Cuba. 
  In this respect, Perez Novoa regretted that the new 
administration still clings to such a position which has no 
basis whatsoever. 
  That is why Cuba maintains its rightful position with 
respect 
to there being no reason for selective and discriminatory 
treatment by this CDH, nothing to justify the existence of the 
rapporteur or it being included as item 12 of the agenda. 
  Nothing of the sort -- he stated -- corresponds to the true 
situation in Cuba or what its people are experiencing. 
  "They simply cannot acknowledge that Cuba has been able to 
accomplish a social, economic, and political program such as the 
one it has despite hostilities from the United States," Perez 
Novoa indicated. 
  When correlating Washington's position with respect to the 
so-called Cold War, the ambassador indicated that while the new 
administration calls for an end to the Cold War and to 
confrontation in Palestine and South Africa, as well as in 
relations between blocs, it continues and reinforces its policy 
toward Cuba. 
  How can they explain to the world that they continue this 
Cold War policy and harass our small country, the ambassador 
asked, when Cuba does not constitute any danger whatsoever to 
the United States. Today -- he indicated -- they cannot even 
resort to the false but much used argument that we are "a Soviet 
base" because the Soviet Union as such no longer exists. 
  Perez Novoa insisted that Cuba has historically maintained, 
is, and will always be willing to discuss its differences with 
the United States under an equal condition of sovereignty and 
without any preconditions. 
  The ambassador asserted they are the ones who do not want 
to accept and evade the responsibility of having normal 
relations and discussing differences. 
  "An example that obstinacy remains is this false and 
manipulative human rights policy, and this is why they seek a 
new resolution," he said. 
<H5>  Cuban Cooperation With the CDH </H5>
  Jose Perez Novoa recounted what he called Cuba's broad, 
frank, and transparent cooperation with the entire human rights 
system and rapporteurs throughout the years. 
  In this regard, he described how, encouraged and subsidized 
by the United States, the rapporteurs receive complaints, which 
are sometimes presented without any evidence, legality, or 
force. Nevertheless, he said, the rapporteurs received the 
complaints and sent them to the government. The government, in 
turn, answered them without any doubt or fear because we have 
nothing to hide, he said. 
  On the contrary, the ambassador said, we feel proud of the 
human rights situation prevailing in Cuba as few nations have 
been able to accomplish what we have in this respect. 
  He added that cooperation is valid for all countries without 
discrimination, selectivity, or political imposition. Perez 
Novoa observed: Cuba is willing to cooperate, has done so, is 
doing so, and will continue to do so. 
  On this subject, he mentioned the time in 1988 when Cuba 
invited a CDH delegation for a visit. The CDH representatives 
visited the island, met with all those they wanted to see and 
made a report. The report was presented the following year and 
discussed publicly with the media, nongovernment organizations, 
and observer governments during three sessions. 
  Perez Novoa said the report was discussed as no other in the 
CDH session and no evidence was found to justify that Cuba be 
assigned a rapporteur. 
  What's more, he said, when the issue was taken to a vote, 
they [the United States] lost. The ambassador then referred to 
the phase after the debate, when Cuba negotiated its desire to 
continue cooperative relations with the [UN] secretary general 
with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Countries 
(Grulac) [Grupo de Paises Latinoamericanos y del Caribe] and the 
EEC. [sentence as received] 
  Cuba, he said, was not included on the agenda, had not been 
assigned a rapporteur as the United States lost that vote 
(1989), and -- as was accepted by then UN Secretary General 
Javier Perez de Cuellar -- the island maintained smooth and 
transparent cooperative relations. 
  Not satisfied with the situation, Washington asked for a 
report from the secretary general in 1990, who presented it and 
had it analyzed. 
  The fact that Cuba had maintained permanent and stable 
cooperation with the [UN] secretary general was obviously 
established in the negotiations with Grulac and the EEC. 
  As it did not further [U.S.] propaganda goals to say Havana 
had been registered as a human rights case because it was under 
topic 12 or had a rapporteur, it took advantage of the changes 
in the correlation of international forces. At the time, the 
disintegration of the Socialist field had already begun. This 
situation was used by the United States to impose an amendment 
to the resolution presented by Grulac, which was signed by 
approximately 20 representatives. 
  The only thing our people have always objected to in their 
history and will continue to object to is when something is 
imposed upon them, he asserted. Our people are open, warm, 
affectionate, and compassionate, but we will never accept those 
who try to impose their power upon us, the ambassador stressed. 
  Regarding the changes [in Cuba], as they are usually called, 
they are the ones born from our own national identity, the ones 
needed by our country and, based on this, the ones being 
implemented because they are not meant to satisfy the world, he 
said. 
  The diplomat was clear when he said: "We will not turn our 
backs on the world. We know there have been changes. However, 
we also know we have to protect the great social, economic, and 
political accomplishments of the revolution, which is the 
essence of the Cuban program. [no ending quotation mark as 
received] 
  To further this objective, he manifested, we are obliged to 
make adjustments in the country -- including economic ones -- to 
secure those achievements as much as possible. What we are not 
ready to do, under any circumstances, pressure, or even under 
the threat of weapons, is to surrender our independence and 
sovereignty, he stressed.

<F P=106> [By Carlos Fazio] </F>
  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- A method used by the 
United States over and over again is to make use accustomed to 
de facto situations. A typical and current example is the 
"Strong Roads 94" operation throughout Latin America. Using the 
excuse of building schools and rural roads, the Pentagon is 
filling the region with soldiers. The goal is to get our people 
accustomed to the U.S. military presence in the area in order to 
transform local armies into police forces under Washington's 
centralized command. 
  A subject that was once in vogue had the same fate: human 
rights. During the James Carter administration (1977-1981), the 
United States started to use the human rights issue as a foreign 
policy instrument. It did this by using a large-scale apparatus 
of propaganda and reiterations. Since then and every year, the 
occupant of the Oval Office, acting as a self-imposed judge, 
jury, and executioner, drafts reports on the observance of such 
principles in the world, issues "certifications," and punishes 
transgressors by withholding economic or military aid. 
  This policy, however, has a weak side. In all cases, the 
human rights arena exists abroad. That is, they do not apply to 
the United States. That is the getting-accustomed 
[acostumbramiento] part. 
  Given that the reality differs from the situation reported 
by 
the hypocritical media, which is subordinate to the "rumor 
mills" of the State Department and Pentagon, issues like human 
rights have become real boomerangs that have hurt the apostles 
of the White House. 
  This is so because men such as Noam Chomsky, inside the 
empire, and Gregorio Selser, in Latin America, for years, have 
denounced the double standard of this scrutinizing and 
horrifying policy that locates the bad, the ugly, and the dirty 
living abroad and describes them as outlaws who deserve to be 
condemned. 
  This comes to light because the Autonomous University of 
Sinoloa, in Mexico, is presenting a reedited book by Selser (who 
passed away) entitled The Violation of Human Rights in the 
United States [La Violacion de los Derechos Humanos en Estados 
Unidos]. 
  The first edition, which mysteriously vanished, dates back 
to 
1989. It is, however, completely valid today. 
  Many 1989 human rights violators have intensified their 
actions in the United States today. 
  Groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, Moral Majority, Unification 
Church, Aryan White Resistance, among others, which were 
denounced by Selser in his book, continue to show no mercy to 
Blacks, Hispanics, and American Jews. 
  Police violence against minorities, which was brought to the 
fore in 1991 with the Rodney King case -- a colored man who was 
brutally beaten by four white policemen -- was repeated in the 
case of Lorenzo Colston, a black man who was shot in the butt on 
29 September 1993 with a Magnum 357 by a white policeman, who 
was just acquitted. Paradoxically, Colston could be sentenced to 
28 years in prison for attacking this policeman. 
  Selser's work summarizes the lengthy chain of 
discrimination, 
persecution, hostility against minorities, and ethnic conflicts 
-- now they are in vogue in Chiapas, the Venezuelan Perija 
mountain range, the Ecuadoran high plateau, and the Brazilian 
Amazon region -- like those of the Mohawk Indians in the Sain 
Regis-Akewasasne Reserve along both sides of the U.S.-Canadian 
border. 
  There is no doubt that if Don Gregorio were alive today, he 
would be reporting on Washington's flagrant violation of Article 
14 of the Human Rights Declaration that reads: "In case of 
persecution, every person has the right to request asylum and 
enjoy it in any country." The Haitians, for example, are locked 
up in a prison of terror by a U.S. blockade under the UN 
umbrella. Even the "boat people" who manage to escape the island 
are detained on the high seas by U.S. marines and turned back to 
the Raoul Cedras regime. 
  This policy of summary interdiction and repatriation is not 
only racist but also exposes the cynicism of Washington's 
so-called "humanitarian policy." 
  The participation of expert John Saxe Fernandez in the 
presentation of Selser's book, besides being a homage deserved 
by the master, will give us a closer look at this situation. In 
recent times, a favorite target of this situation have been 
Mexicans who aspire to work in the mecca of capitalism. Walls, 
ditches, and sensors are part of the new humanitarian methods 
used by border patrols against those trying to win freedom.

  [Text] Havana, 2 Mar (PL) -- Regarding the Nation and 
Immigration meeting which will be held in Havana, Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina affirmed that those who will come to 
Havana are those who respect us and do not ask for our heads. 
  Robaina reiterated that 200 emigrants living in 17 countries 
will attend the meeting, scheduled for 22-24 April. 
  While speaking at a Higher Education Ministry seminar, 
Robaina said not all the existing sectors will come to the 
meeting, and not all the topics will be covered, but regarding 
the organization, there will be a breadth that may surprise many. 
  The minister reiterated the nonattendance of those he termed 
hysterical, when he referred to the fact that critics had laid 
wagers the meeting would not be held, and he added, now they say 
only our friends have been invited. 
  Robaina pointed out that among the topics on the agenda, in 
order of importance, are matters that concern the Cuban 
community, and he announced the creation of a system in the 
ministry for dealing with the emigres. 
  He admitted that for many years in Cuba the topic of 
immigration was very politicized, and said that recently, 
departures from the country have increased due to economic and 
family problems. 
  He pointed out that the most recalcitrant of the immigration 
sectors have announced the collapse of the Cuban Government for 
35 years and that message has wearied other residents living 
abroad. 
  Referring to human rights, Robaina said that the United 
States is preparing a new offensive on the topic, which is 
debated in Geneva, and he said Cuba will not allow the entry of 
any UN rapporteur. 
  Nevertheless, Robaina added that 14 Nobel Peace prize 
winners 
are invited to tour the length and breadth of the country.

<F P=106> [By Zenaida Ferrer Martinez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 3 Mar (PL) -- Cuba is reorganizing its 
domestic and foreign economic policy to cope with the adverse 
economic and financial situation and to advance in the search 
for real development that will allow the country's reinsertion 
into the world economy. 
  Cuban Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez made the above 
statement during a conference of Higher Education Ministry 
officials, who have been meeting since last Monday with 
government and Cuban Communist Party officials. 
  Different economic mechanisms based on new laws are being 
applied, which, in addition to the changes made to the domestic 
economy such as the increase in self-employment (with nearly 
145,000 people participating since Decree 141 was passed last 
September), are a solution to the decreasing number of jobs, 
Rodriguez said. 
  Rodriguez explained that the changes (including the 
suspension of penalties for possessing dollars, opening to 
foreign capital, and other changes) could lead to a better year 
for Cuba from an economic viewpoint, especially a halt to the 
violent fall experienced between 1989 and 1993. 
  Rodriguez pointed out that the strongest of the measures 
adopted by the government in this stage is the introduction of 
agricultural cooperatives. 
  He explained that the exploitation of extensive areas of 
land 
using a large amount of imported fertilizers could not be 
continued following the collapse of the socialist bloc and the 
disappearance of the USSR (the nation's leading trading 
partners). 
  We had to make a political decision. We had to link man 
directly with his work by creating basic cooperative productive 
units, which are socialist formulas that allow peasants to feel 
like co-owners of the land. 
  We have reached the conclusion that certain unproductive 
factories cannot continue to operate, that we must review the 
payrolls, and that we must make a series of decisions to see 
that economic mechanisms are successful and that the country's 
financial situation improves. 
  The minister said all the monetary-fiscal reforms that have 
been applied and that are being studied are aimed at achieving a 
stimulating [estimulante] relationship between work and salary 
now that the country is facing the dual problem of an excess of 
national currency and foreign exchange. 
  Nevertheless, he predicted that with a change in economic 
mentality, a halt of the current crisis if not progress in the 
solution thereof should be observed in the second half of the 
year. 
  He based his optimism on the possibility of having a 
superior 
sugar harvest (or a less costly one), the increase in the price 
of sugar and nickel (and a recovery in the production of this 
mineral, which is in high international demand), the 
substitution of imports, and a significant increase in 
agriculture. 
  In this regard, he also mentioned oil exploration, restoring 
electricity to previous levels, revising storage methods for 
agricultural products, and labor reforms, which are essential to 
control a relative or absolute labor force surplus. 
  He said that Cuba has not abandoned its full employment 
policy, but to avoid identifying it with labor idleness, 
alternatives for state, cooperative, or self-employment work 
have been opened, accompanied by strict order and discipline. 
  Rodriguez said Cuba's degree of economic opening to the 
outside will always be high, with tourism as the basic program, 
followed by the export of nontraditional products, the export of 
established products like sugar, nickel, and tobacco, and with 
expeditious changes to reincorporate the country into the world 
economy. 
  Rodriguez said the country will remain open to foreign 
capital and stated that 129 associations with this type of 
financing are currently operating in Cuba. 
  He said that the most serious obstacle in the way of this 
program is the embargo that the United States has been applying 
to the country for more than three decades. To this must be 
added the country's foreign debt, which equals approximately $7 
billion. 
  There are solutions, but they are extremely complex, 
Rodriguez concluded.

  [Text] Havana, 4 Mar (PL) -- Osvaldo Martinez, the 
president of the Parliament's economic commission, anticipates 
that the Cuban economy will improve during the second half of 
1994 because of the influence of structural changes in the 
agricultural sector and the positive reaction by some sectors. 
  According to a Radio Rebelde report, Martinez, who is also 
the director of the World Economy Research Center, argued in a 
conference with journalists and students at Havana University 
that the worst was left behind in 1993 and predicted that the 
second half of 1994 will show improvement. 
  Martinez stated that the improvement will become evident 
through a stop in the fall of economic indicators, a trend that 
arose following the collapse of the European Socialist Bloc and 
the Soviet Union between 1989 and 1991, as well as through 
modest increases in some strategic sectors. 
  Martinez added that the consolidation of the Basic 
Cooperative Production Units [UBPC] with slight increases in 
food production and a significant reduction in costs will begin 
to exert a positive influence and so will the financial 
reorganization measures that will be implemented this year. 
  The UBPC operate on state property and are exploited by 
groups of workers who employ production means that were bought 
from the former agricultural-livestock enterprises. The UBPC's 
purpose is based on profitability and economic efficiency. 
  Martinez clarified that the sugar harvest and nickel 
production, whose international prices are starting to pick up, 
will constitute major sources of foreign currency as well as 
modest increases in the sale of pharmaceuticals. 
  Martinez said that the tourism industry, which has 
experienced a steady growth, plays a pivotal role in this 
process and added that this industry is expected to receive 1 
million visitors in 1994 and earn $350 million in net profits. 
  Martinez concluded that these positive factors lead him to 
predict that the national economy will perform better as of the 
second half of 1994.

  [Text] Major General Ulises Rosales del Toro, first vice 
minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR), said today 
this corps is in optimum condition to fulfill its mission due to 
its high cohesion and combative readiness. 
  In a meeting with journalists on the occasion of Cuban Press 
Day, which will be held on 14 March, Rosales del Toro said that 
the FAR are in their best stage of development, according to a 
National Information Agency report. 
  The General Staff chief argued the Armed Forces have a 
commander in chief, Fidel Castro, who is capable enough to 
continue leading the revolution, a minister, Raul Castro, who 
has much experience, and a corps of officers forged by 
revolutionary struggles. 
  Regarding the education of the new generations, the general 
cited journalists' role. Rosales del Toro, also a member of the 
Communist Party of Cuba Politburo, said the press must fight 
every formality and work for the defense of the country.

  [Text] Mexico City, 7 Mar (PL) -- After five days of peace 
talks here, the Guatemalan Government and the guerrillas have 
achieved "certain progress" for possible immediate international 
verification of the violation of human rights during the 
internal armed conflict. 
  One rebel negotiator assured PRENSA LATINA that supervision 
of violations of citizens' liberties is the sole issue making 
true progress since the current round of talks began on Thursday. 
  The source requested anonymity out of respect for the 
participants' commitment with the United Nations not to disclose 
any information to the media during the talks. Nevertheless, he 
let it slip that "tomorrow there will surely be a joint 
statement on this issue." 
  Immediate international verification, however, is only one 
of 
three issues included in the human rights issue. This in turn 
is one of the two points on the negotiating agenda together with 
the setting of a general timetable for the process. 
  So, in five days of alternate encounters by the participants 
(pendular system) with UN moderator French Jean Arnault, neither 
the creation of an investigation commission on the violations 
nor the possibility of an alleged agreement in this regard has 
been taken up. 
  The two sides have not met face to face, only communicating 
separately with the mediator. Nevertheless, each delegation 
separately admitted "progress" and even Hector Rosada, chief of 
the government delegation, talked about "75 percent progress." 
  Arnault accepted there are differences and decided to 
postpone until tomorrow the encounter that should have concluded 
today, as the extension of his consultation with the warring 
factions warranted the need to engage in one more day of 
conversations. 
  The UN official did not consider important the fact that the 
government and the guerrillas had not met together after five 
days of talks. "This does not mean incomprehension; it is only 
a technical detail," he indicated. 
  Arnault also indicated that the main stumbling block in 
outlining international verification is centered on the manner 
in which it is to be implemented. That is, is the verification 
done "in the middle of the war or after the cease-fire," he 
explained. 
  On this, there are recent precedents in Central America 
where 
the United Nations initiated investigations of the violation of 
human rights in El Salvador after the signing of the armistice 
in January 1992 between the government and the Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front. 
  Therefore, according to analysts, in no way do the end of 
war 
actions have to necessarily be a condition to start clearing up 
murders, extrajudicial executions, kidnappings, and other 
matters in Guatemala. 
  A document distributed here by the Guatemalan human rights 
organizations indicates that from June 1993 to February 1994 
there were 43 massacres, 282 murders, 45 persons declared 
missing after being arrested, 1,469 arbitrary detentions, and 
210 death threats registered in Guatemala. In addition, 19 
children were reported missing and 17 infants were found dead, 
according to the Guatemalan human rights commission. 
  Last week, the UN Human Rights Commission that meets in 
Geneva, Switzerland, decided to continue its advisory on 
Guatemala regarding citizens rights and urged the warring 
factions to sign an immediate international verification 
agreement on this issue. 
  In this regard, Arnault commented, "it is clear that the UN 
orientation fostered the parties' desire to sign an agreement."

<F P=106> [Interview with Daniel Ortega, Sandinist National Liberation </F>
Front, FSLN, Secretary General, by Maite Rico in Madrid; date 
not given; first paragraph is EL PAIS introduction] 
  [Text] Madrid--Daniel Ortega, 49, is dressed in severe 
black, an austerity broken only by a crimson scarf. The 
commander appears to have retired those thick glasses that used 
to cover his oriental eyes. He arrived in Spain last week on an 
invitation from the University of Castellon, and he has taken 
the opportunity to meet with Spanish Foreign Minister Javier 
Solana and various opposition leaders. 
  [Rico] In the past year, Nicaragua has undergone an 
escalation of actions by armed groups leading to political 
tensions. Is the country becoming polarized again? 
  [Ortega] Politically speaking, despite the confrontations, 
the polarization that led to the war has gradually subsided. 
There is better understanding than there has been in years. 
Nevertheless, we are going through a period of radicalization as 
a result of the economic policy, unemployment (we have a 60 
percent jobless rate), poverty, pressure on the productive 
sectors.... In the past four years, the neoliberalism of Violeta 
Chamorro's government has aggravated the recession. 
  [Rico] What alternatives does the Sandinist National 
Liberation Front (FSLN) propose? 
  [Ortega] We would have to begin with a national gathering of 
all political, business, and labor organizations at which the 
government would present the preliminary agreements it has 
entered into with the World Bank and the International Monetary 
Fund, so that the various sectors can express their opinions. 
What is being negotiated with these agencies are structural 
adjustments that will be binding on the country in future years. 
  [Rico] The honeymoon between the Chamorro government and the 
Sandinist Front has been eclipsed in recent months. Has the 
"cohabitation" arrangement that emerged after the 1990 elections 
been abandoned? 
  [Ortega] The situation has not been so linear; there have 
been ups and downs. The Sandinist Front has engaged in an 
opposition of constructive criticism, of coming down hard on the 
government when it proposes destabilizing measures and 
supporting it when we agree with its proposals. Right now, for 
example, we agree on the need to make common cause vis-a-vis the 
international organizations and on promoting constitutional 
reforms. 
  [Rico] Yet Violeta Chamorro has accused you of destabilizing 
the country: She has even said that you went through a 
"psychosis" because you could not accept your electoral defeat. 
  [Ortega] (Ortega smiles.) She said I was crazy. And she has 
said that several times. You have to understand that Mrs. 
Chamorro is not involved in the internal affairs of the country. 
She is a symbolic figure, the widow of Pedro Joaquin. It is the 
members of her cabinet who are in charge, and they are in the 
best position to assess what we Sandinists have done. We have 
cooperated when they have not asked us to. 
  [Rico] The game of alliances among political groups in 
Nicaragua has evolved since 1990: The pact between the 
Sandinists and the government has given rise to recent contacts 
between you and the National Opposition Union (UNO), leaving the 
government out. Everyone talks of the need for a general accord 
for the good of the country, but in fact it looks more like a 
dance for the distribution of power. 
  [Ortega] You have to look at the results. We have in fact 
been in contact with the UNO, not secretly, but in the open. And 
in November we began discussing constitutional reform with them. 
That step laid the groundwork for UNO deputies to rejoin the 
National Assembly. The results have been positive. 
  [Rico] Some groups of former combatants (Sandinists and 
Contras) are still active. Has the policy of reintegration 
failed? 
  [Ortega] These outbreaks are linked to the economic-social 
crisis. These people are ex-soldiers and demoralized peasants. 
The government signed agreements with them for land grants and 
aid, and it has reneged. The only way to solve this problem is 
to fulfill these commitments. 
  [Rico] One of the issues that has raised the most hackles in 
your country is the government's desire to remove the Army from 
the Sandinist orbit, which entails forcing your brother, General 
Humberto Ortega, to step down as defense minister. 
  [Ortega] That is a matter that has already reached the point 
of inflection, because we are pushing it through legislative 
channels so that it will not be influenced by external pressure. 
A bill to amend the law on the Army has already been sent to the 
executive branch, which will determine the time frame for 
changes in the Armed Forces. I estimate they will begin early 
next year. 
  [Rico] Will they accept this law? 
  [Ortega] Yes. No one denies that the comrades who are in the 
Army and the police are Sandinist comrades and revolutionaries, 
but they subordinate their actions to the Constitution and the 
government. 
  [Rico] Nicaragua will hold elections in 1996. Could Somozism 
reemerge as positions become radicalized? 
  [Ortega] The Somozists in fact already have something going 
in the form of the Constitutionalist Liberal Party, led by 
Arnaldo Guzman, which is very powerful. The Somozists were in 
power for more than 40 years; they established a social base and 
grew out of a historic party, the Liberal Party. And now they 
are reemerging under the banner of liberalism. They are 
Sandinism's principal adversaries. That is why we feel we must 
promote a very broad policy of alliances, a program of national 
unity. 
  [Rico] Would this alliance include the moderate sectors of 
the UNO? 
  [Ortega] Yes. It would include all sectors who are willing 
to 
strengthen the continuity of the revolutionary program, with the 
necessary adjustments, but always with a view to democratizing 
the country. 
  [Rico] Given what has happened over the last four years, is 
a 
pact of this nature possible when the presidency of the country 
is up for grabs? 
  [Ortega] Nicaragua has to come first, and any personal 
interests have to come second, or last. 
  [Rico] Is that possible, then? 
  [Ortega] Sure it is possible.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by Baltazar Jimenez, reporter for EL SOL </F>
DE CHILPANCINGO newspaper, in Chilpancingo, Guerrero State; from 
the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] 
  [Text] [Announcer] We reported to you at the start of this 
cast that three Guerrero State public security policemen were 
gunned down by shotgun fire and six others are seriously 
wounded. They were ambushed in the pre-dawn hours today [as 
heard] by a dangerous gang of criminals who operate in the 
Xapotitlan, Tablas Municipality, located high up in the 
mountains, according to information supplied by Manuel Noreno 
Gonzalez, chief of Guerrero State public security. Good 
afternoon, Baltazar. 
  [Jimenez] Good afternoon. 
  [Announcer] Baltazar, what happened this morning? 
  [Jimenez] According to a note by reporter Alfredo Guzman, 
several public security patrols were ambushed yesterday by 
excited villagers who were annoyed because several poppy 
plantations were destroyed. Three policemen were killed in the 
incident. Each received more than 15 shots in addition to the 
coup d'grace. The disturbances took place in the Atlixtlac 
Municipality. Alejandrino Campo Lezma, regional public security 
commander in Tlapa de Comonfort told the Prosecutor General's 
Office authorities that Saturday [as heard] night at about 0400, 
it was decided to carry out a patrol between the village of 
(Zaltizagua) and Oxtoepec, Atlixtlac Municipality. Campo said 
that two patrols made up of 10 men in one and seven in the 
other, began walking at night and on the way found several poppy 
plantations, which they destroyed. The commander said that the 
plantations measured 10 meters by 20 meters and they found one 
or two every kilometer. 
  In his statement it was established that it was about 2000 
on 
Saturday night when they heard several rifle shots and the 
policemen hid as best they could under trees. They ran until 
they reached Oxtoepec. There they made a head count and found 
that three were missing. They immediately spoke with the 
village police chief who promised to intercede with the alleged 
attackers to allow the policemen to look for their three 
companions who had disappeared in the shoot-out. 
  The commander stated that while speaking with the village 
police chief he saw several armed persons who arrived behind 
them and spoke in a dialect. After several minutes of 
negotiation, the armed persons allowed a search for the three 
missing public security policemen. The villagers in Oxtoepec 
allowed 10 policemen to enter, but only unarmed, to search for 
their companions. The bullet- riddled bodies were found at the 
clash site. The dead policemen were each missing their AR-15 
rifles and their three spare clips. 
  The searchers say that they found no less than 70 heavily 
armed persons who threatened to shoot and kill them. [Words 
indistinct] who moments before had negotiated their entry, so 
the policemen were not harmed. 
  Yesterday at about 1900 a telephone call was received at the 
Chipalcingo coroner's office, telling them to prepare to receive 
more bodies, because seemingly another clash had taken place, 
causing the death of several public security policemen in 
several villages near Axtlistac Municipality. Lastly, this was 
not confirmed. 
  [Announcer] This is one of the most tangled areas of the 
Guerrero mountains? 
  [Jimenez] Yes, of course. 
  [Announcer] It is one of the more distant areas? 
  [Jimenez] Yes. The dead policemen are Second Commander 
Bertoldo Flores Radilla, Second Commander Artemio Salmeron 
Quinonez, and Armando Luna Venancio. Their bodies were claimed 
by their relatives and transferred to their places of origin. 
There is no information whether any arrests have been made 
because as it is Sunday there were no public security spokesmen 
to report what would be done and what action would be taken to 
arrest the guilty. 
  [Announcer] Baltazar, the bodies are already in 
Chilpancingo? 
  [Jimenez] This is not yet known.

<F P=106> [Report by Jaime Flores from Tijuana from the "ACIR Radio </F>
News" newscast] 
  [Text] Baja California State Governor Ernesto Ruffo said 
today that the Attorney General's Office, PGR, report on the 3 
March shoot-out at the border is not in keeping with reality. 
He stressed that there are very strong interests behind the 
clashes. 
  Governor Ruffo said at a news conference in Mexicali, the 
state capital, that his administration will continue to 
investigations even though the PGR has declared the case closed. 
  In Tijuana, Jorge Alvarez Barrieri, commander of the second 
sector of the State Judicial Police, said there are political 
motives behind the detentions and arrest warrants issued against 
members of the state judicial police as charges were fabricated 
against Deputy Prosecutor Sergio Ortiz Lara and PGR Agent Juan 
Carlos Guerrero Cermeno, both of whom have been accused of 
releasing three suspects. 
  Victor Clark Alfaro, director of the Binational Human Rights 
Center, said the judicial agents who are under arrest and those 
whose arrests have been ordered are only scapegoats and the real 
culprits have not even been mentioned. Clark Alfaro has 
demanded an investigation of State Prosecutor Juan Franciso 
Franco Rios as nobody can lift a finger without Franco Rios' 
authorization. 
  The 3 March shoot-out left four people dead, including two 
members of the Federal Judicial Police and one member of the 
State Judicial Police. 
  Deputy Attorney General Alfonso Cabrera Morales held a news 
conference on 7 March and said State Judicial Police agents were 
responsible for the shoot-out as they were protecting Ismael 
Higuera Guerrero, an assistant of the Arellano Felix brothers.

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified reporter on speech by Luis Donaldo </F>
Colosio, PRI presidential candidate, during the commemoration of 
the 65th anniversary of the PRI at the Monument to the 
Revolution in Mexico City on 6 March; from the "Good Morning 
From Mexico" newscast; passages within quotation marks are 
recorded] 
  [Text] PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] members 
nationwide, including governors, attended the ceremony. This 
ceremony followed a different pattern. For instance, this was 
the first time President Carlos Salinas did not attend the 
ceremony. In addition, photographs of the incumbent president 
as the first PRI member of Mexico or other PRI founders were not 
displayed at the site of the ceremony as was done previously at 
commemorations of this type. The only photograph of President 
Salinas was displayed on a building next to the Monument to the 
Revolution -- the PRI Regional Movement Building. Except for 
Health Secretary Jesus Cumate and some undersecretaries, no 
cabinet members attended the ceremony. Colosio arrived with PRI 
President Fernando Ortiz Arana. There was no preamble prior to 
Colosio's arrival, which even surprised PRI members. Colosio 
was the only one on the stage and waited only for the 
introduction by the master of ceremonies to begin his speech. 
  In his speech, Colosio referred to the relationship between 
the PRI and the government. He said that in light of the 
elections, the PRI only asks for impartiality from the 
government. He emphasized that the times of political 
competition in the country have ended any presumptions regarding 
the presence of a state party. 
  [Colosio] "When the government has sought to monopolize 
political initiative, it has weakened the PRI. This is why 
today, in light of the elections, the PRI only demands from the 
government impartiality and firmness in the application of the 
law. We do not want concessions that are not based on votes or 
votes outside the law. [applause] Let us not seek to replace 
the responsibilities of the government, but let us not seek 
either to have the government fulfill the duties that only 
concern the PRI as a party. Today we are facing a genuine 
contest. The government will not give us the victory. It will 
only be the product of our work, our effort, and our dedication." 
  Later, Colosio pointed out that it would be very difficult 
to 
explain modern-day Mexico without considering the PRI's 
contributions. That is why, he said, those who argue that 
Mexico's democratic transformation demands the PRI's 
disappearance are mistaken. 
  [Colosio] "We offer change with direction, responsibility, 
peace, and tranquility. Those who believe that Mexico's 
democratic transformation demands the PRI's disappearance are 
wrong. Indeed we have made our mistakes, but it would be very 
difficult to explain modern-day Mexico without considering the 
PRI's contributions. This is why, despite our defamers and the 
criticism of our adversaries, we are proud to be PRI members." 
  Continuing with the electoral topic, Colosio said that the 
PRI will participate in the 21 August elections with total 
respect for Mexico's multiparty system. He stressed that there 
will only be one winner that day, and added that only the clear 
and unobjectionable victory of the Mexican people will be 
acceptable. 
  [Colosio] "For the Mexican people to obtain a victory on 21 
August, all political parties will have to abide by the law, 
without advantages granted to anyone, prepotency, abuse, or 
arbitrary actions. That is why, and in accordance with my 
demand for a democratic election, I hope Congress will implement 
the necessary electoral reforms based as always on the 
agreements parties have achieved within the framework of the 
Agreement for Peace, Justice, and Democracy signed on 27 
January." 
  Luis Donaldo Colosio commented on the participation of 
observers in the elections. He said one must not look at them 
with fear. 
  [Colosio] "The election belongs to society. For that reason, 
it cannot be a closed matter. Its pristine nature demands the 
participation of observers and does not preclude our citizens 
and visitors from abroad from giving a very thorough account of 
it. There is no reason at all to look with fear at those who 
wish to become acquainted with the nature of our democratic 
processes. Our elections -- and I am saying this with full 
conviction -- will have nothing shameful to hide." 
  Referring to the topic of Chiapas in his speech, Colosio 
said 
this situation appeals to the conscience of all Mexicans. He 
noted, however, that this proposal for change is not limited to 
Chiapas but covers all Mexicans. 
  [Colosio] "We want to keep our promises to Chiapas residents 
and also to Mexicans in Laguasteca, La Laguna, the mountains in 
Guerrero State, the northern mountain range in Puebla State, 
[name indistinct] and Alvaro Obrergon's Barranca, the Federal 
District, Ciudad Juarez's (Anapra) Port in Chihuahua State, 
Guadalajara's Insurgentes Neighborhood in Jalisco State, and 
Monterrey's Bernabe area in Nuevo Leon State." 
  The candidate commended the Mexican Army. 
  [Colosio] "Our institution proved its legitimacy and 
efficiency, emerging stronger from the solution to the conflict. 
From this dais I convey my words of praise to the Mexican Army 
for its patriotism, loyalty, and selflessness in defending 
national interests and unity." 
  Colosio criticized the attitude of PRI members regarding the 
Chiapas conflict. 
  [Colosio] "PRI members must reflect on Chiapas. As the party 
of stability and social justice, it shames us to feel we were 
not sensitive to the major demands of our communities, we were 
not next to them in their aspirations, we were not up to the 
commitment they expected from us." 
  To conclude, the PRI candidate stressed that the main thing 
he is proposing with change is change with responsibility, where 
no area of the country's life is forgotten. He reaffirmed his 
commitment to head the new phase of change in Mexico. 
  [Colosio] "With firmness, conviction, and full confidence I 
say: I want to be president of Mexico to head this new phase of 
change in Mexico!" [applause]

<F P=106> [Report by David Carrizales] </F>
  [Text] Monterrey, Nuevo Leon State, 1 Mar -- Federico Reyes 
Heroles, director of ESTE PAIS magazine, said today when 
commenting on a poll by this magazine that it is a matter of 
utmost seriousness for the country's politics when 40 percent of 
Mexicans believe there will be electoral fraud in the August 
elections, because whoever wins will have governability problems. 
  The political analyst added that according to another poll 
held in December, 41 percent of the electorate would vote for 
Luis Donaldo Colosio, 20 percent for Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and 
only 11 percent for Diego Fernandez de Cevallos. Nevertheless, 
he said these results were not published and now none of the 
political parties that support these candidates (PRI, 
Institutional Revolutionary Party; PRD, Party of the Democratic 
Revolution; and PAN, National Action Party, respectively) want 
any further polls. 
  He explained that the reasons for this are that the PRI's 
Colosio has sold the idea that he has a 65-70 percent backing, 
the PRD bases its campaign on an alleged democratic switch that 
has not taken place so far, and PAN does not want to admit that 
its rapprochement with the government has cost the party about 
eight popularity points. 
  Reyes Heroles, who inaugurated a cycle of conferences 
programmed by Monterrey's Institute of Technology and Higher 
Studies, which includes the participation of all presidential 
candidates, said that for some people it seems surprising that 
61 percent of the population backs in one way or another the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), but this can be 
explained when one takes into account that the government itself 
cultivated a cult for Emiliano Zapata and the Mexican revolution.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Sebastian Solis; from the "Good Morning From </F>
Mexico" newscast] 
  [Text] Approximately 5,000 representatives of 40 Indian and 
peasant groups in Chiapas State marched through the streets of 
San Cristobal de las Casas on Sunday to demand solutions to 
problems involving land, justice, freedom, and democracy. The 
march, which was organized by the state committee of Indian and 
peasant organizations, was also supported by 300 teachers from 
Oaxaca. Some of the groups were formed solely by women. The 
Mexican flag was carried by Indian women. 
  The demonstrators gathered in front of the municipal 
building 
and held a four-hour rally in which representatives of each of 
the participating organizations spoke. Mrs. Marcela Gonzalez 
spoke on behalf of the Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization 
[Organizacion Campesina Emiliano Zapata]. She said: 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] We are standing up for Indian 
dignity, and no one is going to bring us to our knees. [end 
recording] 
  The demonstrators demanded the reform of Article 27 of the 
Constitution, a solution to the problem of delinquent loans, 
dismissal of mayors in Chiapas, and respect for Indian 
traditions and cultures. As they marched through the city, the 
demonstrators wrote their demands on the walls of houses and 
stores. They did the same on the walls of the San Cristobal de 
las Casas municipal building.

  [Text] The Bolivian Labor Federation [COB] termed the 
popular participation bill announced on 20 February by President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada a "test tube embryo," and announced 
that labor union organizations will strongly oppose the legal 
measure, which they regard as "evil for the organized Bolivian 
movement." 
  COB Finance Secretary Carlos Camargo said the bill that has 
been submitted to Congress had "an artificial beginning" because 
it was not based on a "consensus" with representative Bolivian 
institutions. Camargo added: "It does not have the support and 
the essence of active participation by civilian society." 
Camargo then said he was optimistic that national authorities 
will reflect and discuss the bill recently proposed by the chief 
of state. 
  He reminded the government that the COB "was never against 
the implementation of a popular participation law; we did it in 
1983 with the materialization of regional health programs, which 
set the stage for a larger program." Camargo added, however, 
that the bill recently announced to the country by the president 
of the Republic does not have the support of the great national 
majority. The COB leader warned: "It undoubtedly will meet the 
peoples' opposition because a law that has this sort of 
beginning has no future." 
  Mining leader Lucio Gonzales, COB social security secretary, 
said the popular participation law is nothing other than "evil 
for Bolivian labor organizations." He charged that the 
government, deep inside, intends to "bury labor unions in 
Bolivia to make room for neighborhood and peasant organizations 
that have little experience in Bolivia." 
  Gonzales said: "They have planned this carefully; with the 
law's implementation the COB and labor union organization 
demands will unavoidably disappear, thus clearing the way for 
them to implement their anti-patriotic and anti-popular policy."

  [Text] La Paz, 6 Mar (EFE) -- Coca leaf producers and 
Bolivian police clashed violently in the Chapare region, some 
600 kg east of La Paz, during the past few hours. An 
undetermined number of individuals were injured. 
  According to Jorge Martinez, president of Chapare's five 
coca 
producers' federations, "some peasants" died during the clashes, 
a report that was denied by Interior Minister German Quiroga who 
said that only one police agent and two members of the official 
Coca Reconversion Directorate (Direco) were injured. 
  Some 50 peasants armed with machetes, stones, and sticks 
clashed on 5 March with some 100 Mobile Police Unit for Rural 
Areas (Umopar) and Direco agents who intended to eradicate coca 
leaf plantations which, according to authorities, were being 
used for drug trafficking. 
  The peasants set various Umopar vehicles on fire, but Umopar 
forces repelled the attack with machine gun fire from 
helicopters. 
  This is the second violent clash with peasants in the 
Chapare 
region within the past 10 days. The clashes are the result of 
the government's determination to destroy excess coca 
cultivation that is being used for manufacturing cocaine and not 
for the traditional and legal coca leaf consumption. 
  The interior minister today told Radio Panamericana of La 
Paz 
that the Umopar agents' operation in Chapare on 5 March only 
intended to eliminate coca plantations that include maceration 
pits, which are used for cocaine production. 
  Quiroga said the Bolivian Government does not intend to 
eliminate all excess coca leaf plantations by force, adding that 
police only seek to eliminate plantations that include 
facilities for cocaine production. 
  According to the minister, other excess coca plantations 
must 
be eradicated voluntarily by peasants with the cooperation of 
local authorities and through the alternative development 
program. 
  Chapare region peasants, however, accuse the government of 
trying to forcefully eliminate all coca leaf plantations. 
  The Bolivian Government is committed to eradicating a 
certain 
number of coca leaf plantations annually in exchange for 
substantial U.S. economic assistance. 
  Bolivia is the second largest coca leaf producer in the 
world, after Peru, and the second largest cocaine exporter in 
the world, after Colombia.

  [Text] Peasant defense patrols are patroling the Cochabamba 
tropical region to avoid a compulsory reduction of coca 
plantations. 
  There is "a group of unarmed coca producers who, at the 
first 
attempt to force them to reduce their plantations, will blow 
their pututos [native Bolivian musical instrument] to summon the 
people." 
  Felipe Caceres, conflicts secretary of the Coca Growers 
Federation, said that if necessary the growers will arm 
themselves with sticks, machetes, picks, and big hoes to drive 
away those who try to destroy the plantations without giving 
anything in exchange." [no opening quotation marks as published] 
  Caceres said that the coca growers only seek to protect 
their 
interests and that "under no circumstances do we intend to 
protect drug traffickers. We believe trafficking is one of the 
scourges to affect the Chapare zone. It brings unrest to the 
coca growers. The repressive organizations, however, should 
take care of this task. We should not interfere in this work." 
  The peasants declared a general mobilization at the 
grassroots level after government organizations this week 
destroyed seven hectares of plantations in Senda Bayer and Villa 
Pagador, the excuse being that maceration pits used for 
producing cocaine paste had been found nearby. 
  The peasant organizations have organized "union watch 
groups" 
to control any infiltration of alien individuals who seek to mar 
the coca growers' image. 
  The coca growers have thus managed to halt the government 
elimination of what it regards as surplus plantations which, 
according to the government, surpasses 35,000 hectares in the 
Chapare and Yungas region.

  [Text] Santiago, 7 Mar (EFE) -- The Chilean Air Force 
(FACh) commander, General Ramon Vega, today explained that this 
institution still has not decided whether it will purchase 
Mirage-5 fighters from Brussels as reported by the media. 
  The new acquisitions fall within an overall plan to 
modernize 
the Chilean Armed Forces' equipment, and in the FACh's case they 
are to replace the old Hawker Hunter fighters and other aircraft. 
  Gen. Vega said there is still nothing definite about the 
purchase of Mirage fighters, although he admitted "it is a 
possibility the FACh is assessing." 
  Vega made this statement after a ceremony in which he 
received a Spanish-made CASA transportation aircraft, model 
C-212, the first of a group of six to replace the Twin Otter 
aircraft that operate in southern Chile.

  [Text] Army General Raul Castro, second secretary of the 
Central Committee and minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces 
[FAR], has sent a congratulatory message to 60 canecutting 
brigades that have already cut the millionth arroba of sugarcane 
in honor of the 29th anniversary of the establishment of the 
Millionaire movement, which is being celebrated today, 3 March. 
  The brigades are made up of volunteers from the Cuban 
Workers 
Federation [CTC], regular workers, members of the National 
Association of Small Farmers [ANAP], and Youth Labor Army [EJT] 
troops from 11 Cuban provinces -- Santiago de Cuba, with 20 work 
groups, being the most oustanding. 
  The message from Raul states: Upon learning that you have 
reached the first million arrobas of sugarcane, I felt inspired 
to express my sincere congratulations. I know this is an 
achievement you repeat in every sugar harvest, but this year and 
the next have a special and historic value. 
  Raul's message goes on to say that 30 years ago, in 1964, 
two 
cane-cutting brigades set themselves the goal of cutting no 
fewer than 1 million arrobas of sugarcane during the next 
harvest. That was on 15 June 1964 at the Emilio Lesmes farm in 
Contramaestre. 
  Raul goes on to say: I had the privilege of participating in 
that memorable assembly. I understood the unprecedented and 
elevated goal that those work groups of fervent revolutionaries 
had set, and I encouraged them to make the effort to reach it. 
  Raul continues: This idea expressing the new attitude 
vis-a-vis the work done by the canecutters, now owners of the 
cane and the sugar, organized in brigades and freed from the 
hard labor of cutting by hand thanks to new machinery, caught on 
in the rest of the country. Thus, in March 1965 the Julio 
Antonio Mella Brigade from Havana Province completed the first 
million arrobas, followed by two brigades from Matanzas. 
  Raul says, further: On 3 March, our commander in chief 
presented those brigades with the first Millionaire banners 
bearing the image of Jesus Menendez. That year, attaining their 
goal, more than 100 eastern brigades reached the 
one-million-arroba mark. 
  In other words, in 1994 we celebrate the 30th anniversary of 
the the launching of the one-million-arroba movement, and in 
1995 we will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of 
this movement. You are the worthy heirs of those forerunners. 
  In the last paragraph of his message to the canecutters, 
Castro says: I hope we will remember both events in a 
revolutionary way: making the current harvest more efficient, 
working hard today and tomorrow toward the recovery of the cane 
crops, the planting campaign, and the weeding campaign -- all 
this aimed at obtaining a superior harvest in 1995. 
  Raul concludes his letter by sending a brotherly embrace to 
all canecutters.

<F P=106> [Article by Caridad Lafita Navarro--For related reporting on </F>
this issue see FBIS-LAT-94-011] 
  [Text] Is there a proposal to eliminate subsidies when a 
worker gets sick? Hesitantly, a reader asked me this question 
last Tuesday, conveying her coworker's concern to me. 
  I think that in the process arranged by the CTC [Cuban 
Workers Federation] for workers to discuss and offer their ideas 
for solutions to ease the nation's present financial situation, 
some i's need to be dotted. One of these is precisely the issue 
of subsidies. 
  Recently, and not just in my conversation with Josefa, but 
also in comments overheard while waiting in lines, on buses, and 
in some workplaces, I have found signs of confusion between the 
subsidies granted to enterprises and social security subsidies. 
  For the sake of clarity, and without going too deeply into 
the issue, I think we should clarify the differences between the 
two concepts. 
<H5>  Subsidies To Cover Losses </H5>
  Subsidies to cover losses are financial resources from the 
state budget. They are granted to state enterprises to defray 
operating losses and to offset reduced prices. 
  In his speech to the National Assembly of the People's 
Government, Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister-chairman of the State 
Committee for Finance, said that subsidies to cover losses in 
which the consequences of the adverse economic situation are 
factors--by creating substantial declines in efficiency and 
productivity--have risen more than projected, reaching 4.6 
billion pesos in 1993, 73 percent more than in 1989. 
  This impacts heavily on the budget which has a deficit, that 
is, an imbalance between income and spending, which must be 
covered. 
  We have products that need to be subsidized, as their 
production cost is high, so that the population can obtain them 
at a minimum and affordable price. Milk is an example of this; 
it sells at 25 centavos per liter, while its actual cost is much 
higher. 
<H5>  Social Security Subsidies </H5>
  Subsidies for social security purposes are another matter. 
  They are defined as monetary compensation granted until a 
worker's recovery or rehabilitation when he or she is unable to 
work due to ordinary illnesses and accidents and job-related 
illnesses or accidents. The absence is either temporary or 
partial in nature. 
  For each type of cause the magnitude of the subsidy ranges 
between 50 and 90 percent of the worker's average daily salary. 
  These subsidies come from social security funds, and have 
become a major drain on the budget. 
  Last year Cuba spent somewhat over 1.6 billion pesos for 
social security, the highest figure ever. 
  It is true that some illnesses have appeared, like optic 
neuritis, causing numerous workers to receive appropriate 
medical treatment and rest. 
  But there have also been abuses concealed by some doctors' 
complacency and kindness, allowing people to get subsidies and 
time off work that they did not need. By not producing or 
providing any service, nothing was given in exchange, and that 
burdened our social funds even more heavily. 
  The final point is, in my view, the most disturbing factor 
about compensation for illnesses or accidents: that we may lose 
control of their use and drain the already overloaded social 
protection system. We need to keep these costs within reasonable 
and necessary limits, for it would be an abuse and negligence, 
especially now, to waste what we have for situations that are 
difficult for anyone. 
  But it needs to be made quite clear, both to Josefa and her 
coworker and other people as well, that there will be no 
elimination of social security subsidies here. This guarantee 
arises from the human essence of our socialist system. It was an 
old aspiration of generations of workers and was made a reality 
by the revolution.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Tzaduq Yehezgali in Havana] </F>
  [Text] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] There are about 200 
children and young people in Cuba today who can speak a little 
Hebrew, have mastered the basic concepts of Judaism, are active 
in a Zionist youth group, and dream of really making Aliyah to 
Israel, in contrast to their elders, who see Israel as a 
stopping-point on the way to America. When we asked one of the 
community leaders this week how many would leave if the gates to 
Israel were opened, he hesitated a little and then said "about 
400 people." "And how many want to go to Miami?" This time, he 
did not hesitate even for a moment: "98 percent." 
  You could see the lightning in their eyes this week, when 
they came to meet the guests from Israel, and especially the 
chief rabbi, the most senior personage from Israel to arrive on 
an official visit to Cuba since relations were severed. They 
danced Israeli folk dances, knew by heart every word of the 
half-dozen Hebrew songs they had learned. There was not one 
young person without a Star of David around his neck. 
  "Here, together, we can forget our everyday problems," says 
Alberto Sus, the young Cuban who leads the Jewish youth group. 
The 40 youngsters go on hikes, have parties and Sabbath eve 
services, and fantasize about life in Israel. Nobody can allow 
himself the luxury of a cafe or discotheque, which are meant 
almost entirely for tourists, but who thinks about going out on 
the town--Sus told us that, "there are nights when I go to bed 
hungry." 
  But really, the situation of this Jewish young man is really 
better in many ways than that of others the same age in Cuba. If 
there is discrimination here, the ones most deprived are the 11 
million Cubans, not the 1,600 Jews. That is the reason the 
leaders of the Jewish community are beginning to suspect that 
people not Jewish in any way are suddenly declaring themselves 
Jews simply because it is convenient. 
  "What worries me," said the Communist party's official 
responsible for religions, Caridad Diego, "is that with all the 
foreign aid to the Jewish community, a privileged class may be 
created here." We talked in the meeting hall filled with gifts 
from heads of states and party leaders from all over the world. 
On the wall was a gilded map of Palestine, a gift from Arafat, 
with not a single Israeli city marked on it. Diego spoke of the 
fear of hostility toward Jews on the side of Cubans who are not 
lucky enough to get aid from overseas. 
  The situation is truly hard. There are hardly any shops in 
the streets of Havana. Occasionally you see an old Chevrolet 
from the prerevolutionary days, or a Russian "Lada," and you see 
many, many bicycles. Those who cannot even get one of these, 
drag their feet around the streets of the city. 
  Without the Russians, there are no subsidies and no fuel. 
Without fuel, there is no electricity, sometimes for most of the 
hours of the day and night. Without electricity, factories are 
closed. This domino has destroyed what the revolution built, and 
what Castro does have to give the Cubans are sayings written in 
the colors of the Cuban flag on every free wall: slogans like 
"Cuba together," or "We will win." But what do the Cubans say? 
"You don't go to the market with slogans." 
  Israel does not have diplomatic relations with Cuba. But in 
the economic realm, the Israelis have already put a foot on this 
Caribbean island. 
  There are at least half a dozen Israelis doing business 
here, 
including former adviser to the prime minister on security 
matters, Rafi Eitan. 
  The most thriving project is that of an Israeli investment 
group that grows oranges here for export. Israelis living in 
Panama import a line of products from Cuba, utilizing the cheap 
workforce and the government incentives. 
  In the black market, it is easy to get products like 
Maccabee 
beer or Telma soup nuts, imported by an Israeli businessman who 
lives here. 
  The Cubans, who are looking for every investor they can get, 
are ready to overlook the symbol of the State of Israel on the 
passport. "We know the Israelis are here," a senior official in 
the Cuban foreign trade ministry told us this week. "We would 
not be against seeing more. We need investors."

<F P=106> [Article by Ovidio Bellando] </F>
  [Text] Although Margaret Thatcher's upcoming visit to Chile 
was not on the agenda of two-day talks in Santiago between 
Argentine Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella and his 
Chilean counterpart, Rodrigo Jesus Diaz Albonico, the 
quasi-official treatment that Thatcher will receive on her way 
to the Malvinas Islands reportedly aroused Argentine curiosity. 
  Invited by the Industrial Development Association (Sofofa) 
and the Center for Political Studies, Thatcher will be in Chile 
between 20 and 23 March. 
  Thatcher will hold a 45-minute news conference on her 
administration's economic performance. A (projected) audience 
of 500 people will contribute with sumptuous fees. 
  Thatcher, her husband, and a small entourage will first 
visit 
Brazil, where she will also hold a paid lecture, which seems 
already to be regular practice for successful former heads of 
government. 
  Petrella's visit, which will conclude today, had been 
prepared before the iron lady's visit to Chile was disclosed. 
Thatcher will visit Chile shortly after President Frei's 
inauguration on 11 March. 
  Some Argentine circles believe this event represents the 
Chilean Christian Democratic Party's leaning toward the British 
Conservative Party's iron hand. The British Conservative Party 
supports the islanders' unyielding position at a time when our 
diplomacy is conducting various actions concerning the 
century-old Malvinas Islands issue. 
  Although this does not seem to be entirely the case, there 
is 
a real bias: The official facilities for Thatcher's visit to 
the Malvinas Islands. Nevertheless, based on pragmatism, the 
Foreign Ministry is minimizing her visit. 
  Experts say: "In the old days, the political willingness of 
government officials guided economic cooperation. Nowadays it 
is the other way around." 
  Trade with Chile was over $1 billion in 1993 (with a small 
surplus for Chile), not counting the $200 to $400 million 
contributed by tourism. After Japan and the EEC, Argentina is 
Chile's number three partner. Chile has invested $1 billion in 
Argentina. Why, then, these annoyed attitudes? 
  We don't know if Petrella, at his level and with 
interlocutors who are ending their tenure, managed to make his 
interlocutors understand "the Argentine surprise." 
  What Argentine diplomatic circles do actually trust in is 
the 
equilibrium that Carlos Figueroa, Frei's foreign minister, has 
demonstrated during his outstanding performance as Chilean 
ambassador to Argentina; and in Diaz Albonico, who, along with 
current Interior Minister Enrique Krauss and Edmundo Vargas, the 
current Chilean ambassador to Argentina, are included on a list 
of three candidates to occupy the embassy on Tagle Street. 
  Distrustful people associate Thatcher's visit to Chile and 
the Malvinas Islands with the possibility of counteracting the 
participation of four Malvinas Islands personalities, including 
the tourism director, in a conference sponsored by CARI 
[Argentine Council for International Relations] in Mendoza to 
review an improvement of the situation.

<F P=106> [Report by LA NACION special correspondent Eduardo De Simone </F>
from Madrid] 
  [Text] The Argentine Administration hopes that Brazil's 
recent economic plan will help shorten the deadlines for 
integration within the framework of the Common Market of the 
South [Mercosur]. Many people believe that Brazil's new 
economic plan will help reduce the economic differences between 
that country and Argentina. 
  The economic plan which Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso launched had been "continuously discussed" with 
the Argentine economic team due to the excellent relations 
between the two administrations. 
  Government officials and businessmen who are attending the 
Seminar on Business Opportunities in Argentina and the Mercosur 
which will end today in Madrid informally evaluated the 
repercussions of Brazil's new economic plan. 
  Carlos Sanchez, Argentine Economy Ministry secretary for 
investments and foreign trade, stated that the implementation of 
measures which will put an end to the indexing of Brazilian 
economy and will reduce public deficit is very positive. 
  Sanchez added that concrete effects of these measures will 
be 
perceived starting next year and Argentina will benefit from 
them. 
  The Argentine economic team believes that the measures 
Cardoso has proposed will increase the value of Brazilian 
currency and Argentina will benefit from the exchange rate. It 
is well-known that Argentina has a large deficit in its trade 
with Brazil. 
  Carlos Leone, chairman of the Argentine Steel Comany Inc. 
said: "Brazil's program is positive because the exchange rate 
will be more favorable to Argentina. Leone emphasized that 
Brazil's decision to curb its fiscal deficit is praiseworthy. 
  Angel Perversi, vice chairman of the Bunge and Born Company 
stated: "This plan is an improvement over what they now have," 
but he chose to be cautious. "Let us wait for results," he 
said. In any case, Perversi's advice was that Brazil's changes 
should not lull us to sleep. "We should focus on retrofitting 
and the changes we can make ourselves," he told LA NACION. 
  Argentine Industrial Union President Jorge Blanco Villegas 
stated: "Trade with Brazil will improve as soon as Brazil 
improves." He added: "We hope that Brazil will succeed, although 
it is a very complex plan." Villegas emphasized that "there 
have been many other programs, all of which have failed." 
  The truth is that most businessmen who came to Madrid are 
still waiting for a change in the economic situation of the main 
Mercosur partner. Further negotiations for the establishment of 
a common market are fraught with uncertainties which could be 
cleared gradually if the new plan works out. 
  The somewhat lukewarm enthusiasm of government officials and 
businessmen moved President Carlos Menem to forecast: "Mercosur 
will be beneficial to all American countries, including the 
United States." 
  Everyone is wholeheartedly praying that this is not just 
another episode in the comings and goings of regional 
integration.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcia Carmo from Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] Although he has not joined any political party since 
he left the PRN [National Reconstruction Party] in 1992, 
President Itamar Franco has made up his mind to participate in 
this year's elections. He has already told some of his friends 
that, being a politician, he does not plan to remain aloof from 
the race. According to the president "this is part of the 
presidential system and democracy." 
  On the last day of Carnival, Franco said that "should" 
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso become a candidate, 
he, Franco, would support him. Although his statements to this 
effect have prompted negative reactions, the president insists 
that the finance minister is the ideal candidate. He does 
emphasize, however, that he will give Cardoso his explicit 
support only after the latter makes up his mind to run for 
president. People who are close to the president have said that 
Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho could be the 
president's second choice. 
  Franco, who has been in politics for more than 30 years and 
is one of the founders of the MDB [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement], is also planning to influence the elections in Minas 
Gerais State. To this end he has been holding frequent talks 
with Governor Helio Garcia. An old local politician who is 
close to both the president and the governor has said: "Minas 
Gerais will set an example of unity." 
  Last week, Deputy Israel Pinheiro Filho (PRS) [Social Reform 
Party] -- who is also from Minas Gerais -- was running around 
Congress pushing yet another proposal: to get dissatisfied 
members of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and 
the PFL [Liberal Front Party] to join forces with the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party] to support one candidate on 
whom they could all agree. He believes that this group could 
establish a new party which the president could join. This, 
however, is not in Franco's plans. He believes that being 
nonpartisan he is free to support any candidate he wants. 
  Time and again Cardoso's name crops up as Planalto Palace's 
ideal candidate. The reason is simple enough: Even those who, 
until recently, looked upon his good standing with the president 
with rabid envy, now consider him a magician. The main cause 
for the mixed feeling of awe and admiration is the fact that the 
people do not hold the minister directly responsible for the 
high inflation. 
  One of Franco's friends wondered: "How can a man under whose 
management inflation is as high as it is now walk the streets of 
Rio de Janeiro and be cheered?" He added: "This means that 
whether he wants it or not, he is a prime candidate. Therefore, 
why shouldn't he have the president's support?" 
  Six months ago Franco did not display the enthusiasm and 
willingness to participate in the elections that he now has. He 
was dispirited, overwhelmed by too many problems, and counting 
the days left before he could step down. Now, as he has said 
himself, he has returned to Brasilia "reinvigorated" after the 
Carnival celebrations. 
  After a survey of his administration which will be released 
in the course of an advertising campaign called "The 
Administration Puts the House in Order," Franco has been in a 
good mood, and is determined to stand up more for his 
administration, be it during trips to inaugurate projects or at 
Government House. According to high-ranking government 
officials, this could give Franco the credentials he needs to 
influence his own succession.

  [Text] Fortaleza--Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes (PSDB) 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party] has said he is not a 
candidate for president of Brazil and would not accept the 
invitation if nominated. Gomes is willing to record his 
statement at a notary's office. At a meeting with Sao Paulo 
Senator Mario Covas, PSDB President Tasso Jereissati, and 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Gomes said his name is not 
available. "There are people better qualified than I in the PSDB 
hierarchy. I have already served four [as published] interrupted 
terms of office--two as deputy and one as mayor of Fortaleza," 
he said. 
  Ciro said his youth is another reason he would not agree to 
run: "I am distressingly similar to Collor, but I'm not a 
thief," and announced his plan to pursue graduate studies at 
Harvard, in the United States. In March, he will find out 
whether his application for a grant to study at the Institute 
for International Affairs has been approved. He would spend two 
years there writing a thesis on "Political Aspects of Inflation 
in Brazil."

<F P=106> [Interview with Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Henrique </F>
Cardoso by Cristiano Romero on 27 February -- place not given] 
  [Text] [Romero] Yesterday Deputy Paulo Paim said that he 
heard you say that those businessmen who want to convert their 
prices into URV [Real Value Unit] will have to discuss this with 
the Finance Ministry. 
  [Cardoso] Prices will not be converted into URV. The reason 
is that if prices are converted into URV the initial advantage I 
am granting salary earners will disappear because prices will 
also be subject to a unit that may increase on a daily basis. 
It is worse because salaries are corrected on a monthly basis 
while prices vary on a daily basis. 
  [Romero] If the businessmen choose to convert their prices 
into URV, will they be able to do so? 
  [Cardoso] No. The prices can only be set in real cruzeiros. 
Of course, they can say how many URV's the product is worth, but 
then the URV has to be a fixed unit. An example: It is worth 
10 URV's. They could say what 10 URV's are worth every day. The 
URV would have to be fixed but we are not encouraging the 
conversion of the URV into a real cruzeiro because that is going 
to happen later on when we implement the real. 
  [Romero] The businessmens' price lists are dollarized. 
Suppose they decide to adopt the URV, will they able to do so 
freely or will they have to go to the Finance Ministry 
beforehand to negotiate the conversion value? 
  [Cardoso] Nobody will have to go to the Finance Ministry. 
Because they will, among each other, among parties, adopt the 
dollar or whatever they want as they do now. What they cannot 
do is to exhibit the price only in URV's. 
  [Romero] What about speculative increases? 
  [Cardoso] Look here, speculative increases will make no 
sense from now on because speculating automatically causes 
salaries to increase. 
  [Romero] Will there be any means to fight speculation? 
  [Cardoso] There is no need due to the method we will use. 
We are fully protecting salaries. From now on there will be no 
more discussions. I see so many worried labor union leaders but 
from now on they will have to worry about something else because 
the argument, which has been valid up to now, about "the 
government having to adjust, about the peak, the average," will 
disappear with this. From now on salaries will adjust 
automatically. 
  [Moreno] How is the government going to control price 
abuses? 
  [Cardoso] You will see what mechanism we use when the 
problem surfaces but in a competitive market the market itself 
takes care of this problem. The problem is the public 
monopolies, the existing monopolies, the oligopolies, and for 
these we have adequate tools. 
  [Romero] How was the minimum salary value established? It 
seems that during yesterday's meeting, the president himself 
requested an effort to improve the minimum salary value? 
  [Cardoso] Nothing of the sort. There was no specific 
discussion on the subject. The minimum salary issue does not 
fall directly under the Finance Ministry, it concerns the Social 
Security Ministry. Brazilian laws tie one thing to another. 
Therefore, every time the minimum salary increases a bit it 
causes a serious problem for the Social Security Ministry. I 
believe we must struggle very hard now and during the 
constitutional revision to break these ties and give the 
pensioners another type of guarantee. 
  [Romero] Will the minimum salary remain at $64 at the 
commercial exchange rate? 
  [Cardoso] I do not know. I do not know what the exchange 
rate will be on the day they are fixed. We have not finished 
discussing this issue. I only want to point out that the 
Finance Ministry is not causing any difficulties. The 
difficulties stem from that real impasse. 
  [Romero] What about the disagreements between the Labor and 
Finance Ministries? 
  [Cardoso] There are no disagreements between these 
ministries. Yesterday the Labor Ministry experts produced a list 
but it was wrong. I will explain this once again because it is 
very simple. What we are telling the country -- and we are going 
to stress it tomorrow -- is: look, prices are increasing, 
therefore, we must protect salary earners. What is the best 
guarantee you can give salary earners? Transform their salaries 
into something that varies as the cost of living varies. That 
is the URV. From now on, once the URV has been approved, nobody 
needs to worry about the adjustment any more because it will be 
automatic. 
  [Romero] Yesterday experts left the Finance Ministry 
commenting that February inflation would be absorbed? 
  [Cardoso] Look, I do not know because I am not an expert on 
the subject. I do not know what that means. I think I can 
guarantee what will happen from 1 March on. What happened 
before then is something that must be discussed by the labor 
unions, businessmen, and the business chambers. The government 
is more than willing to solve the problem but it is not 
something that can be solved by law. We must say that, from now 
on, we have changed the rules. We have changed the rules to 
benefit the workers. People must understand this. There is no 
point in talking about the past to forecast the future, which is 
going to be different. 
  [Romero] Will some job categories lose money? 
  [Cardoso] If any category has a small loss, an adjustment 
can 
be made and this varies from one category to another. There can 
be losses in the first month, only in March, but there will be 
gains in the following months. But how can the adjustments be 
made? Through business organizations, labor courts. The 
government favors an adjustment if there are losses in some 
categories. Others will have gains. What will happen to those? 
  [Romero] Will a bill be submitted to Congress to discuss how 
to replace the losses? 
  [Cardoso] No. This is not a question of law. We are here 
from 
now on to make sure this kind of issue is over. I cannot be 
responsible for what happened in the past. I am responsible from 
now on. From now on, no worker's salary will ever be below the 
cost of living. 
  [Romero] What about the public servants? 
  [Cardoso] The situation of the public servants is the same. 
I 
know they have an advantage. The public servants law readjusts 
salaries in January with zero deficit, then it loses 10 percent 
and continues to lose. This is no longer the case. The public 
servants will have the same monthly adjustment as the private 
workers. 
  [Romero] Members of the Armed Forces were demanding 50 
percent in March and will end up gaining 25 percent. 
  [Cardoso] That is not true. Take the following into account. 
In March, the readjustment for public servants will be 50 
percent. If the March inflation rate is 50 percent, they will 
come out even. You can then imagine: if the inflation rate was 
47 percent in March, the workers would gain 3 percent. If the 
inflation rate in April was zero, they would get 50 percent. 
  [Romero] The big question is, what was left behind? 
  [Cardoso] A portion of the inflation left by other salary 
laws resulting from free negotiations. Otherwise, we would fully 
adjust salaries from now on and I want to do away with that. 
From now on there will no longer be the difference between cost 
of living and salaries. Therefore, the portion left behind is 
very small and should be negotiated in the business 
organizations. The government agrees. 
  [Romero] Will the losses be negotiated freely? 
  [Cardoso] Yes, if there are any ... 
  [Romero] What will the priorities be for converting the 
minimum salary: not bankrupt the social security or give 
purchasing power to the workers? 
  [Cardoso] It will give purchasing power to the workers. Why? 
Because mainly the ones who earn the minimum salary are 
pensioners, 11,000 million pensioners earn the minimum salary. 
Minister Cutolo said they will get a real increase of 17 percent 
when the salaries are fixed in URV. Some of them will get 30 
percent. 
  [Romero] Even with the prices in dollars? 
  [Cardoso] Yes. Therefore, it is a monetary illusion for an 
individual to think: "I will earn $80." That is not true. He 
will get it 30 days later and that money will be worth much 
less. Not now. Now, he will gain. Therefore, that is the 
difference. The country must understand that difference to be 
able to see that we are really doing something, a proposal. 
Moreover, I heard from Deputy Paim and other union leaders who, 
putting aside the February issue said: Look, that proposal is 
very good." 
  [Romero] If the government does not transform its utility 
rates into URV and does not use it to correct taxes, how can you 
expect to give credibility to that index in the market? 
  [Cardoso] No, the government will use the URV to correct 
taxes because the URV is produced by three indexes, and one of 
the indexes is the Ufir [reference fiscal unit]. 
  [Romero] Will the UVR have parity with the Ufir? 
  [Cardoso] It will. 
  [Romero] From the beginning? 
  [CArdoso] From the very beginning. 
  [Romero] And utility rates? 
  [Cardoso] If I fix them in URV, what will happen? They will 
increase every day. Then, in order to be on the side of 
consumers I will adjust utility rates in a normal way, that is, 
by the real average of the past four months. 
  [Romero] Will there be rules for the conversion of rents, 
school tuitions, and health plans? 
  [Cardoso] We think the idea of the URV is to give a certain 
time for the adjustment of contracts between the parties 
involved. If they can adjust their contracts in that period and 
make them in URV that contract will no longer change. It will no 
longer change if it is written in URV. If contracts are not 
adjusted for the established deadlines to implement the real, 
then we will issue regulations.

  [Text] "Brazil's problem is not foreign enemies, the Cold 
War, or internal ideologies but its ruling elites who are behind 
the times and reactionary, and who at no time have concerned 
themselves with Brazil's growth," PT President Luis Inacio Lula 
da Silva said yesterday at a lunch for 170 businessmen at the 
Brazil-Japan Chamber of Commerce. There will be no mention in 
the PT's platform for governing of a moratorium on the external 
debt. "New financing for the production sector will be assured 
only if we renegotiate our debt," said PT Deputy Aloizio 
Mercadante from Sao Paulo, at the lunch he attended with Lula. 
  Mercadante, who is also an economist, made it clear that the 
party knows that a unilateral moratorium, should Lula become 
president, would not help the country at all. Tapped by the PT 
candidate to take the lead in drafting the economic plan for the 
would-be administration, the congressman said that "the 
moratorium is not a banner, but a political instrument." 
According to him, although the question of a moratorium is 
controversial, the platform will not deal with hypothetical 
situations. 
<H5>  Coordinator </H5>
  Mercadante was assigned to present Lula's economic program 
to 
the businessmen. It is already known that the PT president was 
extremely irritated by the preliminary proposals in the 
platform, such as the debt moratorium, and decided that 
Mercadante will be his strongman and economic spokesman in 
coordinating the plan. The deputy's presence at yesterday's 
lunch and his participation in the discussion served notice to 
the party. 
  To Mercadante, the external debt issue is not the main item 
on the internal agenda. However, that does not mean Brazil will 
not demand more compatible terms of payment, and it will be 
tough in negotiations with its creditors. "If it is compatible 
with a resumption of growth, we will work out the debt payments 
at a new level," he said. "It is not true that the entire 
external debt is to be paid under the conditions in the loan 
agreements," he argued. And he urged that dialogue and 
credibility be the hallmarks of the negotiations. 
  The PT deputy also talked about Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso's economic plan. He said his party opposes it, 
although it believes the fiscal adjustment is needed. And he 
advocated a far-reaching tax reform. "Hardly any of the cuts in 
public spending have actually been made, and the Social 
Emergency Fund took money from education, social security, and 
unemployment insurance." Meanwhile, the expenditures by the 
judiciary and legislative branches have increased. "Fernando 
Henrique has broken the force of the wind," he added. 
  As for the internal debt, Mercadante insisted that 
"unilateral actions are not part of our scenario." According to 
him, negotiations must be held to stretch out the terms of the 
debt. "The states must respect the loan agreements and fulfill 
them." In his opinion, Brazil will become modern not only by 
opening up its markets, but by redefining public policies, 
financing, and incentives to modernize and improve efficiency. 
Economic stability and an end to inflation are vital. "Stability 
is not easy to achieve, because you have to confront powerful 
interests in business sectors that are accustomed to earning 
without producing."

<F P=106> [Commentary by columnist Marcelo Pontes] </F>
  [Text] These days, when candidates are deciding whether to 
run for president and alliances are being readied, one concern 
is foremost among the parties: they know that it is not enough 
to have a good candidate; they must ensure that whoever is 
elected will actually be able to govern. 
  This would be just a routine item on the political agenda if 
today's Brazil did not have on one side an administration that 
is disoriented within the Congress, with no dependable support 
from the parties and vulnerable to surprises with every vote; 
and, on the other, a candidate for president--Luis Inacio Lula 
da Silva--who dominates the opinion polls but does not control 
his own party. Furthermore, as backdrop we have the history of a 
deposed president who restricted the concept of governability to 
his ability to simply get elected. 
  The concern for governability is in proportion to the 
difficulty the parties are having in laying the foundations for 
election-year alliances. The PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party] and PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], for example, 
have made no progress in their talks because of internal 
indecisiveness. Orestes Quercia announced his candidacy, as he 
puts it, precisely to prevent such an alliance from prospering. 
That antipathy is reciprocated within the PSDB--which, 
incidentally, was born out of opposition to Quercia by PMDB 
dissidents. 
  Quercia, in turn, is having trouble reaching an agreement 
with Sao Paulo Governor Luis Antonio Fleury Filho, whose 
favorite candidate is himself, and whose second choice would be 
Deputy Antonio Britto. 
  Since Quercia announced, Fleury seems more inclined to 
finish 
out his term as governor. Whether he stays or goes, he is 
unwilling to lift a finger to help Quercia. Even so, Fleury 
finds it hard to take a more aggressive position toward Quercia. 
With the governorship of Sao Paulo in hand, he still has been 
unable to build his own following or exercise strong leadership 
either within or outside the party. 
  No matter how much improved the conditions may be for 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso to remain as finance minister 
until the Itamar administration leaves office, the PSDB still 
considers him its favorite candidate. If Fernando Henrique is 
not nominated, the party has three other names: Mario Covas, 
Tasso Jereissati, and Ciro Gomes. 
  Covas does not want to run for president; he would rather be 
governor of Sao Paulo. He is the strongest of all the candidates 
who have showed up at the gate of Bandeirantes Palace so far. 
Tasso is the only name in the group of Ceara tucanos 
who could defeat Juraci Magalhaes, the PMDB's extremely popular 
candidate for governor of that state. As for Ciro Gomes, he has 
the reputation of being good with a megaphone, but not very 
skilled in the whispering needed to forge alliances. 
  The PFL [Liberal Front Party] is taking the opposite 
approach. Because it has no names, it is starting by developing 
a platform, while leaving plenty of room for coalitions--Maluf 
and Maluf, and Brizola and Brizola. Either of these men is 
stronger individually than their parties or any alliances the 
parties could put together. 
  From now on, we will see names emerge that although they may 
not establish themselves as candidates for the presidency, could 
at least be good campaign workers. One of these is banker and 
former Minister of Industry and Commerce Senator Jose Eduardo 
Andrade Vieira, who is working on becoming the candidate of the 
PTB [Brazilian Labor Party] with the support of the PP 
[Progressive Party]. 
  After a lengthy and intense barrage of criticisms from 
Governor Roberto Requiao, Andrade Vieira wondered how his image 
was faring in his home state of Parana. He commissioned a poll 
and found that of nine national political figures, he was the 
one least rejected by respondents; he even did better than 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso. He popped a few champagne corks and 
started organizing his campaign. 
  Although a millionaire, Andrade Vieira would not need to 
work 
too hard to come off as a day laborer in terms of accent or the 
way he cooks and debones a pacu (a fish from the 
Pantanal), or in the bravado with which he opens a 
beer bottle with a table knife. But he has to work harder when 
it comes time to discuss Brazil's problems. 
  In his head is an empirical vision of Brazil's problems--"I 
have had it up to here with the experts," he says, passing his 
right hand across his neck like a razor blade--and with 
simplistic models of government. He thinks he can solve 
everything with partnerships or sectoral chambers. After all, he 
was one of the masterminds of the sectoral chambers that, among 
other things, were successful early in the Itamar administration 
in getting the auto industry growing again. 
  His principal credential will become a slogan. It is 
The man who gets things done, a reference to a TV 
commercial his bank produced to honor small entrepreneurs. In 
this field, he is very practical. He can tell us right away how 
he would govern. He would reduce the government to 10 or 15 
ministries, would fire through the press those ministers who 
dissent with his administration, would close a whole bunch of 
state enterprises (except for two private banks that he does not 
identify), would not allow his few cabinet ministers to waste so 
much time receiving visiting deputies who come "begging" as he 
puts it, and would call on businessmen to get together and 
figure out how Brazil should grow. But if he cannot get that 
far, Andrade Vieira would accept an invitation to serve as 
finance minister.

<F P=106> [Article by Francisco Goncalves] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia--Debates during the constitutional revision 
concerning possible changes in Chapter VIII on the Social Order, 
the part that deals with the Indian issue, promise to put the 
NGO's [Nongovernment Organizations] and the Congressional 
delegation from Amazonia on a war footing. Bolstered by the 
military lobby, deputies and senators from the North will 
introduce amendments to change the way Indian reservations are 
demarcated and limit the creation of new Indian areas in the 
regions near Brazil's borders. 
  The Native Missionary Council (CIMI) has calculated that 230 
amendments have already been submitted on the Indian question 
alone. In CIMI's opinion, all but ten of them pose a threat to 
Indian constitutional rights. Among major changes is an 
amendment submitted by Senator Coutinho Jorge, (PMDB-PA) 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, Para State], that would 
insert into the Constitution an obligation for the federal 
government to consult the state governments before drawing the 
boundaries of Indian lands. 
<H5>  Retreat </H5>
  The proposal, which has won the sympathy of Deputy Nelson 
Jobim (PMDB, Rio Grande do Sul), the rapporteur for the 
revision, is being interpreted by Indian rights defenders as a 
retreat from gains made in the 1988 Constituent Assembly. 
Concerned about the proposed changes, Bishop Apparecido Jose 
Dias, the CIMI president, will travel to Brasilia to meet with 
party leaders. "The federal government must not bow to the 
states. If that amendment passes, it will be a disaster for the 
indigenous peoples," Dom Apparecido Dias warned. 
  Senator Coutinho Jorge, a former environment minister, 
defends his position by arguing that his proposal seeks to 
correct existing distortions in the mechanism for demarcating 
Indian reservations. "This is only a technical amendment," he 
said. The senator's proposal was inspired by an episode that 
occurred last year in the Para municipality of Altamira, when 
FUNAI [National Indian Foundation] began ratifying the 
boundaries of the Cachoeira Seca reserve in an area where INCRA 
[National Land Reform and Settlement Institute] had put 4,500 
settlers. Faced with this impasse, the Ministry of Justice was 
forced to annul the ratification of the Indian zone. "The 
amendment aims to prevent this kind of problem from arising," 
Coutinho Jorge pointed out. 
  Another proposal opposed by the NGO's is the plan to veto 
the 
demarcation of reserves in the 150-km strip along Brazil's 
borders. With military permission, PDT [Democratic Labor Party] 
leader Deputy Luiz Salomao (Rio de Janeiro), submitted an 
amendment that would insert the following sentence into Article 
20 of the Constitution: "Areas intended for permanent possession 
by Indians shall be demarcated outside the border strip." This 
idea was criticized by Deputy Sidney de Miguel (PV-RJ) [Green 
Party, Rio de Janeiro] who called it "completely unacceptable." 
The green congressman submitted seven suppressive 
amendments designed to prevent proposals such as the PDT measure 
from being approved during the revision. 
  According to CIMI figures, approval of this amendment would 
directly affect 200 Indian areas and about 100,000 Indians who 
now live in the border strip. To mollify those who are upset 
about this, Luiz Salomao will probably meet with representatives 
of the NGO's and the military after Carnival. The PDT leader 
argues that his amendment does not prohibit Indians from living 
in the border strip but simply takes into consideration that it 
is a national security area.

<F P=106> [By Mary Simon] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, 2 Mar (PL) -- Today in Geneva, Cuba 
distributed a secret document drafted by the U.S. Interests 
Section in Havana that demonstrates the falseness of claims made 
by the island's so-called human rights groups. 
  The report, signed by Joseph Gerard Sullivan, chief of the 
U.S. Interests Section in Cuba, admitted that cases presented by 
leaders of such small groups fail to prove they were or are in 
fact the victims of persecution or violation. 
  The document, which was sent to the Department of State, the 
CIA, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was 
circulated as Cuban Ambassador Jose Perez Novoa was responding 
to a report by Carl Johan Groth, special rapporteur of the Cuban 
Human Rights Committee (CDH). 
  After revealing ties between the CIA and such organizations, 
Sullivan called for greater cooperation between the CIA and the 
Interests Section in Havana because of the CIA's interest in the 
campaign against Cuba, which is based on the use of the human 
rights issue. 
  The number of political prisoners in Cuba is minimal, and 
after being released, they are not persecuted, discriminated 
against, or mistreated, the U.S. diplomat said. 
  The official text of the U.S. mission, which operates under 
the jurisdiction of the Swiss Embassy, states that moreover, 
most of these former prisoners request visas to escape the 
country's economic situation, not out of fear of being 
persecuted or mistreated. 
  The document, which was drafted in January under reference 
No. H/18422/693-4, admits that the Cuban Government's 
depoliticization of illegal departures from the country rendered 
the issue useless for members of those organizations. 
  It added that of the 225 cases presented to the INS during a 
visit to Havana by INS representatives in December 1993 only 47 
claimed to have participated in activities, and of those, one 
claimed to have been detained for 30 days in the past five years 
but was unable to prove it. 
  As for the other cases, the document stated that those 
involved only presented vague descriptions of their 
participation in those groups and only 19 people were admitted 
into the refugee program. 
  According to Sullivan, the activists themselves have said 
that many members of their organizations joined to obtain the 
advantages in emigrating to the United States with official U.S. 
support. 
  He specified that leaders of such groups sell apocryphal 
political guarantees [avales] to people who plan to leave the 
country. 
  Sullivan described the struggles among those groups when he 
said that: "regrettably for us, there are claims of fraud and 
discrimination among the main human rights leaders." 
  He pointed out that in view of an overall decline in the 
quality of the cases, including those involving former political 
prisoners, the office will need to work harder at identifying 
the most useful ones and at introducing additional changes to 
process them. 
  The diplomat said that to achieve this the Interests Section 
will continue to be flexible regarding cases registered so far 
even if they do not comply with all requirements, should they 
prove to be useful to U.S. interests.

  [Text] Geneva, 1 March (PL) -- Today Cuba rejected the 
report by a special rapporteur on the human rights situation in 
Cuba, because it argues that it is the result of U.S. pressures 
and does not reflect the country's true situation. 
  Jose Perez Novoa, Cuban ambassador to the Human Rights 
Commission [CDH], said in an interview with PRENSA LATINA that 
he considers inadmissible the negotiation of an anti-Cuban draft 
resolution, which is being promoted by the U.S. delegation and 
which will be submitted for a vote next week. The week of 7 
March will be the last of six during which this organization 
will meet. 
  Regarding the resolution, Perez Novoa said that his 
delegation is not troubled by the ghost of a presumed resolution 
against Cuba. He stated that it does not bother Cuba at all. 
  In this regard, he said with irony: "Perhaps it will take 
them more time to generate support for their resolution than for 
us to try to defeat it." 
  Perez Novoa noted that the idea of a special rapporteur came 
up as a result of the U.S. vendetta against Cuba, but even 
during his presentation of the report, he had to admit the 
absence of missing persons, tortures, murders, or armed groups 
in Cuba. 
  Perez Novoa regretted that the current U.S. administration 
has kept its traditional harassment position only because it 
cannot concede that Cuba has achieved a social, economic, and 
political program such as the one it has currently, despite U.S. 
hostility. 
  Because of all this, he pointed out: "We have not come here 
on the defensive and we do not feel as though we are spiritually 
or mentally sitting on the accused bench" and our actions are 
reflected in the overall CDH program, within which at least 10 
projects have been promoted or negotiated. 
  Perez Novoa emphasized that Cuba has expressed and 
reiterated 
historically its willingness to discuss its differences with the 
United States on equal sovereign conditions and without any 
strings attached, but they are the ones that deny this offer and 
reject having normal relations and discussing differences. 
  He asserted: "An example that obstinacy remains is this 
false and manipulative human rights policy, and this is why they 
seek a new resolution." 
  Perez Novoa explained that despite U.S. pressures, Cuba 
maintains a wide, open, and transparent cooperation with the 
human rights system and rapporteurs. 
  In this regard, he mentioned how, encouraged and subsidized 
by the United States, the rapporteurs receive complaints, which 
are sometimes presented to the government without any proof or 
legality. The government, in turn, has answered them without any 
doubt or fear because we have nothing to hide. 
  He added that such cooperation is valid for all countries 
without any discrimination, selectivity, or political 
imposition. He indicated that Cuba is willing to cooperate, has 
done it, is doing it, and will continue doing it. 
  Perez Novoa mentioned the time in 1988 when Cuba invited a 
CDH delegation for a visit, and met with whoever it pleased, 
made a report, which in 1989 was presented and discussed 
publicly with the media, nongovernmental organizations, and 
observers during three sessions. 
  He stated that the report was analyzed as no other has been 
in the current CDH session, and no evidence was found to justify 
that Cuba was assigned a rapporteur. 
  Perez Novoa argued that the only thing Cubans have always 
rejected and will reject in their history is that something is 
imposed upon them. He stressed that Cubans are an open, warm, 
affectionate, compassionate people, but they will never accept 
those who seek to impose their power upon them.

<F P=106> [By PRENSA LATINA correspondent Mary Simon] </F>
  [Text] Geneva [no date or agency attribution as received] 
-- Jose Perez Novoa, Cuban ambassador to the Human Rights 
Commission (CDH), stated that this nation rejects the imposition 
of a rapporteur appointed as a result U.S. pressure or attempts 
to impose any type of alternatives. 
  With respect to this issue, the head of the Cuban delegation 
participating in the 50th session of the CDH described the 
appointment of the aforementioned rapporteur as part of 
Washington's hostile and unmerciful policy toward his country. 
  In an interview granted to PRENSA LATINA [PL], Perez Novoa 
stressed that at a time when the end of the so-called Cold War 
is being used as an instrument to demand an end to hostilities 
in regions such as Palestine and South Africa, as well as 
between bloc relations, ironically, that same policy is still 
being used and reinforced against Cuba. 
  To the diplomat, it is unacceptable to discuss an anti-Cuban 
resolution promoted by the United States such as the one 
scheduled to be voted on next week when the CDH is expected to 
end its current session. 
  In this respect, Perez Novoa indicated that "we did not come 
here on the defensive, nor did we arrive and feel that we are on 
the defendant's seat." 
  This is why Cuba's participation is directed toward the 
overall context of the CDH programs which has encouraged and 
negotiated dozens of projects, some of which were approved 
already during the CDH's second voting round on Friday, 24 
February [date as received]. 
  Moreover, the Cuban delegation's participation is taking 
place in an integral, multivalent, and comprehensive manner, 
completely divorced from any perception of isolation toward 
Havana. 
  In this respect, Perez Novoa stated that they are not 
concerned or apprehensive about the ghost of an alleged 
resolution against Cuba. In nothing -- he insisted -- does this 
cause us to lose sleep. 
  The proposal for a special rapporteur came about as a result 
of a U.S. imposition in its vendetta against Cuba. During the 
presentation of the report to the general assembly, [CDH 
rapporteur] Carl Johan Goth pointed out that in Cuba there are 
no missing persons, torture, murders, or armed groups. 
  Later on -- Perez Novoa stated -- he tried to justify an 
institutional system, but what is very clear to him is that "in 
Cuba there is no indication of massive and flagrant human rights 
violations." 
  That is obvious, insisted the ambassador, who believes that 
the real source of this resolution is the hostile and aggressive 
policy of U.S. Administrations against Cuba. 
  In this respect, Perez Novoa regretted that the new 
administration still clings to such a position which has no 
basis whatsoever. 
  That is why Cuba maintains its rightful position with 
respect 
to there being no reason for selective and discriminatory 
treatment by this CDH, nothing to justify the existence of the 
rapporteur or it being included as item 12 of the agenda. 
  Nothing of the sort -- he stated -- corresponds to the true 
situation in Cuba or what its people are experiencing. 
  "They simply cannot acknowledge that Cuba has been able to 
accomplish a social, economic, and political program such as the 
one it has despite hostilities from the United States," Perez 
Novoa indicated. 
  When correlating Washington's position with respect to the 
so-called Cold War, the ambassador indicated that while the new 
administration calls for an end to the Cold War and to 
confrontation in Palestine and South Africa, as well as in 
relations between blocs, it continues and reinforces its policy 
toward Cuba. 
  How can they explain to the world that they continue this 
Cold War policy and harass our small country, the ambassador 
asked, when Cuba does not constitute any danger whatsoever to 
the United States. Today -- he indicated -- they cannot even 
resort to the false but much used argument that we are "a Soviet 
base" because the Soviet Union as such no longer exists. 
  Perez Novoa insisted that Cuba has historically maintained, 
is, and will always be willing to discuss its differences with 
the United States under an equal condition of sovereignty and 
without any preconditions. 
  The ambassador asserted they are the ones who do not want 
to accept and evade the responsibility of having normal 
relations and discussing differences. 
  "An example that obstinacy remains is this false and 
manipulative human rights policy, and this is why they seek a 
new resolution," he said. 
<H5>  Cuban Cooperation With the CDH </H5>
  Jose Perez Novoa recounted what he called Cuba's broad, 
frank, and transparent cooperation with the entire human rights 
system and rapporteurs throughout the years. 
  In this regard, he described how, encouraged and subsidized 
by the United States, the rapporteurs receive complaints, which 
are sometimes presented without any evidence, legality, or 
force. Nevertheless, he said, the rapporteurs received the 
complaints and sent them to the government. The government, in 
turn, answered them without any doubt or fear because we have 
nothing to hide, he said. 
  On the contrary, the ambassador said, we feel proud of the 
human rights situation prevailing in Cuba as few nations have 
been able to accomplish what we have in this respect. 
  He added that cooperation is valid for all countries without 
discrimination, selectivity, or political imposition. Perez 
Novoa observed: Cuba is willing to cooperate, has done so, is 
doing so, and will continue to do so. 
  On this subject, he mentioned the time in 1988 when Cuba 
invited a CDH delegation for a visit. The CDH representatives 
visited the island, met with all those they wanted to see and 
made a report. The report was presented the following year and 
discussed publicly with the media, nongovernment organizations, 
and observer governments during three sessions. 
  Perez Novoa said the report was discussed as no other in the 
CDH session and no evidence was found to justify that Cuba be 
assigned a rapporteur. 
  What's more, he said, when the issue was taken to a vote, 
they [the United States] lost. The ambassador then referred to 
the phase after the debate, when Cuba negotiated its desire to 
continue cooperative relations with the [UN] secretary general 
with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Countries 
(Grulac) [Grupo de Paises Latinoamericanos y del Caribe] and the 
EEC. [sentence as received] 
  Cuba, he said, was not included on the agenda, had not been 
assigned a rapporteur as the United States lost that vote 
(1989), and -- as was accepted by then UN Secretary General 
Javier Perez de Cuellar -- the island maintained smooth and 
transparent cooperative relations. 
  Not satisfied with the situation, Washington asked for a 
report from the secretary general in 1990, who presented it and 
had it analyzed. 
  The fact that Cuba had maintained permanent and stable 
cooperation with the [UN] secretary general was obviously 
established in the negotiations with Grulac and the EEC. 
  As it did not further [U.S.] propaganda goals to say Havana 
had been registered as a human rights case because it was under 
topic 12 or had a rapporteur, it took advantage of the changes 
in the correlation of international forces. At the time, the 
disintegration of the Socialist field had already begun. This 
situation was used by the United States to impose an amendment 
to the resolution presented by Grulac, which was signed by 
approximately 20 representatives. 
  The only thing our people have always objected to in their 
history and will continue to object to is when something is 
imposed upon them, he asserted. Our people are open, warm, 
affectionate, and compassionate, but we will never accept those 
who try to impose their power upon us, the ambassador stressed. 
  Regarding the changes [in Cuba], as they are usually called, 
they are the ones born from our own national identity, the ones 
needed by our country and, based on this, the ones being 
implemented because they are not meant to satisfy the world, he 
said. 
  The diplomat was clear when he said: "We will not turn our 
backs on the world. We know there have been changes. However, 
we also know we have to protect the great social, economic, and 
political accomplishments of the revolution, which is the 
essence of the Cuban program. [no ending quotation mark as 
received] 
  To further this objective, he manifested, we are obliged to 
make adjustments in the country -- including economic ones -- to 
secure those achievements as much as possible. What we are not 
ready to do, under any circumstances, pressure, or even under 
the threat of weapons, is to surrender our independence and 
sovereignty, he stressed.

<F P=106> [By Carlos Fazio] </F>
  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- A method used by the 
United States over and over again is to make use accustomed to 
de facto situations. A typical and current example is the 
"Strong Roads 94" operation throughout Latin America. Using the 
excuse of building schools and rural roads, the Pentagon is 
filling the region with soldiers. The goal is to get our people 
accustomed to the U.S. military presence in the area in order to 
transform local armies into police forces under Washington's 
centralized command. 
  A subject that was once in vogue had the same fate: human 
rights. During the James Carter administration (1977-1981), the 
United States started to use the human rights issue as a foreign 
policy instrument. It did this by using a large-scale apparatus 
of propaganda and reiterations. Since then and every year, the 
occupant of the Oval Office, acting as a self-imposed judge, 
jury, and executioner, drafts reports on the observance of such 
principles in the world, issues "certifications," and punishes 
transgressors by withholding economic or military aid. 
  This policy, however, has a weak side. In all cases, the 
human rights arena exists abroad. That is, they do not apply to 
the United States. That is the getting-accustomed 
[acostumbramiento] part. 
  Given that the reality differs from the situation reported 
by 
the hypocritical media, which is subordinate to the "rumor 
mills" of the State Department and Pentagon, issues like human 
rights have become real boomerangs that have hurt the apostles 
of the White House. 
  This is so because men such as Noam Chomsky, inside the 
empire, and Gregorio Selser, in Latin America, for years, have 
denounced the double standard of this scrutinizing and 
horrifying policy that locates the bad, the ugly, and the dirty 
living abroad and describes them as outlaws who deserve to be 
condemned. 
  This comes to light because the Autonomous University of 
Sinoloa, in Mexico, is presenting a reedited book by Selser (who 
passed away) entitled The Violation of Human Rights in the 
United States [La Violacion de los Derechos Humanos en Estados 
Unidos]. 
  The first edition, which mysteriously vanished, dates back 
to 
1989. It is, however, completely valid today. 
  Many 1989 human rights violators have intensified their 
actions in the United States today. 
  Groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, Moral Majority, Unification 
Church, Aryan White Resistance, among others, which were 
denounced by Selser in his book, continue to show no mercy to 
Blacks, Hispanics, and American Jews. 
  Police violence against minorities, which was brought to the 
fore in 1991 with the Rodney King case -- a colored man who was 
brutally beaten by four white policemen -- was repeated in the 
case of Lorenzo Colston, a black man who was shot in the butt on 
29 September 1993 with a Magnum 357 by a white policeman, who 
was just acquitted. Paradoxically, Colston could be sentenced to 
28 years in prison for attacking this policeman. 
  Selser's work summarizes the lengthy chain of 
discrimination, 
persecution, hostility against minorities, and ethnic conflicts 
-- now they are in vogue in Chiapas, the Venezuelan Perija 
mountain range, the Ecuadoran high plateau, and the Brazilian 
Amazon region -- like those of the Mohawk Indians in the Sain 
Regis-Akewasasne Reserve along both sides of the U.S.-Canadian 
border. 
  There is no doubt that if Don Gregorio were alive today, he 
would be reporting on Washington's flagrant violation of Article 
14 of the Human Rights Declaration that reads: "In case of 
persecution, every person has the right to request asylum and 
enjoy it in any country." The Haitians, for example, are locked 
up in a prison of terror by a U.S. blockade under the UN 
umbrella. Even the "boat people" who manage to escape the island 
are detained on the high seas by U.S. marines and turned back to 
the Raoul Cedras regime. 
  This policy of summary interdiction and repatriation is not 
only racist but also exposes the cynicism of Washington's 
so-called "humanitarian policy." 
  The participation of expert John Saxe Fernandez in the 
presentation of Selser's book, besides being a homage deserved 
by the master, will give us a closer look at this situation. In 
recent times, a favorite target of this situation have been 
Mexicans who aspire to work in the mecca of capitalism. Walls, 
ditches, and sensors are part of the new humanitarian methods 
used by border patrols against those trying to win freedom.

  [Text] Havana, 2 Mar (PL) -- Regarding the Nation and 
Immigration meeting which will be held in Havana, Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina affirmed that those who will come to 
Havana are those who respect us and do not ask for our heads. 
  Robaina reiterated that 200 emigrants living in 17 countries 
will attend the meeting, scheduled for 22-24 April. 
  While speaking at a Higher Education Ministry seminar, 
Robaina said not all the existing sectors will come to the 
meeting, and not all the topics will be covered, but regarding 
the organization, there will be a breadth that may surprise many. 
  The minister reiterated the nonattendance of those he termed 
hysterical, when he referred to the fact that critics had laid 
wagers the meeting would not be held, and he added, now they say 
only our friends have been invited. 
  Robaina pointed out that among the topics on the agenda, in 
order of importance, are matters that concern the Cuban 
community, and he announced the creation of a system in the 
ministry for dealing with the emigres. 
  He admitted that for many years in Cuba the topic of 
immigration was very politicized, and said that recently, 
departures from the country have increased due to economic and 
family problems. 
  He pointed out that the most recalcitrant of the immigration 
sectors have announced the collapse of the Cuban Government for 
35 years and that message has wearied other residents living 
abroad. 
  Referring to human rights, Robaina said that the United 
States is preparing a new offensive on the topic, which is 
debated in Geneva, and he said Cuba will not allow the entry of 
any UN rapporteur. 
  Nevertheless, Robaina added that 14 Nobel Peace prize 
winners 
are invited to tour the length and breadth of the country.

<F P=106> [By Zenaida Ferrer Martinez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 3 Mar (PL) -- Cuba is reorganizing its 
domestic and foreign economic policy to cope with the adverse 
economic and financial situation and to advance in the search 
for real development that will allow the country's reinsertion 
into the world economy. 
  Cuban Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez made the above 
statement during a conference of Higher Education Ministry 
officials, who have been meeting since last Monday with 
government and Cuban Communist Party officials. 
  Different economic mechanisms based on new laws are being 
applied, which, in addition to the changes made to the domestic 
economy such as the increase in self-employment (with nearly 
145,000 people participating since Decree 141 was passed last 
September), are a solution to the decreasing number of jobs, 
Rodriguez said. 
  Rodriguez explained that the changes (including the 
suspension of penalties for possessing dollars, opening to 
foreign capital, and other changes) could lead to a better year 
for Cuba from an economic viewpoint, especially a halt to the 
violent fall experienced between 1989 and 1993. 
  Rodriguez pointed out that the strongest of the measures 
adopted by the government in this stage is the introduction of 
agricultural cooperatives. 
  He explained that the exploitation of extensive areas of 
land 
using a large amount of imported fertilizers could not be 
continued following the collapse of the socialist bloc and the 
disappearance of the USSR (the nation's leading trading 
partners). 
  We had to make a political decision. We had to link man 
directly with his work by creating basic cooperative productive 
units, which are socialist formulas that allow peasants to feel 
like co-owners of the land. 
  We have reached the conclusion that certain unproductive 
factories cannot continue to operate, that we must review the 
payrolls, and that we must make a series of decisions to see 
that economic mechanisms are successful and that the country's 
financial situation improves. 
  The minister said all the monetary-fiscal reforms that have 
been applied and that are being studied are aimed at achieving a 
stimulating [estimulante] relationship between work and salary 
now that the country is facing the dual problem of an excess of 
national currency and foreign exchange. 
  Nevertheless, he predicted that with a change in economic 
mentality, a halt of the current crisis if not progress in the 
solution thereof should be observed in the second half of the 
year. 
  He based his optimism on the possibility of having a 
superior 
sugar harvest (or a less costly one), the increase in the price 
of sugar and nickel (and a recovery in the production of this 
mineral, which is in high international demand), the 
substitution of imports, and a significant increase in 
agriculture. 
  In this regard, he also mentioned oil exploration, restoring 
electricity to previous levels, revising storage methods for 
agricultural products, and labor reforms, which are essential to 
control a relative or absolute labor force surplus. 
  He said that Cuba has not abandoned its full employment 
policy, but to avoid identifying it with labor idleness, 
alternatives for state, cooperative, or self-employment work 
have been opened, accompanied by strict order and discipline. 
  Rodriguez said Cuba's degree of economic opening to the 
outside will always be high, with tourism as the basic program, 
followed by the export of nontraditional products, the export of 
established products like sugar, nickel, and tobacco, and with 
expeditious changes to reincorporate the country into the world 
economy. 
  Rodriguez said the country will remain open to foreign 
capital and stated that 129 associations with this type of 
financing are currently operating in Cuba. 
  He said that the most serious obstacle in the way of this 
program is the embargo that the United States has been applying 
to the country for more than three decades. To this must be 
added the country's foreign debt, which equals approximately $7 
billion. 
  There are solutions, but they are extremely complex, 
Rodriguez concluded.

  [Text] Havana, 4 Mar (PL) -- Osvaldo Martinez, the 
president of the Parliament's economic commission, anticipates 
that the Cuban economy will improve during the second half of 
1994 because of the influence of structural changes in the 
agricultural sector and the positive reaction by some sectors. 
  According to a Radio Rebelde report, Martinez, who is also 
the director of the World Economy Research Center, argued in a 
conference with journalists and students at Havana University 
that the worst was left behind in 1993 and predicted that the 
second half of 1994 will show improvement. 
  Martinez stated that the improvement will become evident 
through a stop in the fall of economic indicators, a trend that 
arose following the collapse of the European Socialist Bloc and 
the Soviet Union between 1989 and 1991, as well as through 
modest increases in some strategic sectors. 
  Martinez added that the consolidation of the Basic 
Cooperative Production Units [UBPC] with slight increases in 
food production and a significant reduction in costs will begin 
to exert a positive influence and so will the financial 
reorganization measures that will be implemented this year. 
  The UBPC operate on state property and are exploited by 
groups of workers who employ production means that were bought 
from the former agricultural-livestock enterprises. The UBPC's 
purpose is based on profitability and economic efficiency. 
  Martinez clarified that the sugar harvest and nickel 
production, whose international prices are starting to pick up, 
will constitute major sources of foreign currency as well as 
modest increases in the sale of pharmaceuticals. 
  Martinez said that the tourism industry, which has 
experienced a steady growth, plays a pivotal role in this 
process and added that this industry is expected to receive 1 
million visitors in 1994 and earn $350 million in net profits. 
  Martinez concluded that these positive factors lead him to 
predict that the national economy will perform better as of the 
second half of 1994.

  [Text] Major General Ulises Rosales del Toro, first vice 
minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR), said today 
this corps is in optimum condition to fulfill its mission due to 
its high cohesion and combative readiness. 
  In a meeting with journalists on the occasion of Cuban Press 
Day, which will be held on 14 March, Rosales del Toro said that 
the FAR are in their best stage of development, according to a 
National Information Agency report. 
  The General Staff chief argued the Armed Forces have a 
commander in chief, Fidel Castro, who is capable enough to 
continue leading the revolution, a minister, Raul Castro, who 
has much experience, and a corps of officers forged by 
revolutionary struggles. 
  Regarding the education of the new generations, the general 
cited journalists' role. Rosales del Toro, also a member of the 
Communist Party of Cuba Politburo, said the press must fight 
every formality and work for the defense of the country.

  [Text] Mexico City, 7 Mar (PL) -- After five days of peace 
talks here, the Guatemalan Government and the guerrillas have 
achieved "certain progress" for possible immediate international 
verification of the violation of human rights during the 
internal armed conflict. 
  One rebel negotiator assured PRENSA LATINA that supervision 
of violations of citizens' liberties is the sole issue making 
true progress since the current round of talks began on Thursday. 
  The source requested anonymity out of respect for the 
participants' commitment with the United Nations not to disclose 
any information to the media during the talks. Nevertheless, he 
let it slip that "tomorrow there will surely be a joint 
statement on this issue." 
  Immediate international verification, however, is only one 
of 
three issues included in the human rights issue. This in turn 
is one of the two points on the negotiating agenda together with 
the setting of a general timetable for the process. 
  So, in five days of alternate encounters by the participants 
(pendular system) with UN moderator French Jean Arnault, neither 
the creation of an investigation commission on the violations 
nor the possibility of an alleged agreement in this regard has 
been taken up. 
  The two sides have not met face to face, only communicating 
separately with the mediator. Nevertheless, each delegation 
separately admitted "progress" and even Hector Rosada, chief of 
the government delegation, talked about "75 percent progress." 
  Arnault accepted there are differences and decided to 
postpone until tomorrow the encounter that should have concluded 
today, as the extension of his consultation with the warring 
factions warranted the need to engage in one more day of 
conversations. 
  The UN official did not consider important the fact that the 
government and the guerrillas had not met together after five 
days of talks. "This does not mean incomprehension; it is only 
a technical detail," he indicated. 
  Arnault also indicated that the main stumbling block in 
outlining international verification is centered on the manner 
in which it is to be implemented. That is, is the verification 
done "in the middle of the war or after the cease-fire," he 
explained. 
  On this, there are recent precedents in Central America 
where 
the United Nations initiated investigations of the violation of 
human rights in El Salvador after the signing of the armistice 
in January 1992 between the government and the Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front. 
  Therefore, according to analysts, in no way do the end of 
war 
actions have to necessarily be a condition to start clearing up 
murders, extrajudicial executions, kidnappings, and other 
matters in Guatemala. 
  A document distributed here by the Guatemalan human rights 
organizations indicates that from June 1993 to February 1994 
there were 43 massacres, 282 murders, 45 persons declared 
missing after being arrested, 1,469 arbitrary detentions, and 
210 death threats registered in Guatemala. In addition, 19 
children were reported missing and 17 infants were found dead, 
according to the Guatemalan human rights commission. 
  Last week, the UN Human Rights Commission that meets in 
Geneva, Switzerland, decided to continue its advisory on 
Guatemala regarding citizens rights and urged the warring 
factions to sign an immediate international verification 
agreement on this issue. 
  In this regard, Arnault commented, "it is clear that the UN 
orientation fostered the parties' desire to sign an agreement."

<F P=106> [Interview with Daniel Ortega, Sandinist National Liberation </F>
Front, FSLN, Secretary General, by Maite Rico in Madrid; date 
not given; first paragraph is EL PAIS introduction] 
  [Text] Madrid--Daniel Ortega, 49, is dressed in severe 
black, an austerity broken only by a crimson scarf. The 
commander appears to have retired those thick glasses that used 
to cover his oriental eyes. He arrived in Spain last week on an 
invitation from the University of Castellon, and he has taken 
the opportunity to meet with Spanish Foreign Minister Javier 
Solana and various opposition leaders. 
  [Rico] In the past year, Nicaragua has undergone an 
escalation of actions by armed groups leading to political 
tensions. Is the country becoming polarized again? 
  [Ortega] Politically speaking, despite the confrontations, 
the polarization that led to the war has gradually subsided. 
There is better understanding than there has been in years. 
Nevertheless, we are going through a period of radicalization as 
a result of the economic policy, unemployment (we have a 60 
percent jobless rate), poverty, pressure on the productive 
sectors.... In the past four years, the neoliberalism of Violeta 
Chamorro's government has aggravated the recession. 
  [Rico] What alternatives does the Sandinist National 
Liberation Front (FSLN) propose? 
  [Ortega] We would have to begin with a national gathering of 
all political, business, and labor organizations at which the 
government would present the preliminary agreements it has 
entered into with the World Bank and the International Monetary 
Fund, so that the various sectors can express their opinions. 
What is being negotiated with these agencies are structural 
adjustments that will be binding on the country in future years. 
  [Rico] The honeymoon between the Chamorro government and the 
Sandinist Front has been eclipsed in recent months. Has the 
"cohabitation" arrangement that emerged after the 1990 elections 
been abandoned? 
  [Ortega] The situation has not been so linear; there have 
been ups and downs. The Sandinist Front has engaged in an 
opposition of constructive criticism, of coming down hard on the 
government when it proposes destabilizing measures and 
supporting it when we agree with its proposals. Right now, for 
example, we agree on the need to make common cause vis-a-vis the 
international organizations and on promoting constitutional 
reforms. 
  [Rico] Yet Violeta Chamorro has accused you of destabilizing 
the country: She has even said that you went through a 
"psychosis" because you could not accept your electoral defeat. 
  [Ortega] (Ortega smiles.) She said I was crazy. And she has 
said that several times. You have to understand that Mrs. 
Chamorro is not involved in the internal affairs of the country. 
She is a symbolic figure, the widow of Pedro Joaquin. It is the 
members of her cabinet who are in charge, and they are in the 
best position to assess what we Sandinists have done. We have 
cooperated when they have not asked us to. 
  [Rico] The game of alliances among political groups in 
Nicaragua has evolved since 1990: The pact between the 
Sandinists and the government has given rise to recent contacts 
between you and the National Opposition Union (UNO), leaving the 
government out. Everyone talks of the need for a general accord 
for the good of the country, but in fact it looks more like a 
dance for the distribution of power. 
  [Ortega] You have to look at the results. We have in fact 
been in contact with the UNO, not secretly, but in the open. And 
in November we began discussing constitutional reform with them. 
That step laid the groundwork for UNO deputies to rejoin the 
National Assembly. The results have been positive. 
  [Rico] Some groups of former combatants (Sandinists and 
Contras) are still active. Has the policy of reintegration 
failed? 
  [Ortega] These outbreaks are linked to the economic-social 
crisis. These people are ex-soldiers and demoralized peasants. 
The government signed agreements with them for land grants and 
aid, and it has reneged. The only way to solve this problem is 
to fulfill these commitments. 
  [Rico] One of the issues that has raised the most hackles in 
your country is the government's desire to remove the Army from 
the Sandinist orbit, which entails forcing your brother, General 
Humberto Ortega, to step down as defense minister. 
  [Ortega] That is a matter that has already reached the point 
of inflection, because we are pushing it through legislative 
channels so that it will not be influenced by external pressure. 
A bill to amend the law on the Army has already been sent to the 
executive branch, which will determine the time frame for 
changes in the Armed Forces. I estimate they will begin early 
next year. 
  [Rico] Will they accept this law? 
  [Ortega] Yes. No one denies that the comrades who are in the 
Army and the police are Sandinist comrades and revolutionaries, 
but they subordinate their actions to the Constitution and the 
government. 
  [Rico] Nicaragua will hold elections in 1996. Could Somozism 
reemerge as positions become radicalized? 
  [Ortega] The Somozists in fact already have something going 
in the form of the Constitutionalist Liberal Party, led by 
Arnaldo Guzman, which is very powerful. The Somozists were in 
power for more than 40 years; they established a social base and 
grew out of a historic party, the Liberal Party. And now they 
are reemerging under the banner of liberalism. They are 
Sandinism's principal adversaries. That is why we feel we must 
promote a very broad policy of alliances, a program of national 
unity. 
  [Rico] Would this alliance include the moderate sectors of 
the UNO? 
  [Ortega] Yes. It would include all sectors who are willing 
to 
strengthen the continuity of the revolutionary program, with the 
necessary adjustments, but always with a view to democratizing 
the country. 
  [Rico] Given what has happened over the last four years, is 
a 
pact of this nature possible when the presidency of the country 
is up for grabs? 
  [Ortega] Nicaragua has to come first, and any personal 
interests have to come second, or last. 
  [Rico] Is that possible, then? 
  [Ortega] Sure it is possible.

  [Text] Today lawyer Jaime Jose Bestard, acting on behalf of 
the Colorado Reconciliation Movement, a faction of the Colorado 
Party, submitted to the Supreme Court a great number of 
documents on the Colorado Party elections, which were held on 27 
December 1992. These documents could allegedly prove that the 
current administration of President Juan Carlos Wasmosy is 
illegitimate. Luis Maria Argana, the leader of the faction, also 
was present at the Supreme Court when the presentation was made. 
  The Supreme Court received five thick binders which contain 
5,000 notarized photocopies of electoral records from the 
capital, Concepcion, San Pedro, Cordillera, Guaira, Caaguazu, 
Caazapa, Itaugua, Itapua, Misiones, Paraguari and Alto Parana. 
The records bear the signatures of the presidents, vice 
presidents, and faction representatives of each voting station. 
  The plea states: "These documents clearly show the true 
results of the Colorado Party elections held on 27 December 
1992." 
  According to the plea, the total vote count yields the 
following result: Ticket No. 4 [Argana] 215,764 votes; Ticket 
No. 2 [Wasmosy] 188,949 votes, which means that the Colorado 
Reconciliation Movement won the elections by 26,815. 
  It is explained that only the vote counts for presidential 
and vice presidential candidates are being objected to as 
unconstitutional, not the vote count for senators and deputies. 
  The plea emphasizes that "it is aimed at laying bare this 
monstrous fraud and paving the way for the appropriate criminal 
lawsuit and claims for damages against the people involved."

  [Text] Caracas, 7 Mar (DPA) -- Chinese Vice Foreign 
Minister Liu Huaqui said here today that China places great 
importance on strengthening its relations with developing 
countries such as Venezuela. Liu Huaqui is on an official visit 
to Caracas and will travel to Santiago de Chile tomorrow. 
  Our country advocates an independent peace policy as a basis 
for its foreign policy, the ranking diplomat of the People's 
Republic of China stated, reiterating that these objectives will 
be strengthened in its ties with Venezuela. 
  Relations between Beijing and Caracas will be boosted soon 
with "high-level visits" and increased bilateral economic 
cooperation. 
  After meeting with Roy Chaderton, his Venezuelan 
counterpart, 
and establishing the political Chinese-Venezuelan consultation 
mechanisms, Liu plans to meet with President Rafael Caldera and 
Foreign Minister Miguel Burelli Rivas. He will also preside 
over the installation of a binational trade commission. 
  Trade between the two countries was close to $100 million in 
1993; the main products traded were iron, chemicals, textiles, 
and home electrical appliances, according to figures from the 
Chinese Embassy in Caracas. According to the same source, 
China increased its imports from Venezuela by 200 percent last 
year.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Carlos Menem by Jose Olmo y Losada </F>
in Buenos Aires; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Olmo] Are you concerned 
about the image of yourself and your government which may exist 
in Spain? 
  [Menem] I do not know what image of myself or my government 
may exist in Spain, but I believe that Argentina has become a 
center of attraction internationally. It is one of the 
countries with the highest growth rates in the world, in third 
place after China and Thailand, and, with respect to the Western 
world, one of the most developed of the past few years. 
Investments are still coming in, and there is a very good level 
of wages. The highest wages in the Americas (if we leave out 
the United States) are paid in the Argentine Republic. Poverty 
has fallen spectacularly, to such an extent that from 30 percent 
structural poverty in 1989 we are now at 12 percent. And 
marginal poverty, which is hardship, has fallen from 10 percent 
in 1989, when I took office, to 2 percent at present. Stability 
persists, and inflation, if we measure it from January of last 
year to January 1994, does not exceed 6.5 percent. According to 
the budget forecasts, inflation will not exceed 4.5 percent this 
year. There is peace; there is calm. I do not know what image 
people in Spain may have of Argentina and my government, and 
whether this is due to the dishonesty of some section of my 
country's news media, which may have influenced Spain, but the 
impression which we have is that Argentina's image in the world 
is excellent. 
<H5>  Personal Image </H5>
  [Olmo] Do you believe that there is some anti-Menemist lobby 
in Spain which obstructs Spanish-Argentine relations? 
  [Menem] I have no knowledge of this, but it could be so. If 
we are speaking of anti-Menemism, we would have to speak of 
anti-Argenitinism. This government represents Argentina, is the 
government elected by the people, and I can see no reason why 
this kind of situation should exist. It may exist, but this 
does not harm in the slightest the image of Argentina or its 
government -- one of the most progressive in the world. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Olmo] Is there subversion in Argentina? Could another 
Chiapas happen here? 
  [Menem] There is no subversion in Argentina. Some kind of 
tinge of subversion has occurred -- the case of Santiago del 
Estero -- but measures have been adopted and this is under 
investigation. But there is no subversion in the Argentine 
Republic; it does not exist, and it is absolutely impossible for 
what happened in Chiapas to happen here. The Mexican Government 
itself has acknowledged the extreme poverty in which those 
communities in Chiapas are living, but, moreover, there is an 
ethnic problem and a religious problem there; something that is 
not the case in Argentina. There is no possibility of 
subversion here. What happened in Santiago del Estero was 
caused by some kind of infiltration, and this explains the 
remarks of Daniel Ortega -- the Sandinist leader -- in Cuba a 
few days ago, in which he justified armed struggle and gave 
Chiapas and Santiago del Estero as examples. What happened in 
Santiago del Estero was facilitated by the terrible political 
administration. The province's leaders were not paying wages, or 
those of the highest ranking officials were increased unduly, 
leaving those of the other public employees very low. But the 
situation has now been completely restored to normal, and if you 
look at a scale of the wages earned by Argentine teachers, you 
will be able to ascertain that those of Santiago del Estero are 
now the highest in the country. 
  [Olmo] Why is nothing as yet known of the alleged 
activists who caused the incidents in Santiago del Estero? 
  [Menem] This is being investigated, and Daniel Ortega's 
statements exempt me from making any comment. If Daniel Ortega 
gives Santiago del Estero as an example, it is because there 
were people there who were brought in by these elements; death 
traffickers, because subversion is death trafficking. What they 
cannot achieve within the framework of democracy they are trying 
to impose by force. You cannot justify armed struggle like that 
for no particular reason. Clearly, there were people of this 
kind, infiltrated into the uprising, in Chiapas, too. 
<H5>  Conflict with Chile </H5>
  [Olmo] Chilean flags have been burned in Argentina and 
Argentine flags in Chile. The cause is the territorial dispute 
over Laguna del Desierto. Will this tension between the two 
countries ever cease? 
  [Menem] This matter of the Chilean flags burned in Argentina 
was a result of some trade union leaders' irrationality and 
uncouthness, but in any event those same leaders later expressed 
their regret at what happened with an apology to the Chilean 
people. We deem this matter closed. We regard the burning of 
the Argentine flags as an act of retaliation for what happened 
here. The burning of neither flag is justified in any way. We 
have resolved 22 out of the 24 border problems which we had with 
Chile through our doing -- President Aylwin's and my own. The 
border problem of Laguna del Desierto is under international 
arbitration, and we are quite confident that the court's ruling 
will favor Argentina's aim that matters should remain as they 
have stood since the 1902 treaty. It is Argentine territory, 
occupied by Argentinians, and recognized as such by Chile until 
1958, when it adopted another stance. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Ernesto Samper and Andres Pastrana are tied in their 
bid for the Presidency of the Republic. According to the latest 
poll by the National Consulting Center, the two candidates, who 
lead the surveys, are still neck and neck for the first and 
second round of elections. 
  Samper and Pastrana are advancing neck and neck in their 
quest for the Presidency. For the first time in history, no 
bets can be made for either candidate in the electoral process. 
The polls have revealed such a small difference that it can be 
said technically they are tied. 
  Figures speak for themselves. For the first electoral round 
Samper obtained 38 percent of the support over 37 percent for 
Pastrana; forty-five percent of those polled in the second round 
have said they would vote for Andres Pastrana and 44 percent for 
Ernesto Samper. 
  Regardless of from where it comes, the opinion sector or the 
campaign team, the fact of the matter is in May each vote will 
be decisive. There are eight weeks before the election, 
however, and the result of the consultation within the Liberal 
Party and the reallocation of forces after the legislative 
elections can change things substantially.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 7 Mar (EFE) -- Conservative 
presidential hopeful Andres Pastrana today criticized the 
government's decision to establish commercial relations with 
Cuba without first demanding a pronouncement by Cuban President 
Fidel Castro condemning the Colombian guerrillas. 
  Pastrana noted that Castro has not made any pledges to 
Colombia, and he added that in order to strengthen commercial 
relations, which were interrupted more than a decade ago because 
of Cuban support for the Colombian guerrillas, the Cuban leader 
must clarify his relationship with the guerrillas. 
  The presidential hopeful recalled that the top leader of the 
Army of National Liberation -- the former Spanish priest Manuel 
Perez -- has repeatedly said his movement is Cuba's mouthpiece 
in Colombia, and this, in turn, requires that Castro make a 
statement. Speaking in the town of Rioacha, Guajira, Pastrana 
said the resumption of commercial relations harms Colombia more 
than it benefits Cuba. 
  "As everybody knows, a boycott of Colombian products in the 
United States has been announced," the conservative hopeful 
indicated. 
  Last week, after the Colombian Government announced it will 
sell 20,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba, the decision prompted 
a strong reaction among Cuban exiles in Miami, who have launched 
a campaign in the United States against the purchase of 
Colombian products.

  [Text] It has been reported that 100,000 Armed Forces 
members will implement the Democracy Plan, which seeks to ensure 
that the country's coming electoral activities will be held 
normally and peacefully. Administrative Department of Security 
[DAS] members will also participate in the plan, which has been 
coordinated by the Defense Ministry. 
  The Democracy Plan consists of three main facets: security 
of 
candidates, security at the voting sites, and security of 
National Civil Registry Office members, not only during the 
elections but during the vote counting and the transportation of 
ballot boxes as well. 
  General Celso Suarez, the Armed Forces General Command's 
chief of operations, has told EL TIEMPO: "In most of the cases, 
the police will protect the ballot boxes, and the Navy and the 
Air Force will be in charge of protecting the general area 
surrounding the voting sites." 
  Although no area in the country will be left unprotected, 
there will be priorities, according to the Defense Ministry. In 
the Uraba zone in Antioquia and Choco Departments alone, 8,000 
Armed Forces members will guarantee normalcy before, during, and 
after the elections, Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda has 
reported. Pardo visited the area this week with high-ranking 
Army and police officers and registry official Luis Camilo 
Osorio. 
  EL TIEMPO has learned that the Armed Forces have decided to 
give special attention to the Santander, Boyaca, Cesar, 
Magdalena, and Meta Departments. The strategy adopted by the 
police and DAS establishes protection of the candidates, 
political centers, patrolling, and making available bomb squads 
and investigation squads. 
  The candidates' protection includes making sure the 
candidates for president follow the instructions issued by their 
security chiefs and escorts. In theory, all candidates to 
public positions can have official escorts. The large number of 
candidates makes this difficult, however. For the time being, 
the Defense Ministry is trying to establish who really requires 
protection and determine priorities in the movement of escorts. 
  Suarez said: "The Public Force has offered the highest 
security possible to those who request it. We must mention that 
we are inviting all candidates to regional and municipal 
security committees to present their concerns and needs." 
  The high-level official confirmed consultations with the 
candidates had facilitated the study in each case to recommend 
the respective security measures. He also admitted that the 
military forces are analyzing the possibility of candidates' 
avoiding travel in certain areas of the nation with public order 
problems. 
  When making reference to this week's attacks and kidnappings 
as part of the guerrillas' plan to hamper the electoral process, 
Suarez said that even though kidnapping and murder have become a 
profession for the rebels, neither the citizens nor the 
political class have been intimidated. 
  He also responded to criticism according to which the 
Democratic Plan is only a transitory reaction that does not 
solve the true problem of the rebels. The officer said that the 
plan is not new. Nevertheless, he added, it goes without saying 
that "any person or group that tries to alter or hamper the 
normal development of the elections will be the object of a 
timely reaction by the Public Forces." 
  According to military sources, the deployment of personnel 
to 
implement the Democratic Plan should not in any way hamper the 
development of offensive operations against the guerrillas 
throughout the nation. "It is important to highlight that this 
plan will be implemented without impairing the counterinsurgency 
offensive. Currently we have the capability to handle both 
fronts appropriately," Suarez noted.

  [Text] A prosecutor obtains an arrest warrant against a 
mayor upon finding a 15,000-peso discrepancy in an account, and 
another charges a widow with homicide solely because she did not 
attend her husband's funeral. 
  A special prosecutor demands money from the potential 
targets 
of his investigation, and others do not attend court proceedings 
and later allow court orders to be falsified. 
  Investigations and arrests are overturned because of 
inconsistencies, as in Adelina Mesa's case, who was accused of a 
terrorist attack in Bogota, and prosecutors are blamed for 
inconsistencies in a number of cases. 
  All these episodes seem to have finally exhausted the 
patience of Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta. His staff 
is now handling 1,200 investigations of prosecutors. In a letter 
to Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, he revealed the 
system's Achilles heel: arbitrary actions and negligence on the 
part of a number of prosecutors. 
  Arrieta issued a forceful criticism: some prosecutors 
initiate legal action hastily and without solid evidence, 
thereby violating the principle of [presumed] innocence and due 
process. 
  In his letter, the attorney general announced the immediate 
start of new investigations because these abuses still persist, 
even though in May 1993 he had issued warnings concerning these 
abuses, also in a letter to the prosecutor general. 
  De Greiff agrees that there are serious irregularities in 
the 
work of some of his subordinates, but says they do not reach the 
extreme cited by the Attorney General's Office. 
  "We," De Greiff told EL TIEMPO, "do not conceal anything 
from 
a sense of esprit de corps; we do not protect people because 
they are in the Prosecutor General's Office. We are not saints, 
but we try to be." 
  During his 18 months at the Prosecutor General's Office, De 
Greiff has investigated 656 prosecutors in internal procedures. 
To date 238 investigations have been concluded; 418 are still 
under way. 
<H5>  Director of Prosecution Offices </H5>
  The National Director of Prosecution Offices, Ana Montes, 
who 
coordinates prosecutors all over the country and whose office 
maintains statistics on decisions issued by prosecutors acting 
as trial judges, has her own view of the matter. 
  Montes agrees that "it is time to look at what is going on," 
but she explains that many of the complaints are filed when the 
party affected by a decision calls for a disciplinary or penal 
investigation against the prosecutor. 
  Still, the Attorney General's Office believes that the 
problem goes far beyond that. As an example, they say that 
prosecutors have been initiating legal proceedings against 
municipal officials who in the end prove their innocence. 
  "On many occasions ignorance of administrative contracting 
provisions and regulations or of budget systems has caused legal 
action to be initiated and municipal officials to be suspended 
who later (...) must be returned to office." 
  "All this," explains the attorney general, "could be avoided 
if prosecutors studied the situation thoroughly before 
initiating legal proceedings." 
  However, De Greiff and Arrieta both seem to agree that the 
time has come to apply a firm hand.

  [Text] A week before Juan David Ochoa Vasquez is to work 
out a settlement with the Prosecutor General's Office, EL TIEMPO 
obtained exclusive access to Fabio Ochoa Vasquez's confession. 
  In this confession the youngest of the Ochoa Vasquez 
brothers 
gave the Prosecutor General's Office new details on how the 
Medellin drug traffickers operated. 
  Ochoa's statement revealed routes, the modus 
operandi, drug destinations, money laundering, and their 
ties with the owners of "Tranquilandia." 
  Based on this confession, which was supported and confirmed 
by testimony from two other drug traffickers who have confessed, 
Jaime Mejia Sanin and Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasquez, and by 
statements given to U.S. Justice Department officials by Max 
Mermelstein and Carlos Lehder, the state on 20 December 1993 
sentenced Fabio Ochoa to eight and one-half years in prison, 
without reductions. 
  As an example, Mermelstein--considered one of the Medellin 
Cartel's principal contacts in the United States--said that 
between 1981 and 1983 he worked with the cartel and helped bring 
56 tons of cocaine to the United States. 
  Speaking of the youngest of the Ochoa brothers involved in 
drug trafficking, Mermelstein said he first met him in 1978 and 
received from him "a kilo of cocaine in Miami; later he [Ochoa] 
showed me another 100 kilos in an apartment." 
  He added that on a number of occasions he met with members 
of 
the Medellin Cartel--among whom he mentioned Fabio Ochoa--in 
Panama, Miami, and the capital of Antioquia, to discuss drug 
trafficking deals. He also said he had visited the 
"Tranquilandia" lab, set up by the cartel between 1983 and 1984 
in the Yari forests (Caqueta department). 
<H5>  The "Stake" System </H5>
  Fabio Ochoa confessed to being involved in drug trafficking 
for 16 years, starting in 1974 and leaving the business, he 
said, in mid-1990, when he turned himself in. 
  Ochoa's testimony, obtained exclusively by EL TIEMPO, says 
that "he primarily sold drugs, periodically exporting varying 
amounts of cocaine, which increased over time, to the United 
States." 
  According to this confessed trafficker, his first shipment 
consisted of a half kilo of drugs; over the years he sent tons 
of drugs to the United States. 
  Of these amounts, Ochoa said that only part belonged to him, 
as they were sent through a system the drug traffickers called 
"a stake," meaning that the shipment did not come from a single 
person, but from several people. 
  Although Ochoa gave details on some of the shipments, the 
Prosecutor General's Office and the special judge of Medellin, 
who endorsed the settlement between the state and this criminal, 
said that because of the passage of time and the informal and 
clandestine way in which those operations were conducted, no 
further information is available on each of the drug shipments 
in which the youngest of the Ochoa clan participated. 
  Ochoa said that in 1988 he participated "as a stake-holder 
in 
shipping cocaine to the United States." The special Medellin 
judge revealed in his sentence that the cocaine was shipped on a 
route that started in Bolivia and went through Argentina. 
  On this shipment, the document reveals that Ochoa faked the 
import of salted anchovies to New York to conceal 1,124 kilos of 
cocaine. 
  In late 1989 and early 1990, he was also involved in sending 
cocaine to Spain, but the final destination of this shipment was 
the United States. 
  The youngest of the Ochoa family, the first of the family to 
turn himself in, also confessed to the crime of conspiring to 
commit a crime, as he set up and ran a drug trafficking 
organization. 
<H5>  Failure in Darien </H5>
  He also stated that there were links with some drug 
processing labs and that he had lent approximately $250,000 to 
the owners of "Tranquilandia," possibly so they would complete 
the construction of that laboratory in the Colombian forests. 
  Ochoa added that they paid that money back with "cheaper and 
better quality merchandise." 
  In 1984, according to his confession, he again provided 
money 
to finance a large drug processing lab in the Darien region near 
the Panamanian border, but according to Ochoa, this facility 
never operated because it was discovered by the authorities. 
  According to Ochoa, on "one occasion in 1986, he rented land 
and had a runway developed near the banks of the Middle 
Magdalena River. This runway was to be used for transporting 
drugs." 
  This clandestine runway, he added, was a failure because it 
was in an area with strong guerrilla influence. 
  The drug trafficker also confessed to illicit enrichment, 
"acquiring horses, livestock, cars, and ranches." These assets 
came to an approximate total value of $2 million. "He is 
prepared to turn over the equivalent of this amount, since this 
property has been converted into other assets, both personal and 
real estate property," said the special judge in confirming the 
negotiated settlement reached between the Prosecutor General's 
Office and the accused. 
  Ochoa also confessed that he had used various persons from 
his organization in financial and commercial operations to 
launder the dollars he received from drug trafficking. These 
operations took place in Panama and in Medellin.

  [Text] Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim described as 
very positive the visit U.S. Vice President Al Gore will make to 
Brazil on 21 March, when he will be received by President Itamar 
Franco. On the night of 3 March, Amorim confirmed here to 
GAZETA that Gore will meet Franco. 
  After visiting Argentina, Gore will come immediately to 
Brazil, where he will discuss topics such as the environment, 
sustainable development, and the U.S.-Latin American summit to 
be held in Washington this year. 
  Amorim said Gore will visit Brazil in an atmosphere of 
positive bilateral relations as a result of the U.S. decision to 
refrain from imposing trade sanctions on Brazil as part of its 
quest for ensuring protection of intellectual property rights. 
Commenting on this issue -- which was resolved on 25 February, 
Amorim noted that Brazil benefited from the new framework 
created on the subject, that is, the wording of "TRIPPS" 
(Trade-Related Intellectual Property Protection System) 
negotiated under the GATT Uruguay Round. 
  Amorim also noted that Brazil has made progress in this area 
and that his willingness to go to Washington on 16 February just 
to discuss the matter with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor -- during a 90-minute meeting -- created a good 
impression in the United States. Speaking to this newspaper, 
Amorim said: "They felt that we have shown interest." Amorim 
said a new positive stage has started in our relations that is 
"very favorable for cooperation in sustainable development and 
investments. Potential issues of conflict have been eliminated."

  [Text] Washington -- Radiant with the agreement reached 
with the Brazilian Government, by which our country agrees to 
assume a leadership role in the implementation of the new 
intellectual property protection law that resulted from the GATT 
Uruguay Round, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has 
become an enthusiast of Brazil in Clinton's administration. 
According to a well-informed source, last week he said to 
several of his colleagues: "See what you can do in Brazil's 
favor. The Brazilians are good people and it is time to give 
them a hand." 
  It has been almost a decade since we have heard a member of 
the U.S. Government say something similar. In view of the 
deterioration of Brazil's image and the interest in our country 
in Washington, any positive comments on Brazil in official 
circles were regarded, in the best of cases, as the prelude to a 
sarcastic joke. 
  Kantor, in truth, has a good political reason to try 
obtaining support for Brazil. He believes that positive 
gestures from other government areas will help the Brazilian 
executive branch convince Congress to approve the Industrial 
Property Code amendments agreed on with Washington. If this 
does not happen by mid-June, Kantor will resume his actions 
against Brazil; he will impose commercial sanctions against our 
country. Instead of a successful negotiation, Kantor will have 
resounding failure on his hands. 
  But, on the other hand, Kantor's new attitude may mark the 
beginning of a significant change in the U.S. attitude toward 
Brazil. The patents agreement is merely part of a process to 
review Brazil that already is being carried out simultaneously 
by several sectors of the U.S. Government. 
  Recent Brazilian decisions, such as the ratification of the 
nuclear nonproliferation agreement with Argentina and its 
decision to sign the Missile Technology Control Regime, have 
removed some ancient obstacles. The political stabilization 
program, the political implications of the IMF's support or 
rejection of the anti-inflationary program, and the increasingly 
tight deadlines for the signing of an agreement by Brazil with 
the creditor banks will force the Treasury to make decisions as 
of this week. 
  Another factor is the defects that have surfaced during the 
past few months in countries chosen by the United States as 
models for Latin American reform: The Chiapas rebellion in 
Mexico and revolts and signs of problems in the Argentine 
economy have revealed the weakness of the countries chosen as 
models and have prompted a reassessment of the region. 
  The domestic debate has hardly started. High-ranking 
government officials, such as Kantor, who currently uphold a 
more constructive and hopeful attitude toward Brazil admit that 
their stance is not predominant. But the possibility of a 
change of attitude does exist. 
  A recent internal analysis of the U.S. State Department 
implicitly appreciated the warning made by former Brazilian 
Ambassador to Washington Rubens Ricupero in December 1992 as he 
criticized the negative stereotype adopted by the United States 
regarding Brazil in a speech. Ricupero warned that this 
simplistic approach prevented the United States from truly 
valuing the democratic character of the country's transformation 
process. Focusing his attention on Chiapas and the meager growth 
experienced by Mexico and Argentina, the analysis' author 
resorted to former President Richard Nixon's famous theory and 
wrote that, in conclusion, the consolidation of political 
democracy and a free market economy in the region, upheld by 
Washington, is subject to what happens in Brazil. 
  The same theory was upheld last week by economist Albert 
Fishlow of California University. "The future of the 
hemisphere's economic integration will not be determined by the 
debate regarding Chile or Argentina's entry into NAFTA but by a 
future agreement to substantially reduce commercial tariffs 
between Brazil and the United States," asserted Fishlow. He 
regards that agreement as a natural result of the current 
stabilization program's success. 
  The geo-economic logic of the search for markets 
characteristic of Bill Clinton's foreign policy also has 
contributed to bringing Brazil back on to Washington's radar. 
For obvious reasons the U.S. Commerce Department has placed 
Brazil on the list of the 10 top emerging markets in the world, 
for which it is preparing specific penetration strategies. With 
an stable economy, development, and an increasing number of 
consumers, Brazil now fits U.S. interests.

<F P=106> [From the "Notes and Information" page: "The United States </F>
Sidesteps GATT"] 
  [Text] We believed that the approval of the Uruguay Round 
of the GATT meant the threat of a international trade war, like 
the one of the 1930's which internationalized the recession, had 
been averted. Suddenly, however, by what may be deducted from 
the attitude of -- paradoxically -- the country that most 
struggled for the approval of the Uruguay Round -- that is, the 
United States -- we can see that the danger has not been 
averted. The Democrat U.S. Government, under the pretext of 
liquidating protectionist practices of other countries, refuses 
to solve its conflicts within the World Trade Organization 
[Organizacao Mundial de Comercio -- OMC] which in April will 
replace the GATT by will of its members who want to upgrade the 
authority of this international organization. 
  We knew that a Democrat administration would strengthen U.S. 
protectionism. Lacking the force of Reagan, President Bush 
could not withstand the Democrats in Congress and ended by 
imposing trade retaliations on countries like Japan, India, and 
Brazil. Until now the so-called Super 301 has never been used, 
but Washington will now apply it against Japan, which refuses to 
remove some of its subtle barriers against the entrance of 
foreign products. 
  The U.S. reaction follows President Clinton's decision not 
to 
open further to international trade, especially in the field of 
services. The determining factor, however, was the publication 
of trade statistics by regions in 1993. In 1993 the United 
States, whose exports increased 3.7 percent and whose imports 
increased 8.9 percent, registered a trade balance deficit of 
$115.777 billion -- some 37 percent up on the previous year. It 
must be pointed out that this was not the biggest negative trade 
balance ever registered in the United States -- it reached $152 
billion in 1987, a year when Washington needed support from its 
allies against the USSR and when it was attempting to avoid a 
trade war that could weaken the unity of the anti-Communist 
bloc. The most serious issue is that with $59.3182 billion, 
Japan was responsible in 1993 for 51.2 percent of the total 
international trade deficit of the United States. It is 
interesting to point out that after Japan comes the People's 
Republic of China, the future "big" trader of Asia, with whom 
the U.S. has a trade deficit of $22.7677 billion. 
  Washington wants the government in Tokyo to give up a type 
of 
protectionism that goes against international law. We recently 
observed an example of Japanese behavior when the Japanese 
Government opened the borders to foreign rice. No one in the 
country bought the imported rice even though it was cheaper, 
thus demonstrating the Japanese people's great solidarity with 
its farmers. This does not mean, however, that arguments about 
what can be considered abuses (which certainly exist) within 
Japanese protectionism, should be avoided at the OMC. By 
attempting to assume a bilateral trade policy, the United States 
is -- without recognizing that an international organization and 
not its president should decide if a trade partner is violating 
the GATT norms or its spirit -- encouraging a conflict. This 
kind of isolation on Washington's behalf is a kind of 
imperialism which may not be very well received by other 
countries. It must also be pointed out that the United States 
has been arrogant toward Japan, which is experiencing a 
difficult moment both in the economic and political field. The 
best results cannot be attained through bilateral negotiations 
based on power positions, especially regarding Japan which is 
now becoming aware of its political force... 
  We must add that not all U.S. citizens support the 
application of sanctions against Japan which, after Canada, is 
the second biggest client of the United States -- buying from it 
$47 billion worth of goods and which is also its second supplier 
-- by which it has been of service to the United Sates by 
forcing it to increase productivity. It must be pointed out 
that the sanctions announced will not produce an immediate 
effect: The first list of products that will be object of 
sanctions will be published by the end of September. Only then 
will the Tokyo government react by imposing restrictions on U.S. 
products -- probably agricultural products, which will harm the 
U.S. primary production sector, which has great political 
influence. The issue is that taking into consideration the 
sanctions that will be effective as of October, the White House 
decision causes an immediate effect: It has brought down the 
prices of some agricultural products, among them soybean. It is 
possible that in the long term Brazil may gain from a trade war 
between these two large world powers, but we will be affected by 
the drop in some prices. We will then be able to see that only 
an international trade peace will be good for everyone in the 
long run.

<F P=106> [By Celso Pinto] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- Brazil's negotiations with the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) are not going smoothly. The 
government still hopes to reach an agreement, but it is already 
admitting the possibility of postponing a bit the announcement 
to creditor banks, which was to have been made on 10 March. 
  A high-ranking Finance Ministry source outlined to this 
newspaper three areas of concern for the IMF: excessive foreign 
capital inflow and its impact on the monetary policy; public 
sector salary expenses; and the fiscal policy. A technician has 
said that the IMF is planning a primary surplus (discounting the 
payment of interest and monetary correction target of 4 percent 
of the GNP). 
  The government decided to avoid placing immediate 
restrictions on incoming capital. Provisional Measure 438, which 
was released yesterday, gives the government the possibility of 
creating an IOF [financial operations tax] of up to 25 percent 
on the net value of currency exchange operations. There is 
currently a 3 percent tax applying to foreign capital invested 
in bonds and other securities, and a 5 percent tax applying to 
foreign investment in fixed profit funds in Brazil. There are 
indications that restrictions will be increased. 
  The IMF is also dissatisfied with public servant salary 
spending. IMF technicians claim that 1993 spending grew too 
much, in real terms. The government argues that this was the 
inevitable effect of legal decisions on salary equalization. In 
addition, it argues that during the Fernando Collor government, 
salaries were reduced to levels that are unsustainable in the 
medium term. 
  Rather than concentrating on salaries, the IMF concern has 
always focused on the fiscal adjustment. In this regard, the 
implementation of the URV [real value unit] opens new unknowns, 
about which the IMF is certainly concerned. 
  Here is an example mentioned by a technician: How will the 
URV conversion work for the salaries and utility rates of state 
and municipal governments? The federal government can control 
its own sector, for which austere rules were established, but 
states and municipal districts are independent. These variables 
obviously have direct influence on the deficit of state and 
municipal governments. 
  In the case of the direct federal administration, the rule 
established in the provisional measure creating the URV is 
clear, but the provisional measure still has to be approved by 
Congress. 
  The IMF is designing a primary surplus of 4 percent of the 
GNP as a target for the entire public sector, including 
state-run enterprises, states, and municipal districts. The 
matter is being comprehensively analyzed. The table released by 
the Finance Ministry to restructure the figures of the 1994 
budget after approval of the Social Emergency Fund -- which was 
promulgated yesterday -- estimates interest spending at $7.7 
billion, which is equivalent to slightly less than 2 percent of 
the GNP. This figure corresponds to federal administration 
expenses. 
  The Brazilian promise is to balance accounts from an 
operational point of view, excluding monetary and exchange rate 
adjustment, but including interest in real terms. This means 
that the bigger the spending in interest, the bigger the need 
for fiscal funds for zeroing the operational deficit. 
  The objective of the economic team by reaching a balance on 
operational terms is to end the government need to borrow money 
from the financial market through the issuance of securities 
except to refinance the debt principal. This would reduce the 
pressure on the private sector and would allow, in the future, a 
reduction of the interest rates paid by the government. In the 
short term, however, high real interest rates are an important 
instrument for controlling the implementation of the URV until 
the new real currency comes into effect. 
  There is an basic concept difference behind the fiscal 
debate. The IMF thinks that given that the Brazilian 
stabilization plan is being implemented in an atmosphere of 
political instability and during an election race, it will 
require a fiscal "overkill" [preceding word in English], that 
is, it will require the generation of a fiscal surplus beyond 
what would normally be necessary, as a sure signal of the 
Brazilian intention to stabilize prices. This is why the IMF 
initiated talks with Brazil about an operational 3 percent 
surplus of the GNP. 
  It has been demonstrated in the past few months, however, 
that it will be politically impossible to obtain more than what 
has been obtained. Economic team members say that the IMF has 
accepted the idea of a balance in operational terms and that it 
is only redoing its calculations to determine the consistency of 
such goal. 
  As for the "heterodox" component of the stabilization plan, 
a 
reliable source has said that there are different points of view 
inside the IMF. The "old guard" represented by Sterie Beza, 
chief of the South Atlantic Department, certainly prefers the 
traditional method of fiscal and monetary austerity. Younger 
experts support the principle of removing the indexation of the 
economy, as long as the "basic principles" of fiscal and 
monetary austerity are respected. 
  IMF Manager-Director Michel Camdessus is in a difficult 
position. His image was tarnished abroad and in Brazil after 
endorsing the economic adjustment plan of former Minister 
Marcilio Marques Moreira which never took off completely. Now, 
he is currently much more careful to express support for 
something inconsistent. 
  The IMF, however, does not want to be accused of being 
responsible for preventing the creditors from reaching an 
agreement with Brazil mainly because if the agreement fails, it 
would take a long time to find another opportunity, perhaps a 
year or two, as a consequence of the upcoming presidential 
inauguration. 
  Despite everything, the government is confident that the IMF 
will prepare a letter of intent and a memorandum of 
understanding in time to allow Brazil reach an agreement with 
the banks. The possibility of a postponement is nonetheless 
already being admitted. 
  It would be necessary to announce on 10 March the reaching 
of 
a technical agreement and to sign the agreement on 15 April, the 
day the agreement with the banks and bond issuance expire. 
Instead of postponing the 15 April deadline, which would require 
the approval of 95 percent of the creditor banks, it is possible 
that, if necessary, the date for announcing the reaching of an 
agreement be brought forward from 10 March. This would give the 
IMF experts more time to clarify their doubts and monitor the 
implementation of the URV. 
  A postponement of this kind, if it happens, will not be very 
traumatic. A postponement would be much more serious if it were 
the consequence of disagreements over substantial subjects. But 
this possibility is currently not on the horizon. 
  There exists a frank skepticism toward the Brazilian 
stabilization plan in the IMF's sister institution, that is, in 
the World Bank (IBRD). The idea there is that the fiscal 
adjustment plan so far implemented is clearly not enough. 
  In the times of the economic plan of Minister Marcilio 
Marques Moreira, the IBRD was a harsh critic and clearly told 
the IMF that it did not agree with its endorsement of the 
Brazilian plan. So much so that the IBRD conditioned the 
approval of structural credits to Brazil on the execution of the 
agreement with the IMF for at least six months, something that 
never happened.

  [Text] Brazil must modify its domestic laws to adapt them 
to the GATT Uruguay Round documents that will be signed on 12 
April in Marrakesh, Morocco. 
  Last week, during a meeting at the Foreign Ministry with the 
rest of the ministries and the Central Bank, government 
representatives assessed the commitments Brazil will assume and 
the strictness with which it will have to implement the terms of 
the aforementioned document. 
  The Uruguay Round agreement will not only require the 
amendment of laws but also a change of attitude by the 
government bureaucracy such as the following: 
  The subsidy and compensatory payment code must be improved, 
especially because the defense of the Brazilian agricultural 
trade must be efficient, agile, and cautious to avoid mistakes 
such as the one that caused Brazil to lose a case within the 
GATT to the European Union (EU) regarding the application of the 
compensatory rights to powdered milk importers. 
  Marques Porto [chief of the International Trade Policy 
Department of the Foreign Ministry] said that the codes must be 
in keeping with the GATT procedures. 
  The Central Bank and the Finance Ministry will have to be 
alert not to increase obstacles to foreign companies in the area 
of financial services because the country will assume the 
commitment to freeze at the current level the restrictions for 
access to the market. That requirement will also be demanded 
from officials of the Transportation Ministry. 
  The improved regulations of the Brazilian customhouse must 
be 
ready before the enforcement of the commercial agreement of the 
Uruguay Round which is scheduled for mid 1995 goes into effect. 
  Brazil needs to have "a corps of specialists" in the GATT 
and 
in the European Union as well as an independent internal 
organization to deal with issues such as the compensatory rights 
and "anti-dumping" measures. 
  Until 12 April Brazil will no longer make any concessions to 
its Uruguay Round partners unless it receives some benefit. 
  It is said that the hope is that there will be no reduction 
in the U.S. quota for additional imports of orange juice and 
shoes. 
  The multilateral agreements negotiated in the Uruguay Round 
which Brazil will sign in Marrakesh, Morocco, on 12 April will 
require the government to make a great effort to adapt them to 
the country's domestic laws. Last week, the Foreign Ministry 
called the attention of other ministries and the Central Bank to 
the need to improve mainly the codes on compensatory rights and 
subsidies because the defense of the Brazilian agricultural 
trade must be agile and careful at the same time. 
  Joao Gualberto Marques Porto, chief of the International 
Trade Policy Department of the Foreign MInistry, explained: With 
the approval of the "peace clause" included in the agreement on 
agriculture which restricts the complaints by the partners of 
the European Union -- which are committed to the elimination of 
their agricultural subsidies in nine years which is how long the 
clause will be in effect -- Brazil will be able to begin an 
investigation against the Europeans but it will have to "put it 
on hold" and, if possible, before charging them before the GATT, 
negotiate with them. 
  For example, if Brazil feels threatened by subsidized 
exports, it would be advisable first to get the Europeans to 
increase the prices of their products instead of immediately 
suing them for compensatory rights or anti-"dumping," said 
Marques. 
  The Brazilian failure in the powdered milk case was a lesson 
when Brazil lost in a "panel" (special committee of experts of 
the GATT) late last year a case on the request of the European 
Union which demanded the payment of compensatory rights on its 
export products. Marques Porto said Brazil will still appeal 
GATT's ruling because it continues to believe that the European 
Union subsidizes its sale of powdered milk, but it also 
recognizes that the terms were not respected and that this gave 
room to the European accusation that GATT procedures were not 
complied with. 
  Marques Porto said: "We have to reestablish a capable 
bureaucracy for a quick and effective defense that cannot be 
questioned: we must have the ability to detect the "dumping" or 
subsidy and establish the degree of damage with the application 
of adequate taxes. But it is essential that this be done in 
accordance with the procedures advocated by the GATT." 
  Another key issue was raised at the meeting between 
Brazilian Foreign Ministry representatives and those from other 
federal administration agencies: Brazil's commitment to freeze 
at current levels its restrictions on foreign participation in 
the supply of services. Brazil had offered to maintain the 
"status quo" in this particular field which means that the 
Central Bank and especially the Finance Ministry must take great 
care not to increase red tape to make sure the country does not 
get punished. Marques Porto said: "Brazil cannot restrict 
access to its market any further." 
  It has been decided to follow Japan's suggestion on 
financial 
services and new negotiations will take place six months after 
the agreements reached at the Uruguay Round go into effect -- 
somewhere in mid 1995 -- "taking into account the new 
conditions," to see whether the the GATT principle of most 
favored nation applies to this issue. This principle recommends 
that benefits granted to one country should be granted to all 
other member countries as well. 
  Marques Porto explained: "The Central Bank and the Finance 
Ministry will have to keep their eyes on the international 
situations to find out to what extent Brazil can improve its 
access to foreign markets and establish whether it is worthwhile 
to make a better offer." Marques Porto believes that the 
Uruguay Round will have a "significant impact" on the Brazilian 
economy. 
  At the meeting with representatives from other ministries 
that took place at the Foreign Ministry, Marques Porto also 
mentioned that Brazil needs to have a "group of experts" with a 
good grasp of the GATT and the EU, a group capable of dealing 
with issues such as compensatory rights. This would have to be 
an independent group, free from political pressures, and able to 
help Brazilian exporters who may be accused of unfair practices 
and to determine the extent of domestic harm inflicted. Marques 
Porto added that customs services will have to adjust to GATT's 
new standards.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Bahia State Governor Antonio </F>
Carlos Magalhaes by Tales Faria in Salvador; date not given] 
  [Text] [Faria] How does the pre-electoral picture look to 
you? 
  [Magalhaes] I find it quite undefined because there is still 
only a single known candidate: Lula [Inacio Lula Da Silva] of 
the PT [Workers Party]. Since he never captures more than 
one-third of the electorate, it does not seem he will be elected 
by a majority. The country is trying to find a solution without 
Lula. But those who think like that have not yet found the road. 
It is a difficult road to find not only because there are many 
parties fighting for leadership but also because there are many 
interests and personal problems. 
  [Faria] During the national PFL [Liberal Front Party] 
meeting, part of the party wanted to launch your presidential 
candidacy. But you found a way to stop it. Why? 
  [Magalhaes] It would be hasty. First of all, the party must 
finish its government program. If Brazil is in a bad state of 
mismanagement, it is up to the PFL to show the country the 
excessive size of the state and the bad use of public 
administration. The party can do that even in alliance with 
other organizations if the essential part of the program we are 
drawing up is maintained. An alliance in the first round may be 
the best solution, not only for the party but also for the 
country. The PFL could make alliances with almost all parties. 
Any party making alliances should not be prejudiced. It should 
not exclude anyone. 
  [Faria] But the noticeable aspect of the PFL national 
meeting 
was the great interest in an alliance with the PSDB [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party]. 
  [Magalhaes] The truth is local problems have great influence 
on parties in making alliances. I believe local problems will 
not hurt an important national alliance. The PSDB is a party 
that has leaders with whom an alliance is possible. For example, 
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Governor Ciro Gomes 
(Ceara), PSDB President Tasso Jereissati, and party leaders 
Mario Covas (Senate) and Jose Serra (Chamber of Deputies) are 
very good men. In the case of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, he 
obviously has a good image in the media despite the 40 percent 
monthly inflation rate. I believe if inflation is not defeated, 
his candidacy will not hold. But if inflation is defeated, he 
will be a strong presidential candidate in any alliance. 
  [Faria] Do you believe the minister's economic plan can 
defeat inflation? 
  [Magalhaes] That plan is better than nothing, but it will 
only be good if it is made to last. The truth is that the plan 
came too late; it should have been presented before. The date 28 
February is dangerous because it marks the launching of the 
Cruzado Plan. The new plan cannot have the false promises of the 
Cruzado Plan, which became an electoral plan. It must be lasting 
and aimed at carrying out a profound state reform. But I have 
confidence that the minister and his economists will not deceive 
the nation and that they have a good chance to succeed. This is 
possible because there are now favorable international 
conditions that did not exist when the Cruzado Plan was 
implemented. 
  [Faria] You seem to have some enthusiasm for Cardoso and not 
for Prefect Paulo Maluf, who advocates an alliance between the 
PFL and the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]. 
  [Magalhaes] I have no prejudice about names. I had a meeting 
with him the other day, and he would not be an obstacle to any 
kind of contacts. But I do not have to launch his name. I know 
he has some frictions with the PFL that might or might not 
disappear, depending on his work with our party members and on 
the changes made in Sao Paulo Prefecture. Maluf still has to 
present an administrative program for Sao Paulo to have the 
nation trust his reputation as a good administrator. He may 
succeed if he spends more time on his administration and less on 
politics. 
  [Faria] Does an alliance include the PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party] of [former Sao Paulo Governor 
Orestes] Quercia? 
  [Magalhaes] I do not exclude the PMDB of any other leader. 
The PMDB currently is very divided and an alliance would be 
better with leaders that unite. According to what I read, Deputy 
Antonio Britto (PMDB-RS [Rio Grande do Sul]) is the leader who 
unites better. But also according to what I read, Britto only 
plans to run for governor of Rio Grande do Sul. Well, I am not 
going to get involved in the PMDB's internal affairs. The party 
leaders can resolve their internal problems, and we will be open 
to an alliance without excluding any names. 
  [Faria] The PFL's total opening sometimes causes surprise. 
Like the contact promoted by PFL Senate leader Marco Maciel (PE 
[Pernambuco]) with [Rio de Janeiro] Governor Leonel Brizola. I 
believe an alliance with Brizola is practically impossible. 
  [Magalhaes] I also believe that. Even with the ability of 
Senator Marco Maciel, I find it very difficult to reach an 
alliance. But I would like to reiterate that I am against 
excluding anyone. 
  [Faria] In other words, you support the theory of the 
government leader in the Senate, Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS), that a 
broad anti-Lula alliance should be made. 
  [Magalhaes] I am against a special alliance against 
anything. 
Brazil does not like the "anti." In Bahia I grew stronger as my 
adversaries became anti-Magalhaes. 
  [Faria] What would be your electoral support in that 
framework? 
  [Magalhaes] I am only talking about Bahia. My situation in 
my 
state is quite reasonable. It is a strong state in the national 
context with an electorate of 7 million people. I believe the 
presidential succession will depend on Bahia, and I will do as 
much as I can to have my party contribute to finding the best 
solution for Brazil, either with my name in front or somebody 
else's name. What I want is for the country to come out of the 
current situation. 
  [Faria] We are getting into the constitutional amendments. 
Do 
you support the reelection of the president and governors, and 
the reduction of the deadline for a candidate to leave his post 
to run for another office? 
  [Magalhaes] I hope to run for a seat in the Senate for 
Bahia. 
But if there is reelection, I will be a candidate for governor 
again with a great chance to win. But I do not believe Congress 
would approve reelection for the current governors. Regarding 
the reduction of the deadline to leave a post to run for another 
office, I would be a hypocrite if I said I oppose it. But I am 
not fighting for it; I would be satisfied if I had three or four 
more months to run my state. At any rate, I am getting ready to 
leave on 30 March. I believe the other governors think the same 
way.

<F P=106> [Article: "PT vs. PT," by Jorgemar Felix and Luciano </F>
Suassuna] 
  [Text] Who will govern this country if Luis Inacio Lula da 
Silva succeeds Itamar Franco? The president, or the PT [Workers 
Party]? The PT spent more than 72 hours in meetings this week, 
if you add the hours of meetings of its national executive board 
in Sao Paulo to gatherings of its federal legislators in 
Brasilia. The more the PT talks, the more complicated the 
situation gets. So far, nothing new. The PT spent what seemed to 
be endless hours debating the main issues faced by the party in 
its 13 years of existence. The difference this time is the 
question mark behind the heated debate on the participation of 
the 36 deputies and Senator Eduardo Suplicy (Sao Paulo) in the 
constitutional revision and the development of the PT platform. 
It is a question mark that is eating away at the party and 
making its candidate for president vulnerable vis-a-vis the bloc 
of opponents. Such questions leave the party--which began the 
1989 election campaign in third place but is now stabilized at 
the top of the polls--at 30 percent, thus facing the same 
dilemma as five years ago. Since then, the PT has expelled its 
more radical faction, the Socialist Convergence, talked to 
businessmen during meetings lubricated with whisky, and visited 
military officers. All this without, however, realizing that it 
was still held prisoner by the radicals. Or, what is worse, the 
radicals, in order not to appear so, have become indecisive. 
They are the tucanos of the PT. 
  At the executive board's meeting on Tuesday 8 February, they 
poked their beaks outside. The date that had been set to decide, 
finally, whether or not the PT legislators could or could not 
participate in the constitutional revision assembly ultimately 
went down in party history as the day of postponement. A party 
with a profile of firm positions, the PT opted to put off the 
decision until 17 February. "We chose that date because Lula 
wants to attend," the coordinator of the party's platform, Prof. 
Marco Aurelio Garcia, confirmed. In favor of PT participation in 
the revision, Lula, the party president, had only five of the 20 
votes. Fourteen others voted for postponement, and only one is 
adamantly against the revision. Having caught a bad cold on his 
fourth caravan trip--this one to Amazonia--Lula was resting at 
home. While convalescing, he was weakened by another virus: the 
political agreements virus. Although prevented from voting on 
the reform of the Constitution, the PT legislators were able to 
vote on the Social Emergency Fund (FSE), part of the plan 
developed by Minister of Finance Fernando Henrique Cardoso. So 
the PT was not in on the revision, but was voting. This 
confusion came about because the executive board would not 
accede to Lula's wishes and those of the majority of its 
congressmen and senators. Nor would Lula accept the executive 
board's radical posture. So the candidate sent a message to the 
board, which was meeting at the Hotel Comodoro in Sao Paulo, 
asking for them to postpone everything until the 17th, the eve 
of the start of yet another caravan trip, this one to the South. 
Garcia does not agree that in that discussion on the FES things 
were all that simple. "Even I, who is considered soft [preceding 
word in English]--I did not think they should vote," he said. 
"But that will be resolved next week." 
  Until then, the legislators, the executive board, and Lula 
are locked in an arm-wrestling contest. The "it" in this dispute 
that resembles a game of blindman's buff is Lula's candidacy, 
which urgently needs alliances and a platform to guide it to 
victory. "There are two distinct roads the PT can take," 
suggests Sao Paulo Deputy Jose Genoino. "It could expand its 
alliances with a platform that does not create obstacles to shut 
out other parties or keep it from governing; or else decide that 
Lula will govern merely by mobilizing the public." The second 
hypothesis Genoino considers to be a mistake. In this 
arm-wrestling phase, the executive board was clever when it 
opted for a confrontation with the party's legislators instead 
of trying to force the adoption of a platform as happened in 
other elections. By attacking the deputies, the factions on the 
left, which have representatives on the executive board, played 
games with people's vanity. Another strategy used by the radical 
is an older one--uniting the other schools of thought. Or 
uniting dissenters from those groups, like the Hour of Truth, 
the most leftist part of Articulation, which is Lula's faction. 
The Hour of Truth was against PT participation in the revision. 
"The attack on the delegation was reinforced by the 
anticongressional sentiments of the PT rank and file--sentiments 
shared by the general public," a party congressman revealed. 
  Seven legislators drafted a manifesto and accepted the 
decision of the radicals. Ten others remained on the fence. The 
majority threatened to break with the executive board. From 
Belem, Lula tried to put the house in order. He sent (in 
different words) the following message: those who are 
dissatisfied had better leave. The party president accepted the 
position taken by the executive board and was insisting that the 
legislators do the same. The 19 rebels then began to negotiate. 
At the meeting with the executive board in Sao Paulo, the leader 
of the legislative delegation, Jose Fortunati (Rio Grande do 
Sul), withstood the fire from the radicals. The payback came out 
of the meeting of the delegation on Tuesday 8 February. The 
deputies accepted the order to obstruct the revision, but would 
disobey the ban on voting, provided they do so as a tactic of 
obstruction. 
  "That is not much," complained Deputy Joao Paulo (Minas 
Gerais). 
  "Calm down, Joao Paulo"--asked his colleague Pedro Tonelli 
(Parana)--"the executive board did not realize that if you give 
us an inch, we can take a mile." 
  That same evening, the PT deputies voted against Minister 
Fernando Henrique's plan. But they did vote. As the legislators 
see it, Lula let the conflict go on because he is holding back 
an argument in his favor in order to negotiate later on, in what 
will be the most important negotiations. In April, the Ninth 
National Encounter will decide, among other things, the policy 
on alliances. Lula needs to shove the tucanos, beaks 
and all, down the throats of the radicals who are in the PT 
leadership. In other words, to do a kindness today so as to win 
tomorrow. Lula is counting on some factors in his favor, such as 
the good will of PSDB President Tasso Jereissati and the 
almost-discarded candidacy of the finance minister. The slate 
may also include the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party], with which 
the PT has already reached an agreement, and the PC do B 
[Communist Party of Brazil]. What we do not know is how the most 
radical wing, the unrelenting opponent of alliances (especially 
with social democratic parties) will behave when this subject is 
on the table. Or whether Lula will be able to convince them as 
easily as he expects. His leadership is also being tested on 
platform issues such as the foreign debt, anti-inflationary 
policy, and the military budget. Depending on the degree of 
radicalism that prevails at the April meeting, his candidacy 
could either be consolidated or weakened. 
  These differences, Garcia admits, are wearing down the party 
and opening a breach through which opponents can attack. "The 
disagreements are being mishandled and are certainly hurting the 
campaign," said the professor, now one of Lula's most 
influential advisers. Garcia emphasizes, however, that those 
discussions are about programs. "No one in the PT is obliged to 
furnish an auditor's report to prove he can be a candidate; in 
this party, the debate is about ideas," he boasted. That is 
precisely one of the questions in the voters' minds: who will 
prevail, the man, or the ideas? "Lula is bigger," Garcia 
answered. Even while extolling the differences and their 
content, Garcia admits that the controversy about the revision 
will leave scars even among those "colleagues," who, until then, 
worked closely together. On Tuesday 8 February, he himself 
became irritated with Jose Genoino. The deputy, reacting to 
pressure from the executive board, had attacked the PT platform 
which, the legislator complained, "worships the State." As 
mentor of the text that will be voted on in April, Garcia was 
furious. "Look, why didn't he pick up the telephone and tell me 
so, why didn't he ask for a meeting to tell me what he thinks?" 
he asked. "They use their access to the press to call the 
executive board bureaucratic, to attack this or that, but I 
could play that game too if I wanted and it would be pure 
nitroglycerine, because I have all the documents," he 
threatened. Among the closest advisors are some who argued on 
Wednesday 9 February that Lula should take a hard line toward 
all this squabbling. "It is time for him to blow the whistle," 
said one of them. In the afternoon of that same day, during an 
interview in Sao Jose dos Campos (Sao Paulo), Lula was still 
mild-mannered in his comments, despite urging autonomy for the 
legislative delegation. 
  No one expects the members of a big party to hold identical 
opinions. That does not happen anywhere in the world. "People 
should look at the cost-benefit ratio of all this, and consider 
whether it helps the party or helps X, Y, or Z," Garcia 
observed. Anyone who is working on Lula's image in the business 
community would be the first to close out the balance sheet in 
the red. "The party is going through a divisive phase; Lula is a 
negotiator and will certainly put an end to this, said 
businessman Oded Grajew, one of the people in charge of setting 
up meetings between Lula and representatives of business. 
Grajew, a former president of the Brazilian Association of Toy 
Manufacturers (Abrinq), recalls that he has often been forced to 
yield or accept defeat. "A president can be neither a dictator 
nor a puppet," he advises.

<H3>  Preaching to the Choir--Professor Analyzes Style of PT 
Documents </H3>
  No Brazilian political party produces more documents than 
the 
PT. There are folders stuffed with papers--directives, programs, 
proposals, opinions, press releases, and so on. The 
petistas write as much as they debate in interminable 
meetings. And every meeting of its directors or officers ends up 
in written form. One of these papers, specifically the 
"Directives For the State Government Platform of the Sao Paulo 
PT" ended up in the hands of Maria Otilia Bocchini, a professor 
at the School of Communications and Arts at the University of 
Sao Paulo (USP). A scholar and expert on social linguistics, she 
made a surprising discovery. The party writes plenty, but the 
voter understands very little of it. "The texts are not clear, 
they are written only for the initiated," she observed. Herself 
a card-carrying petista, Maria Otilia decided to 
suggest some changes to the PT editors. And she did so in a very 
original manner: she put it in the form of a document. 
  With good-humored language, she extracted some "pearls" from 
the platform adopted by PT candidate for governor Jose Dirceu. 
On two sheets of paper, under the title "The PT Way To Write 
Documents," she listed, under 11 topics, the flaws and examples 
of stodginess she found in party language. Using sarcasm, Maria 
Otilia's 11 commandments prescribe exactly what should not be 
done when writing for the "masses"--since that is the party's 
intended audience. "That was the method I chose to call more 
attention to the defects," she argues. In the third commandment, 
"Use a tangle of idle chatter, choose words and expressions 
whose meanings are elastic, vague, and imprecise," she suggested 
a simpler text for the title of the document. "PT Objectives in 
the 1994 elections: elect Lula president and win the governor's 
mansion." Compare this with what the petistas 
preferred: "In 1994, the Brazilian people will have an historic 
opportunity to inflict, via the ballot box, a strategic defeat 
on the dominant sectors of society." 
  According to Maria Otilia, petistas "preach to the 
choir, repeat themselves, use obscure expressions and titles, 
and conceal their thoughts behind difficult words." Evidence of 
this last observation can be found in the latest document from 
the PT oven. On 8 February, the party put out a press release 
entitled "PT Continues Its Obstruction" about the party's 
participation in the constitutional revision. In other words, 
after two days of debate, the PT released an ambiguous paper 
over its internal division. In it, the executive board confirms 
its position against the revision, but speaks of a "maximum 
agenda" and actually postpones the final decision until 17 
February. The fear of appearing to have a limited vocabulary is 
the principal cause of this frustrated attempt at sophistication 
in language. Or perhaps they prefer to complicate things so no 
one really will understand them.

Will, or Will He Be Led Around By the Party? </H3>

  -  Esperidiao Amim, senator, PPR-SC [Progressive 
Renewal Party, Santa Catarina]: "There are so many internal 
splits that no one can tell anyone else what to do. The end 
result is zero." 
  -  Jose Genoino, PT deputy from Sao 
Paulo: "I am afraid the radicals will botch Lula's 
campaign. They have really hurt the PT." 
  -  Jose Paulo 
Bisol, PSB senator from Rio Grande do Sul: "There are both 
utopian groups and forces worried about governability. That 
sparks conflicts within the party." 
  -  Luiz Gushiken, PT 
deputy from Sao Paulo: "As president, Lula will be bigger 
than the PT because his electorate will exceed the boundaries of 
the party."
