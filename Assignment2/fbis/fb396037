  [Text] Managua, 7 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Nicaraguan President 
Violeta Chamorro today played down Costa Rican President Rafael 
Calderon's warning about taking the dispute regarding free 
navigation of the San Juan River, which borders both countries, 
to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. 
  "I do not believe we have to anticipate so much," Chamorro 
said when asked about her Costa Rican colleague's statements 
over the past weekend. Calderon said he disagreed with 
Nicaraguan Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Pallais' arguments for 
charging a $5.00 fee for every tourist coming from Costa Rica on 
the San Juan River. 
  "We will wait and see what happens" with Costa Rican 
President Jose Maria Figueres Olsen, who will be sworn in on 8 
May, Chamorro said in brief statements to the media after 
inaugurating a seminar on juveniles in prison. 
  Nicaraguan Deputy Foreign Minister Pallais said Calderon 
Fournier's statements were "exaggerated" and considered it 
unnecessary to go to The Hague to solve their differences 
regarding the San Juan River. Nicaragua "is free to take the 
measures it considers appropriate in its territory, and Costa 
Rica must respect our decisions," Pallais told reporters when he 
referred to the immigration controls implemented by the 
Nicaraguan Government at the river, which is the border between 
both countries. 
  Last week Pallais asserted that the "Canas-Jerez" treaty 
signed in the last century "only" gives Costa Rica the right to 
navigate freely on the river for commercial purposes, not for 
tourism.

<F P=106> [By Ovidio Bellando] </F>
  [Text] Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella yesterday 
held an unscheduled meeting in London with British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd. 
  The meeting was arranged during Di Tella's stay in Madrid. 
Thus, at the end of President Menem's visit to the Spanish 
capital, Di Tella traveled to Great Britain. 
  In response to a question by LA NACION on the reasons for Di 
Tella's visit to London, Argentine Vice Foreign Minister 
Fernando Petrella said that "bilateral issues were discussed 
during the 80-minute meeting." 
  The meeting had not yet been set by last week when Di Tella 
left for Spain with Menem and very few people knew about the 
possibility of holding it. 
  Petrella noted that "because of the advantage of being only 
a 
few hours of flight away (between Madrid and London), the 
meeting was arranged." He reiterated that Di Tella and Hurd had 
discussed bilateral issues, but he did not specify which issues. 
<H5>  Diplomatic Actions </H5>
  The Di Tella-Hurd meeting may not be unrelated to the turn 
the British position has taken regarding certain Chilean 
sectors, namely the area of defense. 
  Petrella returned yesterday from Santiago, where he had also 
discussed the issue with Chilean Foreign Minister-designate 
Carlos Figueroa. 
  Regarding the British attitude, British diplomats have 
unofficially told some reporters that the long visit made to 
London about 20 days ago by Chilean Defense Minister-designate 
Perez Yoma was prompted by his longtime links with British 
sectors, which invited him to visit "when the electoral victory 
of Eduardo Frei, with whom Perez Yoma is closely associated, was 
announced." 
  The same sources have reported that Baroness Margaret 
Thatcher will visit Santiago 20-23 March, but that she will not 
go to the Malvinas Islands, a possibility mentioned by the 
Chilean press. 
  The British Embassy has reported that Thatcher, who will 
come 
to Chile from Brazil, will go to Mexico after leaving Santiago. 
  It has also been reported by Argentine official sources that 
Thatcher plans to hold a news conference in Chile, to present 
her recently published book, and to meet with some Chilean 
officials in light of her connections with British high-tech 
arms manufacturers.

<F P=106> [Report by Jesus Aranda] </F>
  [Text] Nuevo Laredo, Tampico, 6 Mar -- Upon arriving in 
Nuevo Laredo at the head of a Mexican delegation, Deputy Foreign 
Secretary Andres Rozenthal said the Mexican Government will 
today present the U.S. Government with its official rejection of 
the enforcement of unilateral immigration practices, such as new 
detection and detention methods. The Mexican Government will 
also express its disapproval of the construction of additional 
barriers at the border. 
  During the Mexican-U.S. meeting to be held on Tuesday this 
week, the Mexican delegation will present its views regarding 
each of the actions taken by the U.S. delegation in the past few 
weeks. Rozenthal also denied that the military exercises 
announced by the U.S. Army to be conducted at Fort Bliss, Texas, 
pose a military threat to Mexico or that the exercises are in 
any way related to border or immigration matters. 
  He added that at the end of this "high-level" meeting on 
immigration, authorities from the Mexican and U.S. consuls with 
offices along the border, in addition to officials from 
municipal, state, immigration, customs, and police organization, 
will participate in another session of the Liaison Mechanism for 
the Mexican-U.S. Border. 
  During an interview, Ambassador Rozenthal commented that on 
this occasion the Mexican delegation "will have an opportunity 
to present its views" on the U.S. anti-migration policy, "an 
opportunity that was previously negated." "We were not 
consulted, only notified. For that reason, we will take this 
opportunity to present our specific remarks on those points," he 
said. 
  Rozenthal added that he will meet with Doris Meissner, U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization commissioner, to discuss 
migration and the use of border-crossing cards, measures the two 
countries will adopt as a function of NAFTA to facilitate the 
movement of businessmen among the three countries. Also, 
special importance will be placed on the human rights of 
Mexicans emigrating to the United States. 
  In this meeting, the foreign secretariat delegation will 
present several proposals to control the entry of Americans into 
Mexico. U.S. citizens attempting to enter Mexico will have to 
show a personal identity document to prove their nationality. 
Rozenthal added, however, that the U.S. counterparts will be 
consulted prior to the enforcement of such an action. 
  "We will not do anything without first asking their opinion, 
then we will take specific measures," he said, clearly alluding 
to the unilateral increase of Border Patrol police members, the 
application of new methods for the detainment of illegal aliens, 
and the construction by the United States of additional barriers 
at the border. The Mexican Government has rejected those 
actions not only because they hamper relations between the two 
countries but because Mexico's opinion was not taken into 
consideration. 
  In today's meeting, Rosenthal will insist on a general 
solution of the immigration problem through full communication 
between the two countries, not through police actions such as 
those enforced by the U.S. Government. 
  After presenting studies on the consequences of 
anti-migration actions on Mexicans living in the United States, 
Rozenthal's delegation will initiate legal actions on behalf of 
the Mexicans. 
  Again discussing the U.S. Army's exercises in El Paso, 
Rozenthal said such exercises are conducted every year and that 
at no time has the Mexican Foreign Secretariat observed military 
actions related to border or immigration problems or the alleged 
deployment of military forces at the border.

sustainable development and environmental preservation, which 
were discussed by the two nations' vice presidents in Washington 
in December. 
  [Begin Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas recording] We

<F P=106> [Colloquy among Cuban President Fidel Castro and Politburo </F>
members, Radio Rebelde officials, workers, and retirees at the 
ceremony commemorating the 36th anniversary of Radio Rebelde at 
Radio Rebelde's Studio No. 2 in Havana on 24 February -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Castro] This report I had prepared to refresh 
my memory reads: Radio Rebelde began its broadcasts from Altos 
de Collantes [words indistinct] on 24 February 1958. On 18 
April, following the visit by the commander in chief [words 
indistinct] address regarding the events of the 9 April rebel 
strike, the relocation of Radio Rebelde's equipment begins. 
  That is right. It says here: The relocation begins. What 
approximate date could it have been? 
  [Radio Rebelde veteran worker] I believe it was on the 15th. 
  [Castro] I do not believe it could have been so soon 
afterwards, because first there were the operations conducted in 
La Plata and the nearby region as result of the 9 April strike. 
The troops were very active, were everywhere, conducting 
assaults everywhere, even the Bayamo-Manzanillo road. When the 
failure of the April strike became evident, I started out for 
the station and had to walk a very long distance because to 
reach La Plata -- I do not think I took the Sierra route, but 
the foothills to reach El Alto de Conrado -- it took at least 
three days. I know I stated that I had walked night and day. 
  I must have walked a long time. There were all those clashes 
after 9 April; the long walk to Altos de Conrado must have taken 
six days and that seems on the short side. I believe the 14th is 
less likely. The 15th is a better guess. The 18 April date had 
not caught my attention because it was nine days later. However, 
we began the relocation right away. [passage omitted] 
  Following the great blow of the failure of the strike, the 
enemy had to conduct a forcible, all-out effort to eliminate us. 
It was their moment of highest enthusiasm, highest morale. It 
was logical. To me, their offensive was unavoidable. 
  So I reached the station and reported....[changes thought] 
They were saying the failure had been total. What really 
happened on 9 April is that they managed to choke off the strike 
but we conducted a series of attacks everywhere. We hit them 
hard in Sierra Maestra and Segundo Frente -- where Raul's column 
had recently arrived. [Words indistinct] we inflicted many 
casualties and took weapons. In the military arena, we 
accomplished much although we were only a few. However, they 
reported that the whole thing was a total disaster. This is what 
I explained to them. I have here what I said. It is several 
pages long. I explained everything: what had happened; the 
extent of the fight; that the Rebel Army was intact and that we 
would continue resisting. It was a long message. I was hopeful 
that many people would hear it. I do not know how many might 
have heard it. I do not know whether the station had many 
listeners by 14, 15 or 18 April. You probably know. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Reading from text] And to the people of Cuba, the assurance 
that this fortress will never be vanquished and our promise that 
the fatherland will be free and the struggle will continue to 
the death of the last man. 
  This is how that address concluded. Its exact date is not 
known because no date was recorded. This report cites the 18th 
as the day the relocation begins. However, I must have spoken 
very close to the 18th. It is a matter of estimating the time 
between all that happened on 9 April and the move to where the 
station was located. [passage omitted] 
  Then I must really have walked hard. I stayed in that 
region probably until the 13th. It was on the 13th that we 
realized that the strike had failed. It must have been the 13th. 
I said: I have walked night and day without rest from the area 
of operations of Column No. 1 to keep this appointment with 
Radio Rebelde. The effort! I must have been in better shape 
[words indistinct]. Quite a trek. [passage omitted] 
  In the battle of El Jigue, we adopted the strategy of giving 
out no news until the fighting was over, because if we issued 
news the enemy could hear it. Even after the battle was over, we 
stayed quiet for two or three days in order to remove all the 
weapons and everything. We delayed the report on the El Jigue 
battle for about two days. We played many tricks. We tricked 
them. 
  I think that because of some small flaws a very good movie 
about the El Jigue battle was never released. It should still be 
in the archives somewhere. It was going to be corrected and 
never was. It is more important that it be released, regardless 
of mistakes that can always be corrected. We also fooled the 
enemy there: We fired an initial barrage, then pretended that we 
had withdrawn. They believed it. [chuckles] They began to 
organize a caravan to remove the injured or the like and move to 
the seaside. [Words indistinct] the news, collect the weapons 
and conduct other operations and, before they could tell, fall 
on the troops on [words indistinct] Santo Domingo. 
  [Words indistinct] comrades have collected the historic 
data. 
I have a question: Have all the Radio Rebelde archives been 
preserved? Yes. All the reports, all the news? [passage omitted] 
  [Noel Perez, former CMKC Radio Oriente/Rebelde manager] 
[passage omitted] When you arrived in Santiago de Cuba I asked 
you to address the people, and you, with a tremendous vision, 
described the situation in the entire island. I was there paying 
tremendous attention. You added: Colonel [Ramon] Barquin is in 
Columbia, and has promoted himself and is conferring 
appointments on his confidants, too. And in Cabana there are 
other people. And Camilo [Cienfuegos] has be the only chief in 
Columbia and in Cabana El Che [Guevara]. As soon as you said 
that Barquin was in Columbia, we heard: Attention Radio Rebelde 
CMKC, this is Columbia calling. I answered: This is CMKC Radio 
Rebelde. The other side said: This is Colonel Barquin; put Fidel 
Castro on the line immediately. I said: Commander, excuse me. 
[saluting] I was a soldier from that moment on [laughter]. Fidel 
said: What is it? I said: Colonel Barquin wants to talk to you. 
And you said: Tell Barquin I am not here. Tell Barquin I am not 
here. [repeats] 
  [Castro] I really do not remember that. I told him: Tell him 
that in Columbia I will speak only with Camilo. 
  [Perez] Yes, you added that too. 
  [Castro] That is what I said. Why would I say: I am not 
here. 
I do not want to speak with you. Why in hell would I want to 
speak with an individual who wanted to shirk the Revolution? I 
said: Tell him that in Columbia, I will speak only with Camilo. 
  [Perez] Exactly. And Barquin never called again. 
  [Castro] Of course not. I remember that Barquin also tried 
to 
talk to me in Santiago. I remember that very well. And I said to 
tell him that in Columbia I will speak only with Camilo. It was 
logical. 
  Barquin was taken from Isle of Youth where he was in jail in 
an effort to save the Army. And because he had some prestige -- 
since he had conspired against Batista -- they thought he was 
the man to be placed there. [passage omitted] 
  [Castro] [Words indistinct] while we were organizing the 
offensives by Camilo, Che, by the different columns in different 
places, because in the meantime we also had to fight a battle 
against the elections the government was organizing. 
  In one place there was a period of a certain stability. It 
was after defeating Batista's last offensive. We were no longer 
living like nomads, moving from one place to another. And to 
stay in a given place we had to take precautions because of the 
bombings that came unexpectedly. We had to establish facilities 
in the woods. Because we had to be there several weeks, we had 
to take some initiatives. A hospital was also there in the 
woods, and other installations. We had to prepare a building for 
Radio Rebelde, a house for visitors. Some of the installations 
were made of wood and thatch, but with some protection. It was a 
good place, there in the woods. 
  As I said, there were reporters there quite often. An 
American reporter came and stayed for several days. But we never 
tell who was a reporter and who was not. We were used to answer 
every question asked by reporters. But I realized that that man 
was not interested in anything at all. He was not asking 
questions. He was not a good journalist, he was just fooling 
around, playing a role; but he was not a reporter. I said: This 
is a spy. They sent us a spy. But what are we going to do? We 
could not hold a trial and execute him just on suspicion. So I 
said: We have to do something. He was there a week, and I was 
convinced that Batista had only one alternative, or that he 
could use only the alternative of trying to kill us all by 
intensive bombing. 
  Batista was desperate after his last defeat, and since our 
columns were moving in all directions... [changes thought] I say 
columns but in fact the number of rebels were few. When the 
offensive began in El Jigue we lost approximately 180 men. I 
sent for Almeida who was near Santiago, and I ordered Raul who 
was in [name indistinct], and Guillermo, and Camilo who was the 
last one in El Llano. He was there with only some 30 men. Thus 
with very few men, some 300 altogether [passage indistinct] 
Radio Rebelde one of the important things. We decided to occupy 
the land and not let them pass. 
  In the beginning we used to ambush them [words indistinct] 
It 
was the first time we decided not to let them penetrate. And we 
prepared a strategy of letting them advance while we were 
organizing and concentrating ourselves slowly before 
counterattacking. But apparently those 300 men we had when the 
offensive began by mid-May [passage indistinct] they had 
occupied with 900 men. [passage indistinct] while Raul was 
already in the front hitting some objectives, [passage 
indistinct] other forces in different directions, one column to 
Holguin, another to Las Tunas, others to Bayamo, and both Camilo 
and Che to Villa Clara. All that required some time. 
  Well, Batista's situation was desperate. He had to try a 
blow, a massive attack using the Air Force. He could even try an 
attack with chemical weapons. One day we saw some planes flying 
and we were happy thinking [words indistinct] that some weapons 
were sent to us. It was late in the afternoon and some boxes 
began to fall. They were chemical products dropped in big 
bottles; they killed some chickens and other animals. It was 
because the Army had help from a chemist, [words indistinct] and 
said that the weapon would be effective, but it did not have any 
effect. That would have been a blow on us. But it would not stop 
the war. [words indistinct] 
  When the reporter left, I made some quick mental 
calculations. Two days had passed since he left and he had 
probably arrived and tomorrow he would be in a plane showing 
Batista where we were. Then I told the people: There is a 
clearing before the forest. And there is a little house there. 
If you are coming in a plane to hit the command post, you must 
fix on that little house. So I told the people: We have to get 
this house out of here tonight. Take it away and plant some 
trees there. And tomorrow morning no one must be seen anywhere, 
neither at Rebelde nor anywhere else. We must be at least one 
kilometer away. That is the place to be. And everyone was going 
here and there and asking: But what is this? 
  [Unidentified speaker] You asked for two volunteers to take 
care of the documents. And I remained too. 
  [Castro] That is true. Early in the morning a large number 
of 
planes was flying in circles looking for the command post, but 
they did not find it. They dropped a bomb here and there. So, I 
played their game. On the second day, the same thing. No one was 
there. Because in addition to getting rid of the house [words 
indistinct] because on the third day no one was to move. And on 
the third day the planes did not come. It was just intuition. 
[applause] The case of [word indistinct] was even more 
complicated. There were moments when we had such convictions. 
[Name indistinct] was pressuring us the day before in his own 
style, and at that moment a column was leaving. We were lucky. 
Well, I am not going to tell the whole story, it is a little 
long. Let us save that story for another time. 
  Commander, I always wanted to know [words indistinct] 
undoubtedly it was something very sensitive to set up an antenna 
in the middle of the war. It was easy for the enemy army to 
find. [passage indistinct] What I have never been able to find 
out is how and when did Che sell you the idea of setting up a 
plant or a station to accompany the army. I know that when you 
were young you visited many stations and that you liked radio, 
but when and how did Che convince you of this idea of the radio? 
  [Castro] We were in the area west of the Turquino. Che's was 
one of the first columns we formed following the battle on the 
Ubero [River], and Che moved to that area. We had two positions, 
two columns: Column I and Che's column. Camilo is over there, 
with Che. But Che was a bit more stationary. 
  It was our custom in war to move a lot, incessantly. 
Sometimes enemy columns were chasing us, and at other times we 
were chasing them -- setting a trap. We set fatal traps against 
the troops of Batista's army. 
  But it was a very difficult thing because some of our 
collaborators, messengers, when taken prisoner -- and such was 
also the case with (Elpiru) -- would be promised their lives. 
They would then collaborate instead of returning, as some did, 
and explaining; others would remain with (?both). 
  Thus we set some terrible traps for them, and when against 
all logic those who were supposed to come in this direction 
would go in another -- it was a strange thing. And it was simply 
that there was a guide, someone who knew the area, a messenger, 
one of those people who went back and forth to town, who would 
give information about our positions. 
  We would always take such measures that even if the enemy 
knew more or less where we were, the most that could happen as a 
consequence was that we would not conduct the strike we had 
prepared. Neither could they strike us. Our positions were 
always impregnable, but we were not there long; we would move. 
That was always our style until we established this camp in 
November 1958. Che had more stationary habits. There in [word 
indistinct] we would move a lot. We would come here and cross, 
and then we would make a long excursion. That was on the one 
hand. 
  On the other, he had great initiative to create industries 
and other things. To establish industries you must be 
stationary. Sometimes he was attacked on the mesa, including the 
(Boicito) area. Every so often he had to fight the army there. 
Of course, he did not have sufficient forces to destroy a column 
but he was able to defend himself. Then, to do some of the 
things he wanted to do, he had to remain in one place [words 
indistinct]. 
  That element was characteristic of him. He had many concerns 
regarding information. He planed to set up a newsletter similar 
to the one Maceo had during the war of independence. That is 
where the idea comes up -- it was his idea -- to set up the 
radio station. We were not working at that, because generally 
the vast majority of our forces were in constant movement. From 
this side of the Turquino we would sometimes reach near Niquero. 
From the other side of the Turquino we would sometimes go as far 
as Guisa. The main column was in constant movement -- of course, 
always setting traps for the enemy, an ambush. We would appear 
in the place where [words indistinct] we know they were going to 
try to close our exit routes [words indistinct] prepared. They 
were going to attack us from behind, but our style of fighting 
did not include staying in a permanent place. To have a radio 
station you must have a set location. 
  When Che created the station, as we said here, I visited it 
on 9 April. After 9 April we planned the offensive. We already 
had several things in La Plata. We had a hospital, which needed 
to be protected. We had a land mine factory that also needed to 
be guarded. We had reserve ammunition that we would seize from 
the enemy and we would keep a reserve of bullets. Soldiers use 
lots of bullets and you must always have a reserve. 
  Then, once we had the idea of occupying the territory and 
resisting, the forces that we had were [words indistinct] was 
that of moving Che to the Mina del Frio so that he could take 
charge of the new recruits at Mina del Frio. It was an important 
[words indistinct] that we had in that area. I decided that 
Guillermo and Ramiro would stay in that area. They did not have 
the forces necessary to defend that vast territory against a 
large offensive. Then it seemed better to establish the radio 
station in the most strategic place and where we had superior 
forces to defend the hospital, the land mine factory, the 
reserves and the radio station. 
  We had already made up our minds that no one would be able 
to occupy that territory. That is when we decided to move, prior 
to Batista's offensive, the radio station. But it was Che's idea 
to start a radio station. 
  It was he who conducted all negotiations and who carried 
them out, since he had a stable base. He used different types of 
squabbles with the Army before an attack. But the station could 
be set because we were planning to remain in an area with 
necessary forces so that the enemy would not take it over. This 
was when the decision had been made to move the radio station 
there, our most solid base. 
  We must add that the radio station played a role much 
importance than what we initially imagined. But as I was saying 
it was necessary to note that the station became not only an 
information medium, a source of information of what was 
happening then, but an instrument of war. It became the main 
means of communications between us and the rest of the country 
and with the other columns that were operating, such as Raul's 
column. It becomes the center of international communications 
with the movement; it became a psychological weapon. The small 
station in operation showed the enemy's inability to destroy it. 
It became the center for slogans and revolutionary guidance for 
the troops and for the people in general. As was just 
demonstrated by what the comrade from the Santiago de Cuba CMKC 
station said. 
  Radio Rebelde became everything. And I would say that at 
that 
time it was almost the revolutions's main weapon. Radio Rebelde 
from the very beginning has been characterized by a principle 
which was unfailingly implemented. It was similar to the policy 
we had with the prisoners and with the enemy. We had a policy 
concerning information. Over Radio Rebelde one was not allowed 
to tell, nor did anyone ever tell, a single lie. This was a key 
thing. Never did Radio Rebelde add a single bullet to the 
numbers reported. Never did Radio Rebelde report a single 
casualty less than the true number -- of our own casualties, I 
mean -- nor ever report a single enemy dead or wounded, more 
than the actual number. Nor a single rifle more. I can sum it up 
like this: Not even a single bullet was ever added to the true 
figure. If 581 rounds were captured, we did not say either 582 
or 700 rounds or 1,000 rounds. We would say 581 rounds. Not a 
single bullet more than what was calculated. We were strictly 
exact in our information without any exception whatsoever. We 
also had a rigorous policy without exception concerning 
prisoners, and about tending to the wounded. 
  Just to have an idea of the last offensive, and the quality 
of our medics in the war, there is a report that says that of 
117 wounded soldiers, only two died. I am referring to enemy 
soldiers. We saved the lives of 115 enemy soldiers with our 
medicines. So we had a policy with our enemies that was the same 
throughout the war. It was very effective because they had more 
confidence in us than in their leaders. They believed in what we 
said. And I think Radio Rebelde's credibility was something 
extraordinary, because all our comrades who were elsewhere, and 
who had their own radio stations -- or if they did not have one, 
they did have a radio to monitor Radio Rebelde -- they knew what 
was happening. If they wanted to send a message somewhere, it 
was sufficient to listen to Radio Rebelde and they knew it was a 
message for all, what happened and how it happened, how many 
casualties were inflicted on the enemy, how many weapons were 
seized, how many casualties we had, everything was reported. 
[Words indistinct] once the comrades reached other sites the set 
up other stations. The Second Front only set up about 10 or 12, 
or more stations. You must know how many. Everywhere they could 
they set up a station. By the end, when they were added up we 
came up with almost 40 stations. [Words indistinct] every 
column, we have to keep in mind that every column [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Words indistinct] because of the same war doctrine was the 
same from the same war school, the same ideas. It was a very 
important factor in our revolutionary war. There were not 20 
different schools of war, but a single school of war, and from 
there, everyone added his own piece of an idea, creativity, 
initiatives, etc. And of course the idea of a radio station was 
generalized among all forces of the Revolution. We understood 
the importance of the role played by a radio station in due 
time. Evidence of this is the lengthy walk to the station to 
talk after the strike. It was necessary to have a mass 
communications system with the people and we were in a position 
to do so because we had to have a sound territory. And that is 
why we supported Che's idea. It was exclusively Che's idea. This 
is one of the many initiatives he had, such as the newspaper, 
the radio station, the shoe industry, local industries, and 
others. 
  [Unidentified speaker] I understand that there was an idea 
[words indistinct] that you also proposed a musical program 
within the radio station programming. I know you are a good 
politician but [words indistinct]. 
  [Castro] We used to have the Rebel Quintet, which was 
created 
there. It was famous. But we used music in some battles too. Our 
battles were psychological. If you examine [words indistinct] to 
give our war of liberation as an example, the use of 
psychological warfare during that war. 
  At 0300 we did not allow the enemy soldiers to sleep. We 
figured out ways to keep them awake. We had a (?.50-) caliber 
machine gun. We did not have many bullets, but at 0200, pum, 
pum, pum, three shots. We did not have many 30.06-caliber 
bullets, but we did have many 9 mm bullets that were used in a 
Beretta machine gun. 
  Was it a Beretta, that machine gun? No. It was a smaller, 9 
mm machine gun. I do not remember the caliber of that Beretta. 
  Well, it was not a Beretta, but it was a 9 mm machine gun. 
That machine gun was used all around the front. It fired more 
rounds. 
  Some three shots were fired here, another three over there, 
another three there, etc. However, the rest of the soldiers were 
absolutely forbidden to fire a single shot. Only if the enemy 
came out of their trenches would they fire. The rebels did not 
have permission to fire, because they might run out of bullets 
and the war would be over [laughter]. That was the principle. 
  Automatic weapons were feared. I have certain papers -- 
certain papers, because the papers do not include certain tough 
messages. We used highly expressive words. [laughter] There is a 
dear friend -- we do not want to mention his name -- who said 
that he fired an entire ammunition belt of a .30-caliber machine 
gun in an attack against [Colonel Sanchez] Mosquera. I am going 
to say his name: Guillermo. That (?was bad), but Guillermo 
fought hard against Mosquera with a weapon of such caliber 
[words indistinct] during the first battles of the offensive -- 
because in the beginning, rather ambitiously, they attacked with 
a brigade from this side of the Turquino and another brigade 
from the other side, where we were. We were in the western part, 
and they attacked from the east and west. At a given moment they 
gathered all forces toward the west, where Radio Rebelde was 
located, and all of us. They kept attacking Guillermo and 
Ramirez. Guillermo had a .30-caliber machine gun holding back 
such an attack. Then he said he had used up an entire belt of 
.30-caliber machine gun ammunition. And I sent an order to them: 
People who use an entire ammunition belt and boast about it 
deserve to be executed. [laughter]. 
  That was Guillermo. He used an entire ammunition belt 
because 
Mosquera had extremely aggressive troops, because every so often 
they smoked their marijuana cigarettes. Marijuana was easily 
available. But I never heard a case of a rebel smoking 
marijuana. However, the soldiers once discovered that people 
were planting marijuana among the coffee trees. We did not even 
know what it looked like. Toward the end we did, when someone 
would say: Here is a marijuana plant. It was a beautiful, 
growing tree among the coffee plants. 
  We economized on bullets in an strict manner; we wanted to 
keep the enemy awake and we had to count the bullets. Firing was 
forbidden, except under certain circumstances. Nevertheless, we 
had to keep the shooting going so that they could not sleep. By 
the time we had the troops surrounded they were sleep-deprived. 
[Words indistinct] because at 2300, when you start sleeping, 
three .50-caliber [as heard] bullets whistle by and you lose 
sleep. And we used to do this every night. 
  Every so often we used to bring in the Rebel Quintet, a 
concert for the soldiers. We used to tell them that the support 
troops had been killed, that we had seized the mail sent to 
them, [words indistinct]. The soldiers received letters from 
their relatives through us, because we would capture a company 
and read them the news. Besides, we used not only the machine 
gun bursts but music as well. We did this to relax and 
demoralize them [laughter], although we also played music as 
part of Radio Rebelde's broadcasts, to make its programing 
livelier and more attractive. [passage indistinct] I think the 
members of the Rebel Quintet are still alive. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Yes, they are still around. The old 
man died, but the boys are still alive. His sons are also 
musicians. 
  [Castro] [Words indistinct] the music was part of the 
programing but they were used in the battles as well. The 
loudspeakers did not stop operating, because [words indistinct]. 
You should have seen how those loud speakers could be heard in 
those valleys [words indistinct]. 
  [Eugenio Barrido] Commander, I have heard it said often 
that radio was persuasive, that it reached the people. But there 
was a moment in the hills when you considered Radio Rebelde a 
strategic element, especially for the command. You even compared 
it with the hospital or other installations. What was the main 
factor that caused you, or the Revolution's leadership, to 
consider Radio Rebelde positively, as a strategic point in the 
struggle? Did you place greater emphasis on the military aspect 
or on the political aspect? 
  [Castro] On the political aspect. As far as we were 
concerned, the political and military aspects were closely 
linked. If you did not win the political war you could not win 
the military war. With the few men we had we could not win a 
war, not unless you had the support of all the people. 
  It is true that our soldiers were very effective, although 
they did not have the opportunity to take intensive courses, and 
although their weapons were not modern. Few times have I seen a 
war fought with such tremendous effectiveness, as by those men. 
Let me just tell you that we did not have a single weapon lost 
on the front line. All weapons were counted -- heavy weapons I 
mean, because there were some who had shotguns while others had 
pistols, which are of relative value. We are talking about heavy 
weapons. And according to my calculations, I can give you these 
figures: We had 300, and then 900. I believe we had some 3,000 
men and no more, according to rough estimates. This was the 
total number of armed men by the end of the war, men armed with 
heavy weapons. There were a few collaborators, but not many. But 
as regards heavy weapons, by the end of the war we had some 
3,000 weapons, more than 90 percent of them seized from the 
enemy. 
  I can say the same as regards bullets. That is, there were 
no 
extra rifles, besides those being used on the front. For this 
reason, we can say that the performance of each weapon was high. 
One hundred percent of the weapons were in the battlefield. It 
was a highly efficient war, especially for us, because Batista 
had 80,000 men: policemen, soldiers, sailors. 
  The balance of forces at its best was 30 soldiers to one, in 
Batista's favor. There was a moment when there were 10,000 
Batista soldiers to each of ours, when we were some six or seven 
people. Well, that was the figure in the beginning [words 
indistinct] up to 100. The number of our soldiers increased 
vigorously as of May, after the last offensive. After that 
offensive came the Second Front offensive, when many weapons 
were also seized. But with such a correlation of forces, we 
could not hope to defeat the Army without the support of the 
population. The people had to play their role in the general 
strike. 
  And it was too late for the idea of a general strike. Our 
idea was to take over the Moncada Barracks, seize Santiago de 
Cuba, and then call the entire population to a general strike. 
Moncada was our first thought. 
  The April strike was also an attempt to overthrow the regime 
by means of a general strike. I knew that this was a delicate 
issue, because there were many ideas among us. Within our own 
movement there were people who saw us as elements of agitation 
in the mountains; elements who would, at a given moment, create 
either a general strike or a social explosion, and who would 
eliminate the regime. And there were also those who thought that 
the idea was to create a false situation to effect a coup d'etat. 
  We had different lines of thought within our own movement, 
different ideas. Our idea was to take over the Moncada Barracks 
in Santiago de Cuba, where there were thousands of weapons. And 
if our strategy were to fail and we could not defeat the 
government, we would retreat to the mountains with those 
thousands of weapons. Imagine us retreating with thousands of 
weapons toward the Sierra Maestra, how much it would have 
shortened the struggle, even if the regime was not defeated then. 
  There was also the idea of a guerrilla movement if the 
regime 
was not defeated. The idea included a small army growing strong 
to the point of being capable of defeating the enemy Army -- but 
with the help of the people, of course. 
  But all through the struggle in Sierra Maestra, we had to 
avert as many coups d'etat as were conceived. We used to say 
that if a coup d'etat occurred, the war would continue. That was 
our idea. But at a given moment, we already had sufficient 
forces to resort to the strike. The strike staged in April was 
premature. And it was not from our initiative in the Sierra 
Maestra. It was an initiative of the [26 July] Movement in the 
plains. We must say that the April strike was imposed on us. Of 
course, we accepted it and were equally responsible for the 
April strike. But we did not yet have sufficient military forces 
with which to support a general strike. 
  There was a meeting of the movement, and the movement's 
board 
said: Well, we were up in the mountains and could not very well 
see the situation on the plains; there were subjective factors, 
and for this reason... [changes thought] We were there... 
[changes thought] They were talking about peace. Yes, we 
accepted peace; we would not reject it. But we demanded a 
condition -- that the eastern provinces be handed over to us 
with all their weapons. We were willing to hold elections [words 
indistinct], but hand over the eastern provinces and all their 
weapons. That is, our conditions were impossible that could 
affect the enemy [as heard]. 
  We did not reject any peace proposal, although we did have a 
very clear idea of the Revolution. And to make a revolution, we 
had to have the people. We were very clear on this. The April 
strike failed, and the revolutionary forces, the fighters were 
left alone. Thus, the revolutionary morale collapsed throughout 
the country. That lasted four months until we destroyed 
Batista's offensive. That is, the rebel army destroyed Batista's 
offensive and raised morale, creating new conditions for victory. 
  By the end of December, Batista had already lost the war 
because when the coup d'etat took place, there were 
approximately 17,000 soldiers, according to my calculations 
then, and there might have been more, some 17,000 soldiers 
besieged in the eastern region. The island was divided into two 
parts by the columns of Che and Camilo. He could no longer be 
saved militarily. But the danger of a coup prevailed. We had 
foreseen this because it did happen more than once in Cuban 
history. A coup d'etat that deceived the people, making them 
believe that all problems had vanished. That is history. 
America's history is filled with such examples. When there is a 
tough struggle by the people, a coup takes place and everyone is 
happy and celebrating. But what happens is that new figures 
replace the others. There is no revolution. All through the war, 
through Radio Rebelde in the final stages, we were trying to 
convince the people to reject the coup. Because we were not 
going to accept any coup d'etat. If there was a coup, the war 
would continue. That was our policy. 
  Then finally, what we were going to do on 26 July in 
Moncada, 
we did on 1 January 1959. It was precisely the same idea. And 
the whole country was paralyzed. The country's total paralysis 
helped demoralize the rest of the country. They were no longer 
willing to fight. The story of that comrade at 1000 in the 
morning, that henchman -- Despaine -- still had steam left. He 
was ready to kill. They were killing people even the day before. 
But the demoralization had become generalized at that moment. 
Otherwise, they would have attacked the station. He fired some 
shots there, but after all, he failed to seize the station that 
could have been taken with a revolver. No one was defending the 
station. He sent a burst of fire, and sent someone else over. 
They were demoralized. And the general strike defeated them 
completely. It demoralized them completely in such a manner that 
not a single shot more was fired. The rebel columns disarmed the 
Army during the first days of May. There were few who joined us, 
but you know this history and its impact. We ought to tell 
things as they were, including the meeting I held with the Army 
in Bayamo, where we took [words indistinct] you see around. 
  There I met with approximately 2,000 soldiers who had been 
fighting a tough battle with us until a few days earlier. They 
were the elite forces. I was alone there with them. This had 
already happened to me during the Jigue battle. We had disarmed 
the Army and I was anxious to see the weapons we were to seize, 
so in the middle of the negotiations, I sneaked in at night, but 
they recognized me. And there I was in the middle of all those 
soldiers who were still armed, but remained calm as if nothing 
had happened. We kept talking with [words indistinct] the 
agreements we have reached, but it was there in Bayamo, because 
the troops were absolutely demoralized. A defeated troop is a 
demoralized one. 
  I met with the Bayamo Army in a stadium. Well, they were 
still enthusiastic because they did not know what was going on 
in Havana. There was nothing definite about the operation that 
was to be carried out by that man we just mentioned.... 
  [Unidentified speaker, interrupting] Barquin [as heard]. 
  [Castro] Yes, Barquin. Well, we added things up. I was 
bringing 1,000 rebel soldiers from the east and 2,000 enemy 
soldiers who had joined us [Casquitos]; 2,000 soldiers with 
tanks. We did not know anything about those Sherman tanks, nor 
did we know how to operate the artillery, but we already had the 
auxiliary troops who [words indistinct] just in case. 
  It was a political battle. That is, politics. Such politics 
reached even the enemy line. We were respected because they knew 
we did not mistreat prisoners. We did not beat or humiliate 
prisoners. We did not murder any prisoner. Besides, there was a 
case when a soldier surrendered; there was a war criminal among 
the troops, who had committed crimes; but we assured them that 
they would not be sentenced to capital punishment. Of course 
this was limited to only one or two of those well-known henchmen 
who had killed several people but were also given guarantees. 
The soldiers were set free and the officers were allowed to keep 
their service weapons. 
  This policy that our army adopted was extremely valuable 
because in the beginning no soldier would surrender. They were 
told we would kill them because they were told the great lie 
that in Moncada, soldiers were beheaded in the hospital. That is 
what they said about us when the Moncada was attacked. It is 
true that there were some incidents at the hospital because some 
people mistook the buildings and ended up entering the hospital. 
I went to the hospital and released them. I think there one 
person was wounded, a janitor who climbed up on a window. But 
they spread the story that we had cut the throats of the sick in 
the hospital. And that propaganda had had an impact on the 
soldiers. No soldiers were surrendering. But when the soldiers 
began to realize that when they are made prisoners they were set 
free, that they were respected, they began to surrender. There 
were soldiers who surrendered three times. They surrendered to 
us here in Sierra Maestra, from which they were sent to Las 
Villas; and there when surrounded, they surrendered again, but 
much more quickly. They knew that we were only interested in 
their weapons and ammunition. The soldier [words indistinct] 
that policy, that policy used with the people, the credibility 
of the station, of never telling a lie. But more important yet 
was the policy with the people, because with very few men we 
could not win the war against that large army which did have 
some training, and good weapons, and which above all, had an air 
force with which they strafed us continuously. You know what a 
war is like when the enemy has aircraft, an air force, 
artillery, and tanks, and you have only rifles and land mines. 
We won the war with rifles and mines. But of course, we had the 
soul of the country, the spirit of the country, the support of 
the people, which was decisive in winning that war. 
  Radio Rebelde's political factor was also very important, 
but 
the political factor was not and could not be isolated from the 
military factor. It was symbiosis. Thus, Radio Rebelde played a 
decisive role. Not only that, but all the other factors I 
mentioned here. [passage omitted] 
  Unfortunately I no longer have the collaborator's job I 
used to have [words indistinct] [laughs] nor can I be up-to-date 
anymore and as close to the work you do. I hear some general 
opinions on Radio Rebelde's work, and also some opinions on the 
innovations you have been introducing, but not because I am 
personally close to the station. Unfortunately, I am always busy 
with something, and if I am not doing something, I am reading. I 
have had to rely very much on books because one learns a great 
deal from them. I often want to watch the television newscasts, 
for instance, but I can rarely watch it. Sometimes I listen to a 
three-minute summary of news of what has happened over the 
weekend. I often have meetings, commitments at all hours. For 
this reason, I also read the press very quickly. You know that 
there are very few newspapers. Since there is a paper shortage I 
can do so. I have very little time, few minutes to dedicate to 
radio. But I do read many dispatches. I read many reports to 
learn what is going on in the world, and it takes time. 
  I do not spend much time on radio. I would like to tell you 
that I spend one hour a day listening to radio. I am even 
willing to pledge to listen in, not for an hour, but for at 
least 10 minutes a day. But I do have some very clear and 
precise ideas on the role played not only by Radio Rebelde, but 
by radio in general. 
  I think we must see all radio, throughout the country, as a 
great Radio Rebelde. We must see radio as in the final stage of 
the war when we had radio stations everywhere, all cooperating 
among themselves, helping one another, joining a network, which 
played an essential role. 
  I think there is nothing comparable to radio, for very clear 
and objective reasons. First, because we lack paper. Dozens and 
dozens of publications had to be suspended. Almost all 
newspapers had to be turned into weeklies because of the lack of 
paper necessary for daily publications. Many magazines have 
vanished; others have reduced their editions. So, the printed 
press has lost many resources, and they are costly resources. To 
maintain the level of a press media, a large amount of printing 
paper would be necessary, and there are no resources to import 
them. And I think for a long period of time yet, we will not 
have the necessary resources [words indistinct] the press. 
  With television, we have lost a large number of broadcast 
hours. Television is aired in the afternoon for a few hours, 
usually after 1900, and only for a few hours, due to problems 
with electric power and resources. Television also had to 
considerably reduce its resources to report on events. 
  All these media, both radio and television, have great 
potential. I think television is a [word indistinct] power to 
influence events. We do still have radio, which broadcasts many 
[words indistinct]. There are radio stations everywhere -- in 
all provinces, all municipalities, and its cost is much lower. 
It is perfectly feasible for Cuba to maintain the radio network. 
It was, has been, and will be an important means of 
communication because I see very clearly the decisive role it 
plays. 
  I could compare this moment of the special period, this 
political moment Cuba is facing, with those days of fighting in 
Sierra Maestra, with those days of 1958 we have been mentioning. 
The difference is that this period is more prolonged. I would 
say that this period is more difficult than that one. It 
requires more effort, more talent, more commitment. The work is 
done under complex conditions today, particularly following the 
hard blows the national economy has experienced. Only as a 
miracle of human will can the country's resistance be explained. 
  Now I see radio in general -- I am not referring to Radio 
Rebelde alone -- as a great rebel radio, in a period similar to 
that one, in a very difficult and decisive moment, when the 
radio plays the role of a weapon, a decisive weapon in this 
difficult battle, an even more difficult battle. I would say 
that this battle is even more noble than that battle. 
  At that time we were confronting a local tyrant supported 
by imperialism, while today we are confronting head-on an 
imperialism that employs every resource in an effort to destroy 
us. Today when the socialist bloc no longer exists, I think we 
are fighting a war much greater and more noble than the one 
waged then: a political and ideological battle, a battle that is 
not entirely separate from the military strength of the 
Revolution because to the extent that the ideas grow stronger, 
and to the extent that morale is high, we will also be 
militarily stronger. Although my schedule does not allow me to 
be closer to the radio, I promise to be more interested in the 
way you are working. 
  I talk to many people and they inform me, they tell me the 
news they hear in the morning. Most of the news that is told to 
me is news that people hear on the radio. 
  So I give to radio the same importance given to Radio 
Rebelde 
in the most difficult and decisive moments of our war of 
liberation. I hope the workers, the reporters, all those who 
work in radio will be aware of this and will be at the level of 
Radio Rebelde back then. 
  Someday, new generations will meet here again; the younger 
ones and some of the older ones will meet here again. They will 
meet to recall the important role played by radio during these 
difficult days of the special period. [applause] [passage 
omitted] 
  I have always liked radio. Even in my youth I used the radio 
in the political struggle. I had a radio [words indistinct]. It 
forced me to work hard. I worked hard with journalists. [Words 
indistinct] the newspaper with the highest readership back then. 
[Words indistinct] four times a week and I had extensive 
articles ready. [Words indistinct] wanted to evict the 
neighbors. [Words indistinct] I researched all the businesses 
the government had created, land it had purchased cheaply, 
projects in which it had invested, and how it had made a million 
pesos. I researched the property records [words indistinct] and 
I would report this in the newspaper and over radio. A radio 
station creates an awareness among its listeners; it becomes a 
power. [Words indistinct] The neighbors became [words 
indistinct]. I have never told this before. This was due to... 
[changes thought] I joined them, managed the mail [words 
indistinct]. It was always a voice denouncing the corruption, 
theft, when [words indistinct]. Then I used it [words 
indistinct]. [passage indistinct] We do not have to go to 
Guatemala. All their businesses were there. The notary and 
property records, the prices; I published all this. [Words 
indistinct]. I had just graduated. I was not very experienced as 
a lawyer but I had the energy to spend hours doing research. I 
used to go and find the data for the newspaper and always was 
saying: We do not have to go to Guatemala. Of course, he charged 
that someone had given him the information, but could not prove 
it. He was harshly attacked. After his death there was no one to 
follow him. A bit of that emptiness [words indistinct] to work, 
speak seriously. [Words indistinct] near Maceo Street and 
President Avenue, no. 1600? [passage omitted] 
  On the fifth floor of a tall building. I had to run to 
arrive 
on time. [words indistinct] Everything since was mortgaged 
because they charged me a [words indistinct]. They did not pay 
me for that. I gave great propaganda to the station, increased 
its ratings, and had to pay. It was only 15 minutes of very hard 
work. Radio work is hard. It was a fixed schedule. You had to 
make it on time and have all your information together. I had 
that experience in radio, and also in journalism. I am not 
familiar with television work. 
  I have to take full advantage of the few hour I have 
available. [Words indistinct]. Our greatest weapon is radio.

<F P=106> [By Ovidio Bellando] </F>
  [Text] Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella yesterday 
held an unscheduled meeting in London with British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd. 
  The meeting was arranged during Di Tella's stay in Madrid. 
Thus, at the end of President Menem's visit to the Spanish 
capital, Di Tella traveled to Great Britain. 
  In response to a question by LA NACION on the reasons for Di 
Tella's visit to London, Argentine Vice Foreign Minister 
Fernando Petrella said that "bilateral issues were discussed 
during the 80-minute meeting." 
  The meeting had not yet been set by last week when Di Tella 
left for Spain with Menem and very few people knew about the 
possibility of holding it. 
  Petrella noted that "because of the advantage of being only 
a 
few hours of flight away (between Madrid and London), the 
meeting was arranged." He reiterated that Di Tella and Hurd had 
discussed bilateral issues, but he did not specify which issues. 
<H5>  Diplomatic Actions </H5>
  The Di Tella-Hurd meeting may not be unrelated to the turn 
the British position has taken regarding certain Chilean 
sectors, namely the area of defense. 
  Petrella returned yesterday from Santiago, where he had also 
discussed the issue with Chilean Foreign Minister-designate 
Carlos Figueroa. 
  Regarding the British attitude, British diplomats have 
unofficially told some reporters that the long visit made to 
London about 20 days ago by Chilean Defense Minister-designate 
Perez Yoma was prompted by his longtime links with British 
sectors, which invited him to visit "when the electoral victory 
of Eduardo Frei, with whom Perez Yoma is closely associated, was 
announced." 
  The same sources have reported that Baroness Margaret 
Thatcher will visit Santiago 20-23 March, but that she will not 
go to the Malvinas Islands, a possibility mentioned by the 
Chilean press. 
  The British Embassy has reported that Thatcher, who will 
come 
to Chile from Brazil, will go to Mexico after leaving Santiago. 
  It has also been reported by Argentine official sources that 
Thatcher plans to hold a news conference in Chile, to present 
her recently published book, and to meet with some Chilean 
officials in light of her connections with British high-tech 
arms manufacturers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Conservative Party presidential candidate </F>
Andres Pastrana, 11 February, in Bogota, by Maria Teresa 
Ronderos and Jorge Gonzalez] 
  [Excerpts] Twelve hours after presenting his platform at a 
hectic and colorful session in the Convention Center, Andres 
Pastrana still seemed very animated. 
  Since 0600 on Friday he had been taking calls from radio 
stations and at the request of one of them, he exchanged 
greetings with Samper, responding with a "very good, my dear 
Ernesto," to a somewhat cool "well, how did it go?" 
  Then he met with journalists from EL TIEMPO in his apartment 
where, accompanied by Luis Alberto Moreno, his campaign 
coordinator, and Jaime Ruiz, his issues adviser, he was getting 
ready to begin his first campaign trip through Antioquia. 
  [EL TIEMPO] You have urged Ernesto Samper to challenge your 
ideas. You told him that neither your father nor your moustache 
are issues for debate. What might be the major conceptual 
differences between the proposals you made on Thursday and 
Samper's? 
  [Pastrana] I presented a platform in which I say not only 
what I am going to do but how I am going to do it, where we will 
get the resources, and on what areas our seven priorities are 
going to focus. The program is backed by solid work and 
supported by a reliable team. Our proposals are specific and 
they in no way are the result of improvization. 
  I find contradictions in Dr. Samper's ideas. I agree with 
Dr. 
De la Calle that Samper changes his mind a lot. For example, I 
have always believed in the "apertura" [trade liberalization] 
and I have always opposed legalizing drugs. I do not know if 
Samper agrees or does not agree with me this week. [passage 
omitted] 
  [EL TIEMPO] You say that there are strong similarities 
between you and President Gaviria. How does your platform differ 
from what he has done? 
  [Pastrana] I agree with his economic approach. He laid the 
foundation and now we have to build the structure. The 
difference is that I am calling for a strong social investment. 
I will base this on an education policy that ensures that not a 
single child will not go to school. Education will give us what 
we need so that we, the Colombian people, can begin to compete 
in international markets. We are going to generate the 
infrastructure required for modern development. We will have 
roads, efficient communications, and ports. We plan to create a 
revolution in water, not only to ensure 90 percent coverage in 
providing service, but also to promote its appropriate use in 
agrarian development. We have already calculated the resources 
needed. [passage omitted] 
  [EL TIEMPO] People recognize the effort you have made to be 
independent of your father. But there are some issues, like 
international policy, on which when you speak it seems as if 
Misael and not Andres were speaking.... 
  [Pastrana] One thing needs to be understood: few times in 
political history has a former president seen that his son might 
reach the presidency. I imagine that would not be easy to deal 
with. At least not for a man with the character and temperament 
of Misael Pastrana, a person who likes to express his opinions, 
who fights openly for his party and for his ideas. 
  On international policy, we have a very important group of 
people who are truly knowledgeable about these issues. If there 
is one thing on which I agree with my father, it is that 
international policy should not be handled in isolation by one 
party. 
  [EL TIEMPO] But in this area some of your father's proposals 
belong more to a nationalism of a bygone era. 
  [Pastrana] Are we perhaps talking about the 
marines? Fine, we can do that. If there really are 
troop movements, the president has to make the issues clear. The 
government has said that it failed to provide information. It is 
still possible to convene the Advisory Commission on Relations 
to help clear up unknown factors. 
  Since I am on this issue, here is another difference between 
myself and Samper. During my government I will bring in foreign 
advisers to help coordinate the campaign against narcoterrorism. 
He said he would not do that; he does not know that we need 
strong methods to fight this scourge. 
  In this field, I have developed my own policy, my own 
contacts. I chaired an organization of 16 Latin American 
parties. I have ties of friendship with President Caldera and 
his family, and also with President Frei of Chile. I am a friend 
and I went to school with President Figueres of Costa Rica. We 
have excellent relations with President Cristiani. I also have 
excellent contacts in Europe. That will allow us to consolidate 
the integration process, going beyond international treaties. We 
have already promoted our own course of action, which is very 
much my own. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Your family has a high political profile. Your 
father is a former president. Your brother is the editor of a 
militant opposition newspaper. Do you share the view that your 
family may become your Achilles heel? 
  [Pastrana] The Pastranas, as my brother Juan Carlos said, 
are 
a family and not a herd, so everyone will continue to pursue the 
activities to which he has devoted himself so far, with mutual 
respect and independence. I have never considered my family my 
Achilles heel, but I must say that I now fear LA PRENSA's 
headlines. [passage omitted] 
  [EL TIEMPO] Now that Escobar and the myth of the Medellin 
Cartel are dead, what would you do about the Cali Cartel? 
  [Pastrana] I have been quite clear about the need to curb 
the 
drug traffic and not to legalize the production, sale, and 
consumption of drugs. We are going to revise our antidrug 
strategies to make them more effective. I have not been informed 
about the negotiations with the Cali Cartel. I support them as 
long as they are in compliance with the law and the policy of 
bringing criminals to justice. I do not accept and will not 
accept the policy of house arrest. That is ridiculous; it would 
be shameful. What is needed is severe punishment, not a reward. 
  [EL TIEMPO] The possibility that drug traffickers may end up 
with ridiculously small penalties is of great concern to the 
United States. They demand that the punishment be proportional 
to the crime. Do you think that fear is reasonable? 
  [Pastrana] Why do they not apply that approach in their 
country? Carlos Lehder was sentenced to life in prison plus 100 
years. Now, according to what we have heard, he was transferred 
to a German jail and given special privileges after 
negotiations. When I was in Washington in 1990 I proposed that 
we pursue a policy similar to plea bargaining; the 
press jumped all over me and asked me why I was suggesting such 
an idea. "Why are you so upset? That is your system, we are 
going to copy it," I answered. And we have copied it, to such an 
extent that the first legislation was issued by decree. What was 
wrong with that? That we might negotiate in search of peace? But 
when the drug lords sought through extradition went [to the 
United States] and got the "perks" of plea bargaining 
by turning in other people, that was not criticized. 
  I agree that we need to seek a fair sentence from the legal 
point of view. I insist that penalties must be served in prison. 
The policy of bringing criminals to justice must be consistent. 
  [EL TIEMPO] You have announced that you will not accept 
campaign contributions from the Santo Domingo Group. Does this 
mean your government would pursue an energetic policy of 
controlling concentrations of wealth? 
  [Pastrana] As they should be, my campaign books are open to 
anyone who wants to see them in the Treasury Inspector's Office. 
A policy needs to be developed to protect citizens from abuses 
by private and public enterprises that take advantage of their 
dominant position. Another very important issue is regulating 
lobbying and political campaign financing. 
  The regulation of the monopoly system concerns me, 
especially 
as it relates to the Television Law. I believe we have been lax 
because the government has run the television system. If we want 
to protect the citizens' right to be well informed, we can not 
continue to be so lax. Furthermore, regional autonomy will not 
become a reality without excellent territorial legislation. We 
need to strengthen and pay attention to the commission created 
by the 1991 Charter. The truth is that the bill now pending in 
Congress is very weak.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi in La Guaira, Venezuela] </F>
  [Text] Reacting to the U.S. decision to reinstate its Super 
301 trade law, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said: 
"We are concerned about the use of unilateral measures. The 
spirit behind the GATT Uruguay Round agreement is that all 
problems should be resolved multilaterally. One of the Uruguay 
Round's major achievements was the decision to strengthen the 
multilateral system as an advanced way of resolving 
controversies." On 4 March, Amorim held a working meeting with 
his Venezuelan counterpart, Angel Burelli Rivas, in La Guaira, a 
city located near Caracas, to negotiate the signing of an 
economic complementation agreement between their two countries. 
  Although Venezuela has no substantive trade problems with 
the 
United States -- as Burelli Rivas told GAZETA -- the Venezuelan 
press gave wide coverage to the new measure announced by 
President Bill Clinton. The Venezuelan media believe the Super 
301 will give Clinton special powers to pressure Japan into 
opening its market to U.S. products. 
  In the opinion of Burelli Rivas, the Super 301 could bring 
problems to the United States within the GATT Uruguay Round 
agreement.

in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, the first stop on his tour 
of South and Southeast Asian countries. His tour includes Laos; 
Myanmar, formerly known as Burma; Cambodia; India; Malaysia; and 
Vietnam. 
  In declarations to the press before his departure, Robaina 
explained that Cuba would like to observe the economic results

though no agreements are expected to be signed, the visits will 
allow Cuba to extend and open new possibilities for cooperation. 
Robaina pointed out that among the topics to be discussed with 
the various governments are the role of the nonaligned movement 
and the upcoming meeting of foreign ministers that will be held 
in Cairo toward the end of May. 
  Robaina is scheduled to meet with heads of governments, 
businessmen, associations of friendship with Cuba, 
representatives of the press, and his counterparts.

<F P=106> [Telephone conversation between reporter Rey Rodriguez, for </F>
Cuban radio and television and PRENSA LATINA, and Rebelde 
reporter Roberto Cavada from Jakarta -- live] 
  [Text] [Cavada] This is a direct link via satellite with 
Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, where Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina arrived a few hours ago, beginning a tour of 
several Asian countries. I have reporter Rey Rodriguez on the 
line, who is accompanying the foreign minister as a 
representative of the Cuban radio and television network and 
PRENSA LATINA. Rodriguez will give us further details on the 
foreign minister's activities, for all Cubans. 
  Rodriguez, I think it is appropiate to tell the Cuban people 
about the initial activities in Jakarta of the Cuban delegation 
headed by Roberto Robaina. Greetings from Havana, Rey. 
  [Rodriguez] Well. Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
arrived in Jakarta tonight at approximately 1930 for an official 
visit to Indonesia, the first leg of his tour of seven Asian 
countries. At the Sukarno-Hatta International Airport, the 
foreign minister was welcomed by Sukhari Siregar, director of 
the Indonesian Foreign Ministry's American Department, and by 
Latin American ambassadors accredited to this country. 
  When asked by the local press, Robaina said that one of the 
objectives of this trip is to describe the true situation in his 
country, as well as the reforms being carried out in the 
economic area. Concerning Robaina's objective in the commercial 
area, which is to strengthen trade relations with this country, 
Robaina said: 
  [Begin Robaina recording] From the commercial point of view, 
there are already important links with Indonesia. But above all, 
there are new possibilities for investments in my country. In 
the medical and pharmaceutical industry, and in the area of 
(?meteorology), Cuba has obtained modest results which I think 
may be of interest to you. In the particular case of Cuban 
relations with Indonesia, you are aware of certain negotiations 
that have already been established. These areas are as important 
as rice, oil, and [word indistinct] which we hope will be 
increased. [end recording] 
  This is all we can tell you about the Cuban foreign 
minister's activities today in Jakarta. Are you listening there, 
Cavada? 
  [Cavada] Yes. We read you clearly, Rey. We wish to thank you 
for the work you are doing and for providing us with further 
information on the activities of the Cuban foreign minister and 
his retinue in Jakarta. This has a been a live, direct link with 
reporter Rey Rodriguez who is accompanying Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina Gonzalez through several Asian countries, 
beginning with Indonesia.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] We are standing in front of the U.S. Interests 
Section as a consequence of the publication today by the weekly 
JUVENTUD REBELDE of an article signed by Luis Baez Delgado. The 
article is entitled: "Sullivan, the CIA, and the Splinter 
Groups: Alliance To Fabricate Lies." It refers to a highly 
secret document issued by the U.S. Interests Section here in 
Havana. JUVENTUD REBELDE also published the full text of the 
document. 
  According to Baez Delgado, the document, which is addressed 
to the CIA among other addressees, is indisputable evidence not 
only of the lies and falsehoods dreamed up and disseminated 
against the Cuban Revolution, but also of the absolute 
cleanliness and justice that have always characterized us. 
  Baez Delgado adds that throughout the past 35 years Cuba has 
time and again stated that in this country there has never been 
a murdered, tortured, or missing citizen. This truth no one can 
deny, as no one can deny that here no one is under arrest for 
political reasons, but only for crimes against the Revolution, 
and that the so-called dissidents are only cheap CIA and U.S. 
Interests Section puppets. 
  According to the article, those who dedicate their lives to 
the ideas in which they believe neither persecute or imprison 
because of those ideas, as the CIA and the U.S. Interests 
Section have done. Those who believe in principles respect those 
principles. Those who fight for the dignity and honor of men 
will never be their executioners but will be their most faithful 
defenders. 
  Joseph Sullivan, head of the U.S. Interests Section, knows 
this very well, although he may dare to say so only secretly. 
Let us pay special attention to some of the sentences of this 
document, which, in ambiguous phrases, and considering the 
author and addressees, comes to an unavoidable conclusion: In 
Cuba there are no violations of human rights. This was not said 
by Fidel Castro; it was admitted by Joseph Sullivan. 
  The document includes unreliable cases, unverifiable 
documents or evidence, cases that are not congruous in certain 
aspects and which are of interest only to the United States. The 
general unreliability of the cases and the recognition of the 
economic rather than the political factor as the essential cause 
of emigration prove the above points. 
  The moral status of the members of those splinter groups 
stands out in the document. According to Baez Delgado, the 
leaders of those little groups peddle written guarantees like 
trinkets; they perpetrate fraud; they accuse one another and 
violate among themselves the most fundamental human rights, in 
addition to biting the hands that guide and feed them. 
  Moreover, Sullivan's document only adds further questions to 
the arguments that various U.S. Presidents have advanced all 
through these past years to intensify their policy of blockade 
against Cuba and makes the backward and ruthless individuals who 
are trying to defeat us through hunger look like liars. 
  According to the article, those who are trying to emigrate 
by 
entering embassies that happen to represent countries with which 
we have the best relations are also disappointed. No one with 
such objectives should violate the diplomatic missions of any 
country, much less if those embassies are not committed to any 
agreement to grant asylum. Among these candidates for 
emigration, none has had any political problem. The U.S. 
Interests Section document has finally unveiled this trick. 
  Sullivan's call to the CIA for help is very eloquent. The 
document states that given the expressed CIA interests in the 
human rights issue, and its growing participation in and growing 
knowledge of the different human rights groups, we suggest 
closer cooperation with the U.S. Interests Section in accordance 
with our common objectives. 
  This shows, Baez Delgado adds, that the police of the 
unipolar world have run out of steam and bullets. The moral 
bullets of the Revolution have once again demonstrated that they 
have a much longer range. The small island of Indians is once 
again giving a lesson to the North. Only a quarter of a century 
ago, they looked down on us; now they respect us. 
  On 28 June 1987, referring to the human rights issue and to 
the imperialist anti-Cuban campaign, Fidel Castro said: In our 
struggle against tyranny, we have been educated to repudiate and 
hate any use of violence against a prisoner; and those values 
have led us to victory. Those values have maintained us here, 
and history will see that this truth is written. 
  Baez Delgado ends his article by saying that history has 
once 
again proven that we are right and if, in their confusion or 
arrogance, the CIA, the State Department, the Immigration and 
Nationalization Service, and Sullivan himself deny the existence 
of the document and say that it was fabricated by the Cuban 
Government, they should be aware that the Revolution has never 
made up a document and that its honesty has always been 
irrefutable. 
  Caught redhanded, it is natural that their position is 
uncomfortable and embarrassing, Baez Delgado's article concludes.

  [Text] Facts dissipate doubts. While the world demands the 
end of economic and political genocide by the United States 
against Cuba, and while the United Nations calls for an end to 
retaliations, Deputy Secretary of State Alexander Watson [title 
as heard] requests democratic diversity, which is ironically 
dogmatic and orthodox, and which denies the Cuban people's right 
to diversity and pluralism. 
  Europe is beginning to discuss the decline of representative 
democracy by political parties, and Cuba, which has taken a step 
beyond with its rejuvenating political system and civil society, 
is unjustly described by government officials and other figures 
who speak to us today in a language that was buried in 1989 on 
the island of Malta. 
  This sad scenario has been chosen for their second-rate cast 
of characters who have been given indigestion by the fact that 
the Colombian Government and businessmen do not take what is 
being said in Miami about Cuba very seriously. The decision 
adopted by Bogota and Havana to negotiate the sale of between 
15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil under current commercial terms 
is judged in outdated, threatening terms and language. 
  Trade retaliations are being adopted against Colombian 
exports of flowers, barriers are erected against Colombian 
coffee, while the preparation of a black list of other Colombian 
products has also been announced. How long can one put up with 
such meddling in relations with third countries? Don't these 
events show that the blockade is a war of extraterritorial scale 
against Cuba? Why should we continue living under the sway of 
blacklists as if they were Damocles' sword. Of course any new 
factor attracts one's attention. 
  Representatives of the National Cuban-American Foundation in 
Bogota refused to endorse the boycott which was called by their 
own organization, while demonstrations in front of the Colombian 
consulate in Miami this past weekend were suspended for a lack 
of quorum. Moroever, it has been learned that a meeting of 
ultra-rightist immigrants for the establishment of joint actions 
has ended in a brouhaha. It just happens that those characters 
are the same ones who criticize the forthcoming meeting between 
the nation and its emigrants, and try to monopolize, for the 
benefit of their own pockets and treasuries, the positions of 
migrants toward their homeland. 
  I wish to ask the following question then: Would they submit 
to a plebiscite to truly verify whom they represent? Of course, 
Miami is not an essential goal for Colombian trade, only the 
port of entry for Colombian products to the United States. The 
Colombians, in turn, have said that they cannot submit their 
commercial policy to remarks from groups who are divorced from 
their country of origin. It would be extremely dramatic for the 
Colombians to have to ask permission from a group of Cubans from 
Miami in order to negotiate with whomever they want. 
  Thus, a defender of democratic diversity such as Mr. Watson 
should be worried about and dedicated to these violations of 
democratic diversity which are so similar to the covert and 
not-so-laudable wars of the civil and human rights movements of 
the civilized peoples, or has Mr. Watson perhaps become a 
hostage of prehistory?

[CEH] will go to Rome around 15 March reportedly to meet with 
Pope John II. Relations between the Aristide government and the 
Vatican have always been very strained. However, over the past 
weekend, President Aristide said he hopes for a coming together 
of his government and the Holy See. Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
labeled the contacts started last week between Vatican and his 
government a step in the right direction. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 7 Mar (EFE) -- Haitian military 
police today arrested the leader of a popular organization that 
supports exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Two policemen 
arrested Johnson Aristide of the grass-roots organization "Sun 
of Justice for the Liberation of the Haitian People" [Sol de la 
Justicia para la Liberacion del Pueblo Haitiano] while he 
attempted to deliver a press note to Radio Plus, a radio station 
in downtown Port-au- Prince, the Haitian press agency reported. 
  Aristide, who is not related to the president, was struck 
and 
forced into an automobile used by the police, the source 
informed. 
  Soldiers arrested several of President Aristide's supporters 
this weekend in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area. 
  Uniformed members of the military arrested Engineer Jacques 
Dorcean in the Thomassin area in eastern Port-au-Prince. 
Dorcean is a well-known supporter of the Lavalas Movement, 
which backed the exiled president in the December 1990 elections. 
  According to press reports, 20-year-old Val Maxime [not 
further identified] was also arrested and seriously beaten. 
  On Saturday, the home of Jean-Camille Calvin in Lillavois, 
an 
alleged Aristide follower, was strafed with machine-gun fire. 
Lillavois lives in northern Port-au-Prince. 
  So far the military has not released any information 
regarding the reason for the arrests.

  [Excerpts] The members of the Senate Office presided over 
by Firmin Jean-Louis returned to their offices in the Senate on 
7 March. This caused tension within the Senate. 
  Senator Bernard Sansaricq, president of the unofficial 
[Senate] office, promises to return to the attack via the law, 
with a view to taking back control of the Senate Office. The 
following is a report by Daly Valet: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] Firmin Jean-Louis, 
president of the normalized Senate-- who was in Washington -- 
has returned to Haiti. However, he did not return to the country 
just to stand by and and watch Bernard Sansaricq's unofficial 
Senate Office do it all. 
  Jean-Louis and Sen. Julio Larosiliere went into action very 
early on 7 March. They took back their offices, which were 
occupied by Bernard Sansaricq's team. 
  President Jean-Louis and Quaestor Larosiliere said, however, 
that they are not there to engage in confrontations; rather, 
they are there for reconciliation. This is why Sen. Larosiliere 
has proferred the olive branch to Sen. Sansaricq. Larosiliere 
also asked the parliamentarians elected in the 18 January 
elections to respect the New York pact, which they signed and 
which provided for them to refrain from attending Senate 
sessions while waiting for a solution to be found by the 
arbitration committee provided for in the Constitution. [passage 
omitted] 
  Jean-Louis and Larosiliere were not content with taking back 
control of the Senate. They have already announced that the 
Senate will meet in normal session on 8 March to work on the 
parliamentary plan for resolving the crisis. This plan has 
already passed the Chamber of Deputies. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, in the unofficial Senate Office, everybody is 
very 
angry. Sen. Sansaricq stated he would take back the presidency 
of the Senate using any and all means. For his part, Osny 
Eugene, quaestor of the unofficial office, has affirmed that 
Firmin Jean-Louis will be unable to hold sessions at the Senate. 
  [Unidentified journalist] Senator Sansaricq, since we see 
that Firmin Jean-Louis is there, will you go to your office this 
morning [7 March]? 
  [Sansaricq] I will take it back by any and all means. I have 
no further comments to make. Whether I take it back in 24 or in 
48 hours, we will restore the order we had established. You can 
write that down. 
  [Journalist] What strategy will you use: confrontation, 
force? 
  [Sansaricq] [Response indistinct] 
  [Journalist] Senator, are you ready to talk with the members 
of the other Office? Are you ready to engage in dialog or will 
you use force? 
  [Sansaricq] No comment. 
  [Journalist] So, you are ready for dialogue? 
  [Sansaricq] No comment. 
  [Journalist] [Words indistinct] compromise, Mr. President 
[of 
the Senate]? 
  [Sansaricq] No, no. No comment. 
  [Journalist] But, will you be in your office on 8 March? 
  [Sansaricq] No comment. I will be in my office. No comment. 
  [Journalist] Will you be conducting the session on 8 March? 
  [Sansaricq] We will use any means we must, but we will be in 
the office. 
  [Journalist] [Words indistinct] legal force, Senator? 
  [Sansaricq] Exactly. [passage omitted] 
  [Valet] Firmin Jean-Louis and Julio Larosiliere have taken 
back their offices at the Senate. Bernard Sansaricq and Osny 
Eugene are angry. Senators Serge Joseph and Romel Manigat, for 
their part, have gun and rifle in hand. The Senate of the 
Republic has become a stage. This is Daly Valet for Signal FM.

<F P=106> [By Edwige Balutansky] </F>
  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 8 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Today with the 
support of military men and armed civilians, pro-military 
senators barred administrative personnel from entering the 
Senate. Bernard Sansaricq, who proclaimed himself president of 
the Haitian Senate on 4 February, led the operation to prevent 
Senate leaders who oppose the military government from taking 
their seats. 
  According to Radio Metropole, military men occupied the 
Senate and shots were heard in the area surrounding the 
legislative building in Port-au-Prince. Armed civilians 
surrounded the building and were arresting people who opposed 
pro-coupist parliamentarians. No information on the number of 
people detained or their whereabouts is available. 
  Political observers think the coupists found a way to "close 
off" the Senate, an objective which has been announced many 
times by those who oppose President Jean Bertrand Aristide's 
return. Senate President Farmin Jean Louis, who was elected in 
the negotiations supervised by the international community in 
August 1993, was in Washington on a State Department invitation 
for a new round of talks when he was deposed. Jean Louis and the 
other senators who rejected the views of Sansaricq and his 
followers, left the parliament because of death threats against 
them. This Monday, Jean Louis and Senator Julio Larosilliere, 
who was in Washington also, arrived at the Senate for the first 
time since their return and announced their determination to 
reoccupy their seats. 
  Diplomats in Port-au-Prince have said that the international 
community does not know who the senators led by Sansaricq are, 
considering that Jean Louis' mandate is still effective. 
  Several Haitian women's organizations took advantage of the 
commemoration of International Women's Day on Tuesday to express 
their dissatisfaction with UNICEF, an organization that, they 
say, has remained silent on the abuses perpetrated against them 
by the coupist military.

  [Text] The appearance of contradictions within the National 
Front for Change and Democracy, FNCD, is normal, said 
Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul during an interview with the 
information service of the Research and Action Center for 
Development [Centre de Recherches et d'Actions pour le 
Developpment, CRAD]. A copy of this interview reached the 
Haitian press agency. 
  After admitting that there has been a weakening of the front 
in the Chamber of Deputies, Paul asserted that dialogue could 
resolve the conflicts that have arisen within the front, to 
avoid social explosion [corrects himself] sorry, total 
explosion. He added that divergences within the FNCD are the 
product of circumstance, and could be easily resolved. In his 
opinion, the proposal voted as a resolution in the Lower Chamber 
must be analyzed and tailored to the stance expressed by 
President Aristide, whose views must be taken into account in 
order to reach a compromise. 
  Paul explained that FNCD's stance has not changed since 16 
February, when it rejected the appointment of a puppet prime 
minister. In conclusion, Paul invites all sectors to express 
unity so the solution to the crisis does not come exclusively 
from the United Nations or the four countries called, Friends of 
Haiti.

<F P=106> [Interview with President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide by </F>
O GLOBO Correspondent Deborah Berlinck in Geneva; date not given] 
  [Text] [Berlinck] Since you were exiled from Haiti in 1991, 
Mr. President, every diplomatic way to reinstate you in office 
was attempted -- a countless number of negotiations, embargoes 
on trade with Haiti. Do you think that foreign military 
intervention will be necessary? 
  [Aristide] If 67 percent of the Haitian people voted for me 
three years ago, more than 90 percent of Haitians are at present 
requesting my reinstatement as president. Despite the more than 
100,000 murders perpetrated by the military, the Haitian people 
are determined to continue struggling for their dignity and the 
defense of their rights. The international community ought to 
express more clearly its political will to support us. The 
trade embargo is not enough to oblige military putschists to 
hand over power. 
  [Berlinck] What do you expect, Mr. President? An American 
military intervention? 
  [Aristide] We do not need a military intervention but rather 
a show of political will by those who claim to be our friends. 
Democracy in Haiti will not just rain down from heaven, you know. 
  [Berlinck] The United States has crossed Haiti off its list 
of foreign policy priorities. Why has the United States 
abandoned you? 
  [Aristide] Haiti's fate will be defined by the Haitian 
people, and not by others. Haiti is a country that presently 
has an 80-percent illiteracy rate. But fortunately, illiterate 
people are not morons -- they manifest their intelligence with 
courage. We are struggling to impose the rule of law in our 
country without expecting a solution from others. The solution 
will have to stem from our struggle. 
  [Berlinck] To what extent are you willing to negotiate with 
the military about your reinstatement as Haitian president? 
  [Aristide] We are Haiti. And when I say us, I do not refer 
only to myself. We are not fighting for power only; we are 
fighting to establish democracy in our country. If the 
international community respects its commitment to the agreement 
(which provided for his reinstatement in office last December, 
but which was not honored by the military), the people will 
become involved. 
  [Berlinck] And if the military were to impose as a condition 
holding new elections? 
  [Aristide] No, the people have already decided and their 
will 
must be respected. We will be flexible in our answer, and we 
will respond with dignity in the face of complicity. Last 
January, four countries that claim to be our friends issued an 
ultimatum to the military to step down from power lest they 
should impose more sanctions against Haiti. And what has come 
of it? Or is there complicity in this affair? 
  [Berlinck] The military insist that an amnesty be declared 
for them. 
  [Aristide] The agreement signed last year includes a 
political amnesty for the military. That provision was honored. 
We have done everything possible for the agreement and the 
military will have to step down. I spent hours thinking about 
the agreement last July before signing it because I was 
convinced that this strategy of co-existence with the military 
would lead us to annihilation. They assassinated our justice 
minister. How many more ministers do we have to lose? If there 
is international complicity, the military will demand other 
concessions. 
  [Berlinck] Are you then ready to wait in exile as long as 
necessary until you can be reinstated as president under your 
own conditions, Mr. President? 
  [Aristide] I am ready to continue fighting with my people. 
Power for power's sake can only lead to corruption and Leonardo 
Boff [a lifelong advocate of the Theology of Liberation] has 
already warned about this. We want to institute the rule of law 
and our time in exile ought to contribute to making our 
historical progress toward that objective fruitful. 
  [Berlinck] What would you do, Mr. President, to reestablish 
order in your country if you were reinstated as president now? 
  [Aristide] While not encouraging revenge, I would try to put 
an end to impunity. I am in favor of a reconciliation process 
based on justice. Our country is at present like a broken vase 
-- we must pick up the fragments and piece them together once 
again. 
  [Berlinck] What do you expect of the United Nations Mr. 
President? 
  [Aristide] I expect that the United Nations may save face 
because a failure of its endeavors in Haiti will spell the end 
of its credibility. 
  [Berlinck] Do you feel that Latin American governments 
support you, Mr. President? 
  [Aristide] Yes, I do. When I was in Brazil, I felt that 
Brazilians showed solidarity with Haitian people because deep 
down we have similar problems. I found friends like Leonardo 
Boff, who wrote the foreword for my latest book. I look to the 
future with optimism when I see the dynamic force of Third World 
countries, of Brazil, of Haiti.

  [Text] The first news report is on the statements made on 7 
March in the United States by the U.S. Government regarding 
President Aristide's rejection of the crisis settlement plan. 
The U.S. Administration termed very regretable the exiled 
president's rejection of the plan to settle the crisis presented 
by Haitian legislators. Rothschild Francois reports: 
  [Francois] It is very regrettable that President Aristide 
rejected the offer of cooperation that the UN secretary general 
made to him -- said U.S. State Department spokesperson Christine 
Shelly. 
  The plan, actively backed by the United States and approved 
last week by the Chamber of Deputies in Port-au-Prince, provides 
for a new prime minister to take office following an early 
retirement by General Cedras but does not set a date for 
President Aristide's return to Port-au-Prince. The president was 
very firm on Saturday [5 March] in refusing this plan, because 
of what he called a lack of will and political cynicism on the 
part of the big western nations toward his return to power. He 
placed particular blame on the United States, whose policy of 
ambiguity toward him he denounced. 
  According to Mr. Aristide, there is no solution possible 
outside of the framework of the Governors Island agreement, 
signed in New York last July. This agreement provided for the 
overthrown president to return on 30 October 1993 and for the 
military authors of the 30 September 1991 coup d'etat to step 
down before that date. 
  The State Department spokesperson added: Our viewpoint is 
that the plan includes the key elements that are part of the 
agreement and of the Governors Island accord process. We are 
aware of President Aristide's criticism but we continue to think 
that the plan offers the best possibilities for ending the 
crisis in Haiti.

  [Text] On 25 February, President Itamar Franco promulgated 
the all-encompassing nuclear safeguard agreement signed in 
December 1991 by Brazil, Argentina, the Brazilian-Argentine 
Agency for Accounting and Control (ABACC), and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA). The decree's single paragraph, 
signed by Franco, reads: "Any modifications to the subsidiary 
agreements and acts that may entail the revision of this 
agreement, as well as any acts that, according to the terms of 
Article No. 49, clause No. 1, of the federal Constitution, may 
entail demands or burdensome commitments on the national economy 
will be subject to the approval of the national Congress." 
  This paragraph was included at the request of Senator Dirceu 
Carneiro (PSDB-SC [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Santa 
Catarina]), who coordinated the agreement. 
  The agreement's main purpose is that the member states 
"accept the application of safeguards for all nuclear materiel 
used in all nuclear activities carried out within their 
respective territory, under their jurisdiction or their control 
at any site, with the sole purpose of assuring that the materiel 
not be used to produce nuclear weapons or other explosive 
nuclear devices." 
  The agreement contains 98 articles and refers to the 
implementation of safeguards, the supply of information to the 
agency, inspectors' privileges and immunity, a common accounting 
and control system for nuclear materiel, subsidiary agreements, 
and the scope of inspections, among other issues. 
  As for the subsidiary agreements, the most polemic subject 
during the agreement's debate by the Senate Foreign Affairs 
Committee, the agreement states: "Considering the accounting 
and control system, the ABACC, the interested member states, and 
the agency will reach detailed subsidiary agreements that will 
allow the agency to efficiently fulfill its duties specified in 
the current agreement."

<F P=106> [From the "Political Panorama" column by Tereza Cruvinel] </F>
  [Text] Leaving the Finance Ministry and the administration 
of the economic plan is no longer a problem for the candidacy of 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Everyone seems to agree on this. 
When Cardoso promises to reflect on the subject before deciding 
(even if he has already done so), he and his allies are 
demonstrating that they are now mainly concerned over political 
and electoral subjects pertaining his candidacy. 
  The first variable is the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party]. Cautious PSDB leader Jose Serra has said that two 
thirds of the party want Cardoso to be a candidate. On 8 March, 
during a meeting with PSDB bloc members, Cardoso will hear 
claims in favor of his candidacy. But it is one thing to run as 
an autonomous candidate, and something else to discuss an 
alliance with other parties. That is what holds back the 
remaining third of the PSDB. 
  If on the one hand the policy of alliances disturbs the 
PSDB, 
on the other Cardoso and the PSDB leaders know that the power of 
his candidacy is directly related to his ability to obtain 
support. The non-orthodox wing of the Workers Party [PT] has 
said that Lula [PT leader Luis Inacio da Silva] is desperate 
because he is unable to make more alliances. Cardoso rules out 
any alliance with the left. The field that lies before him 
ranges from the center to the right, and that is where the 
dilemmas begin. 
  According to one PSDB leader, a possible alliance with the 
PFL [Liberal Front Party] should be evaluated with extreme care. 
If on the one hand an alliance will bring PSDB electoral 
advantages -- like a presence in northeastern Brazil and 
heavyweight allies, beside the approval of the elites -- on the 
other hand it will chase away Bahia politicians like Waldir 
Pires, who would never stand on the platform beside [Bahia 
Governor and PFL leader] Antonio Carlos Magalhaes. But the 
problem not only lies in Bahia. In Santa Catarina, PSDB 
candidate for governor Jaison Barreto is endorsed by the PT, his 
candidacy was launched by Lula, and he is running against PFL 
President Jorge Bornhausen. But the greatest problem is in Sao 
Paulo where [PSDB Senator] Mario Covas cannot be simply trampled 
into the dirt. 
  PSDB leaders do not overlook the fact that Cardoso is not a 
purebred PSDB member, and as such he could obtain broader 
support than just from the PFL. It would not be very 
troublesome for the PP [Popular Party] of Alvaro Dias to join 
the PSDB (once the disagreements in Parana State between Dias 
and PSDB Senator Jose Richa are overcome). To further stress 
the center-right leaning, it would be essential to obtain the 
support of the PMDB [Brazilian Social Democratic Party] wing 
that will not support Orestes Quercia if he wins the party 
convention. PMDB dissidents, especially those from Rio Grande 
do Sul -- whose spokesman is [PMDB Senator] Pedro Simon -- 
dislike the idea of a possible coalition with the PFL. Their 
alternative, for regional considerations, is to support the PDT 
[Democratic Labor Party]. 
  All this must be considered and discussed during the next 
three weeks.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "To Serve </F>
the Country Until the End"] 
  [Text] While the stock exchanges reflected a bull market 
following the announcement of the economic plan's new stage, 
another kind of speculation took place in Brasilia about who 
could replace Finance and Economy Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso in his post. The point is that since it is thought that 
Cardoso will be nominated as a presidential candidate by his 
party, it is reasonable to begin speculating on who will 
administer the economic plan. The difference between the stock 
exchanges and the speculations in Brasilia is that in the former 
ones investors are concerned with gaining or losing cruzeiros 
based on real assets; while in the latter case the players are 
making speculations without knowing the balance that the auditor 
of "Brazil company" (that is, the president of the Republic) 
will present, and exerting pressure on Mr. Itamar Franco, 
through daring bids, to make him accept either this or that 
candidate who appeals most to the new-style technocrats or the 
new-generation politicians. As always, Brasilia does not live in 
the real world. While the politicians debate whether a minister 
is leaving to become a candidate, they forget that the economic 
plan's success lies mainly in the credibility given to it by the 
economic agents. It is evident that in the past few months such 
credibility was not given to the economic team as a whole, but 
to the finance minister. We are not trying to discredit the 
university professors that counsel Minister Cardoso, but the 
truth cannot be hidden. There is only one truth: After defeating 
resistance inside and outside the administration, after scoring 
accomplishments and consenting to minor defeats on several 
fronts, Cardoso is the indicated person to administer the 
economic plan, which is a much more difficult task than creating 
it because he will have to confront the labor unions, the price 
increases that can be considered sabotage, the temptation to 
call on the "old lady" (Sunab [National Supply Superintendency]) 
to control whether prices are within the average increases of 
the previous four months or if there have been abusive hikes, 
and those who think it is much easier to freeze prices than to 
live with the market fluctuations. 
  Even understanding that the party leaders keep an eye on the 
presidential race, we cannot forget that the defense of the 
economic plan's rational part will allow the presidential race 
-- which has great political and social meaning -- to develop 
normally. A failure of the economic plan will affect the 
electoral atmosphere in such a way that the election campaign 
will become a real "battle" (in the past, candidates simply ran 
for elections); a success in the economic plan, even if partial, 
will make the attacks the candidates will throw at each other at 
least civilized, as expected by the public. A failure will 
mainly favor those who fish in troubled waters, while a success 
will favor those who defend democratic normalcy. 
  Speculations about who will replace the finance minister 
only 
help wear out the economic plan. How many people used to 
ironically say before Provisional Measure No. 434 was published 
that the plan would be a great election campaign? How many 
politicians disapproved the provisional measure in case Minister 
Cardoso left his post, called by the PSDB [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party] to run against Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva? 
However, if the minister leaves his post to become a 
presidential candidate, the public will believe the economic 
plan had electoral purposes; consequently, it will be easy to 
discredit the economic plan, something that will benefit a few 
speculators in the stock exchanges or in other alternative 
circles like in the campaign to discredit the regime. To suppose 
that the execution of the economic plan will be the same without 
Minister Cardoso is to be extremely naive. For months Minister 
Cardoso worked hard on the most difficult part of his task, 
which was to convince President Itamar Franco not to break 
contracts or impose a price freeze. This was possible thanks 
only to the personality of Minister Cardoso and his undeniable 
influence on the chief of state. Whoever was to replace the 
finance minister, no matter how much political support he may 
have, would have to go through the daily ordeal of first 
convincing his aides and then the president himself to impose 
his views, without being sure of having the same prestige as his 
predecessor. Once outside the government, it will be useless for 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso to try to influence President Itamar 
Franco or his Juiz de Fora intimate circle. Whoever goes 
outside, remains outside. When accepting President Itamar 
Franco's invitation to become finance minister, Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso knew he made a choice deep down: to postpone 
his personal political plans, replacing them with the valuable 
task of re-establishing the country's confidence in its 
currency. Now, he must stick with this task until the end, under 
the penalty of becoming another former finance minister who 
gives his opinion about his successors' savior economic plans in 
the future.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 8 Mar (EFE) -- Luis Inacio "Lula" da 
Silva, the Brazilian socialist leader who is hoping to be 
elected president of his country in the 3 October elections, 
today stated that if he wins the elections he will fight to put 
an end to the trade blockade imposed on Cuba. 
  Lula, a 48-year-old lathe operator and union leader, told 
foreign correspondents in a news conference that "if we win the 
presidential elections, we will fight hard to promote respect 
for Cuba and to help it overcome the blockade that is isolating 
it from the rest of the world." 
  Endorsing the Cuban people's right to resolve their 
difficult 
economic and political problems on their own, Lula said: "The 
Cubans have the right to decide their future free from foreign 
interference." 
  Lula, who for one year has enjoyed the preference of 30 
percent of the voters in opinion polls, stated that he would 
like to see Cuba experience a political opening. He made it 
clear, however, that he would refrain from making any proposal 
to this effect out of respect for the Cuban people's 
independence. 
  Lula, who is the leader of the Workers Party [PT], said: 
"Although I would like to see elections and a political opening 
in Cuba, I am respectful of the free determination of the Cuban 
people." 
  "My criticism of Fidel (Castro) is a respectful one 
addressed 
to a comrade who, because of external pressure, has been unable 
to prove that his system can work," Lula said. 
  The PT is a party consisting of sectors ranging from 
ultraleftist to social democratic moderate factions. The PT 
leader acknowledges that since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, 
socialism is no longer seeking to put an end to capitalism.

<F P=106> [Article by Lucia Helena Gazzola] </F>
  [Text] The PT [Workers Party] has decided to change its 
electoral strategy in light of the possible presidential 
candidacy of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. 
Following a meeting that lasted all weekend, the party national 
board yesterday released three documents attacking the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party], which had been a desirable 
ally in the past. The three documents are: A strongly worded 
note that excludes Cardoso's ticket from the PT policy of 
alliances; an open letter to PSDB grassroots and voters asking 
for support for Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's candidacy; and a 
note criticizing the economic plan. 
  The note that excludes the PSDB from the list of possible 
allies, which was approved by a 35-to-9 vote, charges the PSDB 
leadership with "opposing PSDB democratic demands, becoming a 
group allied with conservative sectors, and becoming a political 
alternative to sponsor an anti-Lula candidate." 
  The open letter addressed to PSDB grassroots follows the 
same 
line. It states: "Despite our efforts, the main PSDB leaders 
have approached the perpetual partners of power, who cluster 
around the PFL [Liberal Front Party] of Antonio Carlos 
Magalhaes. The continuity of this alternative give a neatly 
conservative touch to the party." It adds: "Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso's name is being put at the service of conservative 
elites as the only alternative to face the reform movement 
represented by Lula's candidacy." The letter calls on PSDB 
members to prevent the party from "heading a conservative 
coalition" and calls on them to join Lula's campaign. 
  In the third document, which opposes the economic plan, the 
PT assures that the plan is "an ongoing electoral fraud led by 
the same Cruzado plan team." The document also attacks Cardoso, 
saying: "That is the context within which he obtained his only 
victory through a vote." The Radical Democracy, led by Sao Paulo 
Deputy Jose Genoino, was the only PT movement that disagreed 
with excluding the PSDB from the policy of alliances. 
"Narrowing the scope of the policy of alliances will reduce the 
conditions of governability of the future Lula government," he 
criticized. 
  At another meeting, the state PT board yesterday decided to 
rule out the possibility of forming a coalition with the PSDB 
for the election in Sao Paulo. The board also debated on Deputy 
Jose Dirceu's campaign for governor, and nominated former 
Prefects Luiza Erundina and Telma de Souza as candidates for the 
Senate. 
  On Saturday evening, the national PT board allowed PT 
lawmakers to participate in the constitutional reform. The 
victory of the party bloc, which disagreed with the prohibition 
imposed by party leaders, was by 33 votes against 19, and marked 
the defeat of party radicals. 
  Lula, the virtual PT presidential candidate, yesterday 
criticized PSDB President Tasso Jereissati and Finance Minister 
Cardoso. Lula said Jereissati was "relapsing on conservatism, 
neoliberalism, and backwardness," because his party approached 
the PFL. Lula said he laments that Cardoso "is not interested 
in debating a progressive solution for Brazil." 
  Lula claims that the PSDB is abandoning social democracy. 
"It is deeply lamentable that Jereissati, who began his 
political career by breaking the rule of bosses who dominated 
the northeast, should now have this conservative syndrome, 
seeking an alliance with the retrograde PFL, the party of Jorge 
Bornhausen, Ricardo Fiuza, Marco Maciel, Antonio Carlos 
Magalhaes, and Joaquim Francisco," Lula said before comparing 
Jereissati's behavior with a sickness. "It is a dangerous 
relapse. It is necessary to find a vaccine because the 
epidemics is serious." 
  Lula admitted that the PT is concerned about Cardoso's 
possible candidacy: "At a time when we can decide whether to put 
the destiny of the country in conservative or progressive hands, 
they chose the former." He said PSDB members will not agree to 
a coalition with Bornhausen's party. "The grassroots, who in 
1990 prevented the party from falling into Collor's hands, will 
now prevent it from falling into PFL hands."

  [Excerpt] Sao Luis, Maranhao State -- Former President Jose 
Sarney, who already occupies second place in the electoral 
polls, is the first candidate to retire from this year's 
presidential race. "I am out of this contest," Sarney said on 28 
February after returning to his house on Calhau Beach to recover 
from a tachycardia crisis that forced him to go to the hospital 
during the weekend. Surrounded by his relatives and wearing a 
safari shirt and leather sandals, the former president decided 
to extend his rest for a few more days and postpone his return 
to Brasilia until 1 March. 
  The former president did not attribute to his heart problem 
the decision to give up the presidential campaign. Sarney is a 
Brazilian Democratic Movement Party senator for Amapa State. He 
said he has "never" wanted to return to Planalto Palace. 
Justifying the fact that his name is always in evidence, he 
said: "Politicians talk too much." Sarney's decision not to run 
for the presidency, however, was ignored even by the newspaper 
he owns. Before the former president was hospitalized, the 
ESTADO DO MARANHAO daily published in big letters a note stating 
that the Liberal Front Party governors believed Sarney would be 
"the strongest and most talked about" presidential candidate.

  [Text] More than $1 million in counterfeit bills printed in 
Colombia are being distributed nationwide. The size, color, and 
type of printing of these bills are the best ever found in 
Brazil. No fake dollars previously found in the country are so 
similar to real dollar bills. Federal Police experts are 
impressed. The 1,000 bills of $100 seized at Manaus 
International Airport even have metal protection bands. 
  Former mason Astenio Nunes de Souza and businessman Juarez 
de 
Paula Sobrinho, who live in Manaus, confessed to buying the 
counterfeit bills in Colombia to sell them in Belem, Para State; 
Rio de Janeiro; and Sao Paulo. 
  Federal Police already are convinced that the dollar bills 
are being printed in Colombia because counterfeiting is only 
considered a crime in that country when counterfeit Colombian 
money is printed. To print any other counterfeit currency is 
only a misdemeanor and the counterfeiter can, at most, be fined 
for doing it. 
  For that reason, Federal Police today sent Colombian 
authorities an official letter calling for an urgent 
investigation, particularly in Leticia, which is a town 
separated from Brazil by nothing but a street. 
  At Tabatinga, on the Brazilian side, Federal Police have 
reinforced border controls. On this side of the border, buying 
or selling counterfeit dollars can result in five years in jail.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergio Torres] </F>
  [Text] Brazilian cocaine and marijuana for Russian rifles, 
machine guns, bombs, and ammunition. This exchange is allegedly 
being negotiated by Rio de Janeiro drug traffickers and African 
guerrilla elements who, since the 1970's, have received weapons 
manufactured in the former USSR. This week the Rio de Janeiro 
PF (Federal Police) started to investigate the relationship 
between Brazilian drug traffickers and African guerrilla 
elements. 
  Rio de Janeiro PF Superintendent Edson Antonio de Oliveira, 
42, said the suspicion regarding the exchange of drugs for 
weapons surfaced with the confiscation in Rio de Janeiro 
shantytowns of ammunition made in the former USSR member 
countries. 
  The occupation of the Mangueira shantytown (in northern Rio 
de Janeiro) by agents of the Civil and Military Police early 
this week interrupted the "war" between drug rings that has 
already resulted in 14 deaths, and the seizing of Russian-made 
AK-47 Kalashnikov rifle shells. This rifle can fire up to 800 
shots per minute. 
  Oliveira said that the foreign weapons acquired by the Rio 
de 
Janeiro drug traffickers usually come via Miami (United States) 
and Paraguay. The superintendent asserted: "Russian weapons do 
not come through these two routes because this type of weapon or 
ammunition do not exist in Miami or Paraguay." 
  The PF investigations have shown that the Russian weapons 
may 
be coming from Africa through the Middle East and Asian 
countries such as Afghanistan, that have overcome difficult 
phases of regional wars and battles. 
  Oliveira commented: "Russian weapons are cheaper because 
there are great quantities of them in African countries in 
conflict and in Lebanon. We are greatly concerned. As soon as 
these conflicts are over, the excess weapons are put up for 
sale." 
  The contacts between Rio de Janeiro underground 
organizations 
and terrorists of countries such as Angola, Namibia, and Zaire 
may be being made by Africans who enter Brazil as tourists. 
  A new route for the international trafficking of weapons may 
be being established the same way as Africans acted as middlemen 
for the shipment of cocaine from Brazil to Europe -- the 
Nigerian connection. 
  Since the 1980's Rio de Janeiro represents a sort of 
supermarket for the population of poor African countries. 
Thousands of Angolans, Nigerians, Zairians, and Ghanaians come 
to Rio de Janeiro every year as tourists and return loaded with 
all sorts of merchandise (from sandals to electrical appliances). 
  The PF is investigating whether these tourists are not 
representatives of guerrilla organizations, in charge of 
maintaining contact with Rio de Janeiro criminal organizations 
such as the CV (Red Commando) and the TC (Third Commando). 
  Groups of policemen specialize in supplying drugs and 
foreign 
weapons to drug traffickers linked to the CV and TC. Parallel 
investigations carried out by the Civil and Federal Police came 
to the same conclusion. 
  The DRE (Drug Control Precinct) of the Civil Police has 
identified groups of suppliers made up of civil, military, and 
federal agents. These groups sell sophisticated weapons that 
usually arrive in Rio de Janeiro through the international 
airport (northern zone), on their way to the drug traffickers. 
  One of the groups of suppliers is allegedly headed by Civil 
Police Detective Cesar Pereira da Silva. DRE Director Walter 
Alves de Oliveira, 54, said the group sold weapons and drugs to 
Orlando da Conceicao, or Orlando Jogador, who is regarded by the 
police as one of the biggest drug traffickers in Rio de Janeiro. 
Jogador has cocaine and marijuana "sale spots" in the 
Bonsucesso, Penha, and Ramos shantytowns in northern Rio de 
Janeiro. Pereira da Silva was arrested last December.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Attorney General's Office of the Republic [PGR] 
today remanded 16 people, including officials of the Baja 
California Attorney General's Office and suspected drug 
trafficker Higuera Guerrero. They are allegedly responsible for 
the shoot-out in Tijuana on Thursday [3 March] during which a 
Federal Judicial Police [PJF] commander, his assistant, and 
three other people were killed. 
  Agents of the state judicial police in Baja California, who 
were protecting drug traffickers, were responsible for the 
shoot-out with members of the PJF in Tijuana. In the shoot-out, 
Alejandro Castaneda Andrade, commander of the special group of 
the PJF in Tijuana; Salvador Miramontes Torres, agent of the 
state judicial police; Rayad Abdul Shedar, a Lebanese-origin 
professional criminal working for drug traffickers; and an 
unidentified individual were killed and five people were wounded. 
  Regarding this incident, which occurred on 3 March at Felix 
Gomez Street and Diaz Ordaz Boulevard in La Mesa District in 
Tijuana, Alfonso Cabrera Morales, deputy attorney general for 
districts and subdistricts of the PGR, issued the results of the 
investigations. He said the participation of some members of the 
state judicial police in the shoot-out has been proven. The 
motive for the shoot-out was the fact that the state judicial 
policemen were protecting Isamel Higuera Guerrero, alias El 
Mayel, a lieutenant of the Arellano Felix brothers, when he was 
going to be arrested by the PJF. The state judicial policemen 
attacked the PJF members, and in the shoot-out drug trafficker 
Ismael Higuera Guerrero was able to escape. He has been 
identified as the individual who has inherited control of drug 
trafficking in Tijuana as a result of the search for the 
Arellano Felix brothers. 
  Eleven [number as heard] individuals identified as people at 
the service of the Baja California Attorney General's Office 
have been remanded. These include Sergio Ortiz Lara, deputy 
state attorney general [subprocurador de justicia del estado] in 
Tijuana, and Juan Carlos Guerrero, agent of the Attorney 
General's Office for the court of equity [agente del ministerio 
publico del fuero comun]. They are accused of abuse of 
authority, aiding the mass escape of prisoners, and crimes 
against the administration of justice. They are both free as 
they filed amparos when they appeared to make their statements. 
Arrest warrants have been issued for five group leaders of the 
state judicial police and the operational commander of the 
Tijuana municipal police for the same crime [not further 
specified].

<F P=106> [Report by Jaime Flores in Baja California State; from the </F>
"ACIR Radio News" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Flores] At noon, Juan Francisco Franco Rios, 
attorney general for Baja California State, announced a total 
reorganization of the Baja California Judicial Police. This is 
what he said: 
  [Begin Rios recording] In 15 days, we will totally 
reorganize 
the state's Judicial Police. When I say totally, I mean the 
absolute and complete reorganization relating to the actions and 
conduct of Judicial Police members. [end recording] 
  At a news conference, the state attorney general said that 
bad policemen will be dismissed immediately, especially those 
who took part in Thursday's shoot-out, here in Tijuana, where 
Federal Judicial Police Commander Salvador Miramontes Torres 
died, federal policeman Juan Jesus Hernandez Tejeda was 
seriously wounded, and a state policeman was also killed. 
  Franco Rios reiterated that the investigation continues so 
as 
to supply the judge handling the case with the most evidence so 
he can best ascertain the responsibility of the policemen 
involved as well as the involvement of Tijuana Assistant 
Attorney General Sergio Ortiz Lara and the group leaders named 
by the Attorney General's Office. 
  The attorney general said that many of these policemen went 
to the scene of the shoot-out to do their duty but their names 
are listed in the case. He also said that on Monday two agents 
from Attorney General's Office in Ensenada and Mexicali arrived 
here in Tijuana to continue the case and to clarify which agents 
are involved in drug trafficking. Finally, Deputy Alejandro 
Monraz called for the creation of a special Prosecutor's Office, 
with no connection with the state Attorney General's Office, to 
investigate Thursday night's shoot-out in La Mesa area, where 
four people were killed and eight, wounded. 
  [Announcer] I asked you if this is in response to the 
Thursday shoot-out? 
  [Flores] Yes, of course. The Attorney General's Office held 
a 
news conference on Sunday here in Tijuana. It was learned that 
there is a direct connection between the shoot-out and State 
Judicial Police. Many of them are at the state Attorney 
General's Office right now. No arrests warrants have been issued 
yet, even though many were detained. At least three group 
leaders are accused of being involved in the shoot-out, 
especially as bodyguards of a lieutenant working for the 
Arellano Felix brothers. They said they sold protection to the 
lieutenant.

<F P=106> [First of "several" installments of a report by Raul </F>
Rodriguez on an interview with Subcommander Marcos, spokesman 
for the Zapatist National Liberation Army, EZLN, by Television 
Azteca special correspondent Francisco Rubio; place and date not 
given; from the "First Thing in the Morning" newscast -- 
passages within quotation marks are recorded] 
  [Text] In Chiapas, dialogue has been chosen over force. 
However, in developing this strategy, which benefits the 
country, the respect for the state of law has not been strictly 
observed. Subcommander Marcos himself addressed the issue in an 
exclusive interview by Francisco Rubio, special correspondent 
for Television Azteca, just before leaving for the mountains to 
meet with the Indian communities. He addressed the paradox 
regarding the legality of the illegality of the negotiation 
process, the authority of those who discussed the issues, and 
the legal validity of the resulting agreements. 
  [Marcos] "It is a paradox. Two people who do not exist are 
talking. On the one side there is a commissioner who does not 
legally exist. On the other, there is a Zapatist National 
Liberation Army [EZLN] that does not legally exist either. 
Furthermore, there is an intermediary who does not legally exist 
either. This, legally speaking, is all science fiction." 
  [Constitutional law expert Ignacio Burgos] "The so-called 
Marcos is an unknown individual. He is an enigma. No one knows 
who he is. He says he represents the indigenous peoples of 
Chiapas State, but that representation remains unproven. On the 
other hand we have Camacho Solis who appointed himself the 
commissioner for peace. He has not been invested with any sort 
of authority because he does not represent the Mexican 
president, the state, or the government." 
  Other specialists and experts, without contradicting the 
law, 
express the opposite. 
  [Raul Carranca y Rivas, of the National Autonomous 
University 
of Mexico Law School] "The government, Subcommander Marcos, and 
Marcos' followers accepted this ideological confrontation, where 
talks are the main element. Given these circumstances, the 
process gains its legal status. What I mean is that two parties 
meet by mutual accord to resolve ideological conflicts, to reach 
conclusions, and to find agreements. This is an agreement in 
itself, which we could call legal." 
  However, what can be said about the validity and binding 
nature of the agreements? 
  [Marcos] "The agreements we can reach here are quite fragile 
no matter from what angle one looks at them. The person signing 
for one party does not have the authority necessary; not one 
single group has authorized him to do so. The person signing 
for the other party is nothing more than a ski mask with a 
pseudonym." 
  [Carranca y Rivas] "As long as Mr. Camacho has the blessing 
of the president and Marcos has the blessing of his people, they 
automatically become legal agreeing parties." 
  According to Commissioner Camacho, federal and state 
government officials will sign the agreements in San Cristobal. 
Riding on that fact is the validity and the binding authority 
the agreements will enjoy.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 8 Mar (DPA) -- 
Today, the police violently evicted Indian peasants from four 
tracts of land they had occupied several days earlier in the 
northern area of San Cristobal de las Casas, in the convulsed 
southern state of Chiapas. Witnesses reported that the police 
arrested some 20 Indians and stole some of the squatters' 
belongings, like television sets, radio recorders, and kitchen 
ware. 
  The Indian peasants' eviction from land plots is one of the 
demands included in an extensive petition presented yesterday by 
the Citizens' Front for the Defense of San Cristobal, composed 
of this Chiapas city's influential and wealthy people. 
Nevertheless, today, the group, headed by San Cristobal Mayor 
Jorge Mario Lescieur Talavera, told Chiapas Governor Javier 
Lopez Moreno of their decision to waive their demands, which 
included the expulsion of Bishop Samuel Ruiz, mediator between 
the government and the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]. 
  Among other things, the Citizens' Front demanded that San 
Cristobal de las Casas stop hosting the peace talks between the 
government and the EZLN and that all the catechists and priests 
who promoted the theology of liberation, whom the Citizens' 
Front had accused of "masterminding" the guerrilla movement, 
leave town. They also demanded the Catholic churches be 
temporarily closed. They regard the churches as centers for 
"aiding and abetting crime." In addition, the Citizens' Front 
demanded the expulsion of nongovernment organizations and the 
boycott of independent newspapers in the capital and San 
Cristobal, which they had accused of being EZLN mouthpieces. 
  The demands were presented in response to the mobilization 
of 
peasant and Indian groups demanding land and public services; 
demands that culminated in the occupation of several mayor's 
offices in Chiapas as a consequence of the Zapatist rebellion 
which broke out on 1 January. 
  In praising the decision of the Citizens' Front to waive its 
demands, Governor Moreno warned, however, that legal orders will 
be enforced against those who have invaded land tracts and 
municipal buildings.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 6 
March 1994. 
  Fernando Cortina Legarreta, president of the Confederation 
of 
Industrial Chambers, has said the economy's "slow" growth rate 
will have little impact on job creation, illustrated by the fact 
only a number of jobs comparable to the number lost in 1993 will 
be created this year. He has said activities in other 
production sectors will increase in the coming months and will 
speed up until the GNP reaches 3 percent near the end of the 
year. He has said the industrial sector is not seeking 
refinancing, similar to that in the agricultural and livestock 
sector, for its overdue loans and that the private sector and 
the Association of Mexican Banks are talking to outline specific 
financing plans for every productive sector. (Mexico City LA 
JORNADA in Spanish 1 Mar 94 p 43) 
  According to the Mexican Stock Exchange, the Mexican 
Government's internal debt increased by 40.3 billion pesos from 
January to the first half of February 1994, a 31.5-percent 
increase over the balance at the end of 1993. Most of the debt 
increase during the period was incurred by the placement of 
Treasury Bonds, through which the federal government obtained 
approximately 26.2 billion pesos; this amount is equivalent to 
65 percent of the internal debt increase during the period. 
Circulating bonds representing the government's internal debt 
amounted to 168.1 billion pesos up to 16 February, one of the 
largest figures since September 1991. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in 
Spanish 2 Mar 94 pp 60, 48) 
  As a result of the economic recession, 75 percent of the 
states experienced a negative employment rate at the end of 
1993. According to the finance group Bancomer, the number of 
individuals registered at the Mexican Social Security Institute 
(IMSS) was considerable, and 70,000 new jobs were opened. 
Bancomer reports in the east, where agricultural and livestock 
activities are predominant, 13,206 unemployed individuals were 
reported; in addition, IMSS has reported 29,000 jobs were lost 
due to the henequen crisis. Also, 641 new jobs were created in 
Chiapas, 2,730 in Oaxaca, 4,334 in Quintana Roo, and 2,333 in 
Campeche. Furthermore, 1,783 jobs were lost in Tabasco, 21,461 
in Yucatan, and Tlaxcala, Veracruz, Hildalgo, and Puebla lost 
8,273 jobs. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 2 Mar 94 p 16) 
  The National Banking Commission, Banamex, has reported as a 
result of a reshuffling of accounts in the banking system, low 
interest rates offered by banks, and the consistent loss of 
salaries' purchasing power, the number of savings accounts 
dropped by 61.45 percent in just 24 months. Conversely, the 
number of time deposit accounts increased from 2,462,000 to 
2,542,000, and the number of checking accounts increased from 
3,510,000 to 4,453,000. Banamex experienced the greatest loss in 
accounts. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 3 Mar 94 p 7) 
  Banamex's preliminary figures for 1993 show a deficit of 
$2.2 billion in the basic chemistry sector. This figure, one of 
the highest sector deficits in modern history, represents 20.7 
percent of the total deficit. A large portion of last year's 
imports were products that require neither high technology nor 
large capital for the construction of new plants. For instance, 
the importation of fertilizers increased by 113.84 percent, to 
$151.3 million; essential oils to $35 million; chlorine to $2.5 
million; tanning extracts to $14 million; medicines to $185.2 
million; and dyes and varnishes to $178.9 million. (Mexico City 
EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 3 Mar 94 p 8A) 
  According to Mexico City's National Chamber of Commerce 
(Canaco), sales by more than half of Mexico City's businesses 
dropped by approximately 39.1 percent last year, due mainly to 
the economic slowdown. Only 13.4 percent of businesses saw 
their sales increase by 13.1 percent. Interviewed businessmen 
have said the economic slowdown was the largest problem, 
particularly during the second half of the year. Some of the 
businessmen have interpreted the occurrence to the economic 
crisis, lack of liquidity, loss of purchasing power, and 
recession. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 3 Mar 94 p 24) 
  Mexican Petroleum, Pemex, has reported the corporation ended 
1993 with a positive commercial balance of $100.3 million. 
Pemex has reported the sale of petrochemical products in 1993 
was $17 million higher than in 1992 as the result of exporting 
3,627 tonnes of greater value-added goods. During the same 
period, Pemex marketed in various countries 1,232,800 tonnes 
worth of goods, which brought $202.6 million into the treasury; 
conversely, Pemex imported petrochemical products worth $18.4 
million less than in the same period of 1992. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 0312 GMT 4 Mar 94) 
  A free trade agreement between Mexico and Costa Rica will 
become effective on 1 January 1995. The legislative branches of 
the two countries must first ratify the treaty, which is already 
agreed upon in San Jose. Presidents Salinas and Rafael Calderon 
Fournier are expected to sign it in April, before Calderon hands 
over office in May. The agreement contemplates tariff benefits 
in three stages (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 
0435 GMT 4 Mar 94) 
  Banco Union and Banca Cremi signed with the National 
Financing Association on 3 March an agreement whereby the banks 
would lower their interest rates on loans to mini- and 
small-scale entrepreneurs by 2 percent. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 4 Mar 94) 
  Ignacio Ramos Gutierrez, director general of the Commerce 
and 
Industrial Development Secretariat's National Commission for 
Foreign Investment, has reported foreign investment reached 
approximately $15.6 billion in 1993 and $2.37 billion in January 
this year alone. A new foreign investment law that complements 
NAFTA was enacted on 27 December to open to foreign investors 
approximately 700 fields formerly reserved for Mexicans. 
(Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0405 GMT 4 Mar 94) 
  Gilberto Jimenez, National Council for Foreign Trade 
president, has reported foreign investments worth $3.5 billion 
arrived in the country during the first two months of the year. 
A sizable portion of the money was invested in agriculture and 
livestock, basic products, food, automotive, and electricity 
industries. Most of the investment was made in the Mexican 
Stock Exchange, however. He has also reported the commercial 
deficit will continue to steepen due to increased exports. The 
deficit is expected to reach $12 billion this year; in addition, 
exports increased by 17.7 percent over last year's figure. 
(Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 4 Mar 94 p 11) 
  The Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development and 
the Bank of Mexico have reported trade with other Latin American 
countries increased by 118.9 percent between 1988 and 1933. 
They have said during that period regional imports grew by 
253.8 percent, while exports rose by 64.6 percent. According to 
the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development and the 
Bank of Mexico, Mexican exports to Latin America totaled $2.9 
billion, which represents 10 percent of total exports. The 
report concludes the largest trading partners of Mexico are 
Brazil, Uruguay, and Colombia. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1700 GMT 
7 Mar 94) 
  The economic slowdown in 1993 had an adverse impact on 
companies that sell their stock at the Mexican Stock Market 
(BMV). At the close of last year, 50 percent of the companies 
operating at the BMV registered losses. On average the 
companies operating at the BMV registered a 2.42-percent growth 
rate. The 215 companies that sell their stock at the BMV 
increased their assets from 37.4 billion pesos to 41.3 billion 
pesos, a 10-percent increase. Meanwhile, the sector most 
affected by the economic slowdown in 1993 was electronics, which 
fell by 238.44 percent. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 7 Mar 
94 p 19) 
  Financial experts have told EL FINANCIERO in the next few 
months the peso will stabilize and revalue against the dollar. 
After ruling out the risk of a devaluation, the experts have 
admitted following a reduction in interest rates the slide rate 
of the peso has increased. Meanwhile, sources at Moodys Brokers 
have warned as long as yields remain low and the Stock Market is 
not competitive, the demand for dollars will grow in border 
states. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 7 Mar 94 p 10) 
  Mexicans have purchased $150-million worth of used cars in 
U.S. states bordering Mexico, taking advantage of the new decree 
by the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development which 
allows importation of models to 1990. The sale of secondhand 
cars in cities such as Houston, El Paso, Austin, San Antonio, 
Del Rio, Eeagle Pass, Brownsville, and Laredo has increased by 
up to 300 percent. It is estimated Mexicans have purchased over 
50,000 cars, trucks, and station wagons that are being brought 
into the country. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 7 Mar 94 
p 22) 
  A report by the Center of Economic Studies of the Private 
Sector (CEESP) has revealed private investments grew by 2.1 
percent in 1993, the lowest growth rate in the last six years. 
It should be noted private investments grew by 20 percent in 
1992, according to the CEESP. The document has revealed in 1993 
the Mexican economy grew during the first two quarters, while it 
decreased during the last half of the year. The document has 
concluded foreign investments grew by 31 percent last year.

  [Text] According to information supplied to LA PRENSA 
GRAFICA by Agriculture and Livestock Minister Antonio Cabrales, 
El Salvador has officially declined U.S. donations of canned 
foods. These donations were guaranteed under Agreement PL-480, 
which many Salvadoran farmers have criticized, because they 
believe it dispenses with incentives for national production. 
  The minister has said the decline is due to food security. 
"El Salvador had the best corn, bean, and millet [maicillo] 
harvest in the country's history during 1992," Cabrales has 
said, adding the agricultural improvement was due to "the 
government's faith in the social market economy and the 
elimination of price distortions." 
  According to the minister, food production in El Salvador 
had 
dropped 12 percent at the end of the 1980's, and food imports 
had increased 60 percent. "For example, we had a deficit of 
more than 600,000 quintals of beans in 1989, and rice producers 
had threatened they would not plant, because donations had 
affected them very much," Cabrales has said. 
  Within the government's food security program, Cabrales 
spotlighted the importance of eliminating price controls and 
closing down the Institute of Supply Regulation (IRA). 
Likewise, the minister has announced during the four years of 
the administration, the ministry's size had been reduced from 
7,000 employees to 3,500. 
  According to an August 1993 UN Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) report, El Salvador is second in Latin 
America in cereal production per capita. Ecuador holds first 
place.

  [Text] Many have argued that NAFTA can threaten the Central 
American and Caribbean economy, basically for two reasons: 
  First because Mexico will have greater access to the U.S. 
market at the expense of the Caribbean. Therefore, Central 
American and Caribbean exports will be at a disadvantage, 
particularly with regard to textiles and apparel. 
  Second, as a result of NAFTA, greater investment will be 
channeled to Mexico, particularly with regard to the 
establishment of U.S. assembly plants and textile industries. 
These will prefer to set up shop in Mexico, not only because 
labor is cheap, but also because of the proximity of the U.S. 
market and the advantages NAFTA offers to the investors of the 
three signatory nations, Canada, the United States, and Mexico. 
  According to an analysis of NAFTA's impact in Central 
America, drawn up by Kathleen Horkan that in turn was 
distributed by the U.S. Embassy's Information and Cultural 
Service, in the sugar sector, for example, Central America could 
lose its competitiveness in the medium term as it will have to 
compete with Mexico on the U.S. market. Another problem pointed 
out in the analysis is that Central American sugar exports could 
face greater restrictions on the Mexican market due to Mexico's 
promise to protect the levels of sugar exported from the United 
States. 
  The textile and apparel sectors that represent one-fourth of 
the region's exports to the United States will also be adversely 
affected. Horkan points out that NAFTA will reduce the tariffs 
in the textile sector for Mexico; thereby threatening Caribbean 
and Central American competition in exports. "Another problem 
is that Central America could lose the opportunity of foreign 
investment in this sector as Mexico will attract greater 
investment as a result of NAFTA," the analyst states. 
  Likewise, the Inter-American Institute of Cooperation for 
Agriculture [IICA] recently published a study on the effects of 
NAFTA on Central American agricultural exports to the United 
States. The study concludes that in three specific cases -- 
cucumbers, pineapples, and melons-cantaloupes -- there is risk 
in the short term that the Central American exports will be 
replaced by Mexican exports as a result of NAFTA. 
  Nevertheless, the IICA study indicates that 82 percent of 
the 
Central American agricultural exports to the United States in 
1991 correspond to products for which Mexico currently does not 
pay import tariffs to the United States. Therefore, more than 
four-fifths of Central American exports will continue to compete 
under the same conditions with Mexican products, even after 
NAFTA's implementation. 
  The Federation of Private Enterprises of Central America and 
Panama, an organization that represent the business interests in 
the region, supports NAFTA. Nevertheless, it believes that "it 
will produce major detours of investments and trade: investments 
that would have come to the region, now however these will go to 
Mexico..." 
  The regional institution indicates in an analysis that the 
Caribbean Basin nations would lose because Mexico would have the 
opportunity to export the same products free of import tariffs.

<F P=106> [Report by Gandi Montoya; from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Eduardo Colindres, Christian Democratic Party 
magistrate to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE], has denied 
the accusation by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front 
[FMLN], adding the Armed Forces will only provide assistance and 
certain facilities after the 20 March elections are over. 
  [Begin recording] [Montoya] Magistrate Colindres has denied 
the TSE wants to include the Armed Forces in an electoral 
organization on election day as denounced by the FMLN. 
According to Colindres, the Armed Forces will not be assigned 
to transport voting supplies or survey roads, but some of its 
units will provide assistance once the elections are over. 
  [Colindres] We have told the FMLN we were only planning to 
use an Air Force helicopter to ship electoral certificates for 
the vote count. 
  [Montoya] Colindres has said the Army's participation in the 
elections will be at a minimum, and, primarily, it will be 
supervised by other people. 
  [Colindres] The helicopter will carry only the pilot, the 
copilot, a representative of the UN Observers to El Salvador, a 
member of each from the departmental and municipal electoral 
boards, and a TSE representative who will bring the certificates 
to the heliport that will be set up in front of the Presidente 
Hotel. 
  [Montoya] Colindres believes the FMLN has played dirty by 
accepting a situation and later denouncing it as a violation of 
the laws; in this regard, Colindres has said the FMLN's 
dishonest behavior could be only the result of a propagandistic 
campaign. [end recording]

  [Text] Armed Forces Spokeswoman Major Edith Vargas de 
Marroquin said yesterday the Army would be willing to accept 
formation of a peace commission if this decision is made during 
the peace negotiations being held in Mexico. When asked if the 
armed institution would accept a resolution they have openly 
opposed and which has been demanded by several grassroots 
sectors, Vargas de Morroquin said: "The Army's position is one 
of respect for whatever the Peace Commission decides." The 
military officer reiterated the Army does not fear the formation 
of such a commission, but she reiterated the inconveniences of 
establishing such a commission, which have been cited by the 
armed institution. She said, however: "We will respect the 
government's decision." 
<H5>  Commission Exceeded Its Functions in El Salvador </H5>
  Dr. Armando Calderon Sol, Salvadoran Nationalist Republican 
Alliance (ARENA) presidential candidate, who is visiting 
Guatemala, has commented on the Truth Commission's role in the 
neighboring country. The commission has played a very important 
role, but, unfortunately, it has overstepped its functions and, 
for example, did not allow FMLN [Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front] commanders to run for public posts in a 
10-year period. This, he has said, has closed opportunities for 
political participation. When asked if he recommends formation 
of a similar commission in Guatemala, Calderon Sol said: "The 
political situation here is very different to the Salvadoran 
one. I cannot make any suggestions in this respect."

  [Text] Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez stated 
yesterday that the Army is confident of the likelihood of the 
signing of a human rights agreements in Mexico and expressed his 
hope that the recent dynamite attack on a bridge on the Atlantic 
route will not influence the talks. 
  "I expect the government delegation will adopt some 
position, 
which I believe it will relay to the insurgents in Mexico; 
however, I expect it will not contribute to curtailing the 
possibility of an agreement," the defense minister added in 
referring to the issue. 
  He was very careful when he referred to the peace talks, 
indicating that in a 10 January agreement, both sides agreed 
that any statements referring to the talks would be made by UN 
Moderator Jean Arnault. 
  "In any case, it should be up to the president or 
[Presidential Adviser] Hector Rosada, but I would be making a 
mistake in commenting on the issue. Even if I were aware of 
what's going on, I would still be missing sufficient details to 
explain the thing clearly and sincerely. Also, we would not 
like to create confusion and distrust with respect to the 
talks," he added. 
  Nevertheless, Enriquez did refer to statements by Commander 
Pablo Monsanto of the Rebel Armed Forces [FAR], who remarked on 
the possibility of an agreement during the talks. Enriquez also 
alluded to the OAS Human Rights Commission resolution on 
Guatemala and stated that not appointing a rapporteur is "a real 
acknowledgement by the international community of the efforts 
the government is making to ensure respect of fundamental 
rights." 
  The defense minister acknowledged that in this respect there 
are still problems, but that efforts have been made and now it 
is impossible to say that there is a policy or systematic intent 
to violate fundamental human rights, and that is why the Geneva 
resolution was something to be happy about. 
  He also commented on recent statements by adviser Monica 
Pinto and stated that "the Army influences political stability 
because that has always been our intention, and there is 
evidence of that." 
<H5>  No Conditions for State of Exception </H5>
  In referring to a possible state of exception in Guatemala, 
the general indicated that so far conditions are not suitable 
for such a measure although if it is ordered, the Armed Forces 
will obey what corresponds, in accordance with the determined 
degree. 
  He indicated that "it is a decision that corresponds to the 
president and the Legislative Branch, we can only receive orders 
according to the degree that is decided. If the decision is 
made, well, there are degrees of prevention, calamity, war, and 
siege." 
  On the other hand, he explained that the boats seen from the 
Presidential Palace are some of the four boats assigned to the 
Pacific and Atlantic naval bases. He, however, denied the boats 
were armed. He did not explain the cost of the boats, but did 
say that they were 27-foot, "Vigilant"-type speed boats to be 
used in counternarcotics, rescue, and other Navy operations. 
The defense minister concluded by stating that the "Navy is 
poorly equipped because it has not received support for the past 
20 years. Some equipment was purchased during the [Jorge] 
Serrano administration, but Ramiro de Leon Carpio has so far not 
even purchased a canoe." 
  [Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish on 8 March carries 
on 
page 3 a 240-word report in which Defense Minister Mario Rene 
Enriquez "did not rule out the possibility that the urban rebel 
commando groups may be the authors of the attack that completely 
destroyed the foundations of the [San Juan River] bridge, 
located 20 km from Guatemala City. He added this is a worrisome 
situation."]

  [Text] Mexico City, 8 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- UN Representative 
Jean Arnault said here that the Guatemalan Government and 
guerrillas today ended a new round of talks without reaching 
definite agreements, but after achieving significant headway. 
In a news conference the UN representative announced that the 
next round of talks is slated for 23-27 March in Mexico City. 
  He explained that the two topics discussed in this round 
were 
the approval of the negotiations calendar on pending topics from 
the general agenda and the topic of human rights. Arnault also 
remarked that it was not possible to complete the topics in 
these negotiations in view that by consensus all sides agreed 
that a new round of talks was necessary. 
  The government representatives and the Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity (URNG) leadership had planned to complete 
talks by Monday -- talks which seek an end to the war that has 
afflicted Guatemala for more than 30 years.

Hernandez Marroquin] 
  [Text] Yesterday, Pablo Monsanto, commander of the 
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG), said that 
retired Generals Jose Luis Quilo Ayuso, Francisco Ortega 
Menaldo, and Roberto Perussina might be responsible for Sunday's 
dynamite attack on the San Juan River bridge, located at 
kilometer 20 on the Atlantic coast highway. 
  Monsanto denied that the URNG was responsible for the 
explosion, adding that the URNG has no men in the area and 
therefore could not participate in that terrorist attack. The 
rebel commander said that, in an attack of this type, one cannot 
rule out the participation of criminal groups who seek to stop 
the peace dialogue, and they might be linked to the retired 
military men who do not want to see an end to the 33 years of 
warlike conflict in Guatemala. 
  For a long time now, Monsanto added, the previously 
mentioned 
military men have caused divisions in the Army, and therefore, 
one cannot ignore their interest in the suspension of peace 
talks between the URNG and the government. Monsanto referred to 
the case of Quilo Ayuso, who during his farewell ceremony at the 
Polytechnic Institute pointed out there was division among the 
military forces.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 8 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Today, an 
official source reported that union leaders took hostage 
approximately 100 Quetzaltenango public office employees. The 
union leaders are demanding wage increases. The Quetzaltenango 
state employees warned they will only leave the offices when 
they are given the 40-percent wage increase they demanded from 
the government five weeks ago. 
  The National Police reported that approximately 800 
demonstrators held a protest and later seized the governor's 
headquarters and the Quetzaltenango municipality with more than 
100 employees. Public security authorities said police 
surveillance will be increased in the coming hours, and they 
will find a legal way to evacuate the municipality and the state 
governor's office. 
  Union leader Oswaldo Squich declared that public employees 
await the arrival of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's 
representative to negotiate. The demonstrators coordinated 
their actions with the leaders of the National Federation of 
State Workers Unions, who are scheduled to meet with government 
representatives. 
  The government employees union leaders temporarily seized 
the 
National Palace, headquarters of the Guatemalan Government, a 
few days ago, over the same conflict. Monday, more than 30,000 
professors joined the protest movement.

<F P=106> [Report by David Gutierrez Lopez] </F>
  [Text] Acting Foreign Minister Jose Pallais asserted that 
Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon's announcement on 
the possibility of taking Nicaragua to the International Court 
of Justice at The Hague for its immigration controls in its 
sovereign San Juan River area are "exaggerated." 
  Pallais, in statements made on the phone from his house in 
Leon, said: "I do not see the need to resort to The Hague to 
resolve matters which we, as friendly countries, can discuss 
ourselves." The Nicaraguan Government informed Costa Rican 
authorities that it "would implement immigration controls on 
tourism activities carried out on that river" and would charge a 
$5 fee for each person who used the river for tourism. 
"Nicaragua is free to implement the measures it feels necessary 
on its territory, and Costa Rica has to respect our decisions," 
Pallais underscored. 
  The Costa Rican president told the Costa Rican newspaper LA 
REPUBLICA over the weekend that he did not agree with the 
measures implemented by Nicaragua because the Canas-Jerez Treaty 
established free transit on the San Juan without any type of 
preference. Calderon requested his foreign minister, Bernd 
Niehaus, to establish immediate negotiations with Nicaraguan 
authorities. "If an agreement is not reached, the future Costa 
Rican administration -- headed by Jose Figueres -- will have to 
present the case at the International Court of Justice, although 
we expect that will not be necessary," he said. 
  Pallais reaffirmed Nicaragua's right to safeguard its 
sovereignty over the San Juan River as established in the 
Canas-Jerez Treaty signed last century. He said the treaty 
stipulates that Costa Ricans cannot navigate more than three 
miles of the river, much less navigate up to Nicaragua Lake, 
which is where Costa Ricans go in a clear violation of our 
sovereignty.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the 3-80 Northern Front in Caulatu, </F>
Quiulali, Nueva Segovia Department on 6 March; from the "Five 
O'Clock Sharp" newscast] 
  [Text] After the Nicaraguan Resistance [RN] General Command 
and the 3-80 Northern Front staff met in Caulatu, Quilali 
Municipality, Nueva Segovia Department, to assess the situation 
of the RN demobilization and to accomplish complete RN unity, 
the following was considered: 
  1. The 3-80 Northern Front is on its way to demobilization 
and being reincorporated into the country's social and civic 
life. 
  2. All RN leaders should be concerned about the desperate 
plight of the RN demobilized. 
  3. At this very moment, our people are conducting a civic 
protest through a hunger strike at the following radio stations: 
Radio Corporacion, El Pensamiento, and Radio Catolica. The 
government, however, has given no indications of desiring to 
resolve this situation. 
  Therefore, we have decided the following: 
  1. We unconditionally support the fair demands of our 
brothers on a hunger strike. 
  2. We strongly condemn the government's failure to give 
any serious indications of willingness to talk with the 
strikers' negotiating commission, a failure that could worsen 
the situation or lead to the death of one of the strikers for 
lack of food. 
  3. The 3-80 Northern Front has been incorporated into the 
RN Higher Council, thus proclaiming tight RN unity. 
  [Issued] Caulatu, Quiulali, Nueva Segovia Department, at 
1730 
on 6 March 1994. 
  [Signed] Jose Angel Talavera, alias Commander Chacal, chief 
of the 3-80 Northern Front staff; Alejandro Alcantara Sosa, 
alias Commander Musul, Staff G-2; Jose Carvajal Espinales, alias 
Commander Martin, chief of operations; Fremio Altamirano, alias 
Commander Jimmy Leo, RN national president; Enrique Quinones,

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Nicaraguan economic developments monitored through 8 
March. 
  Nicaragua will receive donations from the Danish Government 
for approximately $100 million during the period 1994-1998, 
Foreign Cooperation Minister Erwin Kruger announced after 
signing a cooperation agreement with the Danish deputy 
cooperation minister. (Managua Radio Nicaragua Network in 
Spanish 1200 GMT 3 Mar 94) 
  The International Fund for Agricultural Development decided 
on 4 March to grant Nicaragua a loan for $11.4 million to 
finance a project to help small-scale producers in Segovia's dry 
tropical region and in the northeast of the country. Nicaragua 
will have 50 years to pay back the loan at an annual interest 
rate of 1 percent. In addition, the country will have a 10-year

<F P=106> [Report by Daniel Santoro] </F>
  [Text] Reliable Foreign Ministry sources told CLARIN 
yesterday that, during May, Argentina and Great Britain will 
resume negotiations on the possibility of some form of 
cooperation for oil exploration and exploitation in the Malvinas 
Island coastal waters. The Kelpers are scheduled to begin the 
process at the end of the year, with or without Argentina's 
approval. 
  The date for reopening the negotiations (which have been 
frozen since 1992) was agreed between Foreign Minister Guido Di 
Tella and his British counterpart Douglas Hurd during a meeting 
in London on 3 March. Negotiations will be carried out within 
the so-called Argentine-British High-Level Group which has been 
inactive since negotiations failed in 1992. 
  Di Tella was scheduled to make a private visit to London 
this 
coming weekend, but he brought the date forward to 10 March 
despite the fact that President Carlos Menem was still in Spain. 
His haste to meet with Hurd was reportedly due to the fact that 
the meeting was going to take place before this month, but he 
still did not have British approval, which was only granted on 3 
March. 
  Di Tella and Hurd also agreed to negotiate through 
diplomatic 
channels during the time remaining before the meeting -- which 
must be carried out in Buenos Aires -- in order to formulate a 
basis for a prior agreement to guarantee some positive results 
at the key meeting. 
  One of the hurdles -- beside the conflict over sovereignty 
that is being kept under the framework of the so-called 
protective "umbrella" -- is to define the reaches of the term 
cooperation. 
  -- So far, although it is not a definitive answer, Great 
Britain understands that the term only supposes the exchange of 
information and the willingness to act jointly to protect the 
environment. 
  -- Argentina, however, thinks that the term supposes 
participation in oil exploration and exploitation within the 
area controlled by the British. 
  During the London meeting Di Tella mentioned a topic that is 
indirectly related to the Malvinas Islands. He mentioned to 
Hurd "Argentina's concern" over Great Britain's increasing 
political and military relations with Chile. 
  The Argentine foreign minister mentioned the one-week visit 
future Chilean Defense Minister Perez Yoma is scheduled to make 
to London and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 
visit to Chile, among other things. 
  Hurd's answer was that Perez Yoma was invited before he was 
named minister and that Thatcher is no longer a member of the 
British Government. 
  Hurd affirmed that London does not want to drive any wedge 
between Argentina and Chile; on the contrary, it is interested 
in good relations between the two Latin American countries. 
  The Chilean question was only a side issue of the meeting's 
central topic: Oil. Di Tella knows that the issue will be 
essential for the success or failure of his Malvinas policy. 
  The Kelpers are ready to call for bids on the licenses to 
begin exploring and exploiting for oil by the end of the year, 
if negotiations in May fail. 
  This is why leading Foreign Ministry officials are thinking 
of discussing the issue with U.S. Vice President Al Gore when he 
visits Buenos Aires at the end of the month, as CLARIN announced 
on 2 March. 
  What diplomats seem not to have been taken into account is 
that Gore supports ecologist concepts which oppose all 
"off-shore" drilling, due to their negative effects on the 
environment. In any case, to play the North American game now 
seems premature, unless you believe that the May negotiation 
will not succeed due to the distance separating the two parties.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella was not the only 
Argentine official to leave the presidential delegation in Spain 
to travel to London: Employing the subtlety required by his 
position, SIDE [State Intelligence Secretariat] Chief Hugo 
Anzorreguy also boarded a plane for London Heathrow Airport. 
  Once in London, Anzorreguy contacted the British 
intelligence 
chiefs. The gesture would have been nothing more than a 
protocol issue had this not been the first such contact since 
the South Atlantic War in 1982. 
  The gradual thawing of Argentine-British relations, which 
was 
crowned by the resumption of diplomatic relations between the 
two countries almost four years ago, had not occurred between 
the two countries' intelligence organizations. 
  Military and police officers, however, did make contact 
(when 
charges of alleged executions after the Longdon Hill battle were 
being investigated), while Argentine and British officers and 
NCOs who participate in the UN peace forces did fraternize.

  [Editorial Report] Buenos Aires CLARIN in Spanish on 7 
March publishes, on pages 18 and 19, a 1,200-word article about 
the "enthusiastic reaction" by the Argentine Economy Ministry to 
the Brazilian economic program and to the meeting between 
Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Foreign 
Minister Celso Amorim with Argentine counterparts Guido Di Tella 
and Domingo Cavallo in Buenos Aires on 9 March. 
  The article also comments on how Argentina will profit if 
the 
Brazilian economy becomes stable and the Brazilian level of 
consumption increases. It also comments on the political 
meaning of the success of the economic program. The article 
states that Minister Cardoso will become a potential 
presidential candidate for the October elections and run against 
leftist leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. 
  The article quotes the positive reactions of several current 
and former Argentine officials to the plan, stating that they 
believe "the effects of this stabilization will become visible 
in six months." It concludes by stating that conservative 
Brazilians are seeking an "anti-Lula candidate" and that if his 
plan proves successful, Fernando Henrique Cardoso will be an 
"excellent" presidential candidate.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 Mar (NA) -- Personnel of the 
Argentine Federal Police Interpol Department today arrested a 
notorious international drug trafficker who was on the Spanish 
drug enforcement authorities' most wanted list. 
  The criminal is 28-year-old Tomas Moran who, after escaping 
from Spain, clandestinely entered Argentine territory in 
December 1993 to seek sanctuary in our country. 
  After a thorough investigation, Interpol Buenos Aires 
located 
Moran at a rehabilitation center for drug addicts in Buenos 
Aires Province. 
  Moran carried out his unlawful activities in the fashionable 
resorts of Ibiza and Formentera on the Spanish Mediterranean 
coast. 
  Moran is being held in custody at Interpol quarters awaiting 
a decision by the Argentine courts about his extradition to 
Spain.

  [Text] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has also 
commented on the clashes that occurred in Chapare. During a 
news conference, the president commented on the drug trafficking 
issue. He said Bolivia and his administration are coexisting 
with a time bomb because Law 1008 obliges the government to 
eradicate 1 hectare of coca for every cocaine maceration pit 
that is found. He said this is the cause of the problems. 
  [Begin Sanchez de Lozada recording] This causes the problem: 
We have been finding large production centers of cocaine base, 
which is purchased by the main cocaine producers who transform 
this base into cocaine. This concerns us. [end recording] 
  Asked if his administration will defend coca production, he 
said: 
  [Begin Sanchez de Lozada recording] Of course we will defend 
it. Coca is part of our society. It is a consumer product, but 
we cannot protect coca production in the Chapare region where it 
is grown exclusively for drug production, for cocaine 
production. You know very well that if you offer Chapare coca 
leaves to miners, they will refuse to chew them. Miners and 
peasants only chew coca grown in Yungas. This, however, is no 
reason to simply eradicate this coca and fill our country with 
violence. We must find solutions to this problem and these 
solutions can only be found through dialogue. Pressure from 
abroad is great and domestic damage is also great. We cannot 
forget that Bolivia is already beginning to have (?addicts) and 
drug consumption problems. Cocaine base is a very bad drug.

  [Text] Peasant leader Evo Morales of the Chapare coca 
growing region has made an appeal to the Cochabamba prefect 
because of the peasants' uncertainty and desperation in face of 
the government plans to reduce coca plantations by force. 
  He said: "I have great admiration for the prefect. I believe 
he enjoys great sympathy not only among the coca growers but 
also among the people of Cochabamba, and his own party. This is 
why I would like to ask him to implore to his son (director of 
the Agricultural Reconversion Directorate) to prevent the 
suffering of coca growers by ordering the suspension of the 
mandatory coca reduction." 
  Less than three weeks ago the son of the prefect, whose name 
is also German Lema like his father, took over the Agricultural 
Reconversion Directorate which has the responsibility of 
implementing the coca eradication policy throughout the country. 
  Morales said he made the appeal with the understanding that 
the first political authority of Cochabamba, due to his great 
humanitarian feelings, could intercede and "even order the 
suspension of the coca eradication plan because this would be an 
instruction not only from a father but from the prefect." 
  The coca growers believe the government pretext for reducing 
coca plantations is exaggerated and responds to pressure from 
U.S. organizations interested in eliminating coca. 
  He said: "The government knows that the Chapare region is a 
zone highly influenced by drug trafficking. The government knows 
this well, therefore the justifications for reducing coca are 
not solid and awaken greater susceptibility on the credibility 
of the government operations." [sentence as published] 
  The peasants of the Chapare region are afraid and they do 
not 
want to leave their land to preserve their coca plantations 
which, according to several governments, represent the basis of 
the national economy. 
  Morales, who is going to Lima to attend an international 
meeting of peasants, said he will meet with Nobel Peace Prize 
winner Rigoberta Menchu to report the government plans, and to 
ask her to send a letter to the president asking him to stop the 
coca reduction project.

<F P=106> [Report by Manuel Alvarez Cedeno] </F>
  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero has reported 
that the Panamanian Government is cooperating with the DEA in 
the investigation of crimes related to drug trafficking. 
  The DEA dismantled a drug trafficking ring that laundered 
more than $10 million and was made up of Panamanian and 
Colombian lawyers, accountants, and businessmen. Cordero said 
that there is cooperation with DEA authorities to investigate 
drug related crimes. The diplomat said that he agrees with 
acting Attorney General Bolivar Davalos on the rules for this 
cooperation and added that the Foreign Relations Ministry will 
collaborate in this regard. 
  Cordero said that DEA participation in investigations 
related 
to drug trafficking do not violate the country's sovereignty as 
long as Panama grants authorization as a sovereign country, 
which it is. 
  The investigations indicate that distributors in this 
network 
introduced large amounts of cocaine into the United States from 
Colombia and Panama. The deputy foreign minister pointed out 
that DEA agents no longer participate in searches or arrests in 
Panama, leaving these tasks to Panamanian authorities.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Pritsiolas] </F>
  [Text] Opposition spokesmen said yesterday alleged Middle 
Eastern terrorists are in Panama to execute attacks during the 
weeks before the 8 May general elections. 
  Mario Rognoni, PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] 
legislator, said his party has reports "radical" elements have 
been making contacts with those foreigners so they will execute 
violent actions. 
  According to Rognoni, that group of Middle Eastern 
individuals reportedly operates from a residence in San 
Francisco corregimiento. 
  The opposition legislator said PRD presidential candidate 
Ernesto Perez Balladares has been informed of the situation, but 
he does not plan to decrease his campaign visits. 
  Mario Rognoni said the intelligence team that works with 
Perez Balladares gathered the reports about the presence of 
Middle Eastern extremists in Panama. 
  According to Rognoni, all the parties that have nominated 
presidential candidates have on their teams people who in one 
way or another undertake intelligence tasks. 
  Meanwhile, Camilo Brenes, Christian Democratic Party 
legislator, reiterated yesterday Bocas del Toro Province is one 
of the points used for arms trafficking. 
  Brenes said the Changuinola area on the border with Costa 
Rica was used in the past to bring in trailer trucks loaded with 
weapons from Central American countries. 
  Camilo Brenes said he does not have information on the 
hiring 
of Middle Eastern extremists, but he said anything is possible. 
  Months prior to the U.S. invasion of Panama several officers 
of the then Defense Forces traveled to Middle Eastern countries 
to seek military support to confront the North Americans. 
  They were looking for surface-to-air missiles. One of those 
in charge of that mission was Captain Asuncion Gaitan, then 
chief of General Manuel Antonio Noriega's bodyguards. It is 
unknown whether he was able to obtain these weapons. 
  A short time ago, Roberto Troncoso, head of the Panamanian 
Human Rights Committee (CPDH), warned about the possibility of 
death squads operating in Panama. 
  On that occasion, the authorities denied they had reports on 
this and urged the CPDH to provide any information in this 
regard.

  [Text] Today's most recent CID-Gallup poll places Ernesto 
Perez Balladares, PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] 
presidential candidate, at the head of voters' preferences. He 
is followed by Ruben Dario Carles and Mireya Moscoso de Gruber. 
  Perez Balladares continues to lead electoral preferences, 
according to the latest poll by the international consulting 
firm CID-Gallup in an exclusive for RPC Radio and Television. 
This is the most recent nationwide CID-Gallup poll conducted 
between 26 February and 3 March. A total of 1,218 Panamanians 
over 18 years of age were polled. 
  Ruben Dario Carles follows Ernesto Perez Balladares, and 
progovernment candidate Mireya Moscoso de Gruber is in third 
place. Ruben Blades ranks fourth, Christian Democrat Eduardo 
Vallarino fifth, and Samuel Lewis Galindo and Jose Salvador 
Munoz are sixth. 
  Of the total number of people polled by CID-Gallup, 33 
percent favored Ernesto Perez Balladares, 20.4 percent favored 
Ruben Dario Carles, 12.5 percent favored Mireya Moscoso de 
Gruber, 10.4 percent favored Ruben Blades, 3.1 percent favored 
Eduardo Vallarino, and 1 percent favored Samuel Lewis Galindo; 
in the meantime, 19.3 percent are undecided. 
  The poll also revealed seven out of 10 Panamanians responded 
they will probably vote in the 8 May elections, according to the 
CID-Gallup poll. 
  Ernesto Perez Balladares and Ruben Dario Carles also 
monopolize the negative votes, inasmuch as the people polled 
claim these are the two candidates for which the majority would 
not vote for [sentence as heard]. As this chart shows, Perez 
Balladares has 27 percent while Ruben Dario Carles has 26 
percent. 
  The same CID-Gallup poll discloses 60 days from the 
elections 
the PRD is the party with the most followers. Twenty-nine 
percent support the Ruben Dario Carles coalition; Molirena 
[Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement], Morena [National 
Renewal Movement], and Civic Renewal Party receive the support 
of 16.1 percent, while the Arnulfista Party receives 11.8 
percent. Within the next few days, we will report on other 
important results of the most recent CID-Gallup poll in the 
country.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 8 Mar (DPA) -- Colombian police 
have prevented a group of communist guerrillas from detonating a 
bomb at the Justice Palace in the southern city of Florencia. 
Had the bomb exploded, it would have caused significant damage. 
Police spokesmen indicated that the attack was aborted as a 
result of capturing six subversives who were preparing a 20-kg 
bomb a short distance from the building where the Florencia 
justice courts operate. Florencia is the capital of Caqueta 
Department. 
  The guerrillas, apparently Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia members, were captured after the police defused a car 
bomb at the airport in the southwestern city of Cali last night. 
According to General Jose Reyes, commander of Cali's 
metropolitan police, the car bomb, manufactured with 14 kg of 
dynamite, was parked near the "Alfonso Bonilla Aragaon" airport 
by urban guerrilla cells. 
  Beginning a month ago, subversive groups increased their 
terrorist actions to impede next Sunday's parliamentary 
elections, specifically by kidnapping mayors and congressional 
candidates, ambushing soldiers and police, and attacking towns.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 8 
March. 
  EL TIEMPO has conducted a poll in Santa Fe de Bogota and 
Cali, determining "the cost of Colombians' basic basket 
increased approximately 3 percent during the first 20 days of 
February. This leads us to believe the increase will reach 3.5 
percent by the end of the month and that the accumulated 
increase for the first two months of the year could reach 6.7 
percent. This is a high and alarming rate, because the 
government expects to lull the cost of living increase at 19 
percent by the end of the year." The newspaper survey has also 
determined "meat, rice, coffee, lentils, and several fruits are 
mostly responsible for February's inflation." (Santa Fe de 
Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 28 Feb 94 pp 1a, 1b) 
  The National Administrative Department of Statistics (Dane) 
has reported the country's inflation rate amounted to 3.63 
percent in February, "the highest February rate in the last 10 
years." It has also reported "increased school tuitions and 
supplies and strong increases in the prices of certain produce 
prompted this month's increase in the cost of living." (Santa Fe 
de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 2 Mar 94 pp 1a, 1c, 3c)

  [Text] Two-thirds of the people in Quito and Guayaquil are 
in favor of the referendum convoked by the government on 
constitutional reforms. The Guayaquil daily EL UNIVERSO reports 
that out of 600 persons polled 63 percent said they agree with 
holding a referendum, while 37 percent said they are opposed to 
it. EL UNIVERSO adds that 66 percent do not know what the 
questions of the referendum are, while 34 percent do know what 
they are. 
  Other questions asked were whether congress should be a 
single chamber as it has been up to now or whether there should 
be two chambers. Another question was on the issue of double 
nationality for emigrants who have acquired another citizenship. 
  Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen announced that on 1 
May there will be a referendum on eight questions that refer to 
elections, duration of deputies' terms, reelection for 
presidential and other public offices, and parliamentary control 
over state funds. 
  The referendum has been criticized by the majority of 
Ecuadoran political sectors, who say that it is unconstitutional 
and irrelevant. However, the poll discloses that the majority 
of people support the referendum. 
  The same poll states that 33 percent of people feel that the 
questions are very important; 34 percent say they are quite 
important; 27 percent describe the questions as not very 
important; while only 6 percent believe they are not important 
at all.

  [Text] Huancayo, Peru, 7 Mar (EFE) -- It was reported here 
today that last week an Army patrol killed a terrorist and the 
police seized a large volume of weapons, ammunition, and 
explosives in various areas in Junin Department. 
  The political-military command issued a communique, which 
was 
disseminated today in Huancayo, Junin's capital, saying that on 
4 March an Army patrol, alerted by local inhabitants, captured a 
terrorist group in Ipoki, between the jungle settlements of 
Satipo and Chanchamayo. 
  The communique says that an undetermined number of 
subversives escaped, although one of them was wounded by the 
military. The wounded subversive died while on his way to a 
hospital. 
  The terrorist had in his possession two grenades and Tupac 
Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) propaganda. This group has 
been practically disbanded by security forces. 
  On 3 and 4 March police raided three residences in the area 
surrounding Huancayo, 315 km east of Lima, and seized a large 
number of weapons, explosives, two grenade boxes, diverse 
caliber ammunition, and military clothing. 
  The residences allegedly served as arsenals and hideouts for 
Shining Path activists. The police source did not give details 
but added that several people were detained. 
  According to private and public statistics disseminated 
today, terrorist activities are gradually decreasing in the 
country. The relative Shining Path and MRTA presence has been 
reduced to only three areas in the country in recent years. 
  Both subversive organizations have been hard hit by security 
forces since 1992 and 95 percent of their leaders have been 
captured and sentenced to life in prison, including Shining 
Path's highest- ranking leader, Abimael Guzman, and MRTA top 
leader Victor Polay.

  [Text] The main leaders of the national labor unions have 
deemed historic the decisions adopted yesterday by the national 
workers' congress that was organized by the CUT [United Workers 
Trade Union Federation, the CNT [National Workers Federation], 
and the CPT [Paraguayan Confederation of Workers]. It was held 
at the National Sports Council stadium. Some 300 grassroots 
delegates participated in the congress. One of the most 
important conclusions reached was to stage a general strike on 2 
May. 
  A national struggle committee was established, headed by the 
top leaders of the labor unions. The committee will be in 
charge of coordinating the strike. The leaders said the current 
economic policy, as well as the government officials' "lack of 
social sensitivity" are behind the call for a general strike. 
The last such strike in our country was staged 36 years ago, in 
1958. 
  The leaders who attended the congress also decided to 
condition to three issues the presence of the labor unions in 
the tripartite round of negotiations on the macro-social policy, 
which they have been holding with the government and 
entrepreneurs. The first condition calls for the immediate 
release of the leaders of the transportation sector labor 
unions, who were arrested on 6 March in Quiindy. The second 
calls for release of the peasant leaders who are being kept at 
the former Security Guard facilities. The third calls for the 
automatic dismissal of all members of the Administrative Council 
of the Social Welfare Institute and the end to repressive 
measures against any demonstrations by workers or peasants. 
  The workers congress also decided to participate actively, 
with all its grassroots, in the peasants' march scheduled for 15 
March. The march will start with a gathering at the former 
Metropolitan Seminary and parade along Eusebio Ayala Avenue to 
Uruguay Square. From there, the demonstrators will try to reach 
the National Congress building. 
  The transportation sector labor unions and some teachers' 
organizations will also participate in the march. The teachers 
will stage a 24-hour stoppage on that same day. 
  It was also decided during the congress to support the 
general strike to be staged by the urban buses drivers, which 
has been scheduled for 21 March. The USTT [Transportation 
Sector Workers Trade Union] and the Fetrat [Transportation 
Sector Workers Federation] have reported that if Roberto Medina 
and Samuel Arguello, the leaders who were arrested in Quiindy, 
are not released by tomorrow the transportation sector strike 
will be moved forward to 15 March. 
  The national workers' congress decided to ask the government 
to readjust by 40 percent the current minimum wage. It is 
expected the government will show signs of willing to meet this 
demand before 2 May. If this occurs, the official attitude will 
be considered a sign of "goodwill."

  [Text] Brazil and Venezuela have reactivated their 
cooperation activities, thus overcoming a period of tensions 
that characterized the coexistence of these two countries for 
almost 150 years. At the conclusion of the visit paid by 
Brazilian President Itamar Franco to his Venezuelan counterpart 
Rafael Caldera, the importance of the meeting was underlined by 
the level of the Brazilian ministers who also came to La Guaira, 
that is, the heads of five important ministries in the foreign 
affairs field: the industry and commerce, mines and energy, 
foreign affairs, environment, and justice ministers. 
  The two presidents issued a joint communique creating a 
high-level binational commission that will be in charge of 
stepping up cooperation in the border areas. The commission 
will be headed by the foreign ministers, and will include all 
the sectors of the Brazilian and Venezuelan economy. 
  To mark the meeting the presidents signed a protocol which 
is 
to be added to the 1977 friendship and cooperation agreement 
between the two countries. Caldera stated emphatically: "What 
happened in the Amazon jungle a few months ago (the murder of 
Ianomami Indians) helped us open our eyes, and made us aware of 
the need to harmonize our policies and join efforts to attend to 
this vast Amazon region, which has great natural resources." 
  The visit was also commented on by Alberto Poletto, 
president 
of the Venezuelan Foreign Trade Institute. In his opinion, the 
meeting contributed to increased bilateral commercial relations. 
  Trade between Venezuela and Brazil amounts to approximately 
$800 million, with a $200 million balance in Brazil's favor. 
  A partial agreement negotiated in 1991, by which Brazil 
granted Venezuela preferential taxes for 600 new items, is 
currently in force. Venezuela has granted Brazil preferential 
taxes for 300 new products. Venezuela purchases 37 percent of 
what it purchases from ALADI [Latin American Integration 
Association] member countries in Brazil. 
  During the meeting the presidents raised several 
international issues, such as: 
  -- President Itamar Franco said that Mercosur [Common 
Market of the South] can coexist with NAFTA or with the Andean 
Pact. 
  -- Regarding the candidates for OAS secretary general, 
Franco commented that "Brazil received a request, which we are 
assessing, that this post be occupied by the president of a 
certain Republic. We have discussed the issue with the Colombian 
Foreign Ministry." 
  Brazil has already announced its support for Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria. The Venezuelan president said that 
Venezuela supports its Foreign Minister Burelli Rivas. 
  -- Regarding Argentina's purchase of fighter bombers from 
the United States, Franco asserted that Brazil does not 
interfere in other countries' policies, and that its policy is 
one that seeks peace. Caldera noted that Venezuela's stance is 
similar to Brazil's. He does not believe there is an ongoing 
arms race in Latin America, nor that the United States wants to 
promote one.

  [Text] The "war" waged by rival drug traffickers of 
Mangueira shantytown, which has already resulted in 14 deaths, 
reveals that the CV (Red Command) and the TC (Third Command) are 
becoming weaker and more divided. This change began in the late 
1980's following the arrest of the main leaders. 
  This version on the situation of trafficking in the Rio de 
Janeiro shantytowns -- with incidents during the past years -- 
is upheld by a "friend" of CV leaders who chose to remain 
anonymous. He said that the "media" has created an image of 
power that these groups never enjoyed. He added: "Moreover, 
most drug traffickers have always been independent." 
  Another person who does not believe in the power of the CV 
and TC as organizations is Prosecutor Raphael Cesario, 55, who 
believes that this oversizing -- nourished by some policemen -- 
is designed to protect the true cocaine and weapons traffickers: 
The numbers game operators. Cesario says people "are stupid" if 
they believe the great traffickers "live in shantytowns 
surrounded by cockroaches and open sewers."

  [Text] San Jose, 8 Mar (DPA) -- Costa Rican President-elect 
Jose Maria Figueres today called on citizens of that country to 
tear down "the walls of intolerance and misunderstanding," after 
announcing the cabinet that will guide his administration, which 
he will assume on 8 May. 
  Figueres announced five areas of action, namely economy and 
commerce, health and social welfare, transportation and 
infrastructure, foreign policy, and institutional and moral 
renovation, coordinated by the vice presidents or advisers and 
collaborators of the future president. The future president 
insisted his cabinet will work under the concept of teamwork. 
Figueres stressed his administration will struggle to improve 
the standards of living of the middle class, affected by a 
phenomenon of impoverishment, as well as "the sectors that have 
less." 
  Regarding economic and commercial matters, the 
president-elect announced he will work to modernize the country, 
increase production efficiency, and "intelligently" join the 
large commercial blocs that are being formed currently 
throughout the world. 
  The government team announced by Figueres is characterized 
by 
a combination of young professionals and others of great 
experience in public administration. 
  The president-elect selected in the 6 February elections 
insists he will fight neoliberal policies promoted by the 
current Social Christian administration of President Rafael 
Angel Calderon. He added he will seek negotiations and 
"solutions Costa Rican style" with the international financial 
organizations. 
  Within this context, Figueres placed the coordination of the 
economic area in the hands of Carlos Manuel Castillo, current 
president of the National Liberation Party (PLN), the party that 
brought him to power. Castillo will also be the executive 
president of the Central Bank. 
  With this action, the president-elect intends to "tie" the 
decisions of the economic cabinet to the principles that in this 
area the PLN defends, which are of a social democratic 
orientation. 
  Economist Fernando Naranjo will be the new foreign minister. 
According to Figueres, Naranjo will have to study how to 
reorganize Costa Rican foreign policy to bring it in line with 
the new foreign policy ground rules and principles. 
  Figueres created a new ministry, rural development, which 
will be occupied by Roberto Solorzano. The president-elect 
explained that the creation of this ministry responds to a 
"commitment" with the agriculture sector. 
  Meanwhile, Figueres designated economist Luis Diego 
Escalante 
as the Costa Rican representative for international 
negotiations. An attorney, Juan Diego Castro, will be the new 
minister of public security and another attorney, Maureen Clark, 
will head the Ministry of Government and Police. 
  The government team that will be installed on 8 May is the 
following: 
Foreign Relations: Fernando Naranjo 
  Public Security: Juan Diego Castro 
  Government: Maureen Clark 
  Culture: Arnoldo Mora 
  Planning: Leonardo Garnier 
  Health: Herman Weinstock 
  Education: Eduardo Doryan 
  Housing: Edgar Arroyo 
  Rural Development: Roberto Solorzano 
  Finance: Fernando Herrero 
  Economy: Marcos Vargas 
  Agriculture: Mario Carvajal 
  Foreign Trade: Jose Rossi 
  Natural Resources: Rene Castro 
  Science and Technology: Roberto Robles 
  Transportation: Bernardo Arce 
  Presidency: Elias Soley 
  Information: Flory Rodriguez 
  Justice: Enrique Castillo 
  Labor: Farid Ayales 
  Tourism: Carlos Roesch 
  Minister Without Portfolio: [blank] 
  Special Projects: Longino Soto 
  Regional Coordination: Sergio Quiros 
  Figueres made this announcement at the National Museum in 
San 
Jose, the same place where his father Jose Figueres Ferrer, 
three-time president and the last great political leader of 
Costa Rica, abolished the Army 45 years ago after winning an 
armed confrontation defending clean elections. 
  The president-elect burst into tears when he held in his 
right hand the old mallet his late father used in 1949 to tear 
down a wall symbolizing the elimination of the Armed Forces. At 
that very moment, Figueres called for understanding, effort, and 
sacrifice to confront "the difficult challenges" facing his 
administration.

  [Text] The Human Rights Committee is investigating the 
alleged torture of people arrested on drug trafficking charges. 
Here is Mario Espinosa's report: 
  [Begin recording] [Espinosa] Drug trafficking continues to 
be 
of paramount importance here in Bolivia, and particularly in 
Congress. Five people who were arrested in Chonchocorro have 
visited the Human Rights Committee office. They are testifying 
in the case of the DEA safe houses, and what they call the 
constant human rights violations by DEA agents. This is why 
policemen can now be seen at Congress. 
  The Human Rights Committee has several reasons for beginning 
this investigation: One originated in the United States, where a 
communique reports that human rights violations are being 
committed under the guise of the antinarcotics struggle. 
  Outside the committee's office, people were saying the 
arrested people were giving detailed reports of the torture 
sessions they endured at the DEA safe houses. 
  This was confirmed by Juan del Granado, president of the 
Chamber of Deputies Human Rights Committee: 
  [Granado] We will continue the investigations to prove or 
disprove charges that have been made public and which we 
received today. These are the starting point for the 
investigation. We are concerned about this situation because we 
have repeatedly received charges that Special Antinarcotics 
Force, FELCN, agents are torturing Bolivian citizens under the 
guise of judicial police investigations. If this is the case, 
the legislative branch will adopt drastic measures. 
  [Espinosa] Juan del Granado clearly said it: We cannot 
accept 
that one crime should used to fight other crimes. If the 
charges are proven there will be sanctions. [end recording]

  [Text] The prosecutor general's [Gustavo de Grieff] 
questionable situation moved into even deeper water this 
afternoon. When he was about to meet with Cali Cartel lawyers, 
he received a surprise visit by the DEA director in Colombia. 
  Attorney Bernardo Gonzalez, representative of Gilberto 
Rodriguez Orejuela, and Attorney Juan Fernandez Carrasquilla, 
representative of Julio Fabio Ordinola Grajales, arrived this 
afternoon at the prosecutor general's office to confirm that 
their intentions to surrender remain firm. Although the slated 
meeting did not take place because de Grieff left hastily to 
meet with President Cesar Gaviria, the visit of the DEA director 
in Colombia caused surprise. Authorized prosecutor general's 
office spokesmen said it was regrettable that the U.S. 
Government, through the DEA, meddles in the surrender process. 
According to the attorneys, the Colombian Government has not 
allowed the surrender. 
  [Begin recording] [Fernandez] In our opinion, the delay is 
the government's fault. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Why? 
  [Fernandez] Because the government has not decided yet to 
guarantee the jail. Before any more steps are taken in the 
negotiations, the Justice Ministry must guarantee the prosecutor 
general's office that the inmates will not be moved from the 
place where they surrender. [end recording] 
  To conclude, the attorneys said that their clients' 
surrender 
will be done individually and not in the name of the drug cartel.

  [Text] Quito, 7 Mar (EFE) -- On behalf of the Armed Forces, 
Ecuadoran Defense Minister General Jose Gallardo said today that 
"smoke does not mean there is a fire," referring to rumors that 
a coup d'etat is being prepared against the government of 
President Sixto Duran-Ballen. 
  "In this case, the smoke does not mean there is a fire. Not 
at all. There is no justification for a coup d'etat in Ecuador 
because the country needs to live in democracy to be able to 
build its future," declared the general at a local television 
station. 
  Gallardo added: "The Armed Forces are quite conscious of the 
respect they owe to the people's will; they are loyal and aware 
that such an action would prompt international isolation and 
internal problems. Thus, I believe we should never again talk 
about coups d'etat in Ecuador." 
  Recently, Duran-Ballen on several occasions has had to deny 
such a possibility, as well as deny his resignation in favor of 
Vice President Alberto Dahik. 
  The defense minister referred to U.S. Ambassador Peter 
Romero's recent statements recommending that Ecuador forget its 
territorial demands from neighboring Peru. The Peruvian and 
Ecuadoran Armed Forces have clashed twice in the past 50 years. 
"All I can say is that Ecuadoran sovereignty issues, especially 
those that are so painful to Ecuadoreans, such as territorial 
problems, only concern Ecuadoreans. The Ecuadoran Armed Forces 
are capable of guaranteeing the defense of the country; they 
have a vocation for peace, but also our people's great dignity," 
he declared.

  [Text] An emergency law presented to Congress by Treasury 
Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez was approved this evening after 
Congress debated it for three hours in a bicameral session. The 
only thing that remains now is for the legislative branch to 
send the document to the executive for confirmation. 
  In a bicameral session, Congress approved a law dealing with 
the nation's financial crisis. MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] 
Deputy Walter Marquez, who has closely followed the Banco Latino 
case, as president of the commission investigating the case, 
gave his opinion on this law: 
  [Begin Marquez recording] The most important points approved 
guarantee bank deposit insurance from 1 to 4 million bolivares 
and the appointment of representatives for the depositors to the 
Intervention Board. Meanwhile, the Intervention Board is 
authorized to pay senior citizens over 60 and people who are in 
a difficult economic situation enough to cover their daily 
expenses. Likewise, the mechanisms to handle financial 
emergencies were established, and in the same manner, mechanisms 
were set up to obtain temporary financial aid. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Berenice Gomez Velasquez] </F>
  [Text] Following the executive branch's announcement that 
the national budget will be reduced 10 percent, the Armed Forces 
has reduced its budget for this fiscal year by at least 6 
billion bolivares. Very well-informed military sources made this 
announcement because no official information is available at the 
ministry. 
  The estimated budget reductions are as follows: Army: 17 
percent, which is equivalent to approximately 3 billion 
bolivares; Navy: 11 percent, which is equivalent to about 700 
million bolivares; Venezuelan Air Force: 7 percent, which is 
equivalent to 400 million bolivares; and Armed Forces of 
National Cooperation: 16 percent, which is equivalent to about 
2.4 billion bolivares. 
  Reports indicate that Rear Admiral Panayotis Francis Sanchez 
was the officer tasked with making the estimated reductions, but 
it was not explained why, in certain cases, the reductions were 
higher than the recommended 10 percent. There is hope the 
figures will be reduced somewhat due to the ongoing war against 
narcoguerrillas, Colombian brigands, and Brazilian gold 
prospectors on the Brazilian-Colombian border, especially when 
the National Armed Forces is being urged to comply with its 
duties of providing protection and security in areas that are so 
far away that they are nearly inaccessible and where millions 
are spent in fuel flying and navigating for hours. 
  This reduction will affect the four components of the 
military forces. It will supposedly affect their operation as 
little as possible and funds for gasoline, food, supplies, and 
preventive and operational maintenance programs will be left 
untouched. Reports indicate there are no plans for acquisitions 
this year. There is no indication whether allocations to buy 
artwork, pay bonuses and representational expenses, remodel 
offices, maintain and remodel the "El Cielo" ministerial 
residence and the main residences and summer residences of the 
general commanders, and pay the salaries of household personnel 
at these residences will be reduced or eliminated. 
  There is also no indication whether there will be reductions 
in allocations for military health, especially when military 
hospitals throughout the country are facing problems of scarcity 
and private medical care is so expensive. No explanation was 
given on whether the reduction will affect the execution of the 
main maintenance contract for missile frigates hulls, which was 
approved and signed by the Navy, Congefan [National Armed Forces 
Comptroller General's Office], and the national Attorney 
General's Office. 
  It is possible the National Guard [GN] will be the most 
affected because the "secret funds," which are mostly used to 
cover salaries and to partly pay for intelligence work, were 
reduced. Therefore, some GN training schools will be closed to 
avoid expenses because there will not be enough funds to pay for 
new salaries. It is hoped the GN budget reduction will be 
reconsidered and reduced to at least one fourth of what was 
proposed so as not to affect the GN training.

  [Text] Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez Frias, leader of the 
failed 4 February 1992 military coup, in a letter he sent to 
this newspaper yesterday, explained he is willing to resign from 
the National Armed Forces [FAN] 24 hours after being released. 
  The commander, who is staying at the Military Hospital, said 
the situation following statements by the president have 
prompted his decision. In a speech the president of the 
Republic has said the only obstacle that can keep an officer or 
noncommissioned officer from returning to active duty in the FAN 
is his political involvement. 
  He has admitted that of the many officers and NCOs of the 4 
February uprising still in prison, "only Hugo Chavez Frias has 
assumed a permanent and critical political attitude, in his 
attempt to respond to the expectations of the people who woke up 
and stood on their feet that night, while all the other officers 
and NCOs have remained almost completely silent." 
  He accepts responsibility for the position publicly adopted 
by the 200 Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement and accepts 
whatever punishment that may result from such statements. 
  Following the reasons given by the commander in chief, I 
hereby state to my countrymen I will physically leave the Army 
and hang up my uniform 24 hours after my release, if this should 
occur." [no opening quotation mark as published] 
<H5>  The Conditions </H5>
  Commander Chavez states in his document that to request his 
resignation the following specific conditions must be met: 
  1. Freedom and a return to active duty of ALL [previous word 
published in uppercase] officers, NCOs, and subordinate soldiers 
still imprisoned for the 4 February and 27 November events, 
provided this is their wish. 
  2. Restitution of retirement pension rights and all other 
social and economic benefits to ALL [previous word published in 
uppercase] officers and NCOs discharged after 10 or more years 
of active duty. 
  3. Solutions to the problems described by senior officers 
still imprisoned who cannot or do not want to remain on active 
duty. 
  4. Discussion and approval of a swift solution plan for 
the Venezuelan soldiers who are abroad, in Peru and Ecuador, 
considering the fact most of them would like to return to active 
duty and that none of them has adopted any specific political 
position.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 8 
March. 
  A study by Fogade (Deposit Guarantee Fund) indicates that it 
provides an average of 11 to 12 billion bolivares every day to 
the Construccion, Maracaibo, Latino, La Guaira, Metropolitano, 
and Sociedad Financiera Fiveca banking institutions. Already, 
Fogade has provided these banks sums in excess of 300 billion 
bolivares. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 2 Mar 94 p E-11) 
  The Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) was able to sell all its 
zero-coupon bonds, worth 25 billion (no currency specified), 
thereby, revealing the liquidity level of the market. The fact 
that all the bonds were sold shows that the country is beginning 
to solve the national financial crisis. Only the seven banks 
that have asked for financial assistance continue to have 
liquidity problems. (Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 3 Mar 94 p 16) 
  In February, BCV international reserves dropped to $11.249 
billion and the consumer price index went up 1.9 percent, 
official news agency VENPRES reported. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 
1610 GMT 3 Mar 94) 
  Swedish Ambassador in Venezuela Peter Landelius has stated 
that bilateral trade between his country and Venezuela totals 
over $200 million a year. (Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 4 Mar 94 
p 7) 
  Venezuelan petroleum expenses increased 56.669 billion 
bolivares as a result of the currency being devaluated. The 
foreign exchange rate, which was 69.29 bolivares per dollar in 
1992, increased to 92 bolivares per dollar in 1993. In its 
annual report, the Energy and Mines Ministry reported that oil 
export revenues in 1993 totaled 1,027,947,000,000 bolivares, 
which represents an increase of 257.36 billion bolivares over 
1992, which totaled 770.911 billion bolivares. The report also 
states that the total amount of oil exports in 1993 reached 2.14 
million barrels per day, of which 69.59 percent represents crude 
oil and 30.41 percent, oil by-products. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA 
ECONOMIA in Spanish 4 Mar 94) 
  Carlos Garcia, executive director of the 
Colombian-Venezuelan 
Integration Chamber, has reported that trade exchanges between 
the two countries reached $1.6 billion in 1993. This increase of 
about 62 percent over 1992 favored Venezuela's trade balance by 
$197 million. The trade balance favored Colombia in 1992 by $126 
million. Private Venezuelan investments in Colombia totaled $27 
million and private Colombian investments in Venezuela totaled 
$6 million. (Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 7 Mar 94 p 24)

  [Text] President Aristide has officially rejected the 
legislators' plan voted last week in the Chamber of Deputies. 
The president-in-exile considers this plan not in compliance 
with the Governors' Island accord signed in New York last July 
and even counterproductive to implementation of this accord for 
the reestablishment of democracy in Haiti. President Aristide 
made these statements on 5 March during a meeting with UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
talked for more than an hour with Mr. Butrus-Ghali while several 
thousand Haitians demonstrated near UN headquarters in support 
of the president-in-exile. 
  In a news conference following talks with the UN secretary 
general, the president-in-exile accused the United States of 
playing a double game. According to Father Aristide, while 
Washington publicly reasserts its willingness to support the 
return of democracy to Haiti, it has simultaneously submitted a 
draft resolution to the UN Security Council which, he says, is 
the other side of the coin. For the president-in-exile, there is 
no possible solution outside the framework of the Governors 
Island accord. 
  We refuse to participate in the delay tactics and political 
cynicism of the international community, which is ambiguous and 
weak, says the president-in-exile, and which lacks the 
willingness to implement the process decided on Governors 
Island. He acknowledges, however, a firmer commitment from 
France and Canada. In an effort to afford a quick, direct 
solution to the crisis, President Aristide again asked for the 
application of a strict and total embargo. He said that 
international military intervention is unnecessary. He demanded 
above all the departure of the authors of the coup d'etat before 
considering the nomination of a new prime minister and the 
installation of a concord government. 
  According to a high-ranking UN employee who attended the 
talks between President Aristide and UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, the president-in-exile appeared at the same time 
intransigent and disappointed. This high-ranking employee 
indicated that Jean-Bertrand Aristide feels betrayed by the 
international community on Governors Island. 
  In a press release issued after the meeting, the UN 
secretary 
general stated that the crisis settlement plan voted by the 
Haitian legislators constitutes a means of overcoming the 
deadlock and achieving implementation of the Governors Island 
accord, not the substitution of this accord. 
  Butrus-Ghali and Jean-Bertrand Aristide promised to continue 
to explore the means of solving the crisis. It should be 
recalled that on the eve of this meeting between the UN 
secretary general and the president-in-exile, the group of the 
Four Friends of Haiti submitted to the UN Security Council a new 
draft resolution for reinforcing the international sanctions 
against Haiti. The draft resolution provides for a total trade 
embargo except for food and drugs, the cancellation of 
noncommercial flights to and from Haiti, as well as travel 
restrictions on the coupists and their relatives abroad. The 
Security Council is due to make a decision within 15 days of 
this resolution.

  [Excerpts] There was confusion at the Haitian parliament on 
8 March. Employees were forced to leave the Legislative Palace 
by a group of armed men who did not hesitate to beat them to 
compel them to leave the premises. The following is a report by 
Jean Luckenson. 
  [Begin Luckenson recording, in Creole] There was much 
tension 
at the office of the Senate of the Republic on Tuesday, 8 
February [date as heard]. Both high level employees as well as 
lower-level ones were obliged to clear out, to run away because 
of threats by 18 January Senator Osny Eugene, the quaestor of 
the unofficial Senate office who was very angry and took off his 
jacket so he could drive employees out. He was accompanied by 
policemen and armed civilians who were jostling employees and 
who even used their weapons to hit the employees. An employee, 
who told us what was going on, said that the employees have 
nothing to do with the running battle within the Senate of the 
Republic. So, they will not budge an inch, they will wait for 
Senate President Firmin Jean-Louis. We must tell you that even 
the secretary general of the Senate shared the fate of the 
employees. [passage omitted] 
  Sen. Osny Eugene, quaestor of the unofficial office, 
asserted that he had sent a press release to the radio stations 
asking employees to stay home. This is why he drove employees 
out on the morning of 8 March. The controversial 18 January 
senator went on to say there must be a meeting of the 26 
senators so they can reach a compromise. [passage omitted] 
  For his part, Sen. Bernard Sansaricq described what happened 
at the Senate office on 8 March -- when Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis, 
legitimate president of the Senate of the Republic, came back to 
his office -- as an impertinence. The president of the 
unofficial office stated that the situation (?is back to 
normal), that he will sit normally, that he has a mild 
temperament, but that he can become extremely violent, and that 
this is what explained his silence on 8 March. [passage omitted] 
  Until 1500 this afternoon, we noted the presence of the 
senators of the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion, the 
controversial 18 January senators, but no National Front for 
Change and Democracy Parliamentary Bloc senators were present. 
So, sessions could not be held by the legitimate office led by 
Firmin Jean-Louis. We must tell you that many arrests were made 
by armed civilians who injured a young man with a gun before 
taking him away. Members of the press who were on the scene 
received threats from armed civilians who prevented them from 
coming near the scene to see the disturbances and mayhem.

  [Excerpts] The official Senate quaestor has reacted. 
Senator Julio Larosiliere has charged Sen. Osny Eugene and Sen. 
Bernard Sansaricq with the responsibility for the physical 
attacks on employees of the Senate administrative service. 
[passage omitted] 
  Firmin Jean-Louis, the official senate president, says he 
has 
advised the senators not to go to the premises of the Senate in 
order to avoid any clashes. Jean-Louis has called the incidents 
barbarous acts. Sen. Jean-Louis says he asked the police chief 
to intervene to stop the acts of banditry, but that he remains 
unsatisfied. 
  [Begin Jean-Louis recording, in Creole] [passage omitted] 
The 
first thing we did was to communicate directly with 
Port-au-Prince Police Chief [Lieutenant] Colonel [Joseph Michel] 
Francois. I had a long telephone conversation with him. I 
explained to him the situation the way it had been explained to 
me. As Senate president, I formally asked him to take the 
necessary measures to ensure not only the safety of the building 
[corrects himself] of the buildings, but also the safety of the 
senators. He told us that -- just as he agreed to send 
policemen on 7 March at the request of Sen. Sansaricq -- he 
agreed to send soldiers to the Senate. The soldiers may ensure 
safety both inside and outside of the building, but they will 
not intervene in what may happen between senators. This 
supposedly means that the soldiers can do nothing in the event 
that senators aim weapons at one another. [passage omitted] [end

  [Text] The Senate office led by Firmin Jean-Louis asks 
Senate employees not to show up for work in the aftermath of 
incidents that took place on 8 March in the Senate, while they 
await clarification of the situation. In a statement read on 
Radio Metropole, the Senate quaestor made reference to 
brutalities committed against employees. He also denounced the 
behavior of legislators who used force to control the Senate.

the threats by members of the so-called office, threats on 
radio, and the arbitrary arrest of the assistant chief of the 
Senate supply service under the instigation of those same 
citizens, one did not imagine that they would move from words to 
action. In fact, some Senate employees were ill-treated, some 
beaten by this same group and other armed individuals working 
for them. 
  Since the office has no means of dealing with this situation 
except those provided by the Constitution and the Senate's 
internal rules, the office is obliged to take the following 
extraordinary and limited measures: 
  1. While waiting for the office to take all necessary 
measures to guarantee the security of all senators and staff, 
the quaestor's office asks employees not to show up for work on 
Avenue Marie-Jeanne in the Biscentenaire area. 
  2. The office asks the staff to keep in touch with the 
quaestor's office in order to receive their paychecks and all 
other important communications. 
  Thank you. 8 March 1994, Julio Larossiliere, senator of the 
Republic, quaestor in the Senate. [end recording]

  [Text] In Port-au-Prince, the Carrefour-Feuilles Platform 
[Plateforme de Carrefour-Feuilles] organization criticized the 
attitude of some FNCD [National Front for Change and Democracy] 
legislators who gave their support to the plan approved by the 
legislators. The Carrefour-Feuilles Platform condemns the 
decision of the CONACOM [National Congress of Democratic 
Movements] secretary general who supported the legislators' 
plan. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] This plan is one way 
for the State Department, Victor Benoit, the Army, and the 
macoutes to extinguish all the hopes that the 16 December and 20 
January elections brought the Haitian people. We are 
criticizing all the FNCD legislators who let Victor Benoit and 
the State Department buy them in order to sell out the country 
so that repression and beatings replace democracy in the 
country. We call those legislators Lavalas traitors with no 
conviction. The Carrefour-Feuilles Platform is astonished to 
see that lust for power made Victor Benoit forget all the 
CONACOM militants who were killed during the coup d'etat. 
  Who is to say that they were were not accomplices in the 
killing of those militants! The State Department should either 
officially support the criminals or the return of Aristide and 
democracy to the country. Our words are our convictions in the 
Carrefour-Feuilles Platform. [end recording].

  [Text] The UN Security Council has given itself some time 
for reflection before adopting a draft resolution reinforcing 
the sanctions against Haiti in order to examine in detail the 
technical and political aspects of such a decision, indicated 
French Council President Jean-Bernard Merimee. It is a complex 
draft resolution and the Council needs some time to examine it, 
Mr. Merimee told the press after a Security Council consultative 
meeting attended by Dante Caputo. 
  It should be recalled that on 4 March, the group of four 
[France, Canada, Venezuela, and the United States] submitted to 
the Security Council, a resolution providing notably for the 
imposition of a trade embargo against Haiti and some sanctions 
against the military. 
  Those measures, which would be added to the oil and military 
embargo in effect since last year, would constitute a new 
attempt from the international community to force the Haitian 
military to give back power to President Aristide and to 
facilitate his return to Haiti. However, the resolution 
requires the effective cooperation of Mr. Aristide in the search 
for a political solution before the imposition of new sanctions 
against Haiti.

  [Text] Aruba can remain part of the Kingdom of the 
Netherlands after 1 January 1996. But the Lower Chamber does 
want the island to take a number of measures in order to greatly 
improve the standard of government. 
  Minister Hirsch Ballin (Netherlands Antilles and Aruban 
affairs) was pleased yesterday evening by Parliament's response. 
"The protracted mock battle on possible independence is no 
solution to the problems which Aruba is currently facing." 
  CDA [Christian Democrat Appeal] deputy Bijleveld-Schouten 
yesterday summarized the position: "Sound and honest government 
in Aruba is of the utmost importance. Also with regard to the 
situation in the Netherlands Antilles." 
  The date for independence of 1 January 1996 was laid down in 
the Kingdom statutes when Aruba broke away from the Netherlands 
Antilles in 1986 and achieved separate status. Aruba does not 
now want independence as the island fears that it will cause 
foreign investors to pull out. Next week the Upper House must 
decide whether Aruba will be allowed to remain within the 
Kingdom.

  [Text] Havana, 9 Mar (DPA) -- "The United States failed 
today in its attempt to drag Latin American and Third World 
countries into voting in favor of an anti-Cuban resolution at 
the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva," a foreign ministry 
source in Havana stated in commenting on the voting results. 
  The resolution proposed by the United States and cosponsored 
by Nicaragua and El Salvador was approved by 24 votes in favor, 
nine against and 20 abstentions. 
  Juana Silveira, deputy director of the International 
Organizations Directorate of the Foreign Relations Ministry, 
stated that "the vote on the U.S. proposal reflects an ever 
increasing perception by underdeveloped nations with respect to 
this issue" 
  Silveira believes the issue has been highly politicized by 
Washington, and the U.S. Government's political intention is to 
include it within the framework of the dispute it has had going 
with Cuba for years. 
  According to official Cuban sources, the number of countries 
that "resisted pressure and refused to vote in favor of the 
resolution" increased this year in comparison to 1993. 
  "In failing to obtain half plus one favorable votes of the 
nations gathered at the commission, and seeing its efforts to 
obtain massive support from Latin America thwarted, the White 
House saw its main hopes begin to vanish," Silveira pointed out. 
  Likewise, she stated that this year, contrary to 1993, the 
proposal found less support among Asian, European, and Latin 
American nations. It was not supported by African countries 
either. 
  Local radio stations reported that in addition to the United 
States, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Costa Rica, Chile, 
Cyprus, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, 
Japan, Mauritius, Holland, Pakistan, Poland, South Korea, 
Romania, Great Britain, Russia, and Uruguay all voted in favor 
of the resolution. 
  China, Guinea-Bissau, Libia, Sudan, Syria, India, Indonesia, 
and Iran supported Cuba. 
  On the other hand, the nations that abstained included 
Angola, Bangladesh, Barbados, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Ivory 
Coast, Gabon, Kenya, Lesotho, Malaysia, Malawi, Mauritania, 
Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Sri Lanka, Togo, Tunisia, and Venezuela.

  [Text] Today in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, Cuban 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina stressed that Indonesia has 
done commendable work as president of the Nonaligned Movement 
[NAM]. In Indonesia Robaina began a tour through several South 
and Southeast Asian countries with the objective of 
strengthening Cuba's bilateral relations with those countries. 
  During his visit to Indonesia, Robaina is to meet with 
President Soharto, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, and other 
ministers and businessmen as well. Robaina told the press that 
Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam are at present experiencing 
high rates of economic growth, and that for that reason, Havana 
is interested in expanding its trade ties with Jakarta. 
  This is the second time Robaina has visited the Asian 
continent. Shortly after he became foreign minister he made a 
visit to China, where he met with Qian Qichen -- who is vice 
premier, State Council -- and with Vice President Rong Yiren.

<F P=106> [Telephone conversation between reporters Roberto Cavada in </F>
Havana and Rey Rodriguez in Jakarta -- live] 
  [Text] [Cavada] This is a live link-up with Jakarta, 
capital of Indonesia, connecting with reporter Rey Rodriguez who 
is accompanying Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina on his 
tour of several Asian countries. Greetings from Havana, Rey. 
  [Rodriguez] Greetings, Cavada. Well, the most important 
thing 
I can tell you now is that within a few hours, Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina will be received by Indonesian 
President Suharto at Government Palace here in Jakarta, capital 
of Indonesia, the fourth most heavily populated country in the 
world, with 189 million [as heard] inhabitants. 
  I said that the meeting will be held within the next few 
hours because it is now a little past 0100 in the morning. I 
wish to remind you that there are approximately 12 hours' 
difference. This Robaina-Suharto meeting has dual importance: 
First, because the foreign minister will be received by the head 
of the government of a country that is currently achieving a 
very high economic growth rate; and second, because it has 
strong commercial relations with highly developed nations such 
as Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong, among others. 
  But I can tell you more: Indonesia has great regional 
influence not only in the economic area, but in the political 
field as well. Indonesia has served as mediator in several 
regional conflicts, as in the case of Cambodia, and today it is 
a member of the nonaligned movement. 
  In a meeting with the local press, Robaina said that today 
all members of the movement are satisfied with the work carried 
out by this nation, and with its efforts to strengthen 
South-South relations. In this regard, Indonesian Foreign 
Minister Ali Alatas today said: 
  [Begin Alatas recording, in English, with simultaneous 
translation into Spanish] We have talked about some of the 
problems we are facing, and as members of the nonaligned 
movement, and as individual countries, we both agree, as we have 
always agreed among members of the movement, that now more than 
ever we need to contribute and to continue playing the same 
role, to keep participating in a world that is rapidly changing, 
a world in transition. [end recording] 
  Today the Cuban delegation will also meet with the top 
Indonesian Congress representative, then leave for Laos, second 
leg of the Cuban foreign minister's tour of Asian countries. 
  [Cavada] Thank you very much, Rey, for this additional 
report 
for the many listeners of Radio Rebelde. This was a direct live 
report by journalist Rey Rodriguez who is accompanying Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina on his tour of several Asian countries.

<F P=106> [Article by Jukka Rislakki: "Food Shortage, but No Famine in </F>
Cuba"] 
  [Text] There is an ongoing debate, both in Cuba and abroad, 
whether Cubans go hungry or not. 
  However, beggars are starting to appear on the streets of 
Havana, and the food shortage is a common subject of discussion. 
According to reporter Jukka Rislakki from HELSINGIN SANOMAT, a 
month's worth of food coupons last for two weeks, and for the 
remainder of the month, the Cubans must scrounge for food 
anywhere they can or buy it on the black market. 
  In the morning, residents of central Havana and hotel guests 
are awakened by the crowing of roosters. The culprits can be 
found on the flat roofs of apartment buildings, where the Cubans 
keep their living, cackling food stores. Pigs and goats can be 
found in the backyard mazes. 
  Every day, teacher Alejandro Valdes works with his 
"livestock" on the roof, from where he has a view of the sea. He 
has a dozen hens, a few chicks, and a few rabbits are huddled in 
a cage. The door leading to the roof from the attic is locked 
with a bicycle chain. 
  "I listen for thieves at night and stay awake with my 
machete," said Alejandro. 
  The teacher brings feed for his animals from his job, as 
well 
as from the park and the port. "When grain ships discharge their 
cargo, I am there collecting corn that has fallen to the ground. 
And I am not alone there," he said. 
<H5>  Food Shortage Topic of Discussion </H5>
  Valdes started keeping animals last May. Now the family and 
its closest relatives get three to four eggs a day--equaling the 
official monthly ration for a Cuban--and often they also get 
meat. "Meat and eggs are rationed in the stores and otherwise 
they are too expensive, and we have no dollars," he added. 
  "The hens are of good native stock. In this neighborhood, 
many people also keep goats and pigs," said Valdes. 
  In Cuba and abroad there is a debate on whether Cubans are 
starving and whether the food shortage is affecting their health. 
  "People starve to death," complained an expatriate woman, 
who 
had been visiting her native country. "It seems to me that they 
eat very little and look very skinny," she continued. 
  "Have you seen any dying people on our streets?" asked 
Governor Jose Hernandez, on his part, and answered: "Of course 
not! We are not a people dying of starvation, but a people 
defending its accomplishments." 
  But beggars are starting to appear on the streets, and the 
food shortage is a common subject of discussion. The shortage of 
vitamins is acknowledged, and last spring the government 
exhorted people to eat the seeds, flowers, and leaves of certain 
plants. 
  "No hay, haven't got it," is the familiar response in a 
Cuban 
store. As the skimpy card ration is not sufficient, even for 
half a month, the remainder of the food must be acquired on the 
black market or -- if one has dollars -- from a hard currency 
store. 
<H5>  The Brave Become Restaurateurs </H5>
  Food can also be acquired through barter, or one can grow it 
oneself. At certain times, using a special permit, city dwellers 
may visit a canteen in the area, if there is one. 
  Last fall, dozens of "dollar restaurants" cropped up in 
cramped apartments and backyards in Havana, after the government 
started to allow strictly regulated private businesses. The 
restaurants have become enormously popular. 
  A licensed entrepreneur may now make his living in about 100 
professions; from shoe polisher and artisan to hairdresser, taxi 
driver, and repairman. The hiring of outside labor is 
prohibited, and taxes must be paid. A Cuban with a university 
degree may not become a private entrepreneur. 
  Consequently, some brave souls started to sell meals. 
Addresses are provided by helpful Havanans, but finding a dark 
restaurant on an ordinary weeknight proved surprisingly 
difficult. 
  Finally we found the neat kitchen of Reinaldo and Sofia at 
the end of a dark alley. There our host and hostess were setting 
the table. 
  Preparing food for surprise guests took an hour, and 
Reinaldo 
poured us some wine made of sugarcane. The meal proved to be 
worth waiting for: delicious ham, rice, and beans for two 
dollars per person. Somewhere else the meal would have cost 
about 10 dollars. 
  Reinaldo, who is a cook by profession, told us that he buys 
supplies in the countryside and only caters to "reliable" 
customers. 
<H5>  Threat of Fines or Imprisonment </H5>
  Restaurateurs are risking the punishment of fines or 
imprisonment. The police are supposedly difficult to deal with; 
others can be taken care of with a small bribe: "If the CDR (The 
Revolutionary Defense Committee) happens to come and inspect the 
place, I'll offer them a free meal." 
  The government has clarified the rules for private 
entrepreneurs and has stipulated that they are not allowed to 
sell perishable foodstuffs, meals, and alcoholic beverages. Only 
kiosks that sell, for example, bread products, beverages in 
containers, and candy are permitted. We were told that, during 
the last term of the parliament, the police effected stronger 
enforcement and raided numerous restaurants. 
<H5>  Cuban One-Month Ration </H5>
  For 35 years Cubans have lived in a controlled economy with 
rationing coupons. Below is a list of items included in a 
person's ration for a month, which can be purchased at 
reasonable cost, in pesos, from a state store. In part, the 
rations are theoretical, as everything is not always available. 
The availability of staples--rice, cooking oil, eggs, and 
chicken--has been poor lately. 
  Six pounds of rice, 8 ounces of white beans, 3 lbs white 
sugar, 3 lbs brown sugar, 1/2 lb cooking oil, 1/2 lb chicken, 
4-5 eggs, 1 lb picadillo, made of soy, blood, and meat, 3/4 lb 
goose liver, and once a day, a piece of bread the size of a 
fist. A coffee package is included once every 15 days. 
  A small bar of soap, a tube of toothpaste per family, a 
matchbox, two bottles of household alcohol. 
  A pound is less than half a kilogram and an ounce is 28 
grams. 
  In reality, it has been a long time since the following 
products have been available: butter, milk, cheese, meat, 
potatoes, black beans, vegetables, fruit, spices, beer, rum, 
chocolate, soap, laundry soap, and toilet paper. Shoes are 
rarely available. 
  Milk is available for children under age seven. Pregnant 
women and sick people are guaranteed special diets.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Inflated Payrolls and the Labor Parliament"] </F>
  [Text] The first 267 sessions held in workplaces to discuss 
the economic and financial problems of both the nation and of 
each workplace reveal the people's growing awareness of the need 
to end the negative phenomenon of inflated payrolls. 
  However, the real consensus on this strategic goal does not 
guarantee that there will be the same agreement on tactics, 
which deal with how to bring about a downsizing process. 
  Many other questions on this issue may have answers that do 
not always agree. For that very reason, they are an important 
topic of debate at the Workers' Parliaments being held in 
workplaces. 
  In these discussions, however, it is wise not to exaggerate 
the impact of an overlarge work force on the inefficiency of 
some workplaces. 
  Payroll is, of course, an element to be considered in 
seeking 
efficiency, but not the only one, and in our present situation 
it is possible that it may not even be the most important factor 
in a great many places. 
  We want to make this clear and apply a remedy before it is 
too late, so as to keep administrative reports from dragging 
this out with excessive analyses of this aspect of a complex 
solution, while rejecting other approaches that might well have 
a greater impact on inefficiency, and which could be introduced 
quickly without having to engage in consultations. 
  As an example, let us take the case of workplaces with 
massive quantities of missing items, items that are not paid for 
and workers that do not pay for their sales and purchases; 
workplaces where workers squander raw materials and fuels 
without respecting or even considering consumption regulations; 
workplaces where workers produce very low quality goods; 
workplaces with workers with high absenteeism rates, etc., etc., 
etc. 
  In summary, we believe it is better to analyze thoroughly 
other possibilities for improving efficiency, before seeking 
immediate solutions by downsizing payrolls. 
  We say this, among other reasons, so as not to forget that 
the sensitive downsizing process cannot tolerate improvisations 
or local measures not in full compliance with our state policy, 
and with the decisive participation of the union movement. 
  "No downsizing process can be carried out without the 
unions. 
This is a requirement, an essential condition for it to be done 
with quality. It is an orderly and managed process," stated 
Carlos Lage, vice president of the Executive Committee of the 
Council of Ministers, speaking at the recent session of the 
National Committee of the CTC [Cuban Workers Federation]. 
  Lage also explained that the guiding principle continues to 
be to transfer surplus personnel to other activities or to 
create new, economically justified functions within the same 
workplace. 
  It is clear that the ministries and their sector and 
business 
institutions can and must study and suggest solutions, but their 
actual application will depend on a general policy approved at 
higher levels with the input of the CTC and its unions. 
  We maintain that the payroll downsizing process should be 
done gradually, avoiding traumatic consequences in any sector, 
area, or activity of labor. 
  We agree that labor restructuring should proceed quickly in 
workplaces whose products are essential for our economic 
revitalization, and which currently have difficulty performing 
their functions. 
  In general, the view that downsizing and its dynamics are 
related to the potential for existing jobs or jobs that may be 
created in the territories or in enterprises and sectors should 
take priority; an active policy of training and retraining must 
be included. 
  It is our view that future decisions on payroll downsizing 
should be based on case-by-case analyses, not on 
one-size-fits-all formulas. 
  In the Workers' Parliament sessions, the most informative 
and 
educational thing may be payroll analyses to determine what 
salaries paid inefficiently mean in terms of the actual cost per 
peso of production. This might serve as a basis for finding 
solutions for the problem. 
  That cost breakdown must be prepared so that the cost per 
factory, per shop, per shift will be shown. 
  If these data for the enterprise are available, but the 
workers do not know them, the current effort to improve 
efficiency loses one of its best weapons. 
  We also wish to speak out against simplistic views that 
consider the mobilization of personnel for agricultual 
activities, microbrigades, or defense work, like building 
people's tunnels, as sources of workplace inefficiency. 
  These personnel, said Lage at the meeting mentioned earlier, 
cannot be considered surplus, for their work is useful to the 
nation. 
  Now that the parliaments are being intensified at 
workplaces, 
it is worthwhile for the problem of surplus personnel to be 
analyzed everywhere without embellishing or concealing anything, 
with the certainty that there is no room for discouragement or 
confusion. 
  The solutions are in the hands of the workers. We must make 
sure that any future decision on employment and relocations will 
reconcile the interests of the nation and social justice.

  [Text] The parliament in the workplace assemblies conclude 
on 16 March after two months of fruitful exchanges of opinion on 
how to attain greater economic efficiency, as well as proposing 
measures aimed at contributing to the streamlining of the 
nation's internal finances. 
  During a meeting of the National Secretariat of the CTC 
[Cuban Workers Federation], CTC Secretary General Pedro Ross 
reported that the CTC is now preparing to evaluate and devote 
attention to what the workers brought up, and to promote the 
(?adoption) of measures, so that every proposal gets its 
response. For that reason, the CTC will meticulously take stock 
of the process in each province. This assessment will begin on 
17 March, with Holguin, and conclude on 25 March, with Villa 
Clara. The matter will also be examined during the expanded 
national CTC committee meeting, scheduled for 29 March. 
  [Havana Radio Rebelde Network at 1000 GMT on 9 March, in 
this 
same connection, reports: "The monitoring of excess workers and 
their utilization based on the principle of seeking a position 
for personnel without a job, takes on greater importance at the 
current moment of struggle for economic efficiency, pointed out 
CTC Secretary General Pedro Ross Leal during the meeting of the 
CTC Secretariat."]

  [Text] On the occasion of Cuban Press Day, which will be 
celebrated nationwide on 14 March, the Jose Marti distinction 
for lifetime work will be awarded for the first time, in special 
recognition of the sector's most outstanding professionals. The 
award will be granted during the national expanded UPEC [Union 
of Cuban Journalists] plenum, which will also be held on 14 
March. The plenum is to examine important matters related to the 
development of the press in Cuba, following the sixth UPEC 
Congress. 
  UPEC president Tubal Paez announced that the commemoration, 
instituted as an historical tribute to the founding of the 
newspaper PATRIA by Jose Marti, is being observed nationwide, 
with homage being paid in discussion and exchange forums. These 
have already begun in Cienfuegos. 
  The UPEC presidency reported that UPEC is working on 
restructuring the provincial emulation competitions in order to 
choose a site for the Press Day events and the PATRIA newspaper 
award. 
  In this capital, Cuba's journalists paid homage to Enrique 
de 
la Osa, Santiago Alvarez, and Adigio Benitez [all names as 
heard] -- living legends in print journalism, cinematography, 
and graphic arts. Certificates were awarded to commemorate the 
moment. The moment, however, was far more memorable to those who 
attended the meeting that followed the initial ceremony, which 
opened to the collection of stories and the broad vision of 
professionals who, through their different ways of doing things, 
have set press standards. 
  At the meeting to pay homage to De la Osa, Alvarez, and 
Benitez, one of the fascinating subjects turned out to be the 
revival of ("Nao") and "Hanoi: Tuesday the Thirteenth" ["Hanoi, 
Martes Trece"], two of the best-remembered plays by the man who 
founded the (ITAI-Latinoamericano) newscast. UPEC's homage to 
three great members of the national press constituted 
reaffirmation of the value of Cuban journalism, its 
perspectives, and its spirit.

  [Text] In a meeting chaired by Candido Palmero Hernandez, 
first secretary of the Cuban Communist Party in Havana, and 
Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan Morales, special control and 
protection measures were adopted in Havana Province for the 1994 
Agro-94 [1994 agricultural harvest] campaign. 
  Approximately 1.5 million quintals of tubers and vegetables 
will be picked this month in Havana Province, including a 
significant quantity of potatoes, while in April some 2 million 
quintals of agricultural products are expected to be harvested. 
  These measures were adopted to prevent these agricultural 
products from reaching other destinations. These measures 
include the control of the fleet of trucks that will participate 
in the Agro-94 campaign, preventing them from taking other than 
assigned routes. These measures will not be limited to the 
outskirts of Havana, but will be extended to all of the 
capital's distribution and collection areas up to (La Placita). 
  During the meeting, Palmero Hernandez said that black market 
proliferation must be stopped. He added that certain elements 
are dedicated to profiting at the expense of the people.

  [Text] The UN Human Rights Commission [UNHRC] has approved 
a resolution against Cuba that is in keeping with the 
traditional U.S. policy of hostility and reflects the constant 
politicization of that UN commission. The document presented by 
the United States was adopted by a vote of 24 in favor and nine 
against, with 20 abstentions. Nicaragua and El Salvador were the 
only Latin American countries to back the resolution. According 
to diplomatic sources, the result of the vote did not satisfy 
the United States which insisted, up to the last minute, that it 
would obtain 40 votes in favor. 
  A project similarly based on selectivity and discrimination 
in the treatment towards Cuba at the UN Human Rights Commission 
was also approved under U.S. pressure last year, by a vote of 27 
in favor -- only three more than this time.

<F P=106> [Article by Jesusa Cervantes] </F>
  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas -- Some 2,000 Indians 
from nine Chiapas municipalities yesterday marched from their 
communities to this city's Mayor's Office, where they staged a 
sitdown strike, and said they will take up arms if their 
problems are not resolved. 
  The participants of this demonstration, which began at 1100, 
entered San Cristobal de las Casas on the two main roads from 
the municipalities of Las Margaritas, Ocosingo, Comitan, 
Palenque, Chanal, Hiuxtan, San Juan Chamula, Altamirano, and 
Zinacantan. 
  Domingo Lopez, the leader of those who were displaced from 
Chamula, stated that: "We do not want this peace if there is no 
justice, freedom, and democracy, and we warn that if the 
government does not listen to us, we will take up arms. If we 
are killed, the government will be responsible." 
  The demonstration was called by State Council of Indian and 
Peasant Organizations [CEOIC], which groups Indian associations 
together. The demands include the immediate dismissal of all 
municipal presidents on the grounds that they were appointed and 
do not answer the demands of the citizens. They also demand the 
dismissal of all members of the local congress. 
  Lopez said: "If the government does not listen to us, what 
we want to avoid will occur -- there will be more bloodshed, we 
are poor Indians and have nothing to lose." Lopez added: "We 
will not allow the deaths of our brothers of the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army [EZLN] to be in vain." 
  The communique was signed by CEOIC members, who explained 
that only Indians who had not been forced to go -- as has been 
done in ceremonies staged by the governor -- attended the 
demonstration. 
  Slowly, Indians from the Chiapas mountains arrived at the 
Municipal Palace, where the EZLN issued the Lacandona Jungle 
declaration on 1 January. For a minute-and-a-half, raising 
their fists, the demonstrators payed homage to fallen EZLN 
members. 
  Representatives of the various organizations stressed their 
unconditional support for the EZLN and its causes.

<F P=106> [Text of a letter sent by inhabitants of San Cristobal de </F>
las Casas to the three branches of the Mexican Federal 
Government and the Chiapas State Government, Peace Commissioner 
Manuel Camacho Solis, and Jorge Madrazo, president of the 
National Human Rights Commission; date not given] 
  [Text] We hereby inform you that on 7 March 1994 
approximately 2,000 inhabitants of the community of San 
Cristobal, duly accredited as representatives of various urban 
and rural area civic groups, met in San Cristobal de Las Casas. 
These groups include the Constitutional Municipal Council; 33 
community aid and participation councils; the National Chamber 
of Commerce; the Rotary Club; the Lions Club; the Junior Chamber 
of Commerce; hotel operator, restaurant owner, and travel agent 
associations; the Peasant Grassroots Committee representing 
20,000 Indian residents of 74 rural communities throughout the 
municipality; professional lawyers, doctors, dentists, and 
builders associations; the Municipal Parent Teacher Association; 
Territorial Movement grassroots social committees; members of 
the National Federation of Organizations and Citizens (FNOC) 
[Federacion Nacional de Organizaciones y Ciudadanos]; the 
Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM); the Revolutionary 
Confederation of Workers and Peasants (CROC); the General 
Confederation of Workers (CTG); homemakers associations, and 
foundations. 
  During the meeting, the current situation in the San 
Cristobal District was examined in full detail, in light of the 
current events following the 1 January armed incursion and, in 
addition, the arrival of groups of peasants from other states 
and from communities within Chiapas. Said groups have violated 
the peace of our town with acts that range from demonstrations 
of disrespect for our dignity and our municipal integrity to 
outright acts of provocation and hostility and the commission of 
crimes against our property. Such crimes include damage to 
private property, looting, illegal occupation of public roads, 
illegal representation, accessory to crimes, illegal 
association, threatening schools, and other unlawful acts. The 
community has reported these acts to the appropriate authorities. 
  The entire population of San Cristobal de las Casas strongly 
condemns these events. Despite this, and to demonstrate our 
compliance with the principals of justice and democracy for the 
Indians -- one of the issues that inspired the movement -- we 
have been respectful toward the events related to the peace 
negotiations. In addition, we have patiently cooperated 
throughout the peace process regardless of the personal 
annoyance and economic harm said process entails. 
  However, we the Coletos, the true community of San Cristobal 
by birth or affinity -- despite the deceitful propaganda 
displayed by many members of the media -- say ENOUGH. 
Therefore, in an appeal to what is our last hope before 
emotions explode beyond control, with faith in our state of law, 
and with the prior approval and verification of the people, we 
hereby publicly DEMAND: 
  1. The immediate eviction of those occupying the 
Municipal Palace, Plaza 31 de Marzo, and Parque de los Arcos. 
  2. Immediate eviction of those who have invaded urban and 
suburban properties. 
  3. That the peace agreements be signed in another town. 
  4. Active participation of the Armed Forces in 
maintaining law and order throughout the community. 
  5. Full effect and application of the law. 
  6. Immediate deportation of those troublemaking 
foreigners who cannot prove their legal status in this 
municipality and in the country. 
  7. Impartial performance of the human rights commissions 
and nongovernmental organizations, in light of their evident 
tendency to favor criminals and offenders of the law. 
  8. Respect for our Municipal Urban Development Plan to 
administrate the use and adjudication of lands, implement 
ecological conservation areas, and ensure an orderly development 
process, without allowing any more irregular human settlements 
to develop. 
  9. Respect for municipal autonomy, thus allowing the true 
members of the San Cristobal community to participate in the 
decision making process that affects our town. We will not 
allow any person, group, or authority from outside our 
municipality to decide whether our municipal authorities, who 
were elected by the sovereign will of the people, should remain 
in place or not. 
  10. We request that Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia be 
transferred to a different dioceses once his job as mediator in 
the peace and reconciliation talks is over. The assembly of the 
San Cristobal community publicly charges him, along with his 
catechists, deacons, and priests -- all of whom preach 
liberation theology -- of being the mastermind of these 
movements. This demand must be sanctioned by the inhabitants of 
the other municipalities within the dioceses. 
  11. Temporarily closing all Catholic churches for public 
worship or any other use. To this end, the Government 
Secretariat and Social Development Secretariat must immediately 
take control of the buildings until the San Cristobal assembly 
decides differently, given that both religious worship and the 
use of the buildings have been distorted, mainly to defend 
crimes. The resident reaffirm that being devout does not 
require the work of priests at this time. 
  12. Strengthening neighborhood organizations to 
consolidate the organization of the people of San Cristobal. 
  13. The objectivity of the international, national, state, 
and municipal media, requesting they investigate and be aware 
who are the real San Cristobal residents because, so far, they 
have only heard the usurpers of our community and have distorted 
the real expression of our people. 
  14. Political organizations must be prohibited from using 
our municipality as a stage for their disputes and our city must 
not continue to be a ring where candidates to the presidency of 
the republic, the Nobel Peace Prize, and the Chiapas 
governorship are negotiated. Special note must be made of the 
public charge presented at the assembly against officials who 
helped create and finance the State Committee of Indian and 
Peasant Organizations, responsible for the seizure of our 
Municipal Palace. 
  15. Our vigorous protest must be presented to the Oaxaca 
Government and Elba Esther Gordillo, national leader of the 
Union of Education Workers, on the participation of Oaxaca 
citizens and union teachers in the seizure of land and the 
occupation of public buildings. 
  16. Peace and Reconciliation Commissioner Manuel Camacho 
Solis must demand the necessary impartiality from Bishop Samuel 
Ruiz Garcia in his position as mediator so that the interests of 
the Mexican community will be expressed freely and without 
pressures. It is obviously hoped that this objectivity will not 
produce revenge or reprisals, in the face of which the people of 
San Cristobal will remaine unified and dignified. 
  It must be clear that the people of San Cristobal are 
confident in the peace negotiation process. We support it and in 
no way will we permit that our just demands be used as a pretext 
or argument to hinder those talks. Moreover, we ask the peace 
and reconciliation commissioner that these no less legitimate 
demands, which also entail peace and justice, be included in the 
dialogues, even though this city is no longer the site of the 
talks. 
  We also express solidarity with the Indian people's demands 
for development and all the support mechanisms that the 
government and civilian society will establish for their 
benefit. Like them, we also demand honesty and sincerity as well 
as efficiency and productivity to lift them from their state of 
under development. We know the beneficiaries will assume their 
responsibilities as active participants in their development, 
with sufficient maturity so as to not need unofficial 
interlocutors. 
  In defense of these demands, the San Cristobal assembly 
unanimously decided to request the presence of the state 
governor as soon as possible so the previous charges can be 
confirmed by the civilian population, and so the San Cristobal 
assembly can become a permanent civic assembly through the 
Citizens Front for the Defense of San Cristobal Dignity, 
legitimately represented by the signatories.

<F P=106> [Live report by Mary Carmen Camacho in Tuxtla Gutierrez, </F>
Chiapas; from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] 
  [Text] Once again, there is a lot of tension in Chiapas. 
There have been many protests by people either in favor or 
against dialogues with the EZ [not further identified], which 
are being held at the San Cristobal de las Casas Cathedral. 
Bishop Samuel Ruiz has received death threats. There is a lot of 
activity in Chiapas State. 
  Let us hear from Mary Carmen Camacho, who is in Tuxtla 
Gutierrez, the Chiapas State capital. Good evening, Mary Carmen. 
  [Camacho] Good evening, Pepe. Here is my report. Today, 
eight masked men killed Mariano Perez Diaz, regional leader of 
the Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization. Francisco Meneses 
Gazon, municipal president of Simojovel, reported that the 
peasant leader was killed this morning on the doorstep of his 
home in El Carmito, 15 km from Simojovel. The son of the [word 
indistinct] leader in northern Chiapas was wounded in the attack. 
  Meanwhile, approximately 70,000 workers, members of the 
Confederation of Mexican Workers [CTM], have threatened to break 
with the national CTM leadership if Fidel Velasquez does not 
accept the Chiapas workers' proposal that a CTM congress be held 
in Chiapas and that the state's CTM executive committee be 
elected here. At a meeting in Tuxtla Gutierrez in which 
representatives from almost 400 Chiapas labor union 
organizations participated, the participants ratified Carlos de 
Jesus Nataran Cordoba as CTM leader in Chiapas and expelled 
Javier Proter Maldonado, who yesterday was assigned to the post 
by CTM national leader Fidel Velasquez without the knowledge of 
the Chiapas workers. 
  Nataran Cordoba, the acknowledged leader, said the Chiapas 
workers had thought about breaking with the CTM and forming 
their own labor federation. CTM workers said they will use force 
to keep the people appointed by Fidel Velasquez to the CTM state 
executive committee from taking office. This is what has 
happened in Chiapas.

<F P=106> ["Text" of Bulletin No. 31 issued by the Mexican National </F>
Defense Secretariat on 8 March in Mexico City; from the "24 
Hours" newscast] 
  [Text] In its preliminary report on the armed conflict in 
Los Altos de Chiapas issued on 22 February, the National Human 
Rights Commission stated that it has received 76 complaints of 
human rights violations allegedly committed by Mexican Army 
members. 
  In this regard, the Judge Advocate General's Office explains 
that of the 76 complaints mentioned by the commission, it has 
only been notified of 46, of which 40 have already been 
investigated within the legal time period with no evidence being 
found that military personnel were responsible. The remainder 
are under investigation by the citizens complaint office. Three 
cases are under preliminary investigation. Two of them allegedly 
occurred in Ocosingo, and one allegedly occurred in Altamirano. 
An in-depth investigation is being carefully carried out. 
  Even though the National Human Rights Commission is the 
constitutionally recognized organization in charge of protecting 
human rights on national territory, we have also heard 
complaints from the national human rights network called All 
Rights for All [Todos los Derechos para Todos], which submitted 
a list of 127 alleged violations by Army members. Up until 
now, 93 of them have been resolved, and the military has no 
responsibility. The 34 remaining complaints are in the 
investigation process and are being cleared up by the citizens 
complaints office. Likewise, we reiterate to the public that 
the complaint office is permanently open to receive any person 
wishing to report any improper conduct by military personnel. 
  As for the armed institution, it is important to clear its 
members beyond any shadow of a doubt, because, as it has been 
reported to the public, any conduct contrary to military 
discipline will be penalized according to what has been 
stipulated in our Code of Military Justice. The goal is to 
irrefutably prove that the charges that have been filed against 
Mexican Army personnel in some cases have only been unfair 
accusations.

  [Text] San Jose, 7 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican President 
Rafael Angel Calderon said today that he will talk to Nicaraguan 
President Violeta Chamorro about the dispute over the San Juan 
River, which delimits the border between the two countries, 
during her 27 March visit. San Jose Municipality invited 
Chamorro to visit Costa Rica to open the Nicaragua Park in this 
capital. She will seize the opportunity to meet with Calderon. 
  The dispute emerged over an alleged five-dollar charge, 
which 
is considered illegal by Costa Rican authorities, collected from 
tourists navigating along the San Juan River which delimits 
almost 200 of the 320 km that the two countries share. 
  Last weekend the Costa Rican president hinted that the next 
administration, which will be inaugurated on 8 May, could take 
this dispute to the International Court of Justice, 
headquartered at The Hague (the Netherlands), in case it cannot 
be solved through other means. Calderon today stressed the 
cordial relationship between Costa Rica and Nicaragua and said 
that he will talk to Chamorro to find a solution to the said 
charge which Nicaraguan authorities consider legal. 
  Nicaragua has sovereignty over the San Juan River, which 
drains Lake Nicaragua, but according to border treaties signed 
last century, Costa Rica also has the right to navigate it 
freely. Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus today told 
ACAN-EFE that the matter could be taken to the International 
Court of Justice at The Hague, but he is hopeful it can be 
solved through talks between the two nations. He said that he 
hoped to talk today to his Nicaraguan counterpart, Ernesto Leal, 
to find a solution to this problem, which arose due to Costa 
Rican tourist enterprises.

<F P=106> [News conference by Presidency Minister Oscar Santamaria, </F>
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria, and Human Rights 
Commissioner Benjamin Cestoni, with foreign and domestic 
reporters and an unidentified moderator at the Presidential 
Palace in San Salvador -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Santamaria] Domestic and foreign reporters, we 
want to announce that this morning we will be holding the 
regularly scheduled presidential news conference from the 
Presidential Palace. The president sends his regards because he 
cannot be with you this morning. Therefore, I will answer your 
questions during the president's weekly news conference. 
  This morning we want to inform all of the media in 
attendance 
that at the beginning of this news conference we will discuss an 
issue of utmost importance. It is the human rights issue. 
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria and presidential Human 
Rights Commissioner Benjamin Cestoni are here with us this 
morning. Cestoni recently returned from the 50th Annual 
Conference on Human Rights at Geneva. Previously, the foreign 
minister himself had been in Geneva. 
  We want to devote the first part of this morning's news 
conference to this issue -- an issue we consider having the 
utmost importance. We want to report to you that the government 
is very satisfied that in Geneva, Switzerland, a conference took 
place in which our country was included on the agenda -- the UN 
agenda on human rights policy as discussed by the Human Rights 
Commission that meets annually in Geneva. The conference was 
held within this framework. 
  The Salvadoran case was analyzed from the different points 
of 
view. Diverse individuals who have dealt with the human rights 
issue in our country took part in the conference -- namely, the 
Human Rights Prosecutor's Office; Onusal's [UN Observers for El 
Salvador] Human Rights Division, which also travelled to Geneva; 
and, of course, the Salvadoran Government through its permanent 
mission in Geneva. In addition, high-level government officials 
also travelled to Geneva, as I have already mentioned. The 
foreign minister and the presidential commissioner on human 
rights also discussed the issue and presented arguments we 
believe should be publicized in terms of El Salvador's human 
rights policy. 
  We were able to establish that marked progress has been made 
here in respecting human rights; this is evident. Based on 
this, we have been working on a consistent, sustained policy to 
improve and strengthen human rights. Proof of this has been the 
diverse forums in which this issue has been discussed. During 
the past year, numerous contributions have been made in this 
area. Other human rights representatives who, on one occasion 
or another, have visited the nation also have witnessed this. 
  In turn, we were able to make a presentation that we 
considered fundamental. This contributed to the fact that at 
the conclusion of the conference, the commission decided that 
the Salvadoran case should be included in an agenda different 
from the one in which it had been included up until this point. 
We contended that the Salvadoran case should be viewed from 
various perspectives. We want to be honest, and we want to be 
realistic. Taking into account the progress we have made, El 
Salvador should be encouraged in its human rights policy and not 
be subjected to disciplinary action or punishment. 
  Sometimes it seems that evaluations by international 
organizations on a given country's human rights situation focus 
on what that country should do. We think we have done a lot. 
Indeed, we have done a lot, and you are witnesses to the fact 
that here we have not only one but a number of mechanisms that 
have contributed to our human rights policy. They have all been 
contributing. We have a Human Rights Division, which is part of 
a human rights verification and promotion mechanism; we have a 
Human Rights Ombudsman's Office, which also verifies and 
promotes human rights; and we also have a presidential 
commissioner for human rights as part of a policy that we 
consistently carry out. Human rights are also handled by way of 
an independent expert. As mentioned on previous occasions, the 
expert has also been involved in human rights within the 
country. We can possibly say that few countries have as many 
mechanisms dealing with the verification and promotion of human 
rights as El Salvador. 
  Nevertheless, I think there comes a time when a country 
shows 
proof and must say: We have progressed so much that we think the 
policy should be handled differently, especially at the level of 
international organizations. This is exactly what we did in 
Geneva. We said that the Salvadoran case should be seen from a 
different viewpoint or perspective, and that our progress has 
been so significant and evident that we have sufficient reasons 
and arguments to support our request. This is what the 
international community heard. 
  Although the role of the expert continues to exist -- and we 
have stated that there is reason for this -- his role, his 
function, is totally different from the one he had in the 
previous period. This is stated in the resolution I am going to 
quickly read. 
  In (?Point 2), it states: The commission decides to extend 
for one year the mandate of the independent expert for the 
purpose of facilitating the advisory services for El Salvador 
and of informing, in close cooperation with the Human Rights 
Division in El Salvador and the Salvadoran Government, the Human 
Rights Commission in its (?21st) period of sessions -- in other 
words, next year -- regarding the evolution of human rights in 
El Salvador as part of the Advisory Service on the Topic of 
Human Rights. This is the name of the program we now have. 
  This is the government's achievement we mentioned earlier. 
We are no longer under a process of observation concerning 
violations of human rights. Instead, we have come under a 
program which, as you heard, gives advice on human rights. This 
is the context within which the Salvadoran case has been seen by 
the authorities of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, and 
this is the treatment the country is now being given. 
  There has been a favorable response. We see that the 
objective that took us to Geneva has been achieved. We went to 
explain our reasons for the Salvadoran's being viewed from 
another perspective and to say that we were willing to work in 
the area of human rights within the framework of strengthening 
and promoting those rights in El Salvador. 
  Messrs. members of the press, El Salvador receives this 
resolution as encouragement, as a vote of confidence for the 
work we have carried out. We think it is consistent with the 
reality of the country's situation. This was my introduction in 
which I wanted to tell you how the topic was viewed and 
addressed. If you have any questions for me, the foreign 
minister, or the presidential commissioner for human rights, I 
hope you will ask them within the context of this topic I am 
discussing. Thank you. After we address this topic, they will 
leave and I will stay here to answer questions on other topics 
you regularly ask me about. 
  [Moderator] Mr. Mario Jovel from the "Up to Date" newscast. 
  [Jovel] Good morning, Mr. Minister. I would like to know the 
difference between the function or role that the special 
rapporteur on human rights had before and the one he has now. 
If the international community's eyes are no longer on the 
country, might not this lead to the reemergence of lack of 
respect for basic rights? 
  [Santamaria] I would like the presidential commissioner, who 
arrived last night, to explain the context of the resolution. 
  [Cestoni] Thank you, Mr. Minister. Look, the difference is 
substantial in terms of procedure. First of all, as the 
minister read in the resolution, the report must be drawn up in 
close cooperation with the Salvadoran Government. There must be 
coordination on the information when providing a report to the 
commission; this is done as part of the advisory process. 
Previously, the report by the independent expert was based -- 
and [words indistinct] could contain this -- especially on the 
analysis of human rights violations. 
  The topic is very specific. Topic 12 is called Violation of 
Human Rights, and it is the topic under which El Salvador was 
observed for 11 years. Beginning now -- and this is related to 
your second question -- the advisory service is precisely 
designed to strengthen the mechanisms that the country or the 
international community have to protect human rights in any 
country. In other words, we think that via the institutional 
mechanisms we have as a government, we can handle the human 
rights situation under standards acceptable to the international 
community. 
  I want to tell you and the other reporters here that there 
is 
no country in the world that is exempt from observation by the 
international community in Geneva. The topic covers the 
violation of human rights anywhere in the world. This means 
that these violations might exist anywhere in the world. 
Nevertheless, I want to be very specific in stating that in the 
case of El Salvador, the advisory service and our mechanisms 
have led to the establishment of a favorable climate for full 
respect for human rights. 
  [Santamaria] I would also like to ask the foreign minister 
to 
comment on the last part of what you said [words indistinct] or 
not. 
  [Salaverria] I do not think so, but before that I would like 
to tell you about the strategy we have followed with the human 
rights commissioner and the Presidency minister. The Foreign 
Ministry carried out a strategy to obtain the support of all the 
diplomatic representatives in El Salvador. We also wrote to all 
our ambassadors abroad. I directly addressed the foreign 
ministers, and the president also held discussions with all the 
presidents who could help us in Geneva. By way of this 
strategy, we presented ourselves in Geneva to explain that El 
Salvador did not deserve to be included in the group of human 
rights violators. What we wanted was to be removed from that 
group to alleviate doubts about whether El Salvador was a 
violator of human rights. I think we have been successful. Dr. 
Santamaria has already read the part of the resolution in which 
the commission decided what it will do with El Salvador. But, 
if you read the entire resolution, it commends El Salvador. All 
of the paragraphs commend the work that has been done and the 
progress we have attained. 
  Now, to be practical and to answer your question, we have 
150 
human rights observers here. They are working very successfully 
and have helped El Salvador a great deal. 
  The appointment of a human rights adviser by the UN 
secretary 
general represents additional assistance we are receiving. This 
is stated in Point 9, which says: We ask the UN secretary 
general to provide the Salvadoran Government with the counseling 
services requested through the Human Rights Center. In 
practical terms, there is absolutely no difference between 
having 150, 151, or 160 human rights advisers. The job they are 
carrying out is destined to help the Salvadoran Government 
improve its human rights situation. Ultimately, I think the 
process will help us have a better society that will serve as an 
example for the rest of the world. 
  [Moderator] Thank you, Mr. Minister. Jorge Barahona of El 
Salvador's Teleprensa. 
  [Barahona] Good day. Mr. Pedro Nikkem is the UN special 
human rights rapporteur. A few days ago, he prepared a report 
with which you disagreed. My question is this: Is this human 
rights adviser the same Mr. Nikkem who drafted the report 
critical of El Salvador? If so, did you request that Mr. Nikkem 
not be reappointed human rights rapporteur? Would not the 
appointment of this gentleman place the government in the same 
situation as before? 
  [Santamaria] I am going to ask the peace commissioner to 
answer your question. 
  [Cestoni] We did not disagree with the Nikkem report. What 
happened was perhaps a lack of communication on Nikkem's arrival 
in the country. I had the opportunity to speak to him on 
Friday. We both expressed satisfaction that mechanisms will be 
sought to enable him to carry out his mandate. I want to tell 
you that regardless of the name of the person appointed by the 
UN secretary general, whether Nikkem or someone else, we will 
assist him or her in carrying out his or her duty. 
  I also want to tell you that a new position has been created 
by the United Nations. This position is the UN high 
commissioner for human rights. Dr. Jose Ayala Lasso is the 
first UN high commissioner for human rights. He was elected and 
appointed last November in New York. The Salvadoran delegation 
had the opportunity to get in touch with him to review the human 
rights mechanism carried out worldwide by the United Nations. 
  I say this because the new procedures may permit us to have 
the same human rights rapporteur or replace that person or seek 
other mechanisms. The thing is that there is now within the 
United Nations a Human Rights Center, where there are many 
individuals capable of serving as a human rights adviser. This 
will be a decision of the UN secretary general. We hope that 
any person appointed fulfills the mandate of advising us. In 
this regard, we want to make it clear that all countries, 
especially El Salvador, will always require counseling in human 
rights affairs. 
  [Barahona] If Mr. Nikkem is appointed once more, would you 
consider this as a defeat [words indistinct]? 
  [Cestoni] No, no, quite the contrary. If a person is allowed 
to continue in one position... [pauses] I want to make it clear 
we have nothing personal against Dr. Pedro Nikkem. We clarified 
this with Mr. Nikkem last Friday. We appreciate him very much, 
because he has been close to the negotiation process since day 
one. We want to make it very clear that we have nothing 
personal against Nikkem. We simply want the mechanisms provided 
by the United Nations to be definite to enable us to prepare 
reports jointly. As you may recall, before now he was allowed 
to prepare reports without even coming here. The idea is now we 
will work closely together in drafting reports. At the end of 
the news conference, you will receive copies of the resolution, 
and this will give you a chance to read the part on cooperation 
with the Salvadoran Government. 
  [Moderator] Thank you. Ismael Beltran of EL DIARIO DE HOY. 
  [Beltran] Good morning, Mr. Foreign Minister. It is still 
unclear to me as to whether El Salvador has been exempted from 
the group of countries considered to be human rights violators 
-- a group in which we have been included in the past. Did you 
manage to get us out of this group or are we still there? 
  [Salaverria] I can tell you that there are three categories. 
Point 12 includes countries considered to be human rights 
violators. El Salvador has never been included there. El 
Salvador was included in the so-called Point 3 group, which 
includes countries that were under observation and that may be 
placed on the list of human rights violators or under the 
category of those countries that must have a human rights 
adviser. 
  Therefore, our achievement stems from the fact that we have 
moved onto the category of those countries that are assigned an 
adviser, which can only benefit El Salvador. It was a shame 
that Mr. Nikkem could not come to El Salvador, but this was 
mainly due to a misinterpretation -- to poor communication. 
Nikkem was appointed as the expert to advise El Salvador in 
July 1992, and his term expired in July 1993. In July, no one 
told us, however, that his appointment had been renewed. After 
his term expired, he wanted to come to El Salvador, and we asked 
on what grounds he was going to visit our country because we had 
never received notice that his appointment had been renewed. It 
was not that we opposed his visit, but we wanted to know the 
reason for it. Later, we were given the news that his 
appointment had been confirmed in July. Unfortunately, by that 
time Mr. Nikkem had become upset and said he no longer wanted to 
come to El Salvador. 
  Despite all of this, we are on friendly terms with him, and 
we do not believe he is trying to hurt us for the sake of 
hurting us. It is a shame that Nikkem could not come to witness 
the changes that have taken place in recent months, and that his 
report was solely based on his observations during the months of 
August, September, and October of last year. 
  Other human rights delegates who are visiting El Salvador 
also attended the meeting in Geneva. For instance, Dr. Garcia 
Sayan was there, and he issued a very positive statement for the 
Salvadoran Government regarding the progress achieved in the 
area of human rights. I believe we are at a position where we 
can deal with anyone, be it Nikkem or any other person, on a 
friendly basis. 
  [Moderator] Thank you, Mr. Minister. 
  [Salaverria] Excuse me. I need just another minute. I want 
to make an observation: No country can be exempted from these 
groups overnight. There is a procedure to be followed in this 
organization. Things must be done and undone in a uniform 
manner. Therefore, just as we entered gradually and ascended to 
the top, we have also been exiting gradually. First, we were in 
Point 12, where we stayed for a while, and later, last year, we 
moved on to Point 3 -- where we might remain or be removed. 
Today, we have reached the last phase of this process, in which 
we have virtually gone through all observation mechanisms. 
Currently, we have moved from the observation mechanisms to the 
counseling stage, which is like going from night to day. 
  [Moderator] Thank you. Mr. Raul Mengen of Radiocenter 
network is next. [Words indistinct] Mr. Fausto Valladares of 
Megavision. 
  [Santamaria] I want to know whether you have any more 
questions on the human rights issue, because our colleagues will 
be leaving now. If not, we will drop the subject now. 
  [Valladares] Does this mean, then, that the [word 
indistinct] 
will not be able to report if there is a deterioration in human 
rights? He will not be able to... 
  [Santamaria, interrupting] Look, I want to clarify one 
thing. 
The report can contain his perception of the country. We are 
not denying his legitimate right to report whether there are 
human rights violations in El Salvador, or whether we are moving 
backward instead of forward. No, that is not the mandate. The 
mandate involves obtaining broad powers to be able to report a 
country's reality. 
  In this case, we managed to ensure that the report will be 
written in an atmosphere of close collaboration between Onusal 
and the Salvadoran Government. Why? To ensure an agreement 
between the time in which an event occurs and the time of the 
release of the report, because at times, as was the case today, 
he could base his work on a three-month-old report because he 
was unable to come to El Salvador. Perhaps this report did not 
reflect the country's true reality when he arrived in El 
Salvador. 
  We have never denied reality. We have welcomed harsh 
criticism. Remember, we have faced very delicate and serious 
problems. In the past there was talk about serious human rights 
violations in El Salvador. Therefore, I think [words 
indistinct] the resolution mentions the word offense. In other 
words, the language that is already being used to describe El 
Salvador is completely different. He, however -- and this point 
is important -- is free to draft his report without having to 
overcome any government obstacles. He is free to draft his 
report as he sees fit. 
  [Valladares] At any rate, does this not imply that El 
Salvador is under permanent observation? 
  [Santamaria] No, it does not imply being under permanent 
observation, because, as I said, it is one thing to seek advice 
to open a business; if you want to buy a house, however, you go 
to someone to advise you on whether it is a good house, while it 
is another thing be told you cannot buy the house because you 
are unable to buy it. [sentence as heard] In other words, we are 
talking about two completely different issues -- two completely 
different analyses of the situation. I want to say that this 
does not mean El Salvador has reached the end of the line, as is 
the case with many countries. We are trying to strengthen 
mechanisms to reach satisfactory goals. 
  [Moderator] Are there any other questions on this topic? 
  [Unidentified reporter] [words indistinct] there seems to be 
some confusion as to what entails advisory and observation. If 
this rapporteur appointed by the UN is going to be in our 
country, or if he is going to remain in our country long enough 
to prepare a report, will he not have already served in some 
advisory capacity? Moreover, from the moment the individual 
arrives in El Salvador he will be observing human rights issues, 
either violations or observance of fundamental rights. Then, 
according to the United Nations, the person appointed... 
  [Santamaria, interrupting] Of course. It is a fact that in 
order to advise, the person must first evaluate. If someone is 
asked to repair a house, I believe an engineer would first have 
to check the foundations, the walls, and so on. We could 
describe that process as the evaluation stage. Now, for him to 
evaluate how we can overcome these difficult problems, we will 
find that he will most likely suggest that in order for El 
Salvador not to find itself in a position -- such as the one our 
reporter friend here described as a human rights violator, as 
classified by the international community -- then we must 
increase this or that procedure, issues must be reviewed, and 
certain institutions must be strengthened. In other words, the 
general idea is that he is going to guide us in a way that, at 
the end of the process, which is next year, we... [pauses] Just 
to give you an example, by November when the next UN General 
Assembly session takes place, it will not even be necessary to 
discuss the Salvadoran issue anymore. By November we will have 
been excluded from the General Assembly agenda. Today we are 
being taken off of the Human Rights Commission agenda. In other 
words, this detail is very important because, as I explained to 
my friend here, there are steps to be followed. Listen very 
carefully. In terms of New York -- the UN General Assembly -- we 
have already been taken off of the agenda. In order words, El 
Salvador is not going to be included on the agenda for this 
year. In February 1995, at the Human Rights Commission, we will 
also be taken off of the agenda. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [words indistinct] that our country 
is excluded at the international level [words indistinct] but in 
another analysis made in this case by the UN appointee [words 
indistinct] human rights violation? 
  [Cestoni] Of course. The issue here is human rights. He 
will come to analyze the human rights situation. If he 
perceives that in the next eight or nine months we in El 
Salvador experience a setback in human rights -- let us hope 
this does not happen -- and there are serious violations, he 
will obviously report them. No one can prevent the human rights 
rapporteur from doing so. What we as government, people, and 
society must do is to try to ensure that such a report, which 
must be based on a true account of reality, be as effective as 
possible in reflecting an improvement in the human rights 
situation. 
  Let me add something else. When a government wants to do 
something right, it does not wait for others to tell it what to 
do. That is why it has been made clear that when the Salvadoran 
Government requires counseling, the UN secretary general is 
obliged to provide it. If we feel we need UN counseling, we 
will request it; the United Nations does not necessarily have to 
offer it. It can work both ways. 
  [Santamaria] I do not know if you have any more questions on 
this topic. If you do not, I would like to thank the foreign 
minister and presidential human rights commissioner for their 
presence here to answer the reporters' questions. 
  [Unidentified station announcer] We are broadcasting live 
from the Presidential Palace. Dr. Santamaria continues to speak. 
  [Moderator] [words indistinct] Raul Monge of Cadena Radio 
Sol. 
  [Monge] During the past decade, the FMLN [Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front] described the elections as an 
electoral farce. Do you believe, as a government, that the 
participation today of the FMLN in the electoral process, based 
on peace accords, is sincere? Do you believe the FMLN will let 
you govern if it fails to win the elections? 
  [Santamaria] Well, I think that the credibility and 
confidence in one's actions is generated by deeds, not words. 
However, this is the first time the FMLN has taken part in an 
elections process. All Salvadoran citizens are aware of this 
fact. If we base our opinion on words, particularly those from 
the FMLN's top leaders -- namely, that they will respect the 
results, regardless of who wins; that their participation will 
strengthen the democratic process; and that this is the 
objective of the FMLN's political participation -- then we would 
have to believe that we are witnessing a strengthening of 
democracy in El Salvador. This involves not only respecting 
election results, but also respecting government actions 
exercised by one person as part of the responsibilities of 
exercising the government. [sentence as heard] 
  We believe words must be accompanied by deeds. This is yet 
to be seen. I cannot give you any real opinions. Nevertheless, 
what we have heard is that the FMLN will respect the elections. 
In fact, this morning I heard an FMLN leader speak of accepting 
the results. He said the FMLN definitely wanted to return to 
civilian life, adding that overcoming the armed conflict was an 
irreversible reality. We hope that the FMLN keeps its word. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Moderator] Ismael Beltran from EL DIARIO DE HOY. 
  [Beltran] Good morning. Last week there were attacks during 
several political rallies. One deputy who was hit in the eye 
said political terrorism exists. What does the government plan 
to do to prevent this? Will it protect political rallies and 
motorcades? 
  [Santamaria] The cases that have occurred have affected some 
political organizations. The PCN [National Conciliation Party] 
is one of them. You remember that the PCN already reported an 
incident at a public rally in an outlying city. It has now 
happened to a mayoral candidate and his delegation, who were 
attacked in a San Salvador market. Another member of Arena 
[Nationalist Republican Alliance] was also attacked during a 
visit to Apopa municipality. 
  We are completely opposed to these actions, and we condemn 
such actions. This is really incompatible with what we are 
trying to promote. We are trying to promote the consolidation 
of the peace process and a culture of peace. This brings to 
mind what we have just done in this country. The behavior, 
attitude, and the way people act in these cases all contradict 
the peace process. Moreover, these things show that there exist 
people who still believe that the way to discuss the country's 
problems is through violence. If we have a political campaign 
and there are political opportunities to air our ideas, there is 
no reason why we should respond in the opposite manner and carry 
out violent actions. This is totally denounced, criticized, and 
condemned by the government. 
  The public security institutions must respond to all reports 
of such actions to guarantee the people's safety. We think that 
those political groups and sectors that are staging these types 
of actions to drive away or intimidate people... [pauses] 
because we think this is perhaps their aim, they want to 
intimidate people so that they will not go to public events to 
support their candidates. We think this must be publicly stated 
because, I repeat, such actions are not compatible with a 
dignified campaign, as Onusal has been requesting. Onusal has 
said the electoral process is admirable. At the same time some 
people are resorting to these low and dirty tricks of attacking 
candidates. We condemn these actions, and the government will 
adopt measures to provide the support that is requested from the 
public security institutions. It will enforce the law in those 
cases in which they must be enforced against those responsible 
for such actions.

  [Text] Yesterday, National Defense Minister Mario Rene 
Enriquez said a plan has been initiated to modernize the Army. 
He added that the plan was designed for 1991 to 2010 and it 
mainly focuses on the education sector. He said that starting 
this year the curriculum of all Polytechnic School graduates 
must include liberal arts classes. He explained that "no one 
will be able to take command or staff courses, meaning no one 
can be promoted to the rank of colonel without a bachelor's or 
master's degree in the field of liberal arts, for example, law, 
medicine, economy, or others." 
  When asked if a reduction was included in the Army 
modernization plan, he said some plans have been prepared for 
implementation when the counterinsurgency struggle ends. These 
plans deal with the relocation of Army units. He said more 
attention will be given to Peten to deal with issues like 
deforestation and the plunder of the country's archaeological 
heritage because it is necessary to maintain the country's 
sovereignty in an area where oil abounds. This is very important 
for the future. "Hopefully, we will reorganize the Army soon. 
Its members will be equitably distributed. This is an 
opportunity to change the quality of their lives and to achieve 
adequate technology for the Corps," he added. 
  Enriquez said he does not share Christian Tomuschat's views 
on the Army's size, adding that the country could easily have an 
155,000-member Army if what was done in El Salvador is done 
here, given the country's size and its demography. He said that 
currently the Army has less than 45,000 members, meaning less 
than 0.05 percent of the population -- 10 million. Civilian 
patrols should not be included in the number because they do not 
earn a salary, they are not armed, and their essential role is 
to protect their children and towns. 
  Defense Minister Matio Enriquez said in response to the 
rebels' claims that the military might have perpetrated the 
attack on the San Juan Bridge, located on the Atlantic coast 
highway: "The only thing I can say is that I cannot conceive of 
anything as absurd as the URNG [Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity] communique" on the San Juan Bridge attack. 
  He reiterated that the military had exerted an effort to 
restore traffic along that important highway; adding he does not 
believe law-abiding people are capable of perpetrating terrorist 
attacks like the most recent one. He also pointed out that the 
URNG admitted on several occasions it considers bridges, 
electric towers, or GUATEL [Guatemalan Telecommunications 
Enterprise] pylons as military targets. "I do not believe the 
military or any other Guatemalan group could created another 
terrorist faction because we are genuinely striving to achieve 
peace rather than to increase poverty and polarization," he 
added. 
  Referring to OAS statements on conscription, he said it must 
be indiscriminate because it is a service, a duty, and a right 
to serve the homeland. "I believe we will have no more problems 
as soon as the Military Service Bill, sent to Congress, is 
approved," he asserted. He said he personally signed the orders 
to all the commanders so the latest military enrollment would be 
voluntary.

<F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Today, acting Government Minister Adolfo Reyes 
Calderon said the government is studying strategies to adopt in 
case there are threats of new riots in Guatemala. This statement 
by Reyes Calderon came one day after a government press 
communique quoted him delivering a strong warning to potential 
riot instigators, who reportedly have been acting within the 
framework of the state employees' strike movement. This 
statement also came at a time when the Army controls the town of 
Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa, the site of violent riots on Tuesday, 
when the local police station was set on fire and many policemen 
were attacked. 
  The incidents resulted from speculation by the townspeople 
about a possible plot between policemen and members of a band of 
traffickers of children, to which Melissa Carol Larson, a North 
American, allegedly belongs. Yesterday Larson was in danger of 
being lynched. 
  Today, Reyes Calderon talked about the measures that could 
be 
adopted, in conjunction with the Attorney General's Office, to 
check threats to national stability. 
  [Begin recording] [Reyes Calderon] Highway Patrol cars and 
other state vehicles have been used. Some people have used 
state gasoline also and are not going to their jobs. They are 
[word indistinct]. For this reason, today, in compliance with 
the law, two pilots were arrested for misusing state funds. The 
attorney general was with us to see that the prosecutors take 
action in the upcoming trials. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Reyes Calderon] No. I did not say that. Right now, six 
people are officially under arrest. They were arrested in 
Quezaltenango. Others are also under arrest. Late in the 
afternoon, a communique will be issued to report on all the 
people who were arrested. I have confirmation that six people 
were arrested but I have been informed that another 11 people 
were arrested in other places. 
  [Reporter] Where is the North American woman being held? 
  [Reyes Calderon] She is under arrest in Esquintla. Today, 
she will be transferred to Santa Teresa in Zone 18. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] the participation of the 
police? 
  [Reyes Calderon] This is a charge that was filed recently. 
The Professional Responsibilities Office [Oficina de 
Responsabilidad Profesional -- ORP] is investigating. I was 
telling your fellow journalists a while ago that the 
administration of Ramiro de Leon Carpio is trying 210 agents for 
various crimes. If anyone is involved, we will act drastically 
and prosecute them in the courts. 
  [Reporter] It has been said that these people are 
trafficking 
human organs. 
  [Reyes Calderon] This is speculation. What happened is that 
there were two children in the morgue, and somebody spread the 
rumor and that is why the townspeople were enraged. There is no 
confirmed case of trafficking human organs in Guatemala. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Reyes Calderon] According to Police Report 54. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Reyes Calderon] Nine people were injured: four citizens and 
five policemen. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Reyes Calderon] Yes, of course, with reinforcements. As you 
know, yesterday, the Army supported us, and this helped restore 
order. 
  [Reporter] What kind of sabotage was done yesterday and what 
kind of sabotage [words indistinct]? 
  [Reyes Calderon] Public buildings were seized; people were 
prevented from exercising their right to move around freely; 
border posts were closed; and public institutions were seized. 
  [Reporter] The Governor's Office was seized and the roads in 
and out of Zacapa were blocked. Did you send riot police? 
  [Reyes Calderon] We sent a police contingent. That is why 
the attorney general came. We discussed all the issues because 
some people are blocking the road to Agua Caliente. Honest 
people, businessmen, and people wanting to engage in commercial 
activities cannot work because people are blocking the road. We 
are going to respect human rights and ask them to leave but if 
they insist on blocking traffic, we will act firmly, as the law 
demands. [end recording] 
  Attorney General Telesforo Guerra Cahn met with the acting 
government minister to coordinate preventive actions in case of 
other riots. Guerra Cahn spoke about this matter following a 
meeting with acting Government Minister Reyes Calderon. 
  [Begin recording] [Guerra] Yesterday, we agreed with the 
government minister that his office would coordinate actions 
with the Attorney General's Office to avoid the public-disorder 
situations that are arising throughout the country. We as 
authorities cannot permit groups to act as they did in [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] What measures will be adopted? 
  [Guerra] Preventive measures [words indistinct] and the 
Attorney General's Office will also participate. We will take 
legal actions against those who are arrested. [Words indistinct] 
investigate charges that the North American woman is involved in 
the trafficking of children because the neighbors have charged 
that there is trafficking in children's organs. 
  I do not want to speculate. Sometimes situations of conflict 
are created. I understand the woman is being held in the 
Esquintla women's prison. She cannot be released without a 
judge's order. Regarding your second question, we have no 
information that she is involved in any such activity. This was 
speculation yesterday and that is what causes mobs to carry out 
actions of violence. [words indistinct] set state property, 
including a police station, on fire, acted disorderly, carried 
out demonstrations, injured and pressured people. Some criminal 
activities were carried out. The judge must decide on this, but 
we are beginning procedures and our prosecutors have been 
brought [words indistinct]. Approximately 52 people are under 
arrest. [end recording]

  [Text] The Guatemalan Foreign Ministry officially announced 
that Guatemalan and Mexican delegations met yesterday at the 
National Palace and agreed to suspend, for an indefinite period, 
Mexico's restrictions affecting migrants on its territory. 
  The meeting, which began at 1100 and was attended by the 
delegates representing both countries, was presided over by 
Francisco Gil Diaz, Mexican undersecretary of finance and public 
credit, and Estuardo Mendez Herbruger, Guatemalan public finance 
vice minister. The delegations agreed that the suspension would 
enter into effect while the search would continue for a definite 
solution that is favorable to both countries. 
  On 24 January, the Mexican finance authorities implemented 
measures directly affecting Guatemalan and Central American 
migrants travelling from the United States and crossing Mexico 
carrying goods and other commodities. Both delegations agreed 
on a study to harmonize timetables along the common border in 
order to prevent bottlenecks in those areas, as well as 
technical cooperation between customs authorities with the 
objective of solving any problems that may rise. 
  Mendez Herbruger stated that both delegations plan to search 
for convenient procedures whereby those who need to cross 
Mexican territory will be able to do so without any delays 
caused by Mexican custom regulations. He indicated that 
Guatemala is evaluating a Mexican proposal because the Mexicans 
reacted to comments forwarded by the Guatemalan authorities, who 
in turn received feedback from the migrants. Therefore, they 
are all working to benefit Central American citizens. 
  On the other hand, Mexican Ambassador Pedro Vasquez 
Colmenares expressed satisfaction with the dialogue that had 
been held and announced that the Mexican authorities had met and 
exchanged opinions with the Salvadoran, Nicaraguan, and Costa 
Rican customs directors at the Central American Integration 
Secretariat.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 7 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- The National 
Federation of Public Employees Unions (FENASEP) of Guatemala 
rejected today, Monday, the 70-quetzal ($12) wage increase and 
the yearly bonus proposed by the government of President Ramiro 
de Leon Carpio. FENASEP Secretary Felix Hernandez asserted that 
his organization, which includes approximately 40,000 public 
employees, cannot accept the increase offered by the economic 
cabinet because it does not fulfill the people's expectations. 
  FENASEP does not support the strikes' being held by 180,000 
public employees and has directly negotiated wage adjustments 
with the government. However, Hernandez reiterated today that 
they have not managed to reach any agreement with the ministers. 
"We cannot accept" the increase offered by the president not 
only because it does not satisfy the needs of the workers but 
because merchants would take advantage of such an increase and 
hike product prices by more than the increase, he stated. 
Hernandez, who has been charged with being a "traitor" by his 
striking union colleagues, said that this Tuesday FENASEP will 
announce the measures it will take and did not reject the call 
to strike if the government does not improve its offer, which 
also includes a yearly bonus of 260 quetzales ($44.80). 
  Meanwhile, the State Workers Unitary Organization (UITE) 
[Instancia Unitaria de Trabajadores del Estado] that has 
semiparalyzed public administration as a pressure mechanism to 
get a 40-percent wage hike, asserted that the labor strike 
initiated five weeks ago will continue. The UITE and the 
National Federation of State Workers Unions (FENASTEG) have also 
rejected the increase, although they admit that their demand for 
a 40-percent increase is negotiable.

  [Text] In an inflexible attitude and rejecting talks to 
study their demands which have been proposed by the government, 
a small group of former Government Ministry soldiers have 
carried out coercive pressure at the UN headquarters. The 
government has decided to discontinue discussing their demands 
until they stop the pressure. The government will enforce the 
state of law and guarantee the country's institutionalization. 
  The Government Ministry was scheduled to meet with this 
group, and Minister Alfredo Mendieta, who has been sick for the 
past three days, authorized a ministry delegation, including 
deputy ministers, to meet with the group. At first, however, the 
protesters stubbornly refused to hold the meeting, demanding 
Minister Mendieta attend the meeting. 
  This same group has occupied the Managua Cathedral twice 
before. They also tried to ruin the awards ceremony when 
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani visited our country 
recently. 
  The government delegation talked to representatives of the 
Nicaraguan Human Rights Center to persuade it to convince the 
protesters to change their minds regarding their demands that 
the minister be present at the meeting. The protesters agreed 
but, at the same time, a small group of protesters began 
exerting pressure at the UN headquarters. The government 
decided not to continue talking to them until they stop exerting 
pressure at the UN headquarters. The Government Ministry 
reiterates its willingness to advance the state of law and 
guarantee the democratic development of the country's 
institutionalization. 
  [Panama City ACAN in Spanish at 0029 GMT on 10 Mar 94 cites 
Managua radio stations as reporting that "at least 50 former 
Sandinist soldiers occupied today, Wednesday, the building where 
the UN headquarters is located in Nicaragua to pressure Violeta 
Chamorro's government to compensate them for retiring to 
civilian life." ACAN adds that according to media sources, the 
former soldiers "are holding Francesco Vincenti, UN 
representative in Nicaragua, at the UN installation," and they 
want him to mediate to get the Nicaraguan Government to accept 
their demands. The report adds: "A riot police contingent has 
cordoned off the UN building, located near Plaza Espana, in the 
southwestern part of Managua."]

  [Text] A group of former Government Ministry soldiers 
occupied the UN offices in Nicaragua for several hours yesterday 
afternoon and evening. Hours after the seizure of the UN 
offices, during which 10 officials were held captive, the former 
soldiers went to the Government Ministry to begin negotiating 
their demands with Deputy Ministers Joaquin Lovo and Frank Cesar 
Reyes. The former soldiers, who arrived with their faces covered 
with red handkerchiefs, were led by Marvin Miranda. They 
demanded prompt compensation for their years of service during 
the former Sandinist regime.

<F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] has 
apologized to the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] for the 
incidents of aggression against the latter in La Chorrera. The 
PRD leaders said they will submit to the investigations by the 
Justice and Peace Commission, and, if the accusations turn out 
to be true, they are going to take the appropriate measures. 
The PDC members directly accuse Mr. Harmodio Estribi of being 
the promoter of these aggressions. Mitchell Doens, secretary 
general of the PRD, said that in his talks with Estribi, he 
concludes there were in fact attacks on the PDC in La Chorrera 
but not to the extent denounced by the PDC. 
  [Begin recording] [Doens] Estribi publicly asked the PDC for 
explanations of the incidents that took place. He asked for 
explanations of the flag incidents. Certain flags were grabbed 
and the like. We have instructed him to talk to the PDC leaders 
in La Chorrera to clear up these incidents and prevent them from 
reoccurring in the future. Those are the instructions we gave 
companero Harmodio Estribi. 
  [Unidentified reporter] So an incident did in fact occur. 
  [Doens] There was an incident, there was some pushing and 
shoving when the motorcade went by. The people who were present 
shouted a few things at each other, and as a result flags were 
suddenly grabbed. I insist that the incidents are being 
exaggerated to the point that some published media seem to be in 
collusion to do this. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Deborah Berlinck] </F>
  [Excerpts] Geneva -- "Neglect" and "savagery" were the 
terms used by the United States to once again report the 
situation of poverty and the killing of children in Brazil. 
Before a plenary packed with diplomats from almost 100 
countries who are participating in the UN Human Rights 
Commission's annual meeting, U.S. representative Vivian Derryck 
startled Brazilian diplomats by saying that "in Brazil, street 
children search through litter to find food and sometimes are 
hunted for sport." [passage omitted] 
  Caught by surprise by the criticism leveled by the U.S. 
delegation, the Brazilian delegation immediately delivered a 
lukewarm speech prepared the day before. In its speech, the 
Brazilian delegation again asked the international community for 
enhanced efforts to offer technical cooperation and other 
methods of assistance to those countries requiring assistance. 
Two pages of the Brazilian delegation's speech were dedicated 
to the Brazilian Government's successes, ranging from the 
eradication of poliomielitis "in three years" to the campaign 
against hunger devised by sociologist Herbert de Souza, alias 
Betinho. 
  Brazil's official response to the hard overtones of the 
criticism leveled by the U.S. delegation during the UN Human 
Rights Commission's annual meeting came at the end of the 
meeting through a passionate protest speech delivered by 
Brazilian Ambassador Gilberto Saboia. Following is the 
ambassador's speech: 
  "Exercising its right to a response, the Brazilian 
delegation 
wants to express its surprise over and disagreement with the 
remarks on Brazil made by the U.S. delegation. 
  "To mention Brazil as a country that deliberately neglects 
children not only represents a false argument vis-a-vis the 
facts, but also contradicts the opinion voiced by UNICEF and 
other international authorities in this field. The Brazilian 
delegation is ready to furnish the U.S. delegation a copy of a 
report the Brazilian delegation distributed among 
nongovernmental organizations and UN Human Rights Commission 
countries, describing in detail the actions and programs 
implemented in Brazil in favor of children. 
  "The allegation that children in Brazil are "hunted for 
sport" is totally unacceptable and demonstrates the U.S. 
delegation's lack of objectivity and lack of information on our 
country's reality. In addition, as demonstrated by the 1994 
UNICEF report, we note that the United States does not have the 
required authority in this field to use this peremptory and 
disqualifying language with regard to other countries. 
  "As UNICEF Executive Director James Grant said recently, 20 
children are shot to death in the United States of America every 
day and the situation of children from minorities such as 
Afro-Americans and Hispanics is comparable to the situation of 
some underdeveloped countries."

  [Text] Brasilia, 9 Mar (EFE) -- Acting Brazilian Foreign 
Minister Roberto Abdenur today protested the harsh U.S. 
criticism of Brazil before the UN Human Rights Commission over 
the killing of a large number of abandoned children. 
  Foreign Ministry sources said Abdenur used the occasion of a 
meeting with Mark Lora, the U.S. charge d'affaires in Brasilia, 
to express the Brazilian Government's "displeasure" over the 
U.S. criticism. 
  The acting Brazilian foreign minister pointed out that the 
language used by the U.S. delegation in Geneva to discuss the 
situation of abandoned minors in Brazil was "senseless, 
improper, inopportune, and unfair." 
  Vivian Derryck, the U.S. representative to the UN Human 
Rights Commission, accused the Brazilian Government on 8 March 
in Geneva of committing "savagery" concerning the abandoned 
minors. 
  According to local humanitarian organizations, an average of 
four abandoned minors are killed in Brazil every day. 
  Abdenur and Lora also discussed the meeting's original 
purpose, namely drawing up the agenda for a visit U.S. Vice 
President Albert Gore will pay to Brasilia on 21 March, the last 
leg of a tour that also will take him to Buenos Aires and La Paz. 
  In the Brazilian capital, Gore will meet the president of 
the 
Republic, Itamar Franco, with whom he will discuss bilateral 
relations and a projected hemispheric summit the United States 
plans to stage in its territory at an as-yet-undetermined date 
this year.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Paulo Sotero in Washington, D.C.] </F>
  [Text] The talk took place at OAS headquarters during the 
evening of 3 March, during a farewell cocktail party in honor of 
Brazilian Ambassador to the OAS Bernardo Pericas. Encouraged by 
the Mexican Government's decision to speed up its political 
reforms, and by the possible success of the FHC2 [Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso 2] program, a high-ranking White House adviser 
for Latin American affairs shared the splendid scenario that he 
had in mind with two Brazilians. 
  "We could have -- in a matter of months -- democracy in 
Mexico and the stabilization of the Brazilian economy under 
way," he said. He could have added that the two major stumbling 
blocks for Washington's integration policy in the hemisphere 
would thus be overcome. Brazil is perhaps likely to curb 
inflation sooner than a Mexico under President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari becomes a democratic state. The government's opponents 
in Brazil, at least, do not have hide their identities behind 
masks when they negotiate with authorities, as is the case with 
the Indians from Chiapas who rose in revolt. 
  In any case, one of the Brazilians who took part in this 
conversation -- a senior Brazilian representative before the OAS 
-- took up Clinton's aide on that point, in order to reiterate 
the importance of U.S. support for the Brazilian economic 
program. "Whoever opposes an agreement between Brazil and the 
IMF will be responsible for a great harm inflicted not only upon 
Brazil, but upon the international financial system as well," he 
said. 
  This utterance hints at two things. First, one can hardly 
expect that the gap between the economic team's estimates and 
those of the IMF, as far as the budget is concerned, will be 
bridged with a calculator. Once again, the IMF management and 
the governments from the seven most powerful industrial 
countries, which are in control of the majority of votes at the 
IMF executive board, will have to make a political gamble and 
approve a stand-by arrangement with Brazil. 
  IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus got his fingers 
burned 
the last two times he adopted a receptive stance on the 
Brazilian program. He has already told Cardoso that unless he 
is convinced of the soundness and political feasibility of the 
FHC2 plan he will not put the IMF's credibility in jeopardy. 
  The second hint included in the Brazilian official's remark 
to Clinton's aide is a warning: If the IMF and the U.S. 
Government refuse to support Brazil's current economic policy, 
they will make the country embark upon a path that is opposite 
to that of stabilization, and will for all practical purposes 
line up the voters in support of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's 
presidential candidacy. 
  The decisive step in the negotiations with the IMF started 
on 
4 March. Based on the results of the technical evaluation by 
the IMF mission to Brazil and on an analysis of Brazilian 
political situation, Camdessus will have to decide whether he 
endorses the Brazilian economic program. He must reach a 
decision by next weekend so that Brazil can then work out an 
agreement with creditor banks by 15 April. 
  Washington's skepticism toward the Brazilian economic 
program 
was broken last week by economist Albert Fishlow, a Brazilian 
scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. A pessimist 
in his analysis of Brazilian business cycles, Fishlow accurately 
forecast the failure of several Brazilian attempts to curb 
inflation since the Cruzado Plan in 1986. 
  On 4 March, however, he surprised an audience comprised of 
the upper echelons of the U.S. Government, high-ranking members 
of international organizations, and Latin American experts from 
leading Washington "think tanks" when stating that "the new 
stabilization program will probably be a complete success." 
Addressing a seminar on the economic integration of the 
Americas sponsored by the Inter-American Dialogue, Fishlow gave 
three reasons for his optimistic forecast. The first was that 
unlike previous programs, the current one is based on a strong 
fiscal policy. 
  The high level of foreign exchange reserves that the country 
has gives the government plenty of leeway. Finally, the 
economist noted that the program is politically coherent, as it 
may catapult Cardoso into the presidency. Clinton's aide -- who 
was present at this seminar -- did not seem to be very much 
convinced. "Fishlow's friendship with Cardoso may have impaired 
the former's prowess at analysis," he said. And yet he arrived 
at the OAS cocktail some hours later dreaming about the idea 
that Brazil would stabilize its economy and that Mexico would 
become a democratic country "in a matter of months."

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi de La Guaird] </F>
  [Text] An Itamaraty source reported that Brazilian foreign 
policy's political priority is to obtain a permanent seat on the 
UN Security Council. The government is negotiating a virtual 
Brazilian candidacy -- parallel to the candidacy of countries 
such as India, Japan, and Germany -- but keeping in sight that 
"the regional component is the most sensitive one." 
  Venezuelan Foreign Ministry sources told this newspaper that 
they are only supporting the Japanese and German candidacies for 
the new permanent seats that may be created in the UN Security 
Council. So far, Brazil is not a Venezuelan Foreign Ministry 
favorite. 
  Argentina, the main Brazilian partner in the region, prefers 
to support Japan instead of favoring the Brazilian aspiration. 
  The issue, however, requires that diplomats be careful not 
to 
offend partner countries. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim does not 
want to comment on the Argentine position. He only notes that 
the issue was "frankly" discussed during his meeting with 
Argentine Defense Minister Oscar Camilion in Brasilia a few days 
ago. Amorim added: "Camilion said the issue must be dealt with 
carefully because it is not ripe and this is understandable. We 
are trying to talk matters over and reach understandings." 
  According to the minister, the ideal thing would be not to 
have permanent UN Security Council members. "In the world, 
however, there are five countries (the United States, France, 
the PRC, Russia, and England) that will not give up being 
permanent members. The world has changed. The council will have 
to be expanded. Brazil believes this expansion will not increase 
the current imbalances and does not want to see only certain 
types of countries receiving privileges. This would not be good 
for the Security Council," Amorim says. 
  According to the foreign minister, the adoption of similar 
positions by Latin American countries that will be represented 
by Brazil in the UN Security Council -- Brazil's name has been 
raised by the UN secretary general, and "whenever the issue is 
discussed, its name crops up naturally" -- may, however, run 
into difficulties, particularly regarding Argentina. 
  There is still some animosity in the region about eventual 
Brazilian hegemonic attitudes. A diplomatic source explained to 
this newspaper: "The issue lies in how our neighbors will take 
the idea." The Foreign Ministry's assessment, however, is that 
during the second stage, when discussions for expanding the 
number of UN Security Council members reaches the point of 
defining these new members, Argentina will support Brazil's 
candidacy. 
  The idea of expanding the UN Security Council was raised two 
years ago and is supported by the United States, which even 
accepts the inclusion of more than five members without veto 
power. The voting is scheduled to be held during the 1995 UN 
General Assembly that will be attended by 184 UN members. But 
Article 108 of the UN Charter establishes that all Security 
Council decisions must be approved at the national level by each 
of the five permanent UN Security Council members that can block 
the decision. 
  Brazil hopes to have the support of all five member 
countries. Moreover, as Foreign Minister Celso Amorim informed 
this newspaper on 4 March, Brazilian diplomacy does not hide its 
satisfaction at receiving a letter a few days ago from U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher praising Brazil's 
participation in the discussions on the former Yugoslavia. 
Amorim noted that Ronaldo Sardenberg, the Brazilian ambassador 
to the United Nations, heads the Security Council's Sanctions 
Committee. Brazil, like Argentina, has been participating in 
the council for a two-year period as a rotating member. 
  According to Ambassador Jose Viegas Filho, under secretary 
of 
the Foreign Ministry Political Planning Department, the General 
Assembly has established a working group that already has held 
two sessions. The UN Security Council's expansion aims to reduce 
regional imbalance. Except for China, the five members with 
veto power are almost all developed countries. There are no 
representatives from Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, or 
Africa. 
  Brazilian diplomacy has been working on several fronts to 
spread the image that Brazil is a reliable country and "a center 
of stability" in the region, where it shares borders with 10 
countries and has no disputes. A Foreign Ministry source said: 
"Brazilian nuclear policy today is viewed as reliable and no 
country is asking us to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty." Last week, President Itamar Franco promulgated the 
nuclear safeguard treaty signed by Brazil, Argentina, the 
Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control (ABACC), 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that was 
approved by Congress. 
  Brazil also has signed the treaty proscribing weapons of 
mass 
destruction such as chemical and biological weapons, and 
actively participated in drafting new amendments to the 
Tlatelolco Treaty on the denuclearization of Latin America and 
the Caribbean, but the Senate has yet to approve it. In 1993, 
Brazil headed the Vienna Conference on Human Rights. 
  Although the foreign minister alleges that "Brazil cannot 
nominate itself," and that its name was mentioned because of its 
size and importance -- "Brazil has a face turned to Africa; it 
shares borders with many Latin American countries, and it has a 
tradition of the peaceful solution of controversies" -- 
Brazilian diplomatic circles believe that "its upholding of 
Western diplomatic values and understanding of the problems 
affecting other developing countries" are a plus in favor of 
Brazil.

<F P=106> [By Eduardo Tessler] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- Judge Antonio Carlos Amorim, president of 
the Rio de Janeiro Court, yesterday said that a Brazilian 
political party is being financed with "illegal money" from 
Italy. Without specifying the party, the judge said that it is 
one of the favorite parties for the October elections. In this 
regard he asked for help from his Italian colleagues to 
investigate the trafficking in money and, if possible, to stop 
it. 
  Says Amorim: "Our main concern is that this party could gain 
power in Brazil financed with money produced by illegal 
activities in Italy. This poses a risk for Brazil, which could 
be governed by a party of illegal deals, of illegal money." 
  He added: "I do not know the origin of the money, whether it 
originates with the mafia or with drug trafficking. The 
information was leaked, and I only confirmed it." He was 
referring to an Italian television report that the party is 
being financed by the mafia and by drug trafficking. 
  Amorim met yesterday with Rome District Attorney Vittorio 
Mele and with the group of Italian judges who visited Brazil 
last year to investigate Brazilian links with the Italian 
corruption network: Vittorio Paraggio, Maria Teresa Saragnano, 
and Mario Almerighi. He also met with Justice Minister Giovanni 
Conso. Amorim passed secret information to the judges on 
investments by Italians in Brazil made with money coming from 
illegal sources. 
  He said: "Whoever finances a party abroad, investing cash, 
does it because he expects a major economic return in the 
future. In my capacity as a judge I cannot identify the party, 
despite the fact that everyone in Brazil knows which party it 
is. It is a party with strong candidates for the October 
elections, and which wants to gain power." 
  Amorim also met with Giovanni Galloni, the vice president of 
the Superior Council of Magistrates, with whom he exchanged 
views on the work of the courts in the two countries. In the 
opinion of Amorim, the Brazilian judicial branch is the only 
institution without indications of corruption.

<F P=106> [Article by Ana Maria Tahan] </F>
  [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso of the 
PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] appears as the third 
most favored candidate for the presidency of the Republic, 
behind Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers Party [PT] and 
possible PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] candidate Mayor Paulo 
Maluf. Cardoso is followed by former Governor Orestes Quercia 
(PMDB) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], Bahia Governor 
Antonio Carlos Magalhaes (PFL) [Liberal Front Party], and Rio de 
Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola. The Gallup poll, conducted at 
O ESTADO's request in February -- and thus before the creation 
of the URV [real value unit] was announced -- which interviewed 
2,566 people in 21 states, reveals that Lula enjoys 30.9 percent 
of the electoral preference, Maluf 12.6 percent, and Fernando 
Henrique 10.3 percent. 
  Gallup interviewed electors from 220 municipal districts, 
and 
found out that Quercia is the fourth most favored candidate, 
with 7.4 percent of the electoral preference, Magalhaes fifth 
with 6.9 percent, while Brizola obtained 5.9 percent of the 
votes, if the first round of elections were to be held between 1 
and 18 February, which is when the poll was conducted. Gallup 
Director Carlos Matheus commented that "the probe was carried 
out before the economic plan was announced, and therefore before 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso received repeated media exposure." 
  The figures reveal that Lula is the favorite candidate for 
all social classes, all age groups, and for electors of various 
educational levels. But Cardoso closely follows Lula in the 
electoral preference of class A electors with 25.4 percent of 
the electoral preference, while Lula has 28.3 percent. He also 
follows his possible adversary closely in the choice of electors 
with higher educational levels, who give Cardoso 25.3 percent of 
the votes and Lula 30.2 percent. As is the case for the PT 
candidate, Maluf supporters are also evenly divided between 
social classes, age groups, and educational levels. 
  Out of the 21 polled states, the PT candidate enjoys most 
support in the northwestern region, where he would obtain 36 
percent of the votes, and less in the south and the 
north-center-eastern region, with 28 percent. Maluf has more 
support in the south (15 percent) and less in the northeastern 
region (7 percent). Cardoso enjoys most support in the 
southwestern region, with 14 percent, and less in the south with 
5 percent, which is where Leonel Brizola -- who was born in 
Porto Alegre 0nd was former governor of this state -- has his 
best performance with 13 percent of the votes. Magalhaes enjoys 
most support in the northwest (23 percent) and less support in 
the south and the north-center-eastern region (2 percent). 
Quercia enjoys 9 percent of the northeastern votes and 7 percent 
of the southwestern and southern region votes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tasso Jereissati, the president of the </F>
Brazilian Social Democracy Party -- PSDB -- by Leticia Lins, in 
Fortaleza; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Lins] Do you think Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso is comfortable after launching the 
stabilization plan? If the measures are successful he will be 
considered a hero; if they are boycotted by Congress, however, 
he cannot be held responsible for their failure. 
  [Jereissati] On the contrary, his position is very 
difficult. 
He is completely involved and very much imbued in the Economic 
Stabilization Plan. He is a man of great historical perception 
and understands that he is on the brink of the historic 
possibility of solidly solving the inflation problem. He gained 
credit before the country as the man capable of crafting the 
great commitment that has been needed for years, a commitment 
that is known in many ways; the national pact, conciliation, 
etc. Thus Cardoso's decision to stay or leave is not easy. 
  [Lins] Not long ago it was said that you, as president of 
the 
PSDB, would run as vice presidential candidate to PT [Workers 
Party] candidate Lula's [Luis Ignacio da Silva] presidential 
bid. Are the negotiations over? 
  [Jereissati] The PT has a social democratic group, which is 
currently one of the most interesting political factions in the 
country. This faction is not the majority in its party. This 
was demonstrated during the last internal elections for PT 
regional executive boards. Lula is hostage of the rest of the 
party. Furthermore, the PT and the PSDB have different 
platforms. Although we have some points in common with Lula, 
unfortunately he is disavowed by his own party. 
  [Lins] Are there no more negotiations with the PT? 
  [Jereissati] The talks were hampered. Apart from the 
different platforms of our parties, we are unable to agree with 
the harsh criticisms by Lula of the Economic Stabilization Plan. 
Since our alliances are discussed around programs and 
objectives and not around names, our differences prevent a 
greater understanding. 
  [Lins] But Lula has demanded an alliance and accuses your 
party of being indecisive. Has the PSDB decided that it will 
not share a ticket with the PT? 
  [Jereissati] We are not indecisive. We are constant. We 
agree regarding a Parliamentarian government system, opening the 
economy, state reform, and privatization. The points that are 
constantly being changed are those upheld by the PT. 
  [Lins] Does this mean that the PSDB will run its own 
candidate? 
  [Jereissati] The party has already decided that. We are 
ready for the race, and it is currently very clear that the best 
candidate profile is a PSDB member. 
  [Lins] With the success of the Economic Stabilization Plan, 
will that PSDB candidate be Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso? 
  [Jereissati] If I said I would pull him out of his ministry 
I 
did not say so only as party president, but in face of a 
political fact. If there is one point on which everyone agrees 
in this country it is that the problem of Brazil is not economic 
but political. The political problem is the lack of a great 
national commitment in Brazil, capable of implementing a change. 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso did exactly that: he compromised 
several sectors of Brazilian society around a common objective, 
which is stabilization. Since the moment he attained that, and 
after proving his political competence, he earned the reputation 
of being the only man capable of negotiating this highly desired 
national commitment without making demagogic promises and 
without posing as a savior of the nation. He has his feet 
firmly on the ground, he does not pretend to be messianic, and 
offers realistic proposals. 
  [Lins] So the Economic Stabilization Plan has made him a 
stronger candidate? 
  [Jereissati] Society will clearly see the benefits and in 30 
days everyone will see that he who negotiated a great national 
commitment must not remain stuck in a smaller project on account 
of calendar deadlines: Not only can he, but he must, launch 
himself on a more important project. 
  [Lins] Like that, with what parties would you form 
alliances? 
  [Jereissati] We want alliances because we are clearly aware 
of the size of our party. There could be an impasse if we win 
the elections but we lack majority in Congress. This is why we 
must agree upon a government program to guarantee governability 
and to finish with the endless exchange of favors and political 
patronage to get executive branch initiatives approved in 
Congress. 
  [Lins] Then, with which parties will you talk? With the 
PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], the PFL [Liberal 
Front Party], or with some PT sectors? 
  [Jereissati] The coalition we dream of is with the PFL and 
the PMDB. It may seem strange but that is happening in the rest 
of the world. Without seeming presumptuous, the world is 
becoming social democratic. First we will establish the name of 
our candidate and then we will begin talks. We began talks with 
the PT. But now we must concentrate the best of our party with 
the best of the PFL and the PMDB. We can unite our ideas around 
a government program, we are open to support. 
  [Lins] What did you think of the Bahia PSDB note criticizing 
an attempt to establish an alliance with the PFL? 
  [Jereissati] Any alliance suffers regional resistance and 
this is exactly what is happening with Bahia. We do not fear 
the idea of distorting our convictions because of the 
candidates. We have a tradition of opposing when it was 
necessary but ours has always been a coherent opposition based 
on high principles. One can no longer engage in politics 
pressured by ideological commitments. I do not fear the 
calling-in of favors because I never occupied 
government-designated posts and have participated in the great 
movements such as the movement for direct elections. 
  [Lins] On the subject of an alliance with the PFL, Deputy 
Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes is mentioned as a vice presidential 
candidate in a ticket headed by the PSDB... 
  [Jereissati] He is a good candidate, but there has been 
nothing definite yet. There has been no talks regarding names. 
I can tell you that the PFL is supporting us in Congress 
regarding the Economic Stabilization Plan. 
  [Lins] Do these discussions jeopardize the constitutional 
reform process? 
  [Jereissati] Quite the contrary. The electoral atmosphere 
jeopardizes it far more. The plan seeks to speed up the reform, 
it pushes the reform forward. [passage omitted] 
  [Lins] Are you candidate for the Ceara State governorship, 
for the Senate, or will you run as the possible replacement for 
the finance minister? 
  [Jereissati] I intend to run for a seat in the Senate. For 
the moment I do not plan to return to the Ceara government but I 
have not fully ruled out this possibility. As for aspiring to 
replace the finance minister, that is mere speculation by the 
media. No one has asked me about this subject. 
  [Lins] Are you in favor of the reelection of governors? 
  [Jereissati] I have my doubts. It is not good to hold a post 
for long because power is nasty and tends to ruin people. On 
the other hand, three or four years are not long enough for 
someone who has a serious government program to implement. 
  [Lins] Were you surprised by the Northeastern politicians' 
veto on the name of Senator Beni Varas for the Regional 
Integration Ministry? 
  [Jereissati] It is regrettable that we are still influenced 
by political patronage, by petty and retrograde politics of 
certain Northeastern leaderships interested in maintaining that 
region in its current situation. That mentality not only exists 
in the Northeastern region, it exists throughout the country. 
Brazil needs statists, not men with limited and electoral 
objectives. This is why I believe our economic growth can take 
a huge and qualitative step forward with Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso. Individualism belongs to the past. We will work for 
the community and promote the State reform Brazil needs.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- Hitoshi Tanabe, 32, one of the most 
wanted members of the Japanese mafia (Yakuza), was arrested on 7 
March on a warrant issued by the Brazilian Supreme Court at the 
request of the Japanese Government. Tanabe is the leader of 
Dinshoukai, a faction of Yamaguchi-gumi, one of the main mafia 
organizations in Japan. The Federal Police [PF] arrested him in 
Londrina, Parana State. 
  Police officer Itanor Neves Carneiro said: There are strong 
indications that there are other Yakuza members in the country. 
  The PF suspect that Tanabe came to Brazil to run an 
international drug trafficking ring and to send Brazilian women 
to Japan to work as prostitutes. The extradition request was 
based on the seizure of 5.8 kg of cocaine in the Japanese city 
of Shizuoka in February 1993. It was the fifth largest seizure 
of cocaine in Japan, an amount worth $4 million in Japan and 
$90,000 in Brazil. At that time trafficker Takahiro Shiba 
confessed to the Japanese police that the cocaine had come from 
Brazil, and that it belonged to Tanabe. 
  Like most Yakuza members, Tanabe has tattoos on his body 
from 
his chest down to his ankles. Upon his transfer to Sao Paulo, 
Tanabe confirmed that he is a ranking member of Yamaguchi-gumi, 
but declined to give details. Nor did he want to explain why 
one digit of the little finger on his left hand had been severed. 
  Tanabe has a daughter born in Brazil -- Mary, 10 months old 
-- and was living with her and his Japanese wife, Kiyomi, in 
Brazil.

<F P=106> [Article by Claudia de Souza] </F>
  [Text] The Brazilian Government on 6 March sent its 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South] partners a "non-paper" 
presenting its project to create a Latin American Free Trade 
Zone (ALCSA). 
  Through this document, which is normally used when one is in 
the middle of negotiations or to discuss political subjects, 
Brazil is already consulting Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay 
about their disposition to extend the trade liberation system to 
other countries in the region like the Andean Pact (Venezuela, 
Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia) or individual partners 
like Chile. This suggestion will be discussed on 9 March during 
a Mercosur meeting in Buenos Aires. 
  Ever since it was launched last October and presented as a 
proposal during the Aladi [Latin American Integration 
Association] meeting in February, the proposal has been 
discussed openly (and apparently well received) by the 
governments of Colombia and Venezuela. The argument for the 
proposal is that Mercosur must be open and not exclude anyone 
and that, if discussed within a legal framework similar to the 
European Common Market, the solution of commercial issues among 
South American countries will allow a rapid increase in trade. 
  The Brazilian Government's proposal is to create a free 
trade 
zone that will be ruled by the principle of promoting the 
liberalization of "substantially all trade" [preceding three 
words in English], an expression used by GATT: It includes all 
products in general, excluding only those regarded as sensitive 
by two parties. The Brazilian proposal covers an estimated 80 
percent of goods and services. 
  According to the explanation Brazilian Foreign Minister 
Celso 
Amorim gave those attending the ALADI meeting, ALCSA's objective 
would be to rapidly free trade between the region's countries in 
a period of not more than 10 years, between 1995 and 2005. 
"According to the Brazilian proposal, the ALCSA agreements 
would basically consist of programs for direct, automatic, and 
progressive tax reductions and cover substantive trade areas. 
In our opinion, tax reductions must necessarily take place in 
differentiated deadlines and paces that must be in keeping with 
the degree of economic development. We also believe free trade 
talks should be focused on merchandise and the tariff and 
non-tariff fields," Amorim said then, adding that negotiations 
would thus become more agile and the accords would be approved 
in order to allow the liberalization of trade starting in 
January 1995. 
  Brazil, for example, could negotiate specific agreements 
alone where its Mercosur partners do not have direct interests. 
  The Brazilian Government believes its proposal will be 
accepted because it simply extends to other partners a practice 
used constantly during the GATT Uruguay Round negotiations, 
where Brazil upheld the principle of accepting or rejecting 
proposals by other countries only after consulting its Mercosur 
partners. 
  The proposal also aims at repeating, with other countries 
and 
groups in the region, the Mercosur "miracle" that allowed the 
country to increase by three-fold its exports to the region 
between 1990 and 1993. Itamaraty believes the key to Mercosur's 
success lies in the decision to give up discussing the tariff 
issue product by product for a broader direct tariff reduction. 
What remains to be done now is to broaden the area of action 
and reap the benefits. 
  At dawn on 6 March, during the program "Critica &amp; 
Autocritica" ["Criticism and Self-Criticism"] (produced by 
GAZETA MERCANTIL and aired by Television Bandeirantes), Foreign 
Minister Celso Amorim said: "South America is the priority 
issue of Brazil's foreign policy." If South America had a 
geopolitical importance in the past, according to the foreign 
minister, it now also has an economic importance: Brazilian 
trade with the region (including Mexico) already represents 25 
percent of its total trade, which is equivalent to the trade 
with the entire European Union and more than the 20 percent 
trade with the United States and 16 percent with the Asian and 
Pacific countries. 
  Brazil, unlike Argentina, does not intend to reveal any 
intention to join NAFTA, the free trade agreement between the 
United States, Canada, and Mexico. Last week Argentine 
President Carlos Menem announced that in June he will begin 
negotiations in this direction. During the "Critica &amp; 
Autocritica" program, Foreign Minister Amorim clearly stated 
that the Brazilian Government regards the Argentine Government's 
initiative as a political initiative. Technically, he 
explained, any negotiation for a Mercosur member to join NAFTA 
should be carried out by the four Mercosur member countries, 
according to the "Four Plus One" principle. 
  The foreign minister again insisted that there is no 
disagreement with Argentina. Even the recent increase of 
Argentine military expenditures with the purchase of weapons 
(particularly the Skyhawk aircraft from the United States) -- 
which according to Argentina is to replace old equipment -- did 
not cause any concern. Amorim commented that "if rivalry did 
exist we would have not reached a nuclear agreement," referring 
to the four-party, all-encompassing nuclear safeguard agreement 
between Brazil, Argentina, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for 
Accounting and Control (ABACC), and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, an agreement for mutual control signed in 1991 in 
Vienna and approved in early February by the Brazilian Senate. 
  This same agreement, which sets the ground for a better 
relationship with Argentina as well as Germany, may have played 
an important role, according to Celso Amorim, in solving 
problems on another front, bilateral relations with the United 
States. 
  Expressions of greater confidence in the country, such as 
that by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who last week 
suspended U.S. investigations regarding Brazil under the 
so-called Super 301 law after acknowledging the Brazilian 
commitment to approve its intellectual property protection draft 
bill, represent a more broad-minded tendency, the foreign 
minister believes. 
  "The United States wants the Brazilian economy to be 
successful. It is the largest Latin America country, with which 
the United States has the greatest trade volume after Mexico, 
and where U.S. exports have increased significantly," Amorim 
commented. 
  The fact that Brazil is trying to stabilize its economy also 
had its impact on this change of attitude by the United States, 
which gave signs that commercials sanctions would be applied 
until a few days before the final decision. The minister said: 
"The effort to stabilize the Brazilian economy was decisive."

<F P=106> [Article by Marta Salomon and Vanda Celia] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- According to a restricted access 
document that is circulating in Congress, the proposal for the 
new Economic Order -- which was drawn up by the rapporteur for 
the constitutional revision -- provides for an end to all the 
Union's monopolies and an end to the market reserve for 
state-run telecommunications and mail companies. The proposal 
is being negotiated by rapporteur Nelson Jobim, PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party] lawmaker for Rio Grande do Sul, who 
opted for a more flexible system, to be adopted by the next 
president of the Republic. 
  The decision to make more flexible the state presence in the 
economy is a majority trend within the Constituent Congress, 
which will be voting within a couple of weeks on the most 
controversial part of the reform. According to the rapporteur's 
report, which was released to a limited number of lawmakers, the 
concept of national capital enterprise and the restrictions on 
foreign capital will both disappear. Most of the activities 
that are currently being undertaken by monopolies, or that are 
being protected by market restrictions, will be exploited 
"directly by the Union, or through concession or authorization." 
  Jobim believes that his proposal could be good either for a 
president with a liberal program of government, or for a 
president whose program of government advocates strong 
participation by the state. The idea is not to produced a 
"fixed" economic model, because after the reform any change will 
require the support of three fifths of the congressmen. Despite 
the fact that it preserves the Union's power to control 
strategic sectors, the proposal does not prevent the 
participation of private enterprises in providing telephone and 
data-transmission services, for example. 
  Article 177 of the Constitution, which defines state 
monopolies, will undergo a deep change in the rapporteur's 
proposal. Not even the prospecting for, production, and 
enrichment of nuclear minerals will remain under a monopoly. 
Exploitation will be done directly by the Union or by 
authorized enterprises. 
  The Union will also control the prospecting for and 
exploitation of petroleum, but will not participate in the 
refining, importation, exportation, and maritime transportation 
of petroleum, which are considered the most profitable fields. 
This is the most controversial point of the proposal: 
exploitation of these areas will be free, and the only 
constitutional requirement will be to observe technical refining 
regulations and customs policies in the case of exportation and 
importation of oil and oil byproducts. 
  The proposal by the rapporteur puts an end to the provision, 
included in the 1988 Constitution, which makes a difference 
between Brazilian enterprises and national capital enterprises. 
Such enterprises will, however, enjoy preferential treatment: 
in addition to general benefits in the economy, they will have 
exclusive rights to produce minerals, and will enjoy preference 
for the purchase of goods and services by the state. Jobim's 
proposal ends the privileges and the restrictions affecting 
foreign capital in financial and health care institutions. The 
proposal maintains a preferential treatment for small-sized 
Brazilian enterprises. 
  In addition to ending the market reserve for enterprises 
like 
the Postal and Telegraph Company (ECT) for mail services, and 
Embratel [Brazilian Telecommunications Company] in the area of 
telecommunications, the modifications of the Economic Order will 
also affect other sectors. Among these are the exclusive market 
for Brazilian ship owners, commanders, and crew members for 
long-range navigation, and for navigation along the coast and 
along local routes, plus the restrictions on ships built outside 
Brazil. 
<H5>  The Proposal </H5>
  The following are the changes proposed by rapporteur Nelson 
Jobim for the Economic Order: 
  -- The prospecting for and production of petroleum, 
natural gas, and other fluid hydrocarbons will no longer be a 
monopoly, and will be directly exploited by the Union or by 
private enterprises through concessions granted in bidding. 
  -- The refining of Brazilian or foreign petroleum, the 
importation or exportation of byproducts, and the maritime 
transportation of petroleum in bulk will be open to exploitation. 
  -- The transportation of gas or petroleum through pipes 
can be directly exploited by the Union or through concession. 
The same conditions will apply to the prospecting for, 
production of, and enrichment of nuclear minerals. 
  -- The postal service and public telecommunications 
services can be exploited by the private sector with 
authorization or concession from the Union, which will lose 
control over the National Air Mail Service. 
  -- The Union will no longer directly exploit the 
infrastructure of airports, or the highway, railway, and river 
transportation infrastructure for transportation between 
national ports and within the national territory. Private 
enterprises will need authorization to operate in these fields. 
  -- The concept of national capital enterprise, and its 
benefits, will be terminated. Restrictions on foreign capital 
in the financial and health assistance fields will be terminated.

  [Excerpt] The introduction of a new currency, the real, 
which is scheduled for mid-April, should cause heavy losses to 
the financial system because of its curbing effect on inflation. 
A study conducted by a large retail loans bank indicates that 
losses to the financial system could reach $10.4 billion. It is 
estimated that the new currency might reduce the monthly 
inflation rate to about 2 percent by May. 
  This upheaval will force the financial institutions to gain 
money with new products, adjust their fees to higher rates, and 
indirectly streamline their structures. Its impact should be 
similar to that caused by the Cruzado Program in 1986, although 
the financial system has already had to go through extensive 
belt-tightening since then. 
  Arnoldo de Oliveira, the National Bank executive board 
superintendent, emphasizes: "It will be a painful process 
because it will end with a dishonest system. And after this the 
system's profitability will decline." 
  By a dishonest system we understand the following: The bank 
overlooks the huge profits yielded by floating funds -- the 
unused money that remains in the current accounts. And the 
customer, in turn, pretends that the bank does not have any 
operational costs. Out of a total $18 billion in profits, this 
sector gained $4 billion through the use of floating funds.

  [Text] The countries of the Common Market of the South 
(Mercosur) will be interconnected by a fiber optics network as 
of September, according to the estimates of the C&amp;M joint 
venture gathering 25 telephone enterprises from several 
countries, which is investing $75 million to allow Brazil, 
Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay to gain access to multimedia 
systems. Christened Unisul, the fiber optics cable will join 
Florianopolis (Santa Catarina) and Montevideo, while two other 
cables will make connections with Asuncion and Buenos Aires. 
The expansion of the network to Santiago has also been provided 
for. There will be a total of 1,720 km of underwater cables 
along the South American Atlantic coast. 
  Unisul will allow regional telecommunications enterprises to 
send images, data, and voice, both separately and 
simultaneously. This infrastructure will in the near future 
allow South American users of interactive systems to have access 
to or to transmit from their homes communications services and 
entertainment, cultural, or general information for public use. 
  The Unisul system will join the Brazilian fiber optics 
network as far as Fortaleza (Ceara). From this city it will 
connect South America with the cable systems of North America 
and Europe. The Brazilian part of the project should be 
finished in 1995, but there could be a delay. For Europe and 
North America, the estimate is that operation will begin in 
1994. To communicate with Argentina, Brazil will have 15,120 
channels. During a first stage, however, only 2,500 channels 
will be opened. This figure, however, is enough to expand by 
five times the current communications capacity between the two 
main South American countries. In the opinion of Embratel 
[Brazilian Telecommunications Company], the cables will serve to 
relieve the congestion of telephone traffic to Argentina. 
<H5>  Brazilian Network </H5>
  The Brazilian fiber optics network provides for a first 
stage 
of 7,500 km. The first stretch will join Rio de Janeiro and Sao 
Paulo. The following lines will join southern Brazil and Belo 
Horizonte (Minas Gerais) and the northeastern region. 
  According to Embratel reports, Brazilian fiber optics 
projects include short and long distance systems that will 
connect the main capitals of the country. According to Telesp 
[Sao Paulo Telecommunications, Inc.] information, 90,000 meters 
of cable are being installed per month. By the year 2000 it is 
estimated that 70 percent of the Sao Paulo metropolitan region 
will be served by fiber optics cables. 
<H5>  Educational Telecommunication Network </H5>
  Embratel and the Ministries of Education and Science and 
Technology have begun to work on Brazil's information 
superhighway. It is a system that will expand the National 
Research Network interconnecting Brazilian universities, which 
will also connect schools and cultural organizations such as 
libraries and museums. There will be three cultural networks 
that will be freely accessible in the future.

  [Text] Cochabamba, 24 Feb -- President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada, commenting on the "rapprochement" with Chile, stated 
here today that "diplomatic relations are not resumed based on 
conditions; conditions are not established for this." 
  He added: "It is when one sees that the Chilean people, the 
Bolivian people, have experienced a true change in mentality 
that there is true acceptance, that there is hope for 
negotiations. Many people in Bolivia maintain that we must not 
resume relations until we establish conditions, but this leads 
nowhere. What one has to see is the moment in which the Chilean 
people, the Bolivian people, are willing to start true talks, 
negotiations, and thus work toward a first meeting." 
  Sanchez de Lozada said that "things are changing rapidly," 
as 
are the countries, and therefore this is "a subject that 
requires, as I have stated before, audacity and prudence." 
  The chief of state insisted that the subject must be handled 
"seriously" because "domestic policy is one thing, and 
international policy another." "There was a feeling that if I 
attended this presidential inauguration [Chilean President-elect 
Eduardo Frei's inauguration on 11 March] it would be a sort of 
acknowledgement, a tacit resumption of diplomatic relations. I 
think there are chances that this will happen at some point, but 
I still do not have a deadline nor a date set for restoring 
relations. We will see what happens with time, but we thought 
this was not the appropriate moment. But neither was it a 
matter of turning the invitation down, so we thought the best 
solution would be to send someone close to me who at the same 
time did not belong to the government, and I think we have come 
up with an imaginative solution." 
  However, consulted about the significance to Bolivia of the 
landlocked subject, he said: "Well, the sea problem has existed 
for more than 100 years, and we are not going to solve it with 
my wife's visit, but it represents a rapprochement. It is very 
hard to hold a dialogue with someone with whom you have no 
relations. You must talk to reach an understanding. We believe 
this was the adequate solution, and a step forward." 
  Sanchez de Lozada referred to the invitation extended to him 
by Chilean President Patricio Aylwin, which he termed 
"important." The president ended by stating: "This is how one 
starts a rapprochement, trying to find the right moment for this 
rapprochement process so it can result in something concrete and 
to the benefit of the Bolivian people."

  [Text] The government has authorized the replacement of its 
Hawker Hunter planes by Mirage-5 fighters from the Belgian Air 
Force. This was reported by Chilean Air Force [FACh] Commander 
General Ramon Vega, who said that the FACh had long been 
interested in purchasing the Mirages from Belgium. He said that 
a special delegation will travel to Belgium to analyze the 
operation and the technical characteristics of the airplanes, to 
observe their compatibility with those already owned by the FACh. 
  [Begin Vega recording] This is an old aspiration of the 
FACh. 
We have 45 Hawker Hunter airplanes, which represents a 
considerable figure in our force. Due to their deterioration 
they must be withdrawn from service this year without fail. 
These 20 new airplanes will compensate for the loss of the 
Hawker Hunters. [end recording] 
  Gen. Vega also said that the decision to purchase the 
Mirages 
is the result of many studies carried out over the past few 
years, through which it was determined that the Mirages would 
replace the Hawker Hunters, which have been in operation since 
mid-1968. 
  He added that there are no preestablished terms for delivery 
of the airplanes. Delivery will take as long as is necessary, 
but not longer than a month [as heard], he said. As for the 
cost, Gen. Vega said this was a difficult subject, but it is 
within the ceiling established by law, a little more than $80 
million. He also said that the Belgian Government has granted 
Chile payment terms by which 70 percent of the funds will come 
from a government-to-government credit without charging interest. 
  Gen. Vega said that the FACh wants the contract to be signed 
by the middle of 1994 and the new airplanes to begin operating 
by the end of 1994.

<F P=106> [Interview with Socialist Party President Camilo Escalona by </F>
Raquel Correa; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] 
<H5>  Palestro's Return? </H5>
  His great personal drawing power was demonstrated during the 
last election. If he obtained 48,000 votes with the enthusiastic 
support of the left (today the MIDA [Allendist Leftist 
Democratic Movement]) in 1989, now he received 62,500. This 
fact, and that he heads the Socialist movement, has led many to 
conclude that "this business of socialist renewal" is just a 
fairy tale. The political scientist, trained while in exile at 
the University of Madrid, replies with a straight face: 
  "I believe it is due to my strong ties with my district." 
  [Correa] Is it not proof that the Socialist grass roots have 
not been renewed, as Hernan Larrain said? 
  [Escalona] No. These arguments are too esoteric for the man 
in the street, as Julio Martinez would say. There was a strong 
tendency to vote for the person. And without a doubt, I was the 
congressman in the Concertation who had the greatest following 
in the district. 
  [Correa] Would you like Mario Palestro to return to the PS 
[Socialist Party]? 
  [Escalona] Of course! He is a bit undisciplined but--he is a 
Socialist after all! What are we going to do: we cannot cover 
the sun with a finger. In reality, he has become disconnected 
from reality. 
  [Correa] He despises the "renewed ones." Do you, also? 
  [Escalona] I am very critical of renewed Socialists. But at 
the same time, I deeply value the effort and the intellectual 
contribution they are making to update Socialist thinking. 
  [Correa] What is your basic discrepancy with the "renewed 
ones?" 
  [Escalona] Especially a question of style: I find them 
artificial, without going to the extreme of Palestro, who says 
that they wear pink underwear. 
<H5>  Market Economy </H5>
  [Correa] With regard to Socialist thinking, do you accept 
the 
market economy? 
  [Escalona] It is a conception of the state that I value and 
accept. Because if a state is not democratic, even though it 
might call itself socialist, it represents a contradiction in 
principle with our political thought. In other words, a state 
that is administered under the concept of the dictatorship of 
the proletariat is incompatible with the basic principles of 
Socialist thought, which speak of pluralism, alternation in 
power, liberty and the rights of individuals. Now, in the field 
of economics, I believe that they are hastening to accept a 
model with aspects which today are in dispute.... Even President 
Aylwin spoke of a "cruel" system. In renewed socialism, this 
discussion is in process. We, who recognize that the economic 
process does not work without the market, can give this fact a 
progressive twist and, at the same time, the possibility to 
resolve the problems that the market does not resolve on its 
own: social inequalities. I believe that renewal socialism's 
hastiness in dealing with this theme produced a negative 
cultural effect: a certain legitimization of the concept of 
market economy as it was handed down by the military regime. 
  [Correa] Are you delegitimizing the market economy? 
  [Escalona] We accept that the market is indispensable for 
the 
functioning of the economy, but we want to make corrections in 
it that give efficacy to the productive process to enable it to 
resolve the social inequalities that the market is unable to 
resolve by itself. In 1992, after losing the internal elections, 
I published an article called The Socialist Plan for the Market, 
in which I argued that we Socialists could not remain paralyzed, 
as if barking at the moon, criticizing the market. That instead 
we ought to develop program proposals that emphasize the 
redistributive function. 
  [Correa] You do not believe in the social economics of the 
market either? 
  [Escalona] This concept began to be adopted when equitable 
growth was pursued, in this government, although we Socialists 
found it inadequate. When the 15 percent tax on the First 
Category was included, the social concept appears. 
  [Correa] Would you say that Foxley's policies followed that 
path? 
  [Escalona] I think they followed a progressive path, 
although 
that will seem an exaggeration to many leftists. There was 
progress, but inequalities did not disappear. 
  [Correa] What system do you think could make inequalities 
disappear in four years? 
  [Escalona] None. 
<H5>  Under Suspicion </H5>
  [Correa] How would you describe a socialist model today? 
  [Escalona] I believe that the way to be socialist is about 
to 
emerge. It does not exist yet. In President Aylwin's government, 
we had very important responsibilities and at the same time we 
maintained our presence and our responsibilities in the social 
movement, with a great many labor union leaders. But this 
situation does not exist today as a possibility. This is why the 
divorce between the Socialist grass roots and its leadership is 
so evident. 
  [Correa] If the next government were to be presided over by 
Ricardo Lagos instead of Frei, what specific difference would 
there have been? 
  [Escalona] We Socialists feel somewhat constrained from 
saying anything, because whatever we say is "under suspicion" in 
Chile because of the cultural climate. There are those who think 
that we want to establish a totalitarian state. The future 
minister of education said that education needs a revolution, 
and we Socialists agree with that, but if Lagos had said it 
there would have been an outcry. When I was a boy, social 
mobility was possible through education. Today, the same is not 
true, in general, which accentuates inequalities. A first 
essential question for the Socialists is that there is still no 
program of education for democracy, although there has been 
important progress. Second, a revolution is needed in the social 
security system: people--not only the elderly--are 
extraordinarily unprotected in Chile. We should be the principal 
factors in placing those two subjects on the agenda. 
  [Correa] Do you consider yourself a Marxist-Leninist? 
  [Escalona] No. Just Marxist. I reached the conclusion that 
the humanist content that we want to capture is not contained in 
that formulation. The word Leninism is associated with 
atrocities and genocide, which are contrary to what we aspire to. 
  [Correa] You lived in countries that were under real 
socialism. What did you feel when the wall fell? 
  [Escalona] A conception of the state collapsed. What was 
latent in my political thinking took form. I was familiar with 
several ex-socialist countries, and I was aware of the level of 
bureaucracy, the inefficiency, popular apathy, alienation from 
power, lack of participation. The destruction of the wall made 
absolutely clear that our concept of the state is completely 
different. 
  [Correa] What emphasis do you want to give socialism. Make 
it 
more leftist? 
  [Escalona] No. Humanize it. Because we are experiencing a 
conflict of realities. We come in from the street, from strikes, 
protests, and suddenly we find ourselves in the government. This 
is why we have a mixed party, so to speak, and, so that it may 
become one again, we must concentrate the activity of the party 
on persons. Because if today you compare the profile of a 
Socialist who is adviser to the minister of finance with a 
Socialist coal miner, you will find two very different points of 
view. We need to find common ground. 
  [Correa] By making the adviser more leftist and the miner 
more rightist? 
  [Escalona] Something like that. We can help greatly to 
improve health services, for example. People do not look 
favorably on health service personnel because the service is 
bad. We have to make an effort so that those workers do not 
abandon their legitimate union aspirations and at the same time 
understand that they are part of a people who must be well 
served.... Our new concept is "a party for the people." 
  [Correa] And what is it now? 
  [Escalona] A party for power. 
  [Correa] As president of the PS, why did you not support 
Isabel Allende? 
  [Escalona] Because the veto against me was still in effect. 
Last week's Plenum created a new situation in the party: that 
any agreement is possible. Before the Plenum, any agreement was 
possible, except that I could become president of the party. In 
any case, I never objected to her. 
  [Correa] Would you have preferred to vote for the priest 
Pizarro than for Frei? 
  [Escalona] No. The integralism of Pizarro's line spared me 
any problems of conscience. What a conservative! I doubt that 
any Communist could say that Pizarro is more progressive than 
Frei.... I believe that Frei is a lucky man: it is his fate to 
live during a period that might see the democratic reformulation 
of the country. I believe that, over the long term, political 
realities will influence the position of the right. As 1997 
approaches, there will be movement toward agreement on 
institutional matters, although not completely to the 
satisfaction of the Concertation. 
  [Correa] How do you feel about the appointment of German 
Correa as chief of the Cabinet? 
  [Escalona] It is a daring step for the president-elect. 
  [Correa] Why did the PS oppose the appointment at first? 
  [Escalona] Only because German's departure could have caused 
a problem of governability in the party. 
  [Correa] Do you consider it a master stroke, to bind the 
Socialists to the Concertation? 
  [Escalona] It is something we cannot ignore. The separation 
of the presidential and the congressional elections must have 
made the Christian Democrats think that we had to be more 
cautious with positions of so much responsibility. But the 
important thing is that this shows the extent to which we have 
internalized the Concertation. 
  [Correa] Foxley said that he will be loyal to Frei until the 
last day of his administration. Would you say the same? 
  [Escalona] We will be part of the Frei government for his 
entire administration. 
  [Correa] What could make you leave? 
  [Escalona] Changes in the situation so radical that I cannot 
imagine them at the moment. 
  [Correa] Is the relationship of the left with the government 
strong now? 
  [Escalona] More intense. 
  [Correa] Do you think that the Ministry of Public Works is 
sufficient for Lagos? 
  [Escalona] The Foreign Ministry would have been better. 
<H5>  PS-PPD: Realization? </H5>
  [Correa] Do you favor the convergence of the PS-PPD [Party 
for Democracy]? 
  [Escalona] No, because it irritates and exacerbates 
relations 
between the two parties. 
  [Correa] But Lagos is in favor.... 
  [Escaalona] Yes, but when he came to call on us he said that 
he understands that this is not possible at the moment; what he 
wants is coordination that optimizes the bilateral relationship. 
  [Correa] What do you think of the statements by Deputy 
Shaulsohn that the PPD should exercise hegemony in the 
Concertation? 
  [Escalona] I cannot believe he said that. The idea of 
hegemony is so aggressive.... 
  [Correa] He also said that "a great progressive force," 
PPD-PS, "was an abstract realization [entelequia]." 
  [Escalona] I understand that because of origin, shared 
experiences, even Lagos's leadership, there is an aspiration for 
a force to exist between the PS and the PPD that would play a 
progressive role in the Concertation. 
  [Correa] How do you intend to manage things between the 
various factions of the PS, considering that your faction 
represents less than half of the party? 
  [Escalona] I hope that the agreement that was reached last 
week will become a substantive political agreement with all the 
factions. I am not going to try to reach an understanding with 
one faction to the detriment of another. 
  [Correa] Are you going to be "above factions?" 
  [Escalona] I am going to be multilateral. 
<H5>  Order and Repression </H5>
  [Correa] What will you do on the day that a Socialist 
minister, under the obligation to maintain public order, has to 
permit repression? 
  [Escalona] Bernardo Leighton was minister of interior and 
went down in history as one of the great democrats. The Ministry 
of Interior in a democratic government does everything it can to 
avoid excesses of repression. In everything that signifies 
maintaining public order with the legitimate means of democratic 
governability of the country, the minister of interior has the 
unrestricted support of the Socialist Party. 
  [Correa] But if a mishap occurs during a confrontation...? 
  [Escalona] What may happen because of a "mishap" is not the 
political responsibility of the minister of interior. 
  [Correa] Does this total commitment of the PS to the 
Concertation impede the formation of a leftist alliance with the 
Communist Party? 
  [Escalona] We are not working to recreate a leftist 
alliance. 
We are not thinking about a Socialist-Communist alliance. It is 
impossible: we have a different understanding of the country. We 
think that the Concertation is a constructive, progressive, 
stabilizing factor in Chilean society, and the Communist Party 
sees it as a continuation of Pinochet. There is no meeting point. 
  [Correa] Do you feel closer today to the PDC [Christian 
Democratic Party], which was Allende's adversary, than to the PC 
[Communist Party], which was his ally? 
  [Escalona] Of course. As a deputy for a working class 
district, I am at peace with my conscience participating in a 
government that has built 90,000 housing units during the year 
and not forming part of an opposition that contributes nothing. 
In any case, it is a matter of principle for me that we 
Socialists cannot form part of a McCarthyite philosophy that 
tends to demonize the Communists, a view which can lead to any 
extreme.

  [Text] Santiago. Anselmo Sule was designated president of 
the Radical Party (PR) to deal with the crisis created by the 
results of the latest intraparty elections and to prepare for 
internal elections called for 30 May. The solution was reached 
after lengthy and tense negotiations with the sector led by 
Ricardo Navarrete and Enrique Silva Cimma, with the group 
obtaining a vice presidency and strong representation on the 
Governing Board. 
  In the tumultuous Council meeting, held in the Diego 
Portales 
building, only the regional councillors, members of Congress, 
and the Governing Board took part. Mid-level PR officials and 
rank and file militants were not included, in accordance with 
the bylaws. 
  This caused severe criticism from the Radical rank and file, 
who gathered outside the building with signs. The leadership 
summoned the Carabineros to disperse the demonstrators and 
encourage them to make an orderly entry into the building. 
  The final agreement on the Governing Board was reached after 
1930, following complex negotiations in which Navarrete's group 
conditioned its support on obtaining an important position, such 
as the General Secretariat or a vice presidency, and a 
significant presence in the directive bodies. 
  The outcome was that the faction led by Navarrete and Silva 
Cimma will fill six of the 14 seats on the Emergency Board, 
while the group led by the current president of the PR, Carlos 
Gonzalez Marquez, and Sule, will hold the remaining eight. 
  The Governing Board was constituted as follows: president, 
Anselmo Sule; vice presidents, with equal authority, Ricardo 
Navarrete and Sergio Carrasco; secretary general, Ernesto 
Velasco, one of the party's new faces; secretary of organization 
and control, Aldo Bruzzone; and the national directors: Mireya 
Alfaro, Gaspar Bernales, Jaime Campos, Jorge Millan, Moises 
Signorelli, Wilson Tapia, Milton Vergara, Mario Weitzel and a 
fourteenth director to be designated tomorrow. 
  The Political Committee will be made up of Alex Acosta, 
Mario 
Cabezas, Patricio Tombolini, Sergio Villegas, and members of 
Congress Mario Devau, Dionisio Faulbann and Jose Pena. 
  Outgoing President Carlos Gonzalez Marquez congratulated the 
councillors for the manner in which they conducted the difficult 
negotiations. "This agreement was proposed basically by the 
leadership of the party's rank and file, the regional 
councillors. We want the rank and file to regain sovereignty and 
this is why we are going to have an election on 30 May, so that 
the rank and file can elect its new national officers.... There 
has been a profound, frank, serious, and painful examination, 
but it was worthwhile doing." 
  The new president, Anselmo Sule--the only Radical senator 
who 
will retain his Senate seat after March--announced that the new 
Governing Board's work program and the Council's final accords 
will be made known next Tuesday, 11 January. He expressed 
appreciation for the support and concern of militants, "at such 
an important moment, when the Radical Party is passing through a 
serious crisis. We expect to come out of it strong, with great 
vigor, and we hope that in the next national election we will 
again become, in number of votes and elective offices, one of 
the country's principal forces."

<F P=106> [Article by Alejandra Costamagna] </F>
  [Text] When all the negotiating juggling tricks seemed 
exhausted, patience took a back seat to reason and the 
longed-for statement was spoken by Finance Minister Alejandro 
Foxley: "There is agreement on the subordinated debt." 
  After several days of adroit maneuvering, the principal 
negotiators met yesterday, 14 January, on the subject that had 
delayed the approval of the project to modernize banks and to 
propose a new solution to the problem of the subordinated debt. 
  Sebastian Pinera, Jaime Orpis, Andres Zaldivar, Jaime 
Gazmuri, Jaime Estevez, Jose Florencio Guzman (superintendent of 
banks and financial institutions), Patricio Arrau (advisor to 
the Ministry of Finance), Jorge Marshall (vice president of the 
Central Bank), Camilo Carrasco (director of financial policy at 
the Central Bank) and Minister Foxley took six hours to work out 
the final details of the accord. 
  The document establishes a minimum term of 40 years and a 
schedule of payments on the subordinated debt ($3.8 billion) 
that 10 banks have pending with the Central Bank since the 
financial crisis of 1982. The institutions concerned must make 
their annual payments with the percentage of their surpluses 
which currently are due to the Central Bank and, if this is 
insufficient, they must make payment through increases in their 
capital or with bonds convertible into shares. 
  The most controversial subject until yesterday had been the 
determination of the value of those bonds. While the government 
maintained that the value should be responsive to determination 
by the market, the opposition argued that the value should be a 
nominal figure. Foxley explained that the matter was resolved by 
establishing an average market price "plus a surcharge that 
would reflect their increased value anticipated at auction." 
Although this amount was not specified, it was estimated that it 
could vary between 10 and 15 percent, so that it would not 
represent a loss for the Central Bank. 
  The text made clear that preferred stockholders would have 
the first option to subscribe to these bonds convertible into 
shares. 
  Amid smiles that combined satisfaction with fatigue, the 
expectation for the vote on Tuesday, 18 January, is one of 
complete optimism, because the agreement rules out the awful 
possibility that the Concertation might vote against the idea of 
legislating, which would have meant the postponement of the 
matter for a year. 
  A decision regarding treatment of portfolio bills of sale 
[letra por venta de cartera] is still pending. But among 
congressmen there was agreement in their disagreement. Although 
this may seem paradoxical, it means that they will make every 
effort to reach agreement by Tuesday. If no agreement is 
reached, the matter will be resolved in the legislative process. 
"This is not going to be an obstacle to the proposal's 
approval," was stated more than once. 
  What remains to be done before Tuesday (which ceased to be 
"D-Day" to become a kind of confirmatory day) is the meeting 
that the protagonists will hold to ratify these agreements and 
formalize them in a document. 
<H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5>
<H5>  The Four Points of the Agreement </H5>
  The agreement that emerged after six hours of discussion in 
Minister Foxley's office can be summarized in four points: 
  1. Establish a minimum term and a schedule of payments on 
the 
subordinated debt so that the debt will no longer have an 
indefinite term. 
  2. Banks with subordinated debt must make their annual 
payments with the percentage of their surpluses that currently 
are due to the Central Bank. If this is insufficient, they must 
make payment through increases in their capital or with bonds 
convertible into shares, according to the circumstances. 
  3. The value of these bonds will be determined by the 
average 
market price, plus a surcharge that reflects their increased 
value anticipated at auction. 
  4. Preferred stockholders will always have the first option 
to subscribe to these bonds convertible into shares. 
<H5>  Pending </H5>
  * A decision regarding the treatment of portfolio bills of 
sale is still pending. If agreement is not reached, the matter 
will be resolved in the legislative process.

  [Text] Lima, 8 Mar (EFE) -- Military sources officially 
reported in Lima on 8 March that over the last eight days a 
total of 152 natives from the Peruvian Ashaninka ethnic group 
have managed to escape from the control of the terrorist group 
Shining Path, which had been holding them captive in the 
tropical forest area of Junin Department. 
  According to an official communique released today by the 
Ucayali Front Political Military Command, a group of 119 
Ashaninkas arrived at a countersubversive base of the Peruvian 
Navy located in Poyeni, Satipo Province, after fleeing from the 
grip of the terrorist group that had abducted them. 
  The communique states that the group was made up of 60 
children, 30 women, and 29 men. 
  On 6 March Army patrols rescued 25 Ashaninkas, who had been 
virtually reduced to slavery by Shining Path, in Shanquireni, 
another village in the tropical forest area of Junin Department. 
  A communique from the Political Military Command of the 
Central National Security Subregion states that this group was 
composed of 13 children, five women, and seven men. 
  Another military source reported that another eight 
Ashaninkas were released in Gloriabamba, located in the same 
jurisdiction. 
  All the communiques noted that the Ashaninkas were ill, 
suffered from severe malnutrition, and had been psychologically 
affected. 
  Ashaninkas have been held captive in several areas of Peru's 
central tropical forest by Shining Path, who used them as 
activists under threat of death and as their servants for 
household chores and agricultural activities under a system of 
virtual slavery. 
  Security forces have managed to release a considerable 
number 
of captives over the last few years, but there are still areas 
where the Maoist group holds them in captivity.

<F P=106> [DESCO Special Report No 32: "Political Violence in Peru </F>
Today," issued by Peru's Center for Development Studies and 
Promotion (DESCO)] 
  [Text] During the month of December, political violence 
generated 58 subversive attacks causing the deaths of 34 
persons. The attacks increased by 22 in comparison with the 
November figure but, fortunately, the death toll declined by 
eight. Of the total victims, 16 belonged to the civilian sector, 
12 were presumed subversives, four were members of the Police 
Forces [FFPP], and two were from the Armed Forces [FFAA]. 
  December was marked by two commemorative dates, which were 
the occasions of heightened Shining Path [SL] activity. The 
first was another birthday of Abimael Guzman, followed by the 
SL's promised celebration of the centennial of Mao Tse-tung's 
birth. They occurred at the beginning and end of the month, 
respectively. 
  Lima again ranked first insofar as attacks were concerned. A 
total of 37 acts of political violence (64 percent) were 
committed in the capital: that is, 17 more acts than in the 
previous month. 
  A day before Abimael Guzman's birthday, the SL's caused a 
minor blackout in the capital and in other zones of the country, 
sabotaging part of the Mantaro interconnected system for this 
purpose. In conjunction with the blackout, the subversives 
detonated some explosives in at least three Lima districts. 
  Ranking second for attacks was the Northern regional 
committee, with 10 subversive acts (17 percent). The number of 
attacks rose by seven compared with the previous month's figure. 
Three of these acts involved confrontations between the forces 
of order and the subversive columns. Two of these clashes 
occurred in the Chavin region, and the third in Sanchez Carrion 
Province, in the La Libertad sierra region. 
  The Central regional committee ranked third, with five 
attacks (9 percent): the same number of acts of political 
violence as during November. Two of these incidents involved 
assaults upon vehicles on highways, another was a confrontation, 
the fourth was sabotage against high voltage towers, and the 
last, a selective assassination. 
  Fourth place for attacks was tied between the Jungle and 
Southern regions, each of which had two acts (3 percent). In the 
Jungle the attacks declined by six, and in the South they 
increased by two. 
  Last place for attacks was taken by the Principal region, 
with one subversive act involving sabotage against electric 
power facilities. 
  As for victims, the Lima regional committee also ranked 
first, with 17 persons killed (50 percent). Two of these deaths 
were selective assassinations of popular leaders: one, a member 
of the Huayacan patrols, and the other, a general secretary of a 
human settlement in Chorrillos. 
  However, the incident with the most bloodshed occurred 
during 
the attack on the Bank of the Nation branch in El Agustino, in 
which three policemen, five civilians, and one subversive were 
killed. 
  Ranking second for victims was the Northern regional 
committee, with eight (24 percent). Five of these deaths were 
Shining Path casualties in a confrontation with a police patrol 
in Mariscal Luzuriaga Province. In an invasion, the subversives 
assassinated a lieutenant governor as well. 
  The Central regional committee ranked third, with seven 
victims (20 percent). Six of these deaths occurred during a 
confrontation between an Army patrol and an MRTA [Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement] group in La Merced. Five subversives and 
one soldier were killed in the clash. 
  The Jungle region ranked last, with two deaths (6 percent). 
One of the incidents was the subversives' assassination of the 
wife of a municipal councilman from Amarilis, and the other was 
the death of a member of the police at the hands of an MRTA 
group.

<F P=106> [Report by Miriam Ortiz from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] According to intelligence reports, Medellin Cartel 
prisoners might be in contact with the Valle del Cauca cartels 
in a bid to unite. Some experts are asking why the prosecutor 
general was not given these intelligence reports before the 
communique was issued by the Higher Council of National Security 
and Defense. Here is a report by Miriam Ortiz: 
  [Begin Ortiz recording] The Security Council based its 
decision on intelligence reports to prohibit the transfer of 
some Medellin Cartel members to the maximum security section at 
the Itagui prison. According to authorities, Carlos Alzate 
Urquijo, a.k.a. Arete, is Roberto Escobar's successor. After 
the attempt on his life, Roberto Escobar, a.k.a. Osito, 
delegated to Arete all of the functions he inherited from his 
brother Pablo Escobar. Roberto Escobar did this because he felt 
that with Alzate's leadership qualities, his family ties, and 
the respect he commands among his cohorts, there was no one 
better than Alzate to recover lost ground, prevent front men 
from taking over their properties, and prevent the dominance of 
the Cali Cartel. 
  According to intelligence reports, Arete is followed in the 
hierarchy by Luis Carlos Aguilar Gallego, a.k.a. Mugre; Jose 
Fernando Posada, a.k.a. Jaime Eduardo; and Gustavo Adolfo Arrula 
[name as heard], a.k.a. Maxwell. 
  The intelligence reports add that there is proof of links 
between the Medellin Cartel and the guerrilla groups based in 
Antioquia Department, especially with the Urban Militias led by 
the ELN [Army of National Liberation]. According to a statement 
by Pipe Perez [not further identified], Alzate Urquijo was the 
direct contact between the cartel and guerrilla leaders. The 
state intelligence agencies also report that Otto [Ottoniel 
Gonzalez Franco] and Popeye [John Jairo Velasquez] have, for the 
time being, moved out of the organization's spotlight and now 
want to make peace with their enemies. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Ayala and Raul Gutierrez from the "24 </F>
Hours" newscast] 
  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff continues to 
live in the eye of the hurricane. A special Security Council 
session -- a session attended by the president as well as the 
government, justice, and defense ministers, among others -- 
decided not to authorize Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff's 
request to transfer Medellin Cartel prisoners to their native 
city. Here is a report by Alvaro Ayala: 
  [Begin recording] [Ayala] The prosecutor general today said 
he will not resign, adding that he will study the National 
Security Council decision to block the transfer to Itagui of 
members of the Medellin Cartel currently held at the La Picota 
and Modelo jails in Santa Fe de Bogota. 
  [De Greiff] The Prosecutor General's Office will study the 
decision with due respect to the Security Council's opinions and 
recommendations, and it will adopt appropriate measures in a 
timely manner. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Can the fact that Medellin Cartel 
prisoners will not be transferred to the jail in Itagui be seen 
as weakness on the part of the government? 
  [De Greiff] No, I cannot make any additional comments other 
than those I have just made. 
  [Reporter] The attorney of [Cali Cartel members] Gilberto 
Rodriguez and Julio Fabio Ordinola just said that they will 
surrender if you guarantee that they will be held at a Valle del 
Cauca Department jail. Can you guarantee such a thing? 
  [De Greiff] I will also have to study this. I cannot say any 
more. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [De Greiff] No, I cannot say anything else. 
  [Reporter] Just one more question. There is the impression 
that the executive branch is not heeding your orders. 
  [De Greiff] Let each person judge this for himself according 
to his conscience and heart. 
  [Reporter] If the Cali Cartel members surrender, will you 
continue to work for the process of submission to justice by 
drug traffickers? 
  [De Greiff] I obviously have to accept it because this is 
what is established by Colombian law. [end recording] 
  The following are details of the Security Council communique 
that refused to authorize the prosecutor general's request. The 
communique stated that the government clearly disagrees with 
Gustavo de Greiff and that it has information concerning the 
reunification of the Medellin Cartel. Here is a report by Raul 
Gutierrez: 
  [Begin recording] [Gutierrez] The Security and Defense 
Council issued a severe warning to the prosecutor general for 
insisting on the transfer of Carlos Alzate, a.k.a. Arete; Carlos 
Aguilar, a.k.a. Mugre; Gustavo Gutierrez, a.k.a. Maxwell; Jose 
Fernando Posada; and Jorge Pizano from La Picota jail in Santa 
Fe de Bogota to the jail in Itagui, near Medellin. After 
meeting under the leadership of President Gaviria, the council 
recommended that the transfer not be carried out. It also 
expressed its serious disagreement with De Greiff for having 
stated that the Medellin Cartel prisoners do not intend to 
resume their criminal activities. 
  [Government Minister Fabio Villegas] Information available 
to 
the Higher Council of National Security and Defense permits us 
to state that they [Medellin Cartel prisoners] not only have the 
means to reunify, but also that their intentions appear to be 
leaning toward reunifying their criminal organizations, even 
uniting with the Valle cartels with which they have had contacts 
within the past few days. 
  [Gutierrez] The council gave its full support to the justice 
minister and the director of the Penitentiary and Prison 
Institute, thereby enabling them to maintain the state of 
emergency in the prisons and keep organized crime chiefs 
dispersed in various prisons. 
  [Villegas] This was done because we believe the transfer 
would represent a grave danger to public order, prison security, 
the security of Medellin, and the nation's security, and it also 
would provide a means for the last remnants of the Medellin 
Cartel to reunify. 
  [Gutierrez] To prevent anything from being left out, the 
Higher Security and Defense Council recommended to the justice 
minister that he ask the prosecutor general to change the venue 
of the legal processes against the five members of the Medellin 
Cartel. [end recording]

  [Text] Two documents that were made public today, the 
prosecutor general's letter to the U.S. attorney general and the 
justice minister's letter to the prosecutor general, demonstrate 
that the same virtues that made Gustavo de Grieff stand out as 
the man of the year are now causing him difficulties. 
  Signed by his own hand, the prosecutor's letter tells the 
U.S. attorney general that unless the United States presents 
evidence, the war against drug trafficking will be lost; 
evidence is needed to condemn people in both countries; drug 
legalization is good provided it destroys the source of funds 
for drug traffickers; and consumer countries have no policies to 
halt consumption. 
  These are four obvious truths, which nevertheless offend the 
U.S. attorney general. The prosecutor is condemned for the 
virtue of speaking the truth without beating around the bush, 
which gained him admiration in Colombia. Something similar has 
happened to the government. The prosecutor has implemented 
surrender-to-justice policies, but the government changed the 
rules to avoid a repetition of the La Catedral Jail mistakes, 
when Escobar confessed what he wanted to. Now the confession 
must be accurate, sincere, and truthful. 
  At that time, Escobar purchased, built, and outfitted the 
prison to his needs; now imprisonment must be in high security 
jails and subject to special disciplinary regulations. The 
government wants to show the United States that it will not 
repeat past mistakes. The prosecutor only ensures law 
enforcement, as he has always done, to the admiration of the 
country.

<F P=106> [Report by Carolina Lavoe in Caracas; from the "24 Hours" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Selling the Colombian Banco Latino branch could 
partially help solve the scandal caused by the embezzlement of 
more than $2 billion by the bank's main branch in Venezuela. 
Despite the fact that an investigation by the Venezuelan 
Congress shows the Colombian Banco Latino branch operating 
normally, most of its shareholders are the same people 
responsible for the bank's bankruptcy in Venezuela. 
  [Begin Orlando Fernandez, president of the Venezuelan 
Congress Banco Latino investigating commission, recording] The 
Colombian Banco Latino branch shareholders are all practically 
the same people who robbed the bank here in Caracas, with the 
exception of certain shareholders who are front men for former 
president Carlos Andres Perez. [end recording] 
  While the woman judge investigating the case in Venezuela is 
about to issue 50 new arrest warrants, some of the alleged 
culprits are in Colombian territory. 
  [Begin Fernandez recording] Several are in Colombia. The 
wife and genius connected to all the legal machinations in 
obtaining unsecured loans, loans with false documents, all the 
operations carried out by front men, were made by a citizen 
called Lermi Mendoza, who is in Colombia. [end recording] 
  On behalf of the Colombian colony of immigrants affected by 
the financial catastrophe, Venezuelan Deputy Walter Marquez 
pointed out the principles of reciprocity that Venezuela and 
Colombia uphold. 
  [Begin Marquez recording] Many Colombians have been affected 
by this situation. We consider this serious. Colombia must act 
in reciprocity with Venezuela and deport all Banco Latino 
executives under arrest in Colombia to Venezuela as part of the 
principles of international cooperation. [end recording] 
  The Venezuelan Judicial Technical Police have executed more 
than 400 raids in connection with the Banco Latino case despite 
the fact that it is well-known and has been published in all the 
country's media that the people who are mainly responsible for 
this embezzlement are not in Venezuela.

  [Editorial Report] Buenos Aires LA PRENSA in Spanish on 24 
February published on page 5 a 900-word report on the reaction 
of the Argentine banking sector to government decree No. 146 
eliminating restrictions on foreign banks in Argentina. 
Declaring itself "on a war footing" over the new decree, the 
Association of Argentine Banks (Adeba) criticized the measure, 
which opens up financial markets in Argentina and eliminates the 
"principle of reciprocity." The association also prepared a 
document urging the government to "reevaluate" the 21 February 
decree. Adeba head Eduardo Escassany warned that an increase in 
banks in Argentina would not cause interest rates to drop. He 
asserted that "even though, in practice, reciprocity has never 
been enforced," Argentina has just lost a "bargaining chip" for 
negotiating on world markets. Former Central Bank President 
Javier Gonzalez Fraga deemed the measure "unnecessary" and 
"counterproductive," adding that globalization of the economy 
should be a "two-way street."

  [Text] (DYN-NA) -- New Buenos Aires province Security 
Secretary Alberto Piotti confirmed to Radio Continental 
yesterday that among the 11 men arrested in connection with the 
robbery of 1.8 million dollars from an armoured truck a week ago 
Monday [28 February] in General Rodriguez were a former member 
of the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP), a former Montonero 
guerrilla and two noncommissioned officers who participated in 
the 1987 Holy Week carapintada uprising. Neither Piotti nor 
Judge Cesar Lagos released their names because the investigation 
is still under way. Unofficial sources said that one of the 
gang's leaders was Miguel Angel Lopez, a member of the Federal 
Police's narcotics division, and that police have also arrested 
a driver and a security guard employed by the company that owned 
the truck, Tab-Torres. The gang also reportedly includes two 
deputy police inspectors and two other non-commissioned Army 
officers. Although a large array of weapons -- including an 
English Stirling -- was on display during a press conference 
given by Lagos Piotti denied that the gang possessed police 
vehicles.

  [Text] St. John's (Antigua), 9 Mar (DPA) -- The Antigua 
Labor Party (ALP) has garnered its fifth straight electoral 
victory by beating a unified opposition in yesterday's elections 
in this Caribbean nation, which comprises the islands of Antigua 
and Barbuda. The ALP, with 16 of the 17 electoral districts 
reporting final tallies, has secured 11 seats in the parliament, 
while the opposition United Progress Party (UPP) has won four. 
  UPP leader Baldwin Spencer is leading in his district and it 
is almost certain he will win. Therefore, the opposition party 
will have five representatives within the legislature. The last 
seat will be taken by a representative of the Island of Barbuda. 
  Although the ALP maintains control over the government, the 
election results show significant progress for the opposition. 
The UPP will increase its presence in the legislature from one 
seat in the current administration to five seats in the next. 
  In addition, the election results show Lester Bird, an ALP 
leader, will be the country's new prime minister. Bird succeeds 
his father, Vere Bird, who decided to retire from politics at 
the age of 84 after governing the nation since it gained 
independence 13 years ago.

<F P=106> [Report by Dagoberto Corea from the "First Edition" newscast] </F>
  [Text] On 7 March, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front [FMLN] criticized the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] for 
including the High Command of the Armed Forces on the team that 
will oversee and serve in an advisory capacity for the 20 March 
elections. FMLN Coordinator Shafik Handal said the inclusion of 
the High Command in the elections violates the Constitution and 
the Electoral Code. He added that the Armed Forces have always 
been used as an instrument to commit fraud. 
  [Begin Handal recording] This violates the amended 
Constitution. The Constitution specifies very different duties 
[words indistinct]. This is an attempt to give continuity to an 
Armed Forces role -- a role that exceeds the Armed Forces' 
authority. No constitutional [word indistinct] authorizes the 
Armed Forces' involvement. The Armed Forces have always been 
part of the electoral apparatus, and their soldiers and officers 
have been used as instruments to perpetrate fraud in this 
country. We have unpleasant memories of this. It is time to 
[words indistinct]. We believe pressure is being exerted here. 
[end recording] 
  Handal recalled that the National Civilian Police is the 
only 
institution authorized to provide security and surveillance in 
the 20 March elections. Meanwhile, the FMLN's Norma Guevara, 
member of the Supervisory Board [Junta de Vigilancia], stressed 
that the TSE drafted the plan without any prior consultations. 
  [Begin Guevara recording] We were puzzled by the Armed 
Forces 
High Command's inclusion in the National Collection Center 
[Centro Nacional de Recepcion], because what is involved is a 
contract to offer services and means of transportation, and this 
institution should not be involved in this. The Electoral Code 
and the Constitution forbid this. Therefore, we are demanding 
that the TSE offer an explanation and, above all, correct this 
situation as soon as possible. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, FMLN member Gerson Martinez said the latest polls 
reveal that 30-40 percent of the voters have yet to voice a 
preference in the upcoming elections.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi from La Guaira, </F>
Venezuela] 
  [Text] On 4 March, at the presidential summer residence "La 
Guzmania" near Caracas, Brazilian President Itamar Franco and 
his Venezuelan counterpart Rafael Caldera created a high-level 
binational commission that will be subdivided into various work 
groups to deal with the following issues: 
  -- Conclude the pavement of the BR 174 highway, and expand 
the agreement on land transportation. Brazil will pave 200 km 
of the highway linking Boa Vista with Santa Elena de Uairen. 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said Venezuela could 
cooperate by supplying the asphalt. 
  -- The electric sector: Brazil will purchase energy from 
Venezuela and will build the transmission lines. Interim Mines 
and Energy Minister Jose Israel Vargas said the idea is to get 
electricity for Manaus from the Guri electric plant. He also 
said discussions are being held for an exchange between Guri and 
the Balbina hydroelectric plant, because the two countries have 
weather problems. 
  -- The hydrographic sector: study the possibility of 
navigation between the Orinoco and Amazon river basins. 
President Franco said during a news conference that he 
discussed with President Caldera the interconnection of the 
Orinoco and Amazon river basins, which have an extension of 
approximately 11,000 km. The studies began in 1943. Franco 
said that what the two governments have in mind is to continue 
the studies with the objective of "reaching the River Plate 
basin." 
  -- The mineral sector: The two governments will study the 
possibility of carrying out compatible joint projects regarding 
sustainable development and the protection of the indigenous 
communities. The cooperation agreement signed in 1991 between 
the Rio Doce Valley Company (CVRD) and the Venezuelan 
Corporation of Guayana (CVG) will be useful for the development 
of such projects. Israel Vargas commented that the two countries 
are studying the possibility of using manganese from Carajas in 
Venezuelan electric furnaces. The objective is to produce iron 
alloys for the Venezuelan steel industry. He also reported that 
studies are being made for joint gold prospecting, to develop 
the border regions and employ gold prospectors in legal and 
orderly activities. 
  -- The environmental sector: joint development of ecological 
tourism, scientific research on biodiversity, and cooperation 
for recovering the deteriorated areas caused by illegal mining. 
The illegal activities in the border regions were mentioned in 
the joint communique signed by the two presidents. It says: 
"The presidents agreed on the need to fight any illegal 
activities on their common border with determination. With that 
objective they commit themselves to the reinforcement of 
appropriate measures for the eradication of illegal mineral 
prospecting in the border zones, and to carry out an effective 
control over the use of equipment and other components used in 
prospecting that contribute to the depredation and contamination 
of the environment." 
  Bolivar State Governor Andres Velasco of the Radical Cause, 
a 
leftist party that came out third in last year's presidential 
elections, said: "The Brazilian Government must reverse its 
position regarding the gold prospectors." He also said the gold 
prospectors are involved in drug trafficking. He added: "It is 
possible they are also being used by the multinationals as 
spearheads for mineral prospecting." 
  -- The Sivam [Amazon Region Surveillance System] project: 
The Venezuelan Government is studying Brazilian participation 
in carrying out ecological-economic zoning. 
  -- The hemispheric summit: The two presidents expressed 
their hopes for the upcoming summit, to be held in the United 
States this year. The two countries will make joint efforts to 
have the agenda reflect an effective hemispheric consensus. 
  -- Economic complementation agreement: The two governments 
will expedite negotiations for reaching an agreement within the 
framework of the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI). 
"Such an agreement could also include, in addition to the 
reduction of trade barriers, incentive measures for border 
trade, for promoting investment protection, for facilitating the 
trade of services, for protecting intellectual property, and 
regulations for preventing unfair competition and access to 
public biddings."

<F P=106> [Article by Francisco Tudela: "Geo-Monopoly"] </F>
  [Text] On 12 February, Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa made the talks with Bill Clinton's administration's 
very new National Economic Council fail. The talks had the 
purpose of opening the Japanese market to U.S. exports. 
<H5>  Goals and Planning </H5>
  This failure was a sign of Japanese annoyance at the U.S. 
"plan" for the Japanese market. U.S. officials, in the best 
tradition of the 1930's New Deal, requested planned 
participation in the Japanese market through previously fixed 
quantitative "goals." These "goals" do not accomplish anything 
but to destabilize Hosokawa's government, which was elected 
after a government promise to fight the large Japanese 
bureaucracy and its excessive planning. The "goals" only imply 
more planning and more paperwork for bureaucrats. 
  U.S. negotiator Mickey Kantor reacted against the Japanese 
rejection, proposing a list of harsh sanctions against Japan on 
15 February. The truth is that these sanctions would be 
ineffective because Japanese firms have so many factories abroad 
that have become, in practice, immune to sanctions. 
<H5>  Seeking Their Share </H5>
  Since then the U.S. Congress has brought back to the fore an 
old demand. Members of Congress called on Japan to buy more 
U.S. spare parts and automobiles, despite the fact that Detroit 
almost does not produce cars with the steering wheel on the 
right. Congress also is revising the "Super 301" provision 
applicable to U.S. foreign trade laws and through which the 
government can impose unilateral reprisals against other 
countries' "discriminatory practices." 
  The Americans not only reacted against Hosokawa's NO, but 
also against the Japanese refusal -- which followed the NO -- to 
respect a previous agreement giving the U.S. consortium Motorola 
a larger share of the Japanese telecommunications market. 
<H5>  The Real Problem </H5>
  These are, however, only the symptoms of a much larger 
problem: the negative U.S. trade balance with Japan. In effect, 
in January alone, the U.S. trade balance with Japan showed a 
$6.1 billion deficit, 17 percent more than last year. The 
overall Japanese trade balance surplus with the United States 
now stands at $50 billion. 
  In a fascinating article called "Let us play geo-monopoly: 
diplomacy is to occupy your time with other nations' affairs" 
(THE NEW YORK TIMES 30/Jan/94), Thomas L. Friedman points out 
the Clinton's administration's great concern with the 
insufficient Japanese purchase of U.S. exports and tells how 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen asked the Japanese Finance 
Ministry to not only reduce taxes to stimulate consumption of 
"U.S.-made products," but also requested a commitment not to 
increase the IGV [general sales tax] for two years. 
<H5>  Geo-Monopoly </H5>
  According to Friedman, U.S. Treasury officials are fully 
conscious that those measures also will imply a destabilization 
of Hosokawa's economic policies, but have decided to maintain 
the pressure. Friedman says that for the present U.S. 
administration, "all foreign policies must be economic policies 
and all economic policies must be foreign policies." Therefore, 
this new diplomacy does not stop, as in the past, at other 
countries' independent and sovereign borders, but on the 
contrary, it begins right there and sinks deeply in the social 
and economic system of other nations. 
  This new policy, baptized as "geo-monopoly" by Friedman, 
changes the traditional definition of who is a friend and who an 
enemy in the international arena. Friedman describes how for 
U.S. Treasury officials "our enemy there is bureaucracy" (in 
Japan). 
<H5>  Polyglot Joke </H5>
  Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen now are articulating an offensive against Japan 
under the flag of this new policy. Their strategy includes, 
according to Friedman, "to deliberately cause a political crisis 
(...) to pressure Japanese leaders." The Japanese, conscious of 
this fact, say, half-jokingly and-half seriously, that "the 
United States is the only opposition party here." 
  If political crises are now just tools serving U.S. economic 
diplomatic purposes, then these "jokes" will be sung in many 
languages in the future.

  [Text] Throughout an extensive interview granted to LA 
PRENSA, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo announced a number of 
measures that will be implemented within the next few days: 
  -- Special Mortgage Bonds, with longer repayment and grace 
periods than those established for Rural Mortgage Bonds, will be 
implemented for the regional economies that have crops 
(plantations) or have to transform their farming operations and 
require two or three years before harvesting their new crops. 
Cavallo pointed out: "For example, this will help transform 
fruit and vegetable production in the Rio Negro valley, northern 
Santa Fe Province, entire sectors of northwest Argentina, and 
irrigated areas where it is necessary to produce goods more in 
keeping with what the world demands today." 
  -- Cavallo noted: "We will encourage a mechanism linking the 
foreign trade chain selling the products with industrialization 
and production in Argentina. Therefore, when planting, 
harvesting, and industrialization is complete in Argentina, 
there will be an awareness that these products will actually be 
sold abroad, that a good price will be collected, and not that 
we have a product that we do not know to whom it will be sold 
and must then be raffled off." 
  -- There will be measures in the automotive industry system 
"that do not represent any change, but will actually clarify 
what will happen if there is no compensation between exports and 
imports as established by the system for 31 December 1993." 
  -- Certain "improvements in the system of capital goods and 
local production of capital goods" will be announced. The 
information on the current mechanisms for the manufacturing 
industry, agriculture, livestock, and fishing will be expanded 
so as "to facilitate the implementation of more appropriate 
technologies and better product design by small and medium-size 
companies in order to enhance quality controls." 
  -- A number of deregulation measures that "will allow a 20- 
to 25-percent cost reduction in construction" will be announced 
along with a "drastic reduction in employers' contributions" 
that will probably reach the construction industry as of 1 April 
and "after the large provinces issue their laws indicating the 
dates for reducing gross incomes." Cavallo noted: "It 
especially represents a reduction in construction costs for 
low-cost housing that will benefit the entire industry." He 
hopes for "a strong expansion of construction activities that 
will contribute to reducing unemployment and maintaining a 
dynamic economic growth rate within the next few years."

<F P=106> [Article by Ovidio Bellando] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella told LA NACION on 4 
March that after his meeting with Foreign Office head Douglas 
Hurd in London on 3 March, "he is absolutely convinced" that 
Great Britain "sees Argentine-Chilean relations with good eyes." 
  In a telephone call from the United Kingdom, the minister 
analyzed the meeting and commented on an article about it, which 
was published on 4 March. Di Tella said the British Government 
"supports rapprochement between the two countries." He added 
that if relations with Chile were good during President Aylwin's 
administration "they will be very good during the Frei 
administration, and will have still more impetus." 
  It is hard to understand Di Tella's ideas, particularly the 
emphasis given to British support of ties between Argentina and 
Chile, if facts kept in absolute secrecy until 4 March are 
ignored. These facts caused surprise and uneasiness among 
official circles. 
  The reason behind it was a donation. 
  Argentina had to conduct diplomatic actions to clarify a 
British donation to the Chilean Air Museum. 
  The donation consists of a Harrier plane that still shows 
where it was hit by Argentine bullets. The plane participated 
in the Malvinas War. The donation will be officially made on 22 
March, presided over by former iron lady Margaret Thatcher, who 
will visit Santiago from 20 to 23 March. 
  Some Argentine representatives of the media believe there is 
the clear intention of affecting the good relations being 
enjoyed by the two countries, seeking to revert to the times 
when the theory of balanced forces -- sponsored by the large 
producing centers -- was fervently complied with in Latin 
America. 
  As LA NACION reported, Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando 
Petrella traveled to Chile practically the same day Di Tella 
left for London. Chilean civilian officials who will soon be 
installed allegedly knew nothing about the issue. 
  Although Hurd's answer about the donation has not been made 
public, the Argentine foreign minister said he had received 
"full explanations" about the discussed issues. 
  In Di Tella's opinion, following the almost 80-minute 
private 
meeting with his British counterpart on 3 March, the objective 
of Thatcher's presence in Santiago are merely to sell her book 
and give a paid lecture. 
  Di Tella pragmatically said: "The possibility of receiving a 
few dollars for a book should not be disdained." 
  Di Tella said Hurd's upcoming visit to the Malvinas Islands 
has only a relative political importance. 
  The minister said his British counterpart mentioned to him 
that he has not visited the islands during the five years he has 
been in the government. 
  His visit, however, could be interpreted as a sort of 
political homage to the islanders, perhaps under pressure from 
the Conservative Party's hard wing. He will be in Malvinas the 
day marking the 12th anniversary of the arrival of Argentine 
forces on the islands on 2 April 1982. 
  During the telephone conversation, Di Tella gave the 
impression that Hurd could explain to the islanders the 
securities offered that "Great Britain is clearly seeking ways 
to cooperate over oil exploration...if that is possible."

<F P=106> [Article by Monica Dallari and Gilberto Nascimento] </F>
  [Text] Sao Paulo -- An anti-Lula [Luis Inacio Lula da 
Silva] has been found. Entrepreneurs and politicians from a 
broad variety of ideological sectors -- including those labeled 
center-right and center-left -- no longer doubt that Finance 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso has the anti-Lula image 
today. Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of the 
all-powerful Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries (FIESP), 
has said: "His candidacy is perfectly viable. He is competent 
and enjoys credibility." 
  His supporters gleefully say that Cardoso's candidacy has a 
center-left profile and is the only one capable of dividing the 
left, attracting the center, and appealing to the right. Luiz 
Eulalio de Bueno Vidigal Filho, the director-superintendent of 
Cobrasma [Brazilian Railway Material Company] -- who is another 
business big-shot -- has said: "It will be great if he becomes a 
candidate. I will work hard for his nomination." 
  Cardoso's name is accepted by the elites who do not swallow 
the type of socialism imagined by PT [Workers Party] 
presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, who has led 
all the opinion polls with a 30 percent support for the past six 
months. 
  Entrepreneur Romeu Chap Chap, president of the Brazilian 
Association of Shopping Centers, says: "There is no question 
that he is the anti-Lula candidate," adding that a correct 
implementation of the economic plan "does not depend on him 
staying at the ministry." 
  Alvaro Augusto Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo Stock 
Exchange (Bovespa), said: "Cardoso is the anti-Lula. He only 
needs to wait for his plan to be consolidated before leaving the 
government." Alcides Tapia, president of the Brazilian 
Federation of Banks (Febraban), has said that Lula and the PT 
are campaigning, and it is only natural for other groups to seek 
their own candidates. He added: "Minister Cardoso could be one 
of those candidates because he is prepared and has what is 
needed to fill the position." 
  Enthusiastic defenders of the anti-Lula candidacy think the 
minister has the basic ingredients to defeat the former Sao 
Bernardo do Campo workers leader. He has the image of a new 
politician, with credibility, experience, and a clean past. 
Lula has the same attributes, they admit, but lacks experience. 
  Other factors will also weigh in the balance when voters 
become polarized for an eventual runoff between Lula and Cardoso. 
  Gaudencio Torquato, a consultant in electoral campaigns and 
a 
Political Marketing professor at the University of Sao Paulo 
(USP), has said: "Brazilians want change but fear the jump is 
longer than they can manage unaided," adding: "Voters fear the 
unpredictability and ideas of Lula, which are considered 
revolutionary. Voters want change, but this is not the kind 
they want. In this field, Cardoso has the advantage." 
  In Torquato's analysis, Lula would be a clear favorite if 
the 
race becomes polarized against politicians like Paulo Maluf 
(PPR) [Progressive Renewal Party] or Orestes Quercia (PMDB) 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. As a political analyst, 
he dares to suggest that Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy 
will be practically unbeatable in a runoff election against 
Lula. He forecasts that result: 70-30 in favor of Cardoso.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Negotiations behind the scenes for an 
alliance between the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and 
the PFL [Liberal Front Party] -- over the presidential candidacy 
of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso -- have given rise 
to an irritating controversy within the PSDB bloc in the Senate. 
"The PSDB is currently the beautiful girl within Brazilian 
politics, but it should carefully choose its boyfriend in order 
to avoid becoming corrupt," PSDB Senator for Bahia Jutahy 
Magalhaes warned in an inflamed speech in which he advocated an 
alliance with the progressive forces. 
  Magalhaes -- the father of former Welfare Minister Jutahy 
Jr., a candidate for the governorship of Bahia, and an adversary 
of Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes -- was interrupted by PSDB 
Senator for Ceara Beni Veras, who today will be installed in his 
post at the Planning Ministry. "Making an alliance with the PT 
[Workers Party] is impossible; we can only express our support. 
The PT is a party that has fought generously for the social 
welfare of the people, but it clearly has no democratic 
commitments," Beni Veras claimed. 
  Magalhaes criticized the remarks by PSDB President Tasso 
Jereissati, who advocated an alliance with the PFL. "Tasso is 
not familiar with Brazilian politics. We cannot make a general 
jelly government, much less an electoral alliance to obtain two 
more minutes of free television propaganda time," he said, 
adding that "this is not the PSDB's path. Perhaps I should not 
mention this at this moment, but I am not a skilled politician 
and I do not like skilled politicians." Beni rebutted Tasso's 
criticism by saying that he only recalled that there are other 
forces in the political spectrum that should be considered at 
the time of defining the PSDB policy of alliances. "It is a 
constructive effort," Beni said.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Just seven months before the 
presidential elections, an unprecedented poll conducted by the 
Brazilian Political Studies Institute [Instituto Brasileiro de 
Estudos Politcos] (IBEP) yielded surprising results. IBEP asked 
which candidate the deputies and senators believe has the best 
chance of winning the elections, irrespective of their personal 
or party preferences. The conclusion turned into an 
embarrassing situation for PT [Workers Party] candidate Luis 
Inacio Lula da Silva, who is leading the street polls. One 
fifth of the entire Congress chose Lula as the candidate "with 
the best chance of being elected president," but only half of 
his party bloc chose him as Itamar Franco's successor. 
  Protected by the IBEP's commitment that full secrecy would 
be 
guaranteed, the PT bloc had two unexpected choices: 16.7 percent 
of PT bloc members considered that PMDB [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party] leader Antonio Brito has a better chance than 
Lula. They also voted for Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos 
Magalhaes, of the PFL [Liberal Front Party] (8.3 percent); Sao 
Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf, of the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] 
(8.3 percent); and Senator Mario Covas, PSDB [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party] Sao Paulo state, (8.3 percent). 
  Lula gathered votes from almost all other parties: 30 
percent 
from PDT legislators; 20 percent from the PPR; 18.6 percent from 
the PMDB; 18.2 percent from the PP [Popular Party]; and 15.3 
percent from the PFL. After Lula, the legislators chose the 
following candidates as having the best chance: Antonio Brito 
(16 percent); Paulo Maluf (11.2 percent); Antonio Carlos 
Magalhaes (7.8 percent); and Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso of the PSDB (6.39 percent). The legislators belive the 
candidates with the least chances are Orestes Quercia of the 
PMDB (who only obtained 1.5 percent of legislators' votes), and 
Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonoel Brizola of the PDT [Democratic 
Labor Party] (3.3 perent). Quercia and Brizola shared one thing 
in common; they were only chosen by members of their own party 
blocs. 
  Political Scientist Walder de Goes, the IBEP poll 
supervisor, 
said: "Legislators have always been like a measuring stick in an 
election year, and these results are more revealing than current 
street polls." Walder said the pollsters clearly explained what 
was required in the questionnaires: It was specified that this 
was not a question of personal preference, but of who they 
consider has the best chance of being elected president. 
  After explaining that the IBEP methodology has a margin of 
error that is less than 1 percent, Walder said: "We were shocked 
by the results of the poll, mainly with the lack of unity within 
the PT regarding Lula." 
  The poll was conducted on 2-10 Febraury among a sample of 
Brazilian legislators -- 104 deputies (20 percent of the Chamber 
of Deputies) and 25 Senators (30 percent of the Senate) -- was 
stratified on parties and regions encompassing five geographical 
regions and those party blocs represented in Congress on a 
proportional basis in the two houses. The polled legislators 
were drawn at random and the results were burned after being 
tabulated. 
  The poll reveals that presidential candidates continue to 
carry the votes for the rest of the ticket. The majority of 
legislators (53.5 percercent) believe that the presidential 
candidate determines the choice of the voters while 15 percent 
believe the candidates for governors decide. Some 24.3 pecent 
believe both have an equal influence on voters. The majority of 
legislators believe the mixed district vote is the best 
electoral system for the country; 62.2 percent of deputies and 
senators support this system as opposed 31.5 percent who support 
the system currently in force.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Prisoner of the Past"] </F>
  [Text] As the only self-proclaimed candidate for the 
presidency of the Republic -- in the middle of his campaign and 
with a comfortable 30 percent acceptance -- Luis Inacio Lula da 
Silva has obtained fixed coverage in the newspapers and an early 
image of invincibility. Yet, while on a honeymoon with the 
future, he nonetheless begins to show signals of decline. 
  Although this advantage over his probable contenders remains 
unchanged (an advantage that will now begin to shrink), a recent 
poll shows that the rejection rate for Lula jumped from 54 
percent in September to 80 percent at the beginning of February. 
This shows that his excursions through the interior of Brazil 
are being neutralized by the internal crisis in the PT [Workers 
Party] and by the backward and intransigent image of this 
opposition party. 
  Voters have certainly noticed the incongruity of one who 
attacks Brazilian leaders just as they are recycling themselves 
in democracy and who suggests as an alternative for Brazil a 
model that did not work anywhere in the world. 
  Surprisingly, Deputy Jose Genoino (PT-SP) [Sao Paulo] 
recently stated in an article that the decision by the party to 
abstain from the constitutional reform process -- which was 
imposed by the radical majority of the PT executive board -- is 
equivalent to partially curtailing the political mandate of PT 
congressmen. 
  What is worse, this abstention has seriously damaged the 
PT's 
public image by disseminating the idea that it is a sectarian 
party. Genoino believes the decision resembles the centralist 
and authoritarian tradition of the decayed Communist parties, 
and that it will harm the candidacy of Lula just as a ferocious 
struggle over state reform and economic matters that affects the 
workers' lives is taking place. 
  We must repeat: These opposition party members are not 
progressive; they are conservative, they do not evolve, they 
block congress sessions, and they torpedo initiatives. Their 
stubbornness in defending the intangibility of a Constitution 
they did not even sign is incongruous. The only explanation is 
that the PT does not believe a market economy cannot be refined, 
and it harbors the unconfessed wish to destroy it. 
  The public is nonetheless receptive to test demonstrations. 
It is very well known that the privatization of the iron and 
steel mills has increased the productivity of that industry, 
lowered prices for its clients, and improved the lives of the 
workers and employees who bought their shares. 
  In face of this highly obvious fact, what is the meaning of 
the position of a Trotskyist economist member of the PT 
executive board like Marcus Sokol, who intends to annul all the 
privatizations already done? How did these fundamentalists -- 
who are middle-class professors, lawyers, journalists, and 
sociologists -- kidnap the party from the hands of the Catholic 
and labor union leadership? 
  It was very simple: The concentration of PT congressmen in 
Brasilia and Lula's indecisiveness in face of the dogmatic wing 
has made the congressmen prisoners of abstract principles and 
simplistic slogans. Although he has the power to exert a vote 
of wisdom -- as president of the PT -- in favor of participation 
in the constitutional reform process, Lula preferred to abstain 
from giving an order and opened the back door to the Shiites. 
  That is the reason for the PT's disquieting polarization, 
ambivalence, and double talk. Touring the north and northeast 
with his entourage, Lula -- wearing a straw hat -- said the PT 
star "is the guide for the birth of Jesus" [as published]. In 
Rio Grande do Sul Lula promised farmers that he would reduce 
imports and increase subsidies. At the Fiesp [Sao Paulo State 
Federation of Industries] he made people believe his party's 
radical positions are not for real. 
  The fact that Lula used the word "citizons" ["cidadoes," 
instead of "citizens"] is not serious, but to lead a party 
haunted by contradictory ghosts of reform and revolution, of 
competency and subsidies, and economic criteria and populist 
messianism, is serious. 
  The serious fact is that Lula lacks administrative 
experience, he has never been mayor or governor, but now he 
intends to know Brazil through a hurried tour from the dry 
shrublands to the pampas. VEJA magazine's front page article 
this week is about Lula's visit to southern Brazil, and it 
states: "Just 48 hours after spending a few moments in southern 
Brazil, Lula had earned the right to say; `I know Brazil from 
Oiapoque to Chui.'" 
  For Lula, hurriedness and perfection go together.

<F P=106> [Article by Aziz Filho and Daniella Sholl] </F>
  [Text] The days of [Rio de Janeiro] Governor Leonel 
Brizola's silence are numbered. In his second race for 
president of the Republic, Brizola is preparing himself to leave 
the governorship on 2 April and take up what he describes as 
"the most overwhelming discourse since 1964." Interviewed by 
JORNAL DO BRASIL, Brizola for the first time acknowledged that 
he is a candidate, admitted the PDT's [Democratic Labor Party] 
isolation in the field of national political alliances, and 
explained that his reserve is part of a strategy: "My candidacy 
represents a duty to the party. We will not follow the 
conventional rules. We will seek to unite all Brazilians 
against everything there is." 
  Brizola added: "I even believe it will be possible for a 
candidate to challenge everything, win in an unconventional way, 
and still achieve a majority in Congress. So you can see what 
kind of plans I am making." In Brizola's opinion, "the people 
united, without politicians," could repeat the upset victory of 
the presidential system during the plebiscite, when most party 
leaderships favored a parliamentary system. Brizola thinks that 
for the PDT to run with its own candidate as a third option -- 
after the PT [Workers Party] and the anti-PT faction -- it is 
more important to assemble "strong and austere tickets in all 
states" than to seek leadership alliances. 
  The governor said that the economic plan and the movement 
around Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy have encouraged him 
to run and show voters that everything "is just one more 
manipulation of the economy for electoral purposes." 
  "The plan did not attack the most important causes of 
inflation, the financial system or banks, which need to be 
better supervised," Brizola attacked, giving advance notice of 
one of his hottest campaign issues. He denied any concern over 
the high rejection rate of a Brizola government. "The stronger 
the wind, the higher the eagle can fly," he answers. 
  At 72 and in his third term as governor, Brizola still 
believes he can run as a candidate of renewal. He bets that 
this time the people will learn about and compare the 
candidate's backgrounds. "Brazil is like a ship that has sprung 
a leak and cannot be handled by an inexperienced sailor," 
Brizola said. 
  "In order to overcome the crisis we need renewal, the 
promotion of new people. That can be accomplished only by a 
candidate from outside, a candidate who is not moving in the 
contaminated climate of politicians of which the people are 
tired," the governor said, trying to justify his isolation. 
  He was discouraged about the possibility of getting support 
from the small PC-B [Communist Party of Brazil] and the PSB 
[Brazilian Socialist Party] of Miguel Arraes, with which the PDT 
is trying to form an alliance. "We would like that, but it 
seems that the PC-B will join the PT. Arraes is also leaning 
that way to strengthen his candidacy in Pernambuco." Brizola 
said he was not surprised. He compared himself with Getulio 
Vargas, recalling that "Communists were against Vargas in 1954 
but changed their minds following his suicide, when they saw the 
people burning communist newspapers and attacking the 
multinationals." 
  Brizola characterized his candidacy as "a duty to the party" 
and promised to dedicate more time to it than he did 1989. "In 
1989 I did not run to win. It was just training." Brizola 
ruled out the possibility of joining the PT at some point during 
the presidential campaign. He treated Lula [Luis Inacio Lula da 
Silva] with the virulence of a person attacking his number one 
enemy. 
  "The euphoria of the past elections did not permit us to see 
that neither one of the two candidates were fit to rule. I will 
tell Lula to his face, the first time I see him, that only an 
ignorant person would vote for someone who does not have the 
minimum administrative experience, and who has spent four years 
without working, traveling at the party's expense. Why doesn't 
he go back to his lathe? Perhaps he finds that demeaning," 
Brizola fired. Asked about his activities during the period he 
was out of public office, between 1986 and 1990, he said that he 
spent that time working as "a rural producer" at his Uruguayan 
ranch. 
  If Lula is his number one enemy, Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
seems to be number two. Brizola characterized the minister's 
possible presidential candidacy as "a color balloon, not of the 
kind that people let go of during the Sao Joao celebration, but 
of the kind that only exist on television screens." "Cardoso is 
a toucan [nickname for Cardoso's party, the Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party, PSDB] with a lot of feathers, a ballroom bird 
who will not withstand the campaign heat."

<F P=106> [Article by Dora Kramer] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso already has told President Itamar Franco that on 25 
March he will announce whether he will remain in the Finance 
Ministry or run as PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] 
candidate for the presidency of the Republic. Furthermore, the 
PSDB bloc should approach Cardoso today to ask him to announce 
his decision this week. 
  Everyone is under the impression that Fernando Henrique will 
run for election because if his decision was to remain as 
finance minister, there would be no reason to postpone the 
announcement. Deputy Joao Abraao, one of the most involved in 
Finance Ministry affairs, commented: "If he announced now that 
he will continue as finance minister, he would end the 
speculation regarding the name of his replacement." 
  The movement -- still rather surreptitious -- of currents 
for 
or against this or that name during the past days has increased 
expectations, irritated people, and stirred up ancient 
ill-feelings. On 7 March, during a trip from Rio de Janeiro to 
Brasilia, a member of the economic team did not conceal his 
annoyance over politicians' negative comments about Finance 
Ministry experts. According to the expert, the purpose of those 
who criticize economic team members one by one is precisely to 
demoralize the entire team in order to get Cardoso to remain in 
the ministry and thus prevent him from running in the elections. 
The actions, according to this argument, are allegedly 
orchestrated by another candidate who aspires to the presidency. 
  This theory may even make some sense regarding a specific 
group of politicians but there are some within the PSDB federal 
bloc who openly uphold the names of Pedro Malan and Edmar Bacha 
for this post. According to this theory, the two allegedly meet 
the necessary requirements because they are well acquainted with 
the economic plan and will be capable of efficiently 
implementing it. Negotiations with Congress, in the case of a 
technical solution, may be conducted by Fernando Henrique 
himself, who would resume his seat in the Senate. 
  Rubens Ricupero, who until not long ago made a point of 
saying -- rather jokingly -- that he would rather seek asylum in 
Switzerland than run the Brazilian economy, may be the big 
surprise. Ricupero gained a lot of experience and international 
prestige in the foreign trade field through his work with GATT 
and has received significant support from the business sector. 
  The possibility that the finance minister might postpone his 
decision even more, in keeping with the amendment extending the 
deadline for governors and ministers to resign until 2 July, is 
dismissed by the PSDB. The reason for this is, according to 
information available on 7 March, that 80 percent of the PSDB 
deputies and senators are against the proposal because they 
believe it is tied to circumstances and, instead of helping, 
will mortally wound the credibility of Fernando Henrique's 
candidacy. 
  The possible replacements: 
  Pedro Malan: Central Bank president and one of the most 
mentioned candidates to replace Fernando Henrique. His 
supporters are in every area: ministries, the economic field, 
Congress, and within the PSDB itself. There might be someone 
better acquainted with the economic plan, but Malan is always 
regarded as the expert with the best minister-like face. 
  Edmar Bacha: Special Finance Ministry adviser. Was one of 
the experts most involved in drafting the economic plan. He has 
the advantage of also having being greatly involved in the 
Cruzado Plan and, therefore, fully aware of the causes of the 
failure of the Funaro plan. He enjoys the support of economist 
deputies; he is regarded as arrogant by political circles. 
  Rubens Ricupero: Current environment and legal Amazon region 
minister, was Franco's first choice as finance minister. He 
rejected the offer in his capacity as ambassador with the excuse 
that he had spent too much time out of the country. Now he 
believes he is fully acquainted with Brazilian problems. At 
Planalto Palace he enjoys the support of institutional 
communications adviser Augusto Marzagao. 
  Osiris Lopes: Federal Revenue Secretary and favorite of 
presidential secretary general Mauro Durante, who wants to 
promote him. The problem is the public arguments in which he 
calmly engaged with the economic team regarding tax increases. 
  Tasso Jereissati: PSDB president, he almost became finance 
minister during [Jose] Sarney's administration. Now, however, 
he has the obstacle of the elections because, running again for 
the Ceara governorship, it is quite unlikely he will be elected. 
He is finely attuned to Fernando Henrique. 
  Beni Varas: This senator will be sworn in today as planning 
minister and, although discreetly, he already is mentioned as 
one of the possible leaders of the economy. Politically, he 
would be a God-sent gift for the PSDB.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso has threatened to reduce the import tax rates to prevent 
speculation. Cardoso promised: "We are going to reduce the 
import tax rates and bring cheaper products into the country." 
His strategy is based on the "surprise factor." Whoever doubts 
the government's capacity to discourage abusive price increases, 
Fernando Henrique maintains that he is prepared to face 
speculators. "We are prepared to act firmly, especially against 
prices established by oligopolies. These increases have a short 
life if we have a firm government -- and we do. We are 
determined to lower those prices, and we are not going to 
announce how we are going to do so," he exclaimed. 
  Fernando Henrique said that he is going to use imports only 
to halt price markups. The minister hopes that with the 
beginning of the harvest prices will start to drop, but insisted 
he is going to fight price increases. "These increases were 
attributed to a possible price freeze, but the government did 
and will not freeze prices. Therefore, it is mere speculation." 
  As for salaries, the minister does not believe in an 
automatic salary adjustment for the inflation rate because "the 
URV [real value unit] will automatically adjust salaries." 
"There will only be a real salary increase when prices do not 
increase. That business of increasing salaries by 80 percent 
and prices by 120 percent is deceitful, and I do not agree with 
it." Once again Fernando Henrique said that the minimum salary 
is "very low," but insisted that this problem cannot be solved 
by decree. "I want the minimum salary to become a mere 
reference figure, that in practice it not be the salary earned 
by anyone, because if this could be solved by decree I would 
increase it to $500 instead of $100."

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- Xenophobic nationalism is declining in 
the Brazilian Congress. In accordance with a survey conducted 
by the Brasilia-based Brazilian Institute of Political Studies 
(IBEP), 83.2 percent of Brazilian congressmen described as "very 
important" the role of foreign capital in bringing about the 
resumption of economic growth. Furthermore, 89.9 percent of 
deputies support free association between Brazilian and foreign 
companies, and 92.9 percent of them consider the technology 
brought in by foreign companies to be good for the country. 
  The IBEP survey polled all 503 deputies and 81 senators. 
Regarding legal and tax aspects, the survey shows that most 
congressmen want equal treatment for both national and foreign 
companies. A total of 49.6 percent of all the congressmen 
surveyed believe it to be inadvisable to establish a legal 
discrimination between companies because of the origin of their 
capital, while 41.6 percent believe such companies should be 
treated differently. Only 27.2 percent approve of a different 
tax regime for companies of foreign and Brazilian capital, while 
67.2 percent of them disapprove of such discrimination. 
  This trend may be construed as a shift in the average 
opinion 
of congressmen. Deputy Augusto Carvalho of the PPS [People's 
Socialist Party] -- the former Brazilian Communist Party -- in 
Brasilia is an example of this change. He said: "I changed. 
The left changed. Congress changed." He added: "We are not 
against foreign capital, which will create companies and bring 
technology to the country." In his opinion, Brazilian companies 
cannot be considered to be sacred. He said: "We are not going 
to act as protective shields to bad local businessmen in the 
name of a so-called national industry." 
  The survey also shows that Congress is questioning the 
monopoly prevailing in the area of telecommunications. To 48 
percent of congressmen, the installation of telecommunications 
infrastructural facilities (telephone lines and exchanges) 
should be jointly undertaken by the state and by private 
companies. Only 33.6 percent believe this endeavor should be 
exclusively entrusted to Brazilian companies.

  [Text] A survey by two energy experts -- professors Adriano 
Pires Rodrigues and Danilo de Souza Dias from Rio de Janeiro 
Federal University -- concluded that if the oil monopoly is 
maintained, our country will become increasingly dependent on 
oil imports. 
  Petrobras is not in a position to make the required 
investments -- $102 billion through the year 2010 -- to maintain 
the current production rate, representing 55 percent of total 
oil consumption. 
  The professors recommend the participation of other 
enterprises in the exploration of new areas and a law to 
regulate this activity.

<F P=106> [From the "Coluna do Castello" column by Marcelo Pontes] </F>
  [Text] Planalto Palace is taking all legal precautions in 
preparation for a provisional measure to put price speculators 
in jail. President Itamar Franco and [Finance] Minister 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso asked the government's legal advisers 
to present just a legally very well-founded text. 
  Franco and Cardoso fear that some gap will allow an 
injunction or a habeas corpus writ to have the imprisoned 
speculator released in just a few hours, demoralizing the 
government's action when the government strongly needs to 
demonstrate energy. 
  The preparation of this provisional measure demonstrates 
that 
the government finally admits to having committed a mistake in 
launching an economic program that merely takes care of wages. 
The economic team, scorched by the failure of the Cruzado 
Plan's price freeze in 1986, avoided meddling with prices. 
  Challenged by indiscriminate price increases, the government 
now faces a much more dangerous threat to the economy's 
stabilization than the unclear votes in Congress, where the 
program's future and the future of the finance minister's 
candidacy for president of the Republic are at stake. This 
threat is so real that there already exists URV [Real Value 
Unit] inflation, as demonstrated by any price survey at 
supermarkets. 
  Even the cries, fiscal terrorism, threats to expose the 
privacy of income taxes or open up the country to imports, and 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's public anger have not been 
enough to prevent price abuses. The government is facing the 
following dilemma: Either it becomes strongly involved, putting 
some speculators in jail to demonstrate that it has not lost the 
economy's control mechanisms, or the economic program and the 
minister's candidacy will fail. 
  The prices issue also has become a key issue in the 
discussion of the economic program in Congress. Deputy Miro 
Teixeira, the new Chamber of Deputies Economy Committee 
chairman, who belongs to the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] and 
obviously supports [Rio de Janeiro] Governor Leonel Brizola as a 
candidate for president of the Republic, on 7 March asked for an 
expert in price monitoring to advise him. In Teixeira's 
opinion, URV inflation, which he believes ranges between 4 and 6 
percent, has begun to destroy the reputation of Minister 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso's program.

  [Editorial Report] Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in 
Portuguese on 6 March, on page 8, carries an approximately 
800-word report by Vasconcelo Quadros on the worst crisis the 
Federal Police, PF, has experienced in its history. 
  The report notes that with only 4,200 members, a little more 
than half what it had in the 80's, the PF is plagued by 
unbridled corruption, the improper discharge of duties, 
disagreements, lack of leadership, and disrespect for the chain 
of command, etc. 
  The article says the PF is losing the main characteristic of 
any police force -- its desire to investigate, and mentions 
cases that reveal the PF agents' apathy about investigations. 
  Quadros then mentions cases that reveal how PF agents 
discharge their duties inefficiently, engage in corruption, do 
not respect the chain of command, and are involved in crimes, 
including rape.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- The National Institute of Space 
Research (INPE) already is testing Embratel's [Brazilian 
Telecommunications Company] communications satellite 
Brasilsat-B1, which should be launched in June. This will be 
the first of two satellites that will be part of the second 
generation of Embratel's communications satellites. 
Brasilsat-B1, which arrived in Sao Jose dos Campos on 28 
February, will be subject to final integration tests at INPE's 
Integration and Testing Laboratory (LIT) until the end of April. 
After being tested, the satellite will be transported to the 
Arianespace's Kourou launch in French Guyana, from where it will 
be transported into space by an Ariane rocket. 
  The tests at INPE, supervised by experts from INPE and 
Hughes 
Aircraft Co. -- a Los Angeles enterprise that built the 
satellite, will verify all the Brasilsat-B1 systems. 
<H5>  Second Generation </H5>
  The Brasilsat-B1 and B2 are the same type and look like the 
first-generation satellites--Brasilsat-A1 and A2, but are more 
advanced technologically and have better performance. The 
signals the new satellites send to earth are much more powerful. 
  The service life of the two satellites that will be 
replaced, 
Brasilsat-A1 and A2, estimated at eight to 10 years, is almost 
up. According to Embratel, their replacement will not affect the 
users, not even those who have parabolic antennas, who will 
continue to receive their television programs normally. The new 
satellites have an approximately 12-year service life, which 
means that Brazil's communications are guaranteed until the year 
2006.

<F P=106> [Article by Francisco Goncalves] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- The Brazilian Government has decided to 
take advantage of the economic opening promoted by Vietnam to 
conquer new consumer markets. Interested in increasing its 
commercial ties with Asian countries, the Brazilian Foreign 
Ministry has included Vietnam among the countries with which it 
intends to step up trade. Situated in a region showing the 
highest commercial growth rate in the world, Vietnam, from 
Itamarati's viewpoint, may also become an important Brazilian 
partner in the oil field. 
<H5>  Cats </H5>
  In the next few months the first Brazilian commercial 
mission 
will travel to Vietnam to seek new markets for the Brazilian 
exporters. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said: "Brazil does 
not want to remain behind. This is why we want to approach the 
Asian tigers while they are still cats." He explained that the 
government wants to step up commercial relations with the 
remaining countries of the region, as is already the case with 
China. 
  Currently, trade with Asia represents only 16 percent of the 
total volume of Brazilian imports and exports. Amorin said: 
"Those countries' potential is enormous, and we want to secure 
a good portion of that market." The minister revealed that the 
Brazilian mission will also have a political nature. The 
Brazilian Government wants to establish an embassy in Hanoi to 
show that it intends to tighten diplomatic relations between the 
two countries. Currently, the Brazilian Embassy in Singapore is 
in charge of the diplomatic contacts with Vietnam. 
  A diplomat in charge of arranging the visit to Vietnam 
commented: "Above all, the Brazilian mission has an exploratory 
nature. We know little about that country and want to open new 
commercial fronts." According to the diplomat, by opening its 
economy, Vietnam will offer Brazilian businessmen new 
opportunities, especially in the foodstuff and heavy machinery 
fields. He added: "During the first talks we had regarding the 
trip, local authorities recalled that Vietnam has already 
purchased Brazilian-made tractors, but that they lack spare 
parts for them." 
  Last year Brazilian exports to that country amounted to $4.2 
million, while imports amounted to approximately $13.5 million. 
During the first three months of 1993, Brazil imported some $2.7 
million worth of rice which is equivalent to 11,900 tonnes of 
rice. The chemical and industrial equipment industries were 
responsible for most of the Brazilian exports to Vietnam. 
<H5>  Petroleum </H5>
  Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation], Braspetro 
[Petrobras International, Inc.], and Furnas [Furnas Electric 
Power Plant, Inc.] have expressed interest in the mission due to 
Vietnam's oil reserves. Representatives of the three companies 
will comprise the mission that will leave for Vietnam during the 
second half of April. Petrobras has already informed the 
Brazilian diplomats that it wants to contact Vietnamese 
enterprises of the lubricant industry. 
  Brazilian construction companies are also interested in 
Vietnam, with a population of some 70 million inhabitants, that 
is in the process of consolidating the adoption of a market 
economy. The Andrade Gutierrez, Camargo Correia, and Norberto 
Odebrecht companies will also be represented in the commercial 
mission. Andrade Gutierrez Director General Ildeu Olyntho de 
Freitas asserted: "We are closely watching the opening of the 
Vietnamese economy and want more information on the fields in 
which we can work." He admitted the possibility of the company 
participating in the construction of infrastructure projects in 
that Asian country. The businessman said: "Right now, we know 
little about Vietnam but we want to work in that region."

<F P=106> [Article by Kristina Michaelles] </F>
  [Text] Sao Paulo -- With a single pen stroke Brazil may be 
throwing away the equivalent of $18 million which had been 
earmarked for the demarcation of indigenous reservations, and 
wasting three and a half years of difficult negotiations, as the 
funds have already been approved by the German Government. 
According to Environment Ministry figures for February, the 
Brazilian Government has already spent $84,000 on technical 
missions for negotiating this project. 
  The request for the exclusion of the indigenous reservations 
project is contained in a letter sent by the Foreign Ministry to 
the German Government on 23 February. In the letter, the 
Foreign Ministry suggests modifications in the memorandum about 
bilateral participation within the framework of the Pilot 
Program for the Preservation of Brazilian Tropical Forests, 
which totals 68 million German marks ($40 million). The 
Indigenous Reservations Demarcation project had already been 
approved by an interministerial commission to which the Foreign 
Ministry also belongs. 
<H5>  Protest </H5>
  The fax sent to the Germans has elicited a strong protest 
from Dinarte Nobre de Medeiros, president of Funai [National 
Indian Foundation], who defined the Foreign Ministry decision as 
"inappropriate and untimely." In a fax sent on 3 March to the 
Environment Ministry, which is responsible for negotiating the 
overall Pilot Program, Medeiros said: "We would be entirely 
paralyzed as far as the regularization of indigenous territories 
is concerned." 
  The Brazilian Government's refusal to accept money from 
abroad for the demarcation of indigenous lands has taken place 
only a few days before the 20 March meeting to be held in 
Brussels. The main donors of funds for the Pilot Program (the 
World Bank, the Group of Seven wealthy countries, and the 
European Union) will participate in the Brussels meeting. This 
refusal could irreversibly affect other projects in the program. 
  Roberto Smeraldi, who coordinates Amazon region matters for 
the organization Friends of the Earth, said: "This is a serious 
matter, because the Germans are the main financial backers of 
the Pilot Program for the Amazon Region, and this attitude could 
end up damaging Brazil in the eyes of the other donors." In his 
opinion the consequences of this attitude regarding the Pilot 
Program could be "unthinkable." 
  The Indigenous Rights Nucleus, Friends of the Earth, and the 
Amazon Region Work Group have already sent a joint letter to 
German and Brazilian authorities warning them about the unusual 
unilateral decision made by the Foreign Ministry. 
<H5>  Battle </H5>
  The Foreign Ministry fax reveals that there is a hard battle 
going on inside government between the sector opposing the use 
of foreign resources for the demarcation of Indian lands, in the 
name of national sovereignty, and those who did their best to 
obtain foreign help to compensate for the budget cutbacks 
conducted a few weeks ago, which have practically eliminated the 
resources earmarked for the demarcation of indigenous lands. Of 
the $39 million requested by Funai, only $1.8 million (5 percent 
of the overall amount requested) was approved by the Federal 
Government Budget Department. 
  This is one more chapter preceding the political-juridical 
battle over the constitutional revision process. There are 
already 232 proposals and amendments related to Indians' rights. 
Some of them even seek to prevent the demarcation of indigenous 
lands on the border strip, where nearly 200 reservations are 
located.

<F P=106> [Article by Nelson Franco Jobim] </F>
  [Text] If the economic stabilization plan of Finance 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is successful, it will be the 
first timid and restrained step by Brazil to face the greatest 
challenge of its foreign policy at the end of this century: to 
integrate itself with the system of commercial blocs which 
characterizes the new economic world order and to take advantage 
of the opportunities of growth by preserving the diversification 
of its economy and the multilateral policy of its foreign trade. 
  President Itamar Franco and Foreign Minister Celso Amorim 
have already defined the Brazilian strategy: to strengthen the 
Common Market of the South (Mercosur) and to attract other 
countries toward a Latin American free trade zone, and only then 
negotiate with the United States the creation of a Free Trade 
Hemispheric Area (AHLC) as proposed in 1990 by U.S. President 
George Bush upon launching the Americas Initiative. 
  The creation of a South American free trade zone, as 
proposed 
by President Itamar Franco to the Rio Group in Chile last 
October, will be discussed by the finance and foreign ministers 
of the Mercosur on 9 and 10 March in Buenos Aires. 
  Paulo Nogueira Batista, the Brazilian representative before 
the ALADI [Latin American Integration Association], said: "First 
it is necessary to bring South America closer together, to 
integrate the Mercosur and the Andean Pact, and also to attract 
Chile," adding: "We will try to transform the Mercosur into a 
customs union and at the same time create a South American free 
trade zone." 
  Environment Minister Rubens Ricupero, former ambassador to 
the United States and former Brazilian representative before the 
GATT, said: The first condition is the stability of the economy. 
To win and expand markets it is necessary to have an industrial 
and investment policy, adding: "The 14-percent investment rate 
in 1992 was the lowest in history. In the 1970's investments 
amounted to 25 percent of the GDP." 
  Ricupero said: The investment in the 1970's is what made 
Brazil the third country in export growth in 1992, only slightly 
behind Hong Kong (20 percent), and China (17 percent), and next 
to Malaysia (15 percent). He indicated: "If we are unable to 
curb inflation, we will not be a trustworthy partner and there 
will be no distribution of profits. The opening of the market 
demands competition and investment." 
  Economist Yves Chaloult, a professor of the University of 
Brasilia, said in Bulletin No 9 of the Latin American 
Integration publication of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry: 
Globalization has strengthened the irreversible trend toward the 
regionalization of the economic and political areas, and the 
formation of blocs. He added: "Brazil is going through a 
profound state crisis" with "constant oscillations in 
macroeconomic policies" and "an uncontrolled inflation with a 
very high social cost." 
  Ricupero said: "Brazil must maintain the diversification of 
its exports" through regionalization without exclusions by 
maintaining its good presence in European markets, and by 
expanding its trade with Asia. Pure and simple support for 
NAFTA makes no sense. It would be better to negotiate within 
Mercosur. He added: "There is no advantage in an overall 
negotiation with the United States. They make more money than we 
do. Negotiation should be selective, partial, gradual, and 
progressive like in the GATT." 
  According to a World Bank study, the 47 percent of all 
Brazilian exports that go to the United States have to compete 
with Mexico, which is in a privileged position both because it 
is a member of NAFTA and also because of its geographical 
position. This is one important factor, in addition to the 
complementation of their economies, in the success of 
international trade. For example, Brazilian orange juice may be 
a loser. 
  A relationship with NAFTA is threatening to destroy 
Mercosur. 
In June 1991, Mercosur and the United States signed in 
Washington a four plus one agreement creating a consultative 
council to discuss trade and investments. Argentina now wants 
to become a member of NAFTA, as well as Mercosur, by the middle 
of this year. If Brazil has its way, it will have to wait. 
  Paulo Nogueira Batista finds it very difficult to negotiate 
a 
free trade agreement with the United States, which has an 
economy 11 times larger than Brazil, in addition to a world 
leadership that puts its interests in relation to Asia, for 
example, way in front of hemispheric integration. Nogueira 
Batista said: "Latin-American countries have production and 
trade that are of no great importance for the United States. 
The United States has an income per capita 10 times greater and 
a solid integration can only exist if there is a minimum of 
equilibrium." 
  Nogueira Batista added: "In fact the free trade agreement 
between the United States and Mexico is meant to separate rather 
then to unite. Manpower transfers have been excluded. The idea 
is to foster Mexico's development with U.S. investment and an 
increased entry of Mexican products into the U.S. market so that 
Mexican manpower will not migrate to the United States." 
  NAFTA formalizes integration among the United States, 
Canada, 
and Mexico that already existed in practice. In 1990, the 
United States purchased 75.4 percent of Mexican exports. In the 
1950's, the United States purchased 75 percent of Brazilian 
exports. Today, it barely purchases 19.9 percent of Brazilian 
exports. 
  The Brazilian representative to ALADI noted: "The signing of 
this type of agreement does not represent a priority for Brazil, 
or for the United States, which intends to remain a world power. 
It will not resign itself to becoming a regional power. Chile, 
Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, and other Latin American 
countries are experiencing an economic adjustment process. They 
view negotiations with the United States as a recognition that 
will afford them international prestige with financial 
repercussions. It will help them finance their balance of 
payments requirements." 
  This view coincides with that of Paula Stern, an economic 
adviser during Clinton's electoral campaign, who endorses the 
possibility of Chile and Singapore joining NAFTA "and thus 
remove Asia's fear that NAFTA will discriminate against Asia or 
that the United States has decided to ignore Asia." In fact the 
situation is quite the contrary, as U.S. State Secretary Warren 
Christopher said: "The 21st Century will be the century of the 
Pacific." 
  Brazil has always used low-cost manpower and its abundant 
natural resources to compete on the international market. But 
following the great changes that occurred during the past 
decades, Brazil must invest much more in science, technology, 
and professional qualifications. While the ROK is ready to 
become the first country to widely spread secondary education, 
the average Brazilian studies for a total of three years and 
eight months. 
  Ambassador Rubens Ricupero notes: "We export 
semi-manufactured products to the Asian tigers that process them 
into much higher value-added products." He noted: "We have lost 
ground following the failure of the protected computer market 
policy. In textiles, we have lost ground to China, India, and 
Pakistan that have lower cost manpower. Concerning steel, 
oranges, iron ore, and soybeans, we rather depend on quantity. 
Nowadays, many products exported by Brazil come from 
competitive areas like the Tupi motors from Santa Catarina State 
or Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company] planes. 
  Brazilian exports grew from $1.654 billion in 1967 to $27 
billion in 1984 due to the promotion policies and the domestic 
consumption decline caused by the recession of the early 1980's. 
Ever since, Brazilian exports have been damaged by declining 
investments and economic instability, thus becoming vulnerable 
to competition from Asian and East European countries that have 
abundant natural resources and low-cost manpower. 
  In issue No.23 of the BNDES [National Bank for Economic and 
Social Development] Studies [Estudos BNDES] -- An introduction 
of Brazilian exports into the international trade of goods: An 
area study -- Jorge Chami Batista from the Foundation of Foreign 
Trade Studies Center [Fundacao Centro de Estudos de Comercio 
Exterior], recommends "increasing the industrial manufacturing 
ratio through modern technology and better qualified human 
resources" to reduce this vulnerability. 
  This study confirms that Brazil has "a relatively 
diversified 
exports structure" and that participation in the international 
markets is directly linked to the use of natural resources, 
which grows commensurate to the use of these resources. 
Nevertheless, the demand for those products for which Brazil 
has competitive advantages is growing very slowly.

<F P=106> [Report by Raimundo Lopez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 28 Feb (PL) -- Polls show that the 
preliminary results on the consultations with workers on 
measures to clean up domestic finances encourage optimism among 
the population on Cuba's capacity to emerge from these adverse 
economic moments. 
  A comparison study of two polls carried out in January and 
February shows the trust Cubans have in the results of this 
consultation process, said Dario Machado, director of the social 
political studies center, in charge of the polls. 
  Preliminary data shows that the percentage of people who 
responded positively to the question of whether the consultation 
process has awakened enthusiasm among workers, climbed from 62 
percent in January, to 80 percent in February. 
  Local authorities have put off taking any measures to reduce 
the imbalance of domestic finances until the results of the 
broad study made in factories and other work sectors are 
received, including private farming, which began in January at 
the initiative of the Cuban Workers Federation. 
  The official decision to face the difficult economic moment 
(caused by the loss of the country's main partners, the former 
Soviet-European socialist field) without changing principles of 
social justice, encourage financial maladjustments or its 
worsening, local sources indicate. 
  State Committee for Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez 
recently recalled that despite the situation, Cuba maintains 
average employment and income levels, similar to 1989; in 
addition, Cuba raised health and social security budgets 10 
percent and 33 percent, respectively, compared to 1989. 
  President Fidel Castro said that to face the economic 
difficulties, neoliberal mechanisms of dramatic consequences in 
other countries would not be used, and no Cuban will be left 
unprotected. 
  In the work site debates, popularly known as the workers' 
parliament, workers suggest ideas to improve productive 
efficiency in their direct activity, and immediately afterward, 
they propose alternatives to solve the country's problems. 
  Results from the polls by the social economic center show 
that the percentage of people who trust that this consultation 
process will yield useful proposals, increased from 75 percent 
in January to 84 percent in February. 
  Likewise, Machado reported, the number of those who believe 
that this consultation process is worthwhile increased from 86 
percent in January to 91 percent in February. 
  Conversely, the first poll showed that only 0.2 percent of 
those polled called for a change in the economic system, 0.3 
percent were concerned that workers' suggestions were not taken 
into account, and 4.7 percent believed that these measures would 
not be effective. 
  Work site meetings will last until 15 March and the workers' 
proposals will be taken by the Cuban Workers Federation to the 
country's highest levels, including the National Assembly of the 
People's Government. 
  The parliament, which last year made a preliminary analysis 
of the situation, plans to hold an extraordinary session -- date 
has not been announced yet -- to consider the domestic financial 
situation.

<F P=106> [Report by Miguel Lozano] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 1 Mar (PL) -- A ranking Cuban official today 
confirmed the Cuban Government's decision to go ahead with the 
normalization of relations with emigres and to eliminate all the 
stumbling blocks on the path to this goal. 
  Jose Ramon Balaguer, a member of the Communist Party 
Politburo and head of the party's ideology department, told 
PRENSA LATINA the government's decision is very clear and will 
not be reversed. 
  Balaguer's assertions were made shortly after a meeting with 
Amalio Fiallo, a Cuban resident of Venezuela, who recently 
organized a workshop on participative democracy theories in the 
city of Camaguey, approximately 700 km east of Havana. 
  The Communist leader said the Camaguey meeting, which was 
also attended by Cuban emigres who reside in the United States, 
besides examining an important topic like democracy, promoted 
improved relations between Cubans on and off the island. 
  Now we have a better understanding of our differences and 
diversity of concepts and also of the things that bring us 
together, asserted Balaguer, who spoke highly of the workshop 
and about two previous seminars conducted by Fiallo in Havana. 
  In Balaguer's opinion, these seminars are part of a process 
to normalize relations with the Cuban community abroad, which 
the government will not allow to be hindered by radical emigre 
sectors or the hostility of the United States, where most Cubans 
abroad reside. 
  Balaguer pointed out that it is not a matter of changing the 
emigres' ideology: Our views can differ; that will not prevent 
us from working with all Cubans who, regardless of where they 
may be, desire the best for Cuba, he said. 
  Fiallo, meanwhile, noted that -- although he did not arrive 
at there thinking this way -- the seminars on participative 
democracy are also a means of preparing for the "nation and 
immigration" conference scheduled for April by the authorities 
and approximately 200 members of the Cuban community abroad. 
  This effort, he said, proves that the Cuban people can 
sustain civilized conversations that begin with respect and end 
cordially and this, regardless of the topic, will foster a 
climate of rapprochement. 
  In the opinion of Professor Amalio Fiallo, director of the 
Pro- Man Society of Caracas [Sociedad Prohombre de Caracas], a 
process of understanding is taking place between Cubans on the 
island and abroad which is viewed positively by both sides. 
  In his opinion, nevertheless, it is necessary to separate 
the 
majority of Cubans from a small group of radical exiles who 
control the news media and are now intensifying their attacks in 
view of the April conference. 
  Another participant in the conversation was Jerold Moser, 
the 
representative in Venezuela and the Caribbean of the Hans Seidel 
Foundation of Bavaria, Germany, the organization that is 
financing the seminars on participative democracy in Cuba as it 
previously did in Madrid, Puerto Rico, Miami, New York, and 
other U.S. cities. 
  Moser explained to PRENSA LATINA that his institution 
sponsors programs in favor of dialogue and international 
encounters and that he supports the plan presented by Fiallo, 
which he views as a good example for the world, although it will 
be carried out among Cubans.

  [Text] Havana, 6 Mar (PL) -- The Cuban weekly JUVENTUD 
REBELDE today urged the U.S. Government to earmark funds for the 
protection of individuals who are fleeing repression in Haiti 
instead of financing the invention of politically persecuted 
people in Cuba. 
  JUVENTUD REBELDE expressed its views on the subject when 
commenting on the 3 March disclosure of a secret official U.S. 
report recognizing the nonexistence of solid cases of human 
rights violations in Cuba. 
  The document, signed by Joseph Sullivan, chief of the U.S. 
Interests Section in Havana, was prominently published by 
JUVENTUD REBELDE under the title, Top Secret (Muy Secreto). 
[title given in English followed by editorial note in Spanish]. 
  The U.S. report, the weekly publication notes, "is 
irrefutable evidence not only of the lies and hoaxes invented 
and promoted against the Cuban revolution, but also -- even 
though it comes form our enemies -- of the absolute probity that 
has always characterized us." 
  Although we did everything possible to work with human 
rights 
groups to obtain more solid cases, most of the interviews did 
not produce any conclusive cases, the official U.S. document 
states. 
  For the past 35 years Cuba has reiterated that there have 
been no cases of murder, torture, or missing persons in our 
country, and no one can deny that, JUVENTUD REBELDE contends. 
  It also protests the fact that based on fabrications of this 
nature and statements by small groups that have made a business 
out of the alleged defense of human rights in Cuba, the United 
States is trying to condemn Cuba at the UN Human Rights 
Commission for violating those rights. 
  How do the governments that support Washington's position at 
the United Nations feel now that U.S. officials themselves have 
admitted in secret reports the falsity of their arguments, the 
Cuban weekly asks. 
  JUVENTUD REBELDE also stresses the fact that the document 
also recognizes the fraudulent nature of many actions carried 
out by groups that claim to defend human rights here, whose 
leaders "make money at the expense of a program for refugees 
that has no justification." 
  During the past few months, there have been frequent reports 
of fraudulent requests from activists and paid testimonies by 
human rights leaders, the U.S. document admitted in reference to 
the procedures followed to request asylum in the United States.

  [Text] Havana, 9 Mar (PL) -- Today, a Cuban general 
disclosed unpublished aspects of CIA activities against his 
country, while he hailed the work of state security 
organizations and the people's support, which frustrated those 
plans. 
  General Fabian Escalante, from the Interior Ministry, spoke 
at the Union of Cuban Journalists' (UPEC) headquarters to 
reporters from all media at the ceremony launching his book: 
"Cuba: The CIA's Secret War," [Cuba: La Guerra Secreta de la CIA] 
  The event was part of a program organized by UPEC 
celebrating 
Cuban press day. The program will conclude on 14 March by 
honoring the 26 March anniversary of state security 
organizations. 
  The book discloses the background to a series of events that 
took place starting with the triumph of the Revolution in 1959 
and before the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961. 
  A long chain of conspiracies, assassination attempts against 
Cuban President Fidel Castro and other revolutionary leaders, 
the preparation of the previously mentioned Bay of Pigs 
invasion, as well as other, lesser known events, are detailed by 
the author. This has been based on declassified documents and 
statements by participants and witnesses. 
  During his conversation with reporters, Escalante, who 
joined 
the Cuban Interior Ministry in 1960, made reference to CIA and 
other U.S. Special Service efforts to obstruct the profound 
Cuban political process, initially, and then later to destroy it. 
  A significant number of anecdotes on the struggle carried 
out 
by the nation's newly born security apparatus, in that early 
period, to resist and beat Washington's plans were related at 
the UPEC event. 
  At the conclusion of his presentation, Gen. Escalante 
explained to PRENSA LATINA, in brief statements, that only 
because of the massive participation of the Cuban people were 
they able to win such an unequal confrontation. 
  If the people had not been on the side of the Revolution, he 
added, this would not have been possible, taking into account 
the enemy's enormous resources. 
  Escalante indicated that in his opinion, Cuba's true history 
is the history written by the people in their daily struggle and 
in the defense of a nation faced with foreign aggression.

  [Text] Havana, 1 Mar (PL) -- Jose Felipe Machado, governor 
of Venezuela's Cojedes State who is winding up a six-day trip to 
Cuba, today in Havana signed letters of intent with Cuban 
authorities for public health, sports, and construction projects. 
  Machado also signed a document whereby Cojedes State and 
Havana's Rancho Boyeros Municipality became twin cities. 
  The visitor expressed satisfaction with signing, with Cuban 
Vice Health Minister Jorge Antelo, an agreement whereby the 
Cuban family doctor experience will be implemented in Cojedes. 
  This agreement also makes provisions for the exchange of 
bilateral graduate students, scholarships in the field of 
health, advice on hospital matters, and the treatment of 
patients from Cojedes at specialized centers in Cuba. 
  In the area of sports, Cuba will act as an adviser through 
trainers and technicians, while in the area of construction 
there are plans to build low-cost housing in Cojedes based on a 
project developed on the island. 
  The governor said the letters of intent constitute sources 
of 
mutual aid that facilitate regional unity, and he thanked his 
hosts for their hospitality and cooperation throughout his visit. 
  The Venezuelan delegation is made up of Leandro Sosa, 
secretary general of [Cojedes State] government; Filinto Duran, 
adviser and assistant dean of the Latin American University; 
Ramon Rodriguez, head of the Sports Federation; Alfredo Paez, 
president of the Housing Institute, and other well-known figures 
as well. 
  On 26 February Machado was declared an Illustrious Visitor 
of 
Havana by Mayor Pedro Chavez. 
  The delegation toured health centers, the National Sports 
Institute, the Latin American Stadium, the Old Havana Historical 
Center, which UNESCO has declared the cultural property of 
humanity, and other interesting sites. 
  Cojedes State, which is primarily a cattle-raising region, 
has an area of 14,800 km, a population of over 200,000 and its 
capital, San Carlos, is located approximately 260 km southwest 
of Caracas.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina traveled to 
Indonesia today, the first stop of a 21-day tour through seven 
south Asian countries, with hopes of expanding trade. 
  Robaina and accompanying delegation will also visit India, 
Malaysia, Myanmar (formerly Burma), Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia, 
as reported during a news conference at Jose Marti Airport 
minutes before takeoff today. 
  The foreign minister said one of the purposes of the trip is 
to learn of the economic results that are being achieved in many 
of these countries. 
  We also intend to explain the goal of our project, bearing 
in 
mind the difficult situation we are facing, he said. 
  There is not only curiosity in the Asian nations about what 
we are doing, but we are also very interested in finding out 
what they are doing, because Cuba not only has to explain its 
situation but has to listen as well, the Cuban minister said. 
  He also said in addition to its needs, Cuba has useful 
things 
to share with other countries. 
  He explained he does not intend to sign specific economic 
agreements, because the fundamental mission is to expand and 
open up opportunities for cooperation. 
  Among the topics to be discussed with the different 
governments are the role that can be played by the nonaligned 
nations, especially during its next foreign ministers conference 
scheduled to take place in Cairo in late May. 
  In addition, the Cuban foreign minister denied press reports 
of an alleged expulsion of Cuban diplomats from Canada, and he 
said the island will not close down its mission in that country; 
"there will only be a rotation of personnel working there." 
  He also announced Luis Suarez, America Research Center 
director, will attend the swearing-in ceremony of the new 
Chilean president, Eduardo Frei. 
  The Chilean authorities did not send an invitation to the 
Cuban Government and instead sent it to four individuals, among 
them Suarez. 
  Asked about the meeting scheduled to be held in April 
between 
Cuban authorities and the exiled community abroad, he said a 
list of participants, which will be publicized during the next 
few weeks, is being drafted. 
  In this regard, he recited the exclusion of those whose 
attitude does not correspond with the "parameters of 
nonaggression and nonhysteria." "Those who did not even expect 
an invitation and have already replied (negatively)" will be 
excluded. 
  As for the latter, he said "if they replied without being 
invited, it is because they understand the message is not for 
them." 
  The Cuban Government announced recently a Nation and 
Emigration Conference scheduled for 22, 23, and 24 April, during 
which Cuban emigrants interested in the normalization of ties 
with the country will participate. 
  Concerning a possible visit to Spain, he said it will 
possibly occur in May but that a reply from the Spanish Foreign 
Ministry was needed. 
  Robaina visited the PRC in June 1993, and he visited eight 
Caribbean countries in late November. He also visited Mexico 
and Colombia. 
  The Cuban foreign minister also toured five African 
countries 
in January of this year.

<F P=106> [Report by Javier Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 5 Mar (PL) -- French ambassador to Cuba Jean 
Raphael Dufour said today in this capital relations between the 
two countries have entered a new and important phase through 
positive development. 
  In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Dufour has said the 
strengthening of bilateral relations constitutes a reply to 
Cuban efforts to broaden, more each day, the ties uniting this 
Caribbean nation with the rest of the world, particularly with 
the European Union. 
  Dufour recalled the French delegations that recently visited 
Cuba were very impressed with the Cuban people's efforts to 
overcome their current difficulties. 
  Our representatives saw how Cubans are working to find 
solutions by using imagination with knowledge. When they 
returned to Paris, they reported they found a very active people 
ready to work with us, the ambassador has added. 
  After saying the 35 businessmen who accompanied the first 
mission had a similar reaction, Dufour said all of this 
contributes to a positive evolution of the negotiations. 
  He said the French Government has guaranteed a $120-million 
credit by which Cuba can acquire basic products for industries 
and food. He added both countries must work at materializing a 
profound development of commercial relations and overcoming 
financial difficulties. 
  Dufour has said he favors finding solutions for investing in 
Cuba so that Cuba can obtain resources and credits to be 
invested in tourism and to improve the economy. 
  It will be necessary to find solutions via the Bank of Paris 
to grant Cuba the credit it needs. Naturally, via efforts from 
both sides, we will be able to sort this obstacle, Dufour said 
during the interview. 
  Dufour stressed the importance of Cuba's current relations 
with Europe and the place the European Continent occupies in the 
country's investments and trade, with France in an outstanding 
position, along with Spain, Germany, Italy, the U.K., and the 
Netherlands. 
  We must help Cuba overcome its economic difficulties and 
facilitate its full development.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Cuban economic developments monitored through 8 March. 
  The country's gross income from tourism in 1993 was $720 
million, 30 percent more than in 1992, according to Osmany 
Cienfuegos, Council of Ministers vice president. Cienfuegos has 
added the government expects to earn approximately $1 billion 
this year from tourism, considered one of the strategic sectors 
that helps the country overcome the difficult economic situation 
it has been facing for the past three years. He has said by 
1996 income from tourism will surpass sugar sales, the country's 
main source of foreign exchange, and that in the near future, 
tourism will be the second most important sector in Cuban 
foreign trade, after the medical-pharmaceutical and 
biotechnological industry. (Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 
1856 GMT 3 Mar 94) 
  Sergio Corrieri, president of the Cuban Institute of 
Friendship with the Peoples [Icap], a nongovernmental 
organization, has reported Icap received about $50 million in 
donations from friends of 72 countries in 1993. The donations 
consisted of medicines, school supplies, powdered milk, and 
others, Corrieri has told the weekly GRANMA. (Havana PRENSA

  [Text] Answering a LA NACION inquiry on 8 March, Argentine 
Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella stated that the 
Foreign Ministry has taken no action leading to the sale of 
cannons and ammunition to the former Yugoslavia. 
  Petrella emphasized this statement by reminding the 
journalist that the United Nations has expressly banned the sale 
of arms to the currently conflict-torn former Yugoslavia. 
  According to the DYN news agency, the United Nations 
"thwarted a deal through which Argentina would sell arms to 
Liberia, although the shipment's final destination was to be one 
of the countries of the former Yugoslavia." 
  The DYN report added: "According to information on hand, the 
Foreign Ministry cleared the initial request and granted the 
appropriate approval for the deal. The Defense Ministry is no 
doubt involved as well." 
  According to DYN: "Official sources acknowledged only that 
Liberia was the intended destination of the arms and that the 
United Nations objected to the sale; however, the request for 
information that Radical Civic Union legislators submitted to 
Congress made it obvious that the deal had aroused strong 
suspicions." 
  Argentine Defense Minister Oscar Camilion told DYN it is 
impossible to sell arms to the former Yugoslavia because there 
is a UN embargo on such deals.

  [Text] An emergency law presented to Congress by Treasury 
Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez was approved this evening after 
Congress debated it for three hours in a bicameral session. The 
only thing that remains now is for the legislative branch to 
send the document to the executive for confirmation. 
  In a bicameral session, Congress approved a law dealing with 
the nation's financial crisis. MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] 
Deputy Walter Marquez, who has closely followed the Banco Latino 
case, as president of the commission investigating the case, 
gave his opinion on this law: 
  [Begin Marquez recording] The most important points approved 
guarantee bank deposit insurance from 1 to 4 million bolivares 
and the appointment of representatives for the depositors to the 
Intervention Board. Meanwhile, the Intervention Board is 
authorized to pay senior citizens over 60 and people who are in 
a difficult economic situation enough to cover their daily 
expenses. Likewise, the mechanisms to handle financial 
emergencies were established, and in the same manner, mechanisms 
were set up to obtain temporary financial aid. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Berenice Gomez Velasquez] </F>
  [Text] Following the executive branch's announcement that 
the national budget will be reduced 10 percent, the Armed Forces 
has reduced its budget for this fiscal year by at least 6 
billion bolivares. Very well-informed military sources made this 
announcement because no official information is available at the 
ministry. 
  The estimated budget reductions are as follows: Army: 17 
percent, which is equivalent to approximately 3 billion 
bolivares; Navy: 11 percent, which is equivalent to about 700 
million bolivares; Venezuelan Air Force: 7 percent, which is 
equivalent to 400 million bolivares; and Armed Forces of 
National Cooperation: 16 percent, which is equivalent to about 
2.4 billion bolivares. 
  Reports indicate that Rear Admiral Panayotis Francis Sanchez 
was the officer tasked with making the estimated reductions, but 
it was not explained why, in certain cases, the reductions were 
higher than the recommended 10 percent. There is hope the 
figures will be reduced somewhat due to the ongoing war against 
narcoguerrillas, Colombian brigands, and Brazilian gold 
prospectors on the Brazilian- Colombian border, especially when 
the National Armed Forces is being urged to comply with its 
duties of providing protection and security in areas that are so 
far away that they are nearly inaccessible and where millions 
are spent in fuel flying and navigating for hours. 
  This reduction will affect the four components of the 
military forces. It will supposedly affect their operation as 
little as possible and funds for gasoline, food, supplies, and 
preventive and operational maintenance programs will be left 
untouched. Reports indicate there are no plans for acquisitions 
this year. There is no indication whether allocations to buy 
artwork, pay bonuses and representational expenses, remodel 
offices, maintain and remodel the "El Cielo" ministerial 
residence and the main residences and summer residences of the 
general commanders, and pay the salaries of household personnel 
at these residences will be reduced or eliminated. 
  There is also no indication whether there will be reductions 
in allocations for military health, especially when military 
hospitals throughout the country are facing problems of scarcity 
and private medical care is so expensive. No explanation was 
given on whether the reduction will affect the execution of the 
main maintenance contract for missile frigates hulls, which was 
approved and signed by the Navy, Congefan [National Armed Forces 
Comptroller General's Office], and the national Attorney 
General's Office. 
  It is possible the National Guard [GN] will be the most 
affected because the "secret funds," which are mostly used to 
cover salaries and to partly pay for intelligence work, were 
reduced. Therefore, some GN training schools will be closed to 
avoid expenses because there will not be enough funds to pay for 
new salaries. It is hoped the GN budget reduction will be 
reconsidered and reduced to at least one fourth of what was 
proposed so as not to affect the GN training.

  [Text] Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez Frias, leader of the 
failed 4 February 1992 military coup, in a letter he sent to 
this newspaper yesterday, explained he is willing to resign from 
the National Armed Forces [FAN] 24 hours after being released. 
  The commander, who is staying at the Military Hospital, said 
the situation following statements by the president have 
prompted his decision. In a speech the president of the 
Republic has said the only obstacle that can keep an officer or 
noncommissioned officer from returning to active duty in the FAN 
is his political involvement. 
  He has admitted of the many officers and NCOs of the 4 
February uprising still in prison, "only Hugo Chavez Frias has 
assumed a permanent and critical political attitude, in his 
attempt to respond to the expectations of the people who woke up 
and stood on their feet that night, while all the other officers 
and NCOs have remained almost completely silent." 
  He accepts responsibility for the position publicly adopted 
by the 200 Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement and accepts 
whatever punishment that may result from such statements. 
  Following the reasons given by the commander in chief, I 
hereby state to my countrymen I will physically leave the Army 
and hang up my uniform 24 hours after my release, if this should 
occur." [no opening quotation mark as published] 
<H5>  The Conditions </H5>
  Commander Chavez states in his document that to request his 
resignation the following specific conditions must be met: 
  1. Freedom and a return to active duty of ALL [previous 
word published in uppercase] officers, NCOs, and subordinate 
soldiers still imprisoned for the 4 February and 27 November 
events, provided this is their wish.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 8 
March. 
  A study by Fogade (Deposit Guarantee Fund) indicates that it 
provides an average of 11 to 12 billion bolivares every day to 
the Construccion, Maracaibo, Latino, La Guaira, Metropolitano, 
and Sociedad Financiera Fiveca banking institutions. Already, 
Fogade has provided these banks sums in excess of 300 billion 
bolivares. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 2 Mar 94 p E-11) 
  The Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) was able to sell all its 
zero-coupon bonds, worth 25 billion (no currency specified), 
thereby, revealing the liquidity level of the market. The fact 
that all the bonds were sold shows that the country is beginning 
to solve the national financial crisis. Only the seven banks 
that have asked for financial assistance continue to have 
liquidity problems. (Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 3 Mar 94 p 16) 
  In February, BCV international reserves dropped to $11.249 
billion and the consumer price index went up 1.9 percent, 
official news agency VENPRES reported. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 
1610 GMT 3 Mar 94) 
  Swedish Ambassador in Venezuela Peter Landelius has stated 
that bilateral trade between his country and Venezuela totals 
over $200 million a year. (Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 4 Mar 94 
p 7) 
  Venezuelan petroleum expenses increased 56.669 billion 
bolivares as a result of the currency being devaluated. The 
foreign exchange rate, which was 69.29 bolivares per dollar in 
1992, increased to 92 bolivares per dollar in 1993. In its 
annual report, the Energy and Mines Ministry reported that oil 
export revenues in 1993 totaled 1,027,947,000,000 bolivares, 
which represents an increase of 257.36 billion bolivares over 
1992, which totaled 770.911 billion bolivares. The report also 
states that the total amount of oil exports in 1993 reached 2.14 
million barrels per day, of which 69.59 percent represents crude 
oil and 30.41 percent, oil by-products. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA 
ECONOMIA in Spanish 4 Mar 94) 
  Carlos Garcia, executive director of the 
Colombian-Venezuelan 
Integration Chamber, has reported that trade exchanges between 
the two countries reached $1.6 billion in 1993. This increase of 
about 62 percent over 1992 favored Venezuela's trade balance by 
$197 million. The trade balance favored Colombia in 1992 by $126 
million. Private Venezuelan investments in Colombia totaled $27 
million and private Colombian investments in Venezuela totaled 
$6 million. (Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 7 Mar 94 p 24)

<F P=106> [Interview with Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu by </F>
unidentified reporter, "upon his arrival in Buenos Aires 
accompanied by Uruguayan Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas for 
a Mercosur, Common Market of the South, meeting;" date not given] 
  [Text] [LA PRENSA] Minister Abreu, what are your 
expectations for this Mercosur meeting? 
  [Abreu] The objective of this meeting is to evaluate matters 
of importance for the integration of the four Mercosur 
countries. One of the more significant matters is the progress 
of the technical studies on the common external tariff. Another 
very important topic is a Brazilian proposal to create a 
free-trade zone in South America. We will evaluate those 
topics. Even though this meeting is not being held to meet any 
formally established deadline, we can also evaluate the progress 
made in all the integration processes. 
  [LA PRENSA] What points are creating most disagreement among 
Mercosur members? 
  [Abreu] The Treaty of Asuncion divides the integration 
process into three major parts: The commercial liberalization 
program, which is being implemented in close compliance with the 
agreed terms and deadlines; the common external tariff is also 
on schedule, although a technical definition is still pending -- 
one of the reasons for this meeting is to evaluate studies on 
this last point. A third controversial point refers to 
macroeconomic policies and the consolidation of the integration 
process with liberalization in four areas: goods, services, 
capital, and labor. This last point is held up by the 
asymmetries of the four countries. It will undoubtedly be 
evaluated to see what adjustments and political decisions can be 
introduced to fulfill the terms of the treaty. 
  [LA PRENSA] Among the four countries there are problems like 
the harmonization of the macroeconomic policies and the common 
external tariff. Do you think it will be possible to agree on a 
common external tariff by June? 
  [Abreu] There are disagreements but it should also be noted 
that we have complied with the commercial liberalization 
deadlines. This is a really important matter because 82 percent 
of tariff reductions have already been accomplished and the 
number of exceptions has dropped, as was expected. External 
tariff levels are now being studied, as I was telling you, and 
it should be noted that a consensus has already been reached on 
85 percent of the cases to which the common tariff applies. 
There are pending decisions on fields that can be considered 
sensitive, in petrochemicals, informatics, and capital goods. 
We believe by June we will have a technical and political 
decision on the work and on the fulfillment of deadlines on this 
particular point. 
  [LA PRENSA] What will be the Uruguayan position with respect 
to Mexico? 
  [Abreu] Uruguay will adopt a very clear position. We want an 
additional regulation for Article 44 of the LAIA [Latin American 
Integration Association] -- which regulates LAIA's concessions 
on agreements reached with third parties -- not just in the case 
of Mexico but for all those countries that want to establish 
relations with nations outside LAIA. We want to be sufficiently 
realistic, from a political viewpoint, in order to acknowledge 
this situation. From the legal viewpoint we propose providing an 
appropriate framework for integration under an umbrella that 
also includes LAIA. 
  [LA PRENSA] Does Uruguay want to relieve Mexico from the 
commitments it assumed with LAIA? 
  [Abreu] This does not apply just to Mexico. It is an 
additional regulation for countries that grant concessions to 
third countries outside LAIA and which engage in negotiations 
with their partners to compensate for the commercial distortions 
that may result from agreements signed in the region. It is an 
additional juridical document that will, or may, apply to those 
countries which, like Mexico, make deals with countries outside 
the region.

  [Text] A society of friendship with Cuba was recently 
created in Russia. One of the objectives of this society is to 
seek the lifting of the U.S. blockade against Cuba and the 
development of ties between the Russian and Cuban peoples. 
  In remarks to PRENSA LATINA, (Anatoliy Burlov), vice 
president of the organization, said that the legal registration 
of this society is to promote rapprochement between the two 
nations in important areas such as culture, tourism, and the 
probable creation of joint ventures. (Burlov) said that this new 
society headed by cosmonaut (Vladimir Shatalov) stems from the 
principles of the previous organization founded in 1964 by Yuri 
Gagarin. 
  According to (Shatalov), the main objective of this society 
is to group the true friends of Cuba for the purpose of 
defending bilateral cooperation and the interests of the two 
nations.

  [Text] For the first time, the Hispasat satellite signal 
has been received in Cuba, on educational television, fulfilling 
one of the agreements of the Ibero-American Summit. This has 
been achieved as the result of the competent, dedicated work of 
the expert satellite and optical-link researchers at the Jose 
Antonio Echeverria Superior Polytechnical School in Havana City. 
  A relevant fact was that at the first interactive conference 
in February, outstanding experts of the Medical Sciences 
Institute received a live satellite signal, enabling them to 
observe three top scientific-level surgeries. 
  During the Hispasat satellite transmissions, a doctor 
observing one of the complex surgeries was able to answer 
questions on the patient's health condition.

  [Text] A meeting on anti-aircraft defense was held at unit 
no. 4790 of the Western Army, the best of its kind in Cuba. The 
purpose of the meeting was to analyze the new types of 
preparation for command and control elements under conditions of 
the special period. Furthermore, they analyzed the action to be 
taken by anti-aircraft defense regiments to repel air strikes 
while under a military blockade, and to resist systematic 
demoralization [desgaste sistematico] efforts. The [words 
indistinct] localization and pursuit of enemy targets, and the 
preparation of the reserves and Territorial Troops Militia were 
other issues discussed in this important meeting. Lieutenant 
Colonel Enrique Garces Montesino highlights the reasons this 
unit was selected as the site for the meeting. 
  [Begin Garces recording] During 1991, 1992, and 1993, this 
regiment achieved the distinction of being the best 
anti-aircraft defense regiment because of the results obtained 
in combat training and political preparation, which was 
demonstrated during an inspection carried out by the Ministry of 
the Revolutionary Armed Forces in the western territory in 1993. 
It was rated good, and superior. It was also selected because of 
its achievements in the food program, conservation and 
protection of equipment and armaments, and in improvement of its 
personnel's living conditions. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Aracely Careaga, vice president of the </F>
National Commission for Attention and Social Prevention by Mirta 
Rodriguez Calderon; date and place not given; first 5 paragraphs 
are BOHEMIA's introduction] 
  [Text] The rigor with which she approaches her work and the 
meticulousness that characterizes almost every aspect of her 
conduct make Aracely Careaga, vice president of the National 
Commission for Attention and Social Prevention (CNPAS), one of 
those people who are always seen to be striving toward a goal, 
dedicated to getting a handle on the future, committed to 
tomorrow. 
  Careaga, who is in charge of one of the most sensitive and 
controversial programs of our time, does not make small talk 
easily and is not very articulate when it comes to casual 
conversation; it is impossible to imagine her engaging in 
hallway gossip. Her personality reflects the rough life in the 
mining town where she grew up, Matahambre, but her bright eyes 
also occasionally reveal a natural exuberance and a joie 
de vivre. 
  Perhaps that is why, whenever she talks at a gathering, 
whenever she visits provinces and municipalities to make 
criticisms here and to call for changes there, and whenever she 
gets excited about a project that is coming along nicely and 
people who are making improvements, I think back to when she 
headed that first group of women who, in the 1970's, went to 
Angola to lend a hand and to put their lives on the line for 
internationalism. She would go on to fulfill other missions 
there. 
  First she was a telephone official, then a leader of the 
Federation of Cuban Women (FMC), then a Party official, then 
back to the Federation, then a deputy to the National Assembly 
for a while. Aracely Careaga had a close relationship with Vilma 
Espin for many years, during the times (separated by nearly 
three five-year periods) when social work attained institutional 
status. 
  Originally a teacher, she earned a university degree in 
social sciences. The vice president of the CNPAS agreed to 
answer questions for BOHEMIA to shed light on social issues that 
have been steeped in controversy, provoking many discussions 
these days: Will theft and corruption continue to run rampant, 
or will decent people who are inspired by the revolution finally 
prevail? 
<H5>  Urgent Action </H5>
  [Rodriguez Calderon] Many people believe that crimes against 
the economy, the rise of the black market, unofficial trading, 
and theft of all kinds are growing and multiplying, encouraged 
by the general atmosphere of indolence and permissiveness. How 
does the vice president of the CNPAS react to these opinions, 
which are obviously based on views of reality? 
  [Careaga] It is clear that these crimes, negative acts and 
behaviors, thefts and diversion of resources have arisen out of 
the lack of control and enforcement, and the indolence of those 
who are responsible for the people's property. All of that, plus 
the presence of unscrupulous individuals who take advantage of 
our plight to line their own pockets. 
  There is no doubt that many of the items sold for exorbitant 
prices on the black market have been taken from state units, 
enterprises, and warehouses that are feeding that market. 
  The most serious repercussions of theft are not economic but 
ideological, because the first ones to be corrupted by the 
people involved in that are their families. The social cost of 
these acts is so high that, in my opinion, if there is no 
authority, we must seek the authority to take action against 
them, and do it right away. I think we must act from the top 
down, and I emphasize that phrase because we must start from the 
top. We must respond forcefully: enforce existing state control 
mechanisms and implement new ones if those do not work. 
  We must impose the appropriate penalties on officials and 
administrators who are unable to account for the resources 
entrusted to them, and most importantly, it is necessary that 
the fight against economic crime in the workplace be waged by 
the masses, to counter certain attitudes of acquiescence and 
complicity with a strong offensive. 
  [Rodriguez Calderon] For several years, since they were 
restructured in 1986, the Social Prevention Commissions have 
worked, in some provinces more than others, to save people, to 
put those who have committed crimes and taken the wrong path 
back on the right track. Yet crime is on the rise, and there are 
more and more criminals. In view of that fact, do you and your 
associates have doubts about the effectiveness of the work of 
the CPAS? What is your assessment of this situation? 
  [Careaga] To understand certain problems, the rise in crimes 
such as theft and larceny, it is necessary to begin with an 
analysis of the complex situation we live in, under the 
conditions of the special period, the restrictions and shortages 
of all kinds that we face. That causes an increase in crime and 
in the number of offenders. 
  At times like this, when our people are undoubtedly 
responding positively, there are some who choose the easiest 
path, who twist and corrupt, who reject honest work and profit 
at the expense of those who do work and build. 
  These developments should not lead us to the erroneous and 
subjective conclusion that the political, preventive, and social 
work carried out by the commissions as well as other agencies 
and organizations in our society are not necessary or effective. 
Examples abound of individuals who once chose the wrong path but 
have been given a chance, have mended their ways, and are now 
useful citizens in society. 
  I think that one very encouraging sign we can point to, in 
contrast to those undesirable realities, is the fact that there 
is very little juvenile delinquency, and the proportion of 
juveniles among offenders in general is steadily decreasing. 
<H5>  Strategies to Combat Alcoholism </H5>
  [Rodriguez Calderon] Tell me some good news. Give me some 
examples of the CPAS's primary objectives for the near future 
.... 
  [Careaga] There is a lot of good news all over the place; in 
all provinces, we are working enthusiastically on our greatest 
problems. The alcoholism program, for example, is a strategy 
that is well under way. 
  Of course, everyone knows that this is no easy task, 
especially in some parts of the country, such as the eastern 
provinces, where alcoholism is prevalent. We must put a stop to 
the trend we are seeing among young people, who drink for the 
sake of drinking, and who think they have to drink to have fun. 
We must research this phenomenon further, but studies that have 
already been done show that the vast majority of alcoholics 
started young, were youthful drinkers. 
  I am very hopeful about the work that is being done, that 
has 
already begun, in education. Social prevention must begin in 
school and continue from there. 
  There are examples of successful projects in Villa Clara, in 
encouraging people to spend their free time with their families 
and engage in recreation with them: in Sagua, in Caibarien, in 
Placetas.... In Las Tunas, efforts to treat and rehabilitate 
individuals with deviant, antisocial, or criminal behavior have 
been outstanding; terrific work is being done there. In 
Matanzas, valuable experience has been gained in work with 
youngsters. I could enumerate, one by one, important and 
far-reaching projects that are being carried out in practically 
every province.... 
<H5>  People Come First </H5>
  [Rodriguez Calderon] You, personally, in your work, see the 
gloomiest side of life, where people suffer, commit crimes, 
become alcoholics, are deprived, commit suicide, or lose some of 
their humanity. How do you, as a woman, deal with these 
situations? How do you maintain your optimism so that you can go 
on living? What are the positive aspects of doing this kind of 
job? 
  [Careaga] I face it without pessimism, and with a great deal 
of objectivity. I am convinced that our work is necessary, 
because we are helping to save a misguided child or teenager, to 
find the seed of improper behavior and eliminate it before it 
grows into a crime, to extend a hand and give a second chance to 
someone who made a mistake and is willing to change. But I am 
also aware that there are people who are not capable of being 
guided, trained, educated, or reformed so that they can be put 
on the right track. 
  It is true that we work on the gloomy side of life, but that 
does not discourage me or undermine our optimism. Because we 
feel rewarded when teenagers or youngsters with problem behavior 
or criminal activity are saved by the proper help and attention, 
and today are workers or students; some of them have fulfilled 
internationalist missions. And above all, because we have 
children and young people who fill us with pride. 
  [Rodriguez Calderon] Do you think our society is healthy? 
Explain your opinion. 
  [Careaga] Without any hesitation whatsoever, I can say that 
ours is one of the healthiest societies in the world. Because we 
can be proud of the fact that we have no street urchins or child 
prostitution or pornography; no children are kidnapped to become 
involuntary organ donors; there is no drug addiction, begging, 
or unemployment; we do not have children who have no school to 
go to, or people who die for lack of medical care. 
  Moreover, we have young people who go to school, work, and 
make contributions to science; who spend part of their vacation 
time doing volunteer work for the food plan. Ours is a dignified 
and honorable society, a society, in short, where social justice 
prevails, and where people come first.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Excerpts] The National Front for Change and Democracy, 
FNCD, has taken a stand against the parliamentary plan. The 
FNCD says it stands by its 16 February proposal, which is a 
realistic compromise that can get the country out of the 
deadlock. Daly Valet had a talk with Senator Turneb Delpe and 
filed this report: 
  [Begin recording] [Valet] The FNCD is experiencing a bad 
moment, a moment when there is so much confusion that FNCD 
grassroots organizations and deputies who were close to the 
front want to distance themselves from the FNCD. This confusion 
has prevailed within the FNCD since the National Congress of 
Democratic Movements [Conacom] deputies and leader [Victor 
Benoit, also an FNCD spokesman] decided to support a 
parliamentary plan for resolving the crisis. 
  Sen. Delpe, an FNCD spokesman, broke silence to say that 
they 
[not further identified] will solve all the problems being faced 
by the FNCD. As for the parliamentary plan, Delpe says it is 
dangerous. He says it is bad tactics for the parliamentarians to 
engage in the negotiations so directly as to propose a plan for 
resolving the crisis. 
  [Delpe] I think that, after the Washington agreement and the 
Villa d'Accueil agreement, the Haitian parliament should have 
drawn conclusions, learned a lesson, from the experience and not 
involved itself again in any direct negotiations. Besides, now 
there is the Governors Island agreement, which has defined the 
role the parliament must play in the crisis: that is, pass the 
laws ensuing from the Governors Island agreement. 
  I believe it would be in the interest of the parliament to 
set limits for itself so that it does not bear the brunt of this 
crisis once again. If things are tangled, I believe the only 
step the parliament should take now is to find a way to prompt 
the two protagonists to shoulder their responsibilities to 
disentangle the country. [passage omitted] 
  [Valet] Evans Paul and Turneb Delpe, two of the FNCD's 
[three] spokesmen, have signed a press release asking the 
parliament to take President Aristide's position into 
consideration -- otherwise there will be no compromise, they 
said. 
  As regards the position of Conacom, which has said it 
supports the parliamentary plan, Sen. Delpe says Conacom is an 
autonomous party within the FNCD and has the right to take its 
own position in an autonomous way. According to FNCD spokesman 
Delpe then, Conacom's position is not the FNCD's. [passage 
omitted] 
  Thus, through two of its spokesmen, Evans Paul and Turneb 
Delpe, the FNCD has reiterated its determination to see 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide return to Haiti. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Senator Osny Eugene says he has discovered 
several irregularities in the files of the Haitian Senate's 
accounting department. Osny Eugene, quaestor of the office 
presided over by Bernard Sansaricq, says he is setting the 
institution in order. 
  [Begin Eugene recording] ...is that all those sections 
were enclosed in a big accounting department. Well, there are a 
number of irregularities that they [not further identified] will 
be unable to discover because the accountant was both the 
person in charge of spending the money and the bursar. 
  I must tell you that a partial audit led us to realize 
that from May to December there were at least four persons -- 
including two who have died and two others who were dismissed -- 
for whom paychecks continued to be written. We are just now 
setting things in order. We do not intend to harm anybody. We do 
not intend to dismiss anybody but we are setting things in 
order, even if it does mean that in the near future we will 
(?have to) convert some employees, by putting them in the right 
place. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Cloudy skies and threats of a storm appear in the 
Senate of the Republic. The political forecast does not predict 
any break in the clouds. With two presidents for one office, it 
is a real predetermined battle that the two groups of senators, 
including those elected on 18 January, are engaged in for 
control of the office. Both teams confront each other on the air 
with public accusations. 
  On 9 March, the office of Senator Sansaricq made a point of 
bringing the battle into the realm of management by the other 
president, Firmin Jean-Louis, and Quaestor Larosiliere. 
Referring to some preliminary results of an audit in progress on 
Jean-Louis' management, Bernard Sansaricq is already accusing 
these colleagues of embezzlement, and is threatening to engage 
Justice. 
  [Begin recording] [Sansaricq in Creole] The former office, 
which was acclaimed by Caputo and Despuy, but which was not 
constitutionally elected in compliance with the internal rules 
and the Constitution, from 10 August to 4 February blocked not 
only the Senate of the Republic, but also the country. We have 
found corruption in that administration -- what else can I tell 
you? I will tell you to wait until the audits are over because 
the same thing happened in Brazil, where 20 legislators are in 
prison because of corruption. When the audit is over, you never 
know what can happen. I am determined to take things all the way. 
  [Correspondent Jean-Max Blanc in French] Since you compare 
the current situation within the Senate with the situation in 
Brazil, do you think the Haitian senators will have the same 
fate as the Brazilian senators? 
  [Sansaricq in French] Once we definitively establish proof, 
yes. Once we establish proof, contact our lawyers, and meet with 
the public prosecutor, definitely yes. I am determined to do 
that. [end recording]

  [Text] Firmin Jean-Louis, the president of the first Senate 
office has received the support of the president of the Lower 
Chamber. The president of the Chamber of Deputies has stood in 
favor of the office presided over by Firmin Jean-Louis. Frantz 
Robert Monde, who leads the debates in the Lower Chamber, has 
called the senators to their senses. While reminding them that 
the deputies are willing to work for a solution to the political 
crisis, Frantz Robert Monde invited the senators to join the 
deputies in their position. Frantz Robert Monde is interviewed 
by Edner Jean: 
  [Begin recording] [Monde] The deputies have risen above it. 
If a solution is still being blocked, the fault does not lie 
with the deputies who knew how to rise to the aspirations, 
expectations, of trust vested in them by the people. Despite 
divergences in political and ideological opinion, the deputies 
found a common denominator for the interest of the nation and 
voted strategies for alleviation of the crisis. [In Creole] It 
is an opportunity for me to thank the great men of this Chamber 
of Deputies, while calling on the wisdom of the senators so they 
can understand [back to French] that the others, those who are 
before us, have every interest in widening the gulf within our 
institutions to prove that we Haitians cannot do well. There 
is one office, plus a group of dissident senators. 
  [Jean] Which office is that? 
  [Monde] The office of Mr. Firmin Jean-Louis. I received a 
letter from Ebrane Cadet, who is the first secretary of both 
offices -- he is the only winner. He is first secretary in 
Jean-Louis' office, and first secretary of my colleague, Sen. 
Bernard Sansaricq, with whom I have some deep geographical ties 
and a certain similar political view. 
  I do not think it is up to the president to take a stand on 
this matter, but rather it is up to the assembly, despite the 
fact that I represent the majority in this chamber. I think that 
the 18 January senators have a chance with their plan, which 
provides for a prime minister not from Aristide's ranks, who 
will be a more-or-less neutral prime minister. We will not find 
him. [as heard] However, he will have influence on the 
arbitration committee. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] In Port-au-Prince, a movement led by Attorney 
Mireille Durocher Bertin for the integration of Haitian Women, 
at a ceremony at the El Rancho Hotel, set as its objectives 
establishing a long chain of solidarity among Haitian women of 
all social classes. The organization aims for real integration 
of women into society, promotion of Haitian culture, returning 
self-confidence to women through specific programs to provide 
them access to health, education, and productivity. 
  The inauguration of the Movement for Integration of the 
Haitian Woman [Mouvement pour L'Integration de la Femme 
Haitienne] was marked by a reception at the El Rancho Hotel. On 
this occasion, presentations were made on the situation of women 
in Haiti, their role in the economy and in the family. 
  Researcher Gilbert Valme calls for a new social contract 
between the patriarchal and matriarchal systems, a way, 
according to Mr. Valme, of assuring a better future for Haitian 
children. Other speakers, engineer Ginette Mathurin and Attorney 
Mireille Durocher Bertin, spoke of the role of women in the 
economy, in the peasant environment, and of their legal status.

  [Text] Santiago, 8 Mar (EFE) -- The most important labor 
federation in Chile announced today its opposition to Chile's 
entry into NAFTA, the members of which are the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico. 
  Manuel Bustos, president of the United Labor Federation 
(CUT), said it would be more advantageous for Chile to sign a 
bilateral agreement with the United States, as joining NAFTA 
would imply "the transfer to Chile of all the deficiencies of 
that agreement." 
  The Chilean labor leader said that entrepreneurial interests 
prevail in NAFTA, which is structured in such a way that all 
sanctions for violations of workers' rights "are impossible to 
implement." 
  In the past weeks Chile has been mentioned by U.S. officials 
as the leading candidate for joining NAFTA. 
  The CUT president made these remarks in accompanying 
representatives of the U.S. labor organizations AFL-CIO to a 
meeting with Chilean President-elect Eduardo Frei, who will be 
inaugurated on Friday. 
  The Chilean labor leader said that Frei told them he intends 
to create a tripartite commission, made up of representatives of 
workers, entrepreneurs, and the government, to discuss the 
possibility of joining NAFTA. 
  The representatives of the AFL-CIO, which has a membership 
of 
17 million workers, said they do not support Chile's entry into 
NAFTA because they believe the agreement has inadequate social 
protection clauses. 
  AFL-CIO executive director William Doherty, who heads this 
organization's delegation to the inauguration, said his 
country's workers were hurt by NAFTA because of the low cost of 
Mexican labor and Canadian advanced technology. 
  The U.S. leader said negotiations between Mexico, Canada, 
and 
the United States over NAFTA did not take into account the 
social situation of the three countries, adding that the 
discussion only involved "multinationals interested in 
protecting the capital."

  [Text] There are problems right now at the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal [TSE]. Magistrate Eduardo Colindres has 
confirmed that members of the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front [FMLN] and residents from several 
municipalities in the northern part of the country, especially 
from Chalatenango, are not letting people preparing for the 20 
March elections to enter or leave the building. Dr. Colindres, 
who refused to comment on his current status, only said they are 
preventing TSE personnel from leaving the building. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Dr. Colindres, we 
received a telephone call at the radio station informing us of 
problems at the TSE facility. Apparently the people from the 
northern part of the country have taken hostage the people who 
work at the facility. Please, can you confirm the real situation 
at the tribunal? 
  [Colindres] What happened is that FMLN leaders Mr. 
[Francisco] Jovel and Mr. Gerson Martinez arrived with a group 
of people. I do not know where they came from or how many there 
are because I have been unable to leave. Some were armed when 
they entered the building. They said they would not allow anyone 
from the tribunal to come or go. This apparently relates to four 
municipalities in Chalatenango, namely Arcatao, San Jose Las 
Flores, San Isidro Labrador, and Nueva Trinidad, where the 
Supreme Electoral Tribunal has decided the elections will be 
held at the departmental capital, which means in Chalatenango. 
The decision was made because members of the four municipal 
electoral boards and the Chalatenango Electoral Board requested 
it. I am going to read the text of their request. Because there 
are few residents in San Isidro Labrador Municipality and the 
municipality lacks means of communications, we request 
permission to relocate our voting center to the capital of the 
department so the elections can be held successfully. Based on 
this request and bearing in mind that most of the population 
lives in the capital of the department, the tribunal decided to 
hold the elections in Chalatenango. I understand these people do 
not want anyone here to come or go until they are received. 
  [Reporter] What is your current status inside the tribunal? 
  [Colindres] I would rather not say. The only thing that is 
clear is that they are not allowing anyone to come or go. 
  [Reporter] In addition to the personnel and the magistrates 
who are inside the building, are there other people there who 
may have been filing voting card application forms? 
  [Colindres] Yes, I understand there are people here who do 
not work for the tribunal and who are not being allowed to leave. 
  [Reporter] Have you been able to confirm if the armed people 
are not allowing the people to come or go? 
  [Colindres] Several armed people did in fact enter the 
building, but these people, along with Mr. Jovel and Mr. Gerson 
Martinez, have already left the building. I understand these 
people are still outside. 
  [Reporter] Do you have any idea how many people are outside 
the building? 
  [Colindres] I have not gone outside. I did not want to go 
outside to avoid any unfortunate incident. 
  [Reporter] What is being done at this time to resolve this 
problem? Are any Onusal [UN Observer Mission for El Salvador] 
people there already? 
  [Colindres] There are Onusal people here, and we believe the 
Onusal must intervene to defend the human rights of the 
employees and all the people who are inside the building. [end 
recording]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Salvadoran elections 
scheduled for 20 March 1994. 
  President Alfredo Cristiani asked fellow party members to be 
cautious in view of the results of the latest surveys, which 
show the party that took him to power in first place. He asked 
his party members not to decrease the campaign's intensity 
despite the favorable results shown by the latest surveys. 
Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate for the 
Nationalist Republican Alliance, Arena, was more optimistic, 
however. He said his party will be able to win in the first 
round. (San Salvador Canal Doce Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 3 
Mar 94) 
  Arena Presidential Candidate Armando Calderon Sol promised 
to 
develop tourism and the fishing industry in Usulutan Department 
if he wins the 20 March election. Calderon made the statement in 
Jiquilisco, located 90 km from the capital, on 6 March. (San 
Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 7 Mar 94 p 5) 
  At least three recently created political parties run the 
risk of disappearing following the 20 March elections because, 
judging from the recent surveys, they still do not have the 
minimum number of votes required by law. The three parties -- 
MSN, National Solidarity Movement; MUN, National Unity Movement, 
and the MADC, Authentic Christian Democratic Movement -- have 
not yet obtained 1 percent of the votes, which is necessary to 
remain active in politics. (San Salvador Canal Doce Television 
in Spanish 0300 GMT 3 Mar 94) 
  Edgardo Rodriguez, MSN presidential candidate, said the 
latest surveys conducted by private universities lack 
credibility. He said the MSN will not get 1 percent of the 
votes in the next elections and added that there could be 
surprises on election day. (San Salvador Canal Doce Television 
in Spanish 0300 GMT 3 Mar 94) 
  Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate for the Democratic 
Convergence, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, and 
the National Revolutionary Movement, said the results of the 
latest surveys show there will be a runoff presidential election 
because no one will get enough votes to win in the first round. 
He added that the final vote will be between Arena and the 
Democratic Convergence. (San Salvador Canal Doce Television in 
Spanish 0300 GMT 4 Mar 94) 
  Presidential candidate Ruben Zamora visited Zacatecoluca, La 
Paz Department, on 6 March and promised more credit for the 
agriculture sector and development projects if he wins the 
election. He made the promise during a rally held at the Jose 
Simeon Canas Park in Zacatecoluca. (San Salvador LA PRENSA 
GRAFICA in Spanish 7 Mar 94 p 4) 
  Presidential candidate Ruben Zamora said the United States 
has remained neutral with regard to the Salvadoran elections. 
For the first time the United States will not support any 
candidate because it does not perceive any threat from any of 
the candidates, Zamora said. Washington has stated that it 
"will work with any candidate who wins the election," the 
leftist candidate said. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2302 
GMT 8 Mar 94) 
  Fidel Chavez Mena, presidential candidate for the Christian 
Democratic Party, promised to eliminate the Value-Added Tax and 
freeze the prices of staples during the first six months of his 
administration if he wins the election. Chavez Mena made the 
promise during a rally held in Chirilagua, San Miguel 
Municipality on 5 March. (San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in 
Spanish 7 Mar 94 p 5) 
  The seven Salvadoran presidential candidates for the 20 
March 
elections agreed on the need to promote urgent programs to 
improve the country's health and education systems. The seven 
candidates signed an agreement regarding this with UNICEF. 
UNICEF has suggested that governments should spend at least 30 
percent of the national budget on education and 15 percent on 
health. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1951 GMT 7 Mar 94)

electoral platform for 1994-2000: "Certainty, Responsibility, 
and Change for Mexico"] 
  [Text]Electoral Platform 1994-2000 
  Society demands certainty and security. It wants to face the 
future with clarity and without fear; society wants job and 
income security; security for its savings and investments; 
society wants security in its daily life and wants certainty in 
the institutional order, in politics, in the exercise of its 
rights, and in the work of the authorities. 
  Society demands recognition of its maturity and capacity to 
cooperate and assume public responsibilities. It wants to 
actively participate in national progress but also demands 
greater responsibility from the parties, from which they expect 
democratic consensus, definite commitments, and reasoned 
proposals. Society demands from the authorities honesty, social 
sensibility, efficiency, and strict observance of the law. 
  Society is willing to take on the challenges of change. It 
knows it must reform to move ahead. It values the efforts made, 
but it demands to go further. Society is aware that the bases 
have been laid down for a better future, but demands greater 
well-being, justice, and increased opportunities. 
  In the face of these demands for certainty, responsibility, 
and change, the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] makes 
the following commitments; 
<H5>  Mexico's Democratic Transformation </H5>
  Mexico's democratic transformation is our answer to the 
challenge to build an institutional and political order that 
gives the nation certainty. It is our answer to the demands for 
an open and responsible authority. It is the government's 
responsibility to guarantee security, order, and the framework 
of stability that democracy requires. It is up to the parties 
to work to build a proper and legitimate representation of 
social needs. It is up to society to encourage tolerance, 
legality, and openness in electoral processes. The effective 
exercise of his or her political rights through responsible 
participation is up to each citizen. 
  Democratic transformation is an overall process that extends 
to all spheres of social life, and particularly to the electoral 
processes. 
  Our pledge is to specifically encourage open electoral 
processes and seek a confident vote through institutional and 
civilized competition with other political options. 
  In order to consolidate democratic transformation the PRI 
assumes that it is necessary to: 
  -- Have full respect for public and private freedom. 
  -- Favor the free expression of ideas. 
  -- Encourage social well-being. 
  -- Establish clear and fair rules for electoral processes. 
  -- Motivate a culture for legality, dialogue, and the 
recognition of plurality. 
  -- Encourage broad citizen participation. 
<H5>  Guarantee Mexico's Sovereignty and Interests in the World </H5>
  Mexico is a sovereign State whose independence, unity, and 
integrity has been the work of generations. Our commitment is 
to strengthen the nation's sovereignty in the changing 
conditions of this century's end. 
  There cannot be, nor should there be a separation between 
domestic and foreign policy. In the domestic sphere, 
sovereignty is upheld by the full exercise of political 
liberties, the keeping of the law, in the democratic exercise, 
and in a vigorous economy that should be the source of 
well-being and social justice. Internationally, fidelity to our 
principle of people's self- determination; no intervention; the 
peaceful solution of controversies; the prohibition of the use 
of threats or force in international relations; the states' 
equality before the law; international cooperation for 
development; and the struggle for peace and for international 
security have won us the respect and acknowledgement of the 
world community. 
  To strengthen the nation's sovereignty the PRI makes a 
commitment to: 
  -- Recognize that the nation's highest values and its 
first responsibility lie in the acknowledgement of sovereignty. 
  -- Maintain the nation's direct control over the energetic 
resources and the state's control over the strategic areas 
pointed out in the Constitution. 
  -- Act in strict compliance with our constitutional 
principles on foreign policy. 
  -- Encourage international cooperation under shared 
opportunities and responsibilities. 
  -- Sponsor our culture to reinforce the nation's identity 
and unity. 
<H5>  Strengthen a Stable Economy </H5>
  In the process of economic change and trade opening, the 
state cannot leave aside its responsibilities, the state must 
maintain a framework of macroeconomic stability and guarantee 
opportunities for creativity's free development and social 
initiative. The state must also promote savings and investment; 
foster productivity; broaden regional infrastructure; support 
the modernization of micro, small, and medium businesses; 
promote job training; watch over the strict compliance of work 
regulations; and generate favorable conditions for salary 
betterment. 
  The challenge in economic and social matters is to increase 
well-being, income, and the quality of life for all Mexicans. 
It is necessary to generate more and better jobs, increase the 
true salaries, and undertake an active social policy oriented 
particularly toward the groups that require greater support so 
they may be incorporated into the benefits of growth. 
  We should be responsible with what we have already achieved 
in the economy, preserve it, and construct a new horizon of 
possibilities, without losing sight of the social objective that 
gives significance to all productive activity. Our commitment 
is of a responsible economic policy that is at the service of 
mankind, particularly to the less favored individuals and groups. 
  For the development of a strong economy, the PRI promises: 
  -- To guide the economy with a clear sense of 
responsibility to face the needs of the present and future 
generations. 
  -- To promote stable economic growth that can lead to 
social welfare. 
  -- To fight poverty and backwardness. 
  -- To promote the creation of more and better jobs. 
  -- To increase productivity and the income level of the 
population. 
  -- To support the efforts of companies and guarantee fair 
competition. 
<H5>  Balanced Regional Development </H5>
  The Mexican nation is made up of multiple regions with their 
own productive characteristics and traditions. The strength of 
the nation is the strength of its regions. To take full 
advantage of the potential of our regions is a fundamental 
condition for our economic growth and social welfare. There is 
no reason to justify the difference in opportunities between the 
rural and urban areas and among the various regions of the 
country. Utility services, education, health, and job 
opportunities must be distributed throughout the entire national 
territory. 
  True regional development also requires a rational and 
careful exploitation of our natural resources. Each region, 
each community, each corner of our country is a unique 
expression of opportunities, culture, talent, and natural 
resources. The wealth of our national development lies in the 
natural, cultural, and social heritage of our regions. 
  We promise to close the gap that separates our rural reality 
from urban life, preserving the natural conditions for the 
development of future generations. 
  To promote regional development, the PRI promises: 
  -- To support a balanced development that can integrate 
the various regions of the country with the national and 
international markets. 
  -- To expand the communication and transportation 
infrastructure. 
  -- To carry out actions aimed at improving the quality of 
life in urban areas. 
  -- To expand economic development opportunities and 
improve social welfare levels in rural areas. 
  -- To take advantage of the natural resources of each 
region in a rational and well-balanced manner. 
<H5>  Social Reform </H5>
  Our party's basic aspiration is to improve the quality of 
life of those who face the greatest deprivation and limitation. 
The economic progress of the last few years places us in a 
favorable position to begin an extensive and profound social 
reform. Our main investment must be in the people so that each 
citizen can fully develop his own abilities. 
  All Mexicans deserve to live in dignity, to enjoy the hope 
of 
improvement and the true opportunity to develop as an 
individual. Not only does poverty affect those who suffer it, 
but it weakens and harms the nation. Our commitment is to 
engage in a head-on struggle against poverty, in order to be 
able to fill the needs and provide basic services for the 
poverty stricken communities, and expand the government's 
protection and social development network to the whole 
population. 
  The Indian communities will receive all our support and 
respect. Their shortages will receive special attention from our 
social reform. We join their struggle to improve their 
production opportunities, to increase social well-being, and 
ensure respect for their rights. We are also convinced that the 
Indians must participate more decisively in the direction of 
their communities and in the development of policies for solving 
their problems and attaining their goals. 
  The struggle against poverty is the government's single most 
important social responsibility. Furthermore, this task must 
bring the people and the volunteer and self-improvement social 
organizations together, so they can participate and become a 
part of the grand joint alliance in search of unbiased 
prosperity. 
  Our commitment is to a social reform program that can 
improve 
the quality of life of those who face the greatest deprivation 
and limitation, and guarantee opportunities for well-being and 
progress for all. 
  To aid in the development of this social reform plan, the 
PRI 
hereby makes the following commitments: 
  -- To fight poverty and promote progress for those who 
have less. 
  -- To actively develop policies that offer support for the 
Indian, with direct participation from the Indian communities 
themselves. 
  -- To struggle for equal job, education, housing, and 
well-being opportunities for all social groups alike. 
  -- To expand and improve health, nutrition, housing, and 
social security programs. 
  -- To promote social support programs for groups with 
specific needs, according to gender, age, or personal condition. 
  -- To summon the most wide-spread citizen participation in 
social development programs. 
<H5>  Education for Development and Competition </H5>
  In view of the economic modernization process and growing 
international competition, we embrace the obligation to expand 
and improve our education system. Qualified education, 
available to everyone, is essential in order for changes to be 
the foundation of additional economic development and social 
well-being. 
  Education must be the channel leading to full development 
and 
the creativity of all Mexicans. It must disseminate our values 
and assert our history as well as confer a sense of permanence 
and national pride. It must also be the point of contact 
between our society and humanist tradition, universal culture, 
scientific vision of the world, and technological developments. 
  We are committed to a nationalist and federalized type 
education; an education with quality, sufficient resources, a 
teaching profession endowed with decent living conditions and 
permanent training programs. Our commitment is to 
unquestionably promote and encourage scientific and 
technological development as well as training programs which 
must be linked to the productive sector. 
  Our commitment is to an education system that will open the 
doors to social mobility, justice, economic progress, and 
national fortitude. 
  In order to achieve an education system that will propitiate 
development, the PRI is determined to: 
  -- Support a nationalist and federalized education. 
  -- Promote quality education that is made available to all 
Mexicans. 
  -- Encourage work related training programs. 
  -- Link scientific investigation and technological 
development to all productive sectors. 
<H5>  A New Equilibrium in the Republic's Life </H5>
  Mexican society's new economic and political configuration 
requires an institutional system capable of proclaiming social 
initiatives, individual rights, and public actions. Today, more 
than ever, there is need for public institutions that will 
acknowledge the average citizen's potential, as well as 
society's energy. 
  The republic's new equilibrium demands government reforms. 
We are in need of a government system that is in touch with 
civilian society, capable of providing effective answers through 
a public administration that is modern, professional, and 
respectful of justice. 
  The Republic's new equilibrium demands self-respect in 
political life through the strengthening of a Legislative Branch 
that will be effective in truly representing social positions 
and contribute to promoting social benefits. It also demands 
that the institutions responsible for handing out justice will 
be able to consolidate a framework of trust and confidence in 
the legal system and the public authorities. We are in need of 
a more expeditious justice system, one committed to defending 
the individual's rights. 
  In order to accomplish this new equilibrium in the 
Republic's 
everyday life, the PRI is committed to: 
  -- Proposing government reforms that will consolidate a 
public administration system that is more modern, expeditious, 
professional, and respectful of justice. 
  -- Acknowledging the political capability of every 
institution and every municipality as well as increase their 
respective fiscal resources which will lead to modernizing 
federalism. 
  -- Strengthening the Legislative Branch and guaranteeing 
an expeditious justice system available to all Mexicans. 
  -- Improving public safety within a framework of respect 
for the individual's rights. 
  Today, just as during other moments of our history, the PRI 
is adopting commitments that society demands by presenting 
concrete political proposals. Through Luis Donaldo Colosio, our 
candidate for the presidency of the republic, through our 
candidates for deputies and senators, we are going to confront 
the current challenges with responsibility. Today, the PRI once 
again can rely on the people's support in order to continue 
building a future of certainty and better opportunities for our 
children. We reiterate: Our only commitment is to Mexico.

<F P=106> [Report by Gabriela Coutino and Jaime Aviles] </F>
  [Excerpts] San Cristobal de las Casas, 9 Mar -- [passage 
omitted] San Cristobal's 50 Catholic churches were symbolically 
closed down early today with Civic Front pamphlets from the 
authentic coletos [natives of San Cristobal de las Casas, 
Chiapas]. 
  Moreover, according to the local Attorney General's Office, 
10 Indians, who are members of the Christ's Renewal Evangelical 
Church in Las Margaritas Municipality, were beaten up and 
arrested "reportedly for religious reasons." 
  In Ocosingo -- where approximately 20 journalists were 
detained by federal Army members en route to the San Miguel 
ejido where they were going to try to interview Marcos 
[preceding word published in italics] -- local cattlemen met all 
day long to discuss the sale of their land, and they threatened 
to seize the Santo Domingo Convent, which is under Father Pablo 
Irribarren's authority. [passage omitted] 
Churches Closed 
  "Catholic brethren: This church and all the churches in the 
city will remain closed, starting today, until Bishop Samuel 
Ruiz leaves the city, Chiapas, and Mexico. He is responsible for 
the squatters' conflict and the war in the region.... Pray with 
your family at home because God knows you are with Him and God 
is everywhere. Coleto Civic Front Against Destabilizers." 
  This is the message that was used today to paper 50 Catholic 
churches in San Cristobal. Many of the churches are controlled 
by neighborhood groups according to a tradition which dates back 
to the 1940's. Most of the parishes, however, worked normally 
throughout the day, except for La Merced and San Francisco, 
where the priests did not have the keys to the outer doors. 
  Witnesses said municipal employees were seen last night near 
the churches, where they left the Civic Front's messages. The 
messages were photocopies of a legal size page printed on an 
offset machine. Local journalists said the work might have been 
carried out at the weekly LA NOTICIA's printing shop because it 
has supported the movement against the bishop. 
  Furthermore, a message from the "authentic coletos," the San 
Cristobal Civic Defense Group, whose existence was unknown until 
yesterday, was distributed by hand today. It is an open letter 
to President Salinas de Gortari, Governor Javier Lopez Moreno, 
and Mayor Jorge Mario Lescieur Talavera with new measures to 
pressure Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia. "Our children will not 
attend school because of safety and public health reasons, even 
if this grieves us very much, as long as the squatters are not 
evicted from urban areas in the municipal capital. We would 
rather see our children alive than being used as human shields 
by the invaders who came from various geographic regions to 
provoke us." 
  The document, signed by lumber businessman Ricardo Diaz 
Martinez, who became rich by exploiting the Lacandona jungle 
forests, warns that the decision "is mainly aimed at recovering 
the native's dignity, given the constant aggression of 
subversive groups that, logically, are led by Bishop Samuel 
Ruiz." 
  Meanwhile, Governor Lopez Moreno urged all the local groups 
in Tenejapa, his home town, to "declare a truce and prevent 
violations of the law and the disruption of public peace in the 
region." He said: "The fact that a native of Tenejapa was 
appointed state governor" proves things are changing in Chiapas. 
In his opinion, this proves "the poor also have the right to 
achieve power in Mexico."

  [Text] It is quite probable that the peace dialogue may be 
resumed next week in Chiapas. The situation in the upper part 
of this state is apparently calm. Mario Meneses has a report. 
  [Begin Meneses recording] Everything is calm before the 
holding of the second stage of the peace dialogue. The Chiapas 
residents do not want any more temporary governments and have 
also requested elections this year. In Oaxaca, Bishop Samuel 
Ruiz said a peace agreement will be signed in Chiapas between 
Monday and Tuesday of the coming week. 
  Also, there are so-called civicos that are being given out 
in 
San Cristobal to keep persons from going to church, because 
there is no talk of the world of God, only politics. Some 
groups have threatened to burn the San Cristobal Bishopric 
unless Samuel Ruiz leaves. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Rocio Gonzalez Trapaga; from the "24 Hours" </F>
newscast; passages within quotations are recorded] 
  [Text] Communications and Transportation Secretary Emilio 
Gamboa Patron on Tuesday presided over a ceremony to retire the 
Morelos I satellite from its geostationary orbit, thus ending 
its nine-year life span. Following the ceremony held at the 
Joint Telecommunications Complex [Contel] Satellite Control 
Center in Ixtapalapa, Secretary Gamboa spoke on the importance 
of the Solidaridad I satellite, which replaced Morelos I. 
  [Gamboa] "I would say we will take an important step in 
productivity and efficiency, as demanded by Mexican society and 
the entire world. I am sure the finance, education, trade, and 
educational sectors will be better prepared, and they will be 
much more productive and competitive with the Solidaridad I 
satellite." 
  He said the range of services offered by Solidaridad I will 
render every sector of the country more efficient, and he 
announced that the Solidaridad II satellite will be launched in 
October. 
  [Gamboa] "I am very pleased that the Solidaridad I satellite 
will primarily help in social aspects which are needed by Mexico 
today -- in the education and rural telephone communications 
sectors." 
  At the farewell ceremony for Morelos I, Mr. Andres Massieu, 
assistant secretary of communications and technological 
development at the SCT [Communications and Transportation 
Secretariat] spoke of a new generation of satellites. 
  [Massieu] "It make it possible for us to meet the challenge 
of extending telephone service to rural areas with smaller, low 
cost telephone exchanges to meet the needs of communities that 
have less than 500 inhabitants, are scattered throughout the 
national territory, and have critical communication problems due 
to the country's geography." 
  Roger Diaz de Cossio, special projects coordinator at the 
education secretariat, spoke of the high school television 
service that reaches more than 8,000 schools. 
  [Diaz] "High school education through television is the only 
education service we offer the underprivileged and poor with a 
better quality than that of conventional services." 
  He said this is an economic education model that makes it 
possible to provide a high school education to a town with 500 
residents and a junior high school from which only 10 students 
graduate each year. He said states such as Oaxaca, Chiapas, 
Durango, and Veracruz have three to five times more high schools 
using the television system than the conventional system. He 
said the high school television system is the only option to 
improve the service in Indian zones. He pointed out that only 
by expanding this service and attending the needs of elementary 
and junior high schools every year, will we allow the Mexican 
people to have a 10th grade education average. He said that 
1994 will be an important year during which 10,000 parabolic 
antennas will be installed in high schools using the television 
system, and a digital system will be used to transmit and 
receive the signals. 
  Mr. Roberto Hernandez, chairman of the Mexican Banker's 
Association said: 
  [Hernandez] "The government thus reaffirms its firm 
determination to guarantee that telecommunications will become a 
powerful catalyst for the competitive spirit our economy needs." 
  The ceremony was also attended by Telecomm 
[Telecommunications of Mexico] General Director Carlos (Neri 
Teran), as well as businessmen and Televisa representatives.

<F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo by Jose </F>
Antonio Diaz; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Diaz] What happened this week? Either there are 
many disagreements among cabinet members or you actually 
threatened to resign... 
  [Cavallo] Well, I made a communications error. In one way or 
an other I was the cause of the storm over the past two weeks. 
I admit my responsibility and will do everything in my power to 
avoid a repetition. People inside and outside the government -- 
not the media -- have used the mistakes I made to harm me. They 
believe it would benefit the country if I had a setback and had 
to step down as economy minister. That is nothing new: in all 
governments there are people who dislike some cabinet members. 
I have faced many problems within the government but I have 
always had Carlos Menem's full support. The ministers who have 
generally and repeatedly disagreed with me or confronted me have 
had to listen to the president's reiterated support for my work. 
The current cabinet composition will enable the entire 
government and I to work together very well. 
  [Diaz] What about the other ministers? How are your 
relations with them? 
  [Cavallo] Let us take the case of the labor minister 
(Armando 
Caro Figueroa): I believe there is full consensus between us, 
like never before, but there was also quite a good understanding 
with former Education Minister Rodolfo Diaz. Former Labor 
Minister Enrique Rodriguez and I viewed labor problems very 
differently. Defense Minister Oscar Camilion and I have a close 
understanding -- much better than with former Minister Erman 
Gonzalez. I have always been on good terms with Foreign 
Minister Guido Di Tella. I never had problems with former 
Education Minister Antonio Salonia, while Jorge Rodriguez is an 
excellent education minister: I would say his personality leads 
him to become engaged in matters that are common to the economic 
area. Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf and I are managing 
regional economies quite well. He placed Juan Antonio Zapata 
[not further identified], who is one of my team. Secretary 
General of the Presidency Eduardo Bauza always helped to make a 
harmonic government, he always played the role of moderator. In 
addition, he is the closest man to the president and can best 
interpret the president's thinking and mood. In other words, 
the government is running well... 
  [Diaz] How come? Now you have no problems with anyone? 
  [Cavallo] There are obviously snipers; some of them from 
Congress, others from the government. Then there are people 
like Barrionuevo [not further identified], who attacked me in a 
shameful manner. There are also those who always take advantage 
of each of my mistakes to try to undermine my position. Then 
there is the Radical Civic Union, especially its leaders, who 
want me out. They do it because they are electorally strained. 
Three or four months ago, before signing the pact, Alfonsin 
spoke about me and the economic team with high regard, while he 
strongly attacked President Menem. His aggressiveness returned 
after he signed the Olivos pact when the problems of outlining 
an opposition stand appeared because he had to give up his 
political opposition. This time he spoke against the economic 
plan. He said inflation and recession will return within two 
years -- as if that trend will yield some political benefit for 
him. 
  [Diaz] It is incredible that just 40 days before the 
elections, confrontations within the cabinet have intensified 
and Cavallo is suddenly be seen to be alone... Are you alone? 
  [Cavallo] I can tell you that last week I felt alone -- and 
I 
said so at the cabinet meeting. That was unfair because the 
president has always given me his full support. Yet I did feel 
alone, especially when I was the target of the shameful attack 
by Judge Roberto Marquevich. The only voice I heard in my favor 
was that of Eduardo Menem, who very rightly noted that when I 
said there was vagueness in the DGI [General Directorate of 
Taxation], in no way was I meddling with court decisions or 
speaking against the judge or the courts. People like Deputy 
Alberto Piotti praised Marquevich and criticized me, thus giving 
the impression that I caused a controversy with the courts, 
despite the fact that I never mentioned the judge or commented 
on what he had to decide. 
  [Diaz] But the judge was about to prosecute some officials 
on charges of perjury...? 
  [Cavallo] I suddenly realized that versions were being 
fueled 
from the court itself. The judge personally leaked that he 
would prosecute Gustavo Andres Parino, the national customs 
administrator. That was outrageous: Parino was being attacked by 
those who previously managed the customs finances. He was 
implementing a substantial transformation there, with Tacchi and 
Cossio [not further identified]. Having heard Marquevich's 
attack and reviewed the generalized media opinion that the judge 
was right -- without anyone standing up to defend me, and with 
some Justicialist Party members attacking me -- I felt alone on 
that day. That is why I raised the point at the cabinet. 
  [Diaz] Did you threaten to resign...? 
  [Cavallo] Never. I never threatened to resign. Neither once 
nor on many occasions, as some people have said. I would never 
resign in a situation that could jeopardize the continuity of 
the economic program and the success of our government work. I 
would never step down for my own personal benefit, jeopardizing 
what we have accomplished through the Menem government. The 
president knows this very well. 
  I am also convinced that -- contrary to what many have 
suggested -- President Menem's is not trying to overshadow me. 
I believe it is natural that Menem should claim for himself the 
leading role in this process, because he is the one who has led 
it. I think he should feel uncomfortable when people want to 
make me appear almost on the same footing with him, as far as 
the merit for what is being done is concerned. I may have my 
own merits, but the factor that led to Argentina's 
transformation is the political determination, leadership, and 
courage of Menem. Some people believe I say this just to please 
Menem. It is, however, how I feel... 
  [Diaz] You believe there was a minor conspiracy against 
you... 
  [Cavallo] No... Some people tried to use my communications 
mistakes or those verbal confrontations to attain sectorial 
objectives or to defend personal interests or the interest of 
groups with respect to the economic policy. To me this is very 
clear. 
  [Diaz] What interests? 
  [Cavallo] Economic and political interests. Economic 
interests, like all that occurred in connection with the 
automobile regulations. Such regulations, which are eight years 
old, stem from a total ban on importing automobiles. The ban is 
temporary, it is similar to the ones that are being enforced in 
Mexico, it was accepted by NAFTA countries, and it was suggested 
at the Uruguay round of GATT talks. Even though the automobile 
sector is today much more liberal than it was four or five years 
ago -- despite the fact that when this campaign began the 
newspapers reported a drop in car prices -- despite all that, 
they intend to compel us to enforce total liberalization. They 
took advantage of that opportunity to insist on their 
objectives. I believe they are being driven by economic 
interest. Others are doing it for, say, political motivation: 
it is undoubtedly tantalizing and attractive for the middle 
class to buy cars at half the current price, in a much larger 
number of installments, and with the choice of any model. Yet 
any responsible person will understand that transition from a 
totally closed economy -- like that of Argentina's automotive 
sector -- to a totally open economy in a technically complex 
sector with strong world competition, is not that easy. 
  [Diaz] Are there any other economic sectors or interested 
groups that seek to sabotage your plan? 
  [Cavallo] There was a lesser-known sector that tried it. 
They began to attack the customs office. There is a set of 
businesses linked with mail, transportation, and cargo services, 
which seeks to remain as a monopoly. They want me out to avoid 
disclosure of what comes through the airport... Nothing will be 
left of this monopoly, even though it began during the military 
government, it flourished during the Radical administration, and 
it managed to survive at the beginning of the Menem 
administration. 
  [Diaz] Some people think your work may now begin to fade, 
because there will be no more income from privatizations, while 
public spending will grow. Is the economy doing well? 
  [Cavallo] I want people to be totally reassured. Argentina 
is doing very well. In the past two months we had very 
important news, to which no attention has been given. There is 
no reason to be afraid. There is no problem whatsoever between 
President Menem and Minister Cavallo. Quite the contrary. I 
don't feel discouraged as economy minister and I am not giving 
up.

  [Text] London -- Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella's 
"innocent" three-day trip to England to visit his son Rafael has 
yielded other results. He discovered that John Major's 
administration considers the issue of negotiations with the 
Menem administration on the issue of oil around the Malvinas 
Island "convenient but not indispensable" and that the United 
Kingdom is "ready" to lift the arms embargo imposed on Argentina 
since the Malvinas war. 
  CLARIN talked with Di Tella, who was staying at the 
Argentine 
Embassy residence in Paris and will arrive back in Buenos Aires 
this morning. 
  [CLARIN] What are the results of your meeting with Foreign 
and Commonwealth Affairs Secretary Douglas Hurd? 
  [Di Tella] I had a long meeting with him and ended up 
clarifying two important issues: negotiations on oil 
exploration, which will have a busy agenda, and the issue of 
relations with Chile. It was established that we will cooperate. 
They consider British-Argentine negotiations "convenient but not 
indispensable," and we consider them "indispensable." The two 
countries have agreed that it is "convenient." 
  [CLARIN] Has Hurd offered you seismic prospecting results or 
told you how much oil there is in the islands? 
  [Di Tella] They have not been very explicit and they have 
not 
given me any seismic prospecting work. They assured us that they 
are still not sure how much oil there is in the area. 
  [CLARIN] Did he reproach you for Argentina's "theft" of the 
seismic prospecting carried out on orders of the island's 
government through an Argentine ghost company? 
  [Di Tella] They did not complain. On the other hand, it was 
not a ghost company but a YPF [Government Oil Deposits] 
subsidiary. I cannot recall the name of the company now. 
  [CLARIN] Did you establish an agenda to discuss the oil 
situation? 
  [Di Tella] There is "a verbal agreement." But never before 
was the "convenience" of negotiating the issue of oil 
exploration mentioned so explicitly. A technical team will meet 
in April to discuss these questions. 
  [CLARIN] Great Britain's problem is that insurance companies 
refuse to insure "off shore" [preceding two words in English] 
explorations in conflict zones such as the area around the 
Malvinas Islands. In the back of their minds they have the ghost 
of what happened with Kuwait's oil wells, which were set on fire 
by the Iraqis. How will Argentina take advantage of this 
situation in negotiations for the Malvinas Islands? 
  [Di Tella] Argentina can create serious juridical problems 
for Great Britain in the South Atlantic. We are going to do just 
that. The British Government is at a point where it must discuss 
the issue of oil exploration with us. Our "warning notes" on the 
matter have worried companies in the area. 
  [CLARIN] Are you using that as a future threat? 
  [Di Tella] It is not a threat. That is life...If you push a 
door bell you will hear a noise...I will take every legal step 
possible to achieve our objective. 
  [CLARIN] Did you discuss the Argentine Government's 
apprehensions about British interference in Argentine-Chilean 
relations? 
  [Di Tella] That was one of the main reasons for my trip and 
my interest in seeing Hurd. It was one of the topics on our 
agenda. I talked to him about the excellent status of 
Argentine-Chilean relations and the need we have for Great 
Britain to help consolidate it. 
  [CLARIN] What did Hurd say about Margaret Thatcher's visit 
to 
Chile in the next few days? 
  [Di Tella] Hurd told me that Mrs. Thatcher is going to Chile 
because "she feels like it." Maggie has "never" (in English), 
and least of all now, accepted pressure from anyone. She is 
promoting her "Memories" and has made more than 3 million pounds 
from it. For her the monetary issue is very important. She 
cannot be pressured, least of all by John Major's government. 
  [CLARIN] Why will Hurd travel to Malvinas if 
British-Argentine relations are so good? 
  [Di Tella] Hurd simply told me: "I have been in the post for 
five years and never visited the islands. Besides you are very 
active diplomatically and you visit us every three months." I 
am highly encouraged to see that my "charming [preceding word in 
English] operation" is yielding these results. 
  [CLARIN] According to British sources, the Major government 
is ready to sell arms to Argentina. 
  [Di Tella] They can offer them. We do not have any problems. 
We want an end to the arms embargo. In this visit to London I 
had the impression that the arms embargo issue will soon be a 
thing of the past.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Laura Avignolo] </F>
  [Text] London -- For the first time since the Malvinas War, 
the chief of the government intelligence services, Hugo 
Anzorreguy, was received by his British counterparts during an 
official 36-hour visit to London. This courtesy will be 
returned in Buenos Aires today, when David Spedding -- the 
number two man in the British MI6 service, and the future number 
one by the end of 1994 -- will arrive here for a three-day stay. 
  As a result of this meeting it was decided that SIDE 
[Secretariat for State Intelligence] agents will be trained in 
"intelligence analysis" by British spies "in the next few 
months." 
  During a rainy morning yesterday, and watched over by 
discreet bodyguards, Anzorreguy held a long conversation in 
impeccable English with Colin McColl, chief of the domestic 
espionage service MI5 [title as received]. 
  More feminine, Stella Rimmington -- the first woman 
directing 
the foreign secret service MI6 [title as received] -- invited 
him on the same day to lunch at San Lorenzo restaurant, Lady 
Di's favorite restaurant in Knightsbridge, near Harrods. 
Rimmington extended the invitation to Anzorreguy's wife, 
Margarita Moline O'Connor, who accompanied her husband on this 
"tour of espionage and good manners" through Spain, France, and 
London. 
  Anzorreguy's visit had previously been canceled due to the 
illness of President Carlos Menem. 
  With British coolness, Colin McColl told Anzorreguy -- five 
minutes after beginning the conversation -- that the British 
intelligence services are very discreet: They do not grant 
interviews, or allow photographs, or let any information be 
leaked. In subliminal language he meant to say that the 
conversation should be kept strictly "off the record." 
  Anzorreguy was appalled with the MI5 chief's knowledge of 
the 
Argentine "dirty war"; he knew so much that it was as if he had 
absorbed the minds of an Argentine military officer and a 
guerrilla member. 
  The subject of terrorism monopolized the conversation, 
together with the problem of immigration as a possible source of 
conflict. 
  For McColl, the problems are the Pakistanis, Indians, and 
residents of the former British colonies in the Caribbean. 
Anzorreguy told him that their equivalent, for Argentina, are 
the Paraguayans, Bolivians, Chileans, and Peruvians who want to 
come to Argentina "dazed by the economic miracle." 
  When a year ago Anzorreguy visited the chief of the Russian 
secret services in Moscow, the Russian chief's first question 
was very direct. "Tell me what Galtieri was like," the Soviet 
spy asked with curiosity, in referring to the Argentine general 
who commanded the Malvinas War. Anzorreguy swallowed his 
feelings, remembered the description of "majestic general" used 
by an aide to (former U.S. President) Reagan to describe the 
mastermind of the invasion of the islands, and answered: "He 
was a presumptuous general." 
  Stella Rimmington did not ask a single question about the 
Malvinas War, and much less about Galtieri's personality or 
about the investigations into the soldiers executed in the 
Malvinas Islands. In her new and austere office with a view of 
the River Thames, the MI6 chief aimed the conversation toward 
the danger of nuclear proliferation without control and 
terrorism. 
  Rimmington walks daily from her house to her office without 
any guards; she has been photographed only once; she has no 
domestic servant; and she is an expert Sovietologist. 
  During their conversation Anzorreguy stressed the "excellent 
diplomatic relations" between Argentina and Chile. 
  When CLARIN asked Anzorreguy about the misunderstandings 
between Chile and Argentina that Argentine Foreign Ministry 
sources attributed to the British Government, "Mr. Five" [senor 
cinco] minimized these: "These are pranks that we could play, 
too," he said.

  [Excerpt] (DYN-NA) -- Radical Party deputies lodged a 
complaint in the Lower House yesterday to protest against the 
news that British secret services will be training Argentine 
agents in intelligence analysis. 
  The complaint was made known after city daily CLARIN 
published an article on Tuesday [8 March] saying that the 
agreement had been reached by SIDE [Secretariat for State 
Intelligence] state intelligence agency Secretary Hugo 
Anzorregui on a visit to Britain on Monday [7 March]. 
  A document signed by Deputy Antonio Berhongaray said that 
the 
deputies in question were both "surprised and disapproving" of 
the development especially given the recent history of conflict 
between Argentina and Britain. 
  They wrote that even if the service was essential it would 
have to pose no danger to "strategic policy and basic 
common-sense." 
  They added: "It seems obvious to the unaware mind that the 
training of personnel by foreign intelligence services enables 
the country carrying out the task to gain valuable insight into 
professional training and the makeup of the other country."

  [Excerpt] Richard Nottage, Secretary of the New Zealand 
Ministry of External Relations and Trade, arrived in town 
yesterday as part of a three country tour which includes Chile 
and Mexico. 
  In an interview with the HERALD Nottage said he was here 
looking into a wide range of foreign policy issues and economic 
and trade matters, stressing the common interests which exist 
between Argentina and New Zealand -- southern hemisphere 
countries who are non-permanent members of the UN Security 
Council, major agricultural producers who compete on several 
fronts but share common problems such as protectionism. In 
outlining the current state of affairs between both countries 
Nottage underscored the high degree of cooperation being 
achieved on matters of common interest, singling out the Cairns 
Group and the GATT Uruguay Round negotiations as two examples. 
  One of the questions being looked into with great detail is 
what happens to both countries after the Uruguay Round. Nottage 
said both he and his team -- which includes Crawford Falconer, 
Director of the ministry's American Division; Ms. Lackey, 
Director of Trade Negotiations and Ambassador Frank Wilson, who 
is New Zealand's representative before the governments of Chile 
and Argentina -- were also looking into opportunities for 
further economic cooperation between both countries as well as 
between trade blocs, Mercosur [Common Market of the South], 
ASEAN, APEC, etc. 
  Reviewing global issues Nottage pinpointed trade and the 
environment as being of particular interest. Within the latter a 
whole range of topics such as forests, fishing and the climate 
were currently being studied. As far as the economy was 
concerned Nottage mentioned the importance of the New Zealand 
experience of domestic economic reform started in 1984, under 
which a highly regulated market had been opened to competition 
through privatization of state enterprises. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] (DYN-NA) -- President Carlos Menem spoke out 
yesterday against the legalization of abortion during a speech 
in the Colon Theatre and announced plans for a campaign to 
combat the levels of infant mortality in the country. 
  Echoing the view of the Roman Catholic Church towards 
abortion, Menem said: "Life begins at the moment of conception 
and anything done to destroy that life is bordering on crime." 
  The line brought rapturous applause from an audience 
including politicians and nongovernmental pressure groups. 
  Under current law abortion is forbidden except for cases 
such 
as rape or where the life of a mother is considered to be in 
extreme danger due to the birth. Some bishops have been 
pressurizing the government to include a law against abortion in 
the new national Constitution when it is reformed in August. 
  Also in his speech the head of state said he hoped to reduce 
the rate of infant mortality to below 20 for every 1,000 
children born. The current figures of mortality are 21.54 per 
thousand. 
  Menem added that the strategy would be part of a new Federal 
Plan for Mothers and Children, which would seek to improve 
health care and nutrition. 
  To assure that the law embraces the whole country -- Menem 
cited figures of three million children and 650,000 mothers who 
would be targeted -- he said he would introduce a Federal Pact 
to be signed by all provinces. 
  The plan will be monitored by groups such as UNICEF, Caritas 
and the Argentine branch of the Red Cross. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The case involving the Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left [MIR] and its alleged links to drug 
trafficking has been submitted once again to FELCN [Special 
Antinarcotics Force]. A decision will be made in the next few 
hours. 
  The decision by the Chamber of Deputies' Constitutional 
Committee to put the investigation of MIR and its alleged links 
to drug trafficking in the hands of the Special Antinarcotics 
Force once again has caused surprise. The decision was 
surprising because the Chamber of Deputies had decided that the 
committee would investigate the cases. However, things changed 
after a suspicious -- so to speak -- visit by U.S. Embassy 
officials to committee Chairman Edil Sandoval. 
  [Begin recording] [Sandoval] Well, what has actually 
occurred 
is that the Chamber of Deputies has ordered an investigation 
focusing exclusively on possible links between MIR leaders and 
drug trafficking. In other words, it is an area in which the 
chamber has ordered an investigation but, I reiterate, it will 
focus on MIR leaders allegedly linked to drug trafficking. 
  That is to say, there will be no interference in the 
investigations being performed by FELCN into the problem as a 
whole, that is, the fight against drug trafficking. The 
committee is not interfering with those activities. We will 
concentrate our investigation on MIR leaders who might be linked 
to drug trafficking. 
  [Unidentified reporter] However, yesterday ... [changes 
pattern] today newspapers published a statement by you saying 
that the matter could be returned to FELCN. 
  [Sandoval] A minor disagreement has arisen, and we will 
continue to debate it in the committee. It refers to the fact 
that a brief, fast analysis of case folders has revealed -- 
especially to me -- that the FELCN investigation is not over 
yet. Even the report FELCN has submitted to the judicial branch 
is an investigation that has not been finished yet. I have 
concluded therefore that this investigation, which -- I 
reiterate -- is not over yet, should continue and that we -- 
despite the mandate we received from the Chamber of Deputies -- 
should not interfere in that investigation. That is why I 
suggested to the Constitution Committee that all the 
investigations the FELCN is currently conducting be submitted to 
the committee upon their completion and not to the regular 
courts. The proposal's objective is to prevent the overlapping 
of work and to concentrate all matters involving political 
leaders under the committee's jurisdiction. 
  [Reporter] Did the courtesy visit by U.S. Embassy officials 
have anything to do with this? 
  [Sandoval] No, not at all, because I made the decision 
before 
the visit by the Embassy officials. [end recording] [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] One person dead and 18 wounded is the result of coca 
producers' resistance to the government's determination to 
eradicate coca plantations. Amalia Pando prepared the following 
report: 
  [Begin recording] [Pando] Coca producers staged a massive 
ambush of 80 Umopar [Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas] and 
Direco [Coca Reduction Directorate] agents and (chaqueadores) in 
Entre Rios between 0300 and 0600 on 5 March. As a result, one 
person was killed, 18 wounded, five individuals were taken 
hostage, and two jeeps and three pickup trucks were dynamited 
and set on fire. 
  This is how Interior Minister German Quiroga reported what 
happened in Chapare: 
  [Quiroga] We discovered two maceration pits in this area 
[pointing at map]. Our instructions in these cases are to 
destroy 1,300 square meters of coca plantations, that is, 10 
percent of an hectare, more or less. Nearly 1,000 peasants stood 
by while we destroyed that coca. They accepted the destruction 
of the crops around the two pits, which they could clearly see. 
  When Direco and Umopar forces started back to their vehicles 
parked on the road, they encountered a first group of peasants 
-- about 1,000 of them -- who were told that the people who were 
leaving were those who destroyed the maceration pits and the 
coca crops around them. The peasants opened the way and let them 
pass. 
  But after walking another 250 meters, they encountered a 
second group of peasants -- also about 1,000 strong -- who 
blocked their way out. When the officials tried to withdraw they 
realized that the first group was behind them. Therefore, what 
happened here was an ambush. Between 2,000 and 2,500 peasants 
ambushed Umopar agents, Direco forces, and the coca cutters 
[macheteros] who came with them. They were all ambushed by the 
2,000 peasants. 
  Among them, nearly 500 were (chacas) and (boleros). (Chacas) 
are people who trade coca leaf while (boleros) collect cocaine 
paste. Nearly 25 percent of these 2,000 individuals were not 
peasants; they were not from the area. This was noticeable 
because of the way they dressed. They wore shorts, dark glasses, 
stripped garments, etc. 
  The peasant leader then gave the order to attack. 
  [Unidentified reporter] How large was the government force 
that was attacked? 
  [Quiroga] Approximately 80 individuals, including soldiers 
and those waiting in the vehicles. 
  As a result of the confrontation that followed the attack 
ordered by the peasant leaders, eight Umopar agents were 
wounded, including an officer who is in serious condition and is 
being treated at (Huayanini) Hospital in Santa Cruz. Ten Direco 
officers also were wounded. One of the prosecutors who followed 
the operation -- all operations are controlled by prosecutors 
under the Special Antinarcotics Force's charter -- also was 
wounded. He was speared in the abdomen and taken by helicopter 
to Cochabamba. In all, 18 people were injured during the 
confrontation and one individual died. He was a Direco employee. 
The peasants took three hostages. They are still being kept 
hostage at this minute. Two other Direco officials disappeared 
and their whereabouts are unknown. 
  [Pando] Minister Quiroga said no one was injured among the 
peasants because Umopar forces did not use their weapons. The 
exception was a peasant who lost a hand trying to place a 
dynamite stick under a truck. Quiroga said the five vehicles 
waiting to pick up the coca cutters were dynamited, and that on 
the afternoon of 5 March another crowd set Direco offices in 
Ivirgazama on fire. Quiroga added that Umopar was able to 
disconnect a bomb made up of three small barrels filled with 
explosives. 
  Regarding the identification of the machete holder who died 
in the ambush, Quiroga said his name is not known because the 
body remains in the hands of the peasants, adding that one of 
the hostages who managed to escape saw him. Quiroga said no one 
has been arrested so far, adding, however, that those 
responsible for the 5 March ambush and attacks will be arrested 
and placed at the disposal of the courts. 
  Quiroga insisted that the government is ready to talk with 
Chapare leaders and is waiting for the confirmation of a meeting 
arranged with them in principle for 9 March. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The Bolivian Labor Federation [COB], coca 
growers, and government representatives continue to meet in an 
effort to reach agreement over the eradication of coca 
plantations in Chapare. 
  Following last night's meeting with government officials, 
the 
Chapare coca growers were today satisfied with the progress.

start of the meeting, the government apologized to coca growers 
for having accused them of producing drugs. [end recording] 
  He added that the government is also willing to end the 
forceful eradication of plantations: 
  [Begin recording] This will definitively ease social tension 
in tropical Chapare and prevent confrontations. This is 
basically what we have accomplished. It is not enough. 
Discussions should go deeper into the technicalities and the 
institutional framework of alternative development to see how 
the government can guarantee funds for true alternative 
development. [end recording] 
  Deputy Ramiro Barrenechea, adviser to coca growers, said the 
end of forceful eradication in return for peasants joining the 
voluntary eradication plan -- which involves financial benefits 
per eradicated hectare -- is a trap by the government. In an 
effort to prevent coca growers from signing an agreement to this 
end, Barrenechea went today to the Labor Ministry where a final 
meeting is being held to consider the subject. [passage omitted] 
  Coca growers have backed down on their decision to sign an 
agreement on the topics agreed upon last night. They will not 
agree to any type of eradication. They admitted, however, that 
there are new illegal coca farms in Chapare. They said they 
will defend them, because -- as they put it -- the government is 
to blame. 
  [Begin Morales recording] In the face of the unfulfilled 
promises and the lack of alternative development, we have no 
alternative but to plant coca. The peasants are not to blame 
for planting coca. It is the free market policy, the free 
importation policy which is encouraging coca growing, not just 
in Bolivia but in the entire Andean region. [end recording]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Bolivia monitored through 10 
March. 
  National Treasury Under Secretary Edgar Saravia reported 
that 
the Treasury expects to collect 3.6 billion bolivianos for the 
1994 national budget. The projected revenues are higher than 
those collected last year. (La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 19 Feb 94 
p B2) 
  Bolivian Central Bank, BCB, President Fernando Candia stated 
that this year the BCB will be able to grant $100 million to 
$120 million in credits to the private sector because of the 
level of its international reserves, which totals $330 million. 
(La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 24 Feb 94 p A16) 
  Oil production in the tropical zone of Chapare, Cochabamba 
Department, rose to 7,000 barrels per day. It accounts for 24.3 
percent of the total production, after Santa Cruz Department. 
(La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 27 Feb 94 p 7) 
  The economic growth in the year's first two months was slow 
compared with the goals projected for this period. The consumer 
price index increased 0.83 percent in January, which is "low" 
compared with those registered in the same month of the last 
three years. (Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS in Spanish 27 Feb 94 p A11)

  [Text] The only amendment to the Constitution passed by the 
Constituent Congress during yesterday evening's nine-hour 
session was the one providing for the shortening of the tenure 
of the Brazilian presidency to four years. 
  After a three-hour discussion during which passions ran 
high, 
the Constituent Congress upheld the text that bans the head of 
state from running for the presidency a second time. The 
reelection of governors and mayors was also rejected. 
  The motion seeking to reduce -- to 90 days before the 
elections -- the deadline for the president, governors, and 
mayors to resign from office in order to run for another 
government post was also voted down. The original 
constitutional text, which provides for a six-month deadline 
before the elections for government officials to resign their 
posts to run for office, was thus passed without amendment. 
  Before adjourning, the Constituent Congress decided that the 
other item included in the order of the day, namely the 
amendment extending maternity leave for congresswomen, will be 
voted on at the end of the week. 
  At 1000 local time today the Constituent Congress will vote 
on political matters. The order of the day includes, among 
other subjects, political affiliation, the voluntary vote, the 
mixed district voting system, and parliamentary immunity.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Six months after issuing a decree -- 
unsuccessful so far -- ordering the sale of government-held 
minority stock in various companies, President Itamar Franco has 
had the official gazette publish yet another decree aimed at 
getting rid of these shares in order to obtain funds to balance 
public accounts. In the 1994 budget, the sale of these shares is 
expected to bring in $900 million. 
  According to the latest decree's foundations, autonomous 
corporations and state companies must turn over the minority 
stock they hold to the National Privatization Fund, which is 
managed by BNDES [National Bank for Economic and Social 
Development], which will handle the sale. BNDES Director Elena 
Landau stated in Rio de Janeiro that her bank is waiting for the 
state companies to provide an inventory of minority stock that 
they have in other companies. 
  The new decree was prompted by the failure of the first 
attempt to force the state companies to sell the minority shares 
they own. Put together, these shares are estimated to be worth 
$900 million. Government experts believe the actual income from 
the sale of these shares will surpass the initial estimate 
because some of the state companies have been privatized since 
the estimate was made and the value of their shares has gone up. 
Thus, state companies that own shares of companies that have 
been privatized will obtain more funds and this, in turn, will 
improve the value of their own shares. 
  There are cases of government companies that are minority 
stockholders in other companies because of fiscal incentives, 
such is the case of Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] 
and Conab [National Supply Company], which own shares of hotels; 
informatics corporations like Dataprev [Social Security Data 
Processing Enterprise], which owns shares of a petrochemical 
company; and Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications 
Corporation], which owns shares of the Uberaba Water Supply 
Company.

  [Text] The government will give at least six days notice 
before the launch of the new Brazilian currency, the real. 
  This was announced today in Belo Horizonte by Central Bank 
President Pedro Malan. 
  Malan said the decision on when to launch the real will 
depend on how widely the URV [Real Value Unit] is being used. 
Malan clearly stated that the change of currency will not take 
place before April. 
  [Begin Malan recording] We promise to give a few days notice 
before the launch of the real in order to give people time to 
settle matters regarding commercial papers with preestablished 
rates, post-dated checks, etc. [end recording] 
  Regarding an agreement with the IMF, Malan said it may be 
signed next week. He added that to safeguard the agreement, 
confirmation on the issuance of bonds to convert the Brazilian 
foreign debt has been postponed. 
  [Begin Malan recording] Brazil and the committee of banks 
have issued a communique addressed to the international 
financial community, which states that we still plan on 15 
April. This date will be confirmed late next week, around 18 
March. [end recording] 
  Pedro Malan confirmed that Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso's economic plan, technically speaking, was approved by 
the IMF mission that visit Brazil recently.

<F P=106> [Interview with Henrique Hargreaves, chief of the Brazilian </F>
civilian household, by William Franca; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Franca] Last week the government reviewed nine 
provisional measures on varied subjects that Congress did not 
discuss. Is there ill-will in Congress against the government? 
  [Hargreaves] The decision by Congress not to vote on a 
provisional measure is sometimes a strategy, sometimes a lack of 
consensus. But there is no ill-will. A political agreement 
usually takes its time but Congress has one virtue: It respects 
every agreement reached. 
  [Franca] In the recent case of the approval of the FSE 
(Social Emergency Fund), the government had to make an extra 
effort: The finance minister had to appear on television and 
almost every minister appeared before Congress. Is it necessary 
to exert "extra pressure" to get Congress to function? 
  [Hargreaves] No. We work to expedite the agreement, to 
explain every point as best we can. 
  [Franca] Was the most recent cabinet reform, which took 
place 
last week, designed to broaden support in Congress? 
  [Hargreaves] Instead of reform I would rather call it 
"cabinet change" because the structure was not modified. The 
appointment of new ministers did not seek to broaden support in 
Congress. 
  [Franca] What prompted President Itamar Franco to invite 
General Bayma Dennis to occupy the Transportation Ministry? Why 
not a politician or an technician in the transportation field? 
  [Hargreaves] The Transportation Ministry, although many may 
consider it to be so, is not such a technical post. It is more 
of an administrative post. There will be elections this year 
and most politicians are running as candidates. Therefore, one 
cannot chose someone for the Transportation Ministry who will 
then resign to run for election in a month. As for a technician 
in this field, no matter how much experience he may have, we 
would not know how capable he would be of administrating this 
ministry at this time of budget difficulties with the 
"difficult" relationship with Congress. We do not deny that the 
Transportation Ministry is experiencing administrative 
difficulties. In view of all this, President Itamar Franco 
decide to chose General Dennis, a military man who enjoys a good 
relationship with politicians and, on top of that, is a good 
administrator. 
  [Franca] In view of the "problems" in the Transportation 
Ministry, was the appointment of Minister Margarida Coimbra, who 
was a technician, a mistake? 
  [Hargreaves] I would not agree. But I did not belong to the 
government when she was appointed. 
  [Franca] Does the presence of a considerable number of 
military men -- on active service or retired -- in the upper and 
middle echelons of government hint at a possible trend toward 
the militarization of Itamar Franco's administration? 
  [Hargreaves] Why should all government officials be 
civilians? Are they not considered equals? That is odd. There 
is no division. The participation of women and men in the 
government does not have to conform to a system proportional 
representation, so why should civilians and military. The 
question: why military? is always raised. Nobody ever asks: why 
civilian? 
  [Franca] The Franco administration is civilian and not 
military. Why then should it insist on that option? 
  [Hargreaves] I can explain that by giving you an example. 
The Federal Police (whose current director is Colonel Wilson 
Romao, retired) have always been headed by a member of the Armed 
Forces -- with the exception of Romeu Tuma and Amaury Galadino. 
They (the military) have always discharged their duties well. 
Romao's appointment was made at a time of crisis that called 
for a speedy reestablishment of discipline, and the military are 
used to doing just that. 
  [Franca] And how about the Sudene (Northeast Development 
Superintendency) and the special commission which is 
investigating irregularities in the executive branch, which are 
both headed by members of the Armed Forces? 
  [Hargreaves] Let us not close our eyes to the obvious: One 
must acknowledge that the military are more disciplined and know 
how to impose discipline. 
  [Franca] Is it easier for Planalto Palace to boss the 
military around, given the fact that they are more disciplined? 
  [Hargreaves] I would not venture to say that it is possible 
to put ideas into the heads of the military, I contended that 
they are more disciplined and can discipline others better than 
civilians. 
  [Franca] Following your line of thought, if prices were to 
skyrocket we could find a military man heading the Sunab 
[National Supply Superintendency] or some other economic 
department. 
  [Hargreaves] I have no prejudices. 
  [Franca] On the question of government support in Congress, 
you said the "cabinet reshuffle" did not seek to broaden its 
support. Does this mean it already has the necessary support? 
  [Hargreaves] I would not say the latest votes reflect the 
support the government has in Congress. I believe they are 
related to the government's stance on the subject. This is not 
the solid support that backs the government. I do not have 
facts and figures to support this, but we have the backing of 
congressmen from all parties rather than one party in coalition 
with the government. 
  [Franca] Given that the government has to work with an 
unspecified number of congressmen who have the most varied 
political tendencies, how will negotiations at the Constituent 
Congress be conducted? 
  [Hargreaves] A Constituent Congress cannot be compared with 
the ordinary work of Congress. The latter functions in terms of 
parliamentary support -- government and opposition -- whereas a 
process involving an amendment to the Constitution has more to 
do with ideological, programmatic, and even dialectical 
questions. 
  [Franca] Does the government believe the outcome of the 
Constituent Congress will measure up to its expectations? 
  [Hargreaves] Yes, it does, it does, (he repeats) it does. 
The government also believes the outlook can be either good or 
bad depending on how the vote on political issues goes. If 
political issues do not fare well, the Constituent Congress may 
lose all meaning. 
  [Franca] What do you mean by "fare well"? 
  [Hargreaves] That solutions be balanced; vested interests 
must be left aside or the process will produce negative results. 
  [Franca] What do think about the idea to extend the deadline 
for ministers and governors to resign from office in order to 
run for another elective post? 
  [Hargreaves] I would rather not speak about specific 
projects. 
  [Franca] Three weeks ago, President Itamar Franco stated in 
Juiz de Fora that "if [Finance Minister] Fernando Henrique 
[Cardoso] were to run for the presidency he would have the 
support of the government." Is Planalto Palace endeavoring to 
turn this hypothesis into reality? 
  [Hargreaves] I cannot answer your question. Planalto 
Palace's overriding concern at present is the success of the 
economic plan. If we mix the two, we will give the impression 
that the economic program is linked to candidacies. They are 
totally separate.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 10 
March. 
  The Management and Economics Science Institute of St. Ursula 
University reported that Brazil's volume of exports increased 
16.2 percent, whereas the value dropped 8.15 percent from 1991 
to 1993 compared with the 1988-1990 period. (Sao Paulo GAZETA 
MERCANTIL in Portuguese 3 Mar 94 p 3) 
  The government increased the electricity rate 43.24 percent 
as of 8 March, the same day the real value unit was implemented. 
It did not explain, however, the reason for the increase despite 
having guaranteed that public utilities prices would not be 
readjusted higher than the inflation rate. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO 
DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 3 Mar 94 Economic and Business 
Section p 1) 
  The inflation rate measured by the Economic Research 
Institute Foundation, FIPE, was 46.25 percent in the past 30 
days that ended 4 March. This is the highest rate registered by 
the FIPE. The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics 
reported that the consumer price index rose 40.27 percent 
between 29 January and 1 March. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO 
in Portuguese 5 Mar 94 p B3) 
  Car manufacturers' production in February totaled 114,700 
units. This is 34 percent more than in February 1993 and the 
largest number ever produced in a single month in the country. 
(Rio de Janeiro Rede Globo Television in Portuguese 2300 GMT 7 
Mar 94) 
  Iron ore exports were 111.9 million metric tons in 1993, an 
increase of 5.5 percent compared with 1992's 106 million metric 
tons. Brazil was the third-largest iron ore producer after China 
and Russia. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 7 March 94 
p 16)

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 
publishes in its 6 March edition, on page 16, four articles by 
Octavio Guedes and Renato Garcia about alleged links between the 
Comando Vermelho drug trafficking gang and the illegal animal 
lottery bankers. 
  The first 400-word article states that police have realized 
that the Comando Vermelho chiefs imprisoned in Bangu I 
penitentiary do not have the wealth that all their criminal 
actions should have given them. Police and judges believe the 
real chiefs of these organizations are not in the slums, where 
there is no infrastructure to launder dollars, import drugs, or 
purchase imported weapons. According to the testimony of some 
gang members, all the money collected in the drug markets, 
nearly $2.5 million per month, was administered by an illegal 
animal lottery banker known as Carlos Alberto Goncalves dos 
Santos, aka Carlinhos Barbudo, who is currently at large. 
  A 200-word article states that the first time the full 
extent 
of the criminal gang was discovered was in the gang case in 
Borel Hill, where close links between community leaders and drug 
traffickers were demonstrated, as well as the existence of a 
"court" to judge those who oppose the laws of the drug 
traffickers, who organize parties to attract drug buyers and 
youths for prostitution. Police found out that about 140 people 
were involved in this illegal scheme in some way. 
  Another 200-word article reports on the activities of 
Carlinhos Barbudo, who was named as the "owner" of the illegal 
animal lottery's gambling sites. According to a gang leader's 
wife, he was the treasurer for the drug markets, and other gang 
members testified that he personally paid drug suppliers. 
  The last 200-word article quotes Rio de Janeiro Civil Police 
Chief Nilo Batista as saying: "Nobody can tell who is the 
Comando Vermelho gang's chief." He says he believes that a good 
portion of the drug trafficking money moved in Rio de Janeiro is 
spent on the drug markets' structure and the purchase of weapons 
and drugs. The remaining money is used to pay bribes to police 
and informers. Nilo Batista maintains that the organizational 
level of the Comando Vermelho gang is very low. The 
best-organized gang, he says, is that headed by drug trafficker 
Orlando da Conceicao, which exploits drug markets in eight slums 
in northern Rio de Janeiro. Police say there is no evidence to 
link the illegal animal lottery bankers with drug trafficking, 
and the Brazilian drug traffickers arrested so far are not rich 
like the Bolivian coca "barons."

<F P=106> [Article by Livia Ferrari] </F>
  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- The UK's chief secretary of the 
Treasury, Michael Portillo, yesterday said that through the 
elimination of the "Brazil risk" clause there is a possibility 
that Great Britain could guarantee the insurance on export 
credits for British products, thus expanding bilateral ties. 
Specifically referring to the commercial opening implemented in 
the country, Portillo said: "We always carefully study the 
economic conditions prevailing in each country, and I believe 
that as a result of the Brazilian economic reform the conditions 
are there for offering guarantees for export credits." 
  Portillo arrived in Brazil at the end of the week at the 
head 
of a business delegation. Yesterday, during a luncheon 
sponsored by the British Chamber of Commerce in Rio de Janeiro, 
where he met with Brazilian businessmen, he expressed interest 
in the Brazilian privatization program. So much so that during 
the morning, after visiting Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum 
Corporation] and Shell, he visited the National Bank for 
Economic and Social Development (BNDES) where he met with 
National Privatization Program Director Elena Landau. 
  "There is interest in all privatization areas," he added, 
and 
specifically in the telecommunications and energy fields. He 
believes that because of their experience in the privatization 
process in Great Britain, British banks may take part in the 
Brazilian privatization program through the sale of certificates 
in those companies that are being privatized on the 
international market. Well versed on the issue, Portillo stated 
that the Brazilian privatization program has already yielded a 
total of $6 billion, while in Great Britain the program totaled 
$75 billion. 
  British interest in the Brazilian privatization process is 
also attested to by the members of the official delegation -- 
British Gas, Northwest Water International, Powergen (all 
companies that were privatized) and the Barings Kleinwort 
Benson, Rothschilds, and Schroders and Warburgs banks, all of 
which have played an active role in the privatization process. 
  Today the British delegation will be in Sao Paulo, where it 
will hold meetings with Sao Paulo State Governor Luiz Antonio 
Fleury Filho and Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf. On 9 March they 
are scheduled to visit Brasilia, where they will hold meetings 
with Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and with 
representatives from the Mines and Energy and Aeronautics 
Ministries. The British companies are interested in 
participating in the Amazon Region Surveillance System (Sivam); 
their bid for the supply of telecommunications equipment 
totaling $600 million has already been opened by the Aeronautics 
Ministry.

  [Text] The Civil Aviation Department (DAC) on 3 March 
reported that Major Brigadier Renato Claudio Pereira, president 
of the Committee for Studies Related to International Air 
Navigation (CERNAI), on 1 March signed a bilateral air 
transportation agreement with Macau, the Chinese territory that 
will be administered by Portugal until 1999. 
  Signing the agreement for Macau was Jorge Ferreira 
Guimaraes, 
president of the Civil Aviation Authority. The agreement now 
will be reviewed by the Sino-Portuguese Liaison Group. 
  A DAC communique states that the agreement "is characterized 
by liberal operational provisions enabling the two parties to 
offer air services between Brazil and Macau to meet the needs 
for transportation of both passengers and cargo between the two 
parties, including those of third countries." 
  Macau is located on the southeastern coast of Asia, 64 km 
west of Hong Kong. The agreement will give Brazilian companies 
greater access to the Asian market.

  [Text] Quito, 8 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Ecuadoran President Sixto 
Duran Ballen announced today the appointment of his new 
information and tourism minister, the third to fill the post 
created a little over one and a half years ago. 
  At a discreet ceremony held this afternoon in the Carondelet 
Palace, the seat of the Ecuadoran Government, Duran Ballen 
appointed and swore in Armando Espinel to replace Carlos Vera. 
  The Information and Tourism Ministry post was created on 10 
August 1992 when Duran Ballen's administration began. Its first 
minister was Pedro Zambrano, who died in 1992 in an airplane 
accident in Quito. 
  Former Minister Carlos Vera was at the palace to turn over 
the post to Espinel, a renowned businessmen in national and 
international tourist circles. After 14 months at the head of 
the ministry, Vera resigned on 22 February due to public 
differences with Vice President Alberto Dahik. The differences 
came to light when Dahik said the government was studying a 
plebiscite to learn of the people's opinion about possible 
reforms to the Constitution. Vera expressed his disagreement and 
argued that the announcement of such a significant topic should 
be exclusively reserved for the president. 
  At the transfer-of-command ceremony, Duran-Ballen denied 
rumors about the possible elimination of the Information and 
Tourism Ministry. The president announced that the ministry will 
be restructured and tourist development efforts will be promoted 
on an international level. He said that the Press Office of the 
Presidency will be in charge of information and attention to 
media representatives until a special office is created for that 
purpose. 
  Espinel is an experienced businessman who has connections 
with the tourist sector in Ecuador and abroad. Among the 
relevant posts he has held is that of president of the Tourism 
Conference of Latin America.

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano] </F>
  [Excerpts] According to an announcement by Gustavo Rossen, 
president of the Banco Latino intervention board, Banco Latino 
could resume operations in 24 days as result of the new 
Emergency Banking Law recently signed at the Miraflores 
Presidential Palace. This morning, the president signed the 
Banking Emergency Law, thereby approving a new legal framework 
aimed at providing financial assistance to all financial 
institutions confronting a liquidity crisis like the one 
plaguing Banco Latino. In signing the new law, President Rafael 
Caldera said it is a decision of solidarity toward thousands of 
Venezuelans affected by the Banco Latino crisis. [passage 
omitted] 
  Delegations representing the banking sector, the National 
Congress, and members of the intervention board were present at 
the signing ceremony. Congressional representatives explained 
some of the benefits the law offers. In addition, the president 
of the Venezuelan banking association said the law establishes a 
framework allowing for the renewal of confidence in the 
country's banking system. 
  [Begin recording] [Democratic Action Deputy Omar Barboza] 
Starting with 10 million or more bolivares, the intervention 
board will be able to limit the application of this index or 
rate in order to repay interest to deposit holders. One thing is 
the guarantee, which amounts to 4 million bolivares, and another 
is the possible limit in applying the consumer price index to 
determine interest. Starting at 10 million bolivares, the 
intervention board is free to apply the interest rates it 
believes to be most applicable to the bank's reorganization 
plans. 
  [National Banking Council President Jose Bouzas] This law 
establishes a framework that will allow solutions to the crisis 
the Venezuelan banking sector is going through to be found. As 
members of the banking sector, we seek to establish guidelines 
allowing the bank's reorganization and the adoption of adequate 
solutions to protect deposit holders thereby enabling them to 
recover all their savings. On the other hand, this law provide a 
legal reference to support and sustain the entire banking 
system, which is currently being assisted by FOGADE [Deposit 
Guarantee Fund]. In other words, if we can ensure joint actions 
between the public and private sector, basically from national 
private banks, I then believe we will be able to establish joint 
programs between the banking superintendency, the Venezuelan 
Central Bank, FOGADE, and national private banks. In addition, 
there will also be the possibility of helping Banco Latino's 
depositors, helping with the bank's reorganization, and in 
finding a solution to the banking system crisis. [end recording] 
  The Central Bank president, who was also present during the 
Emergency Banking Law signing ceremony, insisted this 
institution has carried out its duties according to the law, and 
she indicated that she has all necessary documents to support 
her statements. The documents will be given to the courts soon. 
  [Begin Central Bank President Ruth de Krivoy recording] 
Through out the process, the Central Bank of Venezuela has 
conducted itself strictly in accordance with the law, with 
absolute objectivity. The bank has also promoted immediate, 
timely solutions to all difficulties it experienced. The Central 
Bank has extensively explained its performance to the 
congressional commissions. We also intend to provide all 
necessary details requested by the courts relating to this 
institution's performance. In this respect, I can say that from 
an ethical as well as a banking and monetary policy point of 
view, the Central Bank of Venezuela has conducted itself in 
accordance with the law, and we are willing to prove it to 
whatever level may be necessary. [end recording] 
  Gustavo Rossen, president of the Banco Latino intervention 
board said there are some legal loopholes, which Congress will 
solve soon. At the same time he insisted that Banco Latino 
depositors can rest assured the bank will be bank rolled within 
a very short period. 
  [Being recording] [Rossen] The request we plan to make of 
deposit holders, when the reorganization plan is finally 
approved, is to have confidence that once Banco Latino has been 
bank rolled by the government, then it will once again be one of 
the most solid banks in the country. 
  Deposit holders should not be apprehensive about leaving 
their deposits in the bank because they will be entirely paid 
back. In addition, they are essential if Banco Latino is 
expected to be the type of bank its long time clients want it to 
be: successful, versatile, and a bank capable of providing good 
service to its clients. 
  [Pachano] You have already decided on the details of the 
reorganization plan? It has... 
  [Rossen, interrupting] Yes, we have. 
  [Pachano] Has the plan been presented to President Caldera? 
  [Rossen] No, there is no need to present it to the president 
because it is not up to him to decide. The reorganization plan 
will be presented to the Central Bank of Venezuela in accordance 
with the law, and also to FOGADE. 
  [Pachano] Is it going to be presented this afternoon? 
  [Rossen] This morning we presented it to the Central Bank 
and this afternoon we will present it to FOGADE. 
  [Pachano] Both institutions must approve the plan? 
  [Rossen] That is correct. 
  [Pachano] If they ... 
  [Rossen, interrupting] Because both institutions will 
provide 
the funds to implement the program. 
  [Pachano] If the plan is approved today, how soon will it be 
implemented? 
  [Rosses] The reopening or reorganization plan, whichever you 
prefer, will be implemented in approximately 24 days as of 
[words indistinct]. In his address to the nation, President 
Caldera spoke of 30 days. If I am not mistaken, six days have 
gone by since his address to the nation, therefore we still have 
24 days to reopen the bank. By reopen, we mean reorganize. [end 
recording] 
  Once the Banking Emergency Law signing ceremony concluded, 
Gustavo Rossen headed to the Central Bank of Venezuela to 
present details on the Banco Latino reorganization. During the 
afternoon hours, he will also meet with the FOGADE board of 
directors to explain the reorganization program. If the plan is 
approved, Banco Latino could resume operations in 24 days.

  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The principal challenge to 
President Caldera and his economic team will be to prevent an 
increase in the rate of inflation and to protect the level of 
international financial reserves to prevent a further major 
devaluation, according to economist Gustavo Garcia of the 
Institute of Higher Education for Administration (IESA). 
Economic problems militate against the optimistic scenario of 
maintaining 1993's rhythm of inflation (an average rate of 46 
percent.) 
  Garcia believes that this government has inherited a 
profound 
economic and financial crisis, whose solution becomes more 
difficult because of the country's social problems and the 
restrictions that Caldera himself spoke of in his inaugural 
address (taxes, increase in the price of gasoline). The 
principal reason for the economic crisis is the budget deficit, 
which could reach from 5 to 8 percent of the gross domestic 
product (from 350 billion to 560 billion pesos, respectively). 
  The feasibility of maintaining an accord on prices 
(salaries, 
exchange rates, and prices of goods and services), mentioned by 
some members of the new government, seems unrealistic and 
improbable, according to Garcia. [passage omitted] 
  The new government will apply the IVA [Value Added Tax], 
although with another name, only to wholesalers and with a long 
list of exemptions, which Garcia believes, could contribute to 
higher levels of tax evasion. He warns of the grave error of 
falling into the temptation of using funds from the sale of the 
assets of privatized firms to cover the deficit. 
  The sale of shares in PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.] to 
pay off large amounts of the external debt is another 
possibility, which would also reduce the pressure of interest 
payments. Although this measure is impeccable from a financial 
point of view, it would be dangerous if not accompanied by a 
radical restructuring of government finances. 
  According to the IESA economist, the alternatives for 
financing the deficit are very restricted, because Venezuela's 
access to international financial markets is limited, especially 
when the macroeconomic situation is not sustainable. Economic 
instability would limit the funds that could be obtained from 
the multilateral organizations if there is no clear intention 
and specific plan to put government finances in order. 
  There are also serious restrictions on further increases in 
the domestic debt (new issues of letters of credit in bolivares) 
to finance part of the deficit, because it would mean 
substantial increases in interest rates. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Hernan Mena Cifuentes] </F>
  [Text] The bands that traffic in illegal aliens struck a 
new blow in the past few hours with the illegal entry at the 
international airport of Maiquetia of some 30-odd Chinese and 
Iraqi citizens, less than a week after the arrest of eight 
Indians, who also lacked the necessary visas. 
  The report, confirmed by authorized spokespersons of several 
state security organizations assigned to the airport, states 
that due to the rapid intervention of police intelligence and 
investigative services of the DIEX [Directorate of 
Identification and Alien Affairs], the band has been virtually 
destroyed. However, two of its members, who were identified as 
officials of Interpol and of Immigration, escaped when they were 
about to be arrested. 
  The first group of illegal aliens--six Iraqi 
citizens--arrived last Saturday, 5 February, on board an 
Alitalia flight from Rome and, after paying $18,000, were taken 
from the transit section to the outskirts of the airport, where 
an automobile awaited them that took them to Caracas. 
  On the following day, according to the source, 28 Chinese 
citizens, all illegal aliens, arrived on board a British Airways 
flight from London in transit to Cartagena. They were held at 
the airport and taken to the offices of DIEX, in the customs 
area. 
  Once inside the DIEX offices, there began a scramble among 
several employees of DIEX and Interpol over the division of the 
thousands of dollars that the Asians offered to pay so as not to 
be deported. 
  A dispute the following day, provoked by the alleged contact 
or abettor ( naturalized Chinese) of the illegal Asians, who 
argued heatedly with a member of the band (a DIEX official known 
as "El Maracucho"), insisting that he not demand more money for 
the "service," sparked an investigation by DISIP [Directorate of 
Intelligence and Prevention Services], carried out by personnel 
of the Immigration Investigative Service in Maiquetia. 
  As a result of the investigation, two officials were about 
to 
be arrested who were suspected of being implicated but, 
presumably warned by their accomplices, they "disappeared" and 
are now fugitives. 
  As is widely known, the traffic in illegal aliens at 
Maiquetia is an old story, and many scandals have been uncovered 
that involved senior officials in the Immigration Service in 
this commerce in human beings. 
  Because of the activities of these bands of traffickers and 
mafia-like organizations that operate at Maiquetia, the DIEX 
offices at the airport have been investigated several times in 
recent years, which makes it probable that a similar 
investigation could take place, in an effort to destroy these 
organizations. 
  The entry of illegal aliens through Maiquetia is said to 
have 
produced millions in profits in U.S. currency for the groups 
that engage in this traffic. It is estimated that, between 
Arabs, Chinese, citizens of India and other countries, they have 
brought in thousands of people from various parts of the world.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Pronk Wants To Talk To Suriname in </F>
New York"] 
  [Text] Paramaribo -- Cooperation and Development Minister 
Pronk has suggested to his Surinamese counterpart, R. Assen, 
that they talk about the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) for 
the economy in New York on 19 March. 
  Paramaribo accepted the invitation and has approached the 
Warwick Research Institute (British university) to act as 
adviser. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) will be there 
for the Netherlands. 
  Pronk's invitation is a reaction to the Surinamese proposal 
of 24 February to begin talks as quickly as possible on a 
solution to the lingering question of external guidance for the 
SAP. In Paramaribo, emotions were running high this week 
following the sharp criticism levelled by Pronk at the 
Surinamese approach to the economic crisis. However, with the 
indignant statement made by Assen on the matter, the question 
would appear to be over. 
  The Netherlands is still demanding that Suriname takes on 
the 
IMF as an external adviser for the SAP before there can be any 
talk of resuming economic aid. However, Paramaribo wants to 
throw in its lot with Warwick. Warwick, however, only wants to 
give technical assistance and is "not prepared nor in a 
position" to coercively enforce the required measures, nor to 
advise The Hague on resuming aid.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Mar (EFE) -- The explosion 
of a domestic fuel tank at a restaurant today injured five 
people and caused alarm in downtown Santa Fe de Bogota, 
according to the capital city's corps of firemen. 
  The explosion broke windows in several buildings and caused 
a 
fire in a six-story building which was promptly extinguished by 
the firemen. The explosion occurred when a fuel supply vehicle 
was filling the restaurant's tanks on Jimenez Avenue. The 
explosion was so strong that early reports asserted that it was 
an attack on the building where the Office of the Attorney 
General is located. 
  According to one employee, all of the windows at the 
Attorney 
General's Office were shattered and there was confusion for 
several minutes.

<F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] A bottled gas cylinder exploded this morning near 
the Attorney General's Office. The explosion left six injured 
and damaged several buildings. The area is not dangerous right 
now, because the authorities have the situation under control. 
Our journalist Ana Fernanda Valderrama has the report. 
  [Begin recording] [Valderrama] Thank you, Yolanda. At this 
time the debris left by the explosion of a bottled gas cylinder 
near El Brasero Dorado Restaurant, a few meters from the 
Attorney General's Office, is being removed. A new tragedy has 
occurred in Bogota due to lack of foresight. The authorities, 
fortunately, have the situation under control. Debris is being 
removed now, but earlier there was real panic, a veritable 
paralysis of downtown Bogota this morning. These are the first 
video clips that we have shortly after the tragedy occurred in 
downtown Bogota. 
  Members of the Firemen's Corp, Civil Defense, and hospitals, 
as well as ambulances, arrived to evacuate the persons who were 
in the buildings and to try to control the situation in downtown 
Bogota, which was immersed in hectic activity as it is everyday. 
  The authorities have confirmed that the explosion occurred 
when a gas truck was supplying gas to El Brasero Dorado 
Restaurant, at a time when -- this is being investigated -- a 
commercial establishment should not have been receiving gas. 
  Authorities have confirmed that both the driver of the 
vehicle that was supplying the gas as well as the vehicle are 
being held, pending an investigation by the Prosecutor General's 
Office. 
  We have the government subsecretary of the district, who 
will 
give us an official report at this time from downtown Bogota. 
Go ahead, Dr. Beltran. 
  [Beltran] At 1011 this morning when the Gas Sur Company was 
supplying gas to this establishment a bottled gas cylinder 
exploded, causing what you see here. The authorities of the 
Prosecutor General's Office have initiated the pertinent 
investigations. A last-minute report indicates that 26 persons 
were injured. All have been treated at various hospitals. We 
learned that nine are in the San Juan de Dios Hospital, seven in 
the San Pedro Clavel Hospital, two in the San Ignacio Hospital, 
and eight in the Samaritano Hospital. Fortunately nobody was 
killed, and the persons who were injured are not in serious 
condition. There is one, however, who is being given special 
treatment. 
  [Valderrama] Dr. Beltran, we want to clear up something that 
is important. Can gas be supplied at 1000 in the downtown part 
of the capital? 
  [Beltran] No. In fact there is a regulation issued by the 
city mayor that restricts the loading and unloading of bottled 
gas in downtown Santa Fe de Bogota. Necessarily, it is 
prohibited to engage in this type of activity from 1000 to 1100 
in the downtown part of the city. 
  [Valderrama] Thus, another irregularity is turned over to 
the 
Prosecutor General's Office, which is investigating why this gas 
truck was supplying gas in downtown Santa Fe de Bogota at 1000 
this morning. This has been a report from Jimenez and 4th 
Avenue, where there was an explosion today in the downtown part 
of the capital. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Attorney General Gustavo Arrieta by </F>
unidentified EL TIEMPO correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [EL TIEMPO] A month ago, you told this newspaper 
that the Attorney General's Office was not satisfied with the 
process [of drug traffickers' surrendering to justice] and also 
that you would withdraw from the process if your suggestions 
were not heeded. Do you continue to think this way? Why? 
  [Arrieta] I did not say I am dissatisfied with the process. 
Quite the contrary, I said it should be carried out but within 
certain legal and political parameters. One of them is, 
necessarily, the existence of a confession. Fortunately, this 
is what has happened, and today the Attorney General's Office, 
the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Republic, and the 
government of the Republic fully agree on this point, which has 
also been accepted by those who are to surrender. 
  Regarding the second point, the Attorney General's Office 
cannot withdraw from the process because its participation is 
determined by the law. However, we are thinking about the 
possibility of having somebody who is not the attorney general 
-- the deputy attorney general -- attend the preparatory 
meetings because it is not desirable to deplete our reserves in 
this type of situation. 
  [EL TIEMPO] The government hinted that the prosecutor 
general 
is being naive in this process and that the traffickers are 
trying to take advantage of this situation. Do you think this 
is so? 
  [Arrieta] I don't think the prosecutor is acting naively. I 
believe he has taken an eminently juridical position as 
corresponds to an organization that is part of the Judicial 
Branch. In this context, it is inevitable that the drug 
traffickers, who have excellent legal advisers, try to obtain 
all the benefits and take advantage of the loopholes and 
confusion in a criminal law that is confusing, profuse, and 
wordy. Confronted with such a situation, we all have the 
responsibility of trying to avoid abuses to or the improper use 
of the law. 
  The government has vast experience on this issue. The 
experience is based both on the accomplishments and the failures 
of the surrender policy. Furthermore, it handles, as 
corresponds to a government, a political dimension that causes 
it to be extremely cautious and sometimes biased. 
  That is why it is necessary for us, without being naive or 
radical, to join our knowledge and experiences. In other words, 
let us forget the "La Catedral syndrome" [referring to the 
scandal prompted by the late drug lord Pablo Escobar's escape 
from La Catedral maximum security prison in Envigado]. We have 
to learn from the past and move forward with responsibility and 
without fear. 
  [EL TIEMPO] You also told EL TIEMPO a month ago that the 
drug 
traffickers had made no concrete offer. Does this still hold 
true? What exactly has Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela offered? 
  [Arrieta] It is important that the country's expectations 
regarding this process be lowered. A few months ago we were 
told there would be massive surrenders and that drug exports 
would be eradicated. This, naturally, generated great hope, 
both for the public as well as for the government. 
Unfortunately, the Cali gentlemen changed their position and 
today only talk about the possible surrender of two persons, one 
of them relatively minor but the other one, Gilberto Rodriguez, 
of great importance because of his hierarchy in the so-called 
Cali Cartel. There is no longer talk about the eradication of 
drug trafficking but rather of a possible cooperation that could 
lead to new surrenders or to the gradual reduction of illegal 
activities. All this is important, naturally, but does not have 
the political or juridical relevance that the original offer 
had. That is why we should no longer talk about the Cali 
Cartel's surrender, but about the possible surrender of Gilberto 
Rodriguez. That is why I believe we have to lower expectations. 
  [EL TIEMPO] The discrepancies between the prosecutor general 
and the government are obvious. What is behind their positions? 
Will this situation obstruct the process? 
  [Arrieta] Discrepancies of form and substance among the 
three 
institutions involved are inevitable in a process such as this 
because the persons in charge of the government, the 
Prosecutor's Office, and the Attorney General's Office are 
autonomous and willful and sometimes they have different 
opinions about what best suits the country. What is important 
is that we, as responsible and sensible people, do everything 
possible to reconcile our positions and to work harmoniously 
because this is what suits Colombia. If this is not produced, 
then each one will have to perform his legal and constitutional 
functions according to his beliefs of what is best. 
  [EL TIEMPO] The North Americans have demanded a common 
position, and this does not exist. What will happen to the 
supplying of evidence? What will happen if they withdraw from 
the process? There is the impression that they are pressuring 
for "hardline" solutions and that they prefer captures to 
surrenders because they do not like the penalties (too light) 
that would be imposed in the case of surrenders. What can you 
tell us about this? 
  [Arrieta] Unfortunately, a tense atmosphere in the field of 
legal cooperation has emerged, and we have to overcome it 
because U.S. cooperation is of fundamental importance. But, 
regardless of how important this cooperation might be, it cannot 
be the soul of our policies nor can we depend entirely on it 
because legal cooperation cannot replace the efforts that must 
be made by our police, which are the ones that together with the 
Prosecutor General's Office, must gather the necessary evidence 
to prosecute drug traffickers. 
  About the North Americans' preferring capture to surrender, 
I 
believe this is something all Colombians prefer also. However, 
if there is no capture, then the second best alternative would 
be the surrender. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What has been the position of the Attorney 
General's Office on the issues of confessions, indulgence 
because of collaboration, and house arrests? 
  [Arrieta] My office has always maintained that confessions 
must be a necessary requirement, and not just any confession but 
solid, serious, and complete confessions in which the people and 
the court authorities may believe and as a basis for which 
sentences can be applied so that they do not engender impunity 
or demoralize the people. We have also insisted that 
collaboration must be significant, specific, and perceptible; 
that there must be a substantial delivery of assets; and that 
house arrests would apply only in exceptional cases, in minor 
cases. 
  [EL TIEMPO] It is evident that, while the prosecutor general 
wants the process to move on quickly, the government wants to 
include elements that take into consideration national and 
international interests that would make the process move slower. 
How do you think the process should go? 
  [Arrieta] This process has legal and political aspects, 
speaking in the broadest sense. One should not rush because we 
have learned from experience that if things are rushed, then 
errors are made. I also believe, though, that we all want the 
process to move as quickly as reasonably possible. I think that 
the Prosecutor General's Office now understands the government's 
concern and that the government now understands the problems of 
the prosecutor, and all of us know now that this process can 
move forward only if an interinstitutional effort is made and 
there is teamwork. 
  [EL TIEMPO] The role of mediator between the government and 
the Prosecutor General's Office has caused an ambivalent 
situation, in which the government accuses you of being the 
unconditional ally of the prosecutor. In addition, the 
Prosecutor General's Office argues that your stand is a 
reflection of that of the government. Where do you stand on 
this? 
  [Arrieta] Yes, that is all true, and if the Attorney 
General's Office has tried to mediate, it is not only because we 
believe that position is one of our duties, but because we also 
believe public skirmishes weaken institutions and undermine the 
credibility and the trust people have in those institutions. We 
must not forget that only criminals fish in these troubled 
waters. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Regarding the surrender of the three presumed 
Cali Cartel members in January, is your prediction coming true 
that the ambiguity of some articles of the new Penal Code might 
create conditions that favor impunity in some particular cases? 
  [Arrieta] I believe so because many of the articles were 
poorly drafted; have a confusing content and scope, and lend 
themselves to many interpretations. For the sake of preventing 
impunity, it is necessary that we wed our capabilities and 
efforts, act in a coordinated manner, and have the ability to 
stop any goals they will undoubtedly try to score. But, above 
all, criminals can only be sentenced when proof is available. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Related to the current controversy, what do you 
think about the remarks by the justice minister on the 
Prosecutor General's Office interpretation of Article 369E's 
scope. 
  [Arrieta] The Attorney General's Office respects, but does 
not completely agree with the justice minister's interpretation 
of Article 369E, nor with the implementation the prosecutor has 
given it by opening a formal investigation on these proceedings. 
It is obvious, at least to us, that Article 369E is related to 
the preceding articles that concern the granting of benefits. 
We believe that for Article 369E to be applicable, those who 
surrender must confess or collaborate, either in the proceedings 
pending against them or in new ones that are begun as a result 
of the surrender.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] Everything seemed to be going badly for the Liberal 
Party recently. Three weeks ago Carlos Lemos said the party was 
operating in a "maricona" [homosexual] manner. Two weeks ago, 
the glittery launch of Andres Pastrana's campaign was presented 
as the arrival of a new era in political marketing. A 
week ago, Carlos Lleras de la Fuente announced that he was so 
concerned about his party's fate that he had decided to submit 
his name as a presidential candidate. And two days later, Alvaro 
Gomez--the historic enemy of the Pastrana family--sealed the 
Conservative Party's unity with his endorsement of Andres. 
  This string of misfortunes for Ernesto Samper led many 
people 
to think that, as things were going, the next tenant of the Casa 
de Narino [presidential residence] was going to have a 
moustache. Andres Pastrana, with his gorgeous wife and two 
precious children, conveys the image of the perfect candidate 
about to win the hearts of the Colombian people as the leader of 
this new country. 
  In high-level social and business circles, the comment 
always 
seemed to be the same: "Even though I am a liberal, this time I 
am going to vote for Andres." In the Jockey Club of Bogota; in 
the Club Colombia of Cali, and in the Union in Medellin, all 
bets were on Pastrana. Ernesto Samper, who was traveling all 
over the country amidst considerable indifference, was perceived 
as a personality distorted by his managers; in 
addition, he was zigzagging ideologically between Fernando 
Botero's new right and the old left of Horacio Serpa Uribe. Many 
people were starting to announce his political demise. 
  What may have brought about Ernesto Samper's resurrection 
was 
a poll by the CNC [National Survey Center] published in all the 
media at the end of last week. The poll was paid for by Bavaria, 
which for the past 16 months has been financing periodic opinion 
polls on the presidential campaign. In the world of politics and 
journalism this polling is considered the best barometer of this 
election contest. All the polls done by the Bavaria brewery had 
always given the victory to Andres Pastrana over Ernesto Samper. 
The margin of victory varied, but not the position of the 
candidates. 
  But Bavaria is not the only organization doing polls. Other 
firms, like Opinion Publica [Public Opinion] and Napoleon Franco 
also conduct polls, and they all had something in common: 
Ernesto Samper never won. This was extremely difficult for 
Samper's campaign to explain. When he was ambassador to Madrid 
it could be argued that he was not in Colombia. After he 
returned, they could say he was not yet a candidate. But once he 
had actually begun his campaign swings from department to 
department, the advantage of Pastrana--who was not 
campaigning--was difficult to justify. And while that was when 
his rival was not saying a word, there was no guarantee that 
things would improve when Pastrana's campaign actually got 
started. For in addition to being very well financed, Pastrana's 
campaign has been designed and guided by the expert hand of Luis 
Alberto Moreno, who left the Ministry of Development to work on 
the Pastrana campaign. 
<H5>  A Rigged Poll? </H5>
  Against this backdrop, last week's Bavaria-CNC poll caused a 
real surprise. In one month the situation had dramatically 
turned around and Samper, instead of losing, was shown winning 
both the first and second rounds. The results in the first 
round: Samper, 38 percent; and Pastrana, 33. In the second 
round: Samper, 50; and Pastrana, 43. The poll was done between 3 
and 8 February, that is, the week immediately prior to the 
launch of Andres Pastrana. But although this factor was not 
taken into account, Samper's rebound was surprising. 
  As the poll was financed by Bavaria, a member of the Santo 
Domingo Group, there were insinuations that it might have been 
rigged, as this conglomerate has been somewhat cool toward 
Pastrana. Still, that suggestion was not persuasive. If they had 
financed polls for 16 months in which Samper lost and had openly 
published them, why perpetrate a hoax now? Moreover, Augusto 
Lopez--Bavaria's CEO--is a reliable man, and falsifying 
information for electoral purposes would be an extremely grave 
matter for such a conglomerate. In addition, the new regulations 
on polls would make any such manipulation difficult, as it could 
be easily detected. And finally, Carlos Lemoine and the CNC are 
putting their prestige on the line in backing the veracity of 
their forecasts. Therefore, even though there may have been some 
debate about the methodology--particularly by the 
Pastranists--the poll's validity could not be seriously 
challenged. 
  What conferred the most legitimacy to Samper's resurrection 
was not just the Bavaria poll. It was the fact that all the 
other polls done at that time and immediately after began to 
show the same results. Peter Hart's consulting firm, along with 
Napoleon Franco, both showed Samper the winner by an equal 
margin. And an EL TIEMPO poll published on Sunday also agreed. 
That unanimity demonstrated that, against all expectations, 
Ernesto Samper had managed to pull ahead of Andres Pastrana 
during the week preceding the official announcement of 
Pastrana's candidacy. Though it was very likely that the 
successful launch of the campaign of the New Democratic Force's 
candidate would give him a substantial boost, this does not 
necessarily mean the imminence of a Pastranist victory. What is 
clear is that Andres Pastrana would face a contender in the 
ring up to the final round. Ernesto Samper's 
strategists always expected Pastrana's best time to be the week 
following the start of his campaign; that is, right now. That 
was because of the publicity fanfare generated by a new 
campaign, the charisma of the candidate and his family, and 
Colombians' propensity to get enthusiastic about anything new. 
After that phase, though, Samper would have a lot going for him. 
First of all, his predictable victory in the Liberal Party 
primary would give him not only the image of a winner, but 
legitimacy as the sole candidate of liberalism. And this party, 
despite all its flaws, limitations, and frustrations, is still 
by far Colombia's majority party. 
  This factor means that the Liberal Party's sole candidate 
always has great chances of being elected, even though he may 
not be the favorite of the multitudes. That is how Gaviria, 
Barco, and Turbay all reached the presidency without being 
considered--when nominated--to have great mass appeal. Since 
1930 the Liberal Party has never lost an election when it was 
united. It lost when the party was split over Ospina Perez in 
1946 and Betancur in 1982. Obviously, things have changed. Now 
party affiliation is not as strong as it used to be, and new 
factors like the second election round have created unknowns. 
But if Ernesto Samper, the sole liberal candidate, loses the 
election, it would be the first such case in this century.

<H5>  Technical Polling Data </H5>
  Conducted by CNC. Financed by Bavaria, S.A. Sample size: 
7,550 persons over 18 who expressed their intention to vote in 
some of the elections in 1994. Group studied: representative 
sample of the population in urban areas of Colombia. Collection 
method: personal interviews conducted at respondents' homes. 
Date of collection: 3 February to 8 February 1994. Maximum error 
margin for total sample: 1.1 percent. The CNC is registered with 
the National Election Board. 
<H5>  Samper's Rebound </H5>
  The question, then, is: if things were going so badly for 
him 
just a month ago, why is he doing so well now? Especially 
running against Pastrana, a candidate with star quality, who so 
far has made no mistakes. There are two answers to this 
question. The first is purely and simply the party machinery. 
All the polls in which Samper lost were conducted when the 
congressional campaign in the departments had not yet caught 
fire. They barely got off the ground at the start of this year, 
and such is the force of the liberal machine that it is 
producing a snowballing effect for the candidate. 
  The last Bavaria-CNC poll on the Senate's composition shows 
that, of a total of 100 senators, it should have about 64 
liberals. All these liberal campaigns are putting in money and 
giving a strong boost that inevitably benefits Samper who, as 
people now know, will be the official candidate. Napoleon Franco 
attributes last month's surprising rebound to this factor. 
Pastrana may have more support in big cities and a considerable 
edge among the ruling class and young people. But in midsized 
and smaller towns, ordinary people continue to produce the 
votes. And in this area, the Liberal Party still outperforms its 
rivals. So when the polls are conducted in the four major 
cities, Pastrana wins; but when the polling universe is widened, 
then the Samperist forces appear. And now, with the elections 
drawing nearer, these forces are starting to make themselves 
felt. 
  Party machinery is not the only explanation. There is also 
the fact that Samper has defined himself ideologically, and so 
the election is growing more polarized. Pastrana's candidacy has 
become a candidacy of the center right, and Samper's is becoming 
a center left candidacy. Both men deny these labels, trying to 
disguise them with other words. Pastrana rejects the neoliberal 
tag and calls himself a centrist; Samper defines himself as a 
supporter of democratic capitalism and places himself in what he 
calls the social center. But the truth is that Pastrana is the 
candidate the farthest to the right since Alvaro Gomez. With the 
difference, of course, that what was considered 
reactionary is now considered in. He has 
bravely announced that he supports the policies of President 
Gaviria who, economically, has also been on the right, though he 
does not like the "neoliberal" label either. 
  Ernesto Samper at one time flirted a little with 
neoliberalism, trying to harmonize it with the Liberal Party's 
traditional positions. Then, finding that this strategy was 
leaving him high and dry, he decided to leave this space to 
Gaviria and Pastrana and return to the position that liberalism 
had historically occupied. He went to extremes, like allowing 
himself to be praised by people like Hernando Agudelo Villa, 
considered obsolete by contemporary economic thought, people who 
have upheld the same old economic line for 25 years. 
  All these decisions entail risks for Samper, especially now 
that the right is in fashion and the left has become taboo. But 
not differentiating himself from Pastrana and simply 
tagging along and continuing Gaviria's new capitalism 
held even greater risks. As Samper himself has said dozens of 
times in private, he wants to be more like Clinton than Bush. 
The strategy was to touch this traditional liberal fiber which 
historically has been able to mobilize the masses. 
<H5>  Left vs. Right </H5>
  The truth is that both Pastrana and Samper are moderates. 
Pastrana is shocked by the image of savage capitalism with which 
people are portraying him, but there are many Colombians who 
believe that market forces produce better results than state 
intervention. Particularly in the ruling class, where the 
Pastrana majority is well known. 
  And Samper is neither a populist nor a leftist. But he knows 
that Colombian workers, students, and unions believe that 
neoliberalism has produced excesses that need to be corrected. 
These views are not heard much in the social clubs, but they may 
be in the majority. His speeches do not mention the word 
"apertura" [trade liberalization], considered compulsory in the 
Pastrana group. Samper's key word is "jobs" which, though 
sounding somewhat trite, is the Colombian people's biggest 
concern right now. Ernesto Samper is using this traditional 
strategy, and the results are showing up in the polls. After 
waffling from side to side for years he has decided to play the 
liberal card. Today this card is much more to the center than to 
the left. But in any case, it is different from Andres 
Pastrana's neoliberal right. 
  Pastrana, though, is a formidable candidate. He has a great 
image and while by no means an intellectual, he is ideologically 
consistent. In handling the media he is infinitely superior to 
Samper; therefore, defeating him is not going to be easy. But 
the liberal candidate still has two aces up his sleeve: the 
party leadership and the vice presidency. When he is proclaimed 
the official candidate, the selection of these two posts will 
allow Ernesto Samper to give an image of renewal to the party. 
This "makeover" may manage to persuade many a skeptical liberal 
that it is better to be disciplined and loyal to the party. And 
as 50 percent of the voters are now liberals, compared with 25 
percent who are conservatives, if Ernesto Samper can mobilize 
his party, his victory is highly probable. 
  To mobilize liberals, they must be made enthusiastic. And 
the 
truth is that even though the machinery is running at full 
speed, there are still signs of lack of interest. The party 
image is a little out of fashion and modernizing it is 
essential. Former President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala, as the 
party's sole leader, has been conciliatory and effective. But 
his image--although venerable and respected--evokes other eras. 
The image of Samper himself is not the best. While he is barely 
over 40 and comes from the private sector, he has been perceived 
as an old-style politician. This image contrasts with that of 
Pastrana, the perfect product for a marketing 
director. 
  But when Ernesto Samper emerges as the winner of the Liberal 
Party primary he is going to be running the show, and he may be 
able to bring about a change enabling him to turn this situation 
around. As the winning candidate, he can become the sole leader 
of his party--as the tradition has been in the past--or delegate 
this function to people who symbolize the new times. 
  The selection of his vice president will also be a message 
of 
the changes the Liberal Party will have to make upon reaching 
the 21st century. Names like Carlos Lleras de la Fuente, Juan 
Manuel Santos, and Pedro Gomez have been mentioned in different 
contexts for the concluding phase of the campaign. 
  Some strategic decisions of this nature may radically change 
the profile of liberalism and of its candidate in the final 
stretch. In a little while, Ernesto Samper will hold in his 
hands the ability to bring about this shakeup. If he does, he 
will be elected. 
<H5>  The Truth of the Polls </H5>
  The years go by, and Colombians are still skeptical about 
polls. For the experts, the reality is very simple. Polls for 
the Senate and Chamber are not very reliable because of the 
number of candidates running. The polls for presidential 
candidates, when properly done, are reliable. It is almost 
impossible for them to be in error. This is because it is one 
thing to ask questions for three or four names, as in 
presidential elections, and something else for 300 or 400, as in 
parliamentary elections. 
  Reservations about the methodology used in the poll released 
last week showing Ernesto Samper ahead are based on a single 
point: the inclusion or noninclusion of undecided voters. All 
pollsters in Colombia agree on two points. The first: of the 
people who intend to vote in the next election, Ernesto Samper 
is ahead of Andres Pastrana. The second; people who do not know 
if they are going to vote or not tend to prefer Pastrana. 
Therefore, a poll's final results depend on which percentage is 
attributed to these undecideds. The Bavaria-CNC poll lists 11 
percent classified as independents. LA PRENSA criticized this as 
very low, arguing that independents in Colombia are at about 45 
percent. However, Napoleon Franco, a polling rival of Carlos 
Lemoine, believes that the 11 percent of independents included 
as certain or probable voters in the Bavaria poll is a 
reasonable figure.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  Samper Attacks Pastrana's Economic Proposals </H6>
  During an 11 February campaign visit to Manizales, Liberal 
Party presidential hopeful Ernesto Samper said he was pleased 
that Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana 
has formalized his candidacy, but he characterized Pastrana's 10 
February speech outlining his campaign platform as "short on 
ideas and proposals." According to a 12 February report in EL 
ESPECTADOR, Samper said whomever is elected in May will have the 
"immense responsibility" of pushing forward the economic reforms 
undertaken by "recent Liberal governments," and, more important, 
of ensuring that those reforms benefit all Colombians. Samper, a 
former Minister of Development, said Colombians have two clear 
choices: the "savage capitalism" proposed by Pastrana that would 
mean "returning to the past with the model of Reagan and 
Thatcher," or Samper's proposal of "social capitalism" with a 
"human face." 
  According to Samper, Pastrana is "keeping strangely silent" 
with regard to unemployment and underemployment, which Samper 
described as the "most serious" problem affecting Colombians, 
especially women and youth. Samper reminded his audience that, 
just days earlier, he had presented a "serious and concrete 
plan" for creating 1.5 million "new, and better jobs." He also 
attacked Pastrana's proposals to address problems in the 
agricultural sector, saying Pastrana has in effect told farmers 
he will "abandon them to their fate" in the face of unfair 
competition from industrialized countries. Samper said he is 
offering a comprehensive plan of renewal for that sector, which 
could include "granting subsidies such as other countries do." 
With regard to social welfare spending, Samper said Pastrana is 
offering the "old style of assistance of the past" in contrast 
to his own proposal for a "comprehensive and modern social 
policy" that will "lift half of the Colombian population out of 
poverty," and increase productivity. According to EL ESPECTADOR, 
Samper further asserted that Pastrana's platform made no mention 
of increasing the availability of housing, in contrast to his 
own plan which promises to provide additional housing for 
500,000 families. 
  Pastrana rejected Samper's criticism of his economic 
program, 
according to a 13 February report in EL ESPECTAD0R, adding that 
"one should never give an opinion on something about which one 
knows nothing. I don't know if Dr. Samper has taken lessons in 
speed reading to be able to read, in a single night, the 
270-page program that I am proposing for the country." (Santa Fe 
de Bogota EL ESPECTAD0R 12 Feb 94 p 5-A; 13 Feb 94, 12-A) 
<H5>  Navarro on Minimum Wage Increase, Pastrana Candidacy </H5>
  While campaigning in Cesar Department, Democratic 
Alliance/M-19 presidential candidate Antonio Navarro Wolff told 
a crowd of some 2,000 persons that, if elected, he will raise 
the minimum wage by 30 percent in 1995 if inflation remains at 
the level of recent years. Navarro said this would restore the 
purchasing power of the minimum wage which, according to 
Navarro's estimates, has fallen 7 percent during the Gaviria 
Administration alone. 
  During an 11 February speech in Cucuta, Navarro said 
Pastrana's seven-point platform contained "nothing new," 
according to EL TIEMPO, and he described the Conservative Party 
candidate as "more Gavirist than Gaviria." At another campaign 
rally, Navarro said Pastrana's platform offered no "in-depth" 
proposals for addressing the country's "three historic 
challenges": an end to violence; treating social justice as a 
priority; and renewal of the government, freeing it from 
"clientelism and corruption." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO 9 
Feb p 7A; 12 Feb p 9A) 
<H5>  Women's Group Announces Support for Samper </H5>
  The 70-thousand member National Association of Indigenous 
and 
Peasant Women (ANMUSIC) has announced its support for Ernesto 
Samper and has asked him to consider selecting Cecilia Lopez 
Montano, former director of the Social Security Institute, as 
his vice presidential candidate. ANMUSIC director Leonora 
Castano is the second on the Senate list headed by Fernando 
Botero Jaramillo. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO 9 Feb 94 p 6A) 
<H5>  Samper Addresses Organized Labor Concerns on Privatization </H5>
  In a letter to the president and secretary general of the 
United Workers Central [CUT] outlining the advantages and 
disadvantages of privatizing state enterprises, Ernesto Samper 
said the process should not consist in "leaving a public 
monopoly in order to enter into a private monopoly" according to 
EL TIEMPO. Samper made the comments in response to a letter from 
the two CUT leaders in which they expressed their opposition to 
Samper's proposal to privatize Telefonos de Bogota (ETB) in 
order to finance construction of a metro system in Bogota. The 
labor leaders said such a move would serve to "concentrate 
wealth, widen the gap between rich and poor, and threaten the 
democratic system," according to the article. 
  In his response, Samper said that such "blind opposition" to 
privatization is "as reproachable" as attempting to use 
privatizations as "a panacea to cure all the ills and 
deficiencies of the state," the article states. He said further: 
  "It's time, dear friends, to begin thinking in a different 
way. I am convinced of the importance of union representation in 
democracies, but the role of unions in a modernization process, 
such as Colombia is experiencing, cannot be that of becoming a 
permanent obstacle to the processes of change that are 
inevitable." 
  Samper said the role of organized labor, like that of the 
business associations, is to be committed to improving the 
competitiveness "of our domestic industry in view the common 
challenge we face from foreign competition." (Santa Fe de Bogota 
EL TIEMP0 9 Feb 94 p 6A) 
<H5>  Polls Gauge Lleras de la Fuentes's Likely Showing in Primary </H5>
  A poll conducted 17-18 February by Invamer-Gallup at the 
request of SEMANA magazine show that Carlos Lleras de la Fuente, 
who recently announced his intention to compete for the Liberal 
Party presidential candidacy in the 13 March primary, would 
receive about 8 percent of the vote. When asked to identify the 
Liberal Party contender for whom they would vote in the primary, 
50.8 percent said they would vote for Ernesto Samper, 13.3 said 
they favored Humberto de la Calle, 8.4 were for Carlos Lemos, 
followed by Carlos Lleras de la Fuente, 8.2; Gloria Gaitan, 2.4 
and David Turbay, 2.0. 
  The poll was conducted by telephone. Results are based on 
responses from 1000 persons, residents of the four largest 
cities, who said they were likely to vote in the primaries. A 
5-percent margin of error was reported. 
  In a poll conducted 15-16 February by the National 
Consulting 
Center (CNC) and reported in EL ESPECTAD0R, 13 percent of 
respondents said they would vote for Lleras de la Fuente in the 
primary, compared with 41 who said they would vote for Samper, 
10 for De la Calle, 4 each for Lemos and Turbay, and 2 for 
Gonzalez. No information on polling methodology was reported.

<H5>  Effect of Gomez's Support of Pastrana Noted </H5>
  The National Consulting Center conducted a poll on 16 
February at the request of Noticiero CM&amp; to gauge the impact 
of 
Alvaro Gomez Hurtado's announcement of support for Conservative 
Party candidate Andres Pastrana. Gomez Hurtado is leader of the 
National Salvation Movement faction of the Conservative Party. 
When asked whether they felt more, less, or equally inclined to 
vote for Pastrana after Gomez's endorsement, 24 percent said 
they were more inclined; 12 percent said equally inclined, and 
14 percent were less inclined, while 44 said they never had an 
inclination to vote for Pastrana, before or after Gomez's 
announcement. 
  Poll results are based on a random telephone sample of 250 
persons in the four major cities, with a 6.2 percent margin of 
error reported. (Santa Fe de Bogota SEMANA 22 Feb 94 p 21) 
<H5>  Poll Shows Samper Leading Pastrana </H5>
  A 11-13 February poll conducted by the Washington firm, 
Peter 
Hart and Company, after Andres Pastrana's official announcement 
of his candidacy showed Ernesto Samper leading Pastrana by a 
7-point margin. When asked for whom they would vote, 39 percent 
of the respondents said Ernesto Samper, 32 percent said 
Pastrana, 10 percent were for Antonio Navarro, followed by 5 
percent for Miguel Maza Marquez, 3 percent for Enrique Parejo, 
and 2 percent for Rodrigo Marin Bernal. 
  Poll results, reported by radio station RCN, are based on 
direct interviews with 515 individuals selected at random and 
represent various social classes. Only those persons expressing 
a high degree of certainty that they would vote were 
interviewed. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL ESPECTADOR 19 Feb 94 p 5A) 
<H5>  Pastrana Says Peace is Necessary for Job Creation </H5>
  Campaigning in Bolivar Department, Andres Pastrana said that 
his government will create more than 1.5 million new jobs, but 
it is first necessary to reduce the level of violence in the 
country, according to EL ESPECTADOR. Pastrana reportedly said: 
  "The first thing we have to do is to guarantee life, the 
fundamental right of all human beings, because it is logical and 
irrefutable that, in order to work, we must be alive," according 
to the article. 
  Recalling the peace and prosperity he had found in the 
region 
while traveling there several years earlier, he contrasted it 
with the present climate of fear, saying people are clamoring 
for a return to normalcy in the countryside. (Santa Fe de Bogota 
EL ESPECTADOR 21 Feb 94 p 5B) 
<H5>  Navarro Questions Samper, Pastrana Job Creation Plans </H5>
  Antonio Navarro has questioned the feasibility of proposals 
by Ernesto Samper and Andres Pastrana to create 1.5 million or 
more new jobs if they are elected, according to EL TIEMPO. 
Navarro said studies conducted by economic researcher Eduardo 
Sarmiento show that, with the "apertura" [economic 
liberalization] program in full swing, it would be impossible to 
create that many jobs, according to the article. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota EL TIEMPO 24 Feb 94 p 6A)

  [Text] Agents from the Prosecutor General's Office and the 
Bogota Metropolitan Police yesterday uncovered an ELN [Army of 
National Liberation] plan to form a popular militia group in 
southern Bogota to meddle in the business sector and spread 
their ideological work. 
  Authorities raided a home in Las Delicias neighborhood where 
they reportedly found several pamphlets urging cooperation with 
the rebels and planning intimidation and extortion projects for 
various area businessmen. Seemingly, the ELN militia in Bogota 
would try to force people to contribute money, which would 
guarantee their security." [no beginning quotation mark as 
published] Three people were arrested in the operation, in 
addition to the seizure of Venezuelan arms and ammunition, as 
well as the pamphlets. 
  Authorities increased operations to try to break up the ELN 
plan and at the same time guarantee the fulfillment of a 
proposal by Ciudad Bolivar militias, who offered to demobilize 
and get their members to rejoin civilian life the way militias 
have been negotiating in Medellin.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Energy and Mines Minister Guido </F>
Nule Amin by Dario Arizmendi; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" 
newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Arizmendi] Mr. Minister, is the Colombian 
Government going to reverse itself in its negotiating process 
with the Cuban Government about the possibility of selling fuel 
to Castro's island beginning in June, as you suggested to 
Caracol a few weeks ago? 
  [Nule] Good morning, Dario. The situation is as follows: We 
are continuing the same process that we explained a few weeks 
ago following our visit to the island. The negotiations 
continue; we expect that there is a possibility of selling to 
the island between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil daily 
beginning in July, [as heard] but this is subject to 
negotiations, analyses, and evaluations of the terms of these 
negotiations; that is, a review of purely trade terms, which is 
a guarantee that Ecopetrol [Colombian Petroleum Enterprise] 
usually requests. The process continues. No contract has been 
signed yet. We have clarified this already, but the 
negotiations continue, and we may or may not reach an agreement. 
  [Arizmendi] Mr. Minister, won't the boycott that Miami 
Cubans 
announced make the Colombian Government reverse itself on the 
possibility of exporting oil and other oil products? 
  [Nule] No, we have not thought about it. Personally, I think 
this would be very serious, because it would mean subjecting any 
commercial activity [peticion], in this case a commercial 
activity of the country, to pressure by a very respectable 
group. [sentence as heard] I believe, however, that this is 
not the way to proceed. Among other reasons, this type of 
negotiation with the island has also been held with many other 
countries that maintain embassies in and business with the 
United States, and there have been no reprisals. I do not see 
why there would be reprisals against Colombia, nor do I see why 
Colombia would have to change its trade policies due to, I 
repeat, pressure from a group, regardless of how respectable it 
might be. 
  [Arizmendi] The front page of EL TIEMPO newspaper today, Mr. 
Minister, carries a report stating that the Simon Bolivar 
National Guerrilla Coordinating Board was in Havana at an 
intercontinental summit that was also reportedly attended by a 
diplomat, a bishop, other prominent personalities of the 
continent, and of course, from Colombia, persons who have been 
part of subversion. Would this fact, if proven, stop the 
negotiation process with Cuba? 
  [Nule] I do not know, Dario. We at the Mines and Energy 
Ministry deal with nonpolitical issues, much less with foreign 
policy. We know that we have diplomatic ties with Cuba, and 
this allows our trade relationship and do not understand why it 
cannot be. If there is any inconvenience, we will be 
appropriately notified in due time, but I do not think it is.... 
[pauses] besides, I am neither aware of this nor is this among 
my responsibilities. 
  [Arizmendi] According to the estimates of the ministry you 
head, Energy and Mines Minister Guido Nule Amin, how much fuel 
would Colombia sell to Cuba during the second half of the year 
should the negotiations materialize? 
  [Nule] Should negotiations materialize, we would be talking 
about some 15,000 to 20,000 barrels of oil per day. We need to 
multiply this by a price that could be between $14 and $15 per 
day [figures as heard]; that is, we could be talking about some 
$5 million per month.

<F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle by </F>
"24 Horas" program anchorman Bernardo de la Maza at the 
Television Nacional de Chile studios on 9 March -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [De la Maza] The Codelco 
[Copper Corporation] case has undoubtedly tarnished the last 
days of President Aylwin's administration. Will it influence 
the start of yours? 
  [Frei] It is a national problem. It does not involve an 
administration, it involves our country and it must be solved. 
  Apart from the proceedings to resolve this case -- which are 
being handled by the courts, the office of the comptroller 
general, the state defense council, and the Chamber of Deputies 
-- the country is interested in our future actions. 
  We want to establish a very strong modernization process. We 
have already begun by not appointing an executive vice 
president: Each managing director will be responsible for his 
area. 
  When formed, we will announce the new board of directors. We 
will announce it when the new Codelco executive officers are 
appointed. We will very strongly encourage the modernization of 
this company, which is a key company in the country. 
  [De la Maza] When one views what happened in Codelco, one 
believes it maybe is without solution. It apparently involves a 
man who -- acting wrongly -- took the money of Chileans and -- 
in a nutshell -- speculated on the international markets and 
lost more than $200 million in just a few weeks. What can be 
done to prevent this type of action? 
  [Frei] I believe there must be a control system. Every 
company in the world ... [changes thought] I am also an 
entrepreneur, I have worked for many years in private companies. 
There was no control. We must find out why there was no 
control. 
  Within the modernization process, we must clearly establish 
responsibilities and ensure that control is applied every day. 
  [De la Maza] It has been said recently that no one will pay 
for this loss, that Chileans will not have to pay it because 
there was some reserve money. Do you agree? 
  [Frei] If Codelco receives less money in the next few years 
as future transactions are completed, it is obvious that Chile 
will receive less money. 
  [De la Maza] So all Chileans will have to pay for this loss 
in some way. 
  [Frei] Exactly. 
  [De la Maza] It has also been said that the Codelco case 
negated the idea of loyal and constructive opposition to the 
administration of President Patricio Aylwin. Do you agree? 
  [Frei] I do not. I have spoken with members of the 
opposition. I invited the presidents of the two main opposition 
parties, Andres Allamand [National Renewal] and Jovino Novoa 
[Independent Democratic Union], to dine at my house. We met 
when I was elected president. We will work together because I 
believe a president must deal with national issues and should 
always seek agreement on national issues. We may have different 
view points and disagreements, but there are national issues 
with which we must deal. As president I will deal with them 
from the national point of view. Regarding the opposition, I 
would like it to be loyal and constructive; an opposition that 
states its differences. In a democratic system it is good to 
have a rotation of governments, opposition, and control; and 
that is the task of the opposition. 
  [De la Maza] Do you expect disloyal opposition over the 
Codelco case? 
  [Frei] No. Of course, in a process as complex as the Codelco 
case some people may make inappropriate comments. This is part 
of our popular tradition but I believe the investigation must 
continue. 
  [De la Maza] As of next Monday you will be the president in 
La Moneda Palace. Among the measures you will be unable to 
adopt is that of removing the Army commander [General Augusto 
Pinochet]. As a democrat how do you feel, faced with this 
situation? 
  [Frei] From the point of view of principles -- as I have 
always said -- I would like the president to have that right. 
But I respect the Constitution and the laws because this is a 
process we started in 1988. We will continue it because , as we 
always said, this is how we would do it, this is how we did it, 
and this is one of the successful aspects of the transition. 
  [De la Maza] Will you suggest to General Pinochet that he 
leave the Army Command? 
  [Frei] He has the constitutional right to remain in his post 
until 1997. As of 11 March, following my inauguration, ours 
will be a relationship appropriate between the president of the 
Republic and the Army commander. 
  [De la Maza] The fact that this situation continues -- a 
situation that does not fully coincide with a democratic regime, 
along with the situation of appointed senators, etc. -- do you 
believe the transition is not fully completed? 
  [Frei] I believe -- as pointed out in the 1989 program -- 
that some tasks were established for the transition and some 
were established for the next government. Some were not 
fulfilled, but we hope to fulfill them during my administration, 
including those mentioned. These tasks should be fulfilled 
within a framework of agreement, because under those conditions 
laws and agreements are permanent and no government will attempt 
to change them. We will work on those tasks under that spirit. 
  [De la Maza] Regarding this and other political reforms, 
such 
as the electoral law, do you like to move fast or slow? 
  [Frei] In the appropriate manner because the people are 
waiting to see how we will solve their real problems, how we 
will work on issues such as poverty, education, health, 
environment, and social security -- the big issues. 
  [De la Maza] Will you move faster on those issues? 
  [Frei] These issues will have priority. This does not mean 
we will forget other issues. Every issue will be dealt with at 
the appropriate time. On 21 May [opening of Congress] I will 
clearly point this out. 
  [De la Maza] How can the people interpret your decision to 
appoint a socialist as interior minister? 
  [Frei] I would say this shows the full consolidation of 
democracy and that nothing is prohibited for any Chilean. 
  [De la Maza] As a former businessman -- you are known as a 
businessman -- do you believe capitalism is cruel to the poor. 
  [Frei] Obviously, and this is what we have been trying to 
change in this country. In only a few countries has it been 
shown that accelerated development is compatible with social 
justice and equity. This is what we have been working on during 
the last few years. We need investments and efficiency to 
overcome poverty, but we also need a real effort because, as I 
have said many times in the interior, many Chileans live in 
conditions similar to the most developed countries in the world, 
while near us many live in misery. From the point of view of 
ethics and solidarity, I believe we can and should make an 
effort. My government will make an effort. 
  [De la Maza] President Aylwin provided aid, will you 
increase 
it or do you feel it is sufficient? 
  [Frei] I believe we can increase it because the country is 
in 
a different condition than when Aylwin received the government 
in 1989. Agreement has been reached on taxes which allows to 
spend more on social issues. I will also propose from the 
beginning of my administration -- perhaps make it the number one 
priority of my government -- that the struggle against poverty 
should be a national issue, not just for the government but for 
all sectors of the country. We will invite all sectors -- 
workers and businessmen -- to a great national crusade against 
poverty. In my speech on 12 March, I will announce that I will 
preside over the ministers social committee, emphasizing from 
the beginning the priority issues of our administration.

  [Text] Four political prisoners that have been pardoned by 
President Patricio Aylwin are in a tense calm, awaiting official 
notification of his decision. 
  The four men, accused of having participated in the attack 
against General Augusto Pinochet in 1986, are in Santo Domingo 
Prison, tensely awaiting official notification of their pardon. 
They were pardoned yesterday by President Aylwin, a decision 
about which they have not yet been officially notified. 
  [Begin Alberto Espinoza, lawyer for the pardoned inmates, 
recording] I know nothing besides what has been published in the 
newspapers or broadcast on radio. This morning I spoke with 
Justice Ministry officials, and they did not tell me anything 
about the resolution. [end recording] 
  The four inmates pardoned by the president are Hector 
Figueroa, Oscar Ordenes, Hector Maturana, and Miguel Angel 
Colima, the latter having been sentenced for participating in 
the attack against the Los Quenes Police Garrison in 1988. The 
four men could travel to Belgium, but this has still not been 
confirmed. 
  The Army is distressed, Army Deputy Commander Lieutenant 
General Jorge Lucar said upon learning of the president's 
decision to pardon the terrorists who participated in the attack 
against Gen. Pinochet. 
  [Begin Lucar recording] Our institution is distressed in 
light of the sacrifice, the murder, of four of its members and a 
Carabinero. We are faced with a presidential decision, and the 
Army will always obey the decisions of the government, without a 
doubt. [end recording] 
  [Begin Brigade General Fernando Torres, Army prosecutor 
general, recording] Regrettable. The more so when we all know 
the manner in which these people acted. It was a premeditated, 
open attack. Armed Forces men were murdered in cold blood. It 
was a frustrated attack against the president of the Republic, 
which is a very serious thing. [end recording] 
  Regarding the moment chosen by the president of the Republic 
to grant the pardon, Gen. Torres said: 
  [Begin Torres recording] It took him a long time because he 
had doubts for some time about the fairness of this decision. 
[end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Carmen Castro at the Foreign Ministry] </F>
  [Text] Chilean Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma today 
fully justified the Chilean vote condemning human rights 
violations in Cuba. The Chilean Government adopted two 
positions, probably in an attempt to seek a fair position on the 
Cuban situation when this issue was raised again at the annual 
session of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva. A 
resolution condemning human rights violations in Cuba was issued 
during this session. This initiative was approved by 24 votes to 
nine, while 20 abstained from voting. 
  The UN commission pointed out the need to observe freedom of 
the press and association in Cuba. The U.S.-sponsored resolution 
was supported by the Chilean Government, which stated, however, 
that the economic blockade of Cuba should not have been allowed. 
In this regard, Silva Cimma said: 
  [Begin recording] [Silva Cimma] You should not only report 
that Chile voted against human rights violations in Cuba, but 
that Chile backed the Cuban request to condemn the unilateral 
support for the blockade. 
  [Unidentified reporter] This means that Chile has adopted 
different positions on the economic blockade of Cuba and on the 
human rights situation. 
  [Silva Cimma] Merely because... No, not about the human 
rights situation, but human rights violations. We believe that 
unilateral blockades are very harmful, and that human rights 
must be protected worldwide 
  [Reporter] Minister, does Chile concur with the special 
rapporteur's report on systematic human rights violations in 
Cuba? 
  [Silva Cimma] It would be an open lack of respect to 
question 
a report by a human rights rapporteur. For many years we have 
demanded respect and positive votes for the rapporteur's reports 
on human rights in Chile. We continue supporting this position. 
[end recording] 
  Silva Cimma said Chile is concerned about any human rights 
violations in Cuba. He specifically mentioned the right to life 
and to freedom for people. He said the substantial progress that 
has been made in Cuba in the social and health areas were 
admitted especially in Geneva, and that consequently it was not 
appropriate for the Rio Group to support the blockade of Cuba in 
that forum.

  [Excerpts] Future Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa 
on 24 February assessed the visit of U.S. Trade Secretary Mickey 
Kantor for the presidential inauguration as a U.S. Government 
sign that it favors a commercial relationship with Chile. 
  Figueroa commented: "I consider him a very important (U.S.) 
Government official. I also believe his visit is a sign that 
the U.S. Government favors the search for a significant 
commercial relationship with Chile, either through a free trade 
agreement or Chile's acceptance as a NAFTA member, which are, 
precisely, the subjects we are going to discuss here with the 
secretary." 
  Figueroa held a lengthy working meeting at the Diplomatic 
Academy with the outgoing and incoming Foreign Ministry director 
generals. [passage omitted] 
  The meeting's purpose, according to Figueroa, was to review 
all the ministry's tasks, exchange opinions regarding the 
ministry's general guidelines, and to discuss specific subjects. 
  Carlos Figueroa said some of the specific subjects raised 
during the meeting were Chile's bilateral policy and its 
relationship with neighboring countries and the European Union, 
as well as the rapprochement with Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South].

<F P=106> [Relay from Santiago, Chile, by Luiz Augusto Mendoca] </F>
  [Text] President Itamar Franco warned that those 
businessmen who try to sabotage the economic plan will be 
severely punished. 
  During a chat with journalists this evening, President 
Itamar 
Franco expressed his indignation over the price markups taking 
place throughout Brazil and asserted that the government must 
win the battle against price increases by any means. 
  Franco said that on 14 or 15 March the government will 
submit 
a draft bill to Congress containing very strict, severe 
sanctions on business people obstructing the economic plan. 
  The president, however, did not mention what type of 
sanctions the draft bill will contain. According to Franco, 
since Congress is also interested in doing away with constant 
price markups, he believes the draft bill might be approved 
expeditiously through an agreement with party leaders. 
  As for the abusive price increases, Franco asserted that 
talks with the business sector are not working, that the 
government holds talks democratically but despite these talks 
nothing happens, mentioning the pharmaceutical industry as an 
example. 
  Franco, who on 11 March will attend new Chilean President 
Eduardo Frei's inauguration, also talked about presidential 
succession and the rumor that Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso will be a candidate. Franco said Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso still has said absolutely nothing to him on whether or 
not he will be a candidate, and that it is up to him and his 
party, the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], to decide 
but that he, the president, does not know what the minister has 
in mind. 
  President Franco added that if necessary the minister can 
make a decision in 24 hours but that he still has time because, 
after all, the deadline to resign in order to run for elections 
does not expire until 2 April, which means the minister still 
has 20 days to decide. 
  Franco ended by stating that the president of the Republic 
is 
responsible for choosing the finance minister and that Minister 
Cardoso, in his capacity as a democrat, would never suggest 
anybody for the post. 
  Franco also commented that Congress' decision not to extend 
the deadline for those holding a public post who want to run for 
elections to resign will speed up the succession process. 
  Soon President Franco will be leaving for La Moneda Palace, 
where he will have dinner with outgoing Chilean President 
Patricio Aylwin.

  [Text] President Aylwin has promulgated the last law of his 
mandate: the three A's telecommunications law which, according 
to Transport and Communications Minister German Molina, will 
lower telephone fares. During a brief ceremony in the Camellia 
Garden at La Moneda Palace, Minister Molina pointed out the most 
important points of the new law. 
  [Begin Molina recording] This law introduces a contracted or 
dialed multicarrier system that will allow the public to choose 
the company with which they want to place their long distance 
calls, both national and international. This choice may be made 
from call to call, by dialing the identification code of the 
carrier the user chooses, or by signing a contract with a 
determined carrier to channel all their calls through that 
company. [end recording] 
  The law also establishes the obligatory interconnection of 
telecommunications networks, in the case of public services, and 
the mediating services offered by the long distance service. 
  [Begin Molina recording] Another important step taken by 
this 
law is the adoption of measures facilitating the modernization 
of the telephone networks, which will mean cheaper telephone 
fares. 
  The telecommunications development fund plays an important 
role in giving the entire public access to telephone services, 
in that it includes low income users whom market laws did not 
accommodate. Despite this important step there still remain 
pending tasks, like strengthening the government's ability to 
control and establish norms in order to surmount the imbalance 
existing between the regulating agency and the regulated 
companies. This is therefore a pending challenge for the 
incoming administration. [end recording] 
  Molina recalled the difficulties in approving this bill, 
mainly as a consequence of litigation among the telephone 
companies, which were overcome thanks to the support of 
everyone. After the ceremony President Aylwin did not wish to 
speak with the media.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Chile monitored through 10 
March. 
  The Spanish Hispano Central Bank invested $23 million in 
Chile with the purchase in October 1993 of 11.2 percent of the 
Bank of Santiago's shares. This bank thus continues the local 
expansion that began in June 1993 with the purchase of 50 
percent of the shares of the O'Higgins Bank, which is controlled 
by the powerful local Luksic group. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2114 
GMT 24 Feb 94) 
  The Consumer Prince Index increased 0.3 percent in February. 
Transportation, telecommunications, and housing were the items 
that registered the highest increase. Accrued inflation so far 
this year is 1.4 percent. Wholesale prices grew 0.2 percent in 
February. The unemployment rate in the period from November to 
January stood at 4.8 percent, a 0.3 percent increase compared 
with the same period in the previous year. (Santiago Television 
Nacional de Chile Imagen Internacional in Spanish 1700 GMT 2 Mar 
94) 
  The Santiago Business Chamber reports that Chilean trade 
exchange during 1993 amounted to $20.172 billion, 3 percent more 
than in 1992. Exports, which dropped 7 percent in comparison 
with 1992, amounted to $9.416 billion, while imports, which 
increased 11.5 percent, were $10.63 billion. Thus, the trade 
deficit was $1.211 billion, the first negative balance in years. 
The trade deficit with the United States and Canada was $964 
million; Latin America, $589 million; Africa, $554 million; 
Oceania, $69 million; and the Middle East, $34 million. The 
biggest trade surplus was with Japan with $620 million; the 
United Kingdom, $340 million; Taiwan, $222 million; the 
Netherlands, $172 million; and Bolivia, $150 million. (Santiago 
Radio Cooperativa Network in Spanish 1000 GMT 7 Mar 94) 
  Production Development Corporation, Corfo, companies 
increased their profits 125 percent. These companies comprise 
the regional sanitary companies; the National Coal Enterprise, 
Enacar, and its subsidiaries Iscar and Cardile; the Colpun, 
Edelnor, and Eneaisen electricity companies; the Sofri free 
zone; the subway company; and the soccer pool. Corfo manager 
Gustavo Silva said those companies earned profits of 19.75 
billion pesos. He added that the historical average investment 
rate in sanitary works tripled during 1993. (Santiago Radio 
Cooperativa Network in Spanish 1000 GMT 9 Mar 94)

  [Text] Former APRA [American Popular Revolutionary 
Alliance] Secretary General Luis Alva Castro acknowledged that 
there is a real crisis in his party, admitting also that many 
mistakes were made during the administration of Alan Garcia. 
  He said, however, that the crisis is not affecting the APRA 
alone, but, in general, all parties in Peru and the rest of the 
world. "As far as we are concerned, enormous efforts are being 
made to make renewed and updated proposals that can convey a 
message of hope to people," he said. 
  As for the mistakes made during the APRA government, he said 
that despite this, it should be admitted that there were major 
achievements like decentralization, which produced the 
democratization and transformation of the state, giving towns 
the opportunity to independently build their own future. 
  He said: "Unfortunately, all this has been left behind 
because we are a country in which centralism prevails." 
  In this regard, Alva Castro said the future and history will 
make a much more accurate balance, without either annoyance or 
passion. 
  "Let us allow the party and its leaders to build the future 
for the consolidation of this institution so that it will 
continue to contribute with its experience to the country's 
sociopolitical development," he said. 
  He explained that APRA still has political weight in the 
country, and that the clearest proof of this was seen on 18 
February on the occasion of the meeting for the Day of APRA 
Solidarity. 
  "The party has social power, and it is fully convinced that 
its leaders and members will join efforts to find a renewed 
image. That is why we will participate in the 1995 elections. We 
will choose a presidential candidate later," Alva Castro said. 
  Concerning former President Alan Garcia's new work as 
novelist, he said he has the right to use his knowledge, talent, 
and capacity in literature. "This occurs because Alan has 
decided to stay far from the current national situation," he 
said.

  [Text] Retired General Jose Pastor Vives on 21 February 
said the "13 de Noviembre" Civic Movement has no political 
objectives and will dissolve after attaining its main objective, 
which is the freedom of retired General Jaime Salinas Sedo and 
the eight officers being held at the military prison in Real 
Felipe fortress, serving their sentences for a November 1992 
coup attempt. 
  He said the organization is trying to gather 50,000 
signatures all over the country to endorse an amnesty bill 
within the framework of the popular legislation mechanism 
Congress is debating. 
  Pastro Vives categorically emphasized that the movement is 
exclusively of a civic nature and that it has no other political 
objectives. He added: "Gen. Salinas has no political ambitions, 
as he himself explained on several occasions." 
  He explained, however, that Salinas can make his own choice 
after being released and that the organization has nothing to do 
with it. 
  For his part, Salinas' lawyer, Javier Valle-Riestra, said 
during the presentation of the movement on 18 February -- and 
also in interviews that he granted to the media a few days later 
-- that Salinas might be a good presidential candidate for 1995.

  [Text] Lima, 9 Mar (EFE) -- A Peruvian Journalist 
Association (CPP) spokesman said on 9 March that some 30 
Peruvian journalists are prisoners in various Peruvian jails on 
charges of maintaining relations with terrorist groups. 
  A group of imprisoned reporters has decided to begin a 
protest hunger strike at the Campo Grande Lima prison, demanding 
that courts speed up the trials in which they are involved, a 
spokesman said. 
  The CPP official also denounced the case of journalist Juan 
Tuanama, a reporter for the weekly magazine JUNGLE of Tingo 
Maria, who remains in jail despite a judge's order to release 
him after being acquitted. Tuanama is accused of participating 
in various terrorist acts during the time he was in prison, the 
source said. 
  Other arrested journalists are charged with the crime of 
"advocating terrorism" because they worked at the newspapers EL 
DIARIO and CAMBIO, the newspapers of the Shining Path Maoist 
gang and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), 
respectively. 
  "They worked on those publications when the newspapers were 
legal leftist outlets and had nothing to do with the subversive 
groups who took over the newspapers afterward," the CPP 
spokesman said. 
  The official also reported that the Supreme Court annulled a 
lower court decision releasing journalists Alicia Figueroa and 
Gisela Gutarra and ordered that they be arrested again. 
  Imprisoned journalist Monica Palomo, who is five months 
pregnant, has been urgently sent to a Lima hospital due to a 
placenta detachment that is threatening to cause the abortion of 
her baby.

  [Text] Lima, 9 Mar (EFE) -- The Peruvian Foreign Ministry 
reported that the access of Peruvian fishing products to France 
has returned to normal levels. Today France included Peru on the 
list of countries authorized to export its products to the 
French market. 
  A Foreign Ministry press release reported today that the 
French official newspaper has published information directed to 
French importers of fishing products, incorporating Peru on the 
list of nations authorized to sell them their products. 
  The note adds that the French Government has fulfilled the 
administrative requirement of including Peru on the list of 
countries permitted to export to their market, as it committed 
itself on 24 February when it announced it would do so "as soon 
as possible." 
  On that date, a Peruvian Foreign Ministry note reported that 
French authorities had communicated to the Peruvian Government 
that they were taking the necessary steps to fulfill the 
administrative requirements for publication of the list of 
accepted Peruvian firms. 
  The French Government said on that occasion that "there is 
no 
discrimination" affecting Peruvian fishing products' entry into 
the French market. 
  On 22 February, it was reported in Lima that France had 
forbidden the importation of Peruvian hake as a result of French 
unions' protests demanding protective measures from their 
government.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Peru monitored through 10 
March. 
  The "Peru Textile Fair" ended very successfully in Tokyo, 
Japan. Several Peruvian textile industries displayed cotton and 
alpaca clothes, thus increasing the chance of exporting to 
Japan. The Peruvian industrialists representing 16 companies 
negotiated with Japanese wholesale importers, who were surprised 
at the quality of the products. A seminar also was sponsored as 
part of the fair in order to report on the characteristics of 
the Japanese textile market and to properly train Peruvians for 
future negotiations. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 24 Feb 94 p 2) 
  The Chinese Bank has agreed to a $40 million loan to support 
social projects being implemented by the government. President 
Fujimori noted that the Chinese credit is one of the most 
advantageous ever granted to Peru because the interest is much 
lower than that of international banks. He said China has 
granted to Peru $55 million in credits and $16 million in 
financial aid in the past 12 months. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 23 
Feb 94 p A6) 
  Several specialists told EXPRESO that the Peruvian foreign 
debt notes suddenly dropped from 72 percent to 65 percent last 
week because foreign investors reportedly are starting to 
evaluate the impact of the norms on the exchange of debt for 
privatization. Most believe that those who bought 70 percent of 
the debt notes made a bad investment because Peruvian debt notes 
will continue to drop in upcoming days. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 
24 Feb 94 p A24) 
  The National Institute of Statistics and Information Science 
reported that the February inflation rate in metropolitan Lima 
was 1.8 percent, raising the cumulative inflation rate for the 
year's first two months to 3.7 percent. The GDP rose 9.7 percent 
in January compared with the same month last year. (Lima EL 
COMERCIO in Spanish 2 March 94 p A1) 
  On 3 March, the Lima stock exchange hit a record $63.3 
million as a result of the successful privatization of the 
Peruvian Telephone Company, which sold 74 percent of its shares. 
(Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish 3 Mar 94 p B1) 
  The Special Privatization Committee reported that the 
government has decided to accept $60 million worth of Peruvian 
foreign debt notes in the privatization of the Central Peru 
Mining Enterprise. The base price for the sale of the company is 
$280 million. The name of the owner of 100 percent of the shares 
will be disclosed on 11 April. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 3 Mar 94 
p A23) 
  The Central Reserve Bank's net international reserves rose 
to 
$2.968 billion through 22 February, $182 million more than in 
late January. It has increased $267 million so far this year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Favaris Davietjarov, vice president of the </F>
Russian Rosnef company, by Borja Loma in Asuncion; date not 
given -- all names and titles as published] 
  [Text] [Loma] Please tell us why the Rosnef company has 
come to Paraguay? 
  [Davietjarov] I would like to say first that Paraguay is for 
us a new country. Our company is working in nearly every 
country in the world, except Paraguay. Second, we always 
thought Paraguay was a dictatorship like Russia was. We now 
know you are on the road to democracy and as we understand it, 
your government seeks to give the Paraguayan people a better, a 
more dignified life. This is what we want for our own people: a 
dignified life for all. You must know that Russia is one of the 
largest oil exporters in the world, but because some of our oil 
has run out, we have people looking for oil in different places. 
This is why we thought there may be oil in Paraguay. 
  [Loma] You know the Americans are already here looking for 
oil. 
  [Davietjarov] We know the Americans are looking for oil in 
Paraguay. We want to know what is happening here. We want to 
know exactly what the possibilities are here. This is our first 
contact. We also want to know about the relations you have with 
other oil companies. After that we will know what to do. This 
is only the start. We can be a good competitors for the 
Americans. We have good experts. Not everything that is 
American is necessarily better, especially regarding the first 
stages of prospecting for oil. We are the best at that. 
  [Loma] What is the role of Rosnef in the Russian economy? 
  [Davietjarov] Rosnef controls 70 percent of the Russian oil 
market, 65 percent of byproducts, and 65 percent of the sale of 
oil fields in the country. From the Russian map, you can see we 
control over 70 percent of the oil territory. It is a company 
that has more than 1 million workers [as published]. It 
controls over 55 percent of the oil business in Russia. I am 
the vice president of the consortium that used to belong to the 
state, which is now in the process of privatization. This 
process will conclude late this year. 
  [Loma] Could you tell us in what Latin American countries 
your company has commercial interests? 
  [Davietjarov] We have been in Cuba for a long time, 
supplying 
oil. In Venezuela we buy and sell oil. We also worked with 
various U.S. companies with interests in Latin America. We buy 
machinery and oil extracting equipment. 
  [Loma] You do not operate in many Latin American countries. 
  [Davietjarov] We work mostly with the Americans in this 
continent, especially with West-coast companies which deliver 
oil and byproducts to the East coast of Russia because it is too 
far to bring it through the European part of Russia. 
  [Loma] What is your opinion of the international oil market 
following the imbalances created by the Persian Gulf War, and 
the fall of the Communist system in your country and in Eastern 
Europe? 
  [Davietjarov] The market collapsed but our exports did not 
decrease. They remained at the same level. The international 
oil price dropped but this did not influence the Russian market. 
  [Loma] What role do you believe Paraguay could play in the 
international oil market? 
  [Davietjarov] Paraguay buys oil from Algeria. You must 
produce oil in your country if you are to influence the market. 
We believe that because Paraguay is located in the heart of 
South America it could become a good platform for exchanging 
Brazilian oil, for example, with Chile and other countries after 
the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] becomes operational. 
A big oil refinery could be built here to produce oil 
byproducts for neighboring countries. We met yesterday with 
Integration Vice Minister Fadlala and saw many positive points 
in the program he showed us. Paraguay can play a major role in 
the Mercosur even if no oil is found here. 
  [Loma] Will you look for oil here? 
  [Davietjarov] No, but we are ready. 
  [Loma] Ready, for what? 
  [Davietjarov] To meet with the minister and discuss the 
problems and possibilities. We will then make our offer. 
  [Loma] This delegation seems to be the most important to 
have 
arrived in the history of bilateral relations. Does this 
represent greater rapprochement between the two governments? 
  [Davietjarov] Our government program consists of maintaining 
good relations with all countries as well as integrating into 
the world and working in any country. We are not here only to 
carry out propaganda in our favor but also to learn. We have to 
learn the good things existing abroad. It would be a great 
pleasure for us to learn many things in Paraguay. 
  [Loma] During your first news conference, as soon as you 
arrived, you noted that you did not know much about Paraguay, 
but you would be interested in obtaining more information with 
the goal of establishing commercial channels. Have you learned 
anything significant yet? 
  [Davietjarov] This is the first time that we are meeting and 
become acquainted with the people here -- not only at the 
ministries, but also on the streets where we have talked with 
various pedestrians. We are becoming acquainted with the city 
and everything is going step by step. If you only meet 
ministers, you do not get much information. It is necessary to 
become acquainted with the people, and we are doing just that. 
  [Loma] Can you tell me if you have signed any political or 
economic agreement? 
  [Davietjarov] We have been here for a very short time. We 
have held and we will hold many meetings. We have presented our 
offers. I can only tell you again that we are ready. We hope 
our offers will be interesting for Paraguayan entrepreneurs and 
businessmen. We are ready to sign agreements. We have more than 
1 million people working in our consortium. We are sure some 
Paraguayan products will be of interest in Russia or at least 
for your consortium. 
  [Loma] According to assessments by various international 
observers, the political situation in Paraguay is not entirely 
stable at this moment. What would your enterprise do if the 
democratic process were discontinued here? 
  [Davietjarov] We are interested in good relations, 
especially 
economic ones, which should take place within an atmosphere of 
political stability. Nevertheless, I am sure that we, like any 
foreign company established here, can work well under any 
political system. Business is business. 
  [Loma] What was your perception of Paraguay while you were 
in 
Russia? What is the Russian people's perception of Paraguay? 
  [Davietjarov] In our encyclopedias we have accurate 
information on Paraguay. From the newspapers, I had a factual 
report that the political system had changed and that the 
country was on its way to democracy. I am mentally blending 
this data with what I now see here for myself. We hope that 
democracy will continue in Paraguay. 
  [Loma] Let us now discuss your country's domestic 
situation. The IMF has admitted that your program of reforms is 
too risky and did not take into account, or took very little 
into account, the social cost, which is very high. Do you agree? 
  [Davietjarov] I can only give your my personal opinion. Our 
people, rich or poor, will not back down. Everyone in our 
country dreams of liberty. We say in Russia that bread alone is 
not enough to live on. Our people are beginning to enjoy 
liberty and do not want to lose it. Not just liberty, but also 
the privatization program, which is going very fast. For 
example, the privatization of the oil industry. Some 25 percent 
of our enterprise has been offered to the workers, completely 
free of charge. Another 15 percent has been offered to them, 
allowing them to purchase shares over three years without paying 
any interest. These special measures have been exclusively 
implemented in the Russian oil industry. Because our enterprise 
is taking the initial steps toward privatization, the majority 
of stock must remain in the hands of the government. The 
complete process will take about three years. I believe this is 
the appropriate way to do things. This is the general 
situation. Most people support the government in the 
implementation of the program of reforms. 
  [Loma] President Yeltsin has just replaced the economy 
minister, who was very radical, by someone who is more 
conservative, seeking to reduce the pace of reforms. Do you 
believe this is a timely change? 
  [Davietjarov] I personally know the new economy minister and 
can say that he is in favor of a market economy. Unlike you, I 
do not believe this change of ministers necessarily means a 
slower pace toward a market economy. There is another, more 
simple explanation for this change of ministers. When you are 
heading for an unknown location, you must first go slowly, but 
on other occasions you must go at full speed. I can tell you 
that our government program will not radically change. We have 
a new parliament in which there are many economists. I am sure 
that their decisions will be correct. Our people understand 
perfectly that problems always occur during changes of this 
magnitude. 
  [Loma] What is your personal opinion of Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy 
and on the great success he achieved in the past elections. 
  [Davietjarov] I am personally sure, very sure, that Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy will never be our country's president. 
  [Loma] Why not? 
  [Davietjarov] Because he totally lost the success he 
achieved 
in the elections following his remarks and visits to various 
foreign countries. The Russian people now know him well. I 
believe Vladimir Zhirinovskiy should stop considering himself 
the future president of Russia. 
  [Loma] What is your personal opinion on Russia's current 
situation? Do you believe the West has abandoned you in a sense? 
  [Davietjarov] My personal opinion is that Russia, alone, 
must 
be able to succeed. We have great scientists and intellectuals. 
The country can succeed alone and overcome this difficult 
situation. If the West moves away, it will return sooner or 
later. It is not a problem. (he laughs) 
  [Loma] Would you like to add anything for the Paraguayan 
people? What would you like to tell the Paraguayan people from 
the Russian people? 
  [Davietjarov] No one in my country has given me the right to 
speak in his or her name. Nevertheless, as an ordinary Russian 
citizen, I hope you will continue on this democratic path and 
have good relations with all countries, including Russia. Our 
people work hard and, according to what I have seen so far, 
Paraguayans also work hard. We have something in common. I 
hope Paraguay will be modernized as we are being modernized.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Mar (EFE) -- The foreign and 
economy ministers of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay -- 
the member countries of the Common Market of the South 
(Mercosur) -- today conveyed their support for the "full 
deregulation of trade" among all South American countries. 
  The Argentine foreign and economy ministers, Guido Di Tella 
and Domingo Cavallo; the Brazilian foreign and finance 
ministers, Celso Amorim and Fernando Henrique Cardoso; the 
Paraguayan foreign and finance ministers, Luis Maria Ramirez 
Boettner and Crispiniano Sandoval; and the Uruguayan foreign and 
economy ministers, Sergio Abreu and Ignacio de Posadas, today 
met in Buenos Aires to discuss this goal. 
  In a joint communique, the Mercosur ministers agreed "to 
discuss every available option to promote a comprehensive 
regional economic integration on the basis of the Brazilian 
proposal" to create the South American Free Trade Association 
(ALCSA). 
  To this end, the ministers decided to meet again in Buenos 
Aires on 25 March "to make headway toward making ALCSA 
compatible." At that special meeting, "the continental 
projection of Mercosur will be evaluated." 
  They agreed on stating that "bilateral or multilateral 
agreements with other South American countries" with a view to 
furthering free trade in the region "will be concluded despite 
other integration agreements those countries may have entered 
with other countries in Latin America or elsewhere in the 
hemisphere." 
  They also agreed to "maintain close coordination regarding 
ALCSA and other proposals" as a way of "promoting the 
participation of Mercosur member countries in agreements 
relating to them so that a common policy can be implemented." 
  The Mercosur ministers also expressed their "support for the 
full deregulation of trade among all South American countries as 
an ultimate objective and as a way to promote the incorporation 
of the region into the world's and hemisphere's economy." 
  The ministers reaffirmed their support for "compliance" with 
the Mercosur implementation timetable "as far as the 
establishment of a common external tariff is concerned."

Soares stated that the nineties are not the sixties. 
  Upon his arrival in Chile, where he will participate in the

  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- Last night National Congress 
President Carlos Flores swore in Angel Edmundo Orellana Mercado 
as the new prosecutor general of the Republic and head of the 
recently created Office of the Prosecutor General. 
  After debating a list of eight candidates presented by an ad 
hoc high-level commission for several weeks, Orellana Mercado 
and Florentino Alvarez Alvarado [the new deputy prosecutor 
general] were elected by the congressional plenary last Thursday. 
  Orellana Mercado addressed the deputies briefly after he was 
sworn in and promised to do his work with loyalty to the 
country, people, and God. He said he would make efforts to 
strengthen the pillars of democracy and guarantee that all 
Hondurans are finally able to enjoy a state of law and happiness 
together with their families. "I will contribute so that, 
together with you, we can build the country's future," Orellana 
Mercado told the deputies. 
  Alvarez Alvarado was not sworn in as deputy prosecutor 
general last night because, due to personal reasons, he was 
unable to attend the Congress session. He will, thus, be sworn 
in the coming days.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Otero] </F>
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara said he did not accept 
the resignation that Roberto Aleman, presidential adviser and 
minister without portfolio, presented yesterday. Endara added 
that Aleman's appointment is backed by the Constitution. 
  Cesar Quintero, constitutional expert and former Supreme 
Court justice, said the position of a minister without portfolio 
does not exist in presidential system governments like that of 
Panama but that it does exist in parliamentary governments. 
Quintero said the only precedent was in 1944 when the government 
of President Adolfo de la Guardia appointed Demetrio Porras as 
minister without portfolio, but for a relatively short time. 
  This week, the board of directors of the Legislative 
Assembly 
said it will file a suit of unconstitutionality at the Supreme 
Court against President Endara for violating the Constitution 
and taking over functions he does not have by appointing a 
minister without portfolio. 
  According to the president, Minister Aleman placed his 
position at the president's disposal on 8 March "to avoid 
problems and eliminate speculations." Endara did not accept the 
resignation and asked Aleman to remain in the post until the 
current presidential term ends. 
  On 7 March the Legislative Assembly harshly questioned 
Presidency Minister Ivonne Young about this appointment. Since 9 
February Aleman's name has appeared in the GACETA OFICIAL as 
minister without portfolio. 
  "I think the legislators and the Assembly board of directors 
have been extremely unfair with Minister Young, because she was 
not the one who appointed Aleman. I appointed him," Endara said. 
He said the Constitution empowers him to appoint the ministers 
he considers necessary for the efficient functioning of his 
administration. "The legislators are mistaken. I do not have to 
consult with that government branch to appoint a minister, 
because the Constitution gives me the power to make these 
appointments," Endara said. 
  Legislative Assembly President Arturo Vallarino believes the 
minister without portfolio should not sign cabinet decrees and 
resolutions. "I am of the opinion that the president has the 
right to appoint all his advisers, but I do not think it is 
advisable for Aleman to be signing cabinet resolutions," he 
added.

  [Excerpt] (DYN-NA) -- The Catholic Church yesterday came 
out in favour of having future presidents swear by "God and 
country" when taking the oath of office without regard to his or 
her religion thus accepting heads of state of other religions 
while rejecting the possibility of having an atheist leader. 
  The Church also warned that the current presidential system 
"sometimes leads" to an uncontrollable growth of the powers of 
the head of state in a nine-page document issued by the Synod of 
Bishops on the government's plan to reform the nation's 
Constitution. 
  The religious leaders said that "other branches of 
government 
should be strengthened to obtain a balance and a real division 
of powers in the state." 
  "It is not our intention to propose a reform draft; our 
objective was to point out issues that cannot be absent in the 
new Constitution," they explained. 
  The Church confirmed that it had doubts about the way in 
which President Carlos Menem and Radical Party Chairman Raul 
Alfonsin had agreed on a reform plan through the Olivos Pact. 
  The bishops group also accepted the dropping of the 
Constitution's current requirement that the president be a Roman 
Catholic. 
  However, it underlined that "the cultural identity of the 
Argentine nation has unquestionable Roman Catholic roots." 
  The document specifies that the definition of God included 
in 
the Constitution as the "source of all reason and justice" 
should be maintained in the new charter. 
  In addition, the Church said that the new law of the land 
should include an article similar to the one included in the 
Cordoba Constitution stating that "the dignity and moral and 
physical integrity of human life from its conception cannot be 
violated." [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Uruguay monitored through 10 
March. 
  Despite the trade surplus in the last month of 1993, the 
1993 
trade balance deficit reached a record $679.1 million. This was 
the result of exports that totalled $1.6453 billion, a drop of 
3.4 percent, and imports of $2.3244 billion, an increase of 13.7 
percent. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 21 Feb 
94 Economic Page p 10) 
  The Central Bank reported that the value of fishing exports 
was $69.6 million in December 1993, a drop of 25.8 percent 
compared with the $93.8 million in the same month in 1992. 
(Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 22 Feb 94 
Maritime News Section p 1) 
  The export of nontraditional products increased 20.5 percent 
between 1989 and 1993. The items that registered a significant 
increase are: dairy products, 42.5 percent; lumber and 
furnitures, 166 percent; rubber products, 16 percent; machines 
and electrical appliances, 53.4 percent; and transportation 
material, 136 percent. The export of traditional products 
dropped 27 percent in the past four years. (Montevideo EL 
OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 24 Feb 94 p 8) 
  The National Ports Administration will invest a $2 million 
loan from the World Bank to finance projects in the port of 
Montevideo. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 22

<F P=106> [Speech by President Rafael Caldera at ceremony to sign </F>
emergency banking law in Caracas -- live] 
  [Text] Mr. President of Congress; Mr. President of the 
Chamber of Deputies; Messrs. Senators, Deputies, Ministers, and 
representatives of public power; and civilian society: 
  I will just say a few words to state that we have decided to 
promulgate without delay the emergency law that Congress has 
issued so that the special measures contained in the law can be 
adopted immediately and the situation of Banco Latino and the 
financial system in general can be addressed. 
  I think that in this case, we have had the first experience 
of what we call the commitment to solidarity. All the public 
power institutions have contributed to the effort to face this 
delicate, difficult, and complex situation. The private sector 
has also expressed, in different ways, its willingness to 
cooperate so that solutions can be undertaken to the 
satisfaction of a large number of Venezuelans and foreign 
residents in the country who have seen their economic situation 
gravely jeopardized by the events that have taken place. 
  After promulgating the emergency law, the national 
government 
plans to immediately present to the legislative chambers a bill 
with a brief partial reform of the published document because it 
considers that some of the approved provisions, due to the 
justified brevity of time because of the praiseworthy urgency 
with which Congress worked on the law...[pauses] perhaps there 
was not sufficient thought about the consequences that some of 
the norms might have and which, far from helping, might hinder 
the objective of achieving the reorganization of the Venezuelan 
financial system, which is an objective that concerns all of us. 
The law that I just signed has this double objective: on the 
one hand to address the emergency situation, the special 
situation created by the Banco Latino crisis, and on the other 
to give the branches of government the definite possibility of 
favorably resolving the aspects that might create fear among the 
Venezuelan community and the difficulties for the operation of 
the financial system. 
  I am sure that the same climate of dialogue and cooperation 
among the branches of government, which has prevailed in the 
passage of this law, will also be present when the government 
proposals regarding this are received. 
  I think today's action brings hope to those who have watched 
their personal situation with anguish due to the Banco Latino 
crisis, which I have not hesitated to describe as a real 
disaster and whose dimension has exceeded everything that was 
initially thought when the government of President Ramon 
Velasquez decreed the intervention of that bank. 
  I thank those present here, especially the members of the 
legislative chambers and the members of the committees that have 
been involved in this issue. I thank them on behalf of 
Venezuelans because they have maintained an open-minded, 
understanding, and constructive position that undoubtedly leads 
us to have strong hope about the future of the country and which 
views with undeniable and appropriate concern the situation of 
the economy and the National Treasury. 
  Again, thank you, and I hope the Venezuelan people, who have 
been shaken by the recent events of Banco Latino will feel more 
secure and have more hope about the efforts that the public and 
private sectors are making to guarantee everyone their 
legitimate rights and to share the necessary sacrifice to 
resolve the situation. [applause]

  [Text] Guatemala City, 7 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Today the 
Central American Parliament (Parlacen), asked the European Union 
(EU) to extend for an additional 10 years the special and 
temporary preferential tariffs for most products imported from 
the region. 
  The initiative was approved today by the Parlacen plenum 
presided over by Salvadoran Francisco Guerrero. Parlacen has 
representatives from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. 
  The regional political forum reported in a communique that 
the EU granted preferential access to its market to a broad 
range of Central American products, excluding bananas, but that 
the term will expire on 31 December. 
  Due to the "worrisome" situation in exports, it has been 
deemed convenient to ask the EU to renew this preferential 
treatment for 10 more years, the communique states. 
  The initiative will be passed on to regional presidents, who 
in turn will instruct their foreign and economy ministers to 
present this at the meeting of the San Jose 10, between Central 
America and Europe, slated for 28-29 March in Athens, Greece. 
  Parlacen also asked the European Parliament's support in 
obtaining more preferential tariffs.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 8 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- The European 
Union (EU) will grant "top priority" to economic cooperation to 
Central America to support this region's integration, according 
to a document released here. The document is to be approved 
this month in Greece. The declaration, entitled "Economic 
Content of the San Jose X Joint Communique," was drafted on 7 
and 10 March by the Isthmus deputy foreign ministers and EU 
representatives. It will be approved on 28 and 29 March during 
the ministerial summit to be held in Athens, Greece. 
  According to the document, the European ministers will 
express satisfaction over the advances in Central American 
economic integration. The EU officials will recognize the 
progress made in the Isthmus by implementing actions to 
incorporate the area into the world economy. 
  The text cited the elimination of obstacles to commerce and 
the renegotiation of the Central American uniform customs 
tariff, as well as the agreements on the implementation of 
safeguards. The 12-page declaration mentioned the European 
position on the expansion of economic and social development in 
the Isthmus. 
  During the Athens meeting, the European and Central American 
foreign ministers will express their concern over the impact the 
economic adjustment programs have on the neediest sectors. The 
EU representatives reiterated their offer of support to handle 
the needs of the sectors hurt the most by those policies. 
  Concerning tax uniformity, the Central American side will 
ask 
its European counterpart to provide its knowledge and experience 
on the matter. The European ministers will stress multilateral 
commercial negotiations within the framework of the Uruguay 
Round, with the idea the implementation of these accords will 
have positive effects in relaunching the international economy 
on clear rules. 
  At the Athens meeting, the two regions will establish a 
commercial forum with yearly ordinary meetings to strengthen an 
exchange on the matter. Regarding access to the European 
market, the Central American ministers will explain their 
concern over the difficulties regional exports face in Europe. 
The document that must be approved by the foreign ministers of 
the two regions cited the advisability of overcoming obstacles 
that limit the growth of commercial flows. The officials will 
mention the importance of the preferences on customs tariffs the 
EU has granted to Central American exports. 
  They will also reiterate the agreement established in 
principle to review commercial aspects on a yearly basis. 
Officials from the two regions will discuss the marshaling of 
financial resources via the European Investment Bank and 
reaffirm the need to promote economic aid. 
  The ministers will assess the EU's aid to Central America in 
the past decade and will stress its importance for the peace, 
democracy, and development processes. The officials will also 
discuss topics concerning the environment, Central American 
refugees, coffee and bananas, social investment, and the area's 
peace process.

  [Text] Defense Minister Oscar Camilion yesterday confirmed 
that there is a UN weapons embargo on Liberia. This has 
frustrated the sale of Argentine weapons worth $34 million. 
  Camilion denied to Radio Mitre that the operation was vetoed 
by the Foreign Ministry. He admitted that the sale "was 
canceled when the Foreign Ministry informed us of a UN weapons 
embargo on Liberia." All weapons sales abroad must be approved 
by a committee made up of high-ranking officials from the 
Defense, Foreign, and Economy Ministries. 
  The shipment to Liberia included 15 155-mm cannons, light 
weapons -- such as FAL [Light Automatic Rifle] rifles -- 
ammunition, and explosives. 
  The operation had made so much progress that the Military 
Industries had already dispatched the first consignment of 
weapons from the factory in Rio Tercero, Cordoba, on 80 trucks 
to the military factory in Pilar before its shipment. 
  The Defense minister said "two orders had been received: one 
was ruled out because it was for Croatia, on which there is a 
weapons embargo; and the other was for Liberia. We were 
informed at the last minute that there is a UN weapons embargo 
on Liberia." 
  The first time the deal came to light was when a group of 
Radical Civic Union deputies, headed by Antonio Berhongaray, 
asked last week if weapons would be sold to Croatia. 
  The great suspicion stemming from the frustrated operation 
to 
Liberia is that this poor country does not have $34 million in 
cash, unless it is acting as a "front" for the purchase. The 
shipment may be a triangular operation by Liberia, under which 
the arms would end up in Croatia, which is at war with Serbia 
within the former Yugoslavia. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella said that "at no 
moment" would a triangular operation to send weapons to a 
country in conflict, like Croatia, have been allowed. 
  It is not just that weapon sales to Croatia are prohibited 
by 
the United Nations, the operation would have caused problems for 
the Argentine Army battalion that is among the UN peace forces 
in the Balkans. In face of an operation of this kind, the Serbs 
could have retaliated against the Argentine Blue Helmets. 
  Camilion's remarks do not answer all doubts that stem from 
this controversial operation. The first is, if the Argentine 
Foreign Ministry reported the existence of an embargo, how come 
part of the order was shipped on 80 trucks and a draft decree 
authorizing the sale signed? 
  Official sources told CLARIN that during an initial 
consultation, a mid-ranking Foreign Ministry official informed 
the Military Industries that there was no objection to the 
operation. That is why so much progress was made. 
  However, given the importance of the subject, Camilion spoke 
on 3 March with a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official who 
confirmed that in principle there was no problem with the 
operation. The following day, however, the diplomat reported 
that there was a weapons embargo on Liberia which forced the 
Military Industries to suspend the operation which would have 
saved it for this year from the financial crisis in which it 
finds itself.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Mar (NA) -- Foreign Minister Guido 
Di Tella said today that the British "need to pay more heed" to 
the Malvinas Islands in light of the diplomatic "pressure" being 
imposed by the Argentine Government. 
  Di Tella said that both the British and the islanders "have 
realized that the level of activity of the Argentine Government 
has increased drastically compared with past levels." 
  In making an evaluation of the "Operation Charming" by which 
the Argentine and British Governments are trying to effect a 
rapprochement, Di Tella admitted that "sometimes we do well, and 
sometimes we do not." 
  He showed confidence, however, in the progress of the talks, 
and believes that it would be useful "to have more contacts." 
  Regarding the real lifting of the arms embargo, Di Tella 
said 
the exact date is not yet known, but added that this issue has 
in any case "gone into the shadows, as something past and 
overcome." 
  Despite this, he said, a monthly evaluation of the issue 
will 
be made in the future. 
  In comments made on the radio, Di Tella admitted there is a 
possibility of buying Rolls Royce engines for Argentine Navy 
ships. He said: "After the first weapons are sold the embargo 
issue will no longer hold any water." 
  Di Tella also said that the unofficial talks to bring 
British 
secret agents to train their Argentine counterparts "have 
nothing to do" with the rapprochement being carried out by the 
Argentine and British foreign ministers. 
  "That was a discussion held by Hugo Anzorreguy," said Di 
Tella, who then explained that the issues discussed by the head 
of the SIDE [Secretariat for State Intelligence] were not those 
published by the newspapers. 
  Di Tella denied there was any contradiction in the idea of 
bringing British secret agents to Argentina, because "relations 
between intelligence services are considered normal, something 
that has to occur, and not anything abnormal." 
  He concluded by saying: "The same thing has to occur at all 
levels, with all friendly countries, and we are friends with 
Great Britain. Despite the differences we have over a given 
issue, there must be understanding, comprehension, and 
cooperation."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Mar (EFE) -- The Argentine and 
Brazilian foreign ministers, Celso Amorim and Guido Di Tella 
respectively, signed an agreement on 10 March on the need for 
regular meetings between the two countries aimed at 
strengthening their bilateral relations and stimulating the 
exchange of ideas and opinions. 
  Di Tella said that the agreement was signed after the two 
countries realized that Argentine-Brazilian bilateral relations 
were becoming too centered around Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South], that is, on talks centered around Mercosur concerns, 
while important bilateral aspects were being left aside. 
  The agreement was discussed last night, following a closed 
door meeting between representatives of the two countries to 
analyze Brazil's purchase of subsidized Canadian wheat. 
  Di Tella and Amorim also discussed the Argentine desire to 
have an option to join NAFTA, which is made up of the United 
States, Canada, and Mexico, without abandoning Mercosur. 
  The agreement establishes that the two countries' presidents 
will meet once a year, while representatives of all ministries 
and the foreign relations vice ministers will meet every three 
or four months. 
  Such meetings will create "ad hoc" working groups to discuss 
and follow specific matters. 
  Di Tella and Amorim announced the details of the agreement 
today, shortly before their meeting with the other Mercosur 
member countries' foreign and economy ministers. Mercosur is 
made up of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay.

  [Text] Santiago del Estero, 12 Mar (NA) -- Jose Zavalia, 
the Radical Civic Union [UCR] party boss in Santiago del Estero, 
last night headed a demonstration march that gathered little 
support from La Banda to this city, to protest the federal 
intervention headed by Juan Schiaretti and the Omnibus Law for 
the rational use of provincial resources. 
  In contrast with other demonstrations sponsored by Zavalia, 
on this occasion only about 1,500 people joined the radical 
leader in his demand. 
  At approximately 2115 a caravan of about 1,000 people left 
La 
Banda toward the capital, reaching the highway at the entrance 
to the capital at 2300, where 600 demonstrators were waiting, 
and where Zavalia was the main speaker at the anti-government 
demonstration. 
  Zavalia, who as usual participated in the rally mounted upon 
his chestnut steed, said that with Schiaratti's trusteeship 
"corruption continues" in Santiago del Estero. 
  It was explained that the demonstration was small because 
the 
unions plan to boycott the elections to be held on 10 April. 
  In another matter, Santiago del Estero provincial employees 
have already solved part of their problem over back pay, which 
was the reason for the outbreak of violence in this province 
last December. 
  On that occasion demonstrators had surrounded Zavalia in his 
house, and it even led to shots fired between Zavalia and the 
demonstrators. 
  As to why so few people participated, those responsible for 
the demonstration said that the reason was the "pressure" being 
exerted on the public by the trusteeship. 
  Zavalia headed the demonstration riding his horse, followed 
by about 100 buses contracted for the occasion, which were for 
the most part filled only by UCR militants and sympathizers. 
  In any case, this first demonstration of power by the 
Santiago del Estero radical forces in light of the upcoming 
elections for Constituent Assembly members was not a very 
convincing one for the UCR provincial leaders.

<F P=106> [Report on interviews with small and medium businessmen by </F>
Virginia Perez Araoz, Gladys Delvalle, and Marcela Lachman; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Four Questions For Small and Medium Business (SMB) </H5>
  LA PRENSA has spoken with a group of small and medium 
businessmen from various sectors. We posed four questions to our 
interviewees, most of whom agreed in our succinct dialogues that 
their companies are "defenseless," although almost none of them 
would exchange stability and the convertible peso for anything. 
  As for the interest rates that they would consider optimum, 
there was little agreement, except that the current rates are 
unaffordable. While the most radical would like to see 
international rates no higher than one percent, others would 
tolerate 7 percent. 
  The questions were: 
  1) What do you think 1994 will be like for your sector and, 
in particular, for your business? 
  2) What are the main competitive disadvantages that you face 
as a sector and as a business? 
  3) Do you think that there will be affordable private credit 
for small and medium business and what rate would be 
"affordable" in your judgment? 
  4) If you had three wishes in economic policy, what would 
they be? 
<H5>  Peso Must Be Devalued </H5>
  Jorge Mazza, Manager of Vilmax, a dye manufacturing firm 
that 
exports two-thirds of its output: 
  1) Our company is regarded as one of the 100 innovators, but 
I think that it still has a long way to go. 
  The problem lies in the lack of responsibility and 
efficiency 
of the Argentine people. I feel that they do not do responsible 
work and that they would rather be charming and "hustle" 
everybody else. 
  2) What makes things hard for SMB is the exchange rate. 
Argentine costs are very high, and the result is an expensive, 
poorly made, inefficient product. 
  3) Loans would start to be granted if the government felt 
obliged to see this happen. Many SMB's are going to disappear 
unless they are helped. The tariff ought to be 5 or 6 percent. 
  4) Argentine costs that would enable us to compete 
internationally. A devaluation is needed. Italy is an example 
that ought to be kept in mind. They devalued the lira, and as a 
result costs did not rise. Our currency could be devalued if we 
did things in earnest. 
  Halt the indiscriminate economic liberalization, and control 
and determine the usefulness of things entering the country. 
  Let us educate ourselves so that we do better work. 
<H5>  Fine, But Without Anyone's Help </H5>
  Omar Bacchi, owner of the Nogali cookie company: 
  1) I do not think that 1994 will be much different from 
1993. 
Support for small and mid-sized industry will remain grudging. 
We can see the proof in what is happening with the federal 
fiscal pact. Everything is happening there as if industry, 
particularly SMB, did not exist. 
  In spite of the risk, my company is investing in technology 
(to the extent of my potential and by going into debt). 
  2) One of my main competitive disadvantages on the domestic 
market is having to convert my products and sales structure 
quickly to reach other segments of the market amid a recession 
and stiff competition. 
  On foreign markets, although we have the potential advantage 
of being an agribusiness, we have all of the disadvantages of 
the manufacturing sector in general and the lack of dependable 
government support (which is only talked about). 
  3) I do not think that there is going to be affordable 
credit, either private or governmental. The interest rate on 
loans should be in line with anticipated inflation. 
  4) To have a recovery on the domestic market; to see a 
genuine, dependable policy of support for SMB; and to see 
"affordable credit" and "production revolution," among other 
expressions, become more than just political slogans. 
<H5>  SMB's Help the Banks </H5>
  Carlos Rodriguez, manager of Transfrigo, a refrigerated 
transportation firm: 
  1) 1994 is going to be a difficult, highly competitive year 
because there is an ever-increasing supply of transportation 
services, not only from freight haulers but also from the 
railways, which are more efficient in private hands. 
  2) The main problem is the lack of credit for investment. 
Having a place in the market means keeping up to date, and this 
demands investment in technology. 
  Ground rules are needed. Up to now there has been no 
specific 
oversight of our industry. Only recently has the government been 
performing the policing function that properly belongs to it and 
begun considering the need for a transportation law that would 
provide a basic frame of reference. 
  SMB's are the ones that have the most competition. Their 
competitors are individual truck owners, who up to now have 
shirked every obligation. 
  3) The banks are not helping SMB's, which are instead 
helping 
the banks. Interest rates should not exceed 7 percent a month; 
they should be between 3 and 4 percent. 
  4) Maintain stability; undertake labor reform and revoke any 
provision that violates free trade (regulations, fees); the 
government should get the policy of external investments moving. 
<H5>  A Clear-Cut Economic Policy </H5>
  Mario Elkouss, managing partner of Longoni Electronics: 
  1) This year is not going to be the same all across the 
electronics industry. For example, things are going to be bad 
for telephones. The fact is that the country is seeing an 
indiscriminate economic liberalization, which complicates things 
for domestic firms, and even more so for SMB's. 
  On the other hand, I think that this is going to be a good 
year for services companies. 
  I feel that 1994 is going to be a good year for Longoni 
Electronics, as long as we work very hard. 
  2) The main disadvantage is the indiscriminate economic 
liberalization. Industrial decrees have established a zero 
tariff on many foreign goods entering the country. 
  One good example is transformers, which have been allowed to 
enter the country tariff-free, and as a result domestically made 
ones have disappeared. Our country now has only the spare parts 
market left. 
  3) I do not think that private lending is possible. The 
Central Bank has issued regulations mandating increasing 
guarantees and interest rates for lenders. The ideal interest 
rate should not exceed 1 percent a month. 
  The credit problem is serious for SMB's, which must 
modernize 
constantly by investing in top-quality machinery to compete with 
big business. 
  The ones that get loans take many months to pay them back. 
  4) An economic policy. The government has to state clearly 
what the ground rules are. 
  A recovery, inasmuch as without one there is very little 
circulation of money and you have to wait until you are paid to 
conduct transactions. 
  Good times for all sectors, not just my company. 
<H5>  Advertising and Deals That Close </H5>
  Gloria Lopez Lecube, owner of FM La Isla: 
  1) Growth in the sector will be in line with economic 
growth: 
4 or 5 percent a year. My company will likely continue growing, 
because the advertising pie, which is increasingly selective, 
will be divided up among those media that specifically represent 
the interests of each sector. 
  FM La Isla is aimed solely at the employers and executives 
with influence in essential decision-making. Also, we will have 
new products, such as the managers of pension funds that need to 
advertise to explain the advantages of the new system and 
capture potential customers. 
  2) The services sector and, in the area of communications in 
particular, my company are geared solely to the domestic market. 
The main competitive disadvantage is the growth of information 
pools in the print, radio, and airwave and cable television 
media, which restrict the development of the independent media. 
  The only way to compete is with a media approach like FM La 
Isla's, which aims at the stratum with high purchasing power and 
serves a selective listening and advertising public. 
  3) There is a national and international trend towards 
promoting SMB. An affordable rate to overcome the lending 
bottleneck would be 12 percent. Another measure that makes this 
year look better for SMB is the new law on business obligations, 
which allows entry into a market that had been reserved, until 
now, for big business. 
  4) Maintain growth, but make a qualitative leap called 
development. 
  Tax relief for investment, once and for all, in order to 
specify and speed up the capitalization of selected lines of 
business. 
  Lower the political decibel level in order to meet the 
challenge of the economy. 
<H5>  Long-Term Credit </H5>
  Ernesto Mario Dimov, owner of Dimov S.A., a garment 
manufacturer that has its own brands and also operates under 
international licenses: 
  1) We feel that 1994 will be a difficult year for our sector 
because we anticipate a marked decline in consumption and a lack 
of confidence about the credit to be given to customers in 
general. 
  As for our company in particular, we feel that it will be a 
good year nevertheless. 
  2) The unfair importation of items at dumping prices, with 
underbilling and low tariffs in many cases, is perhaps our main 
competitive disadvantage. 
  High financing costs make it impossible to achieve the much 
talked about goal of lowering Argentine costs. 
  3) I do not think that we will have affordable private 
credit 
in the immediate future, inasmuch as our sector has practically 
no access to the economic plan that the government is 
implementing to help SMB. There is no lending support. The 
really important thing would be to have the long-term credit 
needed for expanded production so that we could plan and budget 
for our activities over these same periods. 
  We think that it would be reasonable to provide loans at 
preferential rates for domestic producers, with interest rates 
two or three points over current world rates. 
  4) Imports at real prices, because although there have been 
some tariff hikes, they are still not high enough. 
  A recovery, which is essential for continued progress in the 
economic arena. 
  A long-term credit policy, which is indispensable if we want 
to remain a domestic company. 
<H5>  Laboratories: "Another Good Year" </H5>
  Juan Roberto Dominguez, owner of Dominguez Laboratories and 
vice president of the Cooperative of Argentine Patent Medicines 
Laboratories (Cooperala): 
  1) We will have a year very much like 1993. We are going to 
keep on growing, although there is going to be less and slower 
improvement for small and medium industries there than for big 
business. Large firms are going to continue absorbing smaller 
ones, which cannot survive on their own. 
  Since our business depends largely on bringing in new 
products (and the formalities for authorizing new patent 
medicines have been speeded up greatly under Cavallo), this is 
going to be a point in our favor. 
  1994 is going to be very promising for us as a business 
because we have begun exporting and already have contacts with 
Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Chile. We are selling two items 
on the overseas market: Demospresin and A-acid. 
  2) Mercosur [Common Market of the South] concerns us from a 
competitive standpoint, although it would not seem to be hurting 
us as much as it is the big laboratories. 
  We cannot compete with the prices of an economy as large as 
Brazil's or with the prices of local companies that manufacture 
pharmaceuticals in their plants in Uruguay or Brazil and then 
package them here. 
  3) I do not think that more affordable private credit for 
SMB 
is on the way. And today it is altogether unaffordable; I can 
say that from my own experience. 
  The foreign supplier company can give me financing for drugs 
because it has had me as a client for more than 50 years. 
  European equipment manufacturers, many of them Italian, are 
giving buyers of their products four or five years to pay for 
them, because their governments finance these loans as a way of 
promoting exports. 
  The ideal rate would be the international rate, which almost 
never reaches 1 percent a month. 
  4) Continued convertibility, because stability is linked to 
it. 
  The passage of the labor laws in order to lower costs and 
eliminate the chaos with gross earnings, among other advantages. 
  Clarification of the meaning of the patent medicines bill, 
giving consideration to the proposal of certain laboratories 
that, while not rejecting a patent law outright, want 
intellectual property respected but without monopoly patents. 
<H5>  A Difficult 1994 on the Way </H5>
  Guillermo Gomez Galizia, a businessman in the health 
services 
sector and a full member of the Chamber of Medical Diagnostic 
Institutions (Cadime) and of the General Economic Confederation 
of the federal capital: 
  1) We anticipate difficulties in several sectors of the 
economy and especially in the SMB sector. Many of them have been 
unable to cope easily with reconversion; in contrast, those that 
have managed to stay afloat are having a very hard time adapting. 
  The sectors involved in consumer goods and the services 
sector have recorded a significant expansion in recent times, 
leading to excess supply at present. 
  2) The main disadvantages for SMB's in general on the 
domestic market are the inordinately high interest rates for 
firms of this size. The tax burden falls most heavily on 
production and consumption, not on income as in the developed 
countries. We suffer from technological obsolescence, arising 
mainly from these disadvantages. Services are expensive, which 
boosts production costs. And in the case of companies tied to 
regional economies, freight charges are uncompetitive because 
the transport SMB's have the same overall problems. 
  3) As the profile of SMB's is redefined, there will be a 
better chance of getting loans in the private sector as well. If 
the definition of an SMB is a company with, on the average, more 
than 200 employees, annual sales of over $15 million, or 
production assets of over five million pesos, then a great many 
are going to be left out. 
  As for the interest rate, if we have inflation indices like 
those in the developed countries, it should be in line with them. 
  4) Maintain the stability that has been achieved; take 
immediate steps to grow and create jobs; establish mechanisms so 
that SMB's can take full part in the economy and thus facilitate 
its democratization. 
<H5>  Efforts at Reconversion </H5>
  Rolando Pietrantueno, chairman of the Argentine Industrial 
Council (CAI) and a businessman in the metalworking sector: 
  1) and 2) The manufacturing industry has been engaged in 
intensive reconversion since the economy was opened up through 
the convertibility plan, this being part of the policy behind 
it. The result was immediate price competition between imported 
and domestic goods. 
  Small and medium industry found itself at a clear 
disadvantage in achieving the goal as fast as was required and 
without "anesthesia." It made an enormous effort to cut its own 
internal costs but was severely restricted by external ones, 
which can be summed up as the so-called "Argentine cost," which 
includes fiscal policy, energy rates, ports, communications, the 
workmen's compensation law, and fiscal labor costs. 
  To this we can add the genuine difficulty of obtaining 
credit, which is an essential tool for bringing in the necessary 
technology to improve productivity and replenish the working 
capital that was lost as a result of hyperinflation. 
  3) Affordable credit will probably not be available until a 
solution is found to two central problems restricting it: a 
system of guarantees that is streamlined and dynamic enough to 
overcome this fundamental restriction, and project appraisal. 
  4) Maintain the stability that has been achieved; sustained, 
equitable growth that safeguards jobs and output; human beings 
should be regarded as the hub of the system and as the sole 
beneficiary of all economic activity.

  [Text] At least 6,000 National Police [PN] officers and an 
equal number of Civilian National Police [PNC] will participate 
in the national security plan for the 20 March elections, it was 
officially reported. 
  The PNC will be in charge of La Union, Morazan, San Miguel, 
Usulutan, San Vicente, and Chalatenango Departments and their 
corresponding municipalities. The PN will be in charge of San 
Salvador, La Libertad -- excluding the seat that will be under 
the PNC -- Santa Ana, Sonsonate, and Ahuachapan Departments and 
their corresponding municipalities. 
  Security will focus on the individuals responsible for 
handling and transporting electoral material, which will be done 
via private trucks. Magistrate Eduardo Colindres explained that 
the Electoral Tribunal has solicited bids so the most 
appropriate company in terms of cost and security considerations 
can be chosen to provide the service. 
  The PNC, not the Army, will provide security for the 
transportation of electoral material. Colindres said: "The 
Electoral Code indicates that the PNC will be responsible for 
security. We have therefore reached an agreement with them to 
do so." 
  Unlike previous elections, the 20 March elections will take 
place from 0700 to 1700 in both urban and rural areas. 
  On election day, police officers will maintain a discreet 
distance from the voting place, never standing near voting 
tables or areas where voters could be moving about, Colindres 
explained. 
  In addition, the Electoral Tribunal will have at its 
disposal 
several helicopters that will transport personnel and original 
tally sheets from limited access areas to San Salvador. The 
heliport will be set up in a parking lot in front of the 
Presidente Hotel, the cite of the election control center. 
  The aircraft crew will carry out only this mission. In other 
words, documents will be handled only by Tribunal personnel, 
international observers, and party delegates, if necessary. 
There is no risk. The aircraft will have enough fuel for a 
nonstop flight, so en route technical stopovers will be 
unnecessary. 
  In addition to security at the Department seats, the PNC and 
the PN will provide security for the 262 municipalities in the 
national territory and on the routes where electoral material 
could be transported or where personnel could pass with 
electoral material. 
  The PNC and PN rank and will be linked through 
communications 
radios so their chief can learn of any incidents anywhere in the 
country. The two institutions will be supplied with vehicles 
and radios with a range wide enough to cover the entire country. 
  Although it has not been officially decided, it is possible 
that a specific number of soldiers could be deployed on some 
roads as a deterrent in case of an emergency. As of yesterday, 
meetings were still being held to discuss the security plan. 
  In La Libertad Department, the PNV will provide security for 
the (Nueva San Salvador or Santa Tecla) seat, while the PN will 
be responsible for the municipalities and the road to the seat. 
  There are some places labeled former conflict areas where 
FMLN groups are known to have their rank and file organized. 
One example is the Perquin road to Sabaneras, where an 
"entrance" is controlled by FMLN groups that restrict passage. 
It is said that this place has difficult access. The PNC will 
also be in these places, consulted sources said. 
  Regarding statements by some groups organized by political 
parties that they are "security for the votes," the consulted 
sources said there is no danger as each party is responsible for 
the actions of each of its members.

<F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer] On 9 March, Dr. Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, 
chief of Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador], voiced his 
concerns over anomalies in the electoral process related to the 
transfer of ballot boxes and the issuing of voter identity 
cards. Regarding these problems, Ramirez pointed out that the 
Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] decided to transfer polling 
stations from four Chalatenango Department municipalities to the 
departmental capital. He noted that this violates the Electoral 
Code. Mario Jovel filed this report: 
  [Jovel] Dr. Ramirez was displeased with the TSE plan to 
transfer polling stations from several Chalatenango 
municipalities to the departmental capital. The Onusal chief 
said that transfer is unjustified and violates the Electoral 
Code. 
  [Begin Ramirez recording] It is indispensable that we 
consult 
with the municipal electoral boards and the supervision 
[vigilancia] board. The latter, in an announcement on 8 March 
-- according to information available to me -- did not recommend 
this transfer. [end recording] 
  [Jovel] Ramirez added that despite efforts by the TSE, 
Onusal, and political parties to overcome problems with requests 
to enter names on the voter rolls without the prior submission 
of identity documents, there are still 75,000 people unable to 
obtain their cards. The diplomat said that 45 [word indistinct] 
points were established where requests may be rejected. Most of 
these, he added, are located in former conflict zones. But this 
is not enough to claim that there is any sort of fraud: 
  [Begin Ramirez recording] The 75,000 [word indistinct] not 
supported by identity documents are distributed proportionally 
throughout the country. They are distributed on the basis of 
electoral volume [volumenes electorales]. In other words, it is 
difficult to determine just who is affected by this situation. 
[end recording] 
  [Jovel] The Onusal chief noted that not all the news is bad. 
For example, the 2.3 million citizens supplied with voter 
identity cards -- a figure predicted by his organization -- was 
increased by 100,000. Ramirez added that this represents 90 
percent of the potential vote, the highest ever for the country 
in its electoral history. 
  [Announcer] In this regard, Dr. Jaime Romero Ventura, TSE 
magistrate for Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance], said 
that Article 117 of the Electoral Code has definitely not been 
violated, because the decision to transfer ballot boxes to 
Chalatenango was made in consultation with the departmental 
boards. Erwin Gongora filed this report. 
  [Gongora] Dr. Romero stated emphatically that the decision 
to 
transfer ballot boxes from certain Chalatenango Department 
municipalities for the elections arose from an agreement with 
the departmental boards and was not an arbitrary decision. This 
change in polling stations, the Arena magistrate added, is being 
made for specific reasons. 
  [Begin Romero recording] First, 90 percent of the residents 
of those four municipalities live in the departmental capital. 
Second, two of these municipalities don't have electricity or 
telephone service. This would hinder the forwarding of results. 
[end recording] 
  [Gongora] Romero pointed out this is not an isolated case, 
as 
similar instances have been reported, including those in Colon 
in La Libertad and San Francisco Menendez in Ahuachapan, where 
the same request was made for similar reasons. He also 
explained why approximately 79,000 people will not be able to 
obtain their voter identity cards in time to vote on 20 March. 
  [Begin Romero recording] Specifically, the 79,000 people 
were 
not validated because their birth certificates are not 
registered in the corresponding municipalities. Thus, we do not 
have those files. I want you to know that these 79,000 citizens 
who unfortunately will be unable to vote are dispersed 
throughout the country. Actually they live in municipalities 
destroyed by the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front] during the war. [end recording] 
  [Gongora] Romero also announced that the TSE has redoubled 
security upon the discovery by state intelligence organs of a 
plot by unidentified people to seize the TSE computer center. 
He added that the goal of this action is the destabilization of 
the electoral process.

  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani yesterday said the peace 
accords are progressing normally -- in fact, some of them have 
been stepped up -- and only the total deployment of the National 
Civic Police (PNC), which is going along according to schedule, 
will be left pending by the time he concludes his term. 
  The president announced the government is about to present a 
plan to further expedite the land transfer program so it ends in 
May, when the new agricultural cycle begins. Cristiani 
explained the plan allows the possibility of issuing land 
appropriation titles with a specific value for each beneficiary 
-- whether he is a member of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front] or the Armed Forces -- and they can personally 
expedite the negotiation with land owners who want to sell their 
assets. 
  The document can expedite the negotiation with land owners 
and the only remaining thing would be to sign a deed and grant 
financial aid through the Land Bank. The goal is to define the 
ownership of all the land, the president said. "Approximately 
10,000 FMLN members have received these benefits and 10,000 are 
still pending; while barely 2,000 Armed Forces members are still 
pending," he said. 
  Regarding the compensation demands from demobilized Armed 
Forces members, Cristiani said the government is complying with 
the peace accords' stipulations, and the protests are the result 
of a political movement. 
  The problem is that, in certain cases, persons show up and 
demand compensation even though they are not registered to 
obtain the benefits within a given period; and former fighters 
are demanding their inclusion, and this is not foreseen in the 
peace accords. "No country granted the necessary aid to pay the 
compensation, which surpass the 200-million-colones mark, so the 
funds come from the nation's general budget," he asserted. 
  Moreover, Defense Minister General Humberto Corado explained 
the Armed Forces are not trying to influence the 20 March 
electoral results; adding the corps' participation is 
constitutional and its work will be to place 14 helicopters at 
the disposal of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] for the 
transfer of tally sheets from the most distant corners of the 
country. "The TSE said the tally sheets' transfer will be 
supervised by Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador], the 
electoral boards, and the political parties," he emphasized.

  [Text] Army spokeswoman Edith Vargas de Marroquin stated 
that in spite of what has been said by Monica Pinto, a UN human 
rights expert, the armed institution believes that the voluntary 
Civilian Self-Defense Patrols [PAC] are positive for Guatemala. 
  Military reaction has come in the wake of a report prepared 
by Dr. Pinto that describes PAC's as the main violators of human 
rights in Guatemala and because the final resolution of the UN 
Human Rights Commission requested that PAC units in areas where 
there is no conflict be dissolved based on agreements that may 
be reached during the peace negotiations. 
  In noting that the Army's position is similar to that 
expressed by the Defense Ministry, Major Vargas affirmed that 
"the Army respects the position stated by the UN representative 
but we have our own opinion." She suggested that next time the 
UN expert visits Guatemala, "she should stay longer because this 
would permit her to speak with all the sectors, including PAC 
members." The major said that a longer visit would allow Dr. 
Pinto to have a broader idea and learn about special cases that 
cannot be understood in only eight days.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 12 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Troops loyal to 
Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio have thwarted two 
coup attempts against his government over the past three months, 
the Guatemalan newspaper EL GRAFICO reports today. 
  The newspaper, which cites Army "officers" as its sources, 
reports de Leon has been the object of two thwarted coups since 
he assumed the Presidency in June 1993, replacing deposed 
President Jorge Serrano, following his self-perpetrated coup on 
25 May of the same year. 
  Troops loyal to the president thwarted the attempted coups, 
the paper reported without expanding on the details of those who 
participated in the alleged coups to disrupt constitutional 
order. 
  The report adds after the thwarted coups the Army "has been 
strengthened, and democracy is safe." 
  Both de Leon and his defense minister, General Mario Rene 
Enriquez, have denied intense rumors of alleged coup attempts to 
unseat the chief of state. 
  They have admitted, however, "retired military and 
frustrated 
politicians," who were not identified, once knocked on the doors 
of the garrisons to promote a coup d'etat against Ramiro de 
Leon, former human rights ombudsman. 
  Enrique states the Armed Forces will no longer lend itself 
to 
any more revolts as in the past and that institutionality and 
the democratic process are guaranteed.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 11 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, the 
Guatemalan Foreign Ministry asserted in a letter to UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that the country has signed no 
agreement establishing borders with Belize, and it adds that 
Guatemala maintains a territorial claim on the former British 
colony. 
  Foreign Minister Marithza Ruiz de Vielman asked the United 
Nations to inform its member states about the Guatemalan 
Government's territorial claim, which includes an area of land 
in Belizean territory and maritime areas on the Caribbean Ocean. 
Ruiz de Vielman said the joint declaration signed by the two 
states on 31 July 1992 does not recognize the definition of 
their territorial and maritime limits. She recalled that 
Guatemala recognized Belize as an independent state in September 
1992 without relinquishing its claim, which dates back 150 years. 
  The diplomat's letter to Ghali emphasized that the 
government 
respects the free determination of nations and believes the 
settlement of controversies between states should be reached 
through peaceful means. She added that the Guatemalan Government 
is prepared to continue direct discussions with the former 
British colony to reach a definite solution to the dispute. 
  "Guatemala formally rejects anything which violates its 
sovereignty, continental shelf, control of its territorial seas, 
or exclusive economic zone, both those defined in the past and 
those which may result when the dispute is settled," the text 
added. The document said Guatemala's territorial sea is 12 
maritime miles (more than 18 km) wide. 
  "Until the dispute is settled, Guatemala cannot accept nor 
does it accept boundaries that are equidistant to states, 
adjacent coasts, or coasts that face each other if they 
negatively affect its sovereign right to 12 maritime miles," she 
emphasized. Ruiz said the government is willing to adopt control 
measures to prevent the violation of its laws and its customs, 
immigration, and health regulations. 
  She confirmed that the country's economic zone comprises an 
area beyond its territorial sea and adjacent zones, which extend 
200 maritime miles beyond the boundaries used to measure the 
width of its territorial sea. Also, the continental shelf 
extends 200 miles with exclusive sovereignty rights to exploit 
its natural resources, she said. 
  She emphasized that Guatemala will not recognize the 
charters 
or lists of geographic coordinates prepared by Belize until they 
reach a definite agreement that is satisfactory to the two 
parties. The foreign minister asked the United Nations to inform 
its member states about Guatemala's position on Belize.

<F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Cuba has reiterated its willingness to restore 
telephone communications with the United States through 
agreements with U.S. telecommunications companies that are able 
to follow the proper procedures justly, equally, and reasonably. 
An official note from the Cuban Government states it is 
awaiting a decision from the U.S. Federal Communications 
Commission, which could authorize three of that country's 
companies to initiate telecommunication services to Cuba. 
  The information, reported by the official newspaper GRANMA, 
says these are norms established by the State Department for 
U.S. long-distance telephone companies. The note specifies 
Havana-based EntelCuba [National Telecommunication Enterprise of 
Cuba] signed recently separate agreements with three U.S. 
companies from Washington, Oklahoma, and Mississippi. GRANMA 
has reported the parties have agreed to establish a distribution 
rate of $1.20 per minute, divided by 50 percent between the 
Cuban and U.S. companies. 
  The note explains before 1991, when Hurricane Andrew 
interrupted telecommunications between the two countries, Cuba 
paid, for humanitarian reasons, all costs of the service, which 
originated in Cuban territory, without receiving a single cent 
of what was legally and justly its share. It explains that 
since 1966, as a result of the blockade, there have been 
accounts in U.S. banks totaling $100 million, resulting from 
operations various governments have carried out to prevent the 
telephone company from paying Cuba. 
  Negotiations between EntelCuba and the U.S. companies began 
during the second half of 1993, after the current U.S. 
Government authorized the resumption of traffic and the payment 
of Cuban telephone services.

  [Text] Today, in Bogota, Cuban Ambassador to Colombia Jesus 
Martinez reiterated that a meeting of Colombian rebel leaders 
never took place in Cuba. In an interview with the Radio Caracol 
network, due to the insistence of the EL TIEMPO newspaper that 
such a meeting took place, the Cuban diplomat stated that they 
are being fooled by someone interested in destroying the 
excellent relations between the two countries. Those accusations 
were also denied by the Colombian Government and the minister of 
defense, as well as by several of the participants in a 
solidarity meeting held in Havana in January. 
  The Communist Party of Colombia, as an organization that 
participated in the forum that was held in Havana, issued a 
statement saying that any attempt to distort the nature of the 
Latin American meeting was an effort to reaffirm the infamous 
U.S. blockade against Cuba. The note also stated that efforts 
are being made to block the sale of oil to Cuba, a transaction 
that was recently approved by the Colombian Government and 
condemned by recalcitrant minority groups of Cuban emigres in 
Miami.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived in Myanmar 
-- formerly Burma -- this morning from Laos, on his tour of 
seven countries of south and southeast Asia that also includes 
Cambodia, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Reporter Roberto Cavada 
obtained further details via telephone: 
  [Cavada -- live or recorded] I think it is important to 
comment, for Cubans, on the expectations and the work plan of 
the Cuban delegation in Myanmar. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The foreign minister has just 
arrived 
in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, from Laos. He is 
practically at the midpoint of his tour, which began this week 
in Indonesia and which includes Thailand. In Thailand, although 
it was a short visit, a technical stopover, Foreign Minister 
Robaina took the opportunity to talk with the Thai foreign 
minister in Bangkok. His tour also included Laos, and now 
Myanmar. 
  I would dare say that, in fact, the tour has turned out to 
be 
a big success. At all his stops, the Cuban foreign minister has 
been received by heads of government, foreign ministers, and the 
business circles of those countries. In the case of Myanmar, I 
can tell you that its foreign minister, Ohn Gyaw, visited the 
island last year; one of his objectives was to explore possible 
channels for collaboration between the two nations. The visit by 
Robaina that begins today is considered a reaffirmation of the 
relations of friendship maintained by the two nations despite 
the distance that separates us. 
  Even though it is a weekend, the foreign minister has a very 
tight schedule, with several meetings scheduled with 
high-ranking figures here. On Monday he will leave for Cambodia. 
  This is what I can tell you about this tour of the Cuban 
foreign minister through several Asian nations. Thank you, 
Cavada, and greetings to Radio Rebelde listeners. 
  [Cavada] They have, indeed, just arrived in Myanmar, and a 
great many things are to happen during the rest of the visit. We 
will be alert to the latest events in connection with the visit 
of Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to Myanmar.

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Rey Rodriguez] </F>
  [Excerpts] Ohn Gyaw, the minister of foreign affairs of 
Myanmar [formerly Burma], today expressed to Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina his country's willingness to explore 
new channels of collaboration between the two countries. At an 
official meeting during the Cuban foreign minister's two-day 
visit to Burma, Ohn Gyaw spoke with Robaina about bilateral 
relations -- which both termed good -- and about projects of 
common interest, which are to be studied. [passage omitted] 
  Robaina's visit, the first to Myanmar by a high-level Cuban 
official, is considered a reaffirmation of the relations of 
friendship maintained by the two nations despite the distance 
separating them. Today Robaina had several meetings with 
government officials and visited several developing communities, 
as well as one of that country's universities. Tomorrow he will 
be received by the president [title as heard] of Myanmar, Than 
Shwe, after which Robaina will leave for Cambodia on the third 
leg of this trip through a number of Asian nations. 
  This has been a report by Rey Rodriguez from Rangoon, 
Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.

  [Text] Various representatives from the Cuban cultural 
field, among them singer Silvio Rodriguez, will attend Chilean 
President-elect Eduardo Frei's inauguration on 11 March. This 
was confirmed by Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina. 
  Robaina said we have not received official invitations for 
the Cuban Government and authorities. He disclosed, however, 
that singer Silvio Rodriguez; the House of the Americas 
director, poet Roberto Fernandez Retamar; and Latin American 
Studies Center Director Luis Suarez have received personal 
invitations to the event. 
  In comments to ANSA, Robaina said: "We hope it (Chile) will 
continue on that path." 
  The foreign minister said Cuba respects the way the Chileans 
have handled the presidential inauguration and reiterated that 
Havana is in no hurry to resume ties with Chile. 
  Chile and Cuba broke diplomatic relations on 11 September 
1973 after the bloody military coup against constitutional 
Chilean President Salvador Allende. 
  The two countries resumed relations at a consular and 
commercial level in 1991, as a prior step to the definite 
normalization of their bilateral relations.

  [Text] Geneva, 9 Mar (EFE) -- Cuba will not give the UN 
Human Rights Commission's resolution adopted today, Wednesday, 
"more importance than what it truly deserves because it is not 
the result of true concern for the human rights situation but 
of the obstinacy of the United States. That country's insistence 
on getting us to sit on the defendant's bench leads to the same 
vicious circle every year," Jose Antonio Perez Novoa, the head 
of the Cuban delegation at this commission and the Cuban 
ambassador to the UN European office, stated. 
  The Cuban diplomat considers that the apparent concern of 
the 
United States and the countries which, almost always due to 
pressure, echo such "an immoral manipulation of human rights 
with political objectives, do not worry us in the least. Those 
concerns are not legitimate because they come from a country 
that is incapable of satisfying the most basic rights of its 
people and attempts to make another country yield through 
hunger," Perez Novoa asserted. He also questioned "the United 
States' concern for democracy" because "that country has 
financed, supported, and helped the most repressive regimes and 
the most brutal dictatorships." 
  According to the Cuban ambassador, the resolution "does not 
worry us because Cuba's only concern is the complete and 
absolute development of the Cuban people, as it will allow us to 
guarantee the rights we won a long time ago and above all to 
maintain the independence and sovereignty we achieved in 1959." 
  In Perez Novoa's opinion, "it would be absurd to purport 
that 
the United States end this farce because it has ended the 
criminal blockade it imposed on Cuba, alleging that this small 
Caribbean island represented a Communist threat." 
  Cuba -- added the diplomat -- will never refuse dialogue and 
cooperation on a truly impartial and objective basis with due 
respect to sovereign equality. It will not accept impositions 
that only seek to satisfy the whims of the hegemonic power of 
the latter part of the 20th century. "We are a free, sovereign 
country with the right to choose our own road and find our own 
solutions to the problems we confront. This right, this 
sovereignty, and this independence will never be negotiable," 
for a country that "after being a colony of slaves is today an 
honorable and independent country that will never surrender," 
Cuban Ambassador Perez Novoa asserted.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Vilma Nunez, president of the </F>
Commission for the Defense of Human Rights in Central America, 
by Beatric Padron; place and date not given; from the "Evening 
Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The Commission for the Defense of Human Rights in 
Central America [Codehuca] has denounced in Geneva the ongoing 
U.S. blockade against Cuba as a vile aggression on an entire 
nation. 
  Vilma Nunez, president of Codehuca and of the Nicaraguan 
Human Rights Center, has traveled to Geneva to participate in UN 
Human Rights Commission sessions to expound on the current 
situation of those rights in the Central American region. 
  Nunez discussed this and other related issues with Radio 
Havana Cuba. 
  [Begin Nunez recording] With regard to the human rights 
situation, there exists what we might call a news embargo at the 
international level. The international media are telling the 
world that there is peace in Central America and that human 
rights are not being violated, but this is not true. Human 
rights violations remain part of the official policy of many 
governments. There are other cases. For example, in Nicaragua, 
Panama, and Costa Rica, neoliberal policies are pushing our 
people into poverty. This is taking place as part of a pattern 
of economic repression. The implementation of this policy, 
whether speaking in practical terms or in terms of human rights, 
comprises a systematic violation of economic and social rights. 
Neoliberal policies are pushing most of our people into 
poverty. [end recording] 
  One of Codehuca's strategic objectives is to mobilize its 
nongovernment member-organizations in defense of the Cuban 
people's self-determination and sovereign rights. 
  [Begin Nunez recording] We have asked nongovernment 
organizations that have the opportunity to speak at 
international forums, and particularly at the United Nations, to 
try to denounce the blockade as the main source of human rights 
violations in Cuba. Cuba is the only Latin American nation that 
has been able to produce specific achievements in the field of 
economic and social rights. This must be recognized and firmly 
pointed out. This is what we are promoting. We are also 
looking for ways to promote standard international laws and 
human rights in order that third-party countries may be 
considered violators of human rights in other nations. 
  Governments violate the human rights of the people in their 
own countries. In terms of the law, it is unimaginable that a 
foreign country be allowed to violate the rights of people in 
another country, but in this case we find that the Cuban 
people's limitations and the deterioration of their health and 
educational services are not the product of the will of the 
Cuban Government but, rather, the result of an action by an 
arrogant government -- namely, the United States. We want to 
find legal mechanisms in order that the U.S. Government may be 
condemned as a human rights violator. Through its actions, this 
government is not only violating Cuba's right to sovereignty and 
self-determination, it is acting against 11 million Cubans. 
[end recording] 
  At the end of the interview, Vilma Nunez spoke about what 
she 
has seen in Cuba. 
  [Begin Nunez recording] I have been able to see first-hand 
that the situation is difficult. I have also seen, however, 
that although the people sometimes appear to be tired, the 
majority of them are optimistic and dedicated to continuing 
their struggle. It is painful to be continually asked to 
continue struggling. In Nicaragua, we sometimes go through this 
experience. We are always being asked to continue struggling, 
but not to be discouraged. This is what we are telling the 
Cuban people: Do not be discouraged. Things have to change. We 
have to find ways to change things. They must realize that they 
have a responsibility, not only to their own future generations, 
to their own children, and their own grandchildren, but also 
because Cuba remains the only hope for the free people of 
America. [end recording]

  [Text] Following meetings at the State Committee for 
Economic Cooperations, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and other 
economic organizations and institutions, preliminary assessments 
allow us to assure you that the Cuba-Guadaloupe trade meeting is 
already showing very positive results. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Julia Mirabal] In the first 
place, as regards financial matters, Mr.(Max Vincent), 
cochairman of the delegation, says: 
  [(Vincent), in French] ...and, (?as I said), the French 
Government is to sign, no doubt within the next (?month), an 
agreement to guarantee investments. Consequently, regarding 
investments, theoretically there should be no problems; and the 
heads of companies are currently working on the matter of 
exchanges. 
  [Mirabal] There are also other results. 
  [(Vincent), in French] ...(?create), on the basis of this 
first contact, is, on the one hand, to (?have) the heads of 
companies (?attend) the fair to be held in Santiago de Cuba and, 
based on that exchange, set up a network of relations that will 
permit us to create, on the basis of that undertaking, the need 
and the desire to come work in Cuba. 
  [Mirabal] One of the steps toward contributing to Cuba's 
communication with that part of the Caribbean is the 
establishment of weekly flights; heretofore, they have been 
sporadic. 
  [(Vincent), in French] Why? Because the potential for 
Guadeloupe companies, on the level of both tourism and trade, is 
very great. 
  [Mirabal] At the end of this brief dialogue, I asked Mr. 
(Vincent) a question to which he responded in Spanish. 
  [(Vincent)] We feel that all the Caribbean Basin countries 
are brothers, like the fingers of a single hand, and that they 
should work together for the well-being of their peoples. 
  [Mirabal] This has been Julia Mirabal reporting on the 
Cuba-Guadeloupe meeting. [end recording]

  [Text] The universities are going to train technicians in 
materials-efficient construction. Spanish experts in building 
materials-efficient housing are in Santiago de Cuba, where they 
will spend three days implementing a training program to turn 
out professionals who have mastered the technique. Eduardo 
Hernandez, head of the habitat commission of the nongovernmental 
organization (Sur) and Inez Sanchez, the representative in Cuba 
of that Spanish institution, exchanged views with the people of 
Santiago on the importance of moving forward in that specialized 
field. 
  Graduate-level courses on restoration and materials 
efficiency in housing construction will begin in Cuban 
universities at the end of this year. The courses will last 15 
days. It is hoped that, nationwide, some 500 technicians and 50 
teachers will be trained in two years.

  [Text] Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, Politburo 
Member and chief of the Armed Forces General Staff, has visited 
Guantanamo defense zones and said that the troops' fighting 
readiness to defend the fatherland is at the level appropriate 
to the areas bordering the Guantanamo Naval Base. 
  Gen. Rosales del Toro said that this readiness, in addition 
to political and other measures, has considerably reduced the 
illegal departure attempts through the area bordering the Yankee 
base: 
  [Begin Rosales del Toro recording] We have managed to make 
this element understand the risks they are running in trying to 
cross through a densely mined area because this represents a 
risk to their lives. I believe this situation provides 
guarantees to prevent menacing situations. We hope this 
situation will continue improving within the next few months. 
[end recording] 
  This shows the high-level political and moral situation 
prevailing in the areas bordering the naval base. Yesterday, a 
delegate from this area reported that the active participation 
of the people has helped to abort illegal departure attempts 
through this sector. 
  In a border brigade unit, Rosales del Toro warned leaders of 
the Union of Young Communists in the five eastern provinces to 
continue improving the selection of young individuals who render 
their general military service near the enemy: 
  [Begin Rosales del Toro recording] We hope the border will 
become a symbol for the youth of current times. Those who are 
deployed to the border area must therefore be true 
representatives of our young people. [end recording]

  [Text] The activists of the U.S.-Cuba Friendship Caravan 
arrive in Havana this afternoon, after having successfully 
dodged more than a few difficulties during the caravan's 
gigantic tour, from the time it began in Canada and several 
different points in the United States until it crossed into 
Mexico and loaded onto a ship the 140 tons of medicines, 
foodstuffs, and other products valued at some $3 million. As we 
have said on several occasions, this solidarity assistance does 
not solve our problems; it is, however, a gesture of enormous 
human value, which our people appreciate. 
  I think it only fair to point out that this time the U.S. 
Customs authorities in Laredo did not give the caravan as hard a 
time as they did last year; although one piece of equipment was 
stopped, no particular desire to obstruct the passage of the 
caravan was observed. 
  In the same way that we do not economize on words 
criticizing 
hostile actions against our country on the part of the profuse 
[profusa] U.S. Administration, we point out this fact, which in 
essence also constitutes a change from preceding years. 
  Other interpretations of this conduct on the part of Laredo 
Customs could be made, without there being a direct 
cause-and-effect relationship. It appears evident that as the 
conviction that these are not times for blockades and that such 
museum pieces of symbolism do no one any good gains ground in 
U.S. political and business sectors, it has little by little 
been turning into a de facto presence and a call to be realistic. 
  Nor can the fact that, for some time, not a few 
administration officials have not been in favor of the embargo 
-- as they call it in North America -- be (?omitted from) the 
analysis. 
  This U.S-Cuba Friendship Caravan, whose activists arrive 
this 
afternoon and will later travel to several provinces to 
symbolically present the shipment arriving next week, has also 
contributed to the determination to open the blockade 
progressively. It is obvious that such a political decision on 
the part of the Clinton administration will not be adopted 
tomorrow. However, the price -- also political -- of not taking 
these factors into account could become significant.

  [Text] Next May, the Mexican organization "For Cuba" [Va 
por Cuba] will send a third shipment that includes over 80 tons 
of lubricating oil, in defiance of the U.S. embargo [embargo] of 
our Caribbean island. The "Oil for Cuba" campaign is in its 
final phase, we already have a figure similar to last year's, 
and the donations continue -- said (Rodolfo Echevarria), 
representative of [words indistinct], who arrived in Havana 
along with over (?250) members of the third Pastors for Peace 
caravan. 
  In a wheelchair because of his progressive neurocerebral 
affliction, Echevarria reported that in the past, the "For Cuba" 
group has sent to the island shipments of lubricants totalling 
175 tons. The organization this time contributed six tons of 
medicines, school supplies, powdered milk, and other articles to 
the Pastors for Peace campaign.

  [Text] Havana, 12 Mar (DPA) -- Pedro Ross, leader of the 
governmental Central Organization of Cuban Trade Unions, CTC, 
admitted today that the problem of economic inefficiency 
aggravates the island's critical situation. 
  "Economic efficiency is the solution to many of the Cuban 
problems that stand in the way of attaining a stable future and 
a more rapid way out of the island's difficult financial 
situation," Ross, also a member of the Communist Party of Cuba's 
Politburo, said. 
  Cuba is experiencing a serious economic situation, the most 
serious since 1959, due to the dismemberment of the Soviet Union 
and the Eastern European bloc. In addition, Cuba's standard of 
living has declined due to shortages ranging from fuel and 
energy to food and consumption goods. Speaking to the morning 
newspaper GRANMA, Ross reported on ideas and proposals that 
arose from the so-called Workers Parliaments, which are being 
held in almost 80,000 places of employment, on the country's 
economic crisis and how to cope with it. 
  According to government sources, the results of these 
meetings will be considered for a special session of the 
National Assembly (Parliament), the date of which has not yet 
been set, to discuss other economic reforms. 
  Ross confirmed both measures to improve efficiency in each 
labor center and the general economy have been discussed during 
these debates in plants and offices, debates which will end on 
16 March. 
  He admitted, however, efficiency must be closely linked to 
internal finances, on which a number of proposals, including 
tightening control on the country's resources, were presented. 
  He also said the nearly 3.5 million workers repudiated 
theft, 
carelessness, dilapidation, illegal acquisitions of wealth, and 
people who profit from the population's needs. 
  The government-run magazine BOHEMIA admitted recently the 
underground economy, or black market, whose operations reached 
incalculable levels last year, draws mainly from state supplies 
and enterprises. 
  Although Ross also admitted the existence of contradicting 
criteria on tax measures, he said there is a general consensus 
on the need to protect essential services such as health, 
education, and social security. 
  After reporting most of the workers regard it as necessary 
to 
eliminate certain free services and subsidize people rather than 
products, Ross said the latter measure inflicts yearly losses 
worth 4 billion pesos on the island economy. (The peso is 
equivalent officially to the U.S. dollar, although on the black 
market one dollar equals 100 pesos). 
  Ross mentioned certain probable measures that will be 
established in the immediate future, such as higher prices on 
nonessential articles, such as rum and cigars, but with 
controlled distribution to try to counter a monopoly. 
  Criticizing strongly union leaders and workers, Ross said he 
confirmed a general lack of information about how much the 
country must pay to buy specific products abroad. People are 
also unaware that the prices of certain products are still the 
same as 20 or 30 years ago, when the cost of raw materials was 
lower. 
  He said after concluding the Workers Parliaments, the 
proposals will start to be debated in the country's 14 provinces 
on Thursday and that on 29 March the CTC National Committee's 
plenary will devote its session to a debate on this subject. 
  The probable measures to be debated in the National 
Assembly's special session include cutting state subsidies, 
reducing the labor force, and introducing an income tax system.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 8 and 12 March. 
  Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 8 March reports that the Efrain 
Alfonso Brigade from Villa Clara has reached 2 million arrobas 
of cane, cut during the current harvest. This brigade has thus 
been granted the Giron Victory Flag for this achievement. This 
is the second brigade to reach 2 million arrobas. The national 
secretariat of the Cuban Workers Federation has sent a 
congratulatory note to this organization, which is committed to 
cutting 3 million arrobas of sugarcane during the current 
harvest. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 9 March 
reports that approximately 60 sources are being developed in 
Holguin to obtain energy. Great progress has been achieved in 
using nonconventional energy sources in this province, following 
national guidelines for energy production, one of the two most 
important programs in the country. In Holguin there are 
currently 458 windmills, 48 biogas plants, 21 minihydroelectric 
dams, and three hydraulic dams, while in 1989 there were only 
five energy sources. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 9 March reports that the 
Ministry of Construction is at present doing remodeling and 
expansion work at eight airports with a view to contributing to 
developing Cuba's tourism infrastructure, and hopes to finish 
the work in 1994. The work is being done at the Jose Marti, 
Varadero, Ciego de Avila, Camaguey, Holguin, Manzanillo, 
Santiago de Cuba, and Cienfuegos airports. Work is also being 
done on landing strips used by tourists in Cayo Coco, Santa 
Lucia, and Mayajigua. More than 14 million pesos will be 
invested in these construction works. 
  In the same newscast, Radio Rebelde reports the members of 
the Eliseo Camano Agricultural-Livestock Cooperative located in 
Piloto, Consolacion del Sur Municipality, Pinar del Rio 
Province, have finished the tobacco planting in 18 of the 20 
caballerias planned for the current campaign. The coop's 
president said the coop expects to harvest a record 5,000 
quintals during the current harvest. The tobacco campaign is 
going extremely well in general in the province. 
  Radio Rebelde also reports that a new therapy room with a 
12-person capacity has been inaugurated at the general hospital 
in Baire, on the Isle of Youth. The installation has the latest 
technology and qualified, experienced personnel. An emergency 
intensive-care room and a cardiovascular-care room with 
sophisticated equipment and specialists of great professional 
prestige also became operative. 
  Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 10 March reports that sugarcane 
planting is increasing in Las Tunas province. Spring sugarcane 
was already planted on 140 caballerias, while 70 more 
caballerias are ready for planting. At the provincial level, 
some 940 caballerias are already in production, while the 
objective is to reach some 1,800 caballerias. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 11 March reports that the 
brigade of voluntary canecutters who work at the Orlando 
Gonzalez sugar complex in Ciego de Avila has sent a letter of 
response to Army General Raul Castro Ruz who congratulated them 
for reaching the first million arrobas of cane cut. Raul Castro 
praises the workers and urges them to increase production. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 12 March reports that the 
Steelworking Industry, the Sime, plans to build some 200 
train-buses [trenbus] in 1994. Jose Aranaburo, vice minister of 
the Steelworking Industry, said that in 1993 the country had no 
financial resources to build these train-buses, but that Sime 
managed to build 10 with its own resources. This year, however, 
this company intends to build some 200 train-buses to be used in 
Havana.

<F P=106> [Report by Fredy Guzman] </F>
  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- In the opinion of Comayagua 
Department deputies, there is no reason for U.S. troops to 
continue being stationed at the Palmerola Military Base. 
However, several deputies believe the presence of U.S. troops 
could be justified if they are used to combat drug traffickers 
or to perform tasks that benefit the population. 
  Recently, President Carlos Roberto Reina said he favored the 
withdrawal of those soldiers. His opinion is shared by other 
sectors of Honduran society. However, on more than one 
occasion, U.S. embassy officials have asserted that the presence 
or withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed here depends on the 
Honduran Government's decision. 
  Liberal Deputy Valentin Suarez said: "The clashes between 
Honduras and El Salvador have ended, and the Nicaraguan and 
Salvadoran guerrillas no longer exist. Thus, the gringo troops 
should be out of Honduras." Suarez added that Hondurans, 
especially the people in the central departments, need Palmerola 
Military Base to turn it into an international airport. "In our 
country's situation, we cannot continue to invest in more 
airports," the deputy emphasized. 
  National Party Deputy Jose Rubio said the withdrawal of U.S. 
troops "is a decision the government must make and the Comayagua 
people should be asked if they want the troops to stay in 
Palmerola or not." 
  Liberal Deputy Donaldo Dominguez asserted that "the Cold War 
era has ended, but we now have to fight other things such as 
drug trafficking. In this respect we could use the help of 
foreign troops. However, we believe that in exchange for this, 
the Honduran Government should receive more from the U.S. 
Government." 
  National Party Deputy Salomon Padilla said that "we have to 
see the positive and negative aspects of the troops' presence. 
The presence of soldiers in our country is no longer necessary 
because the period of violence is over." However, he considers 
that the presence of the U.S. soldiers could be justified if 
they stay to improve roads, build schools, and implement other 
community programs.

  [Editorial Report] Panama City Circuito RPC Television in 
Spanish at 0200 GMT on 9 March broadcasts its 60-minute 
"Democracy 94" program, which features a live or recorded 
interview with Ruben Blades, presidential candidate of the Papa 
Egoro Movement, MPE, by Hugo Enrique Famania. 
  The program begins with a short biographical account of 
Blades' professional, academic, and personal history and is 
followed by the interview. 
  Famania says Blades has proposed a democratization of the 
economic process and asks him to explain the term. Blades 
replies: "We must create conditions that will allow a true 
distribution of economic opportunities." He says this goal will 
be accomplished "in two phases; employment and investment," 
and notes the need to "disperse investment" to the countryside. 
  Famania then asks Blades if he plans to change the entire 
government system, which has traditionally been centralized. 
Blades says "it is not a matter of changing a system but an 
attitude." "We must design a national strategy leading to a 
national economic development plan, which is what we define as 
democratizing the economic process. All provinces must be 
included in this plan." 
  Regarding investments, Blades says that "the reason for the 
current paralysis is simple: We have not defined our national 
economic objectives. The government and the private sector are 
not working together, and the people are waiting to see what 
happens. In reality, no serious steps have been taken to repair 
the national infrastructure or to encourage investment. No 
effort has been made to expedite procedures to facilitate 
investment. No effort has been made to reach a concerted 
agreement among various sectors -- labor, business, and 
government -- as the Mexican Government did in a very 
intelligent move that culminated on 3 October 1993 with a pact 
for stability and employment. We have done absolutely nothing 
to give the country direction. Investment will not come to 
Panama unless we offer investors certain conditions." 
  Famania states: "You have spoken about investments and the 
formula for investment and employment. To what type of 
investment are you referring; state, private, or foreign?" 
Blades responds: "All types," adding that investments in Panama 
"are based on foreign credits, and all our revenues are used for 
public expenses, a situation that should not continue." Further 
on he adds: "Credits should be used for specific objectives that 
will not only create new jobs but will eventually pay the debt." 
  Blades continues: "Our basic problem -- and what has made it 
impossible to renegotiate our debt under favorable terms -- is 
that we are seen as a country that improvises. There is an 
uncertainty that undermines confidence in us, and for that we 
are paying a high price." He then stresses that if the country 
were to present to the international financial institutions "a 
specific program with all our projects, I am sure they would 
agree to grant us anything from a moratorium on debt payments to 
an increase in credits." 
  Asked how he would renegotiate the debt differently from the 
current administration, Blades says: "We must define our 
economic objectives; for example, Panama as an international 
tourist center, a maritime center, a telecommunications center, 
a financial center, and an export center. We must develop rural 
areas. We must create conditions for exports to bring foreign 
exchange to the country." He adds: "We must take immediate 
steps to help the agricultural and industrial sectors define 
their markets." 
  Asked if the country is ready for a commercial opening, 
Blades answers: "No, not yet. We are not prepared for a 
commercial opening. I think that would be crazy" because "it 
would hurt our industries and our small and midsize enterprises." 
  On the subject of privatization, Blades says: "I do not 
agree that privatizing assets has a strategic value for the 
nation because those assets belong to the country." He 
specifically mentions electricity, water, and telephone 
services, clarifying that "some areas in those services could be 
privatized." He notes that there could be some mixed 
enterprises. 
  Blades then elaborates on MPE proposals to reform the Labor 
Code to encourage investment. He says that "the labor and 
business sectors should sit down and study points of contention, 
discuss them, and arrive at a decision" to eliminate any 
perception that could discourage investment. He again uses 
Mexico as an example, saying that "the three sectors had to sit 
down and finally sign a pact of stability, competitiveness, and 
employment in October 1993. We should do the same thing in 
Panama." 
  Regarding the use of price controls on staples to reduce 
poverty, Blades says: "We must look for a solution to and 
directly attack the problems of hunger and poverty in Panama." 
  Famania turns to other topics, asking Blades which option he 
prefers to deal with problems in the health sector: 
coordination, integration, or open coordination with the 
private sector. Blades replies: "We must look for a formula 
among the various groups involved through a concerted effort and 
without excluding anyone." He adds: "We all want efficient and 
continuous health services for everyone at a national level." 
  Blades also reiterates his proposal that the government pay 
its debt to the Social Security Fund, noting that "this is one 
of the most serious problems affecting the Social Security 
Fund." "We must also consider the possibility of privatizing 
some services." 
  Famania says some analysts believe that one of the main 
obstacles to establishing effective public security and police 
forces is a fear of militarism. Blades, however, has proposed 
supporting the National Police with funding and logistical 
support to fight crime and drug trafficking. Famania asks: 
"Aren't you afraid of militarism?" Blades answers: "I am not 
afraid of militarism in that sense. Obviously we need an 
efficient police service with motivated, well equipped, and well 
paid policemen who are respected by everyone." "We must 
realize that we all have to protect the democratic system. I do 
not see why we should be afraid of an efficient, well trained 
police force." Asked "to what extent the country could be 
militarized in the defense of national sovereignty and the 
Panama Canal," Blades replies that "a special team or force 
could be created." He explains that one way to obtain the funds 
needed to raise policemen's salaries would be from the 
confiscated properties of criminals, which would also be a way 
to prevent corruption and bribery. He adds: "I sincerely 
believe that we will not return to the military past. The 
country will not allow that. We must have confidence in the 
police and support them." 
  Blades is then asked for his views on the future of U.S. 
military bases. Famania notes that the MPE's position has been 
that the military bases should not remain in Panama. He asks 
Blades what his plans are for the Panamanian employees and what 
he proposes as a replacement for that parallel economy. Blades 
says: "It is my personal opinion that the current system that 
benefits those employees should not be altered." Regarding the 
military bases, he says: "We believe we can use the areas now 
occupied by those military bases in such a way that the benefit 
from economic development will greatly exceed the economic 
benefits and employment the properties generate today." As for 
use of the reverted properties, Blades says there are many 
proposals, including transferring public offices and using some 
areas for housing projects, all of which will require careful 
study. 
  Commenting on the Interoceanic Region Authority, Blades 
says: 
"I think it is a little dangerous for an institution to 
determine the guidelines for that sector because there could be 
a conflict with the executive branch on the use of those areas. 
I think this situation should be corrected." 
  Asked what kind of relations Panama or a government headed 
by 
the MPE would have with Fidel Castro, Blades replies: "I think 
we should maintain relations with all governments. In Cuba's 
case, we must facilitate an internal democratic transition. I 
see no problem whatsoever in maintaining diplomatic relations 
with Cuba or China."

<F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega; from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate, urged other 
political parties to avoid provocations and refrain from 
engaging in electoral violence. 
  Perez Balladares met with members of the Colon Free Zone 
Users Association today. He explained to the businessmen the 
need to reform the law creating the Free Zone, so as to make it 
more functional and to bring it in line with the demands of the 
world's economic market. 
  According to the PRD leader, if he wins the elections he 
will 
appoint the Free Zone manager from a list of nominees proposed 
by those businessmen. Perez Balladares emphasized the need for 
a Panama City-Colon highway, which will become a reality during 
his administration. 
  [Begin recording] [Perez Balladares] There are between 
12,000 
and 14,000 daily vehicle transits on this road. With 
appropriate tolls, this would translate into high revenues that 
could very well pay for the highway, should it be done by 
private enterprise. This is what we want to do. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What do you think of electoral 
violence and how it affects the PRD, given there has been some 
questioning and the Justice and Peace Commission is conducting 
an investigation? 
  [Perez Balladares] I think certain media, not you, have 
blown 
foolish incidents out of proportion. This must not be 
interpreted as a justification, because I do not justify these 
incidents. We are conducting an investigation so we can punish 
those responsible, if anyone is found, but let me tell you 
something: People usually let their emotions go during the 
political season; consequently, we ask our supporters to avoid 
confrontation. Let's not hold our political rallies at the same 
time our political adversaries do. Although they are not our 
enemies, they are still our adversaries. 
  On the other hand, I call on the media to discourage 
violence 
with ill-intended and false reports. I also urge other parties 
to avoid situations we may regret in the future. [end recording] 
  Perez Balladares said he will observe the Justice and Peace 
Commission's decision on a possible sanction over an alleged 
attack by PRD supporters against members of the PDC [Christian 
Democratic Party] and Arnulfist Party.

<F P=106> [Report by David Gutierrez Lopez] </F>
  [Text] Approximately 7,000 weapons of various calibers have 
been diverted from Nicaragua to drug traffickers in exchange for 
drugs, marine products, clothing, and household appliances, 
according to Lieutenant Colonel Ramon Arnesto Soza, chief of the 
Special Disarmament Brigade (BED). 
  To protect their merchandise, the drug traffickers use AK-47 
rifles, grenade launchers, and RPG-7's manufactured in the 
former Soviet Union. Lately, there has been fear that they may 
even have in their hands the dangerous surface-to-air missiles, 
known as Redeyes, produced in sophisticated U.S. weapons 
factories. 
  It was estimated that in 1991 in Nicaragua there were 
approximately 80,000 weapons dispersed in the hands of civilians 
and armed groups. The disarmament process has secured 53,000 
weapons of all types, said Ramon Arnesto Soza, during an 
exclusive interview with BARRICADA. It is also estimated that 
there are more than 150,000 explosive devices throughout the 
nation. There are still areas in the country that are 
completely mined where EPS [Sandinist People's Army] sappers 
have discontinued their operation due to lack of funds. 
  The military chief said: "The traffic of weapons diverted to 
drug traffickers is carried out in the Nicaraguan Atlantic area. 
Groups of Miskitos [Indian group] exchange rifles for drugs and 
other things." He added that thousands of weapons have escaped 
over the Honduran and Costa Rican borders. These weapons had 
arrived in Nicaragua through what is now Russia in the last 
decade to defend the nation from the war financed by the U.S. 
Government at that time. 
  Based on these numbers, there are still 27,000 weapons that 
have to be recovered; most of these are AK-47's. To secure 
these, approximately "3 million cordobas are required to offer 
cash in exchange for the weapons," said the BED chief who has 
led the disarmament of all the rearmed groups. This mission will 
conclude with the disarmament of the 3-80 Northern Front. 
  There are still approximately 700 armed men organized in 
small groups devoted to thievery and the kidnapping of peasants 
on the roads and highways, particularly in the northern part of 
the country. 
  The BED has disarmed 130 groups of rearmed men who operated 
in different parts of the nation's territory, among them 9,000 
pro- Sandinist and 14,000 recontras of the Nicaraguan 
Resistance, Yatamas [Indian group], etc. 
  Disarming in exchange for cash, food, and other benefits 
supported by several nations is at a standstill due to a lack of 
funds. Currently, endeavors are being undertaken to secure 
enough cash to resume the program. 
  The 3-80 Northern Front members will be allowed to keep 
their 
small weapons -- pistols and revolvers. They will be allowed to 
carry these legally once they turn in their war weapons. 
Subsequently, some will join the police, while others will go 
the fields to work. 
  In the coming months the BED that was initially comprised of 
619 men -- between EPS soldiers and former contras -- will 
definitely disappear after they disarm El Chacal's men. These 
men are considered the last remnants of the recontras who took 
up arms again as a result of President Violeta Chamorro 
government's nonfulfillment of commitments. 
  Currently the BED has been reduced to barely 70 men who, 
once 
the last demobilization is carried out on 8 April, will be able 
to join the EPS to engage in other missions, Arnesto Soza said.

  [Text] National human rights organizations have reiterated 
their concern about the continuous deportations of Nicaraguans 
from the United States, and they warn "if this continues, it 
will become a critical problem for Nicaraguan families that 
receive remittances in dollars." 
  Doctor Bayardo Izaba Solis, of the Nicaraguan Human Rights 
Center (Cenidh), has said "this is the prelude to a process that 
might result in large-scale deportations, and this would 
negatively affect Nicaraguan families." 
  He has added the United States has granted asylum to the 
Nicaraguans who so requested during the previous decade, so it 
can do likewise now and help them again, and this attitude 
should not only be the result of a given situation and for 
political purposes. 
  The human rights violations expert has said many people--he 
did not specify how many--have requested letters or affidavits 
that state they have been subject to political persecution in 
Nicaragua, and they must remain in the United States in the 
interim. 
  Izaba has said U.S. immigration authorities must grant them 
some type of special immigrant status, and this will allow the 
Nicaraguan economy to recover slowly and be able to receive all 
the people deported from the United States. 
  Doctor Violeta de Sandino, assistant director of the 
Nicaraguan Human Rights Association (ANPDH), has told BARRICADA 
"we have spoken in Washington and said conditions are not 
favorable for these Nicaraguans to return to their country, and 
their cases should be reviewed." 
  "We believe a large-scale deportation would worsen the 
economic situation of the country and the families that receive 
dollar remittances," Violeta has said. 
  Sandino has said the ANPDH endorses an extension of the 
Nicaraguans' permanence in the United States, adding the 
political asylum demands submitted to the U.S. Government should 
be expedited.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos F. Chamorro B.] </F>
  [Text] Because of that inclination from which we suffer for 
enthusiastically aggrandizing the people's struggles without 
engaging in any critical effort to review their blunders, the 
failure of the recent transport strike headed by the National 
Transport Council (CNT) went nearly unnoticed. 
  Attempting to be constructive, I would like to share a 
number 
of reflections not unrelated to those now being debated by the 
Sandinist Front concerning our methods of struggle and their 
relationship to the people's struggles. 
  The circumstances in which this strike took place were in 
total contrast with those that existed in September 1993, when 
the transport movement succeeded in representing the national 
consensus and heading up a vote of censure of the government's 
economic policy. That was a broader movement. This one was more 
focused, but influenced by other factors. 
  In the case at hand, the National Workers Front (CNT) had 
differing opinions about the viability of gaining widespread 
support for the movement. This in turn had an undeniable effect 
on the CNT's decision to try to show its own capacity for 
leadership. 
  Whatever the real reasons may have been--some allude to a 
background of competence for potential leadership of the CST 
[Sandinist Workers Federation]--these are matters deserving of 
serious review, given the results of the strike. 
  One little-known fact--at least in terms of the public--is 
that by calling off the strike Tuesday night, the CNT obtained 
nothing more than what had already been obtained by the other 
federations that signed an agreement with the government 
Saturday morning. The strike was suspended in exchange for a 
promise of talks and negotiations which others had already 
obtained at a lower cost. 
  The CNT leadership squandered the strike's peak of strength 
and political legitimacy last Friday, when negotiations were 
opened with the government as a result of pressure brought by 
the strike and with the participation of five other transport 
federations. At the precise moment that the CNT could have 
exerted the most influence by placing itself at the head of the 
negotiations, in order to put forward the just demands of the 
transport workers pitted against the government, it let itself 
get caught up in a hegemonic position. 
  The result was an overestimation of its own forces, which 
led 
them to underestimate other natural allies. This in turn made 
the division of the movement which the government had sought 
from the very beginning a far easier task. The CNT subsequently 
went about maintaining its own strike without being able to 
control acts of violence targeting other transport workers. This 
objectively weakened the vitality and legitimacy of the program. 
  An evaluation of this movement yields several troublesome 
conclusions, the most important of them being the need to take a 
new look at the conditions in which strikes are waged and the 
methods of struggle for promoting and effectively achieving 
their objectives, or at least part of them. 
  The best alternative would never be to stand idly by and 
abandon the strike tactic and methods of popular pressure. 
Rather, we must rethink the conditions under which strikes can 
be staged victoriously. 
  It is sad to admit it, but it would be even worse to stick 
our heads in the sand and refuse to recognize that this defeat 
has weakened an irrenounceable instrument of the people's 
struggle, which the strike is. 
  Social and trade union movements that follow this transport 
strike will have to meditate long and hard on their future 
steps. They must gauge their strength, identify their allies, 
choose more flexible methods of struggle in order to achieve a 
consensus, and clearly define objectives. 
  The Sandinist Front must take the same self-critical vision, 
reviewing its actions and political positions on the strike. 
Although this was indeed an autonomous movement of transport 
workers, we cannot deny that, having been defeated despite the 
support of Sandinists for its demands, the FSLN [Snadinist 
National Liberation Front] must share in the repercussions in 
order to draw lessons that will improve its leadership of coming 
contests.

  [Text] In reaction to the parliamentary plan approved by 
the lower chamber, National Front for Change and Democracy 
Parliamentary Bloc [BP-FNCD] President, Deputy Fignole 
Jean-Louis, says this plan was developed at the initiative of 
the U.S. State Department. He holds the U.S. Government 
responsible for the current situation in the country: 
  [Begin Jean-Louis recording, in Creole] All the actions 
being 
taken by my colleagues, including deputies and senators, have 
been dictated by the State Department. We know this very well. 
The State Department has already forced the parliament, 
including deputies, senators, and the president, to take a 
number of measures such as -- you recall -- the Washington 
agreement. These same men had the president sign it, and got the 
parliament involved. Once we arrived here, they gave us no 
support for voting on the agreement, which could have ended the 
crisis. 
  Second, they had us go to Governors Island, then in an 
underhanded manner, sabotaged the Governors Island Agreement. 
Consequently, it could not be implemented. They had us 
participate in the New York pact for the normalization of 
parliament, then encouraged the 18 January parliamentarians to 
create all the disturbances you now see going on. You know what 
happened in the Senate on 9 March. [end recording]

  [Text] Regarding the conflict in the Senate of the Republic 
for control of the presidency, Senator Bernard Sansaricq has 
revealed the initial elements in an investigation of the 
management of the quaestorship of the rival office. The main 
target is former quaestor Sen. Julio Larosiliere who is today 
accused of embezzlement. According to Edner Jean, it is in fact 
the new weapon being used in the battle between the senatorial 
blocs. Let us listen to his report: 
  [Begin recording] [Jean] It is a cynical and macabre game 
that is currently being played in the Senate of the Republic in 
which any type of blow is allowed, featuring the bid for power 
that took Bernard Sansaricq to the head of the Senate and Firmin 
Jean-Louis' attempt to get his seat back. Since then, the 
attacks and counterattacks have been launched from both camps. 
On 8 March, when armed civilians showed up to support the office 
of Sen. Sansaricq, the battle for power took a definitive new 
turn: the dialectic of weapons. 
  Today this Indian-wrestling match appears to be a settling 
of 
scores between the two quaestors, Julio Larosiliere, who cut off 
the means of subsistence to senators of the GARD [Action Group 
For the Recovery and Defense of National Sovereignty] and Osny 
Eugene, whose signing right is no longer recognized by the 
Ministry of Finance. 
  Meanwhile, to occupy his time, the quaestor of the Sansaricq 
office has involved himself in an investigation into the 
management of Sen. Larosiliere. On 10 March, during a news 
conference, Osny Eugene presented the first elements in this 
process. His control of the accounting and management of the 
Senate of the Republic will allegedly prove that Julio 
Larosiliere practiced embezzlement of the quaestorship funds. It 
should be noted that this is not Osny Eugene's first revelation 
on this matter. Just to show that he will give no gifts to his 
main opponent in this clan warfare, Osny is attacking Julio 
through his previous positions. 
  [Eugene] Sen. Larosiliere says that we do not respect 
the New York pact. I would like him to tell us whether he 
respected the CEP [Permanent Electoral Council] Act that he 
signed, the same CEP to which he appointed his cousin as 
treasurer. I would like to ask him if he respected the act of 
validation of power of the 18 January senators. Today, for 
personal reasons, he no longer recognizes them. I would like him 
to confirm that he respected his own signature before he asks us 
today to respect ours. Now, if he recognizes that he did not 
respect his signature, he must find the courage to come to the 
session room, resolve the conflict that he has with us, and 
agree that from now on we establish the rules of the game and 
respect the same principles for all. It is not a matter of 
questioning this office. 
  This office has been legally elected. This office has 
not been acclaimed. They [not further identified] will come as 
simple senators and defend their viewpoints and simply continue 
with their mandate. They have no other choice. 
  I must tell you that I strongly wish that Sen. 
Larosiliere would take the necessary steps for once because ever 
since Sen. Larosilere has been quaestor, he has never submitted 
a report on financial operations, nor on the institution's file, 
since August 1991. 
  [Jean] Meanwhile, the most senior member, Sen. Franck 
Leonard, who has acknowledged the antagonistic offices, attempts 
to call the wise, quote, to reason, unquote. 
  [Leonard] I met with Jean-Louis' office, and I met with 
Sansaricq's office. My words are words of wisdom. I am working 
so brothers who are separated over some triviality, some 
quarrel, can again speak to each other. 
  [Jean] What are your hopes, Senator? 
  [Leonard] My hope is that the country can move forward. I am 
trying to reconcile everyone. [end recording] 
  [Jean] Here is a Haitian mediator in a Haitian crisis. 
However, to carry out his mission, Sen. Leonard will need not 
only determination, but nerves of steel. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The Haitian Army may support the plan proposed 
by parliamentarians to get the country out of deadlock, despite 
the reservations of General Raoul Cedras, according to Deputy 
Jean Eddy Talendier Desjardins of Tiburon. He thinks that one 
of the reasons for Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's 
rejection of this plan is supposedly that it was going to be 
approved by the Army. Daly Valet interviewed Desjardins: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Desjardins] I am not 
disappointed, because I was there; I experienced all the events 
and I knew Aristide would not agree. That is the reason we 
entered here especially to meet with the Army because you know 
you have [changes thought] this plan involves [preceding word in 
English] the Army too. So (?we wanted) to see whether the Army 
would not agree as well; but we knew that Aristide would not 
agree. The reason is that most of the time Aristide agrees with 
what he believes the Army will not accept and disagrees when he 
feels that the Army will agree. Perhaps -- feeling that the Army 
would agree with the plan even if it does not agree now, that it 
will eventually agree with the plan -- Aristide will not, that 
is all. 
  [Valet] What is your position concerning the Army? It is 
said 
that the Army has reservations regarding this plan. What is your 
stance? 
  [Desjardins] Yes, it says he has reservations, but it does 
not say it does not agree. I represented -- I do not say I 
unofficially represented the Army, but as a National Cooperative 
Action Movement deputy, they present me as a neo-Duvalierist -- 
I realized that my duty was to defend the Army because.... 
[pauses] It is always said that the Army of a country is that 
country's honor. I know that if I criticize the Army, I 
automatically criticize my country. So I was obliged to defend 
the Army. [passage omitted] 
  [Valet] As for Gen. Cedras' departure: Do you think the Army 
agrees or, at least, as you say you are close to the Army, do 
you think the Army has consented to the general's departure? 
  [Desjardins] I do not say that I am close to the Army. I 
said 
that I am a member of the 30 September [1991] family. So, if I 
am a member of the 30 September group, this automatically means 
that I am part of the Army. I cannot tell you that Gen. Cedras 
has agreed with it 100 percent; but I believe that if he studies 
the plan and identifies with it, he will agree. [end recording]
