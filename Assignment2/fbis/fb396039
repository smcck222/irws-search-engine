<F P=106> [Article by journalist Luis Alberto Chavez and photographer </F>
Cesar Aquije] 
  [Excerpt] General Alfredo Rodriguez Riveros has replaced 
General Eduardo Bellido Mora, currently assigned to Israel, as 
commander of the Huallaga Front. He handles the last refuge of 
subversion and the natural habitat of drug traffickers: the San 
Martin and Huanuco Departments. This is an explosive zone, but 
he is not worried, because in some ways he knows the situation: 
"El Cholo," as he is known, was the political-military chief of 
Cerro de Pasco before being assigned to Upper Huallaga. 
  Although he did not elaborate, when asked about accusations 
that the Army is linked with trafficking, the general said he 
was inflexible over detecting and sanctioning any cases of 
immorality in his institution. 
  If there were any doubts about his intentions, a few days 
after taking over the Huallaga Front command he sanctioned an 
officer. It was a warning for everyone. 
  It is incredible but Rodriguez Riveros is ready to show -- 
papers in hand -- that not a single light plane has entered the 
Upper Huallaga zone so far this year. Daily DEA reports confirm 
this. 
  He said that although the Army was responsible for 
coordinating the struggle against trafficking, he was not in 
charge of direct interventions. The police have that 
responsibility. 
  Today that situation has changed. In October 1993, a decree 
was issued stating that in emergency zones the Army fights 
subversion and drug trafficking. 
  All antinarcotics operations by any of the forces in Upper 
Huallaga (National Police, Air Force, or DEA) must be cleared in 
advance with the Huallaga Front commander. No operation is 
authorized without Army coordination. 
  "The control of drug trafficking is an objective today," 
said 
Gen. Alfredo Rodriguez Riveros during this interview that was 
arranged in principle as "a conversation," but which thanks to 
his kindness was authorized for publication. 
  [Chavez] Army members have been accused of maintaining 
contacts with drug traffickers. What is your opinion on these 
charges? 
  [Rodriguez] The commander reacted positively. Last year we 
had three inspections. This year we will have four. Perhaps 
out of fear, mistakes used to occur internally, within the 
units. Each commander had his policy and made his own decisions 
on penalties against his troops and on how to correct 
wrongdoings. This policy changed in 1992 and 1993. Officers 
are no longer reported to their commanders within the larger 
units; they are reported to the Army Inspector's Office and then 
to the Military Justice Supreme Council. 
  [Chavez] How many cases are being investigated in the 
Huallaga Front? 
  [Rodriguez] We already have investigated 15 cases. These 
cases are duly documented and ready for sentencing. The 
sentence will vary according to the degree of participation: 
They may be removed from the Army, placed at the disposal of the 
commander, retired, or referred to civilian courts. 
  [Chavez] Have you reported any cases since you were 
appointed 
as the Huallaga Front political and military chief? 
  [Rodriguez] Yes. I reported a case 24 hours after I 
discovered it. The problem was an old one, but we detected it. 
Our commander is aware of the case and documents are being 
prepared for his trial. 
  [Chavez] Who is he? 
  [Rodriguez] An officer. We caught him in the simplest of 
ways. He was attending a meeting outside the base and we looked 
for him because he left the base. During the investigation we 
learned that the officer "met" with a group (of drug 
traffickers). The rest followed this lead. I am unable to give 
you his name because he is still on trial. 
  Let us just say this was a message for all officers assigned 
to the Upper Huallaga front. 
  I think we have all come here with the same spirit: To work 
for our fatherland and to work for our institution. 
  [Chavez] In other words, a war with a loud warning does not 
kill people. 
  [Rodriguez] That is right. 
  [Chavez] How do you detect an officer involved in 
trafficking? Only through the inspectors? 
  [Rodriguez] There are various ways. One is through his 
lifestyle. With our salaries we cannot have certain luxuries. 
These people are also known for the way they talk. We are not 
isolated from society. We participate in all social activities 
and social meetings. Another way to detect them is by the way 
they brag about the money they have. This prompts us to 
investigate. 
  [Chavez] General, is this a certain "esprit de corps," 
seeking to cover up mistakes made by some officer? 
  [Rodriguez] This command has never allowed that to happen 
for 
ethical reasons. We will not cover up for anyone. Our 
commanders understand that trafficking is a scourge we must 
eliminate. That was the reason behind the law authorizing us to 
directly intervene in the fight to eliminate trafficking. 
  [Chavez] What can you do to prevent further corruption? 
  [Rodriguez] It is very difficult to be inside every 
officer's 
head. We are implementing measures, for example, by rotating 
duties. We think it is harmful for an officer to stay too long 
at one particular base. The social interaction with people in 
the zone could make him feel secure and might tempt him to get 
involved in illegal activities. 
  [Chavez] What can you tell us about the illegal drug trade? 
Is it moving somewhere else? 
  [Rodriguez] We have information that trafficking activities 
are gradually moving toward Loreto and Madre de Dios, that is, 
outside San Martin and Huanuco. We no longer see opulence in 
shopping malls. We see abandoned towns. Tocache and Uchiza 
used to be trafficking centers, but today these towns lack the 
economic resources to continue to develop. 
  [Chavez] So trafficking is moving to Loreto and Madre de 
Dios? 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, at least according to the information we 
have. We work day and night to detect light planes. 
  [Chavez] With what results? 
  [Rodriguez] Results have been negative lately. They no 
longer come to this area. If they do, it is not like in the 
past, that is, three to four times a day. They come once a 
month and run the risk of being caught. 
  [Chavez] How can you be sure if the Army does not have the 
adequate technological means to detect light planes flying at 
night, which is when traffickers move? 
  [Rodriguez] We work with the DEA. They can detect planes 
with their radar in Yurimaguas. They transmit the information 
to the Huallaga Front and we re-transmit it to the base closest 
to where the plane might land. 
  [Chavez] Does that mean the DEA tells you the exact moment a 
small plane enters Upper Huallaga? 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, it takes us an average of two minutes to 
learn about it. 
  [Chavez] Do you depend on information supplied by the DEA? 
  [Rodriguez] That's right. 
  [Chavez] How often do you receive DEA reports? 
  [Rodriguez] Daily. 
  [Chavez] How many small planes enter the region daily? 
  [Rodriguez] Currently, none enters this region. This is why 
we are seeking other possible routes (ground and river routes) 
for drug trafficking. 
  [Chavez] The people, however, say that they see small planes 
entering the region. 
  [Rodriguez] Well, they may say planes arrive here all the 
time. It may have occurred before. 
  [Chavez] According to your reports, when did the last plane 
enter the region? 
  [Rodriguez] We do not have this data. 
  [Chavez] Are you telling me that so far this year no plane 
has entered the Upper Huallaga region? 
  [Rodriguez] That's right. 
  [Chavez] Are you sure? 
  [Rodriguez] I repeat, according to our reports, no plane has 
entered the region. They are probably seeking other routes -- 
probably along rivers or roads. In the 90 days we have been 
here, no flights or large shipments have been reported. 
  [Chavez] Do you think the Intelligence Service is mistaken, 
general? 
  [Rodriguez] I don't think so. 
  [Chavez] What do you believe is the main problem in 1994: 
The Shining Path or trafficking? 
  [Rodriguez] They go together. In the field of subversion two 
areas interest us: Sisa and Tingo Maria. Although we have 
temporarily neutralized Sisa, we want to clearly identify the 
group to be able to dismantle it. This, however, does not apply 
to Tingo Maria in Leoncio Prado Province, where there are 
permanent clashes. Both sides have casualties. It will take 
some time to resolve. The problem will not disappear in the 
near future, but we are sure we will finally eliminate them. 
  [Chavez] President Fujimori said in Colombia that the 
millions of dollars invested by the United States in the 
antinarcotics effort have yielded no results. What do you think 
of that? 
  [Rodriguez] Considering the actions so far, I could not 
comment on the issue. I have been here for too short a time. 
Talking with the people who live here, however, I have learned 
that they believe funds should not be allocated to the 
antinarcotics effort but to the coca replacement program. Rice, 
yerbaluisa, corn, and grapes are the most promising products in 
the region. Grapes, for example, are harvested three times in a 
year here while near the coast they are harvested only once. 
This occurs at the Cumbaza Valley, where grapes are harvested 
three times a year. That is why coca is not planted there. 
  [Chavez] Do you believe that in addition to being an 
economic, police, and moral problem, coca growing is also a 
social problem? 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, but this problem can be solved by helping 
the most needy people and by bringing together all institutions 
in an effort to find solutions to their problems. Those who 
told us they were ignorant and as a result they grew coca can 
now improve by growing more profitable products. 
  [Chavez] Do you believe peasants grow coca because they are 
ignorant? 
  [Rodriguez] Not because they are ignorant. I believe that at 
a certain moment they were pressed to do it and that for a while 
it was the most profitable crop. 
  [Chavez] What about poppies? 
  [Rodriguez] We have been patrolling the forest for 30 days 
looking for the sites where poppies were allegedly being grown. 
We have found nothing, but we will continue to look. [passage

  [Text] The Peruvian Institute of Nuclear Energy (IPEN) has 
implemented the largest national project in the field of science 
and technology: the construction of the Oscar Miro Quesada de 
la Guerra-Racso Center for Nuclear Research [Centro Nuclear de 
Investigaciones Oscar Miro Quesada de la Guerra-Racso]. 
  Located 40 km north of Lima in the region known as 
Huarangal, 
the nuclear center is a small science and technology citadel 
where a group of professionals and technicians specialized in 
various subjects are developing a series of activities 
applicable to nuclear energy. 
  The center's most important component is its investigations 
reactor called RP-10 (10 megawatts of thermal power) with four 
radial tubes [tubos radiales] and one tangential tubo [tubo 
tangencial]. The reactor's core contains MTR [materials-testing 
reactor]-type fuel with uranium enriched by 20 percent in which 
various samples are lowered for the production of radioisotopes, 
studies on the behavior of materials under neutron irradiation, 
neutrography [neutrografia], and diffraction and fission traces. 
  Another important plant component is the radioisotope 
production plant, which entails a series of laboratories located 
next to the reactor that are used for the production, quality 
control, and development of radioisotopes and irradiated 
[marcadas] molecules. 
  In addition to the nuclear center, IPEN has at its main 
headquarters in San Borja a test reactor (RP-0), a 14 MeV 
neutron generator, two gamma irradiators, and several 
laboratories engaged in projects such as the irradiation of 
food, isotopic hydrology [hidrologia isotopica], non-destructive 
tests, and gauging. 
  The Lima, Arequipa, and Trujillo nuclear medicine centers, 
which in addition to rendering routine services also carry out 
training, research, and development programs, are also part of 
IPEN's infrastructure acquired with the support and cooperation 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency.

<F P=106> [Report by Paola Badaracco] </F>
  [Excerpt] Interior Relations Minister Ramon Escovar Salom 
said yesterday that investigations into the listening devices 
discovered at Miraflores Presidential Palace are still in a 
preliminary phase. "The courts are investigating and that is why 
I do not want to say anything about it. Period." 
  He said there is nothing extraordinary about a case like 
this 
being investigated because this type of investigation occurs 
routinely. The interior minister called attention to the fact 
that when he was presidency secretary general, he requested 
several electronic searches of his and the president's offices. 
He also acknowledged that when he was in charge of the Office of 
the Prosecutor General, he would order electronic searches every 
10 days because there were too many people who were tempted to 
listen in on what was being said. He said that one time, the 
electronic searches discovered a transmission device, but it did 
not go anywhere specific because it had been discarded for some 
time. 
  The minister did not want to confirm whether an espionage 
center connected to La Torre de Las Delicias, the Defense 
Ministry, and Banco Latino really did exist. "I do not want to 
comment on that issue because I am waiting for some information." 
  According to the minister, his office constantly has this 
problem, and this is one reason why electronic searches are 
routinely conducted. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Adela Leal] </F>
  [Text] Speaking before Congress, Defense Minister General 
Rafael Angel Montero Revette stressed his ministry does not 
approve of the draft amnesty law now pending before Congress and 
which would benefit the 4 February and 27 November 1992 
coupists, because its approval would represent the 
institutionalization of military coups. 
  The minister made this statement after being summoned before 
the Interior Policy Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, which 
wanted to hear his views on the draft amnesty law. The 
commission is collecting information to determine procedures for 
handling the rebels who participated in the 1992 military 
uprisings, as well as procedures under which charges can be 
dropped. 
  Gen. Montero Revette said although he is not familiar with 
the text of the draft amnesty law, and although he cannot oppose 
any congressional debate or approval of the law, "we cannot 
grant a blanket pardon to all officers who participated in the 
foiled coup attempts." There are some officers who cannot 
return to their military institutions because they adopted 
political stands and have made political statements. He 
explained that the draft amnesty law contradicts military 
principles that endorse handling such cases on a case-by-case 
basis and not by way of a general policy. In other words, 
within the military, each case is unique unto itself. 
  Gen. Montero Revette pointed out that the Defense Ministry 
will expedite the dropping of charges by studying each case 
individually. He added that this policy was recommended by the 
office of President Rafael Caldera as a means for resolving the 
cases of the arrested military officers. He said that so far 
charges have been dismissed against 319 rebels -- 270 before the 
new government was installed, 10 by decision of court-martial, 
and 39 since 2 February. As part of an effort to quickly 
resolve the problem, he said that last Sunday a military 
commission led by Army Chief of Staff Gen. Nicolas Valencia 
Vivas went to Peru to negotiate the return of those servicemen 
who have sought asylum in Peru. 
  The minister denied that an offer will be made to those who 
are imprisoned to exchange their freedom for a discharge from 
the Armed Forces. He also said it is not true that those who 
have been released are being harassed, adding that they are not 
being given any command posts and are constantly being rotated. 
The minister explained that those who have requested a 
discharge have been offered help in finding a job. Those who 
return to the Armed Forces are kept "under observation" for one 
year, while their commanding officer prepares monthly 
evaluations. At the end of one year, they are then assigned 
command posts. 
  Gen. Montero Revette stressed that under no circumstances 
should this be considered a witch hunt. He added that there are 
not enough intelligence officers to conduct an individual 
follow-up on each person against whom charges have been dropped. 
Referring to the case of Commander Hugo Chavez Frias, Gen. 
Montero Revette reiterated that Chavez Frias has expressed his 
wish to be the last person released, adding that his wish is 
being respected. The general indicated there was little chance 
of Chavez Frias returning to the FAN [National Armed Forces] 
because his case is one of "the most complex, considering he was 
the leader of the uprising." 
  On another subject, the defense minister said that his 
ministry has abolished what seemed to be a policy of 
investigating and arresting civilians for voicing opinions 
through the media. Currently, no civilian is under arrest in 
connection with the uprisings. The Defense Ministry's policy is 
not to open a case against civilians for voicing opinions to the 
press. To facilitate the process, we have decided that any 
necessary information must be coordinated with the ministry 
through its various departments. [sentence as published] 
  In conclusion, he said there have been some changes in the 
military institutions, and he invited the deputies to provide 
the names of those "officers who are members of AD [Democratic 
Action], Copei [Social Christian Party], National Convergence, 
and Radical Cause" in order that necessary steps can be taken. 
The politization of the Armed Forces will not be permitted as 
far as military promotions are concerned, because this is being 
used as an argument for not accepting into the FAN anyone who 
has publicly voiced political opinions.

<F P=106> [From the "NTC News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] It was believed that one of the first victims of the 
internal Medellin Cartel feud was Jose Antonio Ocampo, alias 
Peluza. According to several reports, Ocampo, who was one of 
Pablo Escobar's lieutenants, was murdered after falling from the 
drug lord's graces. The name of Jose Antonio Ocampo appears in 
classified official files as an active member of the financial 
branch of the battered Medellin Cartel. The Army's 4th Brigade 
arrested him in Uraba in 1989, but he was released because of 
insufficient evidence. The authorities know he contributed to 
maintaining the narco-terrorist war for years. He rebelled 
against his boss and Escobar sentenced him to death. Peluza 
managed to escape the internal purge launched against Moncada 
and Galiano at the Envigado Prison complex. 
  Authorities have a video tape that proves Peluza is alive 
and 
well. NTC News, exclusively, has managed to get a hold of the 
tape. Jose Antonio Ocampo is currently being held hostage. 
  [Begin Ocampo recording] I am very happy to be able to send 
this message. [end recording] 
  These pictures show Jose Antonio Ocampo, alias Peluza, where 
he is being held. He looks bad. Two men bearing submachine guns 
guard him. Peluza taped a dramatic call to his family to save 
his life. 
  [Begin Ocampo recording] I hope and I know that you are 
praying to [words indistinct], my and your queen, for me to 
leave here. A thousand kisses. I love you all very much. [end 
recording] 
  On the tape, Peluza asks his family to act wisely. He begs 
his friends for solidarity. He orders his family to sell his 
properties and horses to collect the $2 million ransom.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 16 MAR (EFE) -- The Emisoras 
Caracol Network has reported that "within the next few hours" 
four lieutenants of the late Medellin Cartel boss Pablo Escobar 
will be transferred to Itagui Maximum Security Prison in the 
northwestern part of the nation. 
  A Caracol correspondent has reported that inmates Gustavo 
Adolfo Gutierrez Arrubla (alias Maxwell and La Trapeadora), Luis 
Carlos Aguilar Gallego (El Mugre), Jose Fernando Posadas Fierro, 
and Carlos Mario Alzate Urquijo (Arete) are scheduled to be 
transferred to Itagui. On 8 December 1993, the four confessed 
drug-traffickers were unexpectedly transferred to Santa Fe de 
Bogota's La Picota Prison. 
  The Caracol Network reports the inmates are being 
transferred 
to Itagui "despite recommendations against such a move by the 
national government." Two weeks ago, a conflict arose between 
Colombia's justice minister and the nation's prosecutor general 
because the minister opposed the order to transfer the inmates 
to another prison, warning that the transfer could help the 
dismantled Medellin Cartel reunite despite Pablo Escobar's 
December 1993 death. 
  Meanwhile in Medellin, it has been reported that the widow 
of 
Pablo Escobar, Victoria Henao, today visited her brother-in-law 
Roberto, alias Osito, at Itagui Prison. Victoria Henao traveled 
with her son Juan Pablo from her home in the Colombian capital 
to Medellin, where she stayed only a few hours. In the 
afternoon she returned to the Colombian capital aboard a charter 
flight.

<F P=106> ["Confidential" report by Darcy Queen; from the "24 Hours </F>
Newscast"] 
  [Text] Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta has left 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff alone in the fight 
concerning the policy over the Cali Cartel members' surrender to 
justice authorities. During an informal meeting with foreign 
journalists he said the Colombian Government does not welcome 
the fight between the prosecutor general and U.S. Attorney 
General Janet Reno. 
  Attorney General Arrieta rejected what the prosecutor 
general 
said in what represents a struggle for power that goes beyond 
Colombia's borders. In the meeting Arrieta said that the 
Colombian Government does not agree with the prosecutor 
general's position or academic views concerning his U.S. 
counterpart, Janet Reno. 
  Nevertheless, he said Reno's noncompromising attitude 
encourages solidarity with the prosecutor general, which was not 
advisable for the Colombian Government because it is concerned 
that this fight obstructs the surrender process. 
  Immediately after the meeting an ASSOCIATED PRESS report 
said: Arrieta stated his concern that drug traffickers might 
fish in troubled waters if the confrontation continues.

Colombian and Jamaican Governments have ratified the Maritime 
Delimitation Treaty, which establishes a common area for the 
joint control and exploitation of marine flora and fauna. 
Jamaican Ambassador to Colombia Mattew Antoni Cox Beaubrun and 
Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin signed the document restating both 
governments' desire to jointly manage marine resources. 
  According to the document, the common area excludes the 
maritime zone around the Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo Banks 
because, in accordance with international law, that area is 
considered to be part of Colombian territory. In this manner, 
Colombia and Jamaica will be able to exploit the reserves or 
hydrocarbon fields that might be found in the designated area, 
and which might intersect the maritime border. 
  The treaty, ratified on 14 March, was signed in Kingston, 
Jamaica on 12 November 1993, after 19 years of negotiations 
between representatives from both nations. Known as the 
Sanin-Robertson Treaty, the agreement establishes a maritime 
delimitation line between Colombian territory, a common area 
located between the San Andres and Providence Archipelago, and 
Jamaican territory. 
  President Cesar Gaviria called the agreement "historic," and 
noted: "It will not only mark our boundaries in the Caribbean 
sea, but it will make us true neighbors."

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 15 March (NOTIMEX) -- Today, 
Colombian Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos denied a 
Cuban report that he would travel to Cuba in April to sign a 
trade agreement between the two nations. "My schedule is full," 
the official said in statements published Tuesday in the 
influential newspaper EL TIEMPO. 
  According to media reports from Cuba, the two countries will 
sign a trade agreement in Havana next April at a ceremony which 
Santos will attend. "My visit to Cuba is still not definite", 
the Colombian trade minister said in explaining that "the 
agreement only revises the partial agreement Colombia has with 
Cuba within the framework of the Latin American Integration 
Association (ALADI)." 
  According to Cuban versions, a bilateral delegation recently 
studied the treaty. It reviewed tariffs and analyzed a list of 
more than 800 products to be included in the document. 
  Santos' denial was made within the framework of an offensive 
against Cuba by local right-wing groups as a result of the 
release of information on the presumed presence of Colombian 
guerrilla commanders in Cuba. 
  The Santa Fe de Bogota newspaper EL TIEMPO published this 
story shortly after Mines and Energy Minister Guido Nule 
returned from Cuba and announced Colombia would sell between 
15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil per day to the island. Colombia 
and Cuba renewed diplomatic relations on 28 October after a 
12-year suspension given the Cuban Government's presumed 
interference in Colombia's internal affairs.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Colombian elections 
scheduled for 8 May 1994. 
  On 10 March, Conservative Party presidential candidate 
Andres 
Pastrana Arango suggested breaking off relations with Cuba again 
because Cuba supports guerrilla and dynamite attacks in 
Colombia. Pastrana emphatically said: "Colombia should not have 
ties with Cuba as long as Fidel Castro's government continues to 
support the National Liberation Army, which kills our leaders, 
as in the case of late Senate Vice President Dario Londono, 
blows up oil pipelines, and sows terror." Pastrana noted that: 
"Given the crisis Cubans are facing, it is important Fidel 
Castro shows he is willing to facilitate an opening to 
democracy. That is what Latin America expects from him." (Santa 
Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 11 Mar 94 p 17A) 
  On 11 March, Liberal Party presidential candidate Humberto 
de 
la Calle Lombana stated he has always tried to establish the 
central points of his campaign and the differences and 
similarities with other candidates' campaigns. He added that he 
has not and will never resort to personal attacks. De la Calle 
said he does not agree with the idea that the runner-up should 
automatically become the vice president because Colombia needs a 
harmonious relation between the president and vice president. De 
la Calle emphasized that: "It is not a matter of Samper or de la 
Calle, Colombia is what is really at stake." (Santa Fe de Bogota 
Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 11 Mar 94)

  [Text] Powdered Milk Import Permit Eliminated 
  The government has passed new control measures affecting a 
number of agricultural products aimed at preventing imported 
goods from hurting the market, and has deregulated foreign 
purchases of powdered milk. 
  Yesterday the Higher Foreign Trade Council voted to increase 
the duty on beans, set references prices for lentils, chickpeas, 
broad beans, and kidney beans, and maintained the import permit 
for cut-up chicken. 
  The duty on kidney beans rose from 15 to 20 percent. The 
Ministry of Agriculture explained that the measure is an attempt 
to promote crop diversification and substitution programs being 
carried out in depressed areas. 
  In the case of cotton, it was decided to adopt permanently 
the 10-percent duty that had been set on a provisional basis. 
  The reference prices set for four types of grain are an 
attempt to establish a base value aimed at helping customs 
authorities to identify cases of underbilling on imports. 
  Powdered milk imports were deregulated based on a possible 
shortfall on the domestic market. 
  The decision to maintain the restriction on cut-up chicken 
was made because it poses a continuing threat to national 
producers. 
  On the recommendation of the National Narcotics Council, it 
was also decided to include acetic anhydride and toluene on the 
list of products requiring an import permit. 
  According to the Council, these products, which are used in 
the paint industry, could be entering the country for the 
purpose of producing illicit drugs. 
  Minister of Foreign Trade Juan Manuel Santos said that one 
of 
the most important measures was the adoption of the trade 
protection system based on which the government will be able to 
impose duties or quotas on imported products that seriously 
affect local production. 
  "If the national and international situation indicates that 
there may be a serious threat to national production, protection 
of a given sector will be justified," Santos explained. 
  "This is a clause applied throughout the world and Colombia 
had simply delayed passing it," he added. 
<H5>  Tariff and Cars </H5>
  The foreign trade oversight agency also ratified the 
automotive agreement between Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. 
  According to Santos Calderon, an order will be issued next 
week setting the import duty on vehicles at 35 percent. 
  The order helps luxury automobiles, the duty on which is now 
40 percent. However, other types of vehicles will pay 35 percent. 
  For commercial vehicles such as vans (panel trucks) and 
ambulances, the duty will drop from 20 to 15 percent. 
  In addition, and as this daily newspaper announced 
yesterday, 
a system of safeguards was defined. This is a mechanism making 
it possible to establish temporary protection against an unusual 
increase in imports of a product hurting national production. 
  For agriculture and fishing, the safeguard will consist of a 
surtariff. 
  Manufactured products may also request a surtariff and, in 
extreme cases, an import quota. 
  The issue of environmental requirements governing imported 
gasoline will be taken up at the next Council meeting. 
<H5>  [Box, p 12A] </H5>
<H5>  Cattlemen Reject Imported Milk </H5>
  The Antioquia Cattlemen's Federation (FADEGAN) and Milk 
Cooperative (COLANTA) have emphatically rejected the 
deregulation of powdered milk imports, which had been required 
to have import permits since the middle of last year. 
  In a letter sent to Ministers Rudolf Hommes (Finance), Juan 
Manuel Santos (Foreign Trade), and Jose Antonio Ocampo 
(Agriculture), the Antioquia Cattlemen are asking that the 
import permit be retained. 
  FADEGAN says its position "in no way means that we defend 
excessive protectionism." 
  The cattlemen also insist that allowing powdered milk to 
enter the country is a step backward, and warn of "the harmful 
consequences which this measure will have for the rural 
producer." 
  In 1993, the livestock sector and dairy industry both 
experienced one of their worst crises ever. The difficult 
situation forced pasturizers to lower the price of milk and the 
government to institute the import permit in order to bolster 
national milk production. 
  COLANTA, an association of 9,000 milk producers in 
Antioquia, 
Cordoba, and the coffee belt, argues that foreign milk is a 
danger to Colombian industry, which has to compete with the high 
subsidies granted by wealthy nations.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] The Attorney General's Office and Ministry of 
Defense have joined forces to draft a new Military Penal Code. 
  The code will include forms of illicit conduct not 
previously 
classified as crimes or simply viewed as disciplinary problems. 
  Experts from the two institutions say that consideration is 
being given to the inclusion in the code of such crimes as 
forced disappearances, torture, and other illicit acts falling 
into the category of sexual abuse. 
  Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta has appointed two 
assistant prosecutors to work with the Ministry of Defense on 
the joint undertaking. 
  They are Mauricio Fajardo, assistant prosecutor for the 
military forces, and Manuel Corredor, first assistant prosecutor 
for criminal matters. 
  Sources within the Attorney General's Office said yesterday, 
for example, that forced disappearance is prohibited by the 
Constitution, but not classified as a crime in either the Penal 
Code or the Military Penal Code. 
  For that reason, both prosecutors argue that it must be 
included in the new code, harshly penalized, and used as a 
deterrent to law enforcement officers who might commit such 
abuses. 
  The same sources said that torture had to be classified as a 
crime because proven cases can only be penalized as personal 
injuries, when such is the case, or as abuses of authority. 
  The objective is to ensure that these and other issues are 
studied by the joint commission of the Attorney General's Office 
and Ministry of Defense, whose prosecutors would be officers 
from the criminal jurisdiction and members of the general 
inspectorships of all the Armed Forces. 
  Last week Arrieta sent a letter to General Ramon Emilio Gil, 
acting minister of defense, informing him that the Attorney 
General's Office expects a revision, not only of new crime 
classifications, but also of all matters relating to 
competencies and procedures in force under the existing Military 
Penal Code. 
  In the opinion of the attorney general, the letter says, the 
success of the revision "will not only determine the credibility 
of military criminal justice. Rather, the military institutions 
themselves would in addition reap incalculable benefits, in 
terms of the morale of their members and the trust which civil 
society has in them, from having an effective administration of 
justice that deals swiftly and rigorously with the punishable 
conduct of those who do not deserve to be in their ranks." 
<H5>  Scarcity of Attorneys </H5>
  Arrieta explained in his letter to Gil that his Office has a 
special interest in such a reform, based on a clear policy aimed 
at guaranteeing respect for human rights. 
  The Office of Attorney General believes that with respect to 
procedure, for example, the Code should fill vacuums created by 
a recent ruling of the Constitutional Court eliminating the 
possibility of naming officers who are not attorneys to defend 
the accused. 
  The Court ruling, which basically deemed [it] a violation of 
the right to an adequate defense, forced the military criminal 
jurisdiction to seek emergency solutions. 
  The courts and the Military Criminal Tribunal, for example, 
were forced to call upon attorneys from the Public Defender's 
Office and the legal offices of universities. 
  Even so, the backlog and lack of defense counsel rendered 
the 
plan practically inoperative. The Attorney General's Office 
believes that the military jurisdiction should begin by drawing 
up a complete record of performance.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Isabel </F>
Allende by Francis Van Den Berghe, in Havana; date not given: 
"Cuba: Lifting Embargo Would Open Way To Normal Relations With 
United States -- Americans `Are Using Democracy And Human Rights 
As An Excuse'"] 
  [Text] Havana -- "Of course we want normal relations with 
the United States, it was not Cuba that broke off relations," 
says Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Isabel Allende. "But first 
the 32-year-old economic embargo against our country must be 
lifted. It has cost us $40 billion in damage, goes against 
international law, and has been condemned throughout the world. 
With such an embargo, how could it be possible for us to talk 
about compensation for U.S. possessions (which were nationalized 
after the 1959 revolution, ed.)?" 
  Washington recently lifted the economic embargo against 
Vietnam without imposing political preconditions. Deputy 
Minister Allende does not have much hope that this will also 
happen to Cuba in the near future. 
  "It is a good, rational thing that the embargo against 
Vietnam was lifted," she says. "But Cuba is a special case for 
U.S. Governments. Their policy toward us goes beyond pure 
rationality. Cuba is something like an obsession. Of course, 
one can also interpret the maintenance of the embargo against 
Cuba as a warning to the rest of Latin America," a warning that 
a high price is paid for any reduction in U.S. influence on the 
continent. 
  "The Americans," Allende sighs, "make demands on us about 
human rights and democracy. But they are just excuses. They do 
not want Cuba to follow an independent course." These demands 
are largely linked to domestic U.S. politics, she says. There 
are more than 1 million Cubans living in the United States, and 
they are U.S. citizens and voters who are hostile to the Castro 
government. Wealthy exiles finance the election campaigns of 
U.S. politicians like Torricelli, who ensured that the Cuban 
embargo was further tightened at the end of 1992. 
  "Not all of them are hysterics who want to further 
strengthen 
the embargo," according to Allende. "Others do not want that at 
all. In April, we will talk with those exiles who accept that 
Cuba makes its decisions itself." The distinction between 
"fanatics" and other Cubans in the United States is a new 
element in Havana's attitude. Until recently all exiles were 
regarded as "gusanos" (worms) and defectors who had betrayed 
their country. 
  The deputy prime minister speaks passionately in support of 
the democratization carried out by Cuba within the one-party 
system. "What is democracy?" she asks. "Does it only exist in 
one form, such as the one applied in the United States? For me, 
it still means government by the people. In Cuba the 
people participate in the government. Where else are planned 
economic measures subjected to popular consultation in the 
workplace?" Allende refers to the planned government cutbacks, 
the introduction of a progressive income tax, and other 
far-reaching changes, which after an initial debate in 
parliament, are being discussed in the factories under the 
leadership of the trade unions. 
  The minister defends last year's general elections. "It was 
the people who chose the candidates for the election lists," she 
says. "Directly and by secret voting." She agrees with 
parliamentary Chairman Ricardo Alarcon. He said proudly that 
"the political map of the world would look very different if 
everywhere, like in Cuba, the people selected the candidates, 
rather than the political machines greased by the financial 
powers." 
  Havana feels that Washington, with regard to Cuba, limits 
the 
concept of "human rights" to individual and political rights, 
while discounting economic and social rights. "There are human 
rights in Cuba, which are not even discussed in other parts of 
the world," Allende says, referring to free education and health 
care and the absence of hunger and poverty. "In addition, 
Washington violates human rights itself," she says. "U.S. 
companies are not allowed to trade with us and U.S. tourists are 
not allowed to go to Cuba." 
  Nicanor Leon Cotayo, a columnist for the Trabajadores trade 
union newspaper and member of the Communist Party's Central 
Committee, also calls the U.S arguments for the embargo excuses. 
"The original justifications given for the embargo were that 
Cuba was a danger to U.S. security, that it encouraged 
subversion in Latin America, that it was the ally of the Soviet 
Union, that it intervened in Angola. With the passing of time 
they could no longer use these arguments. Now human rights and 
democracy have once again come to the forefront in their 
arguments." 
  Nicanor Leon says: "But when Washington had to explain to 
the 
United Nations why it supported the embargo, it dropped all 
these arguments and maintained only the demand for compensation 
for nationalized U.S. interests in Cuba." Only the United 
States is still making problems about the nationalization; in 
other countries the problem has been cleared up, according to 
him. And the real reason for the embargo? "The United States 
has not forgiven Cuba for shaking off its neocolonial status in 
1959 in a traditional sphere of U.S. influence." 
  Leon points out that to a large degree Cuba "is a theme of 
domestic politics in the United States. Nearly 1 million Cubans 
live in Florida, the state with the fourth biggest electorate in 
the United States. The U.S.'s Cuba policy is decided in Miami. 
Up to now it was Jorge Mas Canosa who decided this policy." 
  Mas Canosa, a businessman originally from Cuba, is 
president of the Cuban American National Foundation, a 
right-wing, extreme anti-Castro organization. He was the 
architect of the tightening of the U.S.'s embargo on Cuba during 
the 1992 presidential election campaign. "That is the core of 
the problem," says Leon. "The U.S. policy toward Cuba is 
hostage to Cubans in Miami." Leon does not say "the" Cubans in 
Miami: he, too, makes a distinction between Cuban exiles who 
want to talk to Castro and the "fanatics" around Mas Canosa. 
  How are things in Cuba now? "The lifting of the embargo 
would make it easier to solve our internal problems," says Leon, 
"simply because it would be cheaper to import a range of 
products." 
<H5>  Investments </H5>
  Deputy Minister Allende identifies two priorities: "We must 
seek new markets, and we must encourage foreign investments, for 
without these investments we cannot get production up to an 
adequate level." Cuba has rolled out the red carpet for foreign 
investors. They can have full ownership of companies and 
repatriate profits. 
  Recently Cuba has been inundated with businessmen eagerly 
looking for opportunities. Many made investments, but others 
wonder how they can repatriate profits if they cannot convert 
their money into foreign currency. Cuba is considering making 
the peso convertible, but is still hesitating because that would 
entail a large devaluation. 
  "For us,two principles cannot be negotiated," says 
Allende,"and those are our independence and sovereignty; and the 
benefits of the revolution, a social security system like that 
on which Europe prides itself. And the fundamental sectors of 
the economy will not be considered for privatization."

  [Text] Guatemala City, 15 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- The National 
Police intervened today at the Finance Ministry offices, opening 
the doors of an institution whose employees have been on strike 
since 14 March demanding a salary increase. President de Leon 
Carpio issued the order today before leaving for Mexico on a 
two-day official visit, during which he will meet with Mexican 
counterpart Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
  The National Police also plan to intervene in the next few 
hours at the courts of justice, the Supreme Court, and attorney 
offices, the employees of which have been on strike since 11 
March, demanding a 40-percent salary increase. 
  Public security agents have been posted at the main gates of 
the Finance Ministry to keep them open and to allow entry for 
people who want to pay their debts to the Treasury. 
  Last night, de Leon Carpio signed an agreement with the 
National Federation of Public Employees Unions to establish a 
monthly bonus for public employees of 110 quetzales, or the 
equivalent of $17. 
  The largest unions in the country, such as the Workers 
Unitary Organization [IUT] and the National Federation of State 
Workers Unions [Fenasteg], did not sign the agreement. IUT and 
Fenasteg proposed that the salary increase amount to 300 
quetzales, or $52, which the government rejected on the basis 
that it does not have enough funds to give public employees a 
salary increase. Public employees earn some $82 a month.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 16 Mar (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
said today that the United States "wants the patents rights bill 
to be approved but is not exerting any kind of pressure" on the 
Argentine Government. He again exhorted Congress to discuss the 
bill because "it will open the possibility for us to join NAFTA." 
  Menem recalled that Argentine officials "discussed the issue 
with the Bush administration" and that the bill has been in the 
Argentine Congress "for more than two years," so there should be 
some news about it during the current congressional period. 
  The Argentine president denied there is "concern in the 
United States" over the declaration of free zones approved last 
night by the Argentine Senate. He attributed "the pressure" on 
this subject "to the provinces, which urgently need to 
reactivate some zones within their territories." 
  Menem also mentioned the possibility of sending a new group 
of Argentine military men to the former Yugoslavia. He said: "A 
decision has yet to be made. Only conversations have been held 
for the time being." 
  Menem said: "Argentina cannot be absent, considering the 
petition by the United Nations to preserve peace in places where 
our `Blue Helmets' may be useful. We are speaking of 
professionals, officers, and non-commissioned officers, who 
voluntarily accept the call." 
  The president told a radio station that he is aware that the 
place where the confrontation between Serbs and Croats is taking 
place "is a high risk zone," but pointed out that "Argentine 
military men are prepared for a situation of this kind and do 
not go there by obligation, as it happens with other `Blue 
Helmets' from other parts of the world." 
  Regarding the Argentine proposal to create a "White Helmets" 
force to combat hunger in the world, Menem said U.N. Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali may officially present the project 
to the U.N. General Assembly. 
  Menem added that he has "spoken to practically every" 
president on this subject, "even with the pope who expressed 
great interest." 
  Regarding his decision to shorten the sentence of former 
Deputy Norberto Imbelloni -- who is serving a sentence in the 
Villa Devoto penitentiary for simple homicide -- Menem said: 
"This is normal whenever a convict shows good conduct." 
  "It is applied at a national level, including the provinces. 
It is the reduction of a sentence, not a pardon, owed to the 
good conduct and work demonstrated by the convict so that he may 
rejoin society," Menem said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Alvaro Moscoso Blanco, president of the </F>
Cochabamba Development Corporation by Carlos Heredia Guzman; 
place and date not given: "It Would Not Be Expedient To Open Up 
the Oil Royalties Fund"] 
  [Text] At a crucial moment in the appointment of capable 
officials to run the institutions for development of the region, 
and after several months of changes without warning of its 
presidents, the Cochabamba Regional Development Corporation 
(CORDECO), as of last week, has a new executive president. 
Alvaro Moscoso Blanco, highly respected nationally and 
internationally for his brilliant works and his conference 
papers presented before distinguished audiences, is now at the 
helm of CORDECO, a company that is in critical economic shape 
but that has great potentialities, especially in the rural area, 
as well as many problems to resolve. Following are the thoughts 
Alvaro Moscoso has expressed to FACETAS: 
  [Heredia] We are five months into the term of a new 
administration, and the institution that you now preside over 
has already had four presidents. In what condition have you 
found CORDECO? 
  [Moscoso] CORDECO's situation is critical. We have found a 
situation without liquidity, with accounts receivable totaling 
over 7 million bolivianos for completed projects, unpaid by the 
preceding administration. CORDECO's performance is still being 
affected by structural organizational problems. We think the 
time has come to restructure and institutionalize it. We also 
believe that the focus of CORDECO's purposes and objectives must 
be reoriented. We have also found an extremely delicate 
situation in the PIL [Indian Liberation Party], with assets 
totaling not more than 25 million bolivianos and taxes owed to 
the state totaling over 60 million bolivianos. I believe this is 
CORDECO's most delicate aspect. 
  [Heredia] The PIL is your first stumbling block. Where is it 
to get the money to pay the taxes it owes to the state, knowing 
that the PIL is an institution that must subsidize your products 
for Bolivia's infant population? 
  [Moscoso] At this time there is no visible solution, because 
of the extent of the possible applicability of the SAFCO 
[Administrative and Financial System for Government Control] 
Law. The debts owed by the state to the state must be covered, 
especially when all the steps in this process have been 
followed. What we are awaiting now is a possible reply by the 
president of the Republic to overcome this worrisome problem for 
all the citizens of Cochabamba. Even a payment plan that the 
Directorate of Internal Revenue might offer the PIL and the 
corporation would place a strain on this company's capabilities. 
  [Heredia] What are the first tasks you have set out to 
accomplish within CORDECO? 
  [Moscoso] There are two spheres of action. CORDECO's 
internal 
sphere needs to be restructured immediately, and its hierarchy 
institutionalized. The restructuring will be addressed by the 
Social Participation Law, whereas the institutionalization will 
be defined by our administration. We think the 
institutionalization will enable us to establish a hierarchy of 
public-sector employees and set standards and required 
qualifications for service to the collectivity. We believe 
CORDECO must be depoliticized so as to turn it into a technical 
instrument for development oriented toward improving the 
well-being of the citizenry. The second sphere of action 
concerns the corporation's responses to the major problems 
facing the department. These problems can be boiled down to the 
structure of the tenancy of the land in the inter-Andean 
valleys, which is marked by a small-holder economy that first 
makes its appearance in the tropic of Cochabamba; the migration 
toward urban centers, which is acquiring alarming dimensions; 
the scant dynamism of industry from the standpoint of generating 
employment for these people; and the overall inability to 
generate employment and services for the citizenry in general. 
  [Heredia] You speak of institutionalizing the hierarchy of 
functions in CORDECO. When is this going to begin? 
  [Moscoso] It will begin once the Social Participation Law, 
which I understand is tied to the tasks of corporations, is 
passed. It will certainly modify the way in which those tasks 
are carried out. When this phase of structural reforms to be 
enforced by the central government is enacted, we shall enter 
the institutionalization phase. 
  [Heredia] Toward which sector will your work mainly be 
directed under the new approach that your presidency is 
proposing? 
  [Moscoso] CORDECO must be de-urbanized. Cochabamba poses 
major problems, but at the same time, it offers vast 
potentialities from the standpoint of natural resources. We 
believe we must start working in the provinces, and more 
specifically in the rural area, gearing the work of the 
corporation to the activities of the social organizations in the 
rural area. In some provinces, as in the case of Mizque, 
Provincial Development Councils have been created that 
successfully integrate governmental authorities with 
representative organizations of civil society. This linkage has 
introduced a new development dynamic that is notable in the 
Mizque zone. 
  [Heredia] Two important and perhaps controversial points: 
oil 
royalties and relations with the mayoralty. 
  [Moscoso] The oil royalties budgeted this year total 21.53 
million bolivianos. My first step upon arriving at the 
corporation was to request a report on the revenue the 
corporation has received as royalties, and I ordered the opening 
of a specific account for the administration of these funds. I 
believe the corporation and its management must administer the 
royalties rigorously and responsibly, drawing on the experiences 
of record in other departments. We think royalties must be 
managed in accordance with the law of 14 September 1992 devoting 
them principally to the implementation of the Misicuni Project. 
Meanwhile, it seems to me that it would not be expedient to open 
up the royalties fund for grabs by all the institutions. There 
is a request from the Cochabamba mayoralty, a prior one from the 
university, the Quillacollo mayoralty has spoken of its 
intention in this respect, as have also the inhabitants of 
Carrasco Province. It seems to me very dangerous to accede to 
these requests without the prior benefit of a specific policy 
regulating the administration of oil royalties. This does not 
mean in any way that we do not wish to work or cooperate with 
the mayoralty. On the contrary, I wish to make it clear publicly 
that I fully intend to cooperate with Cochabamba's municipality 
and with all the municipalities of the Department of Cochabamba. 
It is my obligation and we are prepared to finance funding for 
the municipal mayoralty, to endorse projects for their 
respective financing. 
  [Heredia] There would seem to be a degree of zeal in 
relation 
to the administering of the oil royalties. 
  [Moscoso] The royalties are, beyond question, the 
corporation's operating revenues. This is laid down in law, and 
it is the corporation management's responsibility, in 
coordination with the department's parliamentary work group, to 
decide the use and destination of these funds. The corporation 
is prepared to cooperate in this regard, but it seems to me very 
premature to institute a future earmarking of some 20 percent of 
the royalties. This could give rise to a subjugation of the 
administration of these funds on the basis of very justified 
demands, not only on the part of the mayoralty.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Subcommander Marcos of the EZLN by </F>
David Aponte and Matilde Perez U. in Chiapas; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] Lacandona Jungle, Chiapas State, 15 Mar -- 
Subcommander Marcos, of the Zapatist National Liberation Army 
[EZLN], has reported that his organization will not initiate any 
warlike action and will stop all "warlike advancements" 
regardless of the results of the discussions for an honorable 
peace. 
  He categorically stated that the EZLN will not unilaterally 
open fire in spite of provocations against the peace process by 
farm owners and ranchers in Chiapas. He noted: "If the farm 
owners do not take a military initiative against us, we will not 
take one against them because the Indian Revolutionary 
Clandestine Committee decided on its own to respect the August 
elections process." 
  Marcos explained: "At this moment political work is above 
military actions, and our watchword to the communities of the 
region and to all the country is: `Here we are! This is our 
call now.'" 
  Marcos was interviewed in a rebel military operations 
center. 
The subcommander spoke about his military strategies and 
tactics, the social support his movement enjoys in the 
communities, and governing the rebel-controlled zones for the 
past two years. [passage omitted] 
  [LA JORNADA] Is the EZLN surrounded by the federal Army in 
the jungle? 
  [Marcos] In a military sense, yes, our forces are 
surrounded. 
We cannot make any offensive movement or muster big or small 
units of troops or try an offensive like the 1 January one. But 
we maintain a defensive position, and we are in our territory. 
We are trained for this. When we withdrew after the attacks on 
the municipalities, we adopted this position. 
  [LA JORNADA] Has this cease-fire period represented a 
military advantage for the Mexican Army? Have they located you? 
Were you prepared for this phase? 
  [Marcos] We are. When the cease-fire came on 12 January the 
federal Army said to itself: "I have located them. I have their 
barracks and their communications centers, and I am ready to 
bomb them," and it did. They bombed several of our positions 
even after the cease-fire order had been given and later argued 
that the troops did not know about the cease-fire. What 
happened is that the Army already had complete military 
intelligence reports and then planned to definitely push us out 
of the towns into the mountains and then engage in a 
counterinsurgency phase, but now without the media being on top 
of the Army. 
  Then the federal Army realized that the Zapatist positions 
were, geographically speaking, in the center of rural towns. 
The Army then decided, within the framework of the fabrication 
that came out of the Persian Gulf war that it is possible to 
wage war against a nation and to kill only the military without 
harming the civilian population, that a surgical-type 
annihilation would be easy. I imagine that the political cost of 
this was estimated. 
  The government and the Army were bewildered. They wondered 
who is really behind this movement. They looked at each other 
out of the corners of their eyes wondering if the person at 
their side could be the one sponsoring it. Then they decided to 
go for the cease-fire and for the dialogue, to see who is behind 
all this. 
  [LA JORNADA] What is the difference between the EZLN and 
other guerrilla movements, such as those in Central America? 
The EZLN seized some municipalities and then withdrew. 
  [Marcos] Yes, because our force is made up of peasants. We 
have no forces in the cities. Of course the peasants can 
control the cities and the roads militarily. They do not have 
to attack cities to control them. The peasants may attack a 
city to recover weapons, ammunition, or to do propaganda work. 
  We began our struggle with political work and with the 
formation of militias in the towns for the self defense of 
territories, but we do not have the capability to carry out 
urban military actions. The truth is that those urban military 
actions that took place during the armed conflict were the work 
of other organizations. We had nothing to do with that. 
  The current EZLN stage is one of survival, and we have to 
see 
that no life is lost, in the best of cases, and that this allows 
us to keep our territory to survive as a combatant force. 
  Another objective is to receive the support of the people, 
who have told us: "Do not surrender the weapons." First they 
used to say: "Talk, make peace." Later they said: "Talk, but do 
not believe in what the government says; do not surrender the 
weapons because if they are going to give us something it is 
because we are armed; if you put down your weapons, they will 
give us nothing." We received this kind of advice from many 
people. 
  [LA JORNADA] The interview was interrupted by a combatant 
who 
brought a message. Marcos concluded the interview with an 
anecdote from General Francisco Villa. 
  [Marcos] His people used to ask him where he was going to 
sleep, and he always named a place, but the next morning he 
would wake up in a different site. He was afraid of being 
betrayed."

<F P=106> [Report by Roxana Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Jesus Sierra, the legal adviser to the Legislative 
Assembly Drug Committee, has reported that the DEA operation to 
uncover an alleged Panama-based drug trafficking and money 
laundering organization was geared to finding and seizing 
foreign exchange offices, credit companies, stock market 
operations, and [legal] offices that formed private companies in 
our country through letters of credit. 
  After gathering information on the alleged participation of 
Panamanian citizens in this criminal case, the legal adviser 
reported to the legislators on the Drug Committee and said no 
government official is involved in this case up to now. Jesus 
Sierra said the investigation, which according to U.S. federal 
agencies began more than two years ago, has not concluded and 
added that no Panamanian Government official appears to be 
involved in the case under investigation. 
  He emphasized that the DEA operation, which discovered the 
drug trafficking and money laundering organization in Panama, 
worked to find and seize foreign exchange offices, credit 
companies, stock market operators, and [legal] offices that 
formed private companies in our country through letters of 
credit to find out if they were involved in criminal activities. 
  Sierra said the DEA has a solid and strong case and has not 
yet concluded its investigation. Thus, he said, we will have to 
wait until the investigation ends to determine whether 
government officials have participated in those illegal 
activities. 
  Concluding, the official reported that he is preparing a 
file 
on this notorious case containing all the information he 
gathered during his trip to Tampa, Florida. 
  Jesus Sierra also gave information on Legislator Anel 
Ramirez, who is held in a Tampa jail on alleged drug trafficking 
charges. He said Ramirez had changed lawyers and appointed 
Richard Everst as his legal representative in the trial against 
him which will start in April.

  [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso received 
the IMF's support today in Washington for his economic 
stabilization program. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Paulo Henrique Amorim] 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso came to Washington to begin 
negotiations with the IMF on a loan for Brazil. After a long 
lunch, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus read a communique 
praising the Brazilian economic program, the conclusion of an 
agreement with banks, the fiscal adjustment cutting government 
spending, the privatization program, the strong Brazilian 
position on the balance of payments, and the liberalization of 
trade. The communique says the IMF promised to work closely with 
Brazil to defeat inflation. The implementation of the new 
currency, the real, could coincide with a loan for Brazil. I 
asked the IMF managing director if a loan would only be granted 
with the implementation of the real. He replied that the new 
monetary unit could be a powerful anchor and an important 
instrument for a possible loan. He said Brazil has to face the 
key issue of hyperinflation. Does this mean, minister, that it 
will first be necessary to create the real to get the IMF loan? 
  [Cardoso] No, it means that the IMF already considers the 
plan positive. We do not need an IMF loan; what we need is that 
positive signal to conclude negotiations with the banks. 
  [Amorim] Do you interpret this communique as support for 
your 
economic policy? 
  [Cardoso] It was expressed in that sense. He clearly said 
that the Brazilian Government's policy has his support. He saw 
the seriousness of our program. Camdessus went even further than 
that; he personally conveyed his support to me and I am 
conveying it to the president of the Republic. [end recording] 
  The economic team is concerned about the finance minister's 
political future. We have a live report by Alexandre Garcia from 
Brasilia: 
  [Garcia] The minister left Brasilia saying he is tied up 
with 
the Finance Ministry because of the economic plan. He really 
wants to make quite clear that despite the insistence of 
political leaders to become a presidential candidate, the 
economic plan should not be mixed with electoral goals. But 
today the Finance Ministry economic team said the plan's most 
difficult part already has been done, that the team alone can 
continue implementing the program in the ministry. The team said 
the minister can be more useful as a senator by returning to 
Congress to help in the constitutional reform, to do the other 
part of the plan to eliminate the structural causes of 
inflation, such as the excessive size of the state, that affect 
the people's pocketbooks. The economic team believes the 
minister, since the plan is a long-range plan, should begin to 
think about next year, and this is why the economic team wants 
the minister to become a presidential candidate, to guarantee 
the conclusion of the plan. Because if government guidelines are 
changed next January, the plan will fade away.

had promised to do so complied with their promises, (?except) 
for the U.S. Government. It is their decision, and we respect 
it. Any money we can get is welcome, but if someone promises to 
give money and now does not want to give it... [end recording]

  [Text] Prior to 1988, the man who today has "cocaine 
falling like rain" on northern Valle del Cauca was simply an 
active police officer with no rank. 
  [Victor Julio Fomeque] Patino, who was subsequently assigned 
to the Secret Police Division in Buenaventura from the F-2's 
[Judicial Police and Criminal Statistics Office] official 
garrison, began to promote a private justice squad. With the 
help of a police officer named Benavides, his brothers, and 
other police officers, Patino -- against whom an arrest warrant 
has been issued by faceless prosecutors from Cali -- became a 
member of the group that operated in Buenaventura under the name 
"Thief Killers" [Los Mata Ladrones]. 
  Although his leadership in the "Thief Killers" gave him some 
clout, a different episode began his drug trafficking career. 
  Promoted to personal bodyguard of Captain Beltran in the 
Police Intelligence Service, Patino finally had the opportunity 
to truly demonstrate his power and courage. 
  Patino saved the life of Capt. Beltran by helping him to 
escape unharmed from an attack. The compensation was not long 
in coming. Capt. Beltran, connected to an important Cali drug 
trafficker, offered Patino the opportunity to send small amounts 
of cocaine "pinned" [apuntados] to shipments in which the 
captain participated. 
  This situation continued for some time until Beltran decided 
Patino was ready to meet their mutual benefactor, a drug 
trafficker whom the DEA has been trailing for years and who has 
always been one of the top five men in the Valle del Cauca drug 
trafficking organization. 
  The contact allowed Patino to advance from meager amounts of 
cocaine to up to 2 to 3 kg on the northern Valle del Cauca 
traffickers' route to Miami (Florida). 
  Patino's prosperous career, however, served to separate him 
from his former allies the "Thief Killers." 
  The new business among Patino, the police official, and the 
drug traffickers ended with Benavides' transfer to Bogota and 
his subsequent death a few months later. 
  A few weeks later, Patino resigned from the force and began 
to advance in the organization until he became an associate of 
two other powerful drug traffickers. The three began to ship 
cocaine on their own account. 
  Their ambition, however, exasperated the Cali Cartel's top 
brass, which held a meeting and decided to geographically divide 
northern Valle del Cauca Department among themselves and to 
assign routes, markets, and responsibilities. 
  One group was given the center of the department, and the 
other was assigned northern Valle del Cauca, Tulua, Salonica, 
Canon de Las Garrapatas (limits between Valle del Cauca and 
Choco Departments) and southern Risaralda Department. Still 
others assumed direct control over finances and the main 
contacts abroad. 
  Patino apparently was under the direct command of two chiefs 
of the northern Valle del Cauca cartels. He could no longer 
ship cocaine on his own behalf, but he was given control over 
and participation in all reception and shipment operations. 
This included several shipments of heroin made last year from 
the Buenaventura and Choco coasts. 
  There in the bowels of the cartel, Patino assumed the alias 
"El Quimico" or "El Papi," and in a short time he substantially 
reduced the cartels' dependency on Bolivian and Peruvian cocaine 
paste. 
  In turn, he promoted the expansion of plantations in various 
parts of Colombia and established an important coca paste 
processing laboratory in Tapon del Darien [Panama]. The 
laboratory was only a 25-minute flight from the border with 
Panama and an exactly one hour flight from Cali. 
  Two additional processing centers with the capacity to 
refine 
500 kg of cocaine were installed near the border between Valle 
del Cauca and Choco on the banks of a stream that flows into the 
Cauca River in Saija district. 
  The possibility of turning Choco into a center for drug 
trafficking prompted Patino to illegally hire a Peruvian 
engineer to draw topographic maps of the area. At the end of 
last year, Patino was waiting for a man known in Cali as "Zapato 
Blanco" to provide him with false but quite realistic 
identification documents to conceal the Peruvian's nationality 
and thereby allow the man to be linked to a front company. 
  At the same time, Patino was putting the finishing touches 
on 
the process to introduce psychotropic and chemical substances 
through Buenaventura, Barranquilla, and the Ecuadoran border. 
  Patino's current prominence in the business is only partly 
due to his ability to supervise the shipping and receiving of 
cocaine. Patino also coordinates an impressive organization that 
includes a 34-ship fleet, a complex network of informers, hired 
killers, money launderers, cocaine trafficking contacts abroad, 
and several hundred business fronts. 
  The maritime flotilla comprises four boats; six pleasure 
yachts with diesel motors; two cargo vessels for transporting 
supplies and merchandise; and seven fishing boats with a 7-meter 
draft, 11-knot speed, VHF and UHF communications systems, and 
72-mile radars. There are also shrimp boats and tuna fishing 
boats up to 1,200 tons each. 
  Although most of the yachts, boats, and small draft vessels 
currently appear in the name of individuals or of a Colombian 
consortium, the Valle del Cauca traffickers have been able to 
hide larger draft ships registered under Honduran, Mexican, and 
Ecuadoran flags. There is even one registered under a South 
Korean flag. 
  Patino is also an organizer of sophisticated and complex 
cocaine and weapons caches. Between August and September 1992, 
Patino arranged for the construction of a multilevel building in 
Valle with caches between the floors. Television cameras and 
sophisticated Super Bland alarm systems were hidden between the 
first and second floors, and false access doors constructed of 
steel and concrete reinforcements and operated by remote control 
were installed in the building. 
  The Prosecutor's Office, the police, and the Armed Forces 
intelligence services had access to information on Patino and 
other drug traffickers' activities. 
  The Prosecutors' Office had access to two witnesses, and the 
Armed Forces, within the framework of a weapons-trafficking 
investigation, had access to informers' statements. 
  Nevertheless, it was not until August 1993 that the 
Prosecutor's Office and the intelligence services turned their 
attention to the man whom they point out as the chief of the 
drug business in the northern part of Valle del Cauca. 
  A hired killer shot four times Captain Juan Carlos Alvarez, 
Armed Forces intelligence, from behind on 6 August 1993. 
Alvarez had been assigned to the Armed Forces intelligence 
network in Buenaventura; he was subsequently transferred to the 
petroleum port of Barrancabermeja and finally to Cartagena. 
  Although Captain Juan Carlos Alvarez had obtained in 
Buenaventura valuable information on the structure of the 
organizations in northern Valle del Cauca, it was in Cartagena 
where he saw the opportunity to bring these before the law. 
  A former motorcyclist, Victor Patino came to Alvarez' office 
in Cartagena one morning at the end of June and confirmed part 
of the information he had. 
  Realizing the information he had lacked value, Alvarez 
contacted the intelligence network in the Pacific. The idea was 
to coordinate presentation of the witness before the District 
Attorney's Office; this was done. 
  Nevertheless, the Armed Forces and the District Attorney's 
Office, believing they had a witness who had charges against 
Patino, received a bitter surprise. After making his 
deposition, the witness vanished. 
  The Armed Forces' investigation initiated in the first week 
of July led to another witness who disclosed how the missing 
witness was now back in the organization, reprimanded by Patino. 
  Subsequently, Alvarez was murdered on 6 August. At this time 
the authorities decided to establish one by one Patino's 
connections and those of his organization. 
  Thus, the state's intelligence services had identified in 
December 1993 five cocaine production and processing leaders; 
eight coordinators in the shipping of drugs via wood, frozen 
chicken, fuel tanks, fruits, fish, and other exports; and seven 
organization contacts in Caracas, Panama City, and New York, as 
well as 22 members of the organization's network of security and 
hired killers. 
  The Armed Forces' informers have attributed to this last 
group--which is comprised of former military institutions' 
noncommissioned officers and retired officials, police agents, 
former M-19 [19 April Movement] guerrillas, and even a former 
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement terrorist--the murder of two 
of the organizations' links named Duran and Alzate. 
  Duran and Alzate, who were charged with transporting a 
cocaine shipment to a landing strip near Tulua, had decided to 
sell the drugs and say the police had seized the merchandise. 
  Two hired killers named Riascos and Jairo tended this 
account. The bodies of Alzate and Duran--with a shot in the nape 
and their stomachs slit and weighted with stones to prevent the 
bodies from floating--were thrown in the Cauca River, on the 
right bank at the entrance of Yotoco. 
  The drug purchaser, a trafficker named Perez who had been an 
Ochoas agent, was also sentenced to death; nevertheless, given 
his past, his death was less harsh. 
  "Arandela" [not further identified] and a man named Ordonez 
surprised Perez at an establishment en route to the sea. They 
started an argument and then killed him. 
  According to judicial sources the identification of the 
organization administered by Patino is only the tip of the 
iceberg of the drug traffickers' business in Valle del Cauca. 
  Patino's network consists of retired policemen, gunmen, and 
former M-19 guerrillas who were contacted by "El Quimico" after 
that guerrilla group's demobilization. 
  "NN Duran:" Peruvian, former member of the Tupamaros [Tupac 
Amaru Revolutionary Movement] Group, expert in handling 
explosives, responsible for an attack against a DEA agent in

<H5>  Navy: "This Is A Setup" </H5>
  Navy Lieutenant Colonel Rodrigo Quinonez, accused, along 
with 
three other officers, of organizing a network to murder 100 
people including leftist and civilian leaders in 
Barrancabermeja, testified at the 109th Criminal Military Court 
last Wednesday. 
  The officer had requested days before that he be allowed to 
testify so as to clarify the reported incident. 
  As did Quinonez, Majors Jairo Osorio and Rafael Colon and 
Lieutenant Mauricio Varon had already testified. In addition, 
the offers have testified before investigators of the Prosecutor 
General's Office and the Attorney General's Office. 
  Even though the defense's arguments have been kept secret so 
far, EL TIEMPO has consulted with different judicial sources and 
has learned the officers have answered each of the accusations 
against them. They said this is a setup prepared by an 
organization of Valle del Cauca drug traffickers. 
  Former Navy Noncommissioned Officers Carlos Lopez Maquilon 
and Saulo Segura Palacios, for whom two arrest warrants have 
been issued, filed criminal charges against the colonel, the two 
majors, and the lieutenant at the end of last year. 
  The former noncommissioned officers said they had evidence 
Quinonez and the other officers directed a network of hired 
assassins that murdered at least 100 people in Barrancabermeja. 
  To confirm their reports, the former noncommissioned 
officers 
presented recordings of coded conversations between Navy 
intelligence officers. 
  EL TIEMPO has learned the officers told the Prosecutor 
General's Office, military criminal justice, and the Attorney 
General's Office that only drug-trafficking groups were capable 
of intercepting communications between high-ranking Navy 
officers and manipulating the tapes. 
  The contents of the recordings, the officers stated, did not 
mention illegal activities, rather, investigation activities 
conducted in the Pacific area. 
  In their statements and interrogations before regular and 
criminal military justice, the officers said the Navy launched 
intelligence plans in 1991 to control the entry of weapons 
through the Pacific and managed to discover several networks of 
drug traffickers. 
<H5>  The Investigation </H5>
  Members of the Pacific intelligence network led by Captain 
Juan Carlos Alvarez have discovered these weapons traffickers 
supply the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] and ELN 
[Army of National Liberation] guerrilla groups, as well as 
drug-trafficking organizations. 
  Transferred from the Pacific to the Cartagena intelligence 
network, Alvarez contacted a man who claimed to have information 
on the Norte del Valle Cartel. 
  In exchange for a reward, this informer went to the Valle 
Regional Prosecutor's Office and spent four hours testifying 
against the leader of the drug-trafficking ring in Valle. The 
next day, when he should have continued his testimony, however, 
the witness disappeared. The witness had testified against 
Victor Julio Patino Fomeque. Members of the intelligence 
networks and the Regional Prosecutor's Office began the 
unsuccessful search for the witness. 
  Meanwhile in Cartagena, two hired assassins killed Captain 
Alvarez on 6 August--the day of his birthday. It was then an 
order for a complete inquiry came from the Intelligence 
Directorate in Bogota to help the Prosecutor's Office find 
Alvarez' killers. 
  The authorities' inquiries led ultimately to another Navy 
informer who affirmed he saw the missing witness inside a car 
that belonged to Victor Patino and that Patino was accompanying 
him. This second informer added he had proof this man had 
returned to the cartel. 
  Meanwhile, a Prosecutor's Office secret witness came to 
Barranquilla and identified the alleged hired assassin who had 
apparently been paid by the drug traffickers. The Regional 
Prosecutor's Office issued a warrant a few weeks later for 
Patino's arrest based on statements by one of his bodyguards. 
  EL TIEMPO has established several witnesses have stated at 
the Prosecutor's Office Lopez Maquilon and Segura Palacios (the 
plaintiffs) were offered money to testify against the Navy's 
intelligence officers and participate in illicit actions. 
  "NCO Carlos Lopez Maquilon," one of the witnesses, "on 
several occasions prodded me to engage in dirty deals (...) for 
money so we could get rich." Another witness, in turn, said "in 
mid-February 1993, Carlos Lopez came to Magangue as the person 
in charge of the network and asked me to leave this work, 
because he had some mafioso keeping an eye on me." 
  The same witness testified Lopez "asked me to go to the 
Prosecutor's Office to accuse the intelligence director (...) 
that he would take care of counseling me, and that I would make 
good money with the Prosecutor's Office. Finally, he told met 
if I did not accept it would be better if I left the 
institution, because he would kill me along with his people." 
  The two witnesses told the investigators the drug 
traffickers 
had deceived the NCOs, telling them if they declared themselves 
guilty the Prosecutor's Office would pardon them and give them a 
huge reward. According to witnesses, the people who hired the 
NCOs also told them that, given they had left the institution 
(Lopez asked to be discharged when he filed the complaint), the 
Prosecutor's Office could not investigate them, because they 
were not servicemen but civilians, and the Attorney General's 
Office has no jurisdiction over them.

  [Text] Manaus (Brazil), 14 Mar (EFE) -- The Manaus Federal 
Police Superintendency reported today that the armed forces of 
Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Peru have been invited by 
Brazil to join a large operation to block the drug trafficking 
mafia operating in the Amazon River basin. 
  Superintendent Mauro Sposito said the plan was presented to 
those countries during the Sixth Military Exchange Meeting of 
the Armed Forces held in Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira last week. 
  Sposito said Venezuela already has confirmed its 
participation in the campaign that will be named the "Blocking 
Operation" [Operacion Bloqueo] and Colombia hinted that it also 
will support it. 
  The Manaus (capital of Amazonas State) police superintendent 
explained that the plan includes the establishment of an 
information network among the armed forces of the countries 
sharing the Amazon basin. 
  Sposito added that in Brazil the operation will cover all 
the 
federal organizations in Amazonas State and the national and 
multinational fuel distribution companies. Sposito said 200 
Federal Police officers will work exclusively on the operation. 
  Sposito also indicated that the "Blocking Operation" has the 
basic purpose of fighting drug trafficking at the Brazilian 
border with the other four countries. 
  Brazil also intends to be excluded from the list of 
countries 
used as transit routes by international drug traffickers. 
Sposito pointed out that Brazil and Venezuela have become the 
first countries on the cocaine route that starts in Colombia and 
ends in the United States and Europe. 
  Therefore, said Sposito, the Colombian Armed Forces' 
participation will be essential for the operation's success. 
  The "Blocking Operation" seeks to intercept the flow of 
cocaine on the Amazon River by integrating the Brazilian river 
police patrols in Tabatinga (at the Colombian border) with the 
Manaus police. 
  The operation also includes a follow-up by Brazil on actions 
against drug traffickers in Colombia. 
  Strict air traffic control in the Amazon region that 
includes 
the destruction of fuel supply networks and clandestine 
airfields, as well as the neutralization of the air space in the 
large Amazon basin, are the main aspects of the "Blocking 
Operation." 
  The operation also will include two radio centers, which 
began operating last November, in Tabatinga and Tefe (Amazonas 
State) to intercept the drug trafficking routes.

  [Excerpts] Mar del Plata -- "The average age of people who 
start consuming drugs is 11," President Carlos Menem said in 
inaugurating the 15th regular session of the Inter-American 
Committee for the Control of Drugs and Drug Abuse (Cicad), an 
organization subordinate to the OAS. 
  The president said security organizations' and armed forces' 
operations to neutralize drug trafficking have not been 
effective and advocated more emphasis on legislation better 
adapted to reality and on education. 
  Accompanying Menem were Cicad President Monica Nagel, also 
Costa Rica's justice vice minister; Cicad executive secretary 
Irving Tragen from the United States; and General Pueyrredon 
Mayor Mario Russak. [passage omitted] 
  Menem said in his message that "security organizations and 
the armed forces have tried to neutralize the scourge of drug 
trafficking, adding, however, that the results have not been 
very encouraging. Each year drug traffickers have more money. It 
is known that drug traffickers move more than $6 billion per 
year, which is more than the budget of many states." 
  The president then talked about the need for common 
legislation on the matter in all countries in order to become 
more efficient. He also mentioned the proposal of those who 
think of legalizing consumption and those who propose the 
destruction of cultivated areas. The president said: "However, 
we must attack the problem at the roots. The problem is one of 
education." 
  The president mentioned that "the average age of people who 
start consuming drugs is 11," adding that since the beginning of 
his administration the number of beds for treating drug addicts 
has increased from 85 to 3,000. 
  The Cicad meeting, which is being attended by 
representatives 
from 24 American countries, will continue until 11 March.

  [Text] The Mercosur [Common Market of the South] 
negotiations continue being carried out at full speed. 
  The foreign and economy ministers from the four member 
countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) today will 
analyze the Brazilian proposal to create a South American Free 
Trade Area (ALCSA), some of whose points were anticipated by 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim in February in 
Montevideo during the eighth meeting of the ALADI [Latin 
American Integration Association] Council of Ministers. 
  The Brazilian proposal aims at liberating up to 80 percent 
of 
the trade in goods and services in South America during maximum 
10-year period, between 1995 and 2005, as well as the 
progressive, linear, and automatic lifting of trade tariffs to 
practically include the entire regional market. 
  According to diplomatic sources, the idea not only is to 
reinforce the hemispheric position of South America but also to 
reinforce regional agreements like Mercosur, ALADI, and the 
Andean Group. 
  A totally reliable government source told LA NACION: "This 
is something to which Amorim referred to once. In case it is 
approved, ALCSA should not hinder the other agreements like the 
Group of Three, made up of Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela, or 
the free trade agreement between Chile and Mexico." 
  It has not been ruled out that the possibility of Mercosur 
joining NAFTA might be discussed during the brief consultation 
meeting among the Mercosur ministers. This was mentioned by 
Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo during his tour of Germany and 
on other occasions by President Carlos Menem and Foreign 
Minister Guido Di Tella. 
  For the time being, expectations are centered on 1 July, 
when 
U.S. President Bill Clinton will send Congress a list of 
countries he believes could join NAFTA. 
  It is known that the negotiation agenda for the four 
Mercosur 
members will be strictly respected. 
  Negotiations on a Common External Tariff [Arancel Externo 
Comun -- AEC] remain on the agenda: 30 June was agreed on as 
the deadline to reach an agreement. 
  A meeting during which important progress was made on the 
chapter on chemicals was held recently. More than 80 percent of 
the tariff positions were defined during the meeting. 
  The Common Market Group will meet in Buenos Aires during the 
first days of April, and the Mercosur Council will meet on 9 
July, possibly in Mar del Plata, with the presence of Presidents 
Menem, Wasmosy, Lacalle, and Franco.

<F P=106> [Article by Daniel Santoro; copyright CLARIN] </F>
  [Text] The United States has reiterated its "subtle" 
request that the Argentine Government make antinarcotics action 
"more efficient" by opening two battle fronts. On the one hand, 
Washington wants more legal weaponry to be given to judges and 
to the police "this year," incorporating -- for example -- the 
case of "repented" persons in Argentine law, in reducing the 
penalty of detainees who provide information on drug trafficking. 
  The U.S. Administration also pointed to the need for the 
military to provide logistical support (without engaging in 
combat with drug traffickers) to security forces. Foreign 
diplomatic sources, however, have told CLARIN that the powerful 
DEA (the U.S. antinarcotics agency) believes that "for the time 
being" this step is not necessary. 
  These precise and clear signals of what Washington wants 
were 
conveyed by DEA head Robert Gelbard [title as published] to 
officials at the Foreign Ministry, the Interior Ministry, and 
the Antinarcotics Secretariat during his stay in Buenos Aires 
last week. 
  The sole reference to the Argentine military becoming 
indirectly engaged in the fight prompted a debate within the 
government, causing its anticipated rejection by the military. 
  However, according to the same sources -- who preferred to 
remain anonymous -- the DEA has another priority that comes 
before this one: incorporating, among others, the following 
provisions in the antinarcotics legislation: 
  Informers: Depenalize the actions of persons who, while not 
being criminals, provide information about drug traffickers. 
  The repented: Judges should be allowed to reduce penalties 
in return for information. This case is regulated by law in 
other countries. In Spain, for example, it was applied to the 
case of "repented" Andy Cruz Iglesias, who reported to Spanish 
judges the Argentine connection of an international 
dollar-laundering gang, which originated the so-called Yoma 
affair in Argentina. 
  Undercover agents: Policemen should be allowed to infiltrate 
traffickers' organizations, under judicial branch control. 
  Judicial branch controlled shipping: International 
drug-trafficking operations should be allowed to continue in 
order to arrest the gang in the receiving country. 
  The objective of these measures, which are added to the 
reiterated claim for increasing control over the "laundering" of 
narco-dollars, is to prevent the crimes linked with drug 
trafficking and to try to catch the heads of the organizations. 
  DEA priorities for Argentina are consistent with the U.S. 
concern about the releasing of Colombian John Arrayave Arias, 
one of the men involved in the "Prawn Operation." 
  However, and despite the fact that Secretary for the 
Prevention of Drug Abuse Alberto Lestelle has submitted a bill 
with several of these measures, Peronist deputies and senators 
are not too enthusiastic about "adjusting" the legislation in 
this regard. Opposition sources in Congress maintain that the 
first two provisions in particular will, in addition to 
contributing to fighting drugs, facilitate investigations into 
reports on corruption. 
  During a stay in Buenos Aires on his way back to Washington, 
Gelbard was seen in Recoleta on Friday, in an informal lunch 
with Foreign Ministry Secretary General Andres Cisneros. 
  The statements by the U.S. principal deputy assistant 
secretary of state for inter-American affairs, Michael Skol, 
that the Latin American military should engage in logistical 
support actions in the antinarcotics fight has revealed that the 
Foreign Ministry and the Defense Ministry disagree on this 
controversial proposal. (Skol proposed that the Armed Forces 
cooperate in intelligence, transportation, logistics, and river, 
coast, and airspace control activities). 
  "The Armed Forces should not have any type of engagement 
whatsoever, because antinarcotics action is a police task," said 
a high-ranking Defense Ministry source consulted by CLARIN. 
This opinion is shared by the Radical Civic Union. 
  Before adopting that position, Defense Minister Oscar 
Camilion consulted with the four chiefs of staff about the 
proposal. According to military sources, the answer was 
unanimous: It is not a central or a secondary mission of the 
Armed Forces. 
  However, considering that drug trafficking is a growing 
problem, Camilion is advocating the idea of "giving more 
infrastructure" to the Border Police, to the National 
Prefecture, and to the Police, instead of engaging the Argentine 
military in the fight against this scourge. 
  Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, however, adopted a 
legalistic position: Argentina "has already fulfilled" the 
request by Skol by including in the National Defense Law a 
provision under the terms of which the Armed Forces will be 
allowed to intervene in the hypothetical cases in which drug 
traffickers overwhelm security forces, high-ranking Foreign 
Ministry sources told CLARIN.

Santiago, Chile; copyright CLARIN] 
  [Text] U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor did not beat 
around the bush: yesterday he told President Carlos Menem that 
if no progress is made in Congress on the pharmaceuticals bill 
before 30 April, Argentina would be removed from the list of 
candidates for joining NAFTA. Menem and the diplomats 
accompanying him reportedly asked for a "concrete gesture" for 
joining that market as a necessary element for unblocking this 
issue, over which the U.S. laboratories are especially 
concerned. This happened in Chile yesterday, during President 
Eduardo Frei's inauguration. 
  Kantor always uses the expression "Clinton told me that..." 
to keep up appearances and bridge the gap in ranks. As a matter 
of fact U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor -- who for all 
practical purposes is the U.S. foreign trade secretary -- 
yesterday directly increased his government's pressures on 
Carlos Menem for Argentina to make progress in promulgating a 
pharmaceuticals bill before 30 April. Kantor cautioned that the 
possibility that our country might join NAFTA depends on this 
promulgation. He also cautioned about the risk that our country 
might be included in the list of nations that -- for Washington 
-- deserve economic sanctions. 
  It seems that the Argentine rejoinder was: "Our integration 
into NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement, which so 
far is made up of the United States, Mexico, and Canada) 
represents a concrete goal, and maybe a clearer sign of this 
integration might favor the approval of the pharmaceuticals 
bill." The Argentine rejoinder might have hinted at a softening 
of conditions by Washington: Perhaps a definition of the NAFTA 
issue might still not achieve a final approval of the bill, but 
it might actually achieve a decision by a committee, or in the 
sessions hall of one of the two congressional chambers. 
  The hard -- as graphically described by an Argentine source 
-- one-hour meeting between the president and Clinton's official 
was held at the Carrera Hotel where Menem is staying in 
Santiago. Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella; Hector Gambarotta, 
the Foreign Ministry international economic relations secretary; 
Jorge Herrera Vega, the Foreign Ministry under secretary for 
international economic relations; North America Department 
Director Alfredo Morelli; and Argentine Ambassador to Chile 
Eduardo Iglesias also participated in the meeting. 
  Menem and Kantor met very early, shortly before leaving for 
Valparaiso to participate in outgoing Chilean President Patricio 
Aylwin's transfer of power to Eduardo Frei. In fact, this 
meeting became President Carlos Menem's most important activity, 
which was not included in the protocol, during his quick visit 
to Chile. 
  Upon arriving in Santiago, Kantor, the head of the U.S. 
delegation for the transfer of power, bluntly said: "Chile is 
the country that is in the best position to join NAFTA." He 
extolled Chile's economic and foreign policy, which includes 
precisely the approval of a patents law -- that is, recognition 
of all the "copyrights" for all types of foreign technology 
applied in national manufacturing. 
  The increasingly pressing U.S. interest in the approval of 
an 
Argentine patents law -- there is an official bill in Congress 
that meets Washington's basic specific goals -- is specifically 
linked to the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals with an original 
U.S. formula. U.S. laboratories claim that the lack of 
recognition of their "copyrights" in our country represents a 
yearly $200 million loss for them. 
  Kantor's deadline -- 30 April -- is when the U.S. Government 
will draw up a list of countries that, in the U.S. Government's 
opinion, do not respect the rules of honesty in their trade 
operations structures and which, therefore, will be included in 
the category of candidates for economic sanctions by Washington. 
  The May deadline is also at stake. In May, Kantor himself 
must define those countries that will be able to initiate the 
process of joining NAFTA. Chile is clearly the first candidate, 
but Argentina and Colombia already have status as precandidates 
[precandidatos]. 
  Menem and Di Tella had confirmed Argentina's interest in 
joining NAFTA -- this issue has just been discussed in a 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South] meeting in Buenos Aires -- 
when they discussed with Kantor Clinton's proposal for an 
Americas' Summit. Following the presidential inauguration in 
Chile, and pursuant to the contents of a personal letter from 
Clinton that Kantor delivered to Frei, it became known that this 
summit, which is scheduled to define a sort of continental 
globalization of political, economic, and social strategies, 
will be held in Miami in December, even though a precise date 
has not yet been set. 
  During his private talks with Frei on 11 March and on 9 
March 
Menem did not discuss the issue of his new Chilean counterpart's 
upcoming "private meeting" with former British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher, who will visit Santiago next week to lecture. 
She was invited by Sofofa [Industrial Development Association], 
Chile's largest employers' enterprise. Thatcher will reportedly 
be paid $100,000 for her lecture. 
  Curiously enough, entrepreneurs with large investments in 
our 
country, like Heliodoro Matte, are among the sponsors of a visit 
eliciting strong reactions from the Argentine Foreign Ministry. 
The two presidents also did not discuss what would happen when 
Thatcher bumps into Argentine Defense Minister Oscar Camilion 
during their visit to the aeronautical exposition in the Chilean 
capital.

<F P=106> [Article by Paz Tejerina] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella on 9 March forecast 
that if Argentina is on the list of countries chosen by the 
United States to join NAFTA, "we would not be able to join it 
until 1987." 
  Bilateral negotiations with Washington to join NAFTA will 
not 
harm Mercosur [Common Market of the South], he added. 
  The Argentine position, however, is still undefined. The 
economic plan launched by Brazil in the past few days created 
expectations among the negotiators and even a political position 
in Brazil in the face of its new international situation. 
  The truth is that Argentina continues to strongly defend 
Mercosur even though the other member countries turn their back 
on the agreement. The importation of subsidized wheat from the 
United States and Canada is an example of this. 
  Foreign Trade Under Secretary Carlos Kesman said he will 
again ask the Brazilian Government to apply compensatory rights 
for the measure. 
  Since 9 March, Argentine and Brazilian negotiators have put 
on the table in the Argentine Foreign Ministry the policies they 
must follow during the next 10 or 20 years. 
  Now that Brazil finds itself supported by an economic plan, 
it will attempt to turn away from its previous policies. 
  In principle, there are two subjects that must be discussed: 
  On the one hand, whether Argentina should join NAFTA 
together 
with the rest of the Mercosur member countries. 
  On the other hand, whether to establish a more flexible 
system by which each country could individually negotiate its 
membership. How will this mechanism be applied? The Argentine 
negotiators answered this with complete silence. 
  Now, what is the position chosen by Argentina? Kesman 
answered: "For the time being we will join NAFTA together with 
Mercosur." 
  Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo believes the last word has 
not been spoken yet and the position expressed by Kesman could 
be modified in hours. 
  In turn, the United States believes that if Brazil joins 
NAFTA it would represent a trade exchange of $800 million, while 
it would only amount to $46.6 million with Argentina, Kesman 
said. 
  It is clear that the United States does not care whether 
Mercosur can join NAFTA in bloc or partially because its 
interest is centered mainly on Brazil. 
  The best move for Brazil now is to consolidate its position 
in South America, and Argentina plays an essential role in this 
strategy. 
  In order to attain this, the Brazilian economic plan should 
work. Argentina, which still holds some doubts, has chosen to 
play it safe in case of a failure. It has opted to side with 
Mexico, which currently is at a disadvantage for not meeting 
ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] norms. 
  Cavallo's aides earnestly defended Mexico's position in case 
the Brazilian economic plan fails, in order to be able to join 
NAFTA. 
  What if Mexico then does not act in favor of Argentina? 
According to Kesman, it could be deprived of all the 
preferential treatment it currently has with other countries. 
  During a news conference, Kesman acknowledged the Argentine 
strategy of increasing trade with Brazil, Colombia, and Chile 
and to making a strong move toward the United States. 
  He said the agenda established in Colonia, Uruguay, to 
implement a common external tariff within Mercosur will be 
respected. 
  Kesman said that in April he will meet with the Mercosur 
evaluating group to analyze the accomplishments of the 
agreement's terms as well as the tariffs for capital goods, 
trade, customs, and macroeconomic subjects. 
  So far, Argentina has lost the first round, that is, to stop 
its trade partners from importing subsidized products.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella by LA NACION </F>
correspondent Graciela Iglesias in Paris -- date not given] 
  [Text] [Iglesias] What commitments are involved in OECD 
membership? Are there any fees to be paid? 
  [Di Tella] Yes. A yearly fee will have to be paid. The 
amount still must be established, but it will be established on 
the basis of a small percentage of our gross domestic income. 
Being an OECD member represents ample benefits, especially 
because the membership represents a "certificate of quality" for 
our country -- not only in the economic field but also in other 
significant fields for the OECD like human rights, respect for 
democracy, and political stability. I am convinced that this is 
so to the extent that as soon as we become full-fledged OECD 
members, the international banks' interest rate for Argentina 
will be reduced. 
  [Iglesias] Beyond the Chiapas events, Mexico is another 
Latin American country that soon will become an OECD member. 
Mexico, however, is not a Development Center member. Why is 
Argentina following that strategy? 
  [Di Tella] It will enter at the end of the year. I do not 
harbor any doubts. And this makes our acceptance unavoidable. 
Mexico used a different path because it had specific U.S. 
support stemming from the NAFTA issue. 
  [Iglesias] And who supports Argentina? 
  [Di Tella] Our actions. 
  [Iglesias] Nevertheless, it is known that the Japanese 
delegation opposed Argentina's entry at the OECD council. 
  [Di Tella] It was not the Japanese position alone. The OECD 
was reluctant to increase the number of its members. It does 
not want to go from 24 to 40 members. Their requirements 
involve domestic policy (respect for human rights, democracy), 
foreign policy (cooperation), and market economy. Not all the 
developing countries have these conditions. We now are able to 
portray a consistent model in this regard. Our international 
policy is one of cooperation. We do not view conflict as a 
basis for our relations. We have good relations with Chile, 
Brazil, the United States, and the United Kingdom in everything 
except one issue. 
  [Iglesias] Concerning this issue, you have told LA NACION 
that your British counterpart gave you satisfactory explanations 
on the shipment of a Harrier plane to Chile, his visit to the 
Malvinas Islands on 2 April, and [Margaret] Thatcher's visit to 
Santiago. What were these explanations? 
  [Di Tella] Among other things, Douglas Hurd told me on 3 
March that this Harrier plane was not used during the 1982 
conflict. Nevertheless, he especially emphasized that 
Chilean-Argentine harmony is essential because his country wants 
to invest in our region. I am not concerned by his visit to the 
Malvinas Islands. In five years, he never went there. In a 
certain way, it represents a reaction to our policy of constant 
actions that forces him to overcome his inertia. And I am 
already aware of the fact that there will be ultranationalists 
who now will accuse me of "overemphasizing the Malvinas issue" 
after they used to say that I "underemphasized the Malvinas 
issue."

<F P=106> [Article by Daniel Santoro; copyright by CLARIN] </F>
  [Text] Seven words uttered by British Foreign Minister 
Douglas Hurd produced a smile on the face of his Argentine 
counterpart, Guido Di Tella. Hurd said: "We could possibly 
agree on broad cooperation" on the oil exploration the Kelpers 
want to initiate by the end of the year in the waters 
surrounding the Malvinas Islands. British sources told CLARIN on 
12 March that Hurd made this remark to Di Tella during a meeting 
last week in London. 
  As CLARIN already announced, this definition will be the new 
basis for the position the British will champion late this month 
or in early April when negotiations attempting to achieve some 
form of cooperation on the oil issue will be resumed. 
Negotiations have been suspended since late 1992, when the 
United Kingdom unilaterally decided to initiate seismic 
prospecting work in the sea bed surrounding the Malvinas Islands 
despite Argentine protests. 
  Initially, Hurd talked about cooperation alone, which 
ideally 
represented exchanging information. British sources announced 
that, in diplomatic parlance, however, this new definition means 
that London "is willing to accept the participation of Argentine 
companies in the exploration effort and the replenishment and 
repair of oil platforms in Argentine ports." A similar message 
was conveyed by the British ambassador in Buenos Aires, Peter 
Hall, to Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella during a 
meeting they held on 7 March to discuss the crisis in Yugoslavia. 
  Nevertheless, this is not the final British position. Hurd 
will travel on 9 April to the Malvinas Islands for consultations 
with the islanders -- who refuse to restore communications with 
Argentina -- before initiating negotiations with Buenos Aires. 
The Malvinas Islands' residents only are willing to cooperate 
with Argentina "if necessary" and are moving ahead -- full steam 
-- with their preparations: They already have received a Royal 
Geological Service report recommending where to drill in order 
to determine the existence of oil and establishing the required 
legal or tax framework. 
  Incidentally, this is one of the most difficult points for 
negotiations that demonstrates that both oil and fishing are 
closely linked to the sovereignty conflict. Argentina wants to 
collect part of the taxes that will be charged to the oil 
companies, but the United Kingdom rejects this possibility, even 
though it is not yet known with complete certainty if there is 
oil. 
  Florencio Acenolaza, the Chamber of Deputies Foreign 
Relations Committee chairman and a geologist by profession, 
recently noted in a communique that there is no oil in the 
Malvinas Islands' submarine shelf. 
  YPF [Government Oil Deposits] President Jose Estenssoro 
quickly went to the Foreign Ministry to make it clear that 
Acenolaza based himself "on outdated information" and that YPF 
is studying one of the two seismic surveys carried out in the 
Malvinas Islands last year. Official sources confirmed to 
CLARIN that the survey was purchased through a YPF subsidiary. 
The report is confidential because it is a commercial secret. 
  Nevertheless, the existence of hydrocarbons will not be 
proven until the sea bed is drilled, despite the positive 
seismic reports. The basins may be empty, with more gas than oil 
or with little oil, which would make the business unprofitable.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] One of the weak legs in the economic plan is shaking 
a bit more. Last year's trade deficit reached 3.6 billion 
pesos. But the members of the economic team do not seem to be 
worried. 
  As a counterbalance, it was officially announced that the 
February inflation rate was zero, while wholesale prices dropped 
0.2 percent. 
  Economic Programming Secretary Juan Llach said that with 
these results Argentina has reached the cost of living 
percentage of the developed countries. Reaching a trade balance 
in the short term is, however, very far away. 
  LA NACION was able to learn from a reliable source at the 
Economy Ministry that December 1993 imports reached 1.55 billion 
pesos and exports 1.05 billion pesos. 
  For some analysts, the figures for the first 11 months of 
last year published by INDEC [National Institute of Statistics 
and Census] should cause alarm. In 1992 the negative balance 
reached 2.8 billion pesos, and in only one year the trade 
balance has registered a significant deficit. 
  During 1993 the deficit grew more than was expected by 
Economy Ministry officials, who find an explanation in an 
increase of capital goods imports. 
  They said: "The country is re-equipping itself." 
  But the truth is that the increase in capital goods imports 
was minimal compared to the high increase in the balance of 
payments. In 1992 the increase in the balance was 37.5 percent, 
while in 1993 imports grew 40.9 percent. 
  A difference in the deficit of 700 million pesos in 12 
months 
is not small, and everything seems to indicate that this trend 
will continue. 
  In 1993 exports grew at a rate of 7 percent, while imports 
went over that figure, reaching an 11 percent increase. 
  The arguments used by the aides of Economy Minister Domingo 
Cavallo have created concern among some analysts, who do not 
doubt their assertion that the same negative trend will continue 
in the next few months. 
  Trade with the United States would be one of the main 
reasons 
that the Argentine trade balance is in the red every month. Of 
the total deficit, about 2.2 billion pesos is reportedly with 
that country. 
  Argentine imports from NAFTA were 18.3 percent higher than 
in 
1992. 
  Of the 3.7062 billion pesos in imports, 92 percent came from 
the United States. 
  The other face of the coin was improvement in trade with 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. In this case the 
negative balance was reduced by three-quarters as compared to 
the trade deficit of 1992. 
  The deficit was 500 million pesos in 1992, while in 1993 the 
deficit was only 146 million pesos. 
  In the first 11 months of 1993 imports increased by 31.9 
percent in capital goods, 5.2 percent in vehicles, 7.7 percent 
in consumer goods, and 7.1 percent in intermediate products. 
  Another reason why the trade balance continues to be 
negative 
is the lack of exports by car manufacturers. 
  It has been learned that the auto industry has a debt of 
approximately $300 million, without counting the 21,000 cars and 
spare parts included in Protocol 21 (agreement with Brazil). 
  The destinations of Argentine exports were: $2.5218 billion 
to Brazil, $1.187 billion to the Netherlands, and $1.1294 
billion to the United States. The total sales represent 40 
percent of the sales abroad. 
  The main Argentine imports came from: the United States, 
with 
$3.411 billion; Brazil, with $3.219 billion; Germany, with 
$921.7 million; and Italy, with $879.5 million. 
  INDEC also confirmed that during the first 11 months of 
1993, 
27.3 percent of exports were products of the industrial sector, 
37.6 percent from the agricultural sector, and 26 percent were 
primary products. 
  This shows a drop in the exports of agricultural products 
and 
an increase from 22.7 to 27.3 percent of industrial products. 
  This week Industry Secretary Carlos Magarinos will announce 
a 
package of measures to help regional economies. New instruments 
are expected to be implemented to improve exports. 
  There are indications the economic team is working to try to 
cover the hole produced by the overevaluation of the local 
currency. 
  We will have to wait.

  [Text] There is a paradox: According to a survey 40 percent 
of those polled have a good opinion of the president, although 
42.8 percent oppose his reelection. There is also no strong 
consensus about privatization or the reform of the labor law. 
  With just a few weeks to go before the elections for 
Constituent Assembly conventioneers, support for President 
Carlos Menem and his economic policy is still strong. 
  This is the result of a Lynch, Menendez, and Nivel Company 
survey of 1,000 Buenos Aires and greater Buenos Aires residents 
who, according to the National Electoral Directorate, could vote 
in the elections slated for 10 April. The survey was carried 
out in February. 
  According to this survey, 47 percent of those surveyed have 
a 
positive impression of the president, while 29.4 percent have a 
negative impression. The ratio is therefore 1.6 in favor to one 
against. 
  As to the performance of the administration, 40.8 percent 
consider it good, 32.8 percent see it as average, and 25 percent 
think it is bad. Concerning Menem's reelection in 1995, 41.7 
percent supported it while 42.8 percent were against it. 
  The economic policy obtained the support of 44.5 percent of 
those surveyed, while 24.5 percent opposed it. The ratio was 
1.82 for to one against -- very similar to that of Menem's 
performance as a whole. 
  Meanwhile, the privatization policy was viewed favorably by 
only 35.4 percent, while 33.6 percent had a poor opinion of it. 
  The figures changed remarkably regarding the reform of the 
labor law. While 41 percent opposed it, only 19.6 percent 
supported it, and 27.8 percent of the people surveyed said they 
knew nothing about the subject. 
  The company that did the survey reported that "support for 
Menem, his administration, and his reelection stands at over 40 
percent, which augurs a victory for the administration in the 
elections for Constituent Assembly members." 
  Adriana Martinez Vivot was the coordinator of the survey, 
which was done by sampling and used a questionnaire containing 
both partially open-ended and closed questions. The margin of 
error was estimated at 4.5 percent, which means that the results 
were 95.5 percent reliable.

<F P=106> [Interview with Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim by </F>
Claudia Boragni -- place and date not given] 
  [Text] In an interview with LA NACION, Brazilian Foreign 
Minister Celso Amorim discussed the extent of the Brazilian 
proposal for establishing a South American Free Trade Zone 
(ALCSA). He explained that this undertaking will "not undermine 
the implementation of Mercosur [Co]on Market of the South]," 
although he did express his doubts about Mercosur joining NAFTA. 
  "I envision a favorable disposition on the part of the 
Argentine Government," said Amorim. His words were reconfirmed 
by Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, who said that 
"although it is still premature to issue an opinion in this 
regard, Argentina will not have any objections to the Brazilian 
proposal because we do not want Mercosur to be a closed bloc." 
  [Boragni] What is the extent of ALCSA? 
  [Amorim] The idea is to have a full free trade zone for a 
10-year period similar to GATT; that is, an area that will 
encompass 80 percent of regional trade and will not be 
detrimental to the participation of Mercosur member countries in 
other free trade blocs. I am specifically referring to other 
regional agreements such as ALADI [Latin American Integration 
Association] and the Andean Pact, for example. 
  [Boragni] What mechanism will be used to implement this 
initiative? 
  [Amorim] This is still being discussed by the four 
signatories of the Asuncion Treaty. Brazil does not uphold a 
rigid proposal, otherwise we would not have come to Buenos Aires 
to discuss it with our partners. We are waiting for a 
counterproposal. 
  [Boragni] What do you think will be the impact on 
Argentine-Brazilian trade? 
  [Amorim] Bilateral trade will not be affected at all. On the 
contrary, Brazilian-Argentine trade ties with other South 
American countries will increase. What is important here is 
that if ALCSA is approved, commercial trade with all countries 
will increase. 
  [Boragni] Has the Argentine economic team been consulted on 
the issue? 
  [Amorim] Yes, and I saw a very favorable disposition. I see 
no doubts about the agreement's objective. 
  [Boragni] Is this Brazilian proposal a no to NAFTA and 
Mercosur? 
  [Amorim] Quite the contrary. Mercosur continues to be our 
top priority, including that pertaining to free trade and the 
definition of a common customs tariff (AEC). 
  At any rate I must stress that for Brazil, the Mercosur 
proposal cannot be excluded. 
  [Boragni] What is Brazil's position regarding Mercosur 
joining NAFTA? 
  [Amorim] I believe this is something that does not depend on 
us. The United States will surely indicate with whom it wishes 
to negotiate. If Brazil is accepted, we will be willing to join 
NAFTA. And if Argentina is invited to negotiate, we will have to 
see how to make it compatible with our commitments with Mercosur. 
  I believe it is not technically easy to join NAFTA but it 
surely is possible. 
  [Boragni] Brazil has just launched an economic plan. Does 
your government foresee a greater economic recovery? 
  [Amorim] The big problem affecting the Brazilian economy is 
inflation. In spite of it, however, in 1993, Brazil experienced 
an economic growth ranging between 5 and 6 percent. The 
automobile industry achieved a record production. But the main 
objective of Finance Minister Cardoso's economic plan is to 
achieve economic growth under stable conditions. I believe that 
both the business sector and the people have had a very positive 
reaction.

<F P=106> [Report by Norma Couri] </F>
  [Text] Lisbon -- Until now only prostitutes, mules, 
pineapples stuffed with cocaine, traffickers, and undesirable 
emigrants [as published] have ever been detained at the Portela 
airport: Never weapons. But customs officials confiscated a 
mislabeled package which was found to contain 500 Taurus 
revolvers from Brazil bound for Iran. 
  The Portuguese security service, concerned over the role as 
a 
distribution point for weapons to the world, decided to shed 
some light on the subject. The first to mention the subject was 
Eduardo Damaso of the daily PUBLICO, who long ago began tracking 
weapons deals from Latin America, via Portugal, to Eastern 
countries. It is now public knowledge that Brazil uses Portugal 
as an transit point in the sale of weapons through the Barcarena 
Gunpowder Company, which denies knowledge of the content. 
  The company maintains that the shipment "contained 300 
barrels and triggers sold as spare parts" and asserted that 
"this is not war materiel." Airport customs, which has kept the 
package for the past three months, asserts that it contains 
revolvers. It is charging $200 per day storage. 
  The Barcarena Gunpowder Company explains that it was 
"tricked" because it thought there were no direct flights 
between Brazil and Iran. The Portuguese media has reported the 
arrival of Iranians in Portugal, coinciding with the visit of 
CIA Director James Woolsey. Damaso reports on meetings between 
Iranians and other foreigners in Portuguese hotels to settle 
deals involving war materiel. 
  The Brazilian consulate and the embassy in Portugal deny 
knowing anything about the weapons stored at the airport. 
Brazilian military attache Colonel Chuquer commented that 
Taurus is a private company and that "the United States, for 
example, is one of its best clients."

<F P=106> [From the "JB Report" column by Teodomiro Braga] </F>
  [Text] The Workers Party [PT] is the target of the 
bombastic charge made in Rome on 8 March by Rio de Janeiro Judge 
Carlos Amorim. 
  Amorim charged that a Brazilian party has received money 
from 
the Italian mafia, but he declined to reveal the name of the 
party involved. PT members themselves, however, believe that 
Amorim was referring to the PT. 
  Luiz Salomao, leader of the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] 
bloc 
in the Chamber of Deputies, added more fuel to the fire by 
proposing the creation of an ad hoc committee to probe into the 
charge made by the judge, who will be called to testify. 
  PT leaders have described the charge as another fabrication 
designed to undermine the presidential candidacy of Lula [PT 
leader Luiz Inacio da Silva], and noted the connection existing 
between Amorim and [PDT leader and Rio de Janeiro Governor 
Leonel] Brizola. 
  The suspicion stems from the fact that it was Brizola who 
during his first term in office appointed Amorim to the Rio de 
Janeiro bench. 
  The charge caused excitement in the camps of other Lula 
adversaries, who speculated about further charges of foreign aid 
to the PT. 
  Associates of union leader Luiz Antonio Medeiros have stated 
that Medeiros has evidence of the transfer of funds to the PT 
from the Communist Party of the now defunct GDR.

  [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso announced 
on 9 March that import tariffs on a long list of products that 
are manufactured by sectors that are run by oligopolies will be 
reduced to 2 percent. This is the government reaction to the 
indifference shown by the oligopolies to the stabilization plan 
and to excessive price increases. The list includes food 
products (canned food in general), cleaning and hygiene products 
(razor blades, toothpaste, tooth brushes, etc.), tires, ink, 
dyes, varnish, and chemicals used for the production of 
medicines. The minister said: "This measure will solve this 
problem. The country cannot bear speculation. Speculators will 
see that the government will take a firm line." 
  The measure is a victory for the group within the government 
which advocates stronger intervention to check price increases, 
over another more liberal group which managed to shelve a 
provisional measure that sought to regulate action against 
abuses. 
  Minister Cardoso said the government saw that prices of 
products whose import tariffs will be reduced were increased far 
beyond the inflation rate of the past 12 months. Cardoso said 
the resolutions to reduc these tariffs -- there are 
approximately 20 -- will be published in today's official 
gazette. Consequently, as of today importers will be able to 
bring those products to the domestic market at lower prices. 
  Cardoso said: "I believe this measure will send a strong 
signal that the government is determined to prevent 
speculation." Beside reducing customs tariffs, the government 
will enforce measures to de-bureaucratize imports and facilitate 
the purchase of foreign products. 
  The government published in yesterday's official gazette a 
list of 33 chemicals used for manufacturing medicines whose 
import tariffs were reduced to zero. The measure is valid until 
31 December 1994, because Mercosur [Common Market of the South] 
regulations will come into force on 1 January 1995. 
  Jose Milton Dallari, a special adviser to Minister Cardoso 
and a member of the so-called more liberal group within the 
government, does not support a control on the prices of 
oligopolies' products. He said: "If I go to a supermarket and 
protested against price increases, what would happen? Nothing, 
because people are tired of it." He says this is the main 
reason why he supports negotiating abusive price increases, 
discarding the idea of imprisonment, which Minister Cardoso has 
advocated.

  [Text] Jakarta, 9 Mar (PL) -- Foreign Ministers Roberto 
Robaina of Cuba and Ali Abdullah Alatas of Indonesia ratified 
documents here on a new commercial and economic cooperation 
agreement, which is expected to contribute to strengthening the 
ties between Cuba and Indonesia. 
  The exchange of protocols followed a meeting between Robaina 
and Indonesian Trade Minister Satrio Budihardjo Joedono. 
Robaina arrived in Jakarta last night on the first leg of a 
three-week visit to the Asian region that will take him to Laos, 
Myanmar (former Burma), Cambodia, India, Vietnam, and Malaysia. 
  During a news conference following the signing of the 
agreements, the Cuban official affirmed that his visit to the 
region seeks to explain the situation his country experiencing. 
  Robaina indicated that Asia needs to know what Cuba is and 
that we need to know about this continent. That is the reason we 
are making a big effort to bring an end to the unjust U.S. 
blockade against our country, he added.

  [Text] Bangkok, 11 Mar (PL) -- Thai Foreign Minister 
Sunsiri Prasong said today although his country's trade with 
Cuba is small, it can be increased somewhat, stated sources of a 
high-level Cuban delegation passing through that nation. 
  During a meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina, 
who made a stopover in this capital before continuing his trip 
to Laos, Prasong termed his colleague's visit as "timely in 
discussing trade links." 
  At the same time the chief of the Thai Foreign Ministry 
expressed his regrets the United States is still maintaining its 
blockade against Cuba when the international scene is totally 
different than in 1962, when the pressures were initiated, the 
source has said. 
  Although Robaina's visit was not official, the local 
authorities seemed interested in talking with the Cuban foreign 
minister, who said: "We have come to learn and receive an 
update on the economic transformation process that is occurring 
in the region, of which there are matters we can learn and 
assess." 
  Cuba has a great interest in strengthening its political 
relations and trade ties with the Asian nations, the Cuban 
foreign minister said. 
  Likewise, Robaina said a visit such as the one to Indonesia 
and a passing through Thailand during the first leg of his tour 
through Asia guarantee the tour's success, which began this 
week. This tour includes seven regional nations. 
  Robaina termed as very satisfactory the results of his visit 
to Jakarta, saying there are export possibilities of products 
Cuba can offer, such as pharmaceuticals. 
  Thailand, a founding member of the organization of the 
Southeastern Asian Treaty, maintains together with Indonesia an 
accelerated economic growth and stands out as one of the 
followers of the so-called Asian Dragons or new industrialized 
nations.

  [Text] Rangoon, 12 Mar (PL) -- In official talks after his 
arrival today in this capital, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina expressed to Ohn Gyaw, his Myanmar (former Burma) 
counterpart, Cuba's desire to explore new venues of bilateral 
cooperation. 
  Robaina arrived in Rangoon today, the third leg of his tour 
of seven Asian nations that he began in Indonensia then 
continued to Laos. After a two-day visit in Myanmar, he will 
travel to Cambodia, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam. 
  During the meeting, both sides reviewed relations, which 
were 
described as good, between the two states and projects of common 
interest, which they agreed will require further study. 
  Ohn Gyaw expressed interest in the possibility of hiring 
Cuban health specialists, as well as in a project to develop 
tourism in this country. 
  Ohn Gyaw also voiced his admiration for Cuba, which he 
visited last year to explore areas of cooperation, praising the 
social achievements of the past three decades. 
  Robaina's visit is viewed as a reaffirmation of the friendly 
relations between Havana and Rangoon, despite the distance 
separating both countries. 
  Robaina's agenda includes several meetings with top 
government leaders. Prior to his departure to Cambodia on 14 
March, he is scheduled to meet Vice Admiral Maung Maung Khin, 
prime minister of Myanmar [title as received]. 
  Before traveling to this capital, Robaina met in Vientiane 
with Laotian President Nouhak Phoumsavan, Foreign Minister 
Somsavat Lengsavat, the ministers of trade, nutrition, finance, 
and other personalities. 
  Following a very tight agenda, Robaina has tried to 
accomplish the objective of his tour to southeast Asia: to 
promote closer relations with the region and make known the 
Cuban reality.

  [Text] Rangoon, 14 Mar (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina described as positive the talks held in this 
capital with Myanmar (former Burma) Prime Minister Than Shwe and 
several government officials 
  Approached by the local media, Robaina, who has already 
spent 
a week visiting Asian countries, said that they discussed many 
issues concerning the development of political and economic 
bilateral relations. 
  Although no agreements were signed during his visit, Robaina 
pointed out that broad prospects to develop ties between the two 
nations were created. This is the first trip a ranking Cuban 
official has made to Myanmar. 
  Meanwhile, President Than Shwe conveyed to Robaina his 
government's wish to exchange delegations of specialists and 
businessmen to explore trade prospects between the two nations. 
  He also indicated that both Myanmar and Cuba are the target 
of similar manipulation campaigns by the West and because of 
that, he added, they need to know each other better. 
  Myanmar, a nation bordering China and India, produces mostly 
rice (15 million tons a year), although it has large mineral 
deposits and timber reserves. 
  Its economy today is beginning to flourish in the area, 
especially with regard to foreign investment. Its leading trade 
partner is China, although other countries in the area have a 
steady relationship with this country. 
  In addition to being greeted by President Than Shwe, Robaina 
met with counterpart Ohn Gyaw, Chamber of Commerce President U 
Koko Gyi, Development and Planning Minister Brigadier General 
Abel, among other government officials. 
  Yesterday, Robaina visited several new communities on the 
outskirts of Yangon, the Shwedagon Pagoda, which is the largest 
Buddhist shrine in the world. He also visited a university and 
the Yangon sports complex, where a Cuban boxing trainer has been 
working since 1993. 
  During all the meetings, the hosts expressed their interest 
in the current Cuban situation and in seeking new forms of 
cooperation that yield mutual benefits. 
  Robaina and his delegation will leave today for Cambodia, 
and 
will later visit India, Malaysia, and Vietnam in the last phase 
of his Asian tour, which has also included Indonesia, Thailand, 
and Laos.

  [Text] Bangkok, 14 Mar (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina, who tomorrow will be in Cambodia for the fourth 
leg of his seven-country tour, said here today that Cuba has 
found new possibilities for exchanges and communication in Asia. 
  In an exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA, the Cuban 
foreign minister, who in addition to Thailand has already 
visited Indonesia, Laos, and Myanmar (formerly Burma), said that 
his hosts have expressed interest in negotiations with Cuba in 
the fields of health, biotechnology, and sports, among others. 
  He said that Cuba does not go around making only appeals, 
that Cuba has much to offer the world also, especially this part 
of the world. He noted that right now his country is facing 
many needs and that other countries could make investments based 
on those needs. 
  In his opinion, Cuba must analyze the economic boom in this 
region and determine what can be tailored to fit Cuba's needs. 
  Robaina emphasized that our diplomacy's main objective is to 
contribute, within the framework of an economic model that must 
be, above everything else, Cuban and viable, to the solution of 
the problems we have. 
  Robaina said that so far the most important aspect of his 
tour, which will also include India, Malaysia, and Vietnam, has 
been the understanding and opportunities he has found for 
explaining Cuba's true situation. 
  Robaina noted that the persons with whom he has held 
meetings 
so far have expressed respect for the way the Cuban people have 
resisted and for how, in the midst of difficulties, the island 
has begun to show recovery symptoms. 
  At times like this we have to function with a new-style 
diplomacy, one mindful of the main problems all nations face. 
  After intense sessions in Myanmar and Thailand, Robaina left 
for Cambodia where he is scheduled to meet with the prime 
minister of that kingdom, Sdeth Krom [as received], and National 
Assembly President Chea Sin, among other government leaders. 
  This is the first official visit of a prominent Cuban 
Government leader to Cambodia since the establishment of peace 
and stability in that nation.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, 14 Mar (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Relations 
Minister Roberto Robaina today started an official visit to 
Cambodia, the fourth leg of his tour of seven South and 
Southeast Asian countries to reinforce ties with that region. 
  This will be the first high-level contact between Havana and 
the government of Phnom Penh which was elected last year under 
UN auspices. 
  The Cuban minister will meet with his Cambodian counterpart, 
Norodom Sirivuth, who will welcome him officially at the capital 
city airport of Pochentong. Sirivuth is the younger brother of 
King Norodom Sihanouk. 
  Sirivuth will attend to the visiting delegation in his 
capacity as acting head of government in the absence of Prime 
Ministers Norodom Ranarith and Hun Sen, who are abroad. 
  Robaina will also be greeted during a special audience with 
Chea Sim, the acting head of state and president of the National 
Assembly, who has for the past months represented Sihanouk, who 
is receiving medical treatment in China. 
  Before heading for Phnom Penh, the head of Cuban diplomacy 
visited Indonesia, where he started his tour, Laos, and Myanmar 
[Burma], and he made a stopover in Thailand's capital, Bangkok. 
  His next destinations are India, Malaysia, and Vietnam. 
  Robaina told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba has found new 
possibilities for exchanges and communication with the countries 
that he visited. He added that the hosts voiced their interest 
and desire to negotiate with Havana in the areas of health, 
biotechnology, and sports, among others. 
  In his opinion, Cuba must study the economic explosion 
experienced by this region and determine what is most applicable 
to its own situation. 
  The most important aspect of this tour, Robaina pointed out, 
is the degree of understanding and the opportunities we have 
found to explain the true reality of the Cuban project.

  [Text] Havana, 13 Mar (PL) -- Today, the weekly JUVENTUD 
REBELDE denied Colombian daily EL TIEMPO reports of a meeting of 
Colombian guerrillas in Cuba and the existence of an office of 
Colombian rebels in Havana. 
  JUVENTUD REBELDE carried a lengthy report entitled Neither 
an Office, Nor a Rebel Summit in Havana, refuting the reports 
published by the Colombian newspaper on 10 March based on 
sources it never identifies. 
  The report added that one does not have to be Sherlock 
Holmes 
"to see EL TIEMPO's wicked intentions of trying to start a 
scandal" shortly after the Colombian Government announced its 
decision to sell 15,000 to 20,000 barrels of oil per day to Cuba. 
  JUVENTUD REBELDE said the lies published by EL TIEMPO also 
coincide with attacks against the trade agreement by Alexander 
Watson, U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American 
affairs. 
  A JUVENTUD REBELDE reporter visited the building in Havana's 
Alamar neighborhood, in Habana del Este Municipality, where 
according to EL TIEMPO, the rebels reportedly had an office, 
which residents in the area denied. 
  It is a building like any other, said Chilean painter Tato 
Aires, who has been living at D-2 in Zone Seven of that 
neighborhood for the past two months. 
  Several Latin American families live in the building, which 
the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples (ICAP) made 
available to them while they are residing in Cuba. 
  One of the tenants is Colombian citizen Alexander Salcedo, 
20, who is studying medicine in Cuba thanks to his father's 
efforts, who has been receiving medical treatment in Cuba for 
the past six years. 
  Salcedo said there is no guerrilla office in that building, 
adding that he has no links with rebels or political parties in 
his country. 
  JUVENTUD REBELDE also noted that none of the Colombian 
guerrilla commanders mentioned by EL TIEMPO are on the 
participants list of a meeting of nongovernment, social, and 
human rights organizations held here two months ago. 
  The publication stressed that while EL TIEMPO publishes 
those 
lies, it omits reports of attacks by ultraright sectors of Cuban 
immigrants in Miami against Colombian citizens.

  [Text] Havana, 13 Mar (PL) -- A source in the Cuban Foreign 
Relations Ministry has noted that Cuba will seek means to 
contribute to the creation of the Caribbean States Association 
[Asociacion de Estados Caribenos -- AEC] during a preparatory 
meeting that will take place next week in Jamaica. 
  Foreign Ministry official Omar Morales told PRENSA LATINA 
that since the beginning, his country was pleased with the idea 
of creating the AEC because it is considered an important step 
toward regional and Latin American integration. 
  He underscored that Cuba's main objectives at the meeting 
that will be held 16-18 March in Kingston will be to work toward 
integration and to tighten the cultural, scientific, and 
technological ties of the countries of the region. 
  The Caribbean Basin and Central American countries, as well 
as the countries of the Group of Three (G-3) -- namely Colombia, 
Venezuela, and Mexico -- should comprise the AEC. 
  Morales added that the largest Antillean island is 
considered 
a potential member of the future AEC and that "we are willing 
and politically determined to take part in all of the regional 
integration processes." 
  Morales said the Foreign Ministry commends this project, 
"because we are, above all, members of the Caribbean." 
  Asked about the importance of this zone for Cuba, he replied 
that the island's current trade with these countries amounts to 
some $25 million, which he deemed "a significant amount." 
  "This area has a lot to offer us in the tourist sector, and 
Cuba, as member of the Caribbean Tourism Organization, has 
signed agreements in this sector." 
  He said the signing of other agreements on the tapping of 
maritime resources and transportation also confirm the need for 
a greater Cuban presence in the region. 
  He added that, after the Kingston meeting, the foreign 
ministers of the member-nations will meet to sign the charter 
and that the AEC will become a reality with the signatures of 
the heads of state. 
  "The preparatory work will conclude sooner than later, and 
everything will be ready to make this project a reality," he 
underscored. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Ramon Sanchez-Parodi will head the 
delegation that will go to Kingston.

<F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] [no dateline as received] -- Unnoticed by most of 
the large international media, and yet a startling event for 
those who became aware of it, the 35 Haitians the U.S. Coast 
Guard left to the fate of being devoured by sharks in the open 
sea dramatically shows the tragic consequences of a wrong 
immigration policy. 
  The unlucky ones -- those who fled horror and persecution in 
their own country aboard a flimsy boat that capsized off the 
Bahamian coasts -- became fodder for the sharks that swarm these 
waters after they called insistently and unsuccessfully on the 
U.S. Navy to help them. 
  Complying with the provisions in effect in the United 
States, 
the U.S. Coast Guard opted to conduct another task at that time: 
to pick up a group of Cuban rafters who were on their way to 
Miami and escort them to U.S. territory. 
  In this case, as always, the Cuban rafters were received as 
heroes. The media were called to interview them, and they were 
asked to condemn the Havana government publicly, which seems to 
be an essential requirement to being welcomed warmly and 
affectionately. 
  The U.S. immigration provisions, which Havana deems as 
political tools used in a campaign against the revolutionary 
process taking place on the Caribbean island, encourage this 
type of arrival along the U.S. coast. These policies even 
include the right to possible employment. 
  As if this were not enough, the so-called rafters -- some of 
whom fall prey to drug traffickers who charge high fees for the 
odyssey and some of whom never reach their destination because 
they disappear at sea -- can apply for permanent residence in a 
year. This option is repeatedly denied to other applicants. 
  The daily, weekly, monthly, and annual publication of the 
number of Cubans who, according to U.S. statistics, avail 
themselves of this possibility after leaving Cuba illegally is 
part of the anti-Cuban strategy being implemented by Washington. 
  Of course, this policy is complemented by repeated 
rejections 
given to many Cubans who go to the U.S. Cuban Interests Office 
in the island's capital to request a visa to visit their 
relatives or to opt for residence in the United States. 
  An immigration agreement signed years ago by the governments 
of the two countries states that Washington will authorize up to 
20,000 visas for Cubans, but the Cuban Government has repeatedly 
accused the other party of violating this agreement by granting 
a ridiculous number of travel permits. 
  This contrasts with Havana's evident easing of its 
immigration process, which now allows any citizen over age 20 to 
travel freely, as long as he has the required visa to the place 
he wants to go. 
  Because accepting Haitian refugees is not a U.S. political 
priority, the conditions established for these people are 
completely different. 
  All boats taking these emigrants to U.S. territory are 
intercepted and forced to return to their place of origin, even 
though this might mean, according to repeated reports by Haitian 
organizations, delivering them back into the repression from 
which they escaped. 
  Tragic events such as this are repeated and, more than once, 
have caused international scandals, as was the case of the 
confinement of thousands of Haitians at the Guantanamo Naval 
Base that is occupied by the United States in eastern Cuba. 
These Haitians were detained there for months and lived in dire 
conditions. 
  Nevertheless, on this occasion, the tragedy reached 
unsuspected proportions, because the refusal to help the 35 
Haitians who were trying to find haven in the United States 
simply turned them into food for sharks; indeed, those who could 
help them were absolutely unconcerned about this. 
  An eloquent depiction of the U.S. position was the desperate 
attempt made by another Haitian to pass himself off as a Cuban 
named Felipe Gonzalez, but the authorities discovered his true 
identity and arrested him upon his arrival in U.S. territory. 
  Haitian protests and the tragic results of the 
aforementioned 
event could definitely become a powerful topic of discussion at 
the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Javier Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 11 Mar (PL) -- It appears that the U.S. 
blockade on Cuba -- which is harmful to the Cuban economy, which 
the island occasionally sidesteps, and which is being questioned 
in the United States -- is destined to develop growing cracks. 
  According to analysts and observers, the signs pointing in 
this direction are becoming increasingly clear while the Cuban 
economy is showing a modest reactivation, and foreign 
investments in the country are growing. 
  The intense business activities being conducted on the 
island 
and the increase of foreign investors who want to negotiate with 
Cuba to participate in various industrial and service sectors 
are unprecedented in the entire history of the revolutionary 
process that began in 1959. 
  According to official sources, 413 commercial enterprises 
from about 40 countries already have subsidiaries in the 
country, and 129 economic agreements with foreign firms have 
been signed. 
  Right now, buzzwords that touch on production, productivity, 
and the concepts of quality and cost control are being heard not 
only from knowledgeable economists and foreign businessmen, but 
also from workers in the parliaments in the workplace, as well 
as on the job. 
  This setting will gradually, but definitely, lead to a 
cleansing of the domestic finances and to investments that are 
necessary in sectors severely hampered as a result of years of 
U.S. hostility and the disappearance of the European socialist 
bloc. 
  This means that the Cuban people, who have grown used to 
coming up winners in a countless number of difficult situations 
over the past four decades, are now focusing their efforts on 
overcoming an adverse situation characterized by economic and 
supply restrictions imposed by international circumstances. 
  At the same time, important political decisions, such as the 
convoking to "the Nation and the Emigrants" conference in April, 
are being adopted. This is the latest step taken along the path 
of normalizing relations between the government and Cubans 
living abroad. 
  In addition to contributing to the reuniting of families and 
to a certain degree of participation by emigrants in national 
affairs, the meeting is another factor that contributes to 
inspiring trust in the soundness of the current global policy of 
the Antillean nation. 
  Things being as they are, the ongoing blockade imposed 32 
years ago and maintained by successive U.S. governments that 
have wanted to liquidate the Cuban revolutionary process is 
increasingly showing various signs of breaking down. 
  Evidence of this is the increased interest that nations from 
various parts of the world are showing in trading directly with 
Cuba, despite White House pressure and the disgust that such 
trade sparks in the anti-Cuban lobby that functions close to 
U.S. Government circles. 
  The finding of such interest in Latin America -- the region 
of the world of which the island is a part -- has special 
significance, but we also find such interest among the West 
European powers and in countries in Africa and Asia. 
  The increase in visits to Cuba by foreign delegations to 
explore trade relations or to sign agreements, as well as the 
bilateral agreements that have either been signed or are being 
negotiated, are also evidence of what we have affirmed. 
  The role Cuba has played in international forums such as the 
Ibero-American summits and the United Nations, in addition to 
Cuba's stand in defense of Latin America's integrationist 
philosophy, have also harmed the isolationist objectives 
Washington has obsessively pursued with regard to the Antillean 
nation. 
  The crisis of the U.S. blockade is also mirrored by the 
desperation that, according to what AREITO magazine Director 
Andres Gomez has revealed, has overcome the people's calling for 
a hardening of the blockade -- namely, those people who have 
turned their life in exile into a lucrative business. 
  Recently, while grand caravans of solidarity with Cuba 
cruised the United States and Canada to transport aid to the 
island, a costly mobilization by bellicose groups that function 
in the United States was able to gather only a few hundred 
people in Washington. 
  Meanwhile, several legislators have presented at the U.S. 
Congress a bill to weaken the so-called Torricelli Law which 
hardened the conditions of the blockade, and this is another 
factor to be taken into consideration at this moment. 
  Taking into consideration all these factors, it looks like 
modifications are inevitable and that the hopes of those who 
dream of a return to the past in Cuba will collapse.

  [Text] Havana, 10 Mar (PL) -- Cuba's Executive Secretariat 
for Nuclear Affairs (Sean) completed 38 scientific studies in 
1993, it has been officially reported in this capital. 
  Of these studies, 10 were ranked as outstanding, and one 
entitled the Environmental Radiological Study of the Republic of 
Cuba won an award from the Academy of Science of Cuba (ACC), one 
of the most important awards of all the institutions under the 
ACC. 
  According to Sean, in the 1993 contest the introduction and 
categorization of studies of previous years were made. 
  Among these studies is one of three varieties of rice in 
which genetic traits were introduced via irradiation, and one of 
the technology for activating polystyrene plates [placas de 
polistireno], which are of great use for investigations of 
various types. 
  During this period, different institutions sold and 
contracted 12 pieces of equipment developed by specialists from 
the Center of Applied Studies for the Development of Nuclear 
Energy (Ceaden). 
  In addition, it was learned in 1993 Sean guaranteed the 
country's basic services in the field of dosimetry and 
radiological protection. 
  Sources of nuclear energy that were not being used in the 14 
provinces and in the special municipality of the Isle of Youth 
were gathered and rendered inactive and were taken to the 
nuclear waste site near the outskirts of the capital. 
  During the period, nuclear experts were able to maintain a 
stable functioning of the national network of radiological 
operations. 
  Other works continued by Cuban atomic energy experts with 
the 
arrival of new patients concerns the evaluation of radiation 
effects on children from Chernobyl at a tourist installation 
east of Havana. 
  After a detailed study of current conditions, it was agreed 
to maintain the nuclear option in the electromagnetic Cuban 
system. 
  During the last six months of last year, work was done in 
this regard, and a gradual national planning strategy was 
devised to face the future programs of nuclear energy 
development. 
  The construction of the first electronuclear center (CEN) on 
this Caribbean island has come to a standstill due to the 
difficult situation the Cuban economy is facing. 
  A program in which nuclear builders and experts will 
participate was designed to offer maintenance to installation 
programs. This will be done until conditions permit the 
completion of the first two reactors in the central-southern 
Province of Cienfuegos. 
  Meanwhile, qualified personnel of the first Cuban CEN have 
devoted their work to applying nuclear energy to other fields, 
so as to contribute to national economic development.

  [Text] Havana, 9 Mar (PL) -- More than 27 million pesos, 
which is equivalent to $27 million at the official exchange 
rate, was donated during 1993 by workers to finance Territorial 
Militia Troops (MTT), Cuba's largest defense corps. 
  The Cuban Workers Federation (CTC), which is comprised of 
all 
the country's unions, said today that this was a record 
collection among Cuban workers for this purpose. 
  The MTT, formed by volunteers from all Cuban neighborhoods, 
are comprised of several million people and their main task is 
to support the regular troops in repelling and defeating any 
enemy aggression. 
  Cuba's concept of defense is basically based in popular 
participation in fighting foreign invaders, and it is called the 
war of all the people. 
  The CTC said, in a report on the donations to finance these 
militias, that more than 4 million pesos collected was payment 
for voluntary work.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Rodolfo Robles -- the first one he </F>
has granted since he and his family were granted political 
asylum in Argentina in May 1992 -- by Carlos M. Reymundo Roberts 
at Robles' apartment in the Palermo neighborhood of Buenos Aires 
City; date not given] 
  [Text] [Roberts] What is your opinion of the sentence 
handed down by the military court [on the murder case involving 
nine students and a professor from La Cantuta University in 
Lima, Peru]? 
  [Robles] This has been a step forward because it presupposes 
the acknowledgement that the murder was indeed committed, as had 
been charged. Nevertheless, only the ones who committed the 
murder were punished -- the Colina group from the National 
Intelligence Services (SIN). The mastermind behind the murder 
-- Presidential Aide Vladimiro Montesinos -- and the person who 
executed his commands -- General Nicolas Hermoza, the chairman 
of the Armed Forces Joint Command -- emerged unscathed. 
  [Roberts] How do you know that Montesinos ordered the 
murder? 
  [Robles] Because that group answers directly to him. What 
the sentence says, namely that it was a "personal initiative 
without having been ordered by their superior" is not true. 
  [Roberts] What is the reason for such brutal murder at La 
Cantuta University? 
  [Robles] Those people are completely deranged and Montesinos 
hired them precisely because they have no scruples. They seem 
to have no principles at all. They feel powerful because they 
have the backing of the country's rulers and think it makes no 
difference whether they kill sheep or people. 
  [Roberts] Was there any proof that the university students 
were involved in terrorist activities? 
  [Robles] No, that allegation has never been proved. They 
were not found in possession of subversive literature, weapons, 
or leaflets ... They offered no resistance! They were most 
brutally abducted and murdered. Their bodies were then 
quartered and burned. The sadism in this action has nothing to 
do with the way the true Peruvian Army acts. 
  [Roberts] What was Gen. Hermoza responsible for? 
  [Robles] It is my considered opinion that he was implicated 
in this affair because the Colina group operation was supported 
by several units that answer directly to him. In such a special 
operation, one that entailed entering a university, no general 
would have dared take a step without being authorized to do so. 
  [Roberts] Did any of the military who were found guilty not 
plead during the trial that they were obeying orders from their 
superiors? 
  [Robles] It seems that they did not, but their attitude is 
quite understandable -- there are many ways to coerce a person 
into submission through promises, blackmail, threats ... They 
are well aware that intelligence services have their own rules 
of conduct and that they can pay very dearly if they happen to 
ignore them. 
  [Roberts] Do you believe that the sentences have been very 
lenient? 
  [Robles] Had they been tried by a civilian court, the 
sentences would have in all likelihood been much more severe. 
The truth is that the crimes they committed -- labeled homicide 
because there was no violent clash between them -- do not exist 
in the Military Justice Code. Hence, they had to somehow make 
these crimes fit in there so that the military could be tried by 
a military court. 
  [Roberts] Was it an obvious case of civilian jurisdiction? 
  [Robles] Absolutely. The law passed by Congress to remove 
the case from a civilian court was most aberrant and cast 
discredit on the rule of law in Peru. It was a gross 
interference by the legislative branch in the realm of the 
judiciary. A specific law was passed for this trial which goes 
against all legal regulations. Congress bowed to this trick 
because it is in the hands of a group of cowardly and obsequious 
people who are at Fujimori's beck and call. 
  This law was enacted when it seemed imminent that the 
Supreme 
Court was going to rule that a civilian court had to hear the 
case. Overcome by despair, they urgently convened a session of 
Congress -- even obliging those deputies who were on holiday to 
be present at the debates -- and passed the law. It was such a 
scandal that the U.S. and German Governments strongly protested, 
and the prime minister had to resign. 
  This laid bare the fact that the belief that there is a 
democracy in Peru is totally erroneous. What we have is a 
dictatorship by Fujimori propped up by a military coterie. 
  [Roberts] Some contend that Vladimiro Montesinos is a sort 
of 
black monk who wields as much -- or more -- power than the 
president himself. 
  [Robles] That is true -- many of the changes, the true 
quakes 
that are taking place in our institutions, have been the work of 
his hand. 
  As is public knowledge, Montesinos is a former Army captain 
who has protected drug traffickers. In fact, he has not severed 
his ties with them. He was cashiered from the Army following 
his conviction for treason, as he had sold confidential 
documents to other countries. 
  [Roberts] Can it be said that human rights are 
systematically 
violated in Peru? 
  [Robles] The Colina group -- not the Army -- has indeed been 
violating human rights in a systematic way. Hiding themselves 
under the false colors of countersubversive struggle, they are 
involved in these criminal actions, which in many cases are 
perpetrated to eliminate those who oppose the government. 
  [Roberts] Do you agree with Fujimori in the sense that 
Shining Path is about to be routed? 
  [Robles] I hope so because they are the worst scourge we 
have 
ever had. Nevertheless, it is quite difficult. This is an 
overly triumphant attitude by Fujimori in order to be 
re-elected. The Shining Path continues to wreak havoc in our 
country.

  [Text] Caracas, 12 Mar (EFE) -- Members of an Army 
intelligence unit detected and dismantled a network of concealed 
microphones at Miraflores Palace, seat of the Venezuelan 
Government. The Army is now seeking the "brains" of the 
espionage system, the local press reported today. 
  Unofficial sources at Miraflores Palace remarked that the 
microphones had been placed in the main rooms of the building, 
including the office of President Rafael Caldera and the room 
where the Council of Ministers meets regularly. Although it has 
not yet been confirmed, it is believed that, through this 
high-technology system, those responsible for telephone 
espionage also had access to the main offices of the Ministry of 
Defense. 
  A report published by the daily "EL GLOBO" states the 
system's connections reportedly linked the network to the 
private offices of former President Carlos Andres Perez and the 
main office of Banco Latino, in which the government intervened 
last January and where a sophisticated espionage center was 
discovered. 
  Following the bank intervention, congressional investigators 
asserted that hundreds of telephones of prominent Venezuelan 
political and business personalities were wiretapped from that 
office, but the wires leading to hidden microphones were not 
discovered. 
  However, it has not been ruled out that the investigation 
will follow this course, especially if it is confirmed the 
network discovered at Miraflores leads to terminals located at 
the main office of Banco Latino, whose former President Gustavo 
Gomez Lopez is accused of planning a coup d'etat. 
  The location of Gomez Lopez, for whom an arrest warrant was 
issued over the bankruptcy of Banco Latino, is not known. It is 
only known that he is abroad. However, on several occasions 
Gomez Lopez has contacted local media to reject the accusations. 
  Even so, Venezuelan political leaders view Gomez Lopez as 
the 
main ideologist of a coup d'etat, planned with former Defense 
Minister Radames Munoz. This coup attempt was reportedly aimed 
at preventing the electoral victory of Rafael Caldera last 5 
December. 
  Those who made accusations against Gomez Lopez argue the 
intentions of the banker and Munoz were definitely foiled after 
the military officer disclosed his plans to U.S. Government 
officials, who warned they would not go along with an attempt 
against the Venezuelan democratic regime.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 15 
March. 
  Orinoco Iron and Steel Works, Sidor, and Colombian Steel 
Works Corporation, Acesco, signed an agreement allowing Sidor to 
open an office in Bogota. According to Sidor, Colombia is one of 
the corporation's main sheet metal customers, and "having an 
office in Bogota will allow Sidor to compete with similar 
suppliers from Japan and Brazil." Company officials reported 
that "this agreement is part of the overall economic integration 
process." (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 10 Mar 94 p E11) 
  Overall exports dropped 53.2 percent in January compared 
with 
January 1993. The Central Statistics and Data Processing Office, 
OCEI, reports that exports totalled $414 million. Meanwhile, 
imports fell 43.3 percent for the same period. Experts said 
"Venezuela's 1993 economic situation was the worst in recent 
years." Inflation closed at 50 percent for the year, the bolivar 
was devaluated 35 percent, and the deficit hit 3 percent of the 
GNP. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 0006 GMT 10 Mar 94) 
  Nontraditional exports to the United States increased 27.6 
percent during 1993 while imports fell 8 percent. The Foreign 
Trade Institute (ICE) and OCEI reported that the United States 
purchased products worth $746.3 million in 1993, which is 23.1 
percent of total Venezuelan nontraditional exports. Imports from 
the United States dropped about $444.3 million, although such 
transactions totalled 12.13 percent of Venezuelan exports in 
general. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in Spanish 11 Mar 94 p 
15] 
  Fedecamaras, Venezuelan Federation of Associations and 
Chambers of Commerce and Industry, has issued its monthly 
inflation report. The study shows that inflation dropped in 
February to 1.9 percent, a 55.8 percent decrease from January 
1994 and 26.9 percent less than February 1993. The main 
contributors were home expenditures, clothing, and food and 
drink. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 12 Mar 94 p E10) 
  Following congressional approval of the Emergency Banking 
Law, the finance commission approved the Public Credit Bill, 
which will fund the former. Acting Finance Minister Luis 
Grisanti said the bill "will not have inflationary effects and 
will not force the Central Bank of Venezuela to print money 
without appropriate reserve funds." He stressed the need to 
restore financial equilibrium, as "solving the financial 
difficulties of several Venezuelan banks is closely related to 
the process of restoring trust." He added that "this will in 
fact bring down inflation, reduce the exchange rate, and cut 
interest rates." (Caracas Venezolana de Television Network in 
Spanish 0000 GMT 13 Mar 94) 
  Nonpetroleum product exports to Andean countries increased 
in 
the last five years from $190 million to $862 million. ICE said 
"this figure is unprecedented in the trade relations among the 
region's countries." Sales to the Andean countries totaled 10.5 
percent of Venezuela's total exports in 1988 and rose to 26.3 
percent in 1993. The main items exported to the region are 
aluminum, urea, cane sugar, polyesters, coal, antibiotics, and 
other medicines. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 2241 GMT 14 Mar 94)

<F P=106> [Report by Aquileo Sanchez Viquez] </F>
  [Text] [Costa Rican] Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus arrived 
on Thursday in Santiago de Chile. During a news conference, 
discussing his candidacy for the post of OAS secretary general, 
he indicated he has the support of 22 nations, which guarantees 
his election. 
  He denied St. Lucia, Dominican Republic, and Ecuador had 
changed their opinion, adding that these rumors only seek to 
dilute support for him. The official reported having the 
support of the Central American bloc, Caribbean community, 
Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Chile, whereas Venezuelan 
Miguel Angel Burelli has the support of two nations, and 
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, the support of eight. 
  During a subsequent interview with LA REPUBLICA, Niehaus 
said 
Chile backs him. He announced he will try to meet with 
Brazilians and Uruguayans to try to get their endorsement. The 
foreign minister dismissed as mere rumors the reports that an 
international pressure campaign -- in which the U.S. Department 
of State is reportedly participating -- is forcing several 
countries to withdraw their support for the Central American 
candidacy. 
  He noted, however, that manifestations of this strategy have 
been the "ridiculous" ideas that the Central American isthmus 
and the Caribbean want to have control over the inter-American 
system or that Caribbean islands are disgruntled over the banana 
problem. 
  Niehaus indicated that many countries that have endorsed 
President Gaviria already feel uncomfortable with a pledge that 
will have a negative outcome. Further, the official said that 
on 28 March, after he is elected, he will visit the authorities 
of the countries that did not vote for him so that together, 
recognizing the will of the majority, they can work to make the 
OAS regain a protagonist role in fighting poverty and developing 
the entire continent. 
  As for other pending matters, he indicated the main factor 
will be national unity regarding this candidacy. [Costa Rican] 
President-elect Jose Maria Figures gave the best example when he 
set aside his partisan stance and publicly endorsed him. Along 
these same lines also, the rumors of another Costa Rican 
candidacy were dispelled when former President Oscar Arias 
publicly backed Niehaus at the start of the campaign for the 
OAS. "Any other Costa Rican or Central American candidacy would 
break the existing bloc. [no closing quotation mark as published]

  [Text] OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares arrived on 
16 March in Buenos Aires to attend a meeting of regional 
security experts. According to diplomatic sources, the main 
subject Baena Soares will discuss in the meeting he is scheduled 
to hold today with President Carlos Menem will be the situation 
in Haiti. 
  Before his meeting with Menem, Baena Soares will hand him 
the 
1994 Inter-American Leadership Award granted by the Panamerican 
Development Foundation, an organization linked to the OAS. 
  The true reason for Baena Soares' visit to Argentina, 
however, is the battle over his succession that must be decided 
in less than two weeks. The struggle among the strongest 
candidates -- Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Costa Rican 
Foreign Minister Bernard Niehaus Quesada -- is so hard that the 
third candidate -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Burelli 
Rivas -- predicted on 16 March that the OAS secretary general's 
election, scheduled to be held on 27 March, will not be decided 
in the first round. 
  Baena Soares's succession was complicated by Gaviria's 
unexpected candidacy, which was supported by Argentina despite 
having committed its vote to the Costa Rican foreign minister. 
The Colombian president's candidacy was launched by the United 
States and this, according to Burelli Rivas, "changed the rules 
of the game."

  [Text] We learned today that the Central American countries 
will propose to the OAS a plan that provides for suspending the 
blockade imposed by the United States against Cuba over three 
decades ago. This was reported by diplomatic sources in 
Tegucigalpa tonight [16 March]. Those circles also confirmed 
that the proposal will be made to the regional organization 
after the election of a new secretary general to replace 
Brazilian Joao Baena Soares.

  [Text] The process of integrating the Caribbean began today 
with a meeting of experts in Jamaica that is to last until 18

  [Text] Cuba ratified its call for integration during the 
technical meeting for the establishment of the Association of 
Caribbean States, which is being held until Friday at the 
convention center of Kingston, Jamaica. Most of the heads of the 
delegations present at the meeting, most of which are countries 
bordering the Caribbean, participated in yesterday's opening 
session. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Ramon Sanchez Parodi said that Cuba 
supports efforts to establish the Association of Caribbean 
States during the technical meeting in Kingston. In an interview 
with PRENSA LATINA, Sanchez Parodi pointed out that the event's 
highlight was the coincidence of criteria by specialists in 
creating the association. 
  Sanchez Parodi also said that the delegations are analyzing 
other aspects of regional organization. Sanchez Parodi went on 
to say that experts from Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, and 
representatives of the French Government for Caribbean 
departments voiced their points of view on the scope and 
perspectives of the future organization. 
  Today, the agenda to create the Association of Caribbean 
State will focus its technical discussions on membership, its 
main departments, the adoption of decisions, and financing -- 
elements that make up the project of creating the association. 
Observers believe that another meeting of specialists may be 
necessary prior to the summit of heads of state and government, 
who will approve the organization.

  [Excerpt] Today, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
began his 48-hour tour of New Delhi. Early this morning, Robaina 
held a meeting with his counterpart, Dinesh Singh, during which 
the two diplomats reviewed the historically friendly relations 
between Cuba and India. During this encounter, Dinesh Singh 
expressed his admiration for the Cuban people's efforts to 
resist the economic difficulties they are facing. He went on to 
say that India will continue supporting Cuba in international 
forums. 
  Roberto Robaina said: Even though the two nations have 
always 
maintained close ties, we should take advantage of this occasion 
to take practical steps to search for common interests that 
could deepen trade relations. 
  The diplomats agreed to meet again in June, during the 
summit 
of nonaligned countries to be held in Cairo to discuss the main 
problems of developing nations. Both diplomats expressed 
themselves in favor of strengthening the work of the Nonaligned 
Movement. 
  Just hours prior to his meeting with his counterpart, 
Robaina 
placed a floral wreath at the Indira Gandhi memorial here in the 
capital. He also visited the Red Fort, the most important 
monument in New Delhi, which gives a complete vision of Muslim 
scholars' way of life. 
  Today's most important event was a meeting that Roberto 
Robaina held, just minutes ago, with 60 businessmen at the 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, where the Cuban foreign 
minister gave a comprehensive explanation of the outlook for 
investment in the island. He said: Even though there is a 
certain preference toward Latin American countries in order to 
achieve greater regional integration, we must give consideration 
to the countries like India that have stood by us during 
difficult times. 
  There was great interest on the part of the Indian 
businessmen in learning of possibilities for investment in 
biotechnology, pharmaceutical products, tourism, fishing, 
textiles, and agriculture. Robaina explained that today Cuba 
does not have enough capital but does have a great human 
resource and an existing infrastructure, which are primary 
factors for joint ventures. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A meeting of Army General Raul Castro Ruz with 
outstanding journalists, the president of UPEC [Union of Cuban 
Journalists], and the directors of the principal mass media 
today [17 March] became a fruitful exchange of opinions and 
information regarding the progress of defense tasks, as well as 
an interchange about other national current affairs topics. 
  This dialogue, during which journalists who were awarded the 
Jose Marti national journalism prize for 1993 participated, was 
a continuation of the Revolutionary Armed Forces' [FAR] homage 
to press workers begun at a recent meeting with Division Gen. 
Ulises Rosales del Toro, head of the general staff. 
  In an event that lasted for more than seven hours at FAR 
Ministry headquarters, the participants received detailed 
information on improving the FAR, with the objective of adapting 
its structures, systems, and activities to the nation's economic 
possibilities. 
  The FAR minister spoke at length about these subjects and 
explained in detail experiences and results obtained by the 
FAR's regular troops, and especially the EJT [Youth Labor Army], 
both in agricultural-livestock production earmarked for 
self-sufficiency and that earmarked for the population. 
  Another aspect amply discussed by Army Gen. Raul Castro was 
the process of perfecting the FAR's managerial system, in 
operation for several years now, which is characterized by its 
comprehensiveness. 
  In the name of those present, UPEC president Tubal Paez 
called the meeting a great gift to the sector and reiterated all 
journalists' commitment to remain, as has been the case up to 
now, in the front line of combat in defense of the Revolution. 
Paez affirmed that the FAR Ministry and the commander in chief 
have, in Cuba's journalists, one of their principal weapons.

  [Text] Today, in an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Ricardo 
Alarcon de Quesada, president of the National Assembly of the 
People's Government, stated that thousands of proposals made by 
workers have already been implemented to restructure the 
domestic finances of the country. Alarcon said that the workers 
parliaments have served for collective discussion of possible 
measures in general so that each worker can express his or her 
opinion and hear the opinions of others to form a collective 
criterion. 
  The leader of the Cuban parliament pointed out that just as 
important as this aspect was the identification by the workers 
parliaments of problems in each work center as well as the 
necessary decisions that would permit reduced costs and 
increased efficiency. Alarcon underscored that, with that in 
mind, they have been able to obtain thousands of proposals and 
specific measures, many of which have been implemented. 
  Alarcon went on to say that the solution of economic 
difficulties is a problem concerning the entire nation and not 
just a group of legislators. He concluded by saying: We must see 
the people's government as it really is: a parliament inserted 
in our society.

<F P=106> [Report by Carmen Castro] </F>
  [Text] The Cuban Government currently is implementing very 
deep economic and political changes. These changes are not well 
understood abroad, but the government continues implementing 
them because we are fully convinced that we will overcome the 
current difficulties. The changes, which also have an important 
influence on foreign relations and seek to meet the needs of the 
new times, began in 1990. They are part of a reorganization 
process aimed at making governmental actions meet the dynamic 
international changes that have had a dramatic impact on the 
lives of Cubans. 
  These comments were made by Luis Suarez, a Cuban expert on 
international matters who heads the Cuban Center for Latin 
American Studies. Suarez was specially invited for President 
Frei's installation and has held several talks on the Cuban 
situation with Chilean Government experts and Chilean Foreign 
Ministry officials. 
  In Suarez' opinion, the current Cuban process cannot be 
called a transition process because these changes began 35 years 
ago. Considering the U.S. policy regarding Cuba, which is 
translated into an economic blockade, he does not believe the 
Cuban situation is critical: 
  [Begin Suarez recording] A country that is only 90 miles 
away 
from the United States, a country that has had its national 
identity attacked by a power as huge as that of the United 
States -- which lies hardly 90 miles from its borders -- finds 
the task of building a national and popular democracy very hard, 
complex, and arduous. Such a task cannot be achieved overnight. 
Therefore, when people talk to me about a Cuban transition, I 
tell them that the Cuban transition began 35 years ago when 
Fulgencio Batista's brutal military dictatorship was ousted and 
Cuba began to build this superior sort of democracy that all 
peoples in the world should yearn to have. [end recording] 
  Suarez' option for the type of government being enforced in 
his country did not prevent him from seeing the difficulties 
faced by the Cuban Government. He said the economic blockade is 
a powerful obstacle to any sort of change and has a dramatic 
impact on the people. Paradoxically, he admitted that if the 
blockade were suspended, it would have a conflictive impact on 
his country. Suarez believes that a society that is blocked and 
besieged develops a culture appropriate to that type of 
harassment. 
  In his opinion, however, it is important to count on active 
and concrete international solidarity. He pointed out that this 
solidarity was translated into $50 million last year and it has 
prevented the island from being ideologically isolated.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish on 16 and 17 March. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 16 March reports that (Miguel 
Marul), president of the Executive Committee of the People's 
Government in the municipality of the Isle of Youth, has 
departed for Italy, which maintains close relations with our 
country and especially with the Isle of Youth. (Marul) said that 
the objective of his trip is to establish cooperation agreements 
and relations of friendship with Bologna and Capri. 
  Radio Reloj at 2034 GMT on 16 March reports that protocols 
have been signed making sister cities of Matanzas and Leon, 
Spain. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 16 March reports that a 
group of 20 managers and experts from Canadian mining companies 
has toured geologic and mining areas of Matanzas, Pinar del Rio, 
Havana, Santiago de Cuba, Holguin, Camaguey, and Villa Clara 
Provinces looking into investment potential. The tour falls 
within the activities prior to the annual convention of Canadian 
prospectors and was organized by the firm (Carib-Gold) and 
Cuba's (Geominera S.A.). The president of (Carib-Gold) expressed 
satisfaction with the results of the visit, as well as great 
optimism, saying in English: "I think it is inevitable we will 
have more business with Cuba." He added: "Up to now we have had 
only smaller companies that are willing to take higher risks and 
invest in Cuba, but I think that this trip is showing there is 
now an interest from some of the major international mining 
companies." Six Canadian mining companies are working in Cuba, 
and another two will begin work in Villa Clara. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 17 March reports that the 
Sergio 
Perez Castillo fertilizer mixer plant in Holguin has been 
70-percent repaired with the purpose of recovering the maximum 
capacity of 500 tons daily. Current investments to recover 
production in Holguin surpass 700,000 pesos. 
  In the same newscast, Rebelde reports from Camaguey that bad 
road conditions in the country have prompted national and 
provincial experts to exchange ideas and experience in the use 
of alternative materials in repaving and repairing roads. It 
reported that Cuba has 14,000 km of paved roads, not counting 
urban and perimeter areas, and that because the distribution of 
asphalt has been reduced since 1989, Cuban crude oil is being 
used in the asphalt mixture, with solid experience obtained in 
Matanzas and Villa Clara. 
  Radio Rebelde adds that Cuba received almost 250,000 
tourists 
last year as a result of Cubanacan operations. This represents 
almost 40 percent of the foreign tourists visiting the country. 
These operations have brought some $96 million to the country, 
although financial contributions by other tourist companies, 
such as civil aviation, have increased this figure to $700 
million. Cubanacan's manager said that tourism activity in 1994 
will surely meet Cuba's goal of 30,000 rooms to shelter 1 
million tourists, who would leave $1 billion in the country. 
  In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that Chinese 
Ambassador 
to Cuba Xu Yicong has delivered a donation of clothing and 
school supplies for the municipalities of Arroyo Naranjo and 
Playa. Pedro Chavez, president of the Havana Provincial 
Assembly, and other local officials were present at the 
ceremony. The Chinese ambassador said that this donation is a 
contribution of the embassy personnel to the country's efforts 
in these difficult times. 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 17 March reports that the 
breakdown of one of the generators of the Carlos Manuel de 
Cespedes thermoelectric plant in Cienfuegos has caused blackouts 
in the capital and other parts of the country, including some 
circuits not usually affected because of the existence of food 
processing plants or other establishments of priority 
importance. Extreme efforts are being made in this plant to 
restore the supply of electricity as soon as possible. 
  In the same newscast, Progreso reports that Sugar Industry 
Minister Nelson Torres Perez has noted the importance of the 
current stage for sugar production. Speaking on behalf of the 
coordination and support group and of the commander in chief, he 
stressed the crucial need to increase production and to defend 
efficiency. 
  Progreso adds that workers of the petroleum drilling and 
extraction company in the municipality of Cardenas in Matanzas 
have promised to extract approximately 1 million tons of crude 
oil this year. Engineer Marcos Aguilera, company director, said 
they intend to produce 230,000 tons by the end of March, which 
is 28,000 tons more than the current plan. Last year the company 
produced 815,000 tons of crude, or 158,000 tons more than in 
1992. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 17 March reports that workers 
of 
the 1 de Mayo Industrial Gas Plant in Havana are working hard to 
put the generator back into operation with a greater capacity to 
stabilize the production of oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and 
compressed air. The main fractionating line of 550 cubic meters 
daily broke down at the end of last year. While repairs are 
under way, workers are performing complete maintenance on the 
plant. 
  In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that cane cutters from 
the transport union in Havana Province have reached their 
objective of cutting 1 million arrobas of cane in tribute to the 
116th anniversary of the Baragua protest.

<F P=106> [Report By Jose Alberto Briceno] </F>
  [Text] On 8 March in Washington D.C., Foreign Relations 
Minister Bernd Niehaus asked Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant 
secretary of state for inter-American affairs, to urge the 
United States to stop "twisting" the arms of Caribbean nations 
to get them to support Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's bid 
to become OAS secretary general. 
  The minister met with Watson before departing for Santiago, 
Chile, where he will attend President-elect Eduardo Frei's 
inauguration. President Gaviria and Oscar Arias, former Costa 
Rican president and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, will also attend 
the inauguration. Arias also has expressed interest in 
obtaining the OAS post. 
  President Rafael Angel Calderon said the only topic Niehaus 
and Watson discussed at their 8 March meeting was the upcoming 
election for the post of OAS secretary general. 
  Calderon added: "We respect the U.S. position to choose 
President Gaviria, but we cannot accept the twisting of arms of 
small Caribbean nations. Niehaus wanted to make this point very 
clear." Calderon made these statements at the inauguration of 
the Monument to the Costa Rican Teacher. 
  In addition, the head of state stressed that Foreign 
Minister 
Niehaus told Watson he expects to maintain good relations with 
the United States as OAS secretary general. 
  The Foreign Ministry's Press Office reported that Deputy 
Foreign Minister Hernan Castro is visiting Saint Vincent to meet 
with representatives of the Caribbean Common Market (Caricom) to 
discuss banana marketing strategies. This visit also seeks to 
reinforce bilateral relations in the wake of statements by 
Caricom Secretary General Edwin Carrington, who said at least 
three countries in the region -- namely, Dominica, Saint 
Vincent, and Saint Lucia -- had withdrawn their support for the 
Costa Rican OAS candidacy. 
  Niehaus, however, noted that this problem has been 
completely 
overcome and that he still has 22 votes in his favor, including 
the votes of the 13 small Caricom states. Meanwhile, President 
Calderon underscored that he has been in contact with the 
Caribbean ministers, adding that Costa Rica is proposing a fair 
and balanced plan that will not hurt their economies. 
  Costa Rica has advocated the broadening of the quota system 
while maintaining a contingency [contingente] that favors the 
islands to ensure that bananas continue to be their main source 
of revenue.

  [Text] Yesterday, by publicly announcing the structure of 
his cabinet during an event at the National Museum, 
President-elect Jose Maria Figueres disclosed that his future 
government will function based on a system of five operational 
fields. 
  The ministries will operate under specific fields in 
accordance with their respective disciplines in such a way that 
they may be able to tackle the country's problems as a team. 
Each of the ministries will be supervised by a general 
coordinator. 
  Three of the fields will be institutional renovation, which 
will be coordinated by Rodrigo Oreamuno, second vice 
president-elect; the economic sector, which will be coordinated 
by Carlos Manuel Castillo (who is also Central Bank executive 
president); and the social sector, which will be coordinated by 
Rebeca Grynspan, first vice president-elect. The other fields 
will be sustainable growth, coordinated by Carlos Espinach; and 
security, supervised by Elias Soley, who has also been selected 
as minister of the presidency. 
  "These fields do not cover all government tasks, but we will 
try to coordinate fundamental aspects of the country's reality 
and take advantage of this plan to implement mechanisms that 
will expedite government decisions despite current institutional 
limitations," Figueres commented. The president-elect warned 
that in selecting his ministers he tried to combine honesty, the 
ability to work as a team, inclination for sacrifice, 
professional excellence, public and private life qualifications, 
equanimity, the ability to reach agreements, loyalty, and 
commitment to the principles of government programs. "I am 
convinced that each one of those who have accepted their 
nomination as minister, will let their work account for the 
decision to appoint them as government ministers," the president 
pointed out. 
  In concluding his speech, Figueres took hold of the same 
mallet which, 45 years earlier his father, Jose Figueres Ferrer, 
had held to strike the walls of what was then the Army General 
Headquarters and today houses the National Museum. Figueres, 
overwhelmed by emotion and with broken sentences, stated amid 
continuous rounds of applause: "Forty-five years ago in this 
same spot and with this same mallet given to me this morning by 
a friend... Don Pepe [Figueres Sr.] came to tear down some walls 
so that instead of armies we would have schools, universities, 
health, and welfare. Today with this same mallet in this same 
spot with all humility and enthusiasm, we come to tear down the 
walls of intolerance ... overtaken with fervor and eagerness to 
work, let us tear down the walls of parochialism and 
incomprehension in our country..." 
  He called on all Costa Ricans to exercise their right to 
"healthy criticism and supervision of the government's 
performance," since he acknowledges the importance of exchanging 
opinions. "However, there is also a need for national unity so 
that the Costa Rican family, despite its political affiliation, 
can solve the [country's] problems and so that these next four 
years may be truly productive," Figueres concluded.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jose Angel Talavera, alias El Chacal, head </F>
of the 3-80 Northern Front, by Luis Adolfo Diaz and an 
unidentified reporter on 16 March in Caulatu; from the "Trench" 
newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Talavera] In the agreements recently reached with 
the government, we were promised that land would be given to 
3-80 Northern Front combatants to help them return to civilian 
life. At a meeting on 15 March, certain difficulties and 
problems arose, which hindered the demobilization of some of the 
3-80 Northern Front's fighters -- a demobilization scheduled for 
16 March. These people need to rejoin civilian life because 
these peasants do not have... [pauses] they live in abject 
poverty; they have no place to live; and so on. 
  They have been hoping that the government will give each of 
them a small plot of land, enough to survive, and that they will 
be given technical and financial assistance, as was agreed in 
past negotiations. Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta, who 
represents the government in these talks, said he was acting in 
good faith, but he noted that decisions are made in Managua. He 
added that the land problem had to be resolved in Managua and 
reviewed in Managua with various ministers -- I think 
specifically with Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo. 
  In turn, today we suspended the surrender of weapons of 
150-200 combatants. The government and the 3-80 Northern Front 
agreed to discuss this issue in Managua over the next four days. 
We have a representative there who is talking to the government 
in an effort to find a way for the government to buy or give 
plots of land to these peasants to allow them to rejoin civilian 
life the day they surrender their rifles. This has to be done 
so they can start working. 
  [Diaz] How did Minister Mendieta explain the fact that the 
government is now claiming it is unable to keep its promise, 
especially given that, when the first 100 men surrendered their 
weapons, he said the government would indeed comply and that it 
was capable of complying? 
  [Talavera] There is problem; there is a problem with the 
central government. I do not know whether President Violeta 
Chamorro has failed to authorize all of the available resources 
to ensure that all demobilized 3-80 Northern Front commando 
units rejoin civilian life. Nevertheless, we are witnessing a 
huge difference between promises and actions. This creates 
distrust among those peasants planning to demobilized. They are 
conveying these feelings to us. These people were prepared to 
demobilize today. 
  They told us they were very disappointed in the government 
because they were extremely interested in surrendering their 
rifles, rejoining civilian life, and farming the land. I do not 
know whether the failure to comply was caused by a lack of 
maturity or responsibility on behalf of the government. The 
government has failed to comply with a promise it is completely 
capable of complying with. We know perfectly well that it has 
funds. The government spends a lot of money on other less 
important areas. This, however, should be a high priority area, 
because peace would be established throughout northern 
Nicaragua. All of these combatants would be contributing to the 
country's economy. 
  [Reporter] Why are negotiations not being held in Managua 
with the Nicaraguan Resistance [RN] Higher Council, instead of 
here in Caulatu? 
  [Talavera] We are working on that. We will see if the 
government allows us to hold the next meeting in Managua to put 
an end to this phase of violence in northern Nicaragua. If this 
happens, we will have a chance to talk with members of the 
cabinet, and the ministers can come up with solutions for these 
people to enable them to finally rejoin society. 
  [Reporter] Do you need the government's permission to go to 
Managua? 
  [Talavera] Obviously we need the government's permission, as 
stipulated in the agreements. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Talavera] Yes, international observers have limitations 
too. 
They have told us that without the central government's 
permission, they cannot transfer from here to Managua any 
combatant of the 3-80 Northern Front who has not demobilized or 
who does not have an I.D. card issued to demobilized members. 
It is the government's responsibility. 
  [Reporter] Do you not feel like a prisoner in these 
enclaves? 
  [Talavera] Not really. Of course, I believe there is some 
disadvantage in holding the negotiations in this area instead of 
in Managua, where talks would have more coverage. If that were 
the case, the government would have to be more sensitive to 
national and international repercussions because we would have 
more chances to talk with domestic and foreign journalists. 
This could benefit us in the sense that, although it is 
feasible to find a peaceful solution for violence in the 
northern region, this subject has not been accorded the 
importance it deserves. 
  [Reporter] What if the government does not allow you to go 
to 
Managua to conduct this phase of the negotiations? 
  [Talavera] I believe this is something the government can 
do. 
If there is real willingness, I believe the government will 
permit a delegation of the 3-80 Northern Front staff to travel 
to Managua to follow up on the negotiations and put an end to 
violence in northern Nicaragua. The government has the last 
word. We in the 3-80 Northern Front are willing to lay down our 
weapons, but we demand compliance with the agreements. We hope 
the agreements do not turn out to be empty promises, as in 
previous years with the RN. 
  [Reporter] Commander Chacal, the RN Higher Council will meet 
with the economic cabinet tomorrow. What actions will the RN 
Higher Council take on your behalf to expedite your 
demobilization? 
  [Talavera] They have plans. They will have the chance to 
meet with several cabinet members. We have confidence in the 
representatives of the RN Higher Council. This will be their 
first opportunity to review the RN's problems in general. They 
have our confidence and our full support. We hope the 
government will listen to them, and that it will not merely make 
empty promises as it has done in the past. We hope specific 
agreements will be reached tomorrow at the meeting with 
representatives of the RN Higher Council.

<F P=106> [Report by Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>
  [Text] General Humberto Ortega declared, following a 
"frank, cordial, and open" meeting with Alexander Watson, U.S. 
assistant secretary of state for Inter-American Affairs, that 
the Sandinist People's Army [EPS] "will never" accept a military 
law approved "under U.S. pressure or by capricious positions." 
  Gen. Ortega added that he will "not retire under anyone's 
pressure, nor will the EPS tolerate another situation similar to 
what took place on 2 September 1993" when President Violeta 
Chamorro announced that the current Army commander in chief 
would retire in 1994. 
  Before departing Nicaragua, Watson commented that what 
happened on 2 September 1993 "was not the result of U.S. 
pressure; she said it was for her own reasons." Watson, who is 
the first U.S. official of his position to meet with the EPS 
general staff, refused to say whether Gen. Ortega should retire 
this year, like Chamorro said in 1993. "The Army and government 
are talking about this very delicate topic," Watson said. 
  In a news conference Gen. Ortega reiterated the EPS 
rejection 
of the human rights report prepared by the U.S. State 
Department. "This report is not objective and does not fall 
within the framework of the relationship that should exist 
between two sovereign countries," Ortega told Watson. 
<H5>  Watson's Promise </H5>
  Presidency Minister Engineer Antonio Lacayo also expressed 
rejection of this document at the Augusto Cesar Sandino Airport, 
where he arrived to bid Watson farewell. Minister Lacayo 
reiterated that the military law draft bill will be in the hands 
of the National Assembly in two weeks at the latest and that the 
U.S. State Department report "is rather old" and is loaded with 
"[word indistinct] language." 
  According to Gen. Ortega, Mr. Watson promised to take into 
account "other Nicaraguan points of view" when drafting the next 
report on the topic. He also insisted that the military law 
"will be a law on which most Nicaraguans agree." 
  Watson stressed that one of the basic topics dealt with 
during his first visit to Nicaragua was human rights and 
reiterated how important it is for the United States "that all 
human rights violators are taken to justice." 
  On the other hand, Ortega, who refused to tell reporters 
whether he would retire or not from the EPS this year, stressed 
to Watson the "deep crisis" that Nicaragua is going through due 
to the high incidence of violence and lack of citizens' security 
and the opportunity the United States has to contribute to 
national stability. "It is useless to move ahead in other fields 
if the country is going to crumble due to problems such as state 
corruption, drug trafficking, etc.," Ortega ended.

<F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo said the visit by 
Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary of state for 
inter-American affairs, was very important and beneficial for 
Nicaragua and that it shows U.S. President Bill Clinton's full 
support for the Nicaraguan democratic process and the Violeta 
Barrios de Chamorro administration. 
  [Begin recording] [Lacayo] We believe the visit was very 
beneficial, productive, and good for Nicaraguans. Mr. Watson 
clearly expressed the Clinton administration's policy on 
Nicaragua in his speech at noon yesterday. He also reaffirmed 
what Ambassador Maisto said here in September. 
  Watson said problems in Nicaragua should be resolved by 
Nicaraguans for Nicaragua. This is indeed a great advancement, 
because previous U.S. administrations had another way of looking 
at things. 
  He also said this administration should end its 
constitutional presidential term normally and turn the 
government over to the duly elected president in the same way 
that [words indistinct] elected. He thus expressed total support 
for the democratic principles, the institutionalization of the 
electoral process, as well as his clear support for the 
government of Violeta de Chamorro, prompting it to continue its 
path toward peace, democracy, and the improvement of our economy. 
  We are very happy with Watson's visit and believe he was 
also 
quite satisfied with the talks he held with several sectors. I 
think the visit has improved relations between Nicaragua and the 
United States and has committed the Clinton administration to 
supporting the work done by Nicaraguans. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [Lacayo] We, through our foreign minister, have already 
expressed the government's point of view on the human rights 
report. We believe the report is outdated and does not reflect 
the real situation in Nicaragua. It is written in very obscure 
language and does not reflect the efforts made by the government 
and all Nicaraguans to live in peace. The people who wrote the 
report were not objective. We stated our position more than a 
month ago when the report first came out, and I reiterate it on 
this occasion. We also understand that other sectors in the 
country commented on the report to Watson. [end recording] 
  Engineer Lacayo also touched on the topic of the massive 
evictions and said such issues are basically handled by the 
judicial branch. 
  [Begin Lacayo recording] It is a matter that concerns the 
judicial branch exclusively. The judges are responsible for 
such issues. The National Police force, in accordance with the 
law, responds to a judge's call when he requests the support of 
the police. We are, however, very concerned because we have 
seen a [words indistinct] and it could be that judges have acted 
illegally in certain cases. That is very dangerous. We have 
already contacted the Supreme Court [words indistinct] to 
express our concern and [words indistinct] that all the judges 
are acting in accordance with the law. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Daisy Villalobos from the "Facing the Moment" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN] 
said on 14 March that the Alfredo Cristiani administration has 
not complied with important aspects of the peace agreements. 
FMLN leader Leonel Gonzalez [Salvador Sanchez Ceren] listed 
four issues that are still pending: public security, land 
transfer, the program to return former guerrillas to civilian 
life, and compliance with the Truth Commission recommendations. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] In terms of the public security 
issue, according to the program to disband the National Police, 
there should also be a program to reduce the size of the 
organization. This program has been suspended, and, therefore, 
the peace plan is not being complied with. Their idea is to 
leave about 3,000 national policemen working until October and 
later recruit them for the National Civilian Police [PNC]. This 
will mark another failure to comply with the agreements. As for 
the PNC deployment, according to the agreements, this process 
should end in September at the latest, but the government wants 
to postpone it until December. A postponement would be another 
failure to comply with the peace agreements. 
  Yet another example of noncompliance is the distortion of 
the 
PNC. We have pointed out this problem since 1993, but it has 
not been corrected. Its civilian nature is not being respected. 
In addition, there is no training to ensure that new agents 
respect life and human rights. Many PNC agents who are linked 
to the [word indistinct] are resorting to the traditional 
methods employed by the repressive corps. 
  As for land transfer, 70 percent of the land has not been 
transferred. In other words, about 20,000 people are facing 
uncertainty because land has not been transferred to them. 
  As for the program to return former guerrillas to civilian 
life, the most worrisome aspect is that former fighters who 
already have land have not yet received loans. The time to sow 
is close at hand, and our companeros are not yet sure whether 
they will receive the necessary loans to farm the land. [end 
recording] 
  The FMLN accused the government of hindering the advancement 
of the pending agreements and noted that there is a new 
timetable proposed by Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] that 
the government has ignored. Leonel Gonzalez believes the 
government wants to continue ignoring the agreements to punish 
former fighters, dodge its responsibility, and merge the 
National Police with the PNC.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] San Salvador Canal Doce Television in 
Spanish at 1245 GMT on 16 March broadcasts live a 105-minute 
debate on the topic of public security with Salvadoran 
presidential candidates: Dr. Ruben Zamora, candidate for the 
Democratic Convergence-Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front-National Revolutionary Movement coalition; Dr. Rhina 
Escalante de Rey Prendes, candidate for the Authentic Christian 
Movement; Dr. Fidel Chavez Mena, candidate for the Christian 
Democratic Party; Edgardo Rodriguez Eigenhart, candidate for the 
National Solidarity Movement; and Colonel Roberto Escobar 
Garcia, candidate for the National Conciliation Party. Absent 
from the debate were: Armando Calderon Sol, presidential 
candidate for the Nationalist Republican Alliance, Arena, and 
Jorge Martinez Menendez, presidential candidate for the Unity 
Movement. This is the second of three scheduled presidential 
debates organized by Canal Doce Television in the 1994 
Salvadoran presidential campaign and moderated by Mauricio Funes. 
  Based on a drawing, Chavez is the first to speak. When asked 
what he would do to solve the problem of crime and provide 
public security in El Salvador, Chavez says he has a five-point 
plan to fight this problem. "We would first take security 
measures to protect citizens, and secondly, we would take 
judicial, corrective, and preventive measures. Finally, we 
would take measures to compensate victims. As for the police 
measures or measures to ensure the protection of citizens, a 
very important aspect is the rescheduling of the peace 
agreements in this area, which is so important for the peace 
agreements. I would not like to list the other measures for 
reasons of time and because I do not want to tire the television 
viewer," he says. Chavez adds: "We have to increase the number 
of policemen as a deterrent. Police presence is important 
especially if it is strategically distributed among the 
population. We have been pointing out since 1991, that there is 
a need to deploy 10,000 policemen at this time. We currently 
have nearly 6,000 civilian policemen, who graduated from the 
Public Security Academy." Chavez ends by saying: "We have the 
problem of private services to deal with, we have to fight 
impunity and corruption, and we need resources to satisfy our 
financial needs." 
  The next candidate to answer the same question is Rodriguez. 
He says: "We believe the National Civilian Police, PNC, in 
view of the urgent need to implement the peace agreement, has 
been poorly trained. We believe the length of training was too 
short. A good policeman needs approximately two years to be 
well trained and he needs to be in a constant retraining stage 
to have a better awareness of the laws, procedures, 
investigative techniques, and human rights. We also believe 
that since the deadline is rapidly approaching, the National 
Police must hand over to the PNC all its equipment, weapons, 
transportation and communications equipment, and all other 
logistics supplies so as to immediately strengthen the PNC with 
the resources already in the country without the need to incur 
greater debts." 
  Presidential candidate Zamora, when explaining the steps he 
would take to fight crime, says: "We must end the impunity 
given to organized crime by the government in our country and we 
must also draft judicial reforms." "We must support the 
deployment and development of the PNC. Those are the three 
major points of our public security policy." Zamora says that 
during the first six months of his government, the following 
measures would be taken: "We are going to completely review all 
the irregularities in the fulfillment of the peace agreements 
regarding the PNC. The UN Observers for El Salvador [Onusal] 
sent a letter to the UN secretary general pointing out all the 
ways in which this government has failed to comply with the real 
purpose of the PNC. Secondly, we also have to deploy the PNC 
before September. The Police Academy says it should be ready by 
September. We also have to completely reorganize the Interior 
and Public Security Ministry because starting in July, the PNC 
will be under the control of the Interior Ministry." 
  Zamora also lists his three great national campaigns. "Our 
first campaign is against organized crime. Starting on 1 June 
and running through 31 December we have to take exemplary 
measures so that organized crime understands that if it violates 
the law, it will pay for it in our government. Our second 
campaign is the national disarmament campaign to collect all 
weapons of war in private hands and to register weapons. 
Remember that a law was passed in January to register all 
weapons in private hands within a 90-day period. This government 
has done nothing. An office to receive permit requests has not 
even been set up. We will have to extend the 90- day grace 
period and do it right so that our Armed Forces can really 
conduct this campaign promptly. The third campaign is the 
national campaign to clean up public administration. We are 
going to fight government corruption and contraband beginning on 
our first day in office." 
  Dr. Rhina Escalante de Rey Prendes, the only woman 
candidate running for the Salvadoran Presidency, says she 
disagrees with the dissolution of the security corps and that 
"the logical thing would have been a gradual purge of the 
Treasury Police and the National Guard." She adds that if she 
wins the election she will review the peace agreements and 
propose to the United Nations that "as long as we do not have a 
well-equipped PNC with enough members, the present National 
Police should continue to operate, forgetting about this year's 
October deadline." She adds that "with an efficient police 
force and good cooperation from citizens, we should be able to 
improve justice administration to provide better guarantees to 
witnesses and accelerate the proceedings to prevent bureaucracy 
from discouraging citizens wishing to cooperate." 
  Finally, Roberto Escobar Garcia agrees with Rey Prendes and 
says that "the sudden dissolution of the public security corps, 
the National Guard, and the Treasury Police left a terrible void 
in the country that has not been filled." He says that the PNC 
should be trained to prevent crime rather than repress it and 
that it must be turned into an auxiliary body within the 
administration of justice. 
  Moderator Mauricio Funes then asks if the candidates think 
the National Police can operate without the security corps and 
if the current system should be kept. Chavez answers by saying 
that despite the flaws the peace agreements should be observed. 
"In this regard, the Armed Forces can help by conducting air 
patrols. We must evidently extend the disarmament law," Chavez 
says. 
  As for transferring resources from the National Police to 
the 
PNC, Rodriguez Eigenhart says: "Foreign assistance to strengthen 
the PNC could be sought, but a greater budget for the PNC can be 
allocated in the national budget. Every time we talk about 
problems we only think about asking for foreign aid. Why not 
think about curtailing public expenditures so that we do not 
have to depend on what may or may not come from abroad?" 
  When asked about the lack of security in the streets because 
of the absence of the security corps, presidential candidate 
Escobar Garcia says: "We have to create a strong link between 
the PNC and the Attorney General's Office. The former can 
prevent crimes from being committed, and the latter can conduct 
technical investigations after crimes have been committed." The 
National Police has to be strengthened as much as possible even 
though the foreign assistance that has been promised has not 
arrived yet, Escobar Garcia says. 
  Chavez Mena talks about the importance of making deep 
judicial, constitutional, and criminal code reforms. "We have 
to classify the different types of criminals. We have to 
implement new punishment alternatives and insist on solving the 
impunity problem." He insists that the fundamental 
responsibility for any of the mistakes that may have been 
committed in the peace agreements lies with Arena's lack of 
responsibility. 
  Finally, the candidates discuss problems of contraband, 
corruption, and the breakdown of moral values in the country.

  [Text] In its government platform for the 20 March 
elections, the coalition comprising Democratic Convergence [CD], 
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN], and the 
National Revolutionary Movement [MNR] promises to ensure an 
orderly transition to a new stage of historic development in 
terms of democracy, economic growth, and social justice. 
  The program, which is entitled "A Proposal for Dialogue," 
includes the following areas: 
<H5>  Democratization </H5>
  The coalition proposes the free organization and constant 
participation of the people in state decisions, the 
strengthening of political pluralism, and an electoral system 
that guarantees clean elections. 
  The coalition also recommends granting autonomy to 
government 
branches; reforming the legislative branch; reforming the 
judicial system; banning illegal arrests, home searches, and 
espionage; and eradicating foundations of organized crime. 
  The coalition promises to guarantee freedom of worship and 
improve government relations with all churches; establish a

that 
protects organized crime and corruption. It promises to respect 
freedom of expression and private property. 
  It pledges to settle accounts regarding public finances and 
to eliminate corruption, to transfer resources and 
decisionmaking power to the municipalities, and to modernize 
public administration.

air, water, and life [al aire, al agua y a la vida]; to promote 
a culture of peace; and to abide by the constitutional mandate 
to promote education for all. 
<H5>  Security for the People </H5>
  The coalition promises to counter organized crime in its

  The coalition promises to earmark funding for environmental 
rescue projects, financially support the NGO's, promulgate a 
general law on the environment, and include environmental 
education in the national educational system. It also promises

rest of Latin America and the Caribbean nations. 
  It also promises to gradually open Salvadoran markets, to 
strengthen domestic industry, and to revitalize the country's 
participation in international forums such as the UN and OAS. 
It also vows to review past efforts to enable the consultative 
group created by the Chapultepec Accords to increase its 
cooperation in rebuilding the nation. 
  It promises to implement a policy to defend Salvadoran 
residents in territories transferred to Honduras, to struggle 
against drug trafficking, to professionalize the diplomatic 
corps, and to seek better conditions for negotiations with the 
North.

  [Text] San Salvador, 16 Mar (DPA) -- The Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal, the foremost electoral body, has announced that the 
Salvadoran Army will be confined to its barracks during the 
general elections on Sunday, 20 March. 
  The National Civilian Police (PNC) and the National Police, 
which is currently being phased out, will provide security for 
the elections, which are scheduled to begin at 0700 and end at 
1700. 
  PNC Director Jose Maria Monterrey said some 4,000 policemen 
will guard the national polling places in a joint effort with 
the National Police. The PNC, a new corps that emerged as a 
result of the 1992 peace agreements ending a 12-year war, 
currently covers only seven of the country's 14 departments. 
The PNC will be at the service of the TSE in all remote regions 
and will be equipped with modern radio equipment, Monterrey 
announced. 
  For his part, National Police Director Samuel Dolores 
Cuellar 
said that for the last time -- since it is supposed to be phased 
out in September -- the National Police will have 4,193 
policemen posted at 148 polling places throughout the country. 
  The police chief added that the National Police will provide 
protection in the capital and in the principal cities of Santa 
Ana, San Miguel, Ahuachapan, Sonsonate, and La Libertad 
Departments. 
  The Armed Forces will have the sole duty of assisting the 
TSE 
in the immediate transfer of vote count certificates or election 
officials aboard helicopters. Party officials and observers 
will always be present at such times. 
  For their part, the political parties, with the 
participation 
of the UN Observers for El Salvador (Onusal), have signed 
documents and commitments wherein they appeal to their party 
rank and file to observe the necessary prudence and to avoid 
acts of violence as electoral tension increases. 
  Six parties and a three-party alliance will participate in 
the presidential elections. The alliance, however, will not 
participate as such in the legislative and municipal elections. 
  The elections are for the presidency of the Republic, 84 
deputy seats, and municipal councilmen positions in 262 
municipalities. 
  The parties with the best chances are the ruling Nationalist 
Republican Alliance (ARENA), the leftist presidential coalition 
[Democratic Convergence-Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front-National Revolutionary Movement Coalition] and Christian 
Democracy, which has been relegated to third place. 
  Other rightist parties are the National Coalition (PCN), the 
Authentic Christian Movement (MAC), the Unity Movement, and the 
National Solidarity Movement, all of which have slim chances.

<F P=106> [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] President Luis 
Arturo Zaldiva has said everything is ready for the 20 March 
elections. He added that shortcomings in the issuance of voter 
registration cards have been overcome and that the nationwide 
distribution of electoral materials is already under way. 
  [Begin recording] [Zaldivar] As of midnight last night, more 
than 800,000 voter registration cards had been issued; in other 
words, we exceeded the goal we set for ourselves. This is very 
satisfying for the TSE and its staff. We commend those voters 
who came to the TSE offices to obtain voter registration cards. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Could you give us an estimate? 
  [Zaldivar] Of the cards issued? Remember, registration ended 
at midnight last night. We still do not have exact figures, but 
I can tell you that we exceeded 800,000 cards. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] take the election materials to 
all places in the country? 
  [Zaldivar] The nationwide delivery of election materials 
began yesterday. They will arrive at departmental and municipal 
electoral boards, and as the law stipulates, and they will 
eventually arrive at the voting table boards. [end recording] 
  Zaldivar also talked about the role of the international 
observers who are already in El Salvador to verify the outcome 
of the elections. 
  [Begin recording] [Zaldivar] There are more than 3,000 
observers. We have (?registered) more than 2,000 visiting 
observers. Also, there are 900 UN observers and 25 TSE special 
guests who are members of the Inter-American Union of Electoral 
Organizations. 
  [Reporter] When will the results be released? 
  [Zaldivar] The vote count will include two parts -- a 
preliminary count and a final count. At the very latest, the 
final count should begin 48 hours after the polls close. During 
this process, the law requires us to report partial results. 
This is why we created the National Vote Counting Center, where 
we will hold a [word indistinct] involving the media to allow 
them to inform the nation and the world about the election 
results as they become available. These results will be based 
on data we collect through the logistical plan we devised -- a 
plan that involves the counting of votes and the dissemination 
of the results. [end recording] 
  International observers will be assigned throughout the 
country to cover all municipalities. The full authority of the 
Salvadoran state will be at stake in the 20 March elections.

  [Text] San Salvador, 17 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- The secretaries 
general of nine political parties that will participate in 
Sunday's general elections in El Salvador today signed a new 
pledge to maintain "judiciousness and peace" on election day. 
The document was signed at the Onusal [UN Observers for El 
Salvador] headquarters, and President Alfredo Cristiani was the 
"honorary witness." 
  The declaration says: "Convinced of the historical 
importance" of Sunday's elections, "we ratify our firm 
determination to cooperate and guarantee that these elections 
are held in an atmosphere of tranquillity, safety, and complete 
freedom." 
  The political leaders, who included members of the most 
conservative right-wing group of the old FMLN [Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front] guerrilla groups, pledged to urge 
their party members and sympathizers to abstain from all acts of 
intimidation, coercion, pressure, or fraud, and from provoking 
the contenders. 
  In addition, they pledged to punctually open the polling 
places, scheduled for 0700 (1300 GMT), and guarantee that 
functions at the polling places be carried out only by duly 
accredited members of the Voting Table Boards. 
  The Salvadoran party leaders pledged to abide by the legal 
provisions for the elections, to guarantee that the polling 
places will close at 1700 (2300 GMT), and to maintain "order" 
during the vote-counting process. Likewise, they asked the 
Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) to enforce the Electoral Code 
provision concerning the ban on military in active service and 
the police, as well as pastors and religious leaders, engaging 
in partisan publicity. "Our large-scale and peaceful 
participation in the elections will be the best example of the 
Salvadoran people's civic mindedness and their determination to 
build the democratic, modern, just, and participatory nation we 
all hope for," the document states. 
  Between 2.3 million and 2.4 million Salvadorans will elect 
the president and vice president of the Republic, 84 Legislative 
Assembly deputies, 20 Central American Parliament deputies, and 
262 mayors throughout the country. 
  The declaration was signed by Armando Calderon Sol, of the 
ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena); Shafik Handal, 
of the FMLN; Victor Valle, of the National Revolutionary 
Movement; and Ciro Cruz Zepeda, of the National Conciliation 
Party (PCN). The document was also signed by Aronette Diaz, of 
Democratic Convergence; Guillermo Guevara, of the Authentic 
Christian Party (MAC); Edgardo Rodriguez, of the National 
Solidarity Movement (MSN); Jorge Martinez, of the Unity Movement 
(MU); and Antonio Morales, of the Christian Democratic Party 
(PDC). Armando Calderon Sol, Edgardo Rodriguez, and Jorge 
Martinez are also candidates for the Presidency of the Republic.

  [Editorial Report] San Pedro Sula TIEMPO in Spanish on 10 
March, page 5, reports that on 9 March after meeting with the 
Honduran Exporters Association, Hugo Noe Pino, president of the 
Central Bank of Honduras, said the reactivation of public 
investment will decrease this year. Noe Pino said this will be a 
difficult year for Hondurans because of the high fiscal deficit 
left by the previous government. Noe Pino said it will also be 
difficult because price freezes will be lifted and fluctuations 
are expected in the exchange rate. Noe Pino added, however, that 
the family basket tax will not increase. An tax increase on 
luxury items is being analyzed, he noted.

  [Excerpt] Gregoire Eugene, spokesman for the coordinating 
committee of the parties and groups hostile to President 
Aristide, called on 17 March for a general mobilization of the 
masses to cope with the embargo and fill the institutional 
vacuum created by the exile of President Aristide and the 
resignation of Prime Minister Robert Malval. This mobilization 
may take the form of a people's demonstration within the next 
few days, according to Eugene, who plans to call on other 
political groupings to reinforce the defensive line. In his 
opinion, we are in complete anarchy, and without the courage of 
the Haitian people the country would sink as conditions coalesce 
into social explosion. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Anti-Aristide opposition is mobilizing and calling 
on the Army to support a solution to the crisis. The 
coordination committee of the parties hostile to President 
Aristide has decided to go on the offensive to try to fill the 
institutional vacuum. Mobilization is the political fuel the 
committee intends to use to achieve this goal. During its first 
contact with the press on 16 March, this assembly of parties, 
including MDN [Mobilization for National Development] and FRAPH 
[Revolutionary Front for Haitain Advancement and Progress], 
terms the absence of a leader in the executive anarchy. The 
committee's president says this political vacuum can provoke the 
explosion of a social bomb in the country. Attorney Gregoire 
Eugene states that the problem of institutional vacuum must be 
solved in any case: 
  [Begin Eugene recording] We are going to get involved 
immediately because there is danger in the house. It is urgent. 
The situation can no longer hold. We are going to launch the 
great offensive and impose on whomever it may concern the 
obligation of filling Haiti's institutional vacuum, allowing the 
country to emerge from its crisis. I am not saying that in 
filling this vacuum, we are going to solve all the problems, but 
at least something will be done; there will at least be an 
organization to help the country emerge from its deadlock. [end 
recording] 
  The coordination committee intends to interact with other 
political forces in an effort to devise a unified strategy for 
facing the power vacuum that has existed since Malval's 
resignation. Questioned on the attitude of the international 
community toward such an initiative, Eugene asserts that in case 
of rejection of their solution by the foreigners, Haitians will 
have to learn to manage the embargo: 
  [Begin Eugene recording] If the international community 
agrees with our decision not to remain in this state of anarchy 
and decides to consider the ambient misery, that is fine. If it 
is deaf and uneasy, then the only answer is for us to find ways 
to manage the embargo. That is, unfortunately, what we have not 
learned to do. It would be necessary that after this embargo, 
after the experience that we will have faced, we could say 
blessed be my accounts. [as heard] [end recording] 
  It should be noted that during this news conference, the 
coordination committee, following the forum at the Visa Lodge, 
considered the legislators' plan doomed to failure.

  [Text] The office of Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul is 
pleased to publish -- as promised -- the report on expenses 
incurred on the occasion of the symbolic Save Honor carnival of 
1994. In a press release dated 14 March, the mayor's office, 
which had just paid three months' back wages to the directors 
and teachers of the communal schools, the employees of the 
communal home, and some employees of the Port-au-Prince City 
Hall, deplores the fact that Deputy Mayor Joseph Gerald Salomon 
has set himself to prevent the refuse collection workers and the 
majority of City Hall employees from receiving their paychecks, 
which have been available for over one month. 
  This press release says the office of Mayor Paul is now 
working to set up the "Port-au-Prince is struggling" program, 
the purpose of which is to help improve the living conditions of 
the population. As a sign of its efforts to restore the proper 
functioning of the city administration and to allow the 
employees to receive their wages, the office of the mayor takes 
this opportunity to publish a letter which Mayor Evans Paul sent 
to Deputy Mayor Joseph Gerald Salomon and which still has not 
been answered. 
  The dramatic situation of the city, which the population 
gave 
us the responsibility of managing, compels me to write you this 
letter so as to reach the compromise essential to the rescue of 
the municipal institution of our capital, writes Evans Paul to 
Joseph Gerald Salmon. I invite you to regain your self-control 
and to comply with the norms and principles that you swore to 
respect on 17 January 1991 when we were installed at the Court 
House, Paul adds. Beyond our differences and divergences are the 
fundamental interests of Port-au-Prince society. We have nothing 
to win, collectively or individually, in this anarchical 
situation of an administration that does not offer any services 
to the community. Within the framework of the "Port-au-Prince is 
struggling" program, I am ready to meet with you -- as a member 
of the cartel over which I have an electoral mandate to preside 
-- in order to discuss solutions relating to the problem, writes 
Evans Paul. 
  I hope you will understand the logic of my steps aimed at 
normalizing and reinforcing the institutional capability of the 
city administration to improve the awful conditions of the 
Port-au-Prince populace. 
  This press release is signed by Evans Paul, president of the 
Port-au-Prince Municipal Council.

  [Excerpt] Assistant Mayor [Joseph] Gerald Salomon says he 
is ready to meet with Mayor Evans Paul provided that the press 
is present. Salomon, who has been accused of hindering the 
payment of Port-au-Prince City Hall employees, sends the ball 
into the court of Evans Paul. The assistant mayor of the capital 
accuses Paul of trying to impose suffering on the employees. 
  [Begin recording] [Salomon] ...in front of the press, on 
television. I am ready to meet with the mayor to discuss these 
problems because it is time that the public be made aware of 
what is going on within the administration. 
  "The payroll has been prepared so that the refuse collection 
employees can be paid for one month. The money has remained in 
the mayor's hands. Until now, employees have been coming here 
everyday and none of them has received his salary. Payroll has 
been prepared for the communal home, but very few of those 
people have received their salaries. Payroll has been prepared 
so the mayors can be paid. No mayor has received his salary, 
except for him [Evans Paul]. Payroll has been prepared for the 
mortuary service. Until now, the people have been burying the 
dead every afternoon for 12 months. 
  "The money has been in the mayor's hands for one month. The 
money left the Supreme Audit Court on 8 February. At this time, 
City Hall has over 4 million gourdes in the bank. Nobody has 
received any salary except the mayor and his driver. 
  [Unidentified journalist] "You said you are ready to sit 
face-to-face with Mayor Evans Paul, but in the open, in 
public...." 
  [Salomon, interrupting] ...in public so he can provide 
explanations regarding his infamies. People's money has been in 
his hands for one month. He has not paid them. This is sad. One 
cannot make people suffer like that. 
  [Journalist] "So, if I understand properly, you are not 
responsible for what is going on today in City Hall?" 
  [Salomon] I am not. I called representatives of the mayor on 
several occasions, [asking them] to come here. If paychecks are 
available, they must find a way to pay the people. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] The UN/OAS international civilian mission has 
publicly noted the increase in violence in Port-au-Prince over 
the past few days. The mission, which resumed its activities on 
31 January, is currently investigating 21 cases of extrajudicial 
executions and of suspicious deaths that occurred in the capital 
during the first 15 days of March. Sixteen of those victims were 
from the slum neighborhood of Cite Soleil. The victims include a 
student, Mesilia Mesadieux, who was murdered in Delmas 19, and 
Dady Pierre, who was killed in Cite Soleil. In the latter case, 
the mission quotes witnesses who saw military personnel and two 
armed civilians. 
  Furthermore, the mission counted 50 cases of murder between 
31 January and 28 February. The victims include 12 members of 
grassroots organizations and an Army officer killed in 
Carrefour-Feuilles. 
  In concluding its report, the UN/OAS international civilian 
mission condemned the growing number of extrajudicial executions 
and suspicious deaths, and has asked the Haitian Armed Forces to 
take measures to end this cycle of violence. The assessment 
made by the Port-au-Prince police should also be pointed out: 
883 people were arrested for various reasons during the month of 
February. Two hundred thirteen of the detained were released, 
and 424 were referred to the court.

  [Text] Opening a meeting on measures to promote confidence 
and security mechanisms, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said 
military cooperation is essential for a true continental 
integration. The OAS-sponsored meeting opened in Buenos Aires 
yesterday, 
  Chatting informally, the participants were more emphatic 
than 
Di Tella. They stated that "every time the OAS discusses the 
security issue, the Armed Forces of member countries have been 
systematically excluded. It is time the military component of 
the policies of member countries was considered as a factor in 
the OAS assessments." 
  Di Tella addressed an auditorium in which uniformed members 
of the Armed Forces of the OAS member countries mingled with 
suited diplomats. He stated: "Until we can impose a new pace in 
the military field, the integration process lacks an 
indispensable component for its consolidation." 
  The Argentine foreign minister said: "It is time to combine 
our political, economic, and social progress with the military 
aspect." 
  He said this should be based on the following essential 
premises: Defining military doctrines based on legitimate 
defense needs; and "clarity" through communication, information, 
observation, verification, and the maintenance of a subregional 
military balance that will finally lead to a "functional 
integration." 
  This change of attitude by OAS member countries comes just 
as 
the United States is exerting pressure on the Latin American 
military to engage directly in the struggle against trafficking. 
  This contradicts an ancient and deep-rooted lack of 
confidence within OAS member countries: The Armed Forces are 
considered latent coupist elements -- following the experience 
of decades -- against democratic governments. 
  As for the possible objectives of the meeting, Di Tella said 
that the OAS can become "a natural forum for discussion, 
agreement, and implementation of hemispheric decisions on 
security issues." There is also "the possibility of 
establishing a regional center to prevent and handle conflicts 
and controversies." 
  Hernan Patino Mayer -- the Argentine ambassador to the OAS, 
who is one of the main promoters of the meeting -- asserted that 
the Armed Forces of the region "have a special role to play in 
this continental integration process."

  [Text] Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada on 16 
March ratified in Buenos Aires his country's desire to join the 
Common Market of the South [Mercosur], which includes Argentina, 
Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay. The Bolivian president is here 
on an official visit, and during his first meeting with Carlos 
Menem he discussed the signing of several bilateral agreements. 
He also began discussions to obtain a measure of exception that 
will allow Bolivians who reside here to obtain their residence 
documents. 
  "For Bolivians, Argentina is practically their second 
fatherland. Thousands of Bolivians reside in Buenos Aires and 
throughout Argentina and contribute toward this country with 
their work," Sanchez de Losada said on his arrival in the 
country. 
  Regarding the possibility of joining Mercosur, the Bolivian 
president said: "I have very much wanted to approach Mercosur 
because we are a part of the Pacific's Amazon Basin, but we also 
belong to the River Plate Basin." But a diplomatic source 
indicated that the possibility is very remote and could only 
happen within the framework of a Brazilian initiative to create 
a giant South American common market. 
  Moreover, the agenda's main topic is the signing of an 
agreement that will permit the free exchange of gas, oil, and 
their by-products with an eye on bilateral integration in the 
energy sector. Argentine credits for the prevention of cholera 
in border areas is also an agenda topic.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 16 Mar (NA) -- UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali said today that the decision to send a 
peacekeeping force to Bosnia "is the exclusive responsibility of 
the Argentine Government." He also categorically denied that he 
had "demanded financial support" from the Carlos Menem 
administration. 
  In a news conference held at the UN office in the Recoleta 
Cultural Center in this capital, Butrus Butrus-Ghali said that 
the decision to send a unit of Blue Helmets to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina "must be made by the Argentine Government." 
  The UN secretary general clarified this issue after the 
Argentine Government decision to accept a UN request to 
contribute 150 soldiers to the hottest spot in the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  He said: "The United Nations requests the troops, and we 
specify the mission to every state member, but each government 
defines the type of aid it can provide. In some cases it can 
contribute personnel, and in other cases weapons. The aid will 
always be welcome." 
  In this regard he said the United Nations "can act as 
mediator" among the states that intend to provide troops, 
weapons, or transportation means. He made it clear that 
"pressure will never be exerted on a government to make a 
contribution" of this kind. 
  Butrus-Ghali also pointed out that "no request for money was 
made to Argentina," thus rejecting a report indicating that the 
United Nations had requested from the government a contribution 
of $10 million for financing various peacekeeping missions 
around the world." 
  He said: "Argentina has paid its UN dues. It is the United 
Nations that owes money to Argentina. But the problem is that 
the United Nations is going through a financial crisis in 
carrying out missions of this type and with the characteristics 
it considers necessary." 
  He also indicated that states "must be convinced" to pay 
their dues "for the symbolic value, among other things, of 
cooperating to preserve peace among members." 
  Butrus-Ghali said the United Nations "is an instrument at 
the 
service of the state members." He added: "No country finds 
military intervention in another country acceptable, unless it 
is coordinated by the United Nations." 
  Butrus-Ghali also said that it had been decided to increase 
the number of Security Council members based on the hundreds of 
letters sent by UN members. 
  He said: "The majority are in favor of reforming the 
Security Council created in 1945, when there were only 50 
members. We now have 184 countries, and it is therefore 
necessary to have new members on the council." 
  He believes the number of countries making up the Security 
Council "will be increased to 18 or 19 members," although he 
explained that it would be impossible for the change to be made 
next year, when the United Nations will celebrate its 50th 
anniversary. 
  He said the main current problems are "the ethnic wars" 
within states, which he labeled micronationalisms 
[micronacionalismos]. He said the UN mission "is to reconcile 
the different positions." 
  He added: "UN actions are no longer restricted to keeping 
the peace. It has to demobilize armies that are not linked to a 
peace negotiating process, and must also rebuild bridges, roads, 
hospitals, and schools after the war is over."

  [Text] Argentine pharmaceutical industrialists argue that 
U.S. laboratories must accept GATT agreements recognizing the 
need for patents, but also contemplating a series of licenses 
and exceptions to exclusivity. 
  What follows is a conversation between CLARIN and CILFA 
[Argentine Pharmaceutical Laboratories Industrial Center] 
Director Pablo Challu, former secretary of commerce in the 
Carlos Menem administration. 
  [CLARIN] In view of the latest U.S. pressures, will CILFA 
continue to oppose the patents law, or will it advocate a 
negotiated solution? 
  [Challu] The climate for a patents law has changed 
dramatically, because at the end of 1993 Argentina, the United 
States, and other countries signed the GATT agreement which 
includes a chapter dedicated to pharmaceutical patents. 
Argentina will honor and fulfill that international agreement, 
as it should, and will have a patents law by the end of 1994. 
  [CLARIN] We no longer have any conflict, then. 
  [Challu] It is not that simple. We (CILFA) ask countries 
that have signed the agreement -- and among them the United 
States and its laboratories -- to respect the agreement. 
  [CLARIN] You want Argentine laboratories' acquired rights 
recognized? 
  [Challu] The agreement recognizes the exclusive rights of 
the 
laboratory that develops a drug. We accept this. The agreement 
also establishes a series of exceptions and the possibility of 
granting licenses. This provision will guarantee, through the 
appropriate legislation, the existence of sufficient competition 
in the market. The agreement also establishes a transition of 
11 years for developing countries before the full implementation 
of the measure. This is natural, because developing countries 
were granted a period of transition of between 30 to 40 years to 
end their agricultural subsidies. 
  [CLARIN] Which is the main hurdle blocking a solution to 
this 
conflict? 
  [Challu] The problem is that we accept the GATT agreement, 
with all its consequences, but foreign laboratories do not 
understand it that way. That is the problem. There is haste, 
and we suffer pressures. Why do they refuse to wait until the 
end of the year, and want a law now? Because they have the 
possibility of threatening us with unilateral economic 
sanctions. At the end of the year, when all congresses in the 
world approve a similar law, the possibility of imposing 
economic sanctions will end. 
  [CLARIN] Is one of the sanctions the refusal to let 
Argentina 
join NAFTA? 
  [Challu] We understand it to be an unacceptable argument. It 
would be reasonable to expect concessions in exchange for 
something else within NAFTA. But it would be absurd to accept 
what they are requesting without offering anything in exchange. 
  [CLARIN] Will you continue to work on the issue at 
Government 
House and in Congress? Six months ago you met with the 
president. 
  [Challu] They heard our arguments carefully. But now things 
have changed, because we signed the GATT agreement. This is why 
we are today telling the United States and foreign laboratories, 
which are always telling us to continue on the legal path, that 
today the legal path is to respect GATT. 
  [CLARIN] Is it necessary to introduce changes into the draft 
bill now in Congress in order to accommodate the GATT principles? 
  [Challu] We must introduce a series of changes in the bill 
to 
include the transition period and the flexibility to grant 
licenses. 
  [CLARIN] What will happen if Congress approves a law that 
meets all U.S. requirements? 
  [Challu] Consumers will foot the bill. Medicine prices will 
increase between 250 and 300 percent, not in the long term but 
immediately, as happened in Italy when a patents law was 
approved. Besides, the bill will affect the balance of payments, 
because we will have to pay some $500 million annually to the 
United States over patents, instead of the $30 million we 
currently pay. Besides, at this time we have a balance of trade 
deficit of $3 billion with the United States.

  [Text] San Miguel de Tucuman, 17 Mar (NA) -- At 1200 today, 
nearly 200 workers from the La Florida Sugar Mill invaded the 
Tucuman Congress building and destroyed a large portion of its 
facilities. 
  After attempting in vain to be received by the congressmen 
who were present in the building, the demonstrators invaded the 
provincial Congress and destroyed the glass windows on the 
ground floor, as well as several offices. 
  After the incidents, the workers went to Independence 
Square, 
in front of Government House, where they are still waiting for a 
meeting with Tucuman Governor Ramon Ortega to take stock of the 
situation. 
  The workers' protest demonstration was staged within the 
framework of those that began 15 days ago after news was 
published that the sugar mill had gone bankrupt. 
  Governor Ortega said he would not meet with "anyone who has 
chosen to adopt violent methods." 
  Ortega is holding a meeting with the representatives of the 
Alcofin company, which will be in charge of exploiting the sugar 
mill from now on. 
  The congressmen were surprised at the police delay in 
containing the demonstrators. The police did not arrive at the 
Congress building until the demonstrators were already leaving, 
and did not arrest anyone. 
  The workers' version of the incident has it that "the 
attacks 
began from inside the Congress building," from where the first 
stones and firecrackers were hurled. 
  Some Congress employees were injured trying to leave the 
area. 
  Acting Congress President Christian Saracho held Miguel 
Brito, secretary general of the local General Confederation of 
Labor office, as one of those responsible for the incidents.

  [Text] President Carlos Menem has agreed to pay an 
extensive visit to the PRC, as he had to cut his last visit to 
that country short after a couple of days due to domestic 
problems. The date for this state visit has not yet been 
established. Menem extended this promise to PRC Deputy Foreign 
Minister Liu Huaqiu during a meeting they had yesterday on the 
occasion of the latter's visit to Argentina. 
  According to the Foreign Ministry's tentative program, Menem 
will travel to the PRC this year as part of a tour that would 
also include the ROK. Sources close to the Foreign Ministry 
told CLARIN that a final confirmation of this trip is still 
pending. 
  Liu, a career diplomat specialized in Latin American 
affairs, 
was accompanied to the meeting with Menem by PRC Ambassador to 
Argentina Tang Yonggui and Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister 
Fernando Petrella, among other officials.

<F P=106> [Article by Nancy Pazos: "An Agitated Government Cabinet </F>
Meeting"] 
  [Text] During a lively cabinet meeting Domingo Cavallo 
complained about the lack of solidarity shown by the Executive 
and Legislative branches in defending the economic model. 
President Menem interrupted to tell him that he himself had 
supported it. Saul Bouer, who was seated directly opposite 
Cavallo, ended his rift with the economy minister. 
  Domingo Cavallo waited for the right moment. When Armando 
Caro Figueroa finished his weekly defense of more flexible labor 
laws, the economy minister asked for the floor: "I am going to 
raise a point of privilege," he said, unexpectedly recalling his 
brief time in the legislature. Everyone realized that this 
marked the beginning of what they were all waiting for: the last 
round in the fight between Cavallo and Buenos Aires Mayor Saul 
Bouer. 
  The justification for his solemn introduction, which was 
unlike the language typical of cabinet meetings, was not long in 
coming. Cavallo complained officially about the "lack of 
solidarity of the Executive and Legislative" branches with him 
and his efforts in light of developments over the past few days 
(read: his defense of the automotive industry against the 
onslaught of the DGI [General Directorate of Taxation]), the 
battle with Saul Bouer and Miguel Angel Broda, and the incident 
with federal Judge Roberto Marquevich, among others. 
  This was actually the conclusion that Cavallo drew after a 
detailed rundown of the attacks that he said he had suffered for 
the past two weeks. To show that he was not talking about 
rumors, the minister had done his homework and brought a folder 
containing clippings of all the newspaper articles about him 
during this time into the Situation Room of the Government 
Palace. 
<H5>  Menem Speaks Out </H5>
  "Except for the president, who clearly backed me, no one 
here 
spoke up to defend me. The Executive and Legislative branches 
showed a lack of solidarity with me," Cavallo said, reducing the 
room to an uncommon silence. A reply came from the only person 
around the table who was not holding his breath. 
  "Mr. Minister, do you know what the Executive Branch is?" 
asked Carlos Menem, as the other cabinet ministers looked on as 
mere spectators. 
  "Because in case you do not, Mr. Minister, I am the 
Executive 
Branch. And I defended you not only this morning but also since 
I was on my trip through Colombia. So, the only thing that ought 
to concern you is what I say; the others are just incidental 
colleagues. Moreover, what I say I say on my behalf and on 
behalf of my ministers...." 
  Hugo Anzorreguy's departure to answer an urgent call 
succeeded in tempering the chill that had descended on the room. 
By then the president's outburst had given Jorge Matzkin the 
courage to defend the other branch that Cavallo had attacked, 
the Legislature. 
  "There is a confusion of terms here," began the head of the 
Justicialist bloc in the Chamber of Deputies. "The minister has 
repeatedly gotten our political solidarity; but we Peronists owe 
Bouer our friendship as well, and here we are talking about a 
different kind of solidarity...." 
  Matzkin avoided direct reference to the heart of the matter: 
Peronism stands behind Cavallo's efforts but defends the 
Justicialists whom the minister is attacking. It was a way of 
excluding Cavallo from the Justicialist "space" by seeking to 
confirm a political identity. 
  Menem then resorted to an almost paternal tone to illustrate 
his remarks and put an end to the issue: "Don't forget," he 
said, looking at all times into Cavallo's blue eyes, "that you 
have to be on good terms with God; the angels are always 
around..." according to the account of someone at the meeting. 
  The president was thus trying to put an end to the episode 
that began last week when the former untouchables broke into the 
Sevel agencies. 
  The minister gave an extremely personal analysis of the 
situation yesterday: "The fact is that if I do not come out and 
defend the model, I do not know who will..." he complained from 
his chair, directly opposite Bouer's, in justifying his verbal 
excesses. 
  The mayor interrupted the minister's monologue only to tell 
his colleagues that the incident that had set them at odds 
(Cavallo accused him of having leaked the news that led to the 
run on the peso in 1991) was now "completely behind them." 
  "We have already spoken in private, and there is nothing 
else 
to clarify," Bouer said 48 hours after his last attempt to 
resign. Several cabinet members remarked afterwards that 
yesterday Cavallo had made every possible "gesture" towards the 
mayor. He even apologized over the phone to Bouer's wife and 
daughter, who were the ones most interested in seeing the mayor 
return to private life. 
<H5>  Cavallo Attacks </H5>
  Cavallo had begun his outburst by reading the main remarks 
that Judge Roberto Marquevich had made about him (calling him 
"raving" and authoritarian, among other things) in the newspaper 
interview that appeared on Wednesday. 
  Newspaper clipping in hand, Cavallo received his first show 
of solidarity. Maria Julia Alsogaray, the secretary of the 
environment, recalled other "inappropriate" remarks by the San 
Isidro federal judge. Marquevich, who is now investigating 
Francisco Macri for tax evasion, was the one who sent another 
prominent businessmen, Roberto Constantini, to jail for an 
environmental crime. Again according to Maria Julia, the judge 
had also attempted to implicate her in the case. 
  But Cavallo was not satisfied with talking just about 
Marquevich. He also complained about Alberto Piotti, the former 
judge who became a pro-Menem deputy and is now the brand-new 
Buenos Aires security secretary. Piotti, a member of the "Rating 
Group" (the band of deputies who wander around the mass media 
defending Menem's policies), had criticized Cavallo. 
  Menem did not miss his chance to show, at little cost, how 
far his solidarity with his minister goes. He looked around him 
and saw Munir Menem, his brother, chief of presidential advisers 
and the virtual "owner" of the seats at "Tango 01." The 
president immediately ordered him to exclude Piotti from the 
presidential party that will be traveling to Spain. 
  An hour after the meeting ended, the rumors about the 
short-circuit between Cavallo and the Executive Branch reached 
the financial district. But the sharp fall in the stock market 
lasted only 45 minutes. Calm then returned to nervous offices in 
the financial district and the government.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Mar (NA) -- In various operations 
conducted in the federal capital and in greater Buenos Aires, 
the police have seized nearly 200 kg of cocaine and arrested 
over 25 people. This has been the hardest blow dealt to drug 
trafficking this year. 
  Judge Juan Jose Galeano headed an operation conducted in 
Lomas de Zamora, Buenos Aires, during which police found more 
than 50 kg of cocaine that had been "artistically" hidden inside 
five wooden doors that had been carefully constructed for this 
illegal act. 
  This operation led the Federal Police to raid the "Buenos 
Aires" warehouse in the Pompeya district, where they found 15 
similar doors with dozens of bricks of cocaine inside. 
  According to Police Inspector Norberto Ruiz, who was in 
charge of the operation, the "merchandise" had been brought from 
Jujuy in a station wagon belonging to the freight company "La 
Sevillanita." 
  Ruiz reported that neither those responsible for the 
warehouse nor the freight company managers were apparently 
involved in smuggling the drugs. 
  The operation was the fruit of "four months of 
investigations," Ruiz pointed out. He added that the agents 
assigned to the operation hadn't slept for 48 hours. 
  According to reports the merchandise kept at the "Buenos 
Aires Warehouse" was to have been picked up by a drug trafficker 
identified as Adrian Flores. This name, however, could be false. 
  Judge Galeano said he was "very satisfied" with the results 
of the investigation, and praised the policemen's performance in 
helping solve the case. 
  When the policemen took apart the doors, they realized that 
8 
kg of highly pure cocaine were hidden inside each door, though 
some doors were heavier than others. 
  The court officials pointed out that more raids and arrests 
will result from the operation, because the gang probably has 
connections in Jujuy Province and in other regions of the 
country.

  [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso said 
today that the salary increase approved by deputies for 
themselves is unforgivable. The increase was one of the issues 
discussed by Cardoso with the representative of Brazil's 
creditor banks in New York today. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Paulo Henrique Amorim] After the 
meeting, Bill Rhodes, the banks' representative, said that 
tomorrow afternoon he will send a document to all creditor banks 
recommending the approval of the Brazilian proposal to replace 
the IMF loan with U.S. Government certificates purchased by the 
Brazilian Government. Bill Rhodes believes the fact that Brazil 
has not obtained a loan yet from the IMF will not prevent the 
agreement with Brazil from being signed as scheduled on 15 
April. Minister Cardoso said Brazil has enough exchange reserves 
to sign an agreement with the banks without problems. I asked 
Bill Rhodes if he believes Brazil will be able to maintain a 
balanced budget even after the Chamber of Deputies approved a 
salary increase for deputies. Rhodes said he does not discuss 
Brazilian domestic issues but believes Minister Cardoso will 
make the economic plan be fulfilled. I asked the same question 
to Minister Cardoso. 
  [Cardoso] I believe the Senate will have the political 
knowledge to understand the current situation and correct what I 
find unforgivable: the increase approved at a time when Brazil 
needs austerity, when we are asking not to increase workers' 
salaries in general. There is no justification for the deputies 
to approve a salary increase for themselves, and there would not 
be any justification for the Senate to do the same either. [end

  [Text] Brasilia -- PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] 
President Tasso Jereissati admits that Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso will not leave the government to run in the 
presidential elections. This means that the political forces 
that support the government -- the PSDB and the PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party] members who do not follow Orestes 
Quercia -- are again considering the candidacy of Deputy Antonio 
Britto (PMDB-RS [Rio Grande do Sul]), who is campaigning to run 
for governor of Rio Grande do Sul State. 
  Following the PMDB executive board meeting that decided to 
call the party political council to discuss the impasse created 
by Quercia's candidacy, PMDB President Deputy Luiz Henrique 
admitted he is receiving strong pressure from the presidents of 
regional PMDB offices to endorse Britto's candidacy for 
president of the Republic. 
  Jereissati confirmed a report published by O GLOBO stating 
that the two parties' leaders recently have established contacts 
to support Britto. Such efforts, however, were defeated by the 
launching of Quercia's candidacy, Jereissati said. 
  "There was a tacit agreement that the PMDB would support 
Fernando Henrique and that the PSDB would support Britto. There 
still exists the possibility to resume contacts and that the 
PSDB will support Britto," Jereissati said. 
  The PSDB president -- whose party stems from a split over 
Quercia's leadership of the PMDB -- does not even consider 
discussing Quercia's estrangement from the alliance because it 
will be a natural consequence of the official launching of 
Britto's candidacy. 
  "Britto will become a candidate only if the PMDB solves the 
problem of Quercia's candidacy. That seems to be the only 
obstacle. Once it is solved, we will be able to hold concrete 
talks about an alliance," Jereissati said. 
  Just like the PSDB president, most PSDB congressmen in 
Brasilia began to have doubts about Fernando Henrique's 
candidacy. Such doubts were expressed during Cardoso's 48-hour 
trip to the United States, during which he put in second place 
the subject of the scope of an alliance that could support him. 
First place, for him, was the political appropriateness of 
leaving his post at such an essential moment for the economic 
stabilization program. 
  The PMDB has internally resumed the discussion about 
Britto's 
candidacy independently of eventual PSDB support. Quercia 
followers who consider his candidacy suicidal are considering 
alternatives like Goias Governor Iris Rezende or former 
President Jose Sarney.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bahia State Governor Antonio Carlos </F>
Magalhaes by Cristiana Lobo; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Lobo] Is [Foreign Minister] Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso the PFL [Liberal Front Party] candidate? 
  [Magalhaes] No. The PFL has a natural candidate, a party 
candidate. I am that candidate. As I intend to resign on 30 
March, I could tour Brazil, boost my image, and become a strong 
candidate. But this is not what I am going to do. I want to 
become senator for Bahia State. I believe the political forces 
must be able to find a common candidate to face the critical 
situation that the country is experiencing. If possible we will 
select a common candidate. It could be Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso, some other member of his party, or a candidate from 
another party. There are some very good names. 
  [Lobo] Who? 
  [Magalhaes] It may be someone from the PP [Popular Party] or 
the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]. Citing names is always 
unpleasant because no one likes to be excluded. Everyone 
believes that he is capable of resolving the country's problems. 
This is why I will not cite names. Some are known to the 
public, others will have to campaign to become known by the 
public... 
  [Lobo] The PFL was initially critical following the launch 
of 
the economic plan. What has now changed: the plan or the PFL? 
  [Magalhaes] The PFL did not change nor is the plan 
successful. One thing is certain: The PFL supported all the 
measures submitted by Itamar [Franco's] government to save 
Brazil. But, this has not happened. It is not the fault of the 
PFL that the plan will not succeed. Leaving the plan aside, the 
PFL believes Cardoso has aptitude. But he is not the only one 
who has the necessary aptitude to resolve Brazil's problems. 
Like Cardoso, there are others who can make Brazil grow again. 
Brazil needs an administrator. It is a question of observing 
who is administering his state appropriately in order to choose 
a good presidential candidate. 
  [Lobo] Is the PFL making any demands over joining a 
coalition? 
  [Magalhaes] The PFL could make demands, it even has the 
right 
to make them. But it's strength lies in the fact that it wants 
the basic points of its program to be studied by associates of 
an alliance. These points must be taken seriously because they 
are very important. We are convinced that no one can govern 
Brazil well without adopting the basic points of our program, 
because they are the hallmarks of a candidate that wants to save 
Brazil and get it out of the chaos. To have political interests 
is natural. Those who deny it are hypocrites. The PFL does not 
admit incongruous conduct. Over the years the party has helped 
in the functioning of the democratic system. We do not accept 
those who have no tradition of struggling for democracy, but who 
now talk about democracy and at the same time about social 
democracy. [passage omitted] 
  [Lobo] How will the PFL channel talks with other parties? 
  [Magalhaes] The PFL has competent people, and a competent, 
experienced, and serious man at the head of the party who has 
the ability to command. He is Jorge Bornhausen. He is 
currently leading very well with a democratic spirit and with a 
lot of aplomb. He has clearly demonstrated that the PFL wants to 
resolve Brazil's problems. 
  [Lobo] Problems always appear over the vice presidential 
candidacy of your party when an alliance between the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and the PFL is discussed. 
  [Magalhaes] We do not accept any type of problems. If there 
are problems, the respective party should resolve them 
internally. When the PFL has a problem it is always discussed 
internally. If you are referring to the PSDB, then it is up to 
the leaders that want to dispute the presidency to resolve the 
problem so they can talk with authority. 
  [Lobo] Could this alliance include the PDT [Democratic Labor 
Party]? 
  [Magalhaes] When I defend an alliance I believe no one 
should 
be excluded from the consultation. It is the situation, 
specially a party platform situation, that excludes a person. 
The way to react and to administrate, the way to perceive how 
the country's problems can be resolved are what separates one 
person from another. This why Lula [Workers Party, PT, leader 
Luis Inacio da Silva] isolates himself when he wants to create a 
totalitarian alliance instead of a democratic alliance. 
  [Lobo] Does the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] 
have a place in that alliance? 
  [Magalhaes] An alliance cannot exclude anyone on principle. 
[Rio de Janeiro State Governor Leonel] Brizola is better than 
[Orestes] Quercia. 
  [Lobo] Will this alliance be a rehash of the 1985 Democratic 
Alliance? 
  [Magalhaes] Each election is different and Brazil is now in 
a 
very different position than in 1984. It has something to do 
with justice: [Former President Tancredo] Neves was a 
compromiser, but he had the courage to make decisions when 
necessary. I was very close to him for a long time and despite 
what many people say, I observed how often he had to make 
decisions and how he rigorously complied with his commitments. 
He kept his word. On 12 August 1984, the day of the PMDB 
convention, I was the first minister to be named by Neves. He 
rigorously complied with his commitment, even though the media 
stated that I was not going to be a minister and that my fellow 
party members were concerned. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brasilia -- Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, PT [Workers 
Party] candidate, was harshly criticized yesterday during a 
meeting of the PT federal bloc to discuss the government program 
drafted by the PT executive board. Opposition to the 
controversial points in the program, such as the legalization of 
abortion and marriage between homosexuals -- namely from 
deputies Benedita da Silva (Rio de Janeiro) who belongs to the 
Evangelical Church, and Irma Passoni (Sao Paulo), who is 
Catholic -- forced Lula to review these subjects. 
  Deputy Irma Passoni said: "You cannot support these ideas 
before discussing them within the bloc." 
  Benedita commented: "This cannot be included in the 
government program, because it is a mistake. We are going to 
discuss it with the Church." 
  Lula answered: "We must look at abortion as a public health 
issue. Wealthy women go to posh clinics to have an abortion 
with little suffering. Poor women risk their lives at home, 
where abortions are performed under inadequate conditions." 
  Deputy Jose Genoino (PT-Sao Paulo) upheld the need to draft 
a 
new program for Lula's government. 
  Genoino said: "The PT has one program, while Lula has 
another. One cannot mix government politics with social issues." 
  The alliance parties -- the PPS [Peoples' Socialist Party] 
and the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party] -- also demand changes. 
The PPS, for example, does not accept a moratorium on the 
foreign debt. 
  In Sao Paulo, PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] 
President Tasso Jereissati asserted that the PT proposals make 
the possibility of an alliance between the two parties even more 
remote. 
  "The PT has become more and more distant from the PSDB. 
These PT proposals are an example of that." 
  Paulo Maluf, virtual PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] 
candidate, also criticized the PT. 
  Maluf commented: "The program has reached a deadlock, and 
Lula has contributed to this." 
  Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party], chose to criticize the program, 
which he labeled "Jurassic," in general terms. According to 
Fleury, the PT proposals regarding the debt and privatization 
subjects are "obsolete, and harmful" to the country.

  [Excerpt] The PT [Workers Party] platform, released on 14 
March, has elicited a negative reaction from the Church 
throughout our country. Fathers and bishops, even some of those 
identified as belonging to the progressive wing, with ties to 
the PT, denounced the platform's points involving abortion, 
contraception, and homosexual relations. 
  Juazeiro da Bahia Bishop Jose Rodrigues, a representative of 
the progressive wing that openly supported PT candidate Luiz 
Inacio Lula da Silva during past presidential elections, 
condemned the platform. He believes the two issues will cause a 
great "deterioration" in Lula's candidacy. The bishop noted: 
"The PT wanted to be responsive to these minority groups, but 
ended up alienating the majority." He added: "The people, in 
general, do not approve of these proposals." 
  The PT is not actually proposing the regularization of 
abortion or of marriage between homosexuals. The platform 
merely proposes "the establishment of regulations for the 
performance of abortion under safe conditions, through the 
public services." Concerning unions between homosexuals, the PT 
wants "proposals for legal changes guaranteeing the rights of 
married homosexual couples concerning civil marriage contracts, 
social security, partition of goods, and inheritance." [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Lucia Helena Gazzola] </F>
  [Text] Despite its open opposition to constitutional 
revision, the PT [Workers Party] would have to amend several 
provisions of the Constitution to implement its government 
program -- if this is passed without amendment, and if the PT is 
successful at the polls. Many of the proposals in the PT 
government program, which is still under discussion, directly 
contradict the Constitution and would entail making deep changes 
in nearly all its chapters. 
  By way of example, the endorsement of abortions to be 
performed at state-run health care centers jars directly with 
Article 5 of the Constitution, which guarantees the 
inviolability of the right to life and thus bans abortion. 
Another example of conflict is the PT's proposal to guarantee 
the right of homosexual couples to get married at a registry 
office, to have access to social security benefits, or to share 
or bequeath their assets to one another. Paragraph 3 of Article 
226 of the Constitution clearly recognizes the family unit to be 
the stable union between a man and a woman, thus excluding a 
union between people of the same sex. 
  The PT wants the Armed Forces' role to be circumscribed to 
defense of the borders, while the Constitution in Article 142 
provides for other duties, such as enforcing law and order and 
guaranteeing constitutional authority. The PT is campaigning 
for voluntary military service, while Article 143 of the 
Constitution stipulates that it is compulsory. The PT program 
proposes creating a Defense Ministry, to "guarantee cohesion in 
defense policy and reduce the corporate interests of each branch 
of the Armed Forces." Article 91 of the Constitution, however, 
takes the existence of the three military ministries (Army, 
Navy, and Aeronautics) for granted. 
  The federal system of government does not escape from this 
conflict, either. The PT intends to decentralize power and 
financial resources so that they will be equitably shared 
between the federal government, states, and municipalities. 
This would require amendments to Articles 25-31 and to Article 
145. The PT program jars with several points on the 
organization of the three branches of government as provided for 
in the Constitution. The PT program's defense of the principle 
of "a vote for each citizen," in referring to representation in 
the Chamber of Deputies, goes against Article 45 of the 
Constitution, which stipulates that all states are to be 
guaranteed a minimum of eight deputies and a maximum of 70. 
  Other examples include the PT's proposal to eliminate the 
revisory role of the Senate, which goes against Article 65, and 
the items pertaining to party affiliation and parliamentary 
immunity, which go against the provisions of Article 55.

  [Text] Troubled by the Catholic Church's negative attitude 
toward the inclusion of such things as abortion and the Union of 
Homosexuals in his government program project, PT [Workers 
Party] presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on 16 
March defended the fact that the definitive program, which will 
be approved during the party's national convention, only deals 
with what the executive branch can do. "The program cannot be 
fictitious; that is why it must be rational, feasible, and 
practical so that it can be implemented after the elections." 
  Lula expressed his feelings on 16 March after lunching with 
Maceio Mayor Ronaldo Lessa (PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party]), 
who is one of the possible vice presidential candidates for his 
ticket. He clearly stated that he does not agree to the 
inclusion of those topics in the program: "I do not know 
whether this has to do with a government program -- it could 
deal with legislative policy or the Constitution -- but I 
believed it to be democratic to include them in the program that 
is to be discussed." 
  The candidate also stated that he will not accept party 
impositions in this respect. "Not even Lula can impose a 
program on society, nor can the PT impose a program on Lula," he 
stressed. "The program has to contain what the government plans 
to do."

  [Text] Brasilia -- The Constituent Congress on 15 March 
rejected a proposal to substitute the obligatory vote with the 
non-compulsory vote. Of the 436 congressmen who voted, 236 
rejected the measure, 193 supported it, and seven abstained. 
The proposal was submitted by the general rapporteur, Deputy 
Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio 
Grande do Sul State]. Had the measure been approved it would 
have gone into effect in 1995. It would not have been valid for 
this year's elections. 
  The implementation of the non-compulsory vote was defended 
by 
Deputy Jose Genoino (PT-SP) [Workers Party-Sao Paulo State]. He 
said the non-compulsory vote would rock safe electoral districts 
and affect the floating vote. Jose Serra (SP) [Sao Paulo 
State], the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democratic Party] leader in 
the Chamber of Deputies, also defended the non-compulsory vote. 
"A right should not be converted into an obligation," he 
stressed. 
  In their speeches to the plenum, Deputies Liberato Caboclo 
(PDT-SP) [Democratic Labor Party-Sao Paulo State] and Roberto 
Freire (PPS-PE) [People's Socialist Party-Pernambuco State], 
former government leader in the Chamber of Deputies, spoke out 
against it. Caboclo said the measure would stimulate political 
incapability. 
  Freire said the obligation to vote is a duty of the people. 
"This is why the vote must be obligatory," he stressed. Senator 
Josaphat Marinho (PFL-BA) [Liberal Front Party-Bahia State] 
adopted the same line of thought, saying that to have approved 
the non-compulsory vote would have "abandoned the fundamental 
rules of the people."

  [Text] The government yesterday reduced to 2 percent the 
import tariffs paid on 41 groups of products, in order to force 
a drop in prices. According to an official note released 
yesterday, the list could be expanded if the Finance Ministry 
identifies other sectors that are considered oligopolies and for 
which there is world competition. 
  Of the approximately 132 products in the list, 103 are 
medicines. The others are hygiene and cleaning products, like 
matches and steel wool, which have little effect on living 
costs. Margarine and the materials for producing it are the 
only food products in the list. 
  The resolution with the list, which was signed by Finance 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, can be suspended at any 
time. The ministry declined to report whether the sectors that 
are affected by the resolution have actually increased their 
prices above inflation. The resolution says only that "the 
government has detected that in various sectors in which just a 
few enterprises are operating, the process of commercial opening 
that began in 1990 did not go far enough to check significant 
price increases in real terms." 
  The 41 products, of a total of 13,000 products on the 
Brazilian Custom Tariffs list, were compiled so as "not to 
produce excessive lack of protection, which might have caused 
unemployment in the national industry," the resolution states. 
  The list of products did not meet the expectations of 
economic team members. FOLHA learned that the initial proposal 
included home electrical appliances, electrical and electronic 
products, and petrochemicals. This would have had repercussions 
on the textile, ink, and dye production sectors. The ministry 
of industry, commerce, and tourism opposed reducing taxes in 
those sectors on the grounds that it would have harmed the 
medium and long-term industrial policy. 
  Yesterday morning, before publication of the list of 
products 
whose import tariffs would be reduced, Minister Cardoso said 
that the reduction of the tariffs paid on products whose prices 
suffered abusive increases should make prices return to their 
normal level. 
  "It is quite an effective measure, and we should try 
carefully to avoid any demagogic use of it," he said. According 
to the minister, any country in the situation that Brazil is in, 
with a high level of international reserves and an open economy, 
would also have reduced import tariffs. 
  Cardoso asked entrepreneurs to respect people's aspirations 
and to refrain from imposing abusive price increases. 
"Enterprises are important, and we should appreciate both 
enterprises and entrepreneurs, but they should also understand 
that they cannot ignore the aspirations of the people. People 
cannot bear irresponsible price increases," the minister said.

<F P=106> [Article by Otto Sarkis: "Ceara's Collor"; introductory </F>
paragraph in boldface as published] 
  [Text] Fortaleza--Ciro Gomes is copying the good and 
bad points of the "maharaja hunter" [Fernando Collor]. And he, 
too, wants to capture the presidency. 
  Since taking office as governor of Ceara, the country's 
third-poorest state, attorney Ciro Gomes (PSDB [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party]), 36, has spent 263 days away from his 
domain--meaning that he has been absent an average of two days a 
week. He has made 101 trips, seven of them abroad. During his 
1,059 days as governor, Ciro Gomes has reduced the infant 
mortality rate by 32 percent to its current level of 32 deaths 
per 1,000 and won awards from UNICEF for his program for 
training sanitary agents. Since taking office on 15 March 1991, 
he has been ranked as Brazil's most popular governor in polls by 
the IBOPE [Brazilian Public Opinion and Statistics Institute]. 
Recently, however, the Ciro Gomes administration has been 
infected by cholera. 
  Data published by the National Health Foundation (FNS) show 
Ceara to be the state with the most cholera cases. The governor 
has been no less choleric in the political area. "Congress has 
grown rotten," was his opening shot. In his first interview 
following a two-week stay in Japan and Taiwan, Ciro attacked the 
Left and the Right when he was questioned about the presidential 
succession. "No one should be deceived by the alliance between 
the PSDB and the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]," he 
said. "The PMDB is a machine dominated by former Governor 
Orestes Quercia and former President Jose Sarney, and I am going 
to stay away from anyplace where those people are." The governor 
also hit hard at the Left. "I feel that Lula and the PT [Workers 
Party] are incapable of governing Brazil," he said. "The Office 
of President of the Republic is not the place for 
apprenticeship." 
  Ciro's interview was published on the same day that the 
amendment establishing the Emergency Social Fund was passed, and 
it caused Minister of Finance Fernando Henrique Cardoso to meet 
with the PMDB's top leadership for nearly two hours. The meeting 
was inspired by Para Governor Jader Barbalho. "Today's 
newspapers report attacks directed against us by the former 
Arena [National Renewal Alliance] member, underling to the 
dictatorship, and current governor of Ceara," Jader wrote in a 
letter, dated Wednesday, 2 February, in which he called for 
steps to be taken by party president Luiz Henrique. PSDB 
deputies became the target of jokes by their colleagues, who 
tried to detect in them the odor of the rotten Congress. 
  "Instead of speaking cholerically, the governor ought to be 
taking care of cholera in his state," was the criticism from Sao 
Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury (PMDB). "Everything indicates 
that he wants to be a candidate by causing Fernando Henrique's 
failure," Fleury said. "I think that shot was fired from 
Carandiru," retorted Ciro Gomes, making a pun on the name of the 
penitentiary in Sao Paulo where 111 prisoners were massacred. 
During the first 31 days of 1994, about 7,000 cholera cases were 
reported in Ceara, 85 percent of them in Fortaleza. That state 
alone has accounted for 90 percent of all cholera cases in the 
country. "Cholera is a disease caused by poverty and lack of 
sanitation," explains FNS president Alvaro Machado. 
  In Brasilia and among advisers to the probable presidential 
candidates, Ciro Gomes's statements have increased the suspicion 
that his plan to leave the government for a period of study at 
Harvard University in the United States is nothing but talk. "He 
is a candidate," says a PSDB leader with ties to Senator Mario 
Covas. "We have already had Collor I, and now here comes Collor 
II," is the ironic comment by Luiz Carlos Santos (PMDB, Sao 
Paulo), government leader in the Chamber of Deputies. And 
economist Edmar Bacha, special adviser to the minister of 
finance, said at one meeting: "With a friend like Ciro, Fernando 
doesn't need any enemies." 
  But the festival of attacks on the PSDB's possible allies in 
a presidential campaign must not be regarded as a foolish 
political move by the governor. It is a strategic necessity for 
anyone needing to make room for himself in the presidential 
race. In distancing himself from all the political bosses, Ciro 
is trying to come across as a politician who is different. "I am 
not building my candidacy because I am not part of the old 
crooked politics," Ciro said in an interview with CBN radio on 
Thursday the 3d. 
  Everyday routine in the Ceara state administration proves, 
however, that he is very much like other governors. On the 
pretext of preserving a mangrove swamp, Ciro Gomes established 
the 600-hectare Coco Park. In that region he built the best 
roads in Fortaleza--providing access to the Iguatemi Shopping 
Center owned by the family of the PSDB's president, Tasso 
Jereissati. The matter of the cholera outbreak exemplifies the 
gap between talk and practice. The state took first place in the 
country [in number of cholera cases] in March 1993. The 
ineffectiveness of the PSDB administration can be judged from a 
report by the Ministry of Health. "It needs to be emphasized 
that in the 10 months since it took first place, [cholera] cases 
have risen from 21.89 per 100,000 population to 335.38 per 
100,000, an increase of approximately 1,500 percent," says the 
report. 
  That jump in the number of cases at the start of this year 
had an even more perverse cause: the Workers Canal, the most 
sparkling achievement of Ciro Gomes's administration. Built in 
105 days by 11 construction firms and 5,000 workers, it cost $48 
million and was supposed to prevent water rationing in 
Fortaleza, whose 2 million residents were suffering their third 
year of drought. When the canal water arrived, it was brackish, 
and the rationing system of 48 hours with water and 48 hours 
without continued despite the rain that had started falling, and 
most of the capital's 700,000 shantytown dwellers began using 
water from creeks or ponds--making the cholera outbreak 
uncontrollable. 
  Since October, moved by the government's ineffectiveness in 
the social area, the Catholic Church has been announcing 
decreasing support for the state administration. A communique 
distributed by the CNBB [National Conference of Brazilian 
Bishops] criticized neoliberalism. With the authorization of 
Archbishop Aloisio Lorscheider of Fortaleza, Ciro Gomes's 
administration was criticized. "According to that logic, people 
do not count; the important thing is money and wealth," the 
document says. "That has also been the logic behind the Ceara 
administration's thinking on economic growth. Although official 
propaganda camouflages reality, the development plan adopted by 
the elites and business leaders of our state is radically 
strengthening neoliberalism by accelerating the concentration of 
income and, consequently, pronounced social inequalities." 
  The figures concerning a sick population forced the Ceara 
governor to undertake a desperate offensive to preserve the 
image built during his 35 months as governor and his 94 trips 
around Brazil. ISTOE was the target of that strategy on 
Thursday. At the governor's palace in Fortaleza, Gomes began a 
three-hour interview by suggesting that ISTOE was in the 
"perhaps involuntary" service "of the PMDB and Orestes Quercia." 
The reporter, according to Ciro's logic of persecution, had 
traveled to Ceara to refute the critical remarks he had made 
about Quercia two days earlier. But not even Ciro could believe 
what he was saying: his adviser Egidio Serpa had already 
announced that part of the attack on Quercia was a preventive 
measure in preparation for a "possible negative report" by our 
magazine. Unfortunately for Ciro's argument, the reporter had 
arrived in Fortaleza before the governor turned his ire on the 
former president of the PMDB. 
  Ciro Gomes is married, has three children, lives in a rented 
house, and drives a 1982 Parati. He renounced his pension as a 
state deputy and lives on a salary of about $4,000. One of his 
brothers is a deputy, another is a chef de cabinet, and one of 
his sisters is married to the manager of the video firm that 
produces the government's publicity films. "The firm is hired by 
the agencies, which win their contracts in public bidding," says 
Sergio Pires, the official in charge of that area. As governor, 
Gomes is a typical example of a politician whose finances as an 
individual are much more transparent than his finances as a 
legal entity. To avoid giving fuel to his opponents, he 
dissuaded a brother from buying a house with financing from a 
state-owned bank. On the other hand, he is unable to say how 
much his administration has spent on publicity. "I don't know," 
he told ISTOE. "With all this inflation, I can't figure it out." 
  Within the Ceara administration, however, the cost of roads 
and other public works is reported down to the penny. It is 
reported, but not published. State Deputy Eudoro Santana (PSB 
[Brazilian Socialist Party]) has submitted two bills requiring 
the administration to publish a monthly statement of the state's 
accounts. The first bill was passed by the Legislative Assembly 
and vetoed by the governor. The second bill failed to win a 
majority. Unless the administration takes the initiative and 
makes its accounts transparent, the PSDB's spending on publicity 
is about to become a matter for the courts. The public 
prosecutor of the republic, Oscar da Costa Filho, has told ISTOE 
that this week he will begin a public civil action charging Ciro 
Gomes with personal promotion in publicity paid for out of 
public funds. 
  The governor says his lengthy interviews in official 
publications regarding his administration's achievements are 
necessary in order to break the boycott by Green Seas TV, which 
is the Globo Network's local affiliate but which is controlled 
by a political opponent of the PSDB group: businessman Edson 
Queiroz Filho, the brother-in-law of Tasso Jereissati. The 
family feud between Edson Queiroz and Tasso has led to some of 
the most low-down fights in Ceara politics. The governor accused 
the businessman of belonging to a degenerate family. The 
response was an article published as a paid advertisement in 
several of the country's newspapers and depicting Gomes as a 
pregnant sow. 
  A factor in Ciro Gomes's favor if he decides to run for 
president is his excellent relations with the owners and editors 
of Brazil's major publications. In an interview with the 
magazine IMPRENSA that was published in January, for example, he 
said he had direct access to the president of the Globo 
Organizations, Roberto Marinho. The two men have met with each 
other five times. "One `Globo Reporter' is worth more than 100 
PSDB or PT conventions," Ciro says. In 1989, that rapprochement 
with Globo was an essential element in helping Collor become 
known as the "maharaja hunter." The next 18-hour soap opera will 
be recorded in Ceara. 
<H5>  Case of the Pregnant Sow </H5>
  About 30 piglets entered the election campaign in Ceara last 
Christmas. Arriving in cages like those used to carry pets on 
aircraft, the "suckling pigs," as they are called in Ceara, were 
distributed to the first echelon of Ciro Gomes's administration 
on the evening of 24 December. A card signed by a mysterious 
"Fraternity of the Pregnant Sow" accompanied the "present." Days 
earlier, over 100,000 stickers had been distributed around the 
state. They showed the governor as a pregnant sow offering her 
teats to greedy assistant piglets. 
  Commenting on the episode in the local press, Ciro Gomes, 
faithful to his strategy of trying to turn the opposition's 
attacks against it, sought once again to turn the attack to his 
own advantage. The governor said in an interview that the 
fraternity in question was a support organization set up by 
humorous friends. The effects of that comparison on the 
governor's popularity are not yet known. 
  The story began with a debate on the "Commotion" program on 
Sao Paulo's Culture TV early in December. When one of the 
interviewees questioned the similarities between his political 
style and that of the adventurer Fernando Collor, Ciro said he 
preferred being compared to a pregnant young sow. According to 
the governor, the phrase is part of a popular saying in his 
native Sobral: "You can compare me to a pregnant sow because if 
I produce a litter, I'll give you one of the piglets," Ciro said. 
  Swinish remarks aside, the governor of Ceara's profile has 
visible similarities with that of the now-rejected former 
president who was thrown out of office because of corruption. 
Both men began their political careers in the PDS [Democratic 
Social Party] under the military governments and with jobs given 
to them by their fathers. Whereas Senator Arnon de Mello made 
his rebel son the mayor of Maceio, the former mayor of Sobral, 
Euclides Ferreira Gomes, rewarded his newly graduated son in 
1982 by making him the municipal attorney. 
  From there, as a member of the PDS, Ciro ran for state 
deputy, was elected second alternate, and took over the seat. 
According to the governor, his membership in the PDS was "a 
matter of circumstances," since there was no room in the PMDB. 
Once in the Legislative Assembly, Ciro made sure that his 
father, mother, and one brother were given positions of trust in 
Gonzaga Mota's administration. When Gonzaga had a falling out 
with political bosses Adauto Bezerra, Virgilio Tavora, and Cesar 
Cals, the Ferreira Gomes family--which was part of the Cals 
clique--lost its three jobs in the administration.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary </F>
Committee-General Command of the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army "from the Mexican southeast" on 15 March] 
  [Text] 15 March 1994 
  "Shadows of a tender rage; our steps will protect the 
have-nots." 
  To the State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations 
(CEOIC), the Mexican people, the people and governments of the 
world, the national and international press, and brothers: 
  The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General 
Command [CCRI-CG] of the Zapatist Army of National Liberation 
[EZLN] respectfully and honorably addresses all of you in order 
to state the following: 
  The Federal Government, yesterday's usurper of the people's 
power, once again is lying about the dialogue in San Cristobal 
de las Casas, Chiapas. The government says there are 
"agreements," when there was nothing more than a dialogue. 
Brothers, do not be deceived by their lies; the powerful now 
seek to usurp the truth, and they are trying to mislead you by 
saying that peace is only a signature away. 
  How can there be peace if the ones who caused the war are 
still calling for the continuation of our poverty? The 
arrogance that dwells within the government palaces and the 
houses of the monarchs of commerce and property continues to 
call for war and for our genocide. They cannot accept that 
Indian blood might be equal to that of the white man. We seek 
to become part of the country, yet they continue to block our 
efforts, and now they repay the sacrifice of our dead with 
contempt and ridicule. 
  If they speak with contempt, how can there be peace in these 
lands, or if they remain silent and murder our brothers? How 
can we ask our collective heart whether the time has come for 
peace to enter with dignity through the doors of our 
impoverished lands? They seek to corner us once again and force 
us to surrender. Through the destruction of our dignity they 
seek to force us to accept a peace that represents war to our 
people. 
  We will not do it. We will not surrender. If they refuse a 
fair and honorable peace, then we -- the men and women of the 
shadows -- will once again dress for war. Our rage will now 
rise up from having been deceived. The machetes are once again 
being sharpened, and our lands will once again wreak of 
gunpowder. 
  We are shadows of a tender rage. Our strategy will once 
again reverberate in the heavens and give shelter to the 
have-nots and the good men and women who understand that justice 
and peace go hand in hand. If they deny our rights, then our 
tender rage will enter their haughty mansions. We will overrun 
every wall. No door will remain intact, and no window will 
remain unbroken. No wall will be left standing. Our shadow 
will carry sorrow to those who call for war and the genocide of 
our race. More tears will be spent and more deaths will take 
place so that peace can sit at humanity's table. 
  We, the shadows of tender rage, will once again raise our 
voice to drown out the lies. Our first "enough" was 
insufficient. The land will not blossom with the blood of our 
dead. 
  The men and women of tender rage will have to march once 
again, our dead will have to rise once again, and the history of 
our broken hearts will speak once again. Let the deceit and 
lies cease. Let arrogance in the lands of Mexico perish once 
and for all. Let the men of women of the shadows, adorned in 
the dark clothes of tender rage, gather in order that we may 
silence so many lies. 
  The powerful should no longer speak. From their lips come 
poison and decay. They must stop the lies and duplicity. 
  It is time for our brothers who are following other paths to 
speak out and carry our grief to new horizons. We want to hear 
the voices of our brothers from the CEOIC. All of the Indians 
of this land must speak their minds. The impoverished peasants 
must not remain silent. The workers in the cities must shout. 
This warriors' song must be sung by teachers, students, 
workers, and all of those people who are diminutive in every 
sense of the word. 
  Do not leave this heavy banner in our hands alone. Everyone 
must help carry it. Let us all change the land on which its 
shadow falls. Mexican brothers, do not forget this voice in the 
wilderness. The light shed by our dead is very remote. Let us 
add other lights. Let us end this shameful night once and for 
all. The time has come for a new dawn. 
  Let the truth speak. Let its voice be heard now. Let it 
walk with brave footfalls. We, who have no face or past listen 
with open hearts and ears. Let the voice of everyone be heard. 
Let our men and women remain silent, and let this silence 
continue in the shadows of tender rage. [sentence as published] 
  All of you must watch over our dreams so that nothing bad 
will happen to them -- so that black shadows will not threaten 
them. For you, brothers, our hearts continue to beat and our 
fire continues to burn, and we hope that everything will be well 
with you so that, in the end, this tender rage will prevail in 
these lands. 
  Peace is not possible with deceit. Peace is born of freedom 
and is nurtured by justice. We are all worthy of democracy. 
  Cheers, brothers of the CEOIC! Cheers, Indian brothers! 
Cheers, Mexican brothers! Walk without fear, lift your heads, 
and pick up your feet. Our weapons are already guarding your 
path... 
  Freedom! Justice! Democracy! 
  Respectfully yours from the Mexican southeast, 
  [Signed] CCRI-CG of the EZLN 
  [Dated] Mexico, March 1994

  [Text] 15 March 1994 
  To the people of Mexico, to the people and governments of 
the 
world, to the local and international media, brothers: 
  The CCRI-CG [Indian Revolutionary Clandestine 
Committee-General Command] of the EZLN [Zapatist National

state the following: 
  Since the phase prior to the San Cristobal dialogue, the 
CCRI-CG of the EZLN requested legal support with various 
problems that the war process and the peace process presented 
for our Army. We received no immediate replies. The 
righteousness of our struggle was getting lost amid slander and 
mistrust. Only one reply reached us at the time and it was that 
of our brothers in the Civic Action National Coordinating Board 
for National Liberation (CONAC-LN), who offered the support of 
their legal commission. 
  We stated our thanks for this gesture, and we gave these 
people our trust. They will do everything within their power to 
legally support us. Our needs are great. We welcome the 
devotion and selflessness of our brothers in the CONAC-LN, and 
we address the Mexican people to ratify what we recently told 
these brothers: All the legal affairs of the EZLN will be 
entrusted to the CONAC-LN's legal commission. 
  Liberty! Justice! Democracy! Respectfully yours, from the 
Mexican Southeast.

<F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Aleman Aleman] </F>
  [Text] Upon learning that the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army [EZLN] ratified the Civic Action National Coordinating 
Board for National Liberation (CONAC-LN) as its legal adviser, 
leaders of this group denied being the "political arm" of the 
rebels or belonging to the EZLN. 
  Ricardo Barco and Benito Miron Lince said: "It should be 
clear that we listen to the opinion of civilian society. We are 
not seeking to make CONAC grow as an organization. Our 
representatives have made it very clear that the EZLN is one 
part of the organization and civilian society is another." 
  As for the possibility that the coordinating board will 
harbor other organizations, they pointed out: "Our goal is not 
to make CONAC grow, but we are not opposed to other 
organizations either. We are not aiming to become a political 
organization. We want to listen to civilian society, and those 
who understand this are welcome." 
  Barco and Miron insisted: "We are definitely not the 
political arm of the EZLN, because it is clear that the power 
that we were given is the power of juridical or legal 
representation to appear before international forums, 
authorities, and organizations -- a representation that has a 
legitimate nature granted by the armed group. 
  "It must also be clear that as members of CONAC's legal 
commission, we are not EZLN members. We are accepting work as 
agents in the terms agreed upon with the EZLN. Our capacity as 
legal representatives will last as long as our client 
[otorgante] deems it advisable. There are authorities, however, 
who are demanding representation before a notary public, but 
that is not possible. There must be no confusion between our 
mandate and possible sympathies for the EZLN struggle," they 
pointed out. 
  Born in the wake of the armed incidents of 1 January 1994 
and 
established on 10 February, CONAC-LN was ratified yesterday as 
the EZLN legal representative through a letter addressed to the 
general public and signed by Subcommander Marcos. 
  The EZLN approved the CONAC-LN's legal commission as the 
legal representative for the Zapatists. Their first work 
consisted of a juridical study of proposals made by Commissioner 
Camacho Solis. Another assignment is the installation of 
civilian society tables in various states, such as the one 
installed in Mexico City on 14 March. 
  Finally, those who are responsible for the CONAC-LN legal 
commission stated: "One of the EZLN aims is to demonstrate the 
willingness of the Zapatist movement -- the will to achieve a 
dignified peace."

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal de las </F>
Casas, Chiapas State; from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast -- 
live] 
  [Excerpt] About 45 minutes ago, we received three Indian 
Revolutionary Clandestine Committee-General Command [CCRI-CG] 
communiques from the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army]. 
In two of the three communiques, the CCRI-CG of the EZLN appeals 
to the nation and international communities. They are classical 
communiques by Subcommander Marcos. Nonetheless, one of them 
attracts more attention because the EZLN openly criticizes the 
government, pointing out that the reports saying peace 
agreements have been reached are false. The EZLN says that the 
first stage of the dialogue has concluded, but this only means 
precisely that, the first stage of the dialogue has concluded. 
No specific agreements have been reached for signing a peace 
agreement. The communique points out that consultations continue 
to be held in Lacandona jungle, in the EZLN-controlled 
communities, and that these consultations will continue. The 
important thing to remember is that one must not think this 
first dialogue has led to the signing of specific agreements. 
The EZLN points out that a lot still remains to be done. 
  Regarding this communique which circulated today in San 
Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, Manuel Camacho Solis, special 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation, was here in San 
Cristobal de las Casas. First, he met with the coleta [natives 
of San Cristobal de las Casas] community to discuss the problems 
that have arisen within this dialogue process causing serious 
unhappiness among many of the residents of the area. They have 
had problems with their normal lives, and now they have another 
problem stemming from the land squatters. Let us listen to what 
Manuel Camacho Solis had to say in the news conference when he 
referred to all of this and settled some doubts on the most 
recent EZLN communique dated 15 March, which we received here 
today. 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] I am going to be very brief, 
as I am about to leave and return to Mexico City. I want to 
report on two very important points. The first refers to the 
meeting I had with the various groups from the city of San 
Cristobal de las Casas, where there has been a certain amount of 
tension. We have reached an atmosphere of cordiality, however, 
and we have searched for the path of reconciliation for 
everyone, and all the groups fully support the entire peace 
dialogue process occurring in the State of Chiapas, particularly 
the city of San Cristobal. 
  Concerning the dialogue, I would like to take advantage of 
my 
visit here to strongly insist on a point that the media has not 
made sufficiently clear and which could cause confusion. The 
point is: The EZLN presented its list of demands. The 
government, through me, made a counteroffer. This counteroffer 
is being presented to the communities for consideration. At no 
time, has it been said... [pauses] nor can it be said that these 
are the points of the agreement. We have made a lot of progress 
because we were able to establish a dialogue, but these 
discussions are most important. If the situation is not 
sufficiently clear, this could create the wrong idea among the 
communities with regard to the good will there has been in the 
entire peace process. I want to ask you to help us with this 
clarification because otherwise the wrong idea about the nature 
of the process could be reached. Now, the most important thing 
is that there are two basic issues: 
  One, this is a process of searching for peace, which we are 
going to pursue regardless of the circumstances. Two, this is 
what allowed us to hold a dialogue. The dialogue is of great 
value. We are not going to stop talking under any circumstances. 
We have learned that the EZLN is a serious organization with 
leaders that have clear political ideas, and this factor is 
going to help us overcome any confusion and tension which is 
sometimes generated by the wrong interpretation of public 
messages. 
  I repeat: There was a list of demands; the government 
countered with a proposal that is being presented for 
consultation and approval by the communities. Second, we are 
pursuing the path of peace, dialogue, and a political solution 
which will not be changed. This commissioner is fully committed 
to overcoming any confusion and continuing to move forward on 
the path the State of Chiapas and all of Mexican society wants. 
  I think this clarifies the two important points. The 
situation in San Cristobal is clear; the points of conflict will 
be resolved. This afternoon, I met with all sectors of society. 
Therefore, the correct atmosphere for the peace process prevails 
here. The other central point is about the meeting, which I 
think is very important, to clearly establish that we respect 
the procedures and what we talked about in San Cristobal with 
the EZLN. Thank you very much [end recording] [passage omitted]

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 27 February Mexico City daily 
REFORMA cites a "high-level military officer assigned to 
Chiapas" who states that satellites and other means are being 
used to plan for a possible offensive against the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army (EZLN), should peace negotiations break 
down. The officer, who asked that his name be withheld, says: 
"Military Intelligence continues to work, even during the 
cease-fire period and the peace dialogue,...to discover access 
routes into the mountains and the forest. Satellites are being 
used to identify Zapatist assembly areas, new entry routes for 
infantry units, and drop zones for Mexican Army parchutists." He 
also notes that "we have found new exit routes, and the more we 
look the more we find; this is ongoing because we have got to be 
ready for any eventuality, in case there is no [peace] accord."

  [Text] Mexico City, 16 Mar (EFE) -- A delegation believed 
to be associated with the Zapatist National Liberation Army 
(EZLN) is in Mexico City to discuss the agreements between the 
EZLN and Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas. 
  The so-called Civilian Society Board has its headquarters in 
Zocalo, Mexico City's urban and political center, and is 
expected to continue operating until 10 April, the anniversary 
of the murder of revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata, the name 
the guerrillas decided to adopt during their 1 January 
insurrection. 
  The discussion is somewhat similar to what the EZLN is 
already doing in the Laconda jungle and Altos de Chiapas 
communities. It is aimed at obtaining approval or disapproval of 
the agreements signed on 3 March in San Cristobal de las Casas, 
located 780 km southeast of Mexico City. 
  In the capital city, the Judicial Commission of the Civic 
Action National Coordinator for National Liberation (CONAC-LN), 
founded by Benito Miron, former official of the Federal Labor 
Board, and Ricardo Barco, leader of the Proletariat Independent 
Movement (MPI), organized the consultation. Both said they have 
documents signed by EZLN military leader Subcommander Marcos 
where the military leader acknowledges them as his legal 
representatives in Mexico City. They both said that during the 
consultation they expect to learn society's opinion on whether 
or not the government's answers satisfy the demands that 
prompted the EZLN to take up arms. The consultation also seeks 
to establish society's opinion on whether or not the agreement 
between the government and the guerrillas will allow peace with 
dignity, which is one of the Zapatists' main demands. 
  In addition, the discussion tables will receive general 
proposals to be included in a "list of proposals by the civilian 
society which will be sent to the EZLN and the Mexican 
Government to be taken into account in possible future 
dialogues." 
  The CONAC-LN foresees the establishment of similar 
discussion 
tables in other cities, according to Miron and Barco, who 
disclosed the results of a legal study on the previous 
agreements between the Zapatist guerrillas and the government. 
According to analysts, the official responses to the Zapatists 
were made "in a confusing, evasive language void of concrete 
proposals." 
  In February, the EZLN offered to present all the agreements 
reached by the 19 delegates of the Indian Revolutionary 
Clandestine Committee with Camacho Solis in a referendum. The 
encounter that lasted 10 days took place at the more than 
100-year-old San Cristobal de las Casa cathedral, and Bishop 
Samuel Ruiz Garcia, dioceses official, was the mediator. 
  The Zapatist delegates presented 34 demands, 32 on the 
social 
and economic situation of 1 million Indians in Chiapas to which 
Camacho Soils offered, in the government's behalf, 34 solutions. 
After that meeting, the Zapatists discussed each of the 
agreements with the communities under their influence in Altos 
de Chiapas and the Laconada Jungle, where allegedly 
approximately 300,000 persons live. 
  The government refused to discuss national policies with the 
EZLN. The EZLN had demanded Carlos Salinas de Gortari's 
resignation or a change in the electoral legislation to 
guarantee impartiality of the 21 August presidential elections.

  [Text] Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has 
announced the creation of a Guatemalan-Mexican binational trade 
committee. During the second day of his visit to Mexico, 
Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio held a working 
meeting with members of the Mexican Businessmen's Council for 
International Affairs, CEMAI. He told Mexican and Guatemalan 
businessmen that the big challenges facing Latin America today 
are to fight poverty, to increase production, and to eliminate 
the banners of subversion, because there are those who use 
poverty and injustice as banners to destabilize. 
  The Guatemalan president announced the creation of a 
binational committee headed by the Mexican trade secretary and 
Guatemalan trade minister so that access to both markets will be 
facilitated at the government level. Later, Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio met for 30 minutes with Mr. Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, 
president of the National Human Rights Commission. At the end 
of the meeting the Guatemalan president said that the task of a 
human rights defender is difficult in any country, but that it 
is even more complicated when there are movements, such as the 
one earlier this year in the State of Chiapas. 
  [Begin de Leon recording] I have said so very frankly and 
very sincerely, as I am accustomed to speaking. I envy you. I 
envy you, because I would have liked it if the internal armed 
conflict in Guatemala could have been resolved as quickly as 
this confrontation was solved here. [end recording] 
  Later, the Guatemalan president made a private visit to the 
San Angel Televisa Studios. President Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
ended his official visit by meeting in the afternoon with a 
Guatemalan delegation in Mexico.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Mexican elections 
scheduled for 21 August 1994. 
  On 8 March, Oscar Espinoza Villareal, finance secretary for 
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, denied reports that 
his party had a special fund for the business sector to make 
donations to Luis Donaldo Colosio's presidential campaign. 
During a meeting of the PRI National Territorial Movement, 
Espinoza said "his party does not depend solely on the business 
sector for funds, and it would not use the sector as a means of 
finding other sources." He called on party leaders "to be wise 
in spending campaign money so as to prevent misunderstandings." 
(Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in Spanish 9 Mar 94 p 11A) 
  On 10 March, PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio met with 
trade and service leaders in Mexico City and offered to 
deregulate certain areas of the government bureaucracy which 
affects them. He said he would set "clear rules to eliminate 
subjective decisions and extensively simplify the tax process." 
He asked the leaders to present proposals during the campaign. 
Through dialogue, he said, "I want to find the best ways for the 
country to move into the 21st Century as a more sovereign and 
just nation." In addressing unemployment and the contribution of 
small and medium enterprise, he affirmed that "more guarantees 
should be offered for those who take the risk to invest." 
(Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 11 Mar 94 p 5) 
  On 10 March, PRI Candidate Colosio met with hundreds of 
radio 
and television industry businessmen, executives, and workers. He 
told them that "Mexico is a more informed, demanding, and 
critical nation." Therefore, he added, "information is 
fundamental for transforming Mexico." He said: "PRI and its 
presidential candidate are not afraid of political competition, 
but we do fear political incompetence." Pointing out that PRI 
was the first to call a debate, he said: "We want Mexican men 
and women to have access to better information to make their 
decisions." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 1430 
GMT 11 Mar 94) 
  PRI Candidate Luis Colosio attended several events on 10 
March, including breakfast with the Rotary Club, lunch with 
party leaders, and dinner with members of the Mexican-Lebanese 
community. The message was the same at all three: Mexico has 
set its course, and that course will lead to social well-being. 
"I believe we must look toward our grass-roots communities," he 
said, "because nothing grows from the sky down. Everything 
grows from the ground up." (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in 
Spanish 0000 GMT 12 Mar 94) 
  Luis Colosio visited Nuevo Leon University on 14 March. 
There he said that "Mexico requires a gradual democratic 
transformation. Pluralism is what makes us stronger." He 
stressed that in such a system "all Mexicans will have the 
wonderful opportunity to decide and to elect." (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 1430 GMT 15 mar) 
  On 9 March upon arrival in Monterrey for a meeting with 
university students, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate 
for the Party of the Democratic Revolution, PRD, said his party 
is totally independent from the government system. He expressed 
regret that there were no other independent candidates or 
parties, except for Pablo Emilio Madero, who is running for the 
National Opposition Union. He said Diego Fernandez de Cevallos 
of the National Action Party, PAN, and Rafael Aguilar Talamantes 
of the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, PFCRN, 
are playing the government's game. 
  The meeting between Cardenas and the students took place at 
the Monterrey Technological Institute and was broadcast by 
satellite to several other universities throughout the country. 
He said: "Social spending should be planned responsibly, 
effectively, and efficiently, and without political conditions. 
This is the area that has seen the least progress in the past 
few years." He added that "inefficiency, corruption, waste, and 
selectiveness has been the general tone" in this area. (Mexico 
City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 10 Mar 94) 
  PRD Candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas addressed proposals 
presented by the business sector on 9 March. "I do not know all 
the details," he stated, "but I am pleased that they agree with 
what I, as the candidate of the country's democratic forces, 
have been proposing to save our economy. I hope the business 
sector is, as they say, determined to offer their help in saving 
the country." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 
1430 GMT 11 mar 94) 
  PAN presidential candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos and 
presidential candidate Jorge Gonzalez Torres, for the Mexican 
Green Ecologist Party, PEM, visited the National Autonomous 
University on 11 March. Fernandez de Cevallos spoke to 
chemistry students and said the nation's universities should 
serve as forums for political debate between presidential 
candidates. He said there should be better ties between the 
business sector and the universities to enhance specific areas 
of study. 
  Meanwhile, PEM candidate Gonzalez Torres met with political 
science students and warned that Chiapas is an example of what 
can happen when there is no authentic democratic expression. 
(Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 11 Mar 94) 
  Jorge Gonzalez Torres was formally registered on 14 March as 
the presidential candidate for the PEM. After the ceremony, he 
suggested holding a runoff election for the August contest. 
Gonzalez said: "It would be very good for Mexico." "If none of 
the candidates get 40 percent of the vote," he explained, "a run 
off election should be held. If the abstention rate reaches 30 
or 40 percent, the number of votes that the winner receives 
would still be small, but never less than 20 percent." (Mexico 
City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 15 Mar 94) 
  On 10 March, Pablo Emilio Madero registered as the Mexican 
Democratic Party's presidential candidate for the August 
election. Following his presentation at the Federal Electoral 
Institute, Madero said: "We should think about electoral code 
reforms for the future. We can meditate, discuss, and implement 
them later, but it will not be possible for this election." He 
also spoke in favor of appointing electoral prosecutors to 
prosecute electoral crimes. (Mexico City XEW Television Network

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 15 
March. 
  According to a survey by EL FINANCIERO NORESTE EMPRESARIAL, 
the 12 most important industrial groups in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon 
State experienced a 3 percent drop in profits because of 
instability in the international markets, the economic recession 
in Mexico, the high cost of money, and a drop in the peso's 
competitiveness compared to the U.S. dollar. (Mexico City EL 
FINANCIERO in Spanish 7 Mar 94 p 12) 
  According to the National Iron and Steel Chamber, Mexican 
iron and steel companies will invest $500 million this year; 50 
percent of which corresponds to the modernization process and 
environmental protection measures to be adopted by the Northern 
Steel Group. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 7 Mar 94 p 12) 
  According to Jorge Tamayo, general director of the Mexican 
National Railroads, railroad freight has increased 5 percent 
over the past two years but it has still not reached 1987-88 
levels when almost 60 million tons were transported by railroad. 
(Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 7 Mar 94 p 36) 
  According to the National Institute of Geography, 
Statistics, 
and Data Processing, 508,000 manufacturing workers lost their 
jobs in 1993. It also said that by the end of 1993, only 46.5 
percent of the economically active population, estimated last 
year to be approximately 25.38 million people, had formal jobs. 
(Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 9 Mar 94 pp 1, 52) 
  Even though Aeromexico and Mexicana de Aviacion airlines 
sustained 249 million pesos in losses in 1993, the consortium 
that operates both companies did better than its six closest 
foreign competitors. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 10 Mar 
94 p 47) 
  Mexican Petroleum (Pemex) and Protexa have announced the 
creation of an air freight service company with domestic 
capital. Pemex will participate with 49 percent of the stocks, 
and Protexa will be the leading shareholder. (Mexico City LA 
JORNADA in Spanish 10 Mar 94 p 47) 
  The Confederation of Mexican Workers revealed that during 
the 
current administration, 10 million Mexicans lost their jobs and 
those with jobs do not receive any benefits, social security 
benefits, and earn less than the minimum wage. It described the 
labor situation in the country as "alarming" because new jobs 
were not created between 1992 and 1993. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO 
in Spanish 10 Mar 94 p 9) 
  Inflation was reduced 0.5 percent in February. It is the 
lowest February inflation rate in the last 22 years. (Mexico 
City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 10 Mar 94) 
  Today, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said that 
in the past five years, Mexico has doubled its exports from $21 
billion to $42 billion. He added that exports experienced an 
annual growth of 11 percent. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0345 GMT 11 
Mar 94) 
  According to Mexican Stock Exchange figures, 84.2 percent of 
foreign capital invested in the Mexican Stock Exchange is 
concentrated in 15 companies, which makes foreign investment in 
national stocks very volatile. The Mexican Telephone System, 
alone, owns 40.3 percent of all foreign investments. (Mexico 
City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 11 Mar 94 p 8) 
  According to Banamex (National Bank of Mexico), the huge 
regional development imbalance is evident after reports 
indicated that two states, Nuevo Leon and the Federal District, 
with 13.95 percent of the total population, concentrate 35.63 
and 33.81 percent of the country's federal public investment and 
Gross Domestic Product respectively. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in 
Spanish 14 Mar 94 p 9) 
  The Commerce Secretariat has reported that Mexico received 
$2.371 billion in foreign investments in January 1994, which 
represents 86 percent of total investments during the first half 
of 1993. The largest foreign investors in Mexico during the last 
six years were: the United States with 63.8 percent, France with 
4.5 percent, UK with 4.5 percent, Switzerland with 4.4 percent, 
Germany with 3.5 percent, Netherlands with 2.5 percent, and 
Japan with 2 percent. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1523 GMT 
14 Mar 94) 
  According to an analysis drafted by the Bancomer Financial 
Group, public finances will register a 0.9 percent deficit by 
the end of this year as a result of the concentration of public 
expenditures in the first half of 1994. (Mexico City LA JORNADA 
in Spanish 14 Mar 94 p 49)

  [Text] The Febrerista Revolutionary Party [PRF], which 
hosted the visit of North Korean Vice Premier Kim Pok-sin to the 
country, has released a communique expressing its solidarity 
with the North Korean desire for unity. The communique asks the 
national government to maintain diplomatic or commercial 
relations with this socialist country. 
  "Our party had the honor of hosting a delegation from the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The delegation was headed 
by Vice Premier Kim Pok-sin and other North Korean Social 
Democratic Party members. The visit's purpose was to seek the 
opening of official relations with our government and counteract 
the biased disinformation and slander campaign against the DPRK 
that is disseminated by powers with world hegemonic interests in 
the region and that does not allow Korean brothers to seek their 
own solutions to their differences," the PRF communique says. 
  The communique adds that the delegation, accompanied by PRF 
politicians, fulfilled an agenda that included meetings with 
national government authorities and leaders of political 
parties, social movements, entrepreneurs, and industry. 
  The communique says the DPRK has made a 10-point proposal 
for 
Korea's reunification leading to the creation of a federative 
state encompassing north and south. The proposal says the new 
state will be established on the basis of mutual recognition and 
reciprocal tolerance of existing ideologies and regimes, with a 
unified national government where both states would have equal 
participation and similar prerogatives and obligations. 
  The communique says the Korean people are a homogeneous 
nation whose people lived in the same territory sharing their 
blood and cultural links for five millennia. The note says that 
ideological and administrative differences cannot be obstacles 
to peaceful coexistence. 
  "The PRF, as is well stated in its political ideology, is 
loyal to the principle of internationalism, the brotherhood of 
peoples, and their right to self-determination. This means that 
from the PRF's viewpoint, the national government must build 
links with all nations in the world within the framework of 
mutual respect. Peaceful coexistence feeds on these principles 
and relations between peoples must be funneled through cultural, 
technical, and commercial relations with due respect for each 
nation's idiosyncrasies," the PRF document stresses. 
  We must recall that the Korean vice president and his 
entourage were not received by his Paraguayan counterpart, Angel 
Roberto Seifart. Vice Presidential Secretary General Victor Hugo 
Pena said the request for a meeting with Seifart was made in 
Seifart's capacity as vice president at a time he was acting 
president because of President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's absence 
from the country. Another source said, however, that the meeting 
did not materialize because our country does not maintain 
diplomatic relations with the DPRK.

  [Text] Three Colombian and one Peruvian drug trafficking 
rings (involving the Cachique Rivera brothers) were using the 
landing strip in "El Diamante" native community in the town of 
Boca del Manu, Madre de Dios Department, when a large 
consignment of drugs was seized on 26 February. 
  The three Colombian "firms" are headed by Colombians known 
as 
"Pablo" or "Pablito," "Caballo," and "Duro." 
  The Peruvian organization is headed by the Cachique Rivera 
brothers. 
  The shipment of 3,653 kg of washed cocaine paste, wrapped in 
75 bags, was seized in the aforementioned location. 
  The drug had been stockpiled in underground "caches" in the 
jungle near the 1,800-meter landing strip of "El Diamante," 
ready to be loaded into small planes bound for Colombia. 
  The route currently used by the Colombian "narcopilots" 
includes Colombia, Brazil, and Peru. Brazilian airspace and the 
city of Cruzeiro, near Ucayali, are used by Colombian mafia 
organizations to ship the drugs to Colombia. 
  The "traffickers" take this route to elude the Yurimaguas 
radar and the possibility of being pursued by the Peruvian Air 
Force T-27 planes that patrol Peruvian airspace in Upper 
Huallaga. 
  Intelligence sources have shown that traffickers have moved 
to areas like Apurimac Department and the jungle edges in 
Ayacucho, Pasco, Cusco, and Madre de Dios Departments because of 
the interdiction activities by the Peruvian forces of order. 
  Traffickers take the drug, which is stockpiled in the 
production areas in Upper Huallaga, Aguaytia, Ucayali, Pozuzo, 
Pichis Palcazu, Oxapampa (Pasco Department) and Palmapampa 
(Ayacucho Department), to shipment areas where it is worth more. 
  Air, land, and river transportation are used to reach the 
shipment "points." 
  From the shipment areas -- one of which was "El Diamante," 
Boca del Manu, in Madre de Dios Department -- the drugs are 
taken to Colombia aboard small Colombian planes. 
  The 13 traffickers detained on 26 February during a combined 
operation were interrogated yesterday by the Counternarcotic 
Division (Dinandro) of the Peruvian National Police.

  [Text] On 3 March, Dr. Daniel Espichan Tumay, special 
prosecutor for terrorist crimes, announced one of the most 
significant desertions from the ranks of Shining Path. During 
the past week, 2,400 persons had surrendered to various military 
units in Leoncio Prado Province (Huanuco Department) during the 
past week in order to seek shelter under the Repentance Law. 
  Dr. Espichan Tumay pointed out that the arrivals at the 
Tingo 
Maria barracks included not only individuals and families, but 
also entire communities who were tired of Shining Path's 
oppression and subjection and decided to surrender. 
  Dr. Espichan Tumay noted that there are now 4,099 repentant 
terrorist nationwide, including this huge contingent. 
  Dr. Espichan Tumay visited the aforementioned area last week 
and personally watched this voluntary surrender of Shining Path 
persons who want to regain their legal status. 
  Dr. Espichan Tumay added: "We are winning the war without 
hurting anyone. The surrender of entire communities is a clear 
demonstration that the Repentance Law is yielding the expected 
results." 
  Dr. Espichan Tumay pointed out that the commission he heads, 
which is evaluating the cases of repentant terrorists, is 
carrying out the appropriate coordination work in order to 
review all these cases. 
  The special prosecutor for terrorist crimes again asked 
judicial branch officials and officials from the Attorney 
General's Office to speed up the paperwork involving repentant 
terrorists.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Augusto Cilloniz Benavides, </F>
president of the Association of Peruvian Agriculturists, by 
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Association of Peruvian Agriculturists (AEA) 
became affiliated with the National Confederation of Private 
Business (Confiep) in November 1993. At that time, it set out to 
improve the basic conditions for establishing a modern 
agricultural sector without limitations on private property or 
investment. Three months later, AEA President Augusto Cilloniz 
Benavides says they already have a membership of 110 
agriculturists. The goal is to enroll some 2,500 (or almost all 
those owning more than 20 hectares). In the midst of this 
process, the agriculturist leader describes the criteria that 
will guide the AEA's activities directed toward working for the 
modernization of infrastructure, investment, education, 
information, and health. The summary of his conversation with EL 
COMERCIO follows. 
<H5>  Lack of Structures </H5>
  In addition to what has been called the problem of Peruvian 
agriculture -- read "financing" -- there is the lack of a 
business structure to coordinate the processes of planting, 
investing, selecting, marketing, and selling. 
  "In the mining and fishing sectors, the Central Peru Mining 
Enterprise, the Peruvian Iron Mines Enterprise, and the State 
Fishmeal and Fish Oil Production Agency remained productive, 
despite being owned by the state. In agriculture, this does not 
apply." 
  Thus Augusto Cilloniz Benavides, president of the 
Association 
of Peruvian Agriculturists, sums up his thoughts on the problems 
of the agricultural sector. 
  According to Cilloniz, the origins of the decline in 
agriculture can be studied, for example, in the experience of 
the sugar mill companies. 
  "They were forced to become cooperatives, and now they do 
not 
have the support for efficient operations," he said. 
  The agriculture leader said that 90 percent of sugar 
production is in the hands of small proprietors who have lost 
the capacity to maintain a business structure. This has resulted 
in the destruction of the irrigation, farm machinery, and 
marketing systems infrastructures, as well as the destruction of 
companies involved in agriculture. 
<H5>  Financing Is a Matter of Real Guarantees </H5>
  [EL COMERCIO] Financing then is not a problem for 
agriculture? 
  [Cilloniz] Yes, it is. But more than financing, the main 
problem is the system of financing and the real guarantees that 
agricultural business offers. 
  In order to exist, credit must be managed with reasonable 
risk. The agriculture sector, with its low levels of 
productivity, its inadequate marketing systems, and its 
health-related problems, is a high-risk sector. 
  Any financial institution, whether it calls itself a 
commercial or development bank, or a rural fund, requires a real 
guarantee by the farmer. It also requires technical support to 
assure the farmer and the bank that the loan will be well 
employed and the risk will be minimum. 
  Cilloniz cites as a useful experience in dealing with the 
problem of guarantees the Joint Responsibility Financing, 
conducted in the Huaral and Canete valleys. This project 
consists of farmers forming associations and contributing to a 
fund of guarantees that enables them to deal with any unforeseen 
circumstances that befall any of the members. 
<H5>  There Are Several Levels of Agriculture </H5>
  There is no single agriculture sector, but rather three 
levels or sublevels with different problems and possibilities. 
  The first is the level attained by export crops, which 
already have an assured market. They generally possess technical 
support provided by the exporting firms. According to Cilloniz, 
these farmers have no "serious problems." 
  The second level is composed of industrial crops whose 
prices 
are quoted on the international commodities markets. Included in 
this category are, for example, coffee, corn, rice, cotton, and 
sorghum. Their principal characteristic is that the demand for 
them is known. 
  If these products are managed in a technically adequate 
manner, the risk is only moderate and they are creditworthy. In 
addition, companies participate in the management, such as those 
that purchase textiles, in the case of cotton, for example. 
  The problems arise at the third level, for peasants in 
subsistence agriculture who grow tomatoes, potatoes, onions, 
garlic, and some of the fruit normally produced for the domestic 
market. In agriculture as in any other productive activity, the 
market should determine the final price. However, the very poor 
condition of wholesale markets prevents that rule from taking 
affect. 
  As a result, the AEA believes it is necessary to complete 
construction of the Santa Anita market, so that farmers will 
have a suitable place to market their products. 
<H3>  The Agrarian Funds Have Only Fulfilled Their Social Welfare 
Role </H3>
  If the problems are concentrated in subsistence agriculture, 
the AEA believes that the Agrarian Funds have been limited to a 
social role. 
  The purpose of the credits extended by the Agrarian Funds 
has 
been purely social. The problem is that there is a very low rate 
of loan repayment and inadequate management of lines of credit. 
  Therefore, AEA proposes that the role of the state be 
intensified in the areas of research and plant disease, as 
investment conditions in agriculture are evident. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Is it good business to invest in agriculture? 
  [Cilloniz] There is no such thing as good or bad business, 
only good and bad businessmen. 
  Cilloniz thus assures us that if a farmer knows how to 
purchase his supplies, sows with the help of technical 
assistance, and negotiates with buyers, and if the marketing 
infrastructure improves, that farmer is certain to get good 
results. 
<H5>  [Box, p B16] </H5>
  "One of the sectors that will grow most in coming years is 
agriculture, basically because we are starting out from a very 
low base, because everything is to be developed anew, and 
because we have rejoined the financial world.... I think we will 
grow even more than Chile, because we have more resources than 
they do," says AEA President Augusto Cilloniz on the future of 
agriculture. 
<H5>  [Box, p B16] </H5>
<H5>  Five Short-Term Proposals </H5>
  The AEA announced that its activities in future years will 
be 
directed toward five principal areas. 
  1. Marketing Systems 
  -- Modernize marketing. 
  -- Standardize packaging and canning. 
  2. Information Systems 
  -- Disseminate systematically all the information already 
available that is needed by farmers, for example, that 
information produced by the Office of Agrarian Information of 
the Ministry of Agriculture. 
  3. Health Measures 
  -- An agreement with the National Agrarian Health System 
and the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation in Agriculture 
to initiate programs leading to the elimination of the "fruit 
fly," the "pink worm," and Aftosa fever, which create obstacles 
to agricultural exports. 
  4. Technical Support for Farmers 
  -- An agreement with the IPAE [Peruvian Institute of 
Business Administration] for the creation of 
agriculture-livestock technical institutes to prepare mid-level 
technicians to participate in agricultural productive processes. 
  5. Investment 
  -- Direct the interest of investors in agriculture so that 
they will establish contact with agricultural businessmen, 
either in associations or as individuals, who produce for export. 
  -- Intensify investment in the production of lemons, 
tangerines, melons, alligator pears, garlic, and onions, for 
export.

<F P=106> [[Editorial by General Manager Luis Miro Quesada G.: "And </F>
Where Is the Democratic Contract?" 
  [Text] If a State governed by law does not exist or the law 
is not observed, if a balance and independence of powers does 
not exist or is not observed, if human rights do not exist or 
are not observed, then governmental democracy does not exist. 
Nor does it exist if the rights of persons are disregarded and 
abused. And that is what is happening today in Peru and what has 
been borne out in the recent "La Cantuta" and "Vaticano" cases. 
  In suddenly passing a law to prevent the "La Cantuta" case 
from being ventilated in the court of original jurisdiction, 
what the CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] has perpetrated 
signifies, to my understanding, that the 5 April 1992 breach of 
constitutionality continues in force, that the CCD is a 
formalism, and that we are continuing under a civil-military 
regime. The responsibility for this, in history, must be borne 
by Mr. Fujimori. 
  Not only the congressmen of the minority but also recognized 
authorities in matters of constitutional law fully agree on the 
legal flaws in the act that was recently passed by the CCD 
majority. Basing my comments on their authoritative opinions, I 
shall refer succinctly to each of these flaws. 
  First, the scandalous and illegal parliamentary procedure 
invoked to pass that law. Scandalous because it was introduced 
suddenly for immediate enactment, without going through 
committee proceedings, and was reported out for promulgation 
without awaiting its enactment, and without even awaiting the 
minority's motion for reconsideration. Illegal because, 
according to the Constitution adopted recently by those same 
congressmen: "Absent an exception stipulated in the By-Laws of 
the Congress, no bill shall be given the force of law without 
having been previously reported out by the Standing Committee 
concerned." I do not know, but it would be absurd were the 
by-laws to contemplate such exception for a law of this 
importance to the country's judicial institution. 
  Second, the intrinsic unconstitutionality of the law that 
was 
passed, in that it was enacted not because of the nature of 
things but specifically to satisfy a special interest in an 
immediate political action. It is public knowledge that, 
following Pease's denunciation in the CCD, the top military 
echelon has been maneuvering to bring the investigation of the 
"La Cantuta" case under the military's special jurisdiction. In 
the view of all the jurists, it is more than evident that the 
case of the La Cantuta massacre does not properly fall within 
the competency of the military tribunals, because it does not 
derive from the military's functions, for it is not credible 
that those functions include the assassination of students. The 
case clearly falls within the competency of the ordinary courts, 
involving as it does the assassination of civilians. And this is 
set forth in the Penal Code. 
  For these reasons, the civil investigating judge, Cubas 
Villanueva, placed an official written request on the military 
tribunal that it transfer the case to the court having original 
jurisdiction. This request, having been refused, produced a 
jurisdictional dispute. As set forth in the law, the solution of 
that dispute devolves upon the Criminal Division of the Supreme 
Court of Justice, and requires four votes in favor of one 
jurisdiction or the other. In executive session, the Criminal 
Division vote was three for the military jurisdiction and two 
for the ordinary jurisdiction, thus requiring under the law that 
another Supreme Court magistrate be called in to cast a vote. At 
this point, however, the Congress stepped in and passed a law 
providing that for the determination of competency only a simple 
majority is required, and stipulating, in an incredible 
aberration, that this provision "is applicable to all 
proceedings presently in course, without requiring new voting." 
Thus, under its true name, it is a law determining that the La 
Cantuta case is to be tried by the military tribunals. 
  Third, the law thus passed is illegal and therefore not 
enforceable, because it cannot replace the provisions of an 
organic law, which is of a higher category and specifies that 
the deciding votes must be four in number. It is contrary to the 
Constitution, in that, according to Article 139, "No authority 
may take over a pending case that is before the courts"--which 
this is--"nor interfere in the exercise of the functions of the 
courts." It is doubly contrary to the Constitution because, 
according to Article 103, "No law has retroactive force nor 
retroactive effect..."; and to stipulate in the new law that it 
is applicable immediately to proceedings in course is to enact a 
retroactive provision. 
  Fourth, and gravest of all, the CCD's action obviously 
constitutes an intolerable intrusion by the Legislative Power 
upon the Judicial Power. As the CAL [Lima Bar Association] has 
aptly put it: "The intrusion by Congress, with a lack of 
conscientiousness that contradicts its constituent nature, and 
contradicts the brand new Constitution of 1993, is inadmissible, 
representing as it does a virtual coup d'etat by the Legislative 
Power against the independence and freedom of the Judicial 
Power." 
  But the Judicial Power could have asserted its freedom and 
independence by disavowing such an aberrant law. And to this 
end, the Supreme Court justices need only have met in Plenary 
Session and declared that they would continue with the procedure 
for defining competency in accordance with the norms set forth 
in the Court's organic law. Lamentably, and despite the public 
outcry, they did not do so; and in an act of submissiveness 
rather than of independence, they again permitted the Judicial 
Power to be trampled under foot, as they did on 5 April. This 
attests to the fact that, in Peru, independence of the Powers is 
nonexistent; that a democratic State governed by law does not 
exist; that, beyond mere formalisms, the Legislative, bowing to 
an Executive dictum, hastens to pass a law that violates the 
very Constitution the Legislative has enacted; and that the 
Judicial hastens to accept it as valid. It is repulsive, but not 
surprising; because the magistrates who voted in favor of 
military competency to prosecute the case-Pantoja, Iberico, and 
Montes de Oca--were appointed during the current regime, as was 
also the current president of the Supreme Court, who throughout 
his term to date, and specifically in this case, has shown an 
absolute lack of a sense of the dignity of the position he 
occupies. 
  Except for the innermost circle of governmental authorities, 
since even the pro-Fujimori group "Renovation" has distanced 
itself, and as I write these lines the rumor persists that 
Ministers Camet and Bustamente have resigned, public rejection 
of that aberrant law by the media as well as by the political 
groupings and opinion makers has been total. Some, not I, hoped 
Fujimori would not take personal responsibility for its 
promulgation, leaving that task to the Congress. But it did not 
happen that way, and following the repeated presence of the 
Commanding General of the Army in the Palace of the Government, 
the promulgation of the law was published last Thursday in EL 
PERUANO. 
  A few months ago, with reference to the La Cantuta 
proceedings, I wrote that the last thing the military would 
permit would be the denying of the military tribunals' 
competency to hear the case. The recent "Vaticano" case, in 
which members of the military are also implicated, and which is 
another example of the trampling of the Judicial Power, provides 
further evidence that the Army exercises a determinative 
policy-making role in the running of the country. 
  To any thinking person, it is obvious that the scandal of 
bringing "Vaticano" to trial as a traitor to the country, thus 
circumventing a public trial, and the recent enactment of this 
aberrant law attacking the integrity of a State governed by law, 
are actions that damage the legal image of Mr. Fujimori's 
government, that damage the possibilities of external aid, and 
that therefore can hardly be believed to have originated in Mr. 
Fujimoro's personal opinion, but rather in pressures being 
applied by the Joint Command of the Armed Forces.

Mario J. Aguerrondo as the military attache at the Uruguayan 
Embassy in Washington. This means he must resign from the 
presidency of the Antarctic Institute. 
  General Luis Abraham is the new Military Household chief. He 
replaces General Manuel Fernandez, who left in mid-1993. 
  Gen. Abraham thus leaves the General Directorate of 
Information for Defense, the intelligence services of the 
Defense Ministry, which was entrusted to a Navy officer in 
February. 
  Colonel Roque Gallego becomes an aide to Defense Minister 
Hugo Martins. 
  Through another resolution, Air Force Brigadier General 
Werner Malates joins the Armed Forces High Court of Promotions 
and Appropriations, replacing Air Force Brigadier General Rafael 
Orique.

  [Excerpts] The Broad Front announced at Shangrila on 9 
March that Montevideo Mayor Tabare Vazquez is the coalition's 
presidential pre-candidate. The party rejected all conditions 
presented by Senator Danilo Astori to accept becoming a 
candidate from the municipal capital. 
  During the meeting held by the leftist coalition party, 
which 
lasted more than six hours, Vazquez finally accepted becoming a 
presidential candidate. His candidacy now will have to be 
confirmed in a Broad Front national meeting. Vazquez explained 
that his remarks, made 48 hours before, about preferring to be 
reelected Montevideo mayor had been misunderstood. 
  After Vazquez accepted becoming a pre-candidate, the Broad 
Front offered Sen. Danilo Astori the possibility of becoming a 
candidate to be Montevideo mayor, with Vazquez' support. 
  Astori answered that he accepted with the condition that he 
be permitted to continue heading a new political group made up 
of legislators and leaders who today are considered independent 
Broad Front followers. 
  Astori's proposal prompted a wave of comments, and even 
though nothing was decided, most representatives of the 12 
factions attending the meeting rejected the proposal with 
similar arguments. One of the most repeated reasons to oppose 
Astori's proposal was the Broad Front tradition forbidding 
double candidacies. In other words, a candidate representing the 
entire coalition cannot, at the same time, appear on the ticket 
of one of the groups participating in the coalition. 
  It was agreed to recess until 16 March in order to give time 
for all groups to independently analyze the issue and define who 
will represent the Front in the race for Montevideo's mayoralty. 
  Sen. Danilo Astori declined to comment when EL PAIS asked 
him 
about the matter at the end of the meeting, adding that he will 
talk with reporters later in the day. He said, however, that he 
does not intend to resign from his plan to work for the creation 
of a new group of independent Broad Front followers. 
  No other names of possible candidates to head Montevideo's 
city hall were mentioned on 9 March in case Astori confirms he 
will not become the candidate. A few days ago, the name of 
Senator Mariano Arana, the Front's 1984 candidate, was mentioned 
in congressional corridors as a possible candidate. At that 
time, however, Arana was an "independent" and did not belong to 
the Artigas Sector, the group that elected him to the Senate. 
  There is a formula circulating among Broad Front leaders 
that 
will be analyzed by the different coalition groups. This formula 
has Tabare Vazquez and Sen. Danilo Astori heading all possible 
tickets. [passage omitted] 
  After announcing the candidacy of Montevideo Mayor Tavare 
Vazquez for the presidency of the Republic, Broad Front leader 
Liber Seregni said the coalition now must "program the 
appropriate electoral campaign." 
  Seregni made this remark in Shangrila (Canelones) after the 
Broad Front provisional executive board meeting that gathered to 
define the issue of candidacies. 
  Regarding the candidate for Montevideo's city hall, Seregni 
said: "We are talking about it. It was proposed..., I proposed 
Sen. Danilo Astori." 
  "We have been talking about the issue and we have been 
listening -- as we appropriately should. Sen. Astori gave us his 
personal opinion on the matter, and we are comparing it with the 
interest of the coalition as a group. We are seeking to 
harmonize Astori's rightful personal wishes with the Broad 
Front's best interests," Seregni said. 
  The Broad Front leader added: "We have been exchanging 
ideas. We have talked about a series of issues and concluded 
that executive board members need to discuss the matter with 
their respective grassroots. We then decided to postpone a 
decision until the 16 March meeting." 
  Before joining the meeting of the so-called "provisional" 
executive board Vazquez said: "It is just one more stage in a 
process that will develop progressively into a satisfactory 
political message, a very positive message for the people." 
  The capital's mayor said the Broad Front already has 
approved 
its reorganization and programmatic platform and is progressing 
in its efforts to achieve a larger electoral coalition with 
other political forces. "The process is proceeding very well; I 
am optimistic," Vazquez said. 
  Meanwhile, Socialist Senator Reinaldo Gargano said the 
recommendation to the highest Broad Front bodies (the plenum and 
the congress) to promote Vazquez's candidacy for the presidency 
of the Republic was approved unanimously and "with cheers." 
  "I think we have taken a very important step because the 
force and attraction of this candidacy goes beyond Broad Front 
borders. It is a proposal that clearly attracts citizens with 
backgrounds not typical of Broad Front followers," the Socialist 
senator said.

  [Excerpt] The Council of Ministers today approved the 
emergency banking law reforms that President Rafael Caldera 
promulgated last week. The reforms authorize the Executive 
Branch to revoke the passports of persons involved in the Banco 
Latino debacle. 
  The reforms, which were approved by the Council of 
Ministers, 
include seven basic points and modify 17 articles. Among the 
most important reforms are the Executive Branch's authority to 
revoke passports; to have control over Fogade [Deposit Guarantee 
Fund] assistance to institutions; to regulate operations related 
to the purchase of Banco Latino's debts; to modify legal 
conditions to encourage the participation of foreign banks in 
the process; and to [word indistinct] the bidding, delayed 
payment, and bankruptcy procedures currently hindering the 
government's action. The reforms also included the stipulation 
that the Supreme Court's political and administrative court has 
to be informed of any amparo proceedings related to the Banco 
Latino case. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Ascension Reyes R.] </F>
  [Excerpts] Consistent with the constitutional norm, 
Comptroller General of the Republic Ramon Escovar Salom has 
submitted the annual report of the operations of the Office of 
the Comptroller General of the Republic to the officers of the 
Congress. He noted on this occasion that during his first year 
in office, he had said that a true state of law had not 
developed in Venezuela and that the citizens remained 
vulnerable, lacking efficient institutions to protect them. 
  He emphasized that while reorganizing his department, 
autonomy for the Office of the Attorney General was achieved, 
and now neither the executive branch, the political parties, nor 
economic pressure groups are able to exert any influence upon it. 
  In connection with the battle against corruption, he said 
that pioneering work was done. The results achieved included the 
prosecution of a president of the Republic in office and his 
consequent removal from government office. In this connection, 
the courts issued about 700 arrest warrants between 1989 and 
1993, and they ordered civil prosecution in cases involving 
crimes against public property amounting to more than a billion 
bolivares. 
  In connection with the Recadi case and the export bonds 
alone, about 6,000 prosecutions were initiated by the Office of 
the Comptroller, and a total of 228 arrest warrants were 
obtained. 
  On this point, this official said that "it is absolutely 
essential to encourage the proper participation on the part of 
each of the sectors and bodies involved in the decisive battle 
being waged against the scourge of corruption. The task is not a 
simple one. It is possible to combat this evil. It can be 
reduced to much smaller dimensions if this problem is approached 
on an integral basis, with sincerity, and with an iron 
determination on the part of all to reduce it." [passage omitted] 
  The defense of human rights as a factor limiting the 
exercise 
of power, and in particular, the civil and political rights 
whose enjoyment and exercise are basic to the survival of the 
state, merit separate consideration. 
  The comptroller general pointed out that defense of the 
civil 
and political rights of the citizens is vital to the maintenance 
of a solid democratic system. 
  He believes that reflection upon the two military uprisings 
in 1992 is necessary, since it has been a consistent requirement 
of the administration that the military authorities allow 
inspectors access to the military penal establishments so that 
they can verify that the human rights of the citizens subject to 
this jurisdiction are being respected. 
  It has been established that there have been violations of 
the laws pertaining to citizens' rights by agents of the various 
police bodies. This official did not fail to note the actions of 
the agents of state security against the journalists 
investigating the origins of these incidents, and it was for 
this reason that he appealed to the MRI [Ministry of the 
Interior] to ensure respect for the right to free information. 
  On the penitentiary issue, it was noted that the level of 
external and internal security at penal establishments has a 
direct effect on the exercise by the inmates of their human 
rights. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Economic Rights </H5>
  It is the opinion of the comptroller general that the Office 
of the Attorney General should be expanded with a view to 
undertaking the defense of the economic rights of the citizens. 
He emphasized that this need has become more obvious in view of 
the government intervention in the Banco Latino. 
  "This shows how basic it is for an institution like the 
Office of the Attorney General to be concerned with the defense 
and oversight of the economic rights of the citizens." 
  The comptroller general warned that the intensity of the 
battle against corruption must be maintained, because in large 
part the progress that has been made has to do with public 
opinion and the role played by the media, since they have joined 
as allies in this struggle. 
  He believes that it is necessary to undertake more profound 
actions to recover the illicit funds that are located outside 
the national territory. These actions should include civil suits 
for the recovery of more than a billion bolivares in order to 
effect restitution for the losses caused to the public assets. 
  This can be done, he said, if the actions and legal 
mechanisms for pursuing investigations abroad are coordinated.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Development Luis Carlos Palacios </F>
by Luis Manuel Escalante; place and date not given] 
  [Text] On the occasion of his investiture as the new 
minister of development by Gustavo Perez Mijares, Dr. Luis 
Carlos Palacios announced that his ministry will immediately 
turn its attention to drafting a new industrial policy. 
  He explained that in this process, there is no intention of 
returning to the past schemes that have now become outdated, 
"but neither can we allow the market to dictate everything." 
  He also announced that his ministry is prepared to undertake 
a review of all of the integration agreements the country has 
signed, with a view to improving those that can be revised, in 
terms of the international relations situation, to the benefit 
of Venezuela. 
  Minister Palacios made these points during his brief address 
following the investiture ceremony and the signing of the 
pertinent record of investiture by Dr. Gustavo Perez Mijares. 
  The outgoing minister mentioned his brief service in the 
Ministry of Development, and he expressed his thanks for the 
support given him by the personnel and the professionals he 
called upon to work with him in what he called "this process of 
transition." 
  He noted that the Ministry of Development is an economic 
ministry, although during his short term of service he gave it 
the social weight it should have. He said he is satisfied with 
the work done. "I am aware that I could have done more, but time 
moves on inexorably." He also admitted that he might have made 
mistakes. "We are all human." But he added that "we have also 
had our successes, and that is the important thing." 
  Following the formal ceremony, which included the swearing 
in 
of Dr. Werner Corrales Leal as the new director general of 
development, Dr. Luis Carlos Palacios met with the group of 
journalists who had attended the transition ceremony. Seated at 
his new desk, he answered their questions cordially. 
  [Escalante] Minister Palacios, what is the nature of this 
new 
industrial policy you have announced? 
  [Palacios] It will be a policy requiring that the action of 
the state be convergent with the action of the market. It should 
not be presumed that the action of the state should be allowed 
to disappear, in the belief that the market will govern 
everything. 
  [Escalante] Wouldn't this be something like establishing 
freedom for the market to function, while at the same time 
imposing norms and controls? 
  [Palacios] Well, there are always norms to which adherence 
is 
necessary. Such exist in every institution. Markets can exist 
because the institutions exist, and the economic agents must 
conform to their rules and restrictions. 
  [Escalante] What kind of support would this new industrial 
policy give the manufacturing sector, with a view to its 
development? 
  [Palacios] You see, the main idea is to encourage growth 
from 
the inside out. In addition, this growth must be convergent with 
all of the other factors in the economy, and, naturally, the 
sectorial aspect must be taken into account. Both the industrial 
policies and the specific sectorial aspects must be oriented 
toward a single goal, which is the development of the country. 
In this connection, industry, because of its ability to promote 
and link the technological advances and innovations with the 
increase in productivity, will obviously play a key role in 
Venezuela. 
  Palacios then went on to note that Venezuela is an 
oil-producing country. A large part of the national income comes 
from this product, but its capacity to generate jobs stands at a 
mere 1 percent in relation to the other sources of jobs. "For 
this reason, we have to realize that oil is not everything." 
  In view of this circumstance, he warned that "any country 
looking toward the 21st century must base its development on the 
strengthening of its industrial sector, making use of its 
comparative advantages and developing its competitive 
advantages." 
  [Escalante] Does this growth from the inside out involve a 
revision of the current customs system and the establishment of 
some measures to protect certain areas? 
  [Palacios] While continuing to respect the international 
agreements signed, we will review all of the integration 
agreements, in an effort to ensure that our participation in 
international trade is participation that truly promotes 
development, rather than merely a naive and indiscriminate 
involvement. 
  [Escalante] This will be done with regard to the existing 
agreements with Central America and the Caribbean? 
  [Palacios] With all of them. 
  [Escalante] Including the Andean Pact? 
  [Palacios] Including the Andean Pact, of course. 
  [Escalante] What will be done where the mechanisms already 
established in the country to combat antidumping measures and 
subsidies are concerned? 
  [Palacios] All of the existing tools, and how they mesh with 
the needs, will be reviewed in order to enable us to draft an 
efficient industrial policy. 
  Minister Palacios made it clear that it is very likely that 
this policy will be ready by 1995, and that "the role of the 
government will be to present it to the country." 
  "The industrial policy we will implement will be that which 
the country produces." 
  [Escalante] On the level of the consumer public, could this 
new industrial policy mean an increase in the basic market 
basket and in controlled prices? 
  [Palacios] In his address, President Caldera appealed for 
compromise and solidarity. In economic policy, this could be 
reflected in an effort to achieve a price agreement, so as to be 
able to eliminate the inflationary inertia without causing 
supply problems or sudden rises in prices. 
  [Escalante] Will there be a specific policy for small and 
average industries? 
  [Palacios] The new industrial policy that will be presented 
to the country will include special treatment for small and 
average industries, as Dr. Caldera indicated in his address. 
  In conclusion, Luis Carlos Palacios, the new minister of 
development, said that "this will also mean seeking some 
convergence with the financial sector, in order to resolve the 
problems of financing and reorganizing the state bodies that are 
involved with this issue."

<F P=106> [Article by Mariela Leon] </F>
  [Excerpts] Puerto Ordaz, 3 February--Despite the 
substantial increase in world consumption of aluminum, which is 
estimated at 3 percent for 1994 and 1995, and the production 
adjustments agreed upon by the main producers on the 
international level, there are no prospects for the 
reestablishment of a balance between supply and demand in a 
period of less than two years. 
  In her opening address at the First National Aluminum Sector 
Seminar on Potential and Opportunity, held in this city, 
Marielena Posada, the president of CVG [Venezuelan Corporation 
of Guayana]-Bauxilum (the result of the merger of Bauxiven and 
Interalumina), outlined the local and international situation of 
the sector. 
  On the world level, the aluminum industry is facing a 
difficult situation. It is the result of the continued price 
decline that began in 1989 and the great increase in the 
inventory levels resulting from reduced consumption in America 
and Europe, which was accompanied by substantial increases in 
production in the Western world during the same period." 
  Posada said that the situation in the Eastern part of the 
world is no different, since while a decrease can indeed be seen 
in production, it is not by any means as great as the decline in 
consumption. This situation has had an even greater impact on 
the industry because of the inclusion of the metal from the 
Community of Independent States (the former Soviet Union) on the 
international markets, to a great extent reflecting the changes 
that have come about in the war-materiel industry on the 
international level as a result of the political events of 
recent years. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Reducing Costs: The Goal </H5>
  The president of Bauxilum commented that in addition to the 
effects of low prices, this Venezuelan industry has been 
affected in recent years by low levels of productivity, high 
production costs, a high level of indebtedness, and a critical 
cash situation. 
  A review of the situation of the aluminum sector of CVG in 
1993, she said, makes a realistic view of the situation possible 
on the level of the basic sector of the industry. 
  The results of such a review reveal an industry in crisis, 
in 
which an encouraging recovery process began in the second half 
of the year. This was evident from the very major reduction in 
total production costs, which declined from $1,460 per ton in 
the month of July to $1,120 per ton at the end of the year, 
clearly revealing the potential this business enjoys, she noted. 
  "The existence of an integrated complex for the production 
of 
aluminum, which was consolidated with the incorporation of 
Bauxiven as a processor of bauxite on entirely competitive 
terms, and with excellent results in the Interalumina operation; 
the undeniable energy advantages that are available in Guayana; 
and the capacity for response that has been evidenced by the 
aluminum people, leading to a change in the trend in the 
development of the business to which we referred previously, 
constitute a firm foundation for the future consolidation of the 
Venezuelan aluminum industry. 
  Posada maintained that we will reach the goal of producing 
at 
a total cost of less than $1,000 per ton in 1994. Our forecasts 
show that we will have reduced the cost to less than $900 per 
ton by 1996. 
  "This will make us one of the most competitive complexes in 
the world. Our goal, therefore, is to achieve world leadership 
in the production of aluminum." 
<H5>  Second Phase </H5>
  On being asked about the future of ALCASA [Caroni Aluminum, 
Inc.] in the short run, this official explained that at that 
aluminum enterprise, "advances are being made in the 
privatization process. The alternative that is gaining support 
involves the massive and immediate incorporation of the private 
capital obtained in the first phase, through the negotiation of 
the Guacara reducing plant, by means of affiliation with the 
national bank. 
  "The second phase, involving the reduction plant in Puerto 
Ordaz, is still pending. Work is being done in the CVG on the 
problem of saving ALCASA, and privatization is one of the 
solutions being considered." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The disarmament of the 3-80 Northern Front, 
which was scheduled to start on 17 March, has been rescheduled 
for next week. The government and 3-80 Northern Front 
commissions continue to work on establishing programs to 
reintegrate the demobilized men into civilian society. 
Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta said that the group will 
be fully disarmed by 8 April. 
  The government commission headed by Minister Mendieta and 
members of the 3-80 Front met and decided to postpone the 
disarmament until next week. 
  [Begin Mendieta recording, in progress] ...we decided not to 
implement the disarmament today and to postpone it until next 
week. Meanwhile, we will continue the reintegration process. 
Everything is normal and as planned. We hope that there will 
be no major delays and that this process will irreversibly 
progress. [end recording] 
  There will be a number of meetings to assess the work of the 
commissions and the programs to reintegrate the 3-80 Northern 
Front. Minister Mendieta said that members of this group are 
willing to accept loans to buy land. The government, he added, 
will offer them financing and advice. [passage omitted]

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections 
scheduled for 8 May 1994. 
  Ruben Blades, Papa Egoro Party presidential candidate, met 
with Colon Free Zone businessmen and merchants to exchange ideas 
and hear suggestions on the future of that free zone. Blades 
proposed holding a referendum in October for a Constituent 
Assembly to reform the current Constitution which he said is not 
fitting for the nation's future and much less for the 21st 
century. (Panama City Telemetro Television Network in Spanish 
1730 GMT 11 Mar 94) 
  Blades, during a debate organized by the Panamanian 
Ecumenical Committee on 14 March, proposed "a moratorium on the 
payment of the foreign debt in order to give a solution to the 
serious social problems that the vast majority are 
experiencing." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 16 
Mar p 1) 
  Ruben Dario Carles, "Change 94" ticket presidential 
candidate 
and former comptroller general, said during a debate organized 
by the Panamanian Ecumenical Committee on 14 March that he "had 
nothing to do with the foreign debt" payment to international 
financial institutions. Carles' remarks that the U.S. operation 
in Panama had not been an "invasion," rather a "liberation," was 
rejected by other party members and sympathizers while he called 
the audience present at the debate "ignorant" on these two 
issues: the foreign debt and the U.S. invasion. (Panama City LA 
ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 16 Mar p 1) 
  Carles on 14 March visited San Miguelito District where he 
heard expressions of general discontent from the residents. 
Carles has stepped up his political campaign not only in the 
capital but also in the countryside. On his visit last week to 
Veraguas Province, he said: "I had the opportunity to reiterate 
what I had said was a fundamental matter in that sector: a 
reforestation program as well as the development of a tourist 
site on Montijo Gulf." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in 
Spanish 2300 GMT 14 Mar 94) 
  Carles reiterated on 15 March in San Miguelito District that 
he will solve the public services problems in 100 days. "I have 
been able to confirm that the basic problem of these urban and 
suburban areas is the lack of jobs -- which we will generate -- 
and the deficiency in public services. In the first 100 days of 
my administration these will be improved," Carles noted. (Panama 
City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 15 Mar 94) 
  Samuel Lewis Galindo, National Consensus Alliance 
presidential candidate, called for nonviolence in the campaign. 
"The presidential candidates and the party leaders favor that 
the political campaign be conducted within certain levels and 
certain bounds so violent passions are not unleashed. I am 
certain that this is the position of the seven presidential 
candidates. It goes without saying that there are small groups 
that commit censurable actions, however there is still time to 
halt them," Lewis Galindo noted. (Panama City Telemetro 
Television Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 11 Mar 94) 
  Lewis Galindo went on the campaign trail to diverse towns in 
Cocle Province, taking the message of change to the residents. 
He also visited some residential areas of El Cristo where he 
was warmly received. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in 
Spanish 2300 GMT 14 Mar 94) 
  Lewis Galindo said Panama currently has a foreign debt 
larger 
than the one it had on 20 December 1989. Lewis Galindo added 
that the current negotiators of that debt do not want to 
recognize their responsibilities and the errors they made and 
that there is no such Economic Plan. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE 
PANAMA in Spanish 16 Mar p 1) 
  Lewis Galindo, while visiting residents in the poor Boca La 
Caja neighborhood, promised to make an all-out effort during his 
administration to generate jobs and improve living conditions. 
"In these poor neighborhoods we want to create an emergency 
plan that will give jobs to 50,000 Panamanians, to improve -- in 
these same neighborhoods -- the social conditions of so many 
people," Lewis Galindo said. (Panama City Circuito RPC 
Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 10 Mar 94) 
  Mireya Gruber, Arnulfist Party, PA, presidential candidate, 
said she was not able yesterday to attend the renewal of the 
electoral ethical commitment because she was on the campaign 
trail. "I arrived at home at 2300, and this is why I did not 
attend. However, our candidates did," Mireya Gruber noted. "We 
will respect our commitment." (Panama City Circuito RPC 
Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 10 Mar 94) 
  PA party members held a Democratic Alliance dinner in favor 
of the 8 May elections and in honor of candidate Mireya Gruber. 
PA and Liberal Party personalities attended the dinner led by 
Mireya Gruber. During her speech Gruber made reference to 
diverse points of her government platform; among these 
employment, sports, and housing. (Panama City Circuito RPC 
Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Mar 94) 
  Gruber over the weekend participated in a three-day tour of 
Chiriqui Province, reaffirming her promise to keep in touch with 
the people. Our government will be for all Panamanians, said 
Mireya Gruber, indicating that health, education, employment, 
and housing problems will have top priority in her 
administration. Gruber also urged the younger generation to 
stay away from drugs. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in 
Spanish 2300 GMT 14 Mar 94) 
  Gruber said she will file formal charges against the PRD 
with 
the Justice and Peace Commission for attacking her in Chiriqui. 
The PRD publicly rejected the attack by one of its party 
members. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 
GMT 15 Mar 94) 
  Ernesto Perez Balladares, Democratic Revolutionary Party, 
PRD, presidential candidate, announced yesterday during a Rotary 
Club meeting possible changes to the Labor Code, should he win 
the coming elections. He urged the United States to make clear 
whether it has any intention of keeping a military presence in 
Panama after the year 2000. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in 
Spanish 16 Mar p 1) 
  Eduardo Vallarino, Christian Democratic Party, PDC, 
presidential candidate, said during a debate organized by the 
Panamanian Ecumenical Committee on 14 March that one of his 
government program's top priorities is "to postpone payment of 
the foreign debt." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 
16 Mar p 1)

  [Text] The German Government announced on 15 March in 
Port-au-Prince the temporary closing of its embassy in Haiti as 
of 31 March and the recall of its accredited diplomats. In a 
communique published in the Haitian capital, Bonn explained its 
decision as a consequence of the serious economic and political 
crisis resulting from the 30 September 1991 coup d'etat. The 
foreign representations in Port-au-Prince have been obliged to 
buy fuel at a very high cost on the black market for several 
months. Some neighborhoods in the capital have electricity only 
three hours a day. Bonn deems this necessary closing regrettable 
because of the traditional friendship and excellent cooperation 
between the two countries in the past. 
  While pointing out that humanitarian aid will be maintained 
as long as possible through nongovernmental organizations and 
churches, the German Government advises that financial and 
technical cooperation remains suspended. The consular tasks 
[word indistinct] of the Port-au-Prince embassy will henceforth 
be performed by the General Consulate of the Federal Republic of 
Germany in Florida, the communique adds.

  [Text] Brazil is the newest OECD member. Joining the OECD 
enables Brazil to move closer to the organization that groups 
together the 24 most-industrialized countries in the world. The 
exchange of letters formalizing Brazil's joining of the OECD 
will take place on either 16 or 17 March during the meeting to 
be held between Itamaraty Secretary General Roberto Abdenur and 
OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye at the Hotel de La 
Muette. 
  Brazilian Ambassador to France Carlos Alberto Leite Barbosa 
has been furthering Brazil's rapprochement with the OECD for two 
years. The organization has no members from Latin America except 
for Mexico, which will become the 25th member of OECD as of June 
under the aegis of the United States and Canada. The first 
stage to be completed in order to achieve full-member status is 
to sit on the Development Assistance Committee. Brazil will sit 
there next to countries like Argentina and the ROK. 
  The OECD is a sort of exclusive club, whose members are the 
richest countries in the world, that promotes greater 
cooperation and a broad exchange of information on economic and 
development matters. The center was created by an OECD council 
decision. Its mission is to embark on research on international 
economic relations, suggest solutions to overcome problems 
identified in research, and establish a dialogue with developed 
countries. Members are Germany, Australia, Austria, Belgium, 
Canada, Denmark, Spain, the United States, Finland, France, 
Great Britain, Greece, the Netherlands, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, 
Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and Turkey. 
<H5>  Seminar </H5>
  The first consequence of Brazilian participation will be the 
OECD's organization of an international seminar on privatization 
at the Hotel Mofarrej in Sao Paulo during April. The most 
important members, with some experience in privatizations, will 
attend the seminar. At the same time, Ambassador Rubens Barbosa 
is coordinating a seminar on the privatization process in Brazil 
in London next week with the participation of Brazilian 
economists, Persio Arida among them.

<F P=106> ["Address to the nation" by Ecuadoran President Sixto </F>
Duran-Ballen in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] Fellow citizens: I am addressing you from Tokyo. I 
have taken a break from my activities during my official visit 
to Japan to refer to an event that I believe sets a very serious 
precedent for the country: the arbitrary decision made by the 
Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] to declare the summons to a 
referendum inadmissible. Article 79, Paragraph O of the 
Constitution unequivocally and precisely establishes the 
president's unquestionable right to summon a popular referendum 
to decide issues that he believes are of extreme importance to 
the state. Removed -- as has always been my case -- from any 
sort of political, personal, or party interest, I decided to 
call a referendum so we can discuss, for the first time, various 
topics of great national importance. My intention was and 
continues to be for the Ecuadoran people, all fellow citizens, 
to directly and sovereignly express an opinion and decide how 
our country should be, how the Ecuador we desire for our 
children should be. 
  Nevertheless, the unconstitutional and surprising TSE 
attitude, which cannot legally disqualify my summons, attempts 
to hush the people's supreme voice -- our voice -- through an 
illegal act. 
  On what legal precedence does the TSE interpret the 
Constitution and state that my summons to a referendum is 
unconstitutional? The TSE's decision is absurd, and I denounce 
and reject it. The decision dangerously challenges the essence 
of democracy. In fact, it keeps the people from directly 
participating in the country's political life and from deciding 
on its resources and alternatives. 
  How much longer must our country witness the repeated and 
useless power struggles? What dark agreements and last-minute 
arrangements will the legislative majorities make to resolve 
their fierce disputes for control of the basic institutions that 
are required to strengthen and improve our democratic life and 
to ensure the thorough development of our people? 
  The time has come to change and respect the people's right 
to 
express themselves on significant national issues. Thus, with 
great firmness, the president of the Republic and the national 
government will not falter in their efforts to carry out this 
legitimate referendum. Based on our democratic discipline and 
with due respect for the Constitution and the laws of the 
country, I have instructed the vice president of the Republic, 
as acting president, and my government to resort to legal 
measures to see that my constitutional right to consult the 
people and the people's inalienable authority to express 
themselves on the most important national problems be respected. 
Any attempt to negate my and the Ecuadoreans' rights is a 
serious mistake that will have a negative effect on the very 
nature of our democracy. 
  I call all of you to join efforts so that we can defend our 
rights together. I call on you to join us in defense of the 
democracy we want to maintain and protect in our country.

  [Text] 15 March 1994 
  To the Mexican people, the world's peoples and governments, 
the national and international media, brothers: 
  The Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee-General 
Command [CCRI-CG] of the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation 
Army] addresses all of you with respect and honor. 
  First -- The Federal Government, which usurped the people's 
will yesterday, is again lying about the dialogue in San 
Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. The bad government claims that 
"agreements" were reached when there was only dialogue. The 
powerful usurped the truth, and they are trying to deceive the 
people by saying that peace is only a matter of a signature. 
  Second -- There are attempts to forget the main reasons that 
provoked our uprising by replacing the truth of a dialogue with 
the lie of an "agreement." The CCRI-CG of the EZLN has made no 
deal with the Federal Government and has negotiated nothing 
other than the way in which the dialogue is taking place. 
Moreover, it has not reached any agreement with the bad 
government that has been lying for so long. 
  Third -- The CCRI-CG of the EZLN points out that concluding 
the first phase of the dialogue with lies is the best way to 
make peace fail. We cannot trust a government that lies, even 
to make proposals. If the supreme government wishes to present 
the San Cristobal document as "agreements," then let the list of 
EZLN demands be the "agreement" and let democracy be guaranteed 
in the upcoming elections with the resignation of the federal 
executive. 
  Fourth -- The CCRI-CG of the EZLN respectfully urges the 
honest national and international media not to play into the 
crooked game of the usurper and to report, truthfully and 
objectively, what is happening in the current phase of the 
dialogue. 
  Liberty! Justice! Democracy! Respectfully yours from the 
Mexican Southeast. 
  [Signed] CCRI-CG of the EZLN 
  [Dated] Mexico City, March 1994

<F P=106> [Interview with Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate </F>
for the Mexican Democratic Revolutionary Party, by Roberto 
Lameirinhas -- place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Lameirinhas] What is your opinion of the Zapatist 
uprising on 1 January in Chiapas State? 
  [Cardenas] The Zapatist National Liberation Army made people 
aware of the predatory system of unfairness and discrimination 
that the indigenous communities have endured for centuries. It 
also revealed that, from the socioeconomic viewpoint, the 
neoliberal and technocratic schemes were unfeasible, as well as 
the unpostponable need to end the current state party role 
played by the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], which has 
been corrupt, antipatriotic, and arbitrary. The uprising 
revealed the existence of an obsolete and anachronistic regime. 
It also showed an unpopular and isolated president (Salinas de 
Gortari) who is aware of his illegitimate origin, who went from 
a state of inaction to a state of meaningless and useless 
action. The uprising awoke Mexican awareness. It is an 
extremely painful experience due to the people who died, the 
wounds it caused to the country's society, the abuses committed. 
The executions, the common graves, the cases of torture could 
have and should have been avoided by the government by means of 
political leadership aware of its current and future military 
and human duties. 
  [Lameirinhas] Did the demonstrations in Mexico City 
demanding equal electoral and political opportunities by any 
means spark the Chiapas uprising? 
  [Cardenas] The Chiapas uprising took place within a context 
in which civilian society had been demanding, for the past five 
years, a transition toward democracy and political reform. We 
have asserted that the lack of political reforms and reliable 
elections under Salinas' regime is unsustainable. These 
demands, repeatedly made by the Mexican Armed Forces, are what 
had been heard since the 1 January uprising. 
  [Lameirinhas] What is your party's stance regarding the 
uprising? 
  [Cardenas] We want a peaceful, rewarding, and fair solution 
for Chiapas, that is, a deep-rooted reform. We understand the 
reasons that drove the indigenous communities to despair. They 
were trapped by a deaf, blind, and despotic regime. Moreover, 
we have effectively participated in the peaceful rebellion of 
civilian society, which reasserted its choice for peace and 
democracy and, at the same time, saved lives and avoided bigger 
problems by getting the government to call a cease-fire and 
start peace negotiations in the Chiapas region. The solutions 
to the Chiapas problem have a national and foreign component. 
It would be a mistake and risky to separate one from the other. 
The local solution demands structural changes strongly linked 
to the state and the region. This is not possible without 
affecting unjust and illegitimate interests that have existed 
for years. The communities must recover their rights and 
assets. An exhaustive land reform is necessary, and the power 
structure of the "bosses" must be changed so the people can have 
the possibility of electing their own authorities. Moreover, 
the great deficiencies in education, health, housing, and 
highway services must be solved. Job opportunities and greater 
equity in the trading of local products must be granted. The 
privileges of large landowners must be eliminated. We favor 
contributing to all forms of mobilization of the indigenous 
groups and society in order to eliminate racism and the 
depredation of natural resources. 
  [Lameirinhas] What does your party think about NAFTA? 
  [Cardenas] I want to make it clear that the PRD is not 
against Mexico engaging in competition with the world market and 
its participation in NAFTA. But it should be pointed out that 
we need to assess the great impact this opening will have on the 
agricultural sector and other productive sectors, especially the 
micro, small, and medium enterprises that were not included in 
the negotiations. We now must work on adapting to the new terms 
of competition. 
  [Lameirinhas] The latest polls show you as the second most 
popular candidate. Are these figures reliable? 
  [Cardenas] Polls in Mexico have never been very reliable 
and, in the past, have been subject to manipulation. We also 
have seen that people automatically answer that they will vote 
for the official party in order to protect themselves from 
possible retaliation by a repressive and authoritarian political 
regime. 
  [Lameirinhas] Are there any chances of fraud in the August 
elections? 
  [Cardenas] In order to guarantee the authenticity of the 
elections, Congress must amend the 1990, '92, and '93 
constitutional amendments that greatly distort the people's 
choices. The PRD submitted a report on the 1994 electoral 
process to the Federal Elections Institute General Council. The 
report refers to the illegal aspects of the process based on: 
first, discretionary control exercised by the government and 
the PRI on the electoral organizations; second, control over the 
right to vote through the partial manipulation of the voters 
lists and registration of voters; third, unfair distribution and 
discriminating control over resources supplied by the government 
to the political parties; fourth, unfair access by opposition 
parties and the PRI to the mass media, especially television; 
and fifth, supervision of the electoral process, during all its 
phases, by PRI and government authorities.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Why Should Peru Be Punished"] </F>
  [Text] When Alberto Fujimori assumed the Peruvian 
presidency in 1990, he inherited a devastating war with a 
bloodthirsty guerrilla group -- the Shining Path -- which 
claimed the lives of 20,000 persons and cost $20 billion. The 
Peruvian economy had shrunk by an amazing 20 percent during the 
two previous years and inflation was running at 7,000 percent. 
A U.S. company that specializes in risk analysis rated Peru as 
the most dangerous place in the world to do business. 
  Over a span of less than four years, President Fujimori has 
managed to overcome formidable obstacles. His government has 
dealt such a heavy blow to the Shining Path that many Peruvians 
who had to emigrate -- and even some tourists -- are returning 
to what used to be battlefields. Fujimori's free trade policy 
has curbed inflation and turned our country into the fastest 
growing economy in the Americas. It is hardly surprising that 
he now enjoys overwhelming popularity among his fellow 
countrymen. 
  Despite all this, Fujimori has been unable to achieve one 
crucial victory -- to be accepted by the U.S. Government. Some 
U.S. officials say Fujimori's achievements will always be 
stained by the harsh tactics he used to redress that state of 
affairs. In April 1992, President Fujimori dissolved Congress, 
suspended the Constitution, and took almost total control of the 
country on the grounds that this was the only way to prevent the 
savage Shining Path from seizing power and to end dilatory 
tactics in the Peruvian Congress which thwarted the economic 
reform. Peruvians applauded Fujimori's decision to wage a war 
against the guerrillas and to undertake economic reforms. 
  The United States, however, condemned his actions and 
suspended its economic aid even though Fujimori kept his promise 
of holding Parliamentary elections to draft a new Constitution. 
Human rights associations and leftist groups displayed more 
concern about this than about the suffering of the Peruvian 
people when their lives were at the mercy of Shining Path 
terrorists -- at the mercy of whom they still are to a certain 
extent because the Shining Path killed 750 people last year. 
U.S. Congress leaders and President Clinton contend that it is 
impossible to settle the issue of U.S. economic aid to Peru 
unless Fujimori takes additional steps to strengthen the 
democratic process and to improve respect for human rights in 
Peru. 
  Nevertheless, the Clinton administration does not consider 
democracy to be a top priority when dealing with countries that 
are more strategically important. Washington openly endorsed 
Yeltsin when he dissolved the Russian Parliament last year. 
Fujimori argues that Yeltsin undoubtedly drew his inspiration 
from Peru and that Russian intelligence services consulted their 
Peruvian counterparts before Yeltsin's action. 
  Private investors have already reached their own conclusions 
concerning Peru and are expeditiously acting to support our 
country through their investments because it offers so many 
possibilities, is making headway to consolidate its stability, 
and its president enjoys enormous popularity at home. 
  It is high time for the Clinton administration to give up 
its 
hypocritical and moralistic attitude, which it readily overlooks 
whenever interests dictate, and to resume its economic aid to 
Peru.

<F P=106> [Article by Javier Ignacio Mayorca] </F>
  [Text] This week, the Congress will begin to take up the 
challenge of revising the Constitution of the nation. In this 
connection, a group of jurists made up of Jose Guillermo 
Andueza, Ricardo Combellas, and Tulio Alvarez have completed the 
drafting of the document containing the proposals pertinent to 
this effort that will be set forth by the National Convergence 
spokesmen. 
  It appears that this effort will be plagued by obstacles. 
There are sectors in Congress that belong to various political 
movements and that favor beginning the discussions on 
constitutional reform again, from the zero mark. This would 
involve setting aside four years of work carried out by the 
Bicameral Commission, over which Rafael Caldera, the 
president-elect, presided. 
  The Convergence, for its part, wants a new Constitution 
approved this year. To this end, Jose Guillermo Andueza will 
meet at 1100 this morning with the board of the Supreme Court of 
Justice to analyze possible changes in the judicial branch. 
  The strategy involves launching a discussion with all 
sectors 
in the country as soon as possible and maintaining the idea that 
the work of many years should not be jettisoned simply because 
sectors interested in blocking the "initiatives for change" 
might exist. 
  The document in question is entitled "Proposed 
Constitutional 
Reform (comments on the proposal approved by the Senate on first 
discussion)." It is 44 pages long and, as was to be expected, it 
deals with many aspects. The most novel were chosen for the 
purposes of this article. 
  The editorial commission agreed that the four types of 
referendum, or direct vote by the citizens on specific 
proposals, should be maintained. They are the approbatory, 
abrogative, consultative, and revocatory forms. 
  According to the document, the initiative for the 
convocation 
of an approbatory referendum should come from the majority of 
the members of one of the legislative chambers, "and not while 
they are meeting in joint session." 
  Also, reconsideration of the Senate proposal according to 
which this form could also be used when 5 percent of the 
electors in each body so desire was recommended. This was not, 
however, set forth as an alternate proposal. 
  Where the revocatory referendum on members of the executive 
branch designated prior to election is concerned, the document 
deems it desirable that the requirement for convocation be 
reduced. That requirement is currently estimated at 15 percent 
of the registered electors, "and its effects on revocation of 
the mandate when more than 50 percent have cast negative votes." 
  The document also proposes that the authority of such a 
referendum be extended to include the dissolution of the 
Congress as a whole, rather than just its members considered 
individually." 
  Concerning the abrogative referendum for revoking laws, the 
document urges "reconsideration of the Senate proposal to limit 
the time allowed for convocation to the six months following 
approval of the law." There were no comments made on the 
proposal regarding the advisory referendum. 
  With the Convergence version of a new constitution, not only 
would it be possible to dissolve the parliament through an 
electoral method, but the president of the Republic could also 
dissolve it, as suggested by Francisco Eguiogunen, the Peruvian 
treatise writer. 
  On this basis, if the chief of state had to deal with an 
adverse parliament, he could order it dissolved and could 
immediately convoke new elections. 
  If the balance of forces should fail to change, the 
executive 
branch would then find itself under interdiction and would have 
to be replaced. If, on the contrary, votes favorable to the 
government party were obtained, this would be interpreted as 
popular support of the executive administration. 
  On the state level, the norm would be modified, since 
according to the document, the legislative assemblies could only 
be dissolved if the people were to approve the governor's 
administration, after the legislature itself had rejected the 
reports and statements. This represents an effort to establish a 
mechanism for exerting control over possible "political 
excesses." 
  The document of the Andueza-Combellas-Alvarez commission 
expresses the belief that "the complexity of government 
functions has made it necessary to rethink the possibility of 
establishing the position of prime minister" in order to assist 
the president in the task of coordinating the work of the 
executive branch. 
  The duties of this official would include the following, 
among others: to propose the appointment and removal of cabinet 
members; to coordinate the national plans with those of the 
states and municipalities; to receive the accounting reports of 
the ministers; and to take responsibility for the relations 
between the executive and legislative branches. 
  According to recommendations of this document, the prime 
minister could be removed by presidential decision, or after 
approval of a censure motion by at least three-fifths of the 
members of the Chamber of Deputies. This would entail, in 
addition, the resignation of the entire cabinet. 
  Because of space limitations, other aspects dealt with in 
the 
document (elimination of the Judicature Council, reestablishment 
of the contracts of national interest, creation of frontier 
zones, etc.) could not be included in this article. The debate 
is just beginning, however, and the plan that emerges from it 
will have to be submitted to the people for approval, on a basis 
similar to the Guatemalan experience last Sunday.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota--In the first week of August 
1993, the prosecutor general met in his office with the members 
of the law firm Ristaud &amp; Abbel, who claimed to represent an 
organization of some 60 drug traffickers from the Valle del 
Cauca. Gustavo de Greiff told EL ESPECTADOR yesterday that "they 
came to be instructed on the rules for drug-trafficker 
surrenders, and I explained to them the entire legal framework 
of the policy on surrendering to justice authorities." One of 
them, Abbel, had been a high-ranking official of the U.S. 
Justice Department, in the very section that handles 
applications for extradition from Latin American countries. 
  Romulo Gomez, a Cali attorney, and Juan Fernandez 
Carrasquilla, a former magistrate from Bogota, visited the 
prosecutor general later on to give him the details of a formal 
proposal for the drug traffickers of the Valle del Cauca to turn 
themselves in. They made it clear that formally, they were only 
representing Gilberto Rodriguez O. and Julio Fabio Urdinola G., 
but that soon news would be received regarding other 
"colleagues." 
  "They mentioned that the Rodriguez Orejuela's had been 
cooperating with the authorities in the war against the Medellin 
Cartel, and that they had supplied data and information that 
helped the authorities in their fight against Pablo Escobar 
Gaviria. They wanted that to be taken into consideration," said 
the prosecutor general yesterday. 
  But when these contacts were made public, the inmates in the 
Itagui Prison, led by Roberto Escobar Gaviria, also sent the 
Prosecutor General's Office a letter naming the alleged members 
of the Pepes (Persecuted by Pablo Escobar) Group and demanding a 
judicial investigation of them. The prosecutor general responded 
that an offender's cooperation could only be taken into 
consideration after he turned himself in, not before, and the 
attorneys did not call back. 
<H5>  Neither Pepes Nor Jail </H5>
  But in late 1993, after Pablo Escobar's demise, there was 
talk in Cali of a plan for the "staggered surrender" of 200 
major drug traffickers, in which each would benefit by providing 
information on the next person to turn himself in. 
  At present, Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez has 
acknowledged 
to EL ESPECTADOR in an interview, there is only one indictment 
against Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela from a U.S. court and none 
arising out of Colombian investigations, so the most important 
thing is for him to confess when he surrenders so that the 
American case will not be pursued. 
  Although Rodriguez Orejuela's and Julio Fabio Urdinola's 
attorneys insist that their "cooperation" in the search for 
Escobar should be recognized, they deny any ties with the Pepes 
and their organization to commit crimes through a cartel. 
  "With regard to that alleged organization (Pepes)," said De 
Greiff, "the Prosecutor General's Office and the Attorney 
General's Office have pursued many investigations, but there 
have been no witnesses or documentary evidence to allow us to 
identify its members individually." 
  While the letter bomb that practically blew up in Roberto 
Escobar's face confirmed the Pepes' threats, a letter in which 
Carlos Mario Alzate ("El Arete" [earring]) asked the director of 
prisons not to take him out of his maximum-security cell at La 
Picota even for judicial proceedings revealed the panic that 
this group's actions have instilled in members of Escobar's 
organization. 
<H5>  New Contacts </H5>
  In open letters sent by Roberto Escobar from his cell to the 
Prosecutor General's Office, two of the people accused of 
belonging to the Pepes, plus one other person, met with Gustavo 
de Greiff in his office on 14 January. He gave them 
documentation attesting that no summons had been issued in their 
names and that they were the subject of investigations to 
determine their involvement in certain interrogations, pursuant 
to Article 369E of the new Code of Criminal Procedure, through 
which they had managed to mislead the authorities in a drug 
enforcement operation in the Valle del Cauca and evade capture. 
  Although various witnesses interviewed this week by EL 
ESPECTADOR confirmed that the head of the Drug Trafficking Unit 
of the Prosecutor General's Office, Cruz Helena Aguilar 
Echeverri, last Monday mediated a "peace pact" between two men 
close to the late chief of the Medellin Cartel and Luis 
Guillermo Angel, an alleged middleman for the "Cali people," De 
Greiff emphatically declared that "the Prosecutor General's 
Office did not, does not, and will not have any involvement, 
either institutional or private, in any agreement between 
criminal organizations." 
  "What happened there," explained the prosecutor general, 
"was 
the continuation of some witness examinations and a report by a 
witness on cases he was familiar with for the purpose of 
comparing his statements with those of the defendants." 
<H5>  What Happens Next </H5>
  The house arrest requested by the drug traffickers was also 
ruled out in the discussions. "What must be verified now is how 
much they are willing to cooperate and what mechanisms can be 
implemented to make sure they do not continue to commit crimes 
through third parties," stated the prosecutor general, "but the 
government must also make sure that the work being done on the 
Cali and Palmira prisons will guarantee that they cannot escape." 
  History will be the judge as to whether this "surrender" 
will 
result in impunity. 
<H5>  [Box, p 13A] </H5>
<H5>  Government Explains Surrender </H5>
  The national government broke its silence on the various 
interpretations of the application of Article 369E of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure (CPP), which establishes measures to allow 
persons implicated in crimes to cooperate fully with the 
authorities. It stated its legal position on the matter in a 
letter to Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff. 
  Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez Diaz explained the purpose 
of the regulations and warned that some trial attorneys are 
trying to manipulate the system to obtain decisions that will 
make it easier for their clients to escape prosecution. 
  The minister took this stand after the alleged members of 
the 
Cali Cartel, Helmer Herrera Buitrago, Jose Olmedo Ocampo, and 
Juan Carlos Ramirez, appeared before the Prosecutor General's 
Office to request that an investigation be opened pursuant to 
the aforementioned CPP article. 
  Gonzalez Diaz stated that the mere fact that a person 
appears 
before the appropriate authority on the pretext that he is being 
sought by law enforcement is not legal grounds to issue an order 
to open a preliminary investigation or hold a probable cause 
hearing, and went on to say that this would put the 
responsibility for initiating criminal action exclusively in the 
hands of those who are trying to inveigle the authorities into 
filing criminal charges against them.

that U.S. diplomatic officials visited his office and that he 
had answered U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno. 
  [Begin recording] [De Greiff] No, no, it was not a matter of

  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prosecutor, one last question. 
It would seem that your WASHINGTON POST article has caused 
quite a frenzy in the United States. 
  [De Greiff] That is correct. I am very sorry that this has

  [Text] The government has decided to make public its 
position on the appearance of Valle drug kingpins before justice 
authorities. By failing to confess their crimes, the kingpins 
are hoping that the government will open investigations against 
them, whereupon the lack of evidence will virtually preclude any 
further action against them. 
  According to Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez, the 
government 
has expressed its concern and alerted Prosecutor General Gustavo 
de Greiff so that "the nation can head off the legal maneuvering 
of criminals who are trying to evade responsibility" and set up 
"an eventual impunity" for themselves. 
  The minister, in a seven-page letter, said that in a shrewd 
interpretation of the regulations on surrendering to the 
authorities, the drug traffickers' attorneys think their clients 
can go to justice officials without confessing to any crimes or 
cooperating in any meaningful way, so that cases will be opened 
and then they will be let go for lack of evidence. 
  "These individuals, assuming that no formal evidence will be 
provided in an investigation against them, are counting on a 
preliminary inquiry or formal prosecution to begin under the 
aforementioned regulations and then to result in no 
determination of criminal liability because of their failure to 
cooperate. 
  "In the first case, if a preliminary investigation takes 
place, they are hoping that after the four-month term is up, as 
provided in the code, the Prosecutor General's Office would be 
forced to issue an order of dismissal, which would not make the 
case res judicata, but would be a convenient 
mechanism for making it appear that the individual is not a 
suspect in any crime. 
  "In the second case, that is, if they try to get a criminal 
investigation opened, their objective is none other than to have 
an inquiry begin that would then find no evidence against them, 
whereupon they could request (...) that the Prosecutor General's 
Office issue a ruling in the preliminary hearing that would 
preclude a probable cause proceeding. That order would indeed 
make the case res judicata, which could eventually 
lead to impunity for them." 
  With reference to the letter, De Greiff told EL TIEMPO 
yesterday that "the Prosecutor General's Office, as a division 
of the judicial branch, will not issue general directives; it 
will issue only the writs and other orders that are within its 
purview, in each particular case. Therefore, it will take no 
position on the minister's letter." 
  The minister's letter comes in the wake of the appearance of 
three alleged drug kingpins of the Valle region, Elmer Herrera 
Buitrago ("Pacho Herrera"), Luis Carlos Ramirez Abadia, and Jose 
Olmedo Ocampo, at the Prosecutor General's Office between 11 and 
14 January of this year. 
  Herrera, Ramirez, and Ocampo and their attorneys stated that 
they were appearing before justice officials pursuant to Article 
369E of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that 
anyone who has good cause to believe he is being sought by the 
authorities may appear before justice officials to clarify his 
legal status. 
  After the appearances, the Prosecutor General's Office 
ordered the corresponding preliminary inquiries to begin, 
because, as De Greiff explained, no charges had been filed or 
evidence gathered that would make it possible to arrest them. 
  The appearance of the three alleged drug traffickers 
precipitated meetings this week between De Greiff and Attorney 
General of the Nation Carlos Gustavo Arrieta and President Cesar 
Gaviria. The latter expressed concern that he had not been 
informed of the matter and called for closer cooperation. 
  The government believes that Article 369E applies to cases 
of 
individuals who "are known to be or firmly believe themselves to 
be sought or pursued by the authorities." 
  In other words, people who are currently being investigated 
or who, knowing that no such investigation is taking place, turn 
themselves in precisely to confess their crimes. 
  According to Gonzalez's letter, in the government's view, 
"if 
a person merely appears before the authorities without providing 
any evidence of a punishable act or possible criminal liability, 
there are no grounds to open an investigation, because that 
would mean putting the responsibility for initiating criminal 
action in the hands of potential defendants," with the risk of 
the maneuvers mentioned above. 
  Launching investigations prematurely without solid evidence 
or without a confession or acknowledgement of guilt by the 
individual could result in impunity, according to the government. 
<H5>  Confession </H5>
  The executive branch's position on this matter is that, when 
individuals who are not the subject of criminal investigations 
come forward, Article 369B of the new code applies, "which is 
why the article is entitled `Benefits for Persons Not Being 
Prosecuted.'" 
  Specifically, the article states: "If the person giving 
testimony freely and spontaneously confesses his participation 
in punishable acts, pursuant to Article 33 of the Political 
Constitution, and cooperates to ensure that justice is done, an 
investigation shall be opened in his case." 
  This is the scope of the new regulations for the surrender 
policy, says the minister. In essence, these regulations require 
effective cooperation with law enforcement so that a preliminary 
investigation or formal probable cause proceeding may take 
place, resulting in sufficient evidence to prosecute the person 
appearing to provide such evidence. 
  "We cannot forget the basic objective of the justice system, 
which is to bring criminals to justice, either by pursuing them 
until they are arrested and convicted, or by applying the 
surrender policy on the basis of cooperation for effective 
administration of justice." 
  Finally, in his letter to De Greiff, the minister urges that 
a consensus be reached so that "we can continue the surrender 
program on the proper terms" and so that the government can 
decide what guarantees it will offer, including incarceration 
facilities and other security measures. 
  "Because this issue is so important for the country, the 
government believes it is essential to maintain close and 
constant cooperation and coordination with the Prosecutor 
General's Office and the Attorney General's Office in this 
regard. In that way, the concerns that have been expressed can 
be taken into consideration and a consensus can be reached on 
such vital issues, and this will benefit the surrender policy," 
emphasizes the letter. 
<H5>  [Box, p 22A] </H5>
<H5>  Highlights of the Letter </H5>

  -  The mere fact that a person appears before the appropriate 
authority on the pretext that he is being sought by law 
enforcement is not, in our opinion, legal grounds for issuing an 
order to open a preliminary investigation or probable cause 
proceeding; if that were to occur, the decision to pursue 
criminal action would be placed exclusively in the hands of 
those who are deceitfully trying to get a criminal prosecution 
going against themselves (...). 
  Anyone who appears without intending to cooperate is only 
trying to inveigle the authorities into issuing a decision that 
will serve as an obstacle later on, to prevent unfavorable 
rulings when the state manages to obtain sufficient evidence of 
his guilt. 

  -  A person appearing for the sole purpose of having an 
investigation opened so that the state will try to prove that he 
committed a punishable act runs counter to the purpose of the 
regulation, which is to ensure the effectiveness of justice; 
unless the person simply confesses his crime, in which case 
Article 369B of the Code of Criminal Procedure should be 
applied. 
  -  The application of Article 369E of the procedural 
statute is predicated upon cooperation with justice authorities. 
Indeed, the aforementioned regulation is part of the legal 
institution known as "surrender to and cooperation with justice 
authorities," which is aimed at imposing the proper penalties on 
those who have violated other people's rights but who have 
agreed to abide by the social and legal order. That is also the 
reason why the appearance is made exclusively before the 
prosecutor general of the nation or his deputy. 
  -  The provisions 
that set forth rewards for cooperating with justice authorities 
distinguish between two situations: that of persons who are 
being prosecuted and that of persons who are not. 
  As for the first case, it necessarily implies that the 
authorities have evidence of the person's guilt, so coming 
forward and cooperating effectively are among the many criteria 
taken into consideration in the discretionary decision to grant 
the benefits provided by law (literal E), Article 369A. 
  Now, if the person is not being criminally prosecuted, 
Article 369B of the Code of Criminal Procedure should be 
applied. It was specifically designed to address such cases, 
which is why it is entitled "Benefits for Persons not Being 
Prosecuted." Its second paragraph states: "If the person giving 
testimony freely and spontaneously confesses his participation 
in punishable acts, pursuant to Article 33 of the Political 
Constitution, and cooperates to ensure that justice is done, an 
investigation shall be opened in his case...." It should be 
noted that in this case, appearing before the authorities is not 
one of the criteria for deciding whether to grant benefits, and, 
therefore, it was expressly excluded as a reason for granting 
benefits during the debate and passage of the law in the 
Congress of the Republic. 

  -  From the above, it is concluded that as we interpret 
Article 369E of the procedural statute, the following 
prerequisites would have to be met for its application: 
  a. That there be effective cooperation in the administration 
of justice, in accordance with the criteria that govern such 
matters. 
  b. That there be a preliminary investigation or formal 
probable cause proceeding. 
  c. That such proceedings result in sufficient evidence to 
prosecute anyone who is thought to be involved in criminal 
activity or who has come forward to provide such evidence.

  [Text] Papal Nuncio Monsignor Paolo Romeo said that the 
prosecutor general has no authority to interfere in church 
matters or to investigate any of its bishops. Prosecutor 
General Gustavo de Greiff said the investigations will continue. 
  [Begin recording] [de Greiff] We are studying that. Msgr. 
Paolo Romeo argues his point, and the Attorney General's Office 
says the Concordat is not in effect. We must study these things 
in detail and make a decision at the proper time. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Will the investigations against the 
bishops continue? 
  [De Greiff] Yes. [end recording] 
  Regarding the drug legalization issue, the prosecutor 
general 
said: 
  [Begin de Greiff recording] That is not the government's 
position. It is my position in light of the failure of the 
methods being used to fight drug trafficking by which the 
producing and trading counties carry all the weight, while 
consumer nations do very little. I think this is the only 
solution, but it is something that must be studied. [end 
recording] 
  Regarding possible U.S. reactions to his position, de Greiff 
said: 
  [Begin de Greiff recording] I do not think they would be as 
imperialistic as to do that. Nevertheless, if they did it, we 
would judge them. [end recording]

  [Text] The nation's general prosecutor [Gustavo De Grieff] 
sent the Foreign Ministry hard evidence confirming a guerrilla 
summit was held in Havana at the beginning of 1994. Foreign 
Minister Noemi Sanin will ask the Cuban Government for an 
explanation. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified Reporter] Madam Minister: A 
few days ago, you ruled out this possibility; you said you 
trusted the Cuban Government. What made you change your mind? 
Why are you asking for an explanation? 
  [Sanin] Things happen between states the same as between 
individuals, and while one does not have evidence, 
demonstrations, or proof, the principle of good faith is 
maintained. Otherwise, we would be engaged in completely 
aggressive international relations. That day, I said that if the 
Colombian Government obtained proof or evidence of Cuban or any 
other nation's interference in its internal affairs, we would 
act accordingly. Yesterday, the prosecutor general visited me 
and he gave me the evidence. There are serious signs of a 
guerrilla presence at a meeting held in Cuba. We still cannot 
label it treason or subversive; this still has to be 
investigated. Therefore, in keeping with the offer and our 
obligations, we are asking the Cuban Government for an 
explanation. Once we have their reply we will proceed. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Ayala; from the "24 Hours Newscast"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Similar to his revelations on the excesses 
committed at the La Catedral Jail, Prosecutor General Gustavo de 
Greiff once again hit the nail on the head. This time he 
supplied evidence to the government that Colombian guerrillas 
and a bishop attended a secret summit in Cuba in January, which 
EL TIEMPO newspaper has been reporting. The prosecutor general 
today reported that part of the Guerrilla Coordinating Board 
leadership met in Havana, Cuba, with a Colombian bishop. 
  Although he did not give any names to avoid violating legal 
proceedings, it was learned that over the past few hours the 
prosecutor visited President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo and Foreign 
Minister Noemi Sanin. He delivered a document and informed them 
about the status of the investigations into a trip to Cuba by 
guerrilla leaders Alfonso Cano [Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia, FARC, general staff], Ivan Marquez [FARC], Alberto 
Gutierrez Bermudez, and Lionel Pardo. 
  [Begin recording] [De Greiff] We have evidence that shows 
that guerrilla leaders or subversives, whatever you want to call 
them, went to Cuba. 
  [Ayala] Was Monsignor Nel Beltran also there? 
  [De Greiff] A bishop was there; I cannot say who. [end 
recording] 
  The Colombian Episcopal Conference insists that Bishop Nel 
Beltran was not the one in Cuba. However, intelligence 
organizations report that the priest traveled to San Jose, Costa 
Rica, to attend a religious summit, rested 15 days in the United 
States afterwards, and on his way back returned via Cancun, 
Mexico, from where he traveled to Havana to attend the meeting 
which EL TIEMPO newspaper has reported. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Teresa Ronderos, political editor of EL </F>
TIEMPO] 
  [Text] Before venturing into the fascinating results of 
this poll, in which a representative sample of Colombians not 
only say for whom they are going to vote, but also describe the 
candidates and say what they want changed in the next 
government, our readers need a word of warning. 
  This poll was done BEFORE Andres Pastrana entered the 
campaign and announced his platform. We wanted to take the pulse 
of public opinion just before his campaign began, and then 
measure it again in a few weeks so we can evaluate the impact of 
the official start of his campaign. 
  Also, while the poll was being conducted (which took a week 
because it used personal interviews) and the results analyzed, 
Colombian politics was suddenly jolted. Alvaro Gomez announced 
that he was putting aside his antipathy toward the Pastrana 
family and joining the Pastranist bandwagon; Carlos Lleras de la 
Fuente, a former member of the Constituent Congress, entered the 
campaign as a candidate for the Liberal Party primary; and 
another hopeful, Gloria Gaitan, made use of the door Lleras had 
opened to join in the liberal contest. 
  In order to reflect part of these sudden changes, EL TIEMPO 
asked the CNC [National Survey Center] to conduct a telephone 
poll in Colombia's five largest cities to investigate the 
liberal primary results with the two new candidates included. If 
the liberal primary to select a single presidential candidate 
were held today, the results would be: Ernesto Samper, 54 
percent; Humberto de la Calle, 14 percent; Carlos Lleras de la 
Fuente, 12 percent; Carlos Lemos Simmonds, 8 percent; David 
Turbay, 3 percent; and Rodolfo Gonzalez and Gloria Gaitan, each 
with 1 percent. 
  Lleras de la Fuente's impact is considerable, especially in 
Bogota, where he would get his highest percentage: 18 percent. 
In Barranquilla, though, he would only get 4 percent. Judging by 
former polls, Lleras would take some votes from Lemos, something 
from Samper, and a little from De la Calle. But he also attracts 
new votes from people who said they would vote for none of the 
candidates or did not know for whom they would vote. 
<H5>  The First Round </H5>
  Like the poll results broadcast in recent days by the major 
radio stations, this poll shows that the presidential race is no 
longer tied between Samper and Pastrana. Samper gets 39 percent 
of the votes, and Pastrana, 32 percent. This seven-point 
difference is significant, as the margin of error is 3.1 percent. 
  In third place is Antonio Navarro, the Democratic/Alliance 
M-19 candidate with 11 percent, followed by Miguel Maza Marquez 
with 4 percent. Regina Betancourt is next with 3 percent; then 
Enrique Parejo, 2 percent; Gabriel Melo, 1 percent; and Rodrigo 
Marin and Juan Diego Jaramillo, less than 1 percent each. 
  Samper is strongest in midsized cities, where he gets 46 
percent. Pastrana's support, though, is spread proportionally 
among small, midsized, and large cities. Navarro gets most of 
his support in small cities, where he wins 15 percent. Maza is 
stronger in large and midsized cities; Parejo, in large cities. 
The fact that the poll included Barranquilla and Santa Marta 
among large and midsized cities explains why the latter two 
candidates, both from the coast, did well there. 
  As in former polls, this shows that Samper has a 
considerable 
edge among men and people over 40. If only women and young 
people voted, Pastrana would catch up to Samper. Navarro also 
does better with the 18 to 24 age group.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The most striking fact is the great difference among social 
classes. Pastrana leads Samper by 25 percent in the upper 
classes; Samper leads by 9 points among the middle classes, and 
the two candidates are virtually tied among voters from the 
lowest classes. 
  Looking at the results by party, both Pastrana and Samper 
pick up votes from members of the opposing parties. Nine percent 
of the conservatives say they will vote for Samper, and 12 
percent of the liberals say they will vote for Pastrana. Still, 
Pastrana does better than all his rivals with people who say 
they have no party affilation; 35 percent say they will vote for 
Pastrana. 
<H5>  Why Did Samper Go Up? </H5>
  "Please think about what you know, have heard, and have seen 
that Andres Pastrana has done in the last three months, and tell 
me if at this time you feel more inclined, less inclined, or 
equally inclined to vote for him than you were three months 
ago," the people surveyed were asked. The same question was 
asked about Ernesto Samper. The answers show the shift. 
  Twenty-seven percent said they were more inclined to vote 
for 
Andres and 30 percent less inclined, giving him a 3 percent 
negative balance. Perhaps that is the cost of starting his 
campaign late. Samper, though, has 35 percent more inclined and 
21 percent less inclined, a positive balance of 14 points. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|During the last three months, have you changed your mind about voting for: | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Candidate         |More inclined (pe-|Less inclined (pe-|No change (percen-| 
|                  |rcent)            |rcent)            |t)                | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Samper            |35                |21                |29                | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Pastrana          |27                |30                |27                | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Some political analysts say Samper's considerable gain is 
due 
to the intense work done by the Liberal Party machinery since 
the beginning of the year, aiming at the parliamentary 
elections. There are 134 candidates for the Senate and 302 
candidates for the Chamber: 436 liberal candidates mobilizing 
thousands of people in support of their party. That has to help 
the candidate with the best chance of winning the Liberal Party 
primary. 
  The Samper campaign takes the view that Samper's central 
message, the fight against unemployment, has now taken hold of 
people, and more people now think this candidate is the one who 
would best deal with unemployment. 
  In this poll, the problem most citizens cited as the leading 
problem is unemployment (56 percent), followed by lack of safety 
for the population, with 14 percent (most frequently mentioned 
in large cities and by people from the lowest social classes), 
and guerrilla violence (11 percent).

  According to Pastrana's campaign managers, things will 
change 
after the congressional elections, as the liberal machinery's 
activity will decline. There is also a broad group of undecided 
voters, among whom, according to their research, Pastrana has 
more support. They say that after a few weeks of campaigning, 
many of these undecided voters will decide to support the New 
Democratic Force candidate. 
  Perhaps also for the reasons stated above, Samper appears to 
have a 9 percent edge over Pastrana in a possible second round. 
<H5>  What Do They Want Changed? </H5>
  In general, when asked if they prefer change or continuity 
in 
government policies, people generally say they want change. And, 
according to this poll, a considerable majority would like a 
change in direction in some specific policies: social policy, 
dealings with the guerrillas, and privatization of state 
enterprises. In the first case, 60 percent of the Colombian 
people would like the next president to change social policy, 
while 28 percent would like the same policy to continue. 
Sixty-three percent want a change in the method of dealing with 
the guerrillas, and 29 percent would like the present course to 
continue. A similar pattern is seen with the privatization of 
state enterprises (see table).

  Change in handling the guerrillas is desired most in large 
cities. Where the most people would like a change in social 
policy is in large and small cities. 
  On the economy, the majority, 59 percent, would like new 
strategies, but 35 percent want continuity. International 
relations and the handling of the drug traffic is where most 
people would like the next government to maintain the current 
president's policy. 
<H5>  Characteristics </H5>
  Even though the trend shows Samper ahead of Pastrana, when 
people describe the candidates' characteristics, they see in 
each of them particular strengths and weaknesses (see table).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Samper's best recognized characteristic, compared with 
Pastrana, is experience. On this point the liberal has a 
17-point advantage over his rival. 
  The quality most people attribute to Pastrana is leadership. 
Where he is closest to his rival is his understanding of 
ordinary people's problems; on this point, they are practically 
tied, taking the margin of error into account. 
  When people are asked what they want of their president, the 
first thing they mention is honesty (32 percent); then an 
ability to solve people's problems (25 percent); experience (19 
percent); and intelligence (12 percent). Strangely, leadership 
is not one of the top-priority qualities.

<H5>  Technical Polling Date </H5>
  This poll was conducted for EL TIEMPO by the CNC among 1,100 
people who said they are going to vote in the upcoming 
presidential elections. 
  A random sample of households was chosen in four large 
cities: Bogota, Cali, Medellin, and Barranquilla; six midsized 
cities: Santa Marta, Ibague, Pereira, Cucuta, Pasto, and 
Villavicencio; and 12 small cities: Yarumal, Sogamoso, 
Zipaquira, Lorica, Fundacion, La Dorada, Buenaventura, San Jose 
de Isnos, Santander de Quilichao, Floridablanca, Cordoba 
(Bolivar), and Calarca. 
  The interviews were conducted in person between 6 and 10 
February. An EL TIEMPO reporter accompanied a CNC interviewer 
for one day in Bogota and interviewed some of the persons polled 
in greater depth. 
  This poll's maximum margin of error is 3.1 percent. This 
means that if a candidate gets 30 percent in the poll, in 
reality his vote may be between 27 and 33 percent. 
  Because of the last-minute changes in Liberal Party primary 
candidates, EL TIEMPO asked the CNC to do a new poll to measure 
voting intentions with the new range of candidates. 
  This poll was done on 16 and 17 February by telephone. Six 
hundred people chosen at random were called in Bogota, Medellin, 
Cali, Barranquilla, and Bucaramanga. In this survey, the margin 
of error is 4.1 percent.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Mar (NA) -- OAS Secretary General 
Joao Baena Soares said that the most disquieting issue for the 
OAS is "persistent extreme poverty" and that Cuba's readmission 
to the OAS "must be considered." 
  Baena said: "Issues such as the gap between those having too 
much and those having nothing and the lack of equal 
opportunities must be addressed to consolidate democracy." 
  He said: "I have noticed that there is growing awareness of 
this problem among governments, which appear to have the 
political will to address it in an orderly fashion." 
  Commenting on Cuba's readmission to the OAS, Baena said the 
issue "is generally discussed in the hallways" of the OAS. 
  Baena noted that there are two positions on the subject: On 
the one hand, there are those contending that "the time has come 
to review the situation," while on the other there are 
governments, such as that of the United States, that "contend 
that first there must be internal changes in Cuba before 
reconsidering its readmission." 
  Baena said he is in favor of revising the Inter-American 
Reciprocal Assistance Treaty (TIAR), which was unsuccessfully 
invoked by Argentina to obtain U.S. help during the Malvinas War. 
  Baena, who is a Brazilian diplomat, added: "Just as the OAS 
amended its charter three times during the past 10 years, it is 
necessary to revise the TIAR, which was signed under very 
different circumstances than those prevailing today. We must 
give new answers for new circumstances."

  [Text] Brasilia, 20 Mar (EFE) -- The foreign ministers and 
government delegates of the 13 Rio Group countries on 21 March 
will open in Brasilia a 48-hour meeting that will serve to sound 
out their preferences in the election of the next OAS secretary 
general. 
  The meeting will be held on the eve of the 27 March vote in 
Washington, at which the continent's 35 foreign ministers will 
choose the replacement for Brazilian diplomat Joao Baena Soares 
as OAS secretary general. 
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli -- who is 
one of the three candidates for the post -- will attend the 
three work sessions of the ministerial meeting, which will be 
held on 21 and 22 March at Itamaraty, the Brazilian Foreign 
Ministry headquarters. 
  The other candidates are Colombian President Cesar Gaviria 
and Costa Rican Foreign Minister Berns Niehaus. 
  Even though it is not on the meeting's agenda, the OAS 
secretary general's election will be discussed in the corridors 
and even during formal sessions, which are flexible and during 
which any delegate can raise an issue, diplomatic sources told 
EFE. 
  Brazil, the country that hosts the meeting in its capacity 
as 
holder of the annually rotating secretariat of the most 
important Latin American political forum, supports Gaviria and 
is confident he will win, a high-ranking Itamaraty official told 
EFE. 
  Gaviria should win, despite the fact that "the situation has 
not yet reached a definitive status," he said. 
  The majority of Rio Group countries that referred to the 
matter -- Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Brazil, Peru, and Mexico 
-- support Gaviria. 
  The Costa Rican candidate has assured that he has the 
support 
of the Caribbean and Central American bloc, while the Venezuelan 
candidate has called on his two opponents to hold a television 
debate to be aired to the entire continent for the purpose of 
outlining their positions toward the OAS. 
  The winner of the 27 March vote will be installed during the 
OAS general assembly to be held from 5-10 June in the Amazon 
city of Belem do Para (northern Brazil), the hometown of Baena 
Soares, a former Brazilian deputy foreign minister who has held 
the OAS secretariat for two consecutive five-year periods since 
1984. 
  The Rio Group ministers and government delegates will 
address 
various international issues dealing with commerce, disarmament, 
UN bylaws' reform, the environment, the antinarcotics fight, 
democracy, human rights, and initiatives to end the military 
regime in Haiti. 
  They also will exchange views and seek a consensus on the 
position of Latin American governments on a continental summit 
called by U.S. President Bill Clinton for December in Miami. 
  The ministerial meeting will coincide with the official 
visit 
of 5.5 hours that U.S. Vice President Alberto Gore will pay to 
Brasilia on 21 March with the objective of promoting the 
continental summit with Brazilian President Itamar Franco. 
  Gore today began in La Paz a short tour of Latin America 
that 
will include stopovers in Buenos Aires and Brasilia. 
  Meanwhile, Trinidad and Tobago Foreign Minister Ralph Maraja 
and Jorge Gordillo, one of Peru's deputy foreign ministers, 
already have arrived in Brasilia to attend the Rio Group meeting. 
  Foreign Ministers Celso Amorim (Brazil), Antonio Aranibar 
(Bolivia), Miguel Angel Burelli (Venezuela), Luis Ramirez 
Boettner (Paraguay), Manuel Tello (Mexico), Gladys de Vielman 
(Guatemala), Carlos Figueroa (Chile), and Sergio Abreu (Uruguay) 
have confirmed that they will attend. 
  Other delegations scheduled to arrive today or on 21 March 
will be headed by Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando 
Petrella and Colombian Deputy Foreign Minister Andelfo Garcia, 
while Ecuador will be represented by its ambassador in Brasilia, 
Cesar Valdivieso.

  [Text] The United Workers Trade Union Federation (CUT) has 
come out against the candidacy of Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria to become the OAS secretary general. The CUT also asked 
the government not to vote for Gaviria because this organization 
believes human and union rights were systematically violated 
during the Gaviria administration. 
  The CUT and the international organization to which it is 
affiliated, the ICFTUO [International Conference of Free Trade 
Union Organizations], said that during President Gaviria's 
four-year administration the cases of human rights violations, 
far from decreasing, increased. The CUT sent a letter to Foreign 
Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner stating its disagreement 
with Gaviria's candidacy. 
  The letter says: "We have proof that the personal position 
of President Gaviria and his government has been of indolent 
indifference to these events. The Colombian union movement is 
among those that have paid with their lives for their action in 
defense of workers. Colombian and international human rights 
organizations have pointed out that in a significant and 
alarming number of cases the alleged people responsible for the 
violations were members of the Armed Forces and state security 
organizations." 
  The letter adds that the seriousness of Colombia's situation 
has led the ICFTUO Human and Union Rights World Committee to 
dedicate to that country its first campaign, which is now being 
prepared. The CUT letter adds: "Therefore, we would like to 
request that Paraguay not vote for that candidate. The OAS is a 
valuable organization that cannot stain its prestige. It must be 
led by an individual who has not been questioned on an important 
issue such as human and union rights." 
  The letter sent to the foreign minister is part of a 
continental campaign by the international union movement. The 
letter concludes by saying: "It is an effort to prevent an 
individual under whose administration human rights were violated 
many times from being elected."

  [Text] President Carlos Menem on 18 March said: "If we 
want to move forward in the area of security and confidence in 
order to consolidate peace, it is essential to attack the 
scourge of poverty." He also emphasized his concern "about the 
misery that is the result of the lack of jobs." He made these 
remarks in a speech he delivered at the closing session of a 
meeting of OAS specialists who addressed measures of confidence 
and security. 
  Menem also praised Brazilian Joao Banea Soares, the outgoing 
OAS secretary general, who in his speech emphasized the devotion 
to peace of the region's countries, highlighting the example of 
Argentina, Chile, and Brazil, which signed agreements 
establishing nuclear controls and banning chemical weapons. 
  In referring to Baena Soares' speech, Menem said: "Those 
agreements should serve as guidance for future steps we can take 
regarding our relations." 
  The president previously emphasized that in regional 
integration efforts, diplomacy plays a major role, adding that 
there is "cooperative diplomacy," along with "preventive" 
diplomacy "to prevent confrontations that can be irreversible 
and irreparable." 
  Menem also admitted that in the continent "there are some 
minor conflicts, but which are conflicts nonetheless," noting 
that "we should tackle them in order to solve them." As an 
example to be followed, he mentioned the recommendations of the 
OAS meeting's final document, which covers matters referring to 
cultural, educational, and military affairs. 
<H5>  Recommendations </H5>
  The conclusions of the specialists' deliberations were 
considered "modest" but predictable within the path toward 
designing a new security system for the region, sources 
consulted by CLARIN said. 
  The six-point document states in point three that it is 
necessary "to recommend that member countries regularly 
communicate to the appropriate OAS offices about the 
implementation of measures to promote confidence." 
  Specialists have said that this point, especially the 
periodical nature of such communications, is the beginning of a 
system of consultations. This is one of the most significant 
matters approved on 18 March. 
  Likewise, the OAS Special Hemispheric Security Commission 
(presided over by Argentine Ambassador Hernan Patino Mayer) was 
urged to continue with the examination of measures for 
strengthening confidence, "and among others, the measure 
regarding the peaceful settlement of controversies and the 
prevention of conflicts." 
  This is different from an Argentine proposal to create a 
permanent center for the prevention of conflicts. It was not 
possible to establish a mechanism for regular defense ministers 
meetings either. However, a new meeting was set for 1995 in 
Chile.

  [Text] Joao Baena Soares, the Brazilian secretary general 
of the OAS, said on 17 March that the possibility of an armed 
forces' participation in the antinarcotics effort "had not been 
requested by the United States through the OAS, and the idea had 
only been placed under discussion." 
  Baena Soares added that the possibility of including drug 
trafficking on the agenda of the meeting he will hold with 
President Carlos Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella on 18 
March "depends on the decision" of Argentine officials. 
  As to armed forces' participation in the antinarcotics 
effort, he said: "It is up to each country to decide about that 
because several countries believe this is a task to be fulfilled 
by police." 
  The OAS has a special commission to deal with this issue, 
and 
Baena Soares said he is in favor of "concentrating efforts to 
reduce demand for drugs." 
  He said: "To reduce this demand means to educate and 
rehabilitate drug addicts and reinstate them into society." 
  At 1030 today, Baena Soares and Menem will attend the 
ceremony closing the OAS experts' meeting that has been 
discussing the guidelines of a new security system for the 
hemisphere that can adapt to the changes that have been 
occurring in the international political scene. 
  On 17 March, Menem received from the Panamerican Foundation 
for Development the Inter-American Leadership Award for 1994. 
President Menem was decorated in the presence of Baena Soares. 
Thanking him for the honor, Menem said he was proud to have 
"brought peace" to the country by granting presidential pardons. 
  At the end of the 17 March meeting, four basic points to be 
included in the final document were established. This final 
document will officially be released at the end of the experts' 
meeting that started 15 March. 
  According to a proposal made by a U.S. delegation member, 
the 
OAS might establish "a center for the solution of conflicts" 
occurring in countries on the American continent, and a 
mechanism to bring together OAS member countries' defense 
ministers similar to the one that institutionalized the foreign 
ministers' conferences. It was established during the meeting 
that the Inter-American Defense Committee should advise the OAS 
political organizations, and that the Inter-American Defense 
College should cooperate in reorganizing a security system for 
the continent.

<F P=106> [Special report by Katia Brasil from Manaus, Brazil] </F>
  [Text] The Manaus Federal Superintendency will implement 
Operation Blockade [Operacao Bloqueio] using an intelligence 
network [rede de informacoes] that involves the Armed Forces of 
Brazil and of its neighboring countries, federal agencies, fuel 
distribution companies, and some 200 federal policemen. The 
objective is to join forces against drug trafficking along the 
Amazon border region and get Brazil off the UN list of countries 
used as transit routes by drug cocaine. 
  Brazilian Federal Police Superintendent Mauro Sposito has 
said the strategy of Operation Blockade was discussed with 
Venezuelan, Peruvian, Colombian, and Bolivian military leaders 
during the Sixth Military Exchange meeting last week. So far 
only Brazil and Venezuela have formally agreed to participate. 
These two countries are at the start of the cocaine route that 
begins in Colombia and ends in the United State and Europe. The 
Colombian Army could lend its support to this project. Sposito 
said this will be essential if the operation is to be successful. 
  Operation Blockade will be conducted on four fronts. First, 
Tabatinga and Manaus river police patrols will intercept the 
cocaine that is shipped by the Amazon River. Second, 
enforcement actions in Colombia will be monitored. Third, 
flights of aircraft will be placed under surveillance: With the 
help of the Air Force, the Brazilian Petroleum Corporation, 
ESSO, and Shell, the Federal Police will control the air space 
thus repressing traffickers who move cocaine by air. 
  The fourth front has been in action since November: Radio 
frequencies used by drug traffickers are being monitored from 
Tabatinga and Tefe. This led to the arrest of two drug bosses 
in Belem.

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 17 Mar (EFE) -- Argentine Senator Luis 
Rubeo, secretary of the Latin American Parliament [Parlatino] 
committees, on 17 March dismissed rumors spread from Venezuela 
that the Venezuelan Congress might not join Parlatino, which 
groups 22 countries in the region. 
  Asked about the absence of Venezuelan deputies during the 
committee meetings being held at the Parlatino's permanent seat 
in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Sen. Rubeo said: "This is a natural 
consequence of political readjustments that occur after new 
officials are elected." 
  The Venezuelan congressmen who are members of the Parlatino 
committees could not travel to Sao Paulo because President 
Rafael Caldera's Convergence Party, which recently became the 
ruling party, demanded a revision of all international 
activities by the Venezuelan Congress. As a result, the 
deputies' trip was not authorized. 
  Rubeo said: "We support the winds of austerity blowing in 
the 
brotherly country, but we are sure that Venezuela will not give 
up the privileged positions it has won in the international 
community thanks to its fervent effort to support continental 
integration." 
  "Through me, Parlatino urges the Venezuelan congressmen to 
continue participating in this task aimed at drafting programs 
that will end hunger and inequalities in the continent," Sen. 
Rubeo said. 
  Venezuelan Deputy Henry Bencid, Parlatino vice president for 
Venezuela, said in Caracas on 16 March that his country risks 
staying out of Parlatino because "Convergence opposes Congress 
complying with its international commitments." 
  According to Bencid, who is a leader of the opposition 
Social-Christian Party [COPEI], Convergence's attitude results 
from a "misunderstood" position of austerity, which has been 
announced by the new administration. 
  The Venezuelan deputy asserted that a revision of the 
Venezuelan Congress' international activities, as demanded by 
President Caldera, might imply derogation of the law that 
approved Parlatino's institutionalization. 
  Bencid said that if this occurred, the Venezuelan Congress 
would have to quit Parlatino and lose the benefits granted by it. 
  Currently, several Venezuelan congressmen occupy important 
positions in Parlatino. The president, for example, is Social 
Democratic Action Party Deputy Humberto Celli, and the vice 
presidents of three committees are Venezuelan deputies.

  [Text] Sao Paulo, Brazil (EFE) -- Upon installing three new 
Parlatino [Latin American Parliament] committees today, Senator 
Luis Rubeo stated that Latin American countries must learn to 
negotiate and to impose their competitive advantages. 
  Only in learning how to negotiate at the regional level, the 
Argentine senator said, will Latin American nations have the 
opportunity to "impose their rights and defend their 
production," including in a general manner the possibility of 
joining a free trade agreement, which should include not only 
North America, but all the Americas. 
  "It is necessary for Latin America to elevate the sights of 
its negotiating capability when it is a question of imposing its 
rights and defending its regional production, where financial 
flows have the advantage over the flow of trade products," Rubeo 
added. 
  "It is necessary," he added, "for Latin America to impose 
its 
competitive advantages in continuing the fight for our rights to 
trade regional production, without obstacles, in order to 
correct the region's trade imbalance, which continues to be 
financed with foreign debts." 
  "The eventual joining of a more ample integration process 
that would link the entire American continent in the immediate 
future, for example the economic area that has been created by 
NAFTA, requires a capability for negotiations that can only be 
acquired at a regional level," he said. 
  Rubeo termed encouraging the advances in the negotiations to 
bring in line the Andean Group, the Group of Three, the Latin 
American Economic System, and the Common Market of the South 
(Mercosur). 
  The Argentine senator presented his discourse to some 30 
congressmen from the 24 countries making up Parlatino, who began 
their meeting today to begin the work of the three new 
committees. The meeting, which is being held at the 
organization's permanent seat in Sao Paulo, will conclude 18 
March. 
  With the installation today of the Subregional, State, 
Municipal, and Provincial Affairs Committee; the Economic 
Affairs, Finance, and Foreign Debt Affairs Committee; and the 
Social Debt Committee, Parlatino now has 16 functioning 
committees. 
  According to Rubeo there are now only two of the 18 
committees left to be installed, while the Narcotics Committee 
has progressed most in its tasks. 
  This committee has already prepared an extradition and 
repression treaty against illegal chemicals (precursors for the 
manufacture of drugs), which must be studied and voted on by the 
congresses of all Latin American nations so that it can be 
implemented. 
  In his address Rubeo referred to the adverse social economic 
conditions that are being experienced by Latin America, which 
are a threat to democracy. 
  The Argentine senator stated that the institutionalization 
of 
regional integration into trade blocs "expands the support bases 
of our democracies, and creates power resources for each 
subregion and for Latin America as a whole."

  [Text] Guatemala City, 17 March (ACAN-EFE) -- The 
Nicaraguan Government today appointed its ambassador to 
Guatemala, Mauricio Diaz Davila, as permanent observer to the 
Central American Parliament (Parlacen). 
  Salvadoran citizen Jose Francisco Guerrero, president of the 
Parlacen, explained that the diplomat's appointment is temporary 
until Nicaragua, which has already ratified the charter for this 
regional forum, elects its 20 representatives. 
  He added that Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal 
notified him in writing of Diaz' appointment as permanent 
observer, given "the importance of Parlacen meetings." 
  The Parlacen was created three years ago as a regional forum 
to discuss the area's political, economic, and social issues. 
So far only Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras have appointed 
representatives, while Costa Rica and Panama have yet to ratify 
the charter.

  [Text] The meeting that had been scheduled for 20 March in 
Formosa, Argentina, among Paraguayan President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy, Argentine President Carlos Menem, and Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has been postponed. The 
decision was prompted by the fact that Sanchez de Lozada could 
not attend the meeting, because he is scheduled to meet in La 
Paz with U.S. Vice President Al Gore on that day. 
  The three presidents had been scheduled to meet on 20 March 
to discuss the Pilcomayo River issue. Yet the above problem has 
forced a postponement of the "minisummit" to a later date. 
  During Sanchez de Lozada's recent visit to Asuncion, 
Bolivian 
Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga noted that the Formosa 
presidential summit might be postponed. It was confirmed 
yesterday at Lopez Palace that the meeting has in fact been 
postponed.

  [Text] San Salvador, 20 Mar (ACAN) -- Leaders of the former 
Salvadoran guerrillas have launched strong criticisms against 
the organization of the general elections which took place on 20 
March in El Salvador. They have said the elections "are 
unacceptable" and that they would be contested in other 
countries. 
  Former guerrilla Commander Joaquin Villalobos, leader of the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), has accused 
the conservative and ruling ARENA [Nationalist Republican 
Alliance] party of plotting to reduce the number of voters. He 
added "many people were unable to vote."

  [Text] ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance], the ruling 
party, was unable to maintain the absolute majority it obtained 
when the official vote tally for Sunday's elections started; and 
the results indicate a runoff election will be needed. ARENA, 
with a conservative ideology, continues to drop little by little 
from the 51.22 percent it initially had when 50.31 percent of 
the votes were counted and as the vote tally continues. The 
Salvadoran electoral law stipulates a runoff election must be 
held between the two leading candidates if none of the seven 
candidates who participated in the elections obtain more than 50 
percent of the votes. 
  Former San Salvador Mayor Armando Calderon Sol, 45, expected 
to win the first round while his main opponent, leftist 
coalition candidate Ruben Zamora, will regroup for the runoff 
election and try to win it with the support of other opposition 
groups. Zamora, a combative 52-year-old politician who has lived 
in exile, has 27.85 percent of the votes in the presidential 
elections, and it is likely his vote percentage will also drop. 
  His closest rival, Christian Democrat Fidel Chavez Mena, has 
13.98 percent; and votes for the candidates of four minority 
parties totals less than nine percent. There was 46.9 percent 
abstentionism and this figure is considered high given the 
expectations raised by the first elections to be held in El 
Salvador following the 1992 Peace Accords. The leftist coalition 
attributed the low voter turnout to critical mistakes in the 
voter registration list, which prevented thousands of citizens 
from exercising their right to vote. Specifically speaking, the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, FMLN, a former 
guerrilla organization that disarmed and became a political 
party a year ago, blamed ARENA for the irregularities and 
accused it of fraud. 
  Referring to the elections for Legislative Assembly deputies 
and municipal officials, the percentages are similarly 
distributed to the presidential election votes, with an 
overwhelming advantage for ARENA. In the deputy elections, the 
Conservative Party obtained 45.35 percent; the left, 31.15 
percent; and the Christian Democracy, 14.51 percent; while 
municipal power is distributed in this manner: 44.65 percent for 
the conservatives; 26.61 percent for the coalition; and 17.39 
for the third group. 
  These results do not offer ARENA much of a difference 
compared with the previous presidential elections held in 1989, 
in which Alfredo Cristiani -- who will relinquish the presidency 
on 1 June -- won the post in the first round with 53.8 percent 
of the votes. 
  Calderon Sol avoided claiming a victory in his first 
statements after the official tally began, waiting until the 
results are confirmed, but he criticized the Zamora's 
predictions concerning the certainty of a second round of 
elections. "It is clear the people still prefer us," Calderon 
Sol said and then he thanked the Cristiani Government, also of 
ARENA, for its successful administration of the country. 
  Sunday's elections, watched by a contingent of 3,000 UN and 
foreign government and organizations observers, were the first 
electoral test for the FMLN, which obtained better results than 
those predicted by polls. 
  Calderon Sol advocated a program that continued Cristiani's 
liberal economic experience, while the FMLN and the two social 
democratic parties that support Zamora want to implement a much 
more social policy, aimed at solving the people's critical needs. 
  Aside from the criticism about irregularities voiced by the 
left, the tranquillity which prevailed in Sunday's elections was 
praised by most of the political groups and the UN Observers for 
El Salvador (Onusal). Onusal issued a communique highlighting 
the absence of critical incidents and the peace and freedom with 
which 2.5 million Salvadorans summoned to the elections cast 
their ballots.

  [Text] Today, Sergio Cerbello, Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front [FMLN] representative to Europe, accused the 
Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA] of buying votes in the 
20 March elections in El Salvador. Cerbello, who gave an 
interview following a telephone conversation with Ruben Zamora, 
candidate for the leftist coalition which also includes the 
FMLN, expressed his confidence that a second round will be 
necessary to elect a president because none of the candidates 
have won an absolute majority. 
  Sergio Cerbello, who is in Madrid at the invitation of the 
Spanish United Left coalition (led by the Spanish Communist 
Party), expressed surprise for victory statements made by ARENA, 
the official party, since the Supreme Electoral Tribunal has not 
released definitive results yet. 
  In light of the high abstentionism rate registered during 
the 
elections -- approximately 47 percent -- Cerbello said "it was 
the same as other elections held in the past ten years." 
Therefore, both the left and the right should concede that "they 
have not been able to motivate the people to vote." 
  Regarding leftist candidate Ruben Zamora's chances vis-a-vis 
ARENA candidate Armando Calderon in a possible runoff for the 
presidency, Cerbello said that "it all depends on the Christian 
Democracy Party [PDC]. The PDC representative in Europe has 
guaranteed me that the PDC will support Ruben Zamora, but they 
cannot guarantee people will comply with the party's 
instructions." 
  Cerbello announced that if the need for a second round is 
confirmed, Julio Anguita, leader of the Spanish United Left 
coalition, will travel to El Salvador to support Ruben Zamora in 
his race for the presidency.

  [Text] The Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] is unhappy. It 
says we cannot report the data coming from the Voting Table 
Boards; that is what the TSE is saying and is threatening to 
take action against the radio station. I would like to tell the 
TSE gentlemen that the political parties not the news media have 
accepted that law, a law that gags the freedom of thought to 
broadcast facts, which have already turned into news after the 
voting ended. So as not to cause problems to this company, I am 
henceforth going to be silent on the survey and the results 
coming from the Voting Table Boards from all over the country. 
I only have one thing to say to the TSE gentlemen, who are 
supposedly living in a democratic country: Not even the 
country's most sinister criminal dictatorships kept the news 
media from reporting the results that came from the Voting Table 
Boards. That is what you, TSE gentlemen, have done. I am 
publicly asking you, for tomorrow and the next elections, to 
correct the tremendous disarray you generated, as thousands of 
Salvadorans did not appear on the voting lists. Before gagging 
the news media, correct the disarray inside the TSE for the sake 
of all Salvadorans. Colleagues from this station all over the 
country, we will keep our information to ourselves. One has to 
express regret that politicians of the TSE and the parties have 
accepted a law that is not for the news media. The news media 
and the people's will must not be gagged. That is the sad thing. 
  TSE gentlemen, allow me to repeat this: Not even the 
country's most sinister and criminal tyrannies succeeded in 
subduing the news media, as you have tried to do today. Long 
live freedom of expression, something for which we will fight 
tirelessly from this trench. I regret the conduct and 
pseudolegal position of the TSE gentlemen.

  [Text] San Salvador, 20 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, Ruben 
Zamora, Salvadoran presidential candidate for the leftist 
coalition that includes former guerrillas, reported the presence 
of soldiers at several voting centers in the interior of the 
country even though this presence is prohibited by the electoral 
laws. At a news conference, Zamora said: "We are concerned that 
we have detected a military presence in urban centers in seven 
towns in the departments of La Union, Chalatenango, Ahuachapan, 
Cabanas, San Vicente, Cojutepeque (Cuscatlan), and San Martin 
(Cuscatlan)." 
  At least 2.5 million Salvadorans will elect a new president, 
vice president, 84 Legislative Assembly deputies, 262 municipal 
mayors, and 20 representatives to the Central American 
Parliament (Parlacen) in the first elections since the civil war 
(1980-92). 
  According to the peace agreements signed by the government 
and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, FMLN, in 
January 1992, the new National Civilian Police (PNC) should be 
solely in charge of public security, but since the PNC has only 
been deployed in seven of the country's 14 departments, the old 
National Police also participates in those tasks. A total of 
8,000 members from these two organizations are in charge of 
security for the elections. 
  Zamora also reported other "irregularities" in the voting, 
like propaganda "abuse" by the ruling Nationalist Republican 
Alliance (rightist ARENA). He said, "The law absolutely 
prohibits this." He also reported an excessive number of cars 
with ARENA banners and symbols and a delay in opening voting 
centers, which has "hindered" the people's right to vote. 
  Zamora also asked the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) to 
provide voters with more transportation because, according to 
him, this is another problem in the electoral process. Despite 
these charges, Zamora said he can give "a positive assessment of 
the process," and he added that no major incidents have occurred 
in the centers where the 6,981 voting tables are installed.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Antonio Alvarado from La Paz Department; </F>
from the "YSKL 94 Electoral News Coverage" program] 
  [Text] Despite the apparent normalcy in the electoral 
developments in this department's municipalities, Jose Gilberto 
Alegria, Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN] deputy 
candidate, has reported certain irregularities in this election. 
  [Begin Alegria recording] All municipalities have reported 
three irregularities. First, ARENA [Nationalist Republican 
Alliance] representatives have been spreading propaganda and 
handing out fliers at all polling stations. During the predawn 
hours, ARENA supporters painted slogans and posted posters. 
  Second, in all of the municipalities there were delays in 
setting up Voting Table Boards. There is a report from 
Chinamequita, for instance, where by (?0820) the Voting Table 
Board had not been installed. Also, at the same time, ARENA 
held a meeting in the mayor's office with all its supporters 
where the packages that had to be delivered to the Voting Table 
Board were held, but these packages had not been delivered. 
  Third, there have also been constant problems in three 
[number as heard] municipalities: La Herradura, San Juan Talpa, 
San Pedro Masahuat, and San Pedro Nonualco, where ARENA 
representatives have bought votes. There have been reports of 
people voting up to three times. There are also irregularities 
in such municipalities as San Juan Nonualco and San Rafael 
Obrajuelo concerning the order of ballot numbering; in addition, 
concerning San Juan Nonualco and San Rafael Obrajuelo, 
especially San Juan de Nonualco, there have been ballots for 
deputies on which the FMLN flag does not appear. [end recording] 
  Gilberto Alegria, who is running for deputy on the FMLN 
ticket in La Paz Department, has called on the people to come 
out and vote.

  [Text] San Salvador, 20 Mar (ACAN) -- The Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal (TSE) denied today there are soldiers outside their 
barracks in reply to left-wing claims about a military presence 
at certain polling stations. 
  TSE Magistrate Eduardo Colindres told ACAN-EFE at the voting 
sites [colegios electorales] "the police are tasked with looking 
after the people's safety, and I can assure you the Army is not 
there." 
  Shortly after the general elections started today in El 
Salvador, Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate for the leftist 
coalition, which comprises former guerrillas and the Social 
Democracy, claimed soldiers were present in seven countryside 
towns, although this is banned by the Electoral Law. 
  Francisco Flores, deputy candidate for the ruling 
Nationalist 
Republican Alliance (right-wing ARENA), also told ACAN-EFE there 
is no military presence in the countryside but added certain 
policemen are clad in olive-green uniforms, and this makes them 
resemble soldiers. Flores said "this does not imply an Army 
presence." 
  At least 2.5 million Salvadorans will elect today, in the 
first elections since the civil war ended, a new president and 
vice president, 84 deputies to the Legislative Assembly, 262 
municipal mayors, and 20 representatives to the Central American 
Parliament (Parlacen). 
  The TSE, government, political parties, and UN observers 
have 
reported the elections have progressed normally so far, without 
any serious incidents.

  [Text] Certain Voting Table Boards are expelling poll 
watchers [vigilantes] from the premises, an act that goes 
against the law. The poll watchers have been appointed 
specifically to observe the vote count and even vouch for its 
authenticity with their signature, if required. 
  I repeat: Poll watchers cannot be removed from voting sites. 
This is a tremendous mistake that may result in any party that 
may suffer from this filing an appeal for annulment. This is 
taking place in the Republica de Brasil School and the Manuel 
Jose Arce Institute. They have even gone as far as to try to 
expel the press from those premises.

<F P=106> [Message to the nation by Salvadoran President Alfredo </F>
Cristiani; date and place not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] Salvadoran brethren: Next Sunday, 20 March, is a 
very special date on the historic calendar of our fatherland. 
Since 28 March 1982, we Salvadorans have been making great and 
permanent efforts to establish and develop democracy in our 
country. We have been successful in our endeavor. We have been 
able to gradually legitimize the electoral system, which has 
resulted in governments originating directly from the will of 
the people. Within that framework of legitimacy, it was 
possible to promote the process that led to the attainment of 
peace in our country. 
  Without democracy, peace would have been impossible. 
Democracy is the work of the people who made great sacrifices 
for the sake of democracy. Peace, therefore, is also the work 
of the people who have accepted it as something that belongs to 
them. We must defend and strengthen it in a process that will 
lead us to definitive political and economic stability with 
opportunities of liberty and progress for all. 
  Within that process, Sunday, 20 March is a day of great 
responsibilities and possibilities. The elections for president 
and vice president of the Republic, for deputies to the 
Legislative Assembly, and for municipal councils throughout the 
country will take place on the same day as the result of a very 
fortunate concurrence of the electoral calendar as established 
by the Constitution. It is a day when all elected offices will 
be renewed. To this we add the significant fact that these 
elections are the first to be held free of the dark scenario of 
the war behind us. 
  The electoral system has been improved by the constitutional 
reforms, which fully guarantee that the elections will be honest 
and functional, with the vote of each citizen in every part of 
the country being valuable and secured and contributing to the 
general will, which is what will decide who should lead the fate 
of the country from the various posts in the years to come. 
  Thus, this is a great opportunity to continue consolidating 
our democracy, and that is why it is such an important 
responsibility to go to the polls to vote. That vote is the 
only legitimate weapon of citizens who want to build a 
fatherland with freedom, security, and stability. 
  This Sunday, young people, adults, and the elderly -- women 
and men -- must go to the polls. With our votes we will decide 
on the leadership of the next government. We will do it with 
our votes, not with weapons. We will do it with the force of 
reason, not with unreasonable force. Nobody should exclude 
himself from this great task. Abstention is self-exclusion, and 
nobody wins by it, much less the nation. 
  Dear fellow countrymen; everything is prepared so Sunday's 
elections will be exemplary. The electoral and security 
mechanisms are ready to guarantee the honesty and tranquillity 
of the elections. In addition, the eyes of the world are on 
these elections, which are taking place within the framework of 
pacification that has merited the respect and admiration of the 
international community. 
  In this context, we want to commend the work of the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal, which has efficiently fulfilled its role. 
The legitimacy of the process and the free expression of 
Salvadorans is guaranteed. 
  Fellow countrymen; all that remains to be done is for you to 
go to your polling station next Sunday and freely cast your vote 
according to your conscience and inclination. Go with your 
family members, with your children, because an election such as 
the one to be held on 20 March should be a lesson in civics with 
mutual respect and joy. Among us we are building the fate of 
our beloved El Salvador. Do it while thinking of your future 
and the future of our dear fatherland. 
  Go and vote, as everyone who wants a better country will do. 
We want a humane, harmonious, and peaceful country. Let us all 
remember that we are all brothers at the polls for the sake of 
El Salvador. May God enlighten your decision on 20 March.

<F P=106> [News conference by Salvadoran Supreme Electoral Tribunal, </F>
TSE, magistrates, headed by TSE President Luis Arturo Zaldivar, 
with unidentified reporters at the Presidente Hotel in San 
Salvador -- live] 
  [Text] [Zaldivar] [Words indistinct] this call from the 
Salvadoran Supreme Electoral Tribunal to inform you of a 
resolution we issued today at 1300, which we believe is very 
important for the electoral process that will culminate on 20 
March. The resolution reads as follows: 
  After studying the case of Arcatao, San Jose de las Flores, 
San Isidro Labrador, and Nueva Trinidad Municipalities, all in 
Chalatenango Department, and for what the TSE believes are 
extenuating circumstances in those places, we resolve: 
  That the 20 March elections in those municipalities be held 
simultaneously in the departmental capital of Chalatenango as 
well as in the respective municipalities. 
  The TSE will be in charge of transporting the members of the 
Voting Table Boards and the party poll representatives with the 
support of Salvadoran Air Force helicopters. 
  Once the voting is over in those municipalities, the ballot 
boxes and other electoral documents, as well as the members of 
the Voting Table Boards and party poll representatives, will be 
transferred by the same means to the departmental capital. Once 
there, they will proceed, according to the law, to open the 
ballot boxes, count votes, and issue the closing and vote count 
certificate, which should include the election results in the 
respective municipalities and in the departmental capital and 
which should be signed by all members of the Voting Table Boards. 
  The security and the personal and moral safety of the 
members 
of the Voting Table Boards, party poll representatives, and Air 
Force crew members who will transport the personnel and 
electoral documents, as well as the safety of the helicopters, 
will be the responsibility of the mission of UN Observers for El 
Salvador, Onusal. 
For notification: 
  This is the TSE resolution issued this afternoon in an 
effort 
to find a satisfactory solution according to Salvadoran law. We 
are sure we have found a solution within the legal framework by 
establishing voting procedures that take the requirements and 
conditions in those places into consideration but which also 
respect our laws. That is the announcement we wanted to make. 
We urge you to inform the Salvadoran and international public. 
  [Reporter] It was said that conditions were not right for 
holding elections in those municipalities. What has changed? 
  [Zaldivar] The solution says that extenuating circumstances 
persist. It is clear in the resolution. 
  [Reporter] What factors made you change your mind? 
  [Zaldivar] We have not changed anything. We have maintained 
the participation of voters residing in the departmental capital 
and the integration of the Voting Table Boards in the 
departmental capital for each of those municipalities. This has 
not changed. We are also giving facilities to those sectors who 
protested saying that they live in those places. Well, those 
who live in Arcatao will vote there; and voters from Arcatao who 
live in the departmental capital of Chalatenango will vote in 
Chalatenango. 
  As I said, the resolution is intended to provide facilities 
so all voters legally registered in the Electoral Registry and 
who have a voter registration card can vote wherever they are. 
  [Reporter] What extenuating circumstances [words indistinct] 
for the next government? 
  [Zaldivar] No. I can mention two extenuating circumstances 
-- as stated in the TSE's initial resolution -- for the transfer 
of the members of the Voting Table Board from the municipalities 
to the departmental capital. The Municipal Councils of those 
four municipalities are not handling their official business in 
their respective municipalities but in the departmental capital. 
They have not been able to return. It has not been possible to 
install the municipal electoral boards in those municipalities 
and their activities are being handled in the departmental 
capital. We have received notes from those municipal electoral 
boards saying that they are in exile. 
  [Reporter] What kind of controls will there be to prevent 
people from voting twice, as some will be voting in the 
departmental capital and others in the municipalities? [Words 
indistinct] to control that possibility? 
  [Zaldivar] There will be controls throughout the country. 
Our voting system uses indelible ink, which ensures that each 
person can vote only once, not only in this case but throughout 
the country. Immediately after a person votes, his finger will 
be stained with indelible ink. Should he try to vote at another 
voting table, the first thing he will be asked to do is to show 
his hands to make sure that his finger is not stained with 
indelible ink. 
  [Reporter] In general terms, how are preparations for 
tomorrow proceeding at the national level? Some irregularities 
have been reported with the electoral register [words 
indistinct] total number of voters? 
  [Zaldivar] Magistrate Colindres will answer that question. 
  [Colindres] As far as I know, complaints have been received 
from San Antonio de los Ranchos and Las Vueltas involving the 
electoral list. What happened? Certain citizens -- to be more 
precise, a little over 16,000 citizens -- requested voter 
registration cards and said they wanted to vote in a given 
municipality. After they received their voter registration 
card, they decided they wanted to vote in another municipality. 
When the TSE realized that these people had received their 
voter registration cards and then asked to vote elsewhere, it 
excluded them from the list of the place where they had received 
their voter registration card and then issued them another voter 
registration card so they could vote in the other municipality. 
Otherwise, these persons would end up with a voter registration 
card for the first place and one for the new place. 
Consequently, to guarantee....[pauses] As soon as a new voter 
registration card is issued, the previous one is eliminated. 
That is what happened with the 16,000 citizens who decided to 
change their polling place. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Zaldivar, refugee liaison boards claim you 
have blocked the work for which they were elected because you do 
not want to accredit them to supervise the implementation of 
[words indistinct] the country's elections? 
  [Zaldivar] The Pollwatchers Board members were sworn in on 
26 May 1993 and have been accredited and working within the TSE 
since then. The Pollwatchers Board is made up of a 
representative and an alternate for each of the legally 
registered political parties. I do not know what they mean when 
they say they have not been accredited. 
  [Reporter] Commander Gerson Martinez said you did not want 
to accredit the alternate members so they could work. 
  [Zaldivar] They were accredited. I do not know what kind of 
accreditation they have in mind. They are working....[pauses] I 
personally swore in Gerson Martinez -- all of them -- on 26 May, 
so I do not know what accreditation they have in mind. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Zaldivar, there were some complaints from 
Jutiapa, Cabanas Department. Apparently some of the ballots did 
not include the MNR [National Revolutionary Movement] flag. Do 
you know about that? 
  [Zaldivar] No, we know nothing about it. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Zaldivar [words indistinct] at the last 
minute concerning different polling places in the country. 
People in [name indistinct] municipality complain that the 
logistics failed there because they have yet to receive what the 
TSE promised them. 
  [Zaldivar] What municipal voting board? 
  [Reporter] There are reports from the representatives of 
the... 
  [Zaldivar, interrupting] No, I mean what department. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Zaldivar] What was their complaint, please? 
  [Reporter] They complain about logistics problems. They 
have yet to receive the material they were promised and they 
lack the human resources to handle tomorrow's elections. 
  [Zaldivar] No, quite the contrary. The president and two 
members of the electoral board in San Salvador visited us at 
noon today. They came to report something we had learned of 
only minutes earlier, through the electoral project's management 
office. They said the Francisco Menendez National Institute had 
not been opened, and the electoral material could not be brought 
in. I immediately contacted the appropriate official, meaning 
the education minister, and the pertinent orders were given. We 
were surprised to learn that a polling place....[pauses] an 
education center that was publicly mentioned in this week's 
newspapers as one of the Education Ministry facilities requested 
by the TSE was not open. 
  The Education Ministry publicly listed the education centers 
that would be used as polling places, and the Francisco Menendez 
National Institute was among them. Consequently, the minister 
issued the necessary orders and the facilities were opened 
minutes later. All the material has been delivered and is ready 
for tomorrow at 0600, when the Pollwatchers Board will be 
installed so voting can begin at 0700. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Zaldivar, what will happen in the case of 
Jutiapa Municipality, for example, where apparently the MNR flag 
does not appear on the ballots for municipal councilmen? Will 
Article 325 of the electoral code be implemented to suspend the 
voting process? That is, if this is true, since the reports we 
have are unofficial. 
  [Zaldivar] First of all, I cannot answer because we have no 
official or unofficial report on the incident. We knew nothing 
about this situation until now. Any case that may arise will be 
analyzed based on the legal provisions, and it will also be 
settled based on the same legal provisions. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Zaldivar, this morning Dr. Zamora reported a 
series of irregularities concerning the electoral material 
[words indistinct] will be used tomorrow. He also spoke about 
transportation for the voters. Have you solved the 
irregularities [words indistinct] meeting this morning? 
  [Zaldivar] Yes. The truth is that we did not discuss any 
irregularities. The most important topic of discussion was the 
Chalatenango municipalities. We could hardly refer to events 
that have not happened yet. For us, facts are only what is 
officially known and confirmed. 
  [Reporter] Do you think the measures taken in Chalatenango 
contribute to reconciliation or polarization? Also, is there a 
formal agreement among all the parties? Did your people consult 
all of the parties, including the FMLN, for this effort? 
  [Zaldivar] The code very specifically states that the 
determination of extenuating circumstances and their subsequent 
resolution are the exclusive responsibility of the TSE. 
Nevertheless, this tribunal has consulted the political parties 
when it has made decisions about the elections. One example is 
electoral procedure. Although the code empowers us to establish 
procedures for these elections, we have consulted the political 
parties. They have even signed records of these consultations 
expressing their acceptance of the election procedure. The same 
is true of other activities, which, although our authority is 
exclusive, we shared with the political parties. 
  [Reporter] I also asked you if you think these measures 
contribute to reconciliation or polarization in these 
municipalities. 
  [Zaldivar] We are convinced that this contributes to 
reconciliation because we are allowing voters to cast their 
votes in their areas of residence. In addition, voters who have 
reason not to return to their municipalities can cast their 
votes where they feel safer. I think both groups will feel 
safer. 
  [Reporter] How many voter registration cards must still be 
distributed? 
  [Zaldivar] I would like to clarify that there is nothing 
left 
to distribute because the deadline expired at 0000 on 17 March. 
We distributed 825,000 voter registration cards, which exceeds 
our goals. 
  [Reporter] How soon does the TSE expect to have the 
(?election figures?) 
  [Zaldivar] Well, as soon as possible. This is not a definite 
time, of course, but we expect to have results by 2200. We do 
not expect to announce final results by that time. We hope to 
be able to announce any wide margins in the vote count. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Zaldivar] There are 2,722,000 registered voters. I have 
said 
that 825,000 voter registration cards have been issued as part 
of the registration drive. 
  [Reporter] How many cards have been issued in the country? 
  [Zaldivar] A total of 2,600,000 persons have their cards. 
The 
figure I gave previously is the number of cards issued in the 
past few months. This figure, plus the cards that had already 
been issued, means that 2.6 million Salvadorans will cast their 
votes. 
  [Reporter] The opposition parties tried to introduce a 
proposal whereby 60,000 youths who turn 20 would be permitted to 
vote. What happened to that legislation? 
  [Zaldivar] You said it. They tried to introduce a proposal. 
The current law does not permit that. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Zaldivar] Let us not confuse things. The code does not say 
the blind cannot vote. 
  [Reporter] How could they? 
  [Zaldivar] We do not have a special procedure in the code or 
in Salvadoran electoral law to make it possible for the blind to 
vote. Guatemala has incorporated the Braille system onto the 
ballot so the blind can vote. In El Salvador, however, the 
blind are very smart. It is not necessary to mark a flag. You 
can even fold the blank ballot and put it into the ballot box. 
If he can make a mark, he can also do this. Their teachers 
could have instructed them on the approximate location of the 
blind person's party flag. In addition, they can be aided by a 
seeing person both in arriving at the Voting Table Board and 
also going into the voting booth, where he can make his mark by 
himself. Then his seeing companion will accompany him to the 
ballot box where he will cast his vote. It is perfectly 
possible for a blind person to vote. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, what is the total number of voting 
tables for tomorrow's elections? 
  [Zaldivar] There are 6,981 tables. 
  [Reporter] What did you talk about with [words indistinct]? 
Did it have anything to do with the municipalities? 
  [Zaldivar] No. They came to request information. The 
secretary was preparing the final draft of the resolution as 
they arrived, so there is no relationship.

  [Text] The Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) reported that 
in the event there is no absolute winner in the 20 March 
presidential elections, a second electoral round is scheduled 
for 24 April. TSE President Dr. Arturo Zaldivar said the TSE has 
everything ready for a second round. 
  Political party representatives who were asked, however, 
listed the inconveniences a second round would cause. Therefore, 
they have asked citizens to make every effort to vote on Sunday 
to decide once and for all their future. A second round would 
cause generalized uncertainty, directly affecting investments. 
Likewise, new elections would freeze bureaucratic work. Just 
organizing a second round would cost millions [currency not 
specified]. The parties would have to spend money on new 
propaganda. Citizens would be again exposed to partisan 
propaganda. Voters would have to face further discomfort. 
  Zaldivar, on the other hand, rejected a possible FMLN 
[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] election challenge 
in Chalatenango Department. The FMLN are dissatisfied about 
concentrating four municipality voting sites in the department's 
capital. Zaldivar said it is not true that the UN is pressuring 
them to leave the polling stations in Arcatao, San Jose las 
Flores, Nueva Trinidad, and San Isidro Labrador. "We do not 
accept domestic or foreign pressures," the official stated. 
  He said the FMLN has no possibility of challenging the 
elections there because the TSE is in compliance with the law. 
On this Zaldivar said: "Challenges are made when the law is 
disregarded. We are obeying the law." He added that the general 
rule is that voting should occur in the municipalities but the 
same law covers exceptions. It states that voting places may be 
changed due to unforeseen circumstances or in rare cases. Other 
voting places have also been changed, like San Francisco Gotera, 
which was moved to Cara Sucia, and Colon, which will be moved to 
Lourdes. "In these cases, nothing was said because there is 
simply no political interest," Zaldivar said.

<F P=106> [Report by Wilmer Lizama; from the "YSKL 94 Electoral News </F>
Coverage" program] 
  [Excerpt] The elections have been held under good 
conditions here in San Miguel. We visited the towns of 
Chinameca, Moncagua, and Quelepa and talked with residents who 
said at least 1,600 people are registered to vote in the town of 
Chinameca. 
  There are approximately 11,000 registered voters in Moncagua 
Municipality. In Moncagua, Jose Felicito Rivas Gomez, mayoral 
candidate for the Nationalist Republican Alliance, ARENA, said 
the residents of this area have turned out to vote in large 
numbers. These are the areas in which during the wartime 
residents did not come out to vote. 
  Meanwhile, Vice President Francisco Merino Lopez is here in 
San Miguel. He gave statements to YSKL listeners on the 
elections, which have been called the elections of the century. 
  [Begin Merino recording] Thank you, YSKL friends. We are 
really surprised at this civic festivity Salvadorans and San 
Miguel residents are witnessing. We believe, from our 
comparative analyses, there are many more voters in these 
elections than in previous ones, a reflection of the people's 
expectations there would be more freedom of expression with 
peace. 
  We believe the elections are being held orderly and 
normally. 
A great deal of political definition is perceived in the 
atmosphere, in terms of which parties are more organized and 
have more supporters. The way people are dressed helps one 
understand for whom they would vote. I think we are taking a 
very important step in the country's political history. We will 
gain a privileged position on the continental level with these 
elections. 
  In addition to general currents, all currents of political 
thinking are participating in the elections, and the people will 
decide with their votes, freely, who will be elected. [end 
recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [News conference by Vice President Jose Francisco Merino </F>
with unidentified reporters on 20 March; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Merino] We have really had a demonstration of great 
civic spirit. I think today could serve to prove Salvadorans 
want to live in peace and democracy. We have surpassed our 
expectations. Voter turnout was high. Although the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal [TSE] will give the figures, the turnout was 
high, with a few exceptions. 
  The people's participation was truly unexpected, and the 
results have been categorical. Without daring to give figures, 
I would like to say the people voted intelligently. They know 
and see the link that existed between the situation and violence 
we had before and how peace was achieved and how we are 
gradually achieving social and economic recovery. 
  There has to be justice for all, because we undoubtedly have 
to realize our priority is to work for the neediest. With their 
vote, they are now saying this is the right course. They have 
entrusted the majority of the municipalities and the assembly 
seats, the Presidency and the vice presidency to an 
administration such as the one we have had during these five 
years. There are no loses here; that is very important for you 
to note. The only winner is the Salvadoran people. Just as we 
gained with peace, we are gaining with democracy. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Merino] ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] is 
receiving 
a mandate from the people, freely expressed at the polls. The 
people who will enforce it have great talent and experience. 
Their honesty has already been proved, meaning that vote was 
not wasted but will serve to improve our country. 
  [Reporter] Can you affirm you have won? 
  [Merino] (?I know), but the TSE will give the figures. It is 
now clear the people voted for ARENA, for El Salvador. Let me 
say [words indistinct] from the east, I was in the east, San 
Miguel in particular. I visited several centers there. The 
behavior is the same. The proportions are holding up. For 
their own interest, there are some who would like to wait until 
the decimal figures are out. The signals are clear, however, 
[words indistinct] The TSE has to announce the figures. The 
interest of many people who were kind to visit us.... [pauses] 
And it is good foreign observers came, because that also helps 
the country's economy. ARENA got twice the votes the FMLN 
[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] did. These things 
are important. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] the complaints have not been 
long in coming. The FMLN has already complained regarding 
certain irregularities that prevented a large turnout. 
  [Merino] I just told some reporters from another news medium 
the FMLN leadership must review or rethink its remarks. If 
there was one thing we had too much of today in all polls, it 
was FMLN people with their vests and pins. They were there 
watching at the voting tables. A Democratic Convergence member 
belongs to the TSE. To say there was fraud amounts to not 
trusting their own people who worked the whole day and their 
voters who spent the whole day at the voting places.

  [Text] Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, chief of the UN Observers 
for El Salvador [Onusal], has affirmed Sunday's general 
elections are being held normally. He only noted some minor 
logistics problems. What I have said confirms these elections 
have been rightfully termed the elections of the century and 
will play a key role in consolidating peace, Ramirez Ocampo has 
said during an interview. 
  Upon noting the civility and democratic culture the 
Salvadoran people have demonstrated in these general elections, 
Ramirez Ocampo has said the peace agreements are yielding their 
fruits, adding the elections are being held with a large voter 
turnout and amid peace. 
  In addition, President Alfredo Cristiani has said everything 
is reported normal in several schools where polling sites are 
located in the capital, while international observers are 
confirming the Salvadoran people's demonstration of patriotism. 
  President Alfredo Cristiani has said the elections, the 
first 
elections held after the signing of peace with guerrillas in 
1992, have become a true civic party. 
  The left has reported the presence of soldiers in polling 
stations in the interior and problems regarding the opening of 
electoral sites, but, as the right has done, it has highlighted 
the positive balance of the elections.

[One-second break in reception] for YSKL listeners, what is 
your opinion on the elections? 
  [Santamaria] For me, this is a real demonstration of 
civility 
of a people who would like to demonstrate this is their 
opportunity to have an election in peace. We must take 
advantage of this situation to define the country's future and 
choose the person to whom we will entrust that responsibility. 
We view this as a demonstration of civility but also of a great 
democratic conviction of the Salvadoran people [three-second

process concludes satisfactorily; this will allow the Salvadoran 
people to accept the results and support whomever wins this

  [Iraheta] How have you seen the development of the process 
today? 
  [Santamaria] We have witnessed the elections in the polling 
stations we have visited. We perceive everything is normal, as 
the very Supreme Electoral Tribunal has confirmed. It was 
expected, however, some irregularities could occur; these have 
been at a minimum, mainly administrative irregularities, but 
they have not [two-second break in reception] the process.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Colonel Juan Antonio </F>
Martinez by an unidentified reporter from the Presidente Hotel 
in San Salvador--live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] We want to hear Interior Minister Colonel 
Juan Antonio Martinez Varela's opinion on the elections, because 
he was a member of the commission that reached the peace 
agreement in Chapultepec. Colonel, pleased to have you with us. 
  [Martinez] Thank you very much. I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to salute the Salvadoran people on such an important 
occasion. This was a historic day when the ideas, concerns, 
values, and all things that interest the Salvadoran people were 
at stake. 
  I think this enormous number of observers who came here will 
attest to what happened here, that this was for real. The 
results will reflect much of the Salvadoran people's political 
and mental development. We hope the people will grow fully 
aware that what transpired here represents a great step forward 
for the Salvadoran people. 
  [Reporter] Is this electoral process, which concluded on 21 
March with nationwide general elections, a way to consolidate 
the effort you, as a negotiating commissioner, as a commissioner 
for dialogue, made to reach the agreements in Chapultepec two 
years ago? 
  [Martinez] Undoubtedly, I think so. A phase was virtually 
closed, and, I think, another phase has begun. The elections 
reflect the preferences of the Salvadoran people, and this is 
why we are anxious to learn about the official results. Various 
quarters have reported the initial unofficial results. We 
reached this phase and another phase, which will strengthen the 
country's democratic development, has started. [sentence as

<F P=106> ["Initial Report" by Supreme Electoral Tribunal, TSE, read </F>
by unidentified TSE official--broadcast in progress] 
  [Text] ...participating in the elections we have 
witnessed. No one can deny the atmosphere of calm surrounding 
the elections. We must cite the absolute freedom, without 
coercion or pressure of any sort, the voters enjoyed as they 
exercised their sacred right and duty of voting. 
  We must also admit there are certain aspects that are 
outside 
human control; in this regard, we must admit at certain polling 
stations the opening of the elections was delayed for a few 
minutes due to difficulties stemming from the election of 
station presidents and secretaries at 0600, as required by law. 
Such stations are comprised of representatives of all political 
parties participating in the elections. 
  Moreover, we must admit some citizens who had voter 
registration cards did not appear on the voter registration 
list. This will be noted, and, as the TSE, we will adopt 
corrective measures. 
  After the last municipal council election in [word 
indistinct] in 1991 a company specializing in polls conducted 
one indicating 10 percent of 1 percent--that is, a tenth of 1 
percent--of the voters claimed to have been left off the voter 
registration list; thus, we will be able to determine this 
figure after the elections. We will be able to quantify this. 
  We want to underscore a very important aspect regarding 
compliance with Electoral Code provisions. I will read Article 
230, Paragraph Two. It reads: Fifteen days prior to the 
elections and until the results of it are definitely declared, 
no political parties or coalitions, individuals or corporations, 
associations or organizations of any nature may publish or 
disseminate, via any medium, results of polls or projections on 
candidates, political parties, or contending coalitions that 
might indicate the trend of possible electoral results. Failure 
to abide by this will be punished in keeping with Article 290 of 
the Electoral Code, which states: Violation of the provisions 
of Article 230 of this code will result in the levying of fines 
between 10,000 and 50,000 colones on the violators. 
  This is the legal situation. The TSE will enforce these 
provisions, and thus, we warn all media to abstain from making 
these kinds of publications banned by the code; in fact, this is 
not only banned by the code. The candidates and political party 
representatives have signed a document before the president of 
the Republic, UN Observers for El Salvador, and the TSE. Part 
of it states the following: We will abstain from reporting on 
the results of the elections until the TSE issues the 
corresponding reports. 
  Now that this has been clarified, we warn the media may not 
report anything banned by law; thus, the Salvadoran people are 
duly informed of the aspects we have cited. We also want to 
note that, according to the same pact the political parties have 
signed, the closing of the elections will occur after every 
voter waiting to cast his vote has done so. This is of what 
this tribunal wished to inform you to avoid regrettable 
incidents later.

  [Text] The government platform of the PDC [Christian 
Democratic Party] calls for the creation of an equitable, 
binding, and modern economy by broadening the business base, a 
frontal attack on extreme poverty, and the creation of new 
economic and social agents. PDC priorities are to invest in 
people and focus national efforts on the universalization of 
services, like education, health, nutrition, environmental 
protection, and potable water. It will seek to increase fiscal 
reform to ensure that the state has the necessary resources to 
invest in these areas. 
  Secondly, the PDC will broaden and strengthen the business 
base. It offers the facilities to any Salvadoran who wants to 
establish his own business. It will strengthen those who already 
own businesses and will promote mini-, small-, and medium-scale 
businessmen as well as farmers and professionals. The third axis 
of the PDC strategy is to promote productive investments. 
  The party offers to generate new and better jobs; build a 
healthy, strong, and productive economy through the creation of 
a stable macroeconomic framework; promote an honest system of 
economic incentives; and increase public and private savings 
nationwide. It also proposes programs to promote the productive 
use of remittances and the participation of the private sector 
in areas like energy and communications. 
  The policies proposed to promote productive investment 
include a broadening of financial reform, including the creation 
of a special financial system to meet the needs of farmers and 
small-, and medium-scale businesses. The following existing 
organizations, Agricultural Development Bank, FIGAPE [expansion 
unknown], Credit Federation, and all nongovernmental 
organizations that grant credit to the sector, would comprise 
this system. It proposes defining and implementing a 
comprehensive industrialization and productive reorganization 
policy and special programs to promote foreign investment. 
<H5>  Points by Sector </H5>
  The PDC platform emphasizes the importance of modernizing 
and 
diversifying agriculture by creating the National Agricultural 
Council, which would represent the sector tasked with defining 
national agricultural policy. 
  The PDC offers to reform state-owned institutions related to 
the agricultural sector. This reform would seek to decentralize 
agricultural support services and modernize its institutions. It 
seeks to find realistic and viable solutions to banking and 
agricultural problems and farmers who suffered the effects of 
the armed conflict. This policy seeks to comply with the 
"Rehabilitation of Production Sectors Affected By the Armed 
Conflict Law." 
  The PDC offers to implement a comprehensive policy to 
promote 
agricultural exports, privatize state-owned assets related to 
the agricultural sector by granting privileges to small- and 
medium- scale farmers and cooperative member associations, and 
promote a comprehensive policy of technical and technological 
assistance in this sector. 
  The government strategy proposes strengthening a special 
financial system for the business sector through modern methods 
that are in keeping with characteristics and the beginning of 
production reorganization to increase competitiveness in the 
face of foreign competition, including measures like: 
  -- Short-term financing for working capital and medium- and 
long- term financing for the acquisition of machinery and 
equipment in favorable conditions. 
  -- the development of business training programs. 
  -- the application of a human resources program in this 
sector. 
  The plan includes establishing a professional training 
program with post-graduate scholarships and financing for 
companies that offer professional and consultation services. It 
suggests implementing scientific-technological strategies 
focused on the private sector, government, and academic 
institutions to promote the creation and strengthening of 
professional associations. 
<H5>  External Sector </H5>
  The PDC proposes to promote exports by creating a joint 
organization between GOES [expansion unknown] and the private 
sector which would be tasked with coordinating and implementing 
the export policy. It calls for the establishment of adequate 
macroeconomic incentives (stable and realistic exchange rates as 
well as timely financial resources). Also, the creation of an 
international network to promote the country's export offers and 
the establishment of a productive reorganization program to 
support the sectors that were and will be affected by the 
commercial liberalization process.

  [Text] ARENA's [Nationalist Republican Alliance] government 
program for the 20 March elections offers to create appropriate 
conditions for transforming El Salvador into a country of 
opportunities and fairness; to consolidate democracy by making 
individual rights the foundation; and to uphold the principles 
of a free, just, and united society. The action plan is 
presented in four functional areas: 
<H5>  Political Area </H5>
  Within the framework of a new culture of peace and 
democracy, 
ARENA proposes to coordinate legislative actions, strengthen the 
judiciary, modernize the public sector, and ensure municipal 
development. The party proposes to coordinate education programs 
for peace and democracy through the Ministry of Education in 
coordination with the judicial branch, the Office of the Human 
Rights Ombudsman, and other offices, as well as guaranteeing the 
development of freedom in all its manifestations. 
  ARENA offers to promote the independence of municipal 
governments so they can participate in the development of their 
communities. It proposes to support the advancement of the 
Legislative Assembly's technical and administrative capabilities 
so it can respond to a free society. 
  ARENA suggests a foreign policy that will protect the 
country's interests and the welfare of all Salvadorans living 
abroad; a foreign policy that will be analogous to Central 
American integration. 
  The public official morality bill would be modified and the 
state administrative financial systems would be modernized to 
prevent illegal enrichment and the abuse of power at all levels 
and all institutions of the public sector. 
<H5>  State of Law and Public Safety </H5>
  ARENA offers to continue improving the entire legal system, 
especially by reviewing the entire legal process and modernizing 
the judicial branch, the justice ministry, and other agencies 
involved. It would create effective instruments to prevent and 
fight crime and upgrade scientific investigation systems in 
connection with respecting human dignity as consecrated in the 
Constitution of the Republic. 
  It offers to consolidate the police modernization process to 
guarantee citizen security; proclaim citizen rights and duties, 
including applicable laws; and guarantee the right to property, 
administration of justice, and citizen security. 
<H5>  Economic Development </H5>
  ARENA intends to modernize government institutions to 
guarantee greater efficiency and responsibility; centralize 
public administration to do away with bureaucracy; privatize 
government organizations that should not be managed by 
government; and maintain a monetary and fiscal discipline to 
ensure proper public spending. 
  It offers to strengthen the financial system to protect the 
people's savings and guarantee the system's efficient 
operations; to increase public investments with an emphasis on 
personnel training; and to protect consumers by guaranteeing the 
quality, weight, and measure of products and by implementing 
supervision mechanisms. 
  The party proposes to gradually reduce tariff and nontariff 
barriers and promote agricultural and industrial conversions to 
increase competitiveness and exports. 
<H5>  Social Development </H5>
  ARENA intends to modernize social programs in the health, 
education, and housing sectors by decentralizing them and 
training communities and beneficiaries to participate in their 
implementation. It will reinforce programs that promote equal 
opportunities by training personnel in the informal sector, the 
micro and small business sectors, and the peasant sector. 
  The party will suggest social programs to attack the causes 
of poverty at its roots and increase workers productivity with 
new technology and opportunities. It plans to change municipal 
governments so they can identify problems, implement solutions, 
and assign resources. It also suggests that nongovernmental 
organizations and the private sector carry out development 
programs in the communities. 
  The health and education budgets will be strengthened. 
Income 
will be redistributed to focus on those sectors and direct 
subsidies will be assigned. Property ownership will be 
facilitated by simplifying procedures and giving credit in a 
timely manner. 
  ARENA offers to modernize the social security system by 
improving its quality and coverage. It proposes an environmental 
strategy and policies to ensure that land be used properly and 
according to its properties. It offers to strengthen the micro 
and small business sectors so they increase in number, improve 
in competitiveness, and boost participation in the market. Youth 
programs will be created to combat drug addiction and crime. 
  ARENA offers to implement this government program based on 
the following actions: subsidies, decentralization, 
participation, solidarity, progress, and specific actions.

  [Text] The Army has reiterated it opposes the creation of a 
truth commission, Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez Morales 
has stated. The ranking officer said, "I would like to banish 
the topic altogether, although it may be debated in the future." 
  Enriquez Morales, who is accompanying the president on a 
visit to Mexico, said that, despite the imminent signing of an 
overall agreement on human rights, the question of creating a 
truth commission is dubious because it would depend on what is 
to be decided in the next round of negotiations. 
  The Army's position remains unchanged; it cannot accept the 
creation of the truth commission for reasons already explained. 
According to the defense minister, the accord on human rights is 
wide-ranging and is not limited to this issue. In addition, 
General Enriquez Morales announced Guatemalan troops were 
deployed along the border with Belize to protect 20 families 
that are reportedly being harassed by Belizean soldiers trying 
to expel them from the area. 
  The 20 families live in an area known as "Rio Blanco," and 
they claim they are under pressure to evacuate the area. He 
added that in addition to protecting them, the Army's mission 
also seeks to determine whether the area they occupy 
is considered a nature preserve. 
  He concluded his remarks by noting that during his stay in 
Mexico he will be meeting with his Mexican counterpart, and he 
ruled out he will offer support in combating the Zapatist 
guerrillas.

  [Text] David Heathcoat-Amory, UK deputy secretary of state 
for foreign and commonwealth affairs, met with Bernardo Arevalo, 
then-acting deputy foreign minister, on 15 March. 
Heathcoat-Amory asked the Guatemalan official about the recent 
letter of reservation sent to the UN secretary general, within 
the framework of national reclamations over Belize. 
  Arevalo said the nonspecific portion of the letter was 
addressed, adding the UK official requested an expansion of the 
existing information on the official reservation the country has 
made before the important organization. 
  "The requested information was explained to them, and the 
issue was not further elaborated," the official explained. 
Arevalo also reported the points of the bilateral agenda 
discussed with Heathcoat-Amory during the meeting. 
  He said among the topics of discussion was the so-called San 
Jose X Meeting between Central America and the European Union, 
which will be held in Athens. Arevalo remarked Foreign Minister 
Marithza Ruiz de Vielman will participate in the meeting, 
because it will take place within the framework of the foreign 
ministers meeting of both blocs to discuss economic and 
cooperation matters. 
  In addition, during the meeting Heathcoat-Amory and Arevalo 
exchanged letters establishing the elimination of visa 
requirements for tourists traveling to and from the United 
Kingdom to Guatemala. 
  The UK official's activities also included the inauguration 
of the Anglo-Guatemalan Institute, as well as visits to the 
Defense Ministry chief of staff, the human rights ombudsman, and 
the head of the Government Peace Commission.

  [Excerpt] President Ramiro De Leon Carpio warned that 
"towns will not be allowed to go without civilian or military 
authorities." He was referring to Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa, 
Escuintla, and San Lucas Toliman municipalities, Solola 
Department, whose residents seek the withdrawal of security 
forces. 
  Upon returning from a three-day trip to Mexico, De Leon 
Carpio attributed the residents' dissatisfaction with the 
authorities to several causes, including social corruption, and 
the fact that justice is not properly managed. The president 
explained that many of the irregularities that delay law 
enforcement will be corrected when the new Penal Code goes into 
effect, but he emphasized that the problem lies not only in the 
laws but in the human element as well. 
  We have training programs for law enforcement personnel 
which 
will guarantee a change in the current situation, but there are 
other elements outside justice management that prevent the 
normal governing of the country. 
  The people's discontent in those areas where the security 
forces have been asked to withdraw is understandable if we 
consider that the citizens' attitudes are affected by other 
factors such as poverty, injustice, and social disorder. 
  The president described his trip to Mexico as positive in 
every respect and said he worked with a full agenda for several 
exhausting but satisfying days to achieve the benefits obtained 
for our country. [passage omitted]

  [Text] General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir has described the 
possible approval of voluntary military service proposed by 
President Carlos Roberto Reina as "total destruction" of the 
Armed Forces. The military chief explained that Hondurans are 
not ready for such a step because they do not have enough 
education and culture, aside from the fact that it would weaken 
the Armed Forces. 
  When asked if that meant he opposed the approval of the new 
recruiting system, he reiterated that "it is the institution's 
destruction," adding that not only the military but all 
Hondurans are against it. He said it is necessary to change 
recruitment practices and suggested that the Civil Registry 
provide a list of citizens who are over 18 years of age. "There 
are so many young people in the appropriate age bracket that we 
would only need 3 to 4 percent of them," he said. 
  Concerning the privatization of the Honduran 
Telecommunications Enterprise (Hondutel) -- which is of great 
interest to President Reina -- Gen. Discua said that "as general 
commander of the Armed Forces, we must support him; otherwise, 
we would be disloyal." This answer by the military chief is 
contradictory inasmuch as he has voiced opposition to the new 
recruitment system proposed by President Reina. 
  He explained that the Armed Forces do not have any direct 
involvement in the administration of Hondutel with the exception 
of the fact that it is managed by a military officer. Actually, 
the company is governed by a board of directors chaired by the 
communications, public works, and transportation minister, 
Discua noted. 
  The military chief said that the money circulating in the 
nation's drug market is far exceeds the national budget of a 
country such as Honduras. He reported that the Police, Army, 
Air Force, and Navy are conducting joint operations that have 
led to the arrest of drug traffickers and the seizure of large 
amounts of drugs. He added that efforts have been intensified, 
particularly in Islas de la Bahia, which has become a key point 
for drug contraband. 
  Discua said he could neither confirm nor deny charges by a 
former judge that the traditional political parties paid for 
their campaigns with drug money because he does not have any 
information to that effect. 
  According to the high-ranking officer, Health Minister 
Enrique Samayoa is very poorly informed when he says that the 
Armed Forces' budget has been increased. "I think he has been 
confused by a UN report that dates back to 1993 and which talks 
about nonexistent amounts of money," Discua stated. "I do not 
understand why the figures were handled in that way. Perhaps 
they sought to confuse the public," he added. 
  The general, who arrived yesterday morning at the 105th 
Military Brigade in San Pedro Sula to attend the seminar of the 
Permanent Committee for Emergencies (Copeco), also referred to 
the complicated issue of the whereabouts of the 7 million 
lempiras received following Hurricane Gert. He said a 
government-appointed commission is investigating the case.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 18 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina is facing the second altercation of his 
administration with the 71-deputy majority of the Liberal Party 
of Honduras [PLH] over the lack of public administration jobs 
for thousands of political activists. 
  Several deputies are disturbed by the lack of communication 
with Reina, as they explained in a letter sent to his brother, 
Mario Reina, who works next to the president's office. 
  Shortly after Reina was elected president on 28 November 
1993, the deputies challenged him in a struggle for the 
presidency of the legislative branch, a position won by Carlos 
Flores, a politician who leads the most conservative faction 
within the PLH. 
  Reina wanted to place his brother, Jorge Arturo Reina, at 
the 
head of the legislative body, but most deputies supported Carlos 
Flores, presidential hopeful for the 1997 presidential 
elections. In the end, Jorge Reina was elected Congress vice 
president. The loss of leadership in Congress weakened 
President Reina's administration. 
  Santiago David Amador, chief of the PLH legislative wing, 
sent a letter to Mario Reina stating the "need to immediately 
establish the communication and dialogue agreed upon by the 
president of the Republic and the president of Congress." 
  "I must say that the apprehension of my fellow deputies is 
increasing to the point that if no immediate decision is made, 
it would be very difficult for us to harmonize relations between 
our party's legislative wing and the executive branch," the 
letter adds. 
  Reina is having difficulties in obtaining approximately $1.5 
million to pay the employees who will be dismissed, which keeps 
PLH supporters from occupying those public posts. 
  A few days ago the president was confronted with a 
demonstration in front of his house, where some PLH supporters 
threatened to withdraw from the party's future campaigns. 
  Deputy Roberto Micheletti of the pro-Flores faction on 
Thursday accused Reina's private secretary Luicio Izaguirre of 
being "a clown who only cheered like a cheerleader" in the 
political campaign rallies. 
  PLH Deputy Victoria Contreras, also a pro-Flores deputy, 
accused Mario Reina of not honoring a pact "to place" her 
supporters "in public posts." 
  Deputy Santiago Amador said this is not a confrontation 
between Congress and the executive but that "blanks are being 
fired to convey a message." In practice, however, it has 
created a new dispute between the two state branches. 
  Every four years in Honduras, the party that wins the 
elections usually fires the employees of the losing party to 
give jobs to its supporters. 
  The government is the largest employer in the country, with 
a 
payroll of some 40,000 public servants.

  [Text] A serious impasse between the government and the 
rearmed groups of the 3-80 Northern Front was overcome yesterday. 
  The demobilized members of the 3-80 Northern Front, 
following 
orders from its Council of Commanders headed by Jose Angel 
Talavera Alaniz, alias El Chacal, had decided to suspend their 
disarmament because the government was unable to fulfill its 
promises made during the disarmament negotiations. It 
definitely created a serious concern among the political, 
economic, and social circles that see in the 3-80 Northern Front 
the most serious threat to the Nicaraguan peace process. 
  Salvador Talavera Alaniz, alias Esteban, brother of Jose 
Angel Talavera, El Chacal, who was the political leader of the 
armed group for a long time, said they were able to reach a 
compromise with the Government Ministry to fulfill the 
agreements reached in Quilali last week when the first meetings 
between the 3-80 Northern Front Council of Commanders and the 
Government Ministry began. 
  Now that the impasse has been overcome, the former armed 
groups will be able to purchase the lands they need. The former 
armed groups need more than 1,300 manzanas of lands to return to 
civilian life.

  [Text] Managua, 19 Mar (DPA) -- The 3-80 Northern Front, 
the largest group of armed rebels in Nicaragua since the 
disarmament of the Nicaraguan Resistance (contras), announced 
today after a series of agreements were reached with President 
Violeta Chamorro's government it will continue the disarmament 
process. 
  Jose Angel Talavera (El Chacal), the rebels' leader, said in 
Managua next week his men, estimated at more than 200, will 
continue to turn in their weapons in the Quilali region, 
approximately 320 km north of Managua. 
  The armed group suspended the disarmament process last week, 
fearing the government would not meet its commitments. Talavera 
said he hopes this time the government will meet its commitment 
with the demobilized, adding on previous occasions it had not. 
  The government offered a series of social benefits for the 
contras' disarmament; nevertheless, there are constant protests 
against the government's lack of fulfillment.

<F P=106> [Report by Arnulfo Barroso Watson] </F>
  [Text] Panama hopes the European Union's [EU] refusal to 
accept the dates proposed to begin its compliance with GATT is a 
result of technical problems rather than political problems 
linked to Panama's position in the international banana dispute. 
  Yesterday, Carlos Gonzalez Ramirez, Panamanian ambassador to 
the GATT Secretariat said Panama has proposed two dates in March 
to begin meetings that will open the way for the nation's entry 
into GATT. The dates were accepted by all member-nations except 
the EU. 
  Gonzalez Ramirez said the EU's decision has delayed Panama's 
admittance into GATT, adding that the EU position is "greatly" 
coincidential, considering Panama maintains a decisive position 
in Latin American's struggle against some European countries' 
decision to establish controls on banana imports from the region. 
  He said: "This may or may not be the case. We will have to 
wait a few days and see what this is all about." 
  EU members say they thought Panama wanted to begin the GATT 
meetings in May, adding that it would be difficult to hold the 
meetings before that time because the Europeans will be very 
busy finalizing the Uruguay Round agreements. 
  Panama is expected to negotiate standards issues with all 
member- nations at the first meeting, and it will discuss 
bilateral tariff agreements at the second meeting. 
  Gonzalez Ramirez said the EU's decision represents a one and 
one- half month delay in Panama's plans for admittance into 
GATT. He added that the nation's entry into GATT could be 
further aggravated by the need to present a report on the 
results of its GATT negotiations to the National Assembly before 
15 April 1995. He also said the GATT Secretariat headquartered 
in Geneva, Switzerland, believes the meeting could be held on 19 
or 20 March, although Panama would prefer to meet before that 
date.

for Peace leader Lucius Walker at a meeting with members of the 
Third United States-Cuba Friendship Caravan on 18 March; place 
not given; Castro speaks in Spanish with passage-by-passage 
translation into English; Walker speaks in English with 
passage-by-passage translation into Spanish -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Castro] What did they seize? A parabolic antenna, a 
truck? Were you bringing nuclear weapons in them? [laughter] 
Intercontinental missiles? What was the truck they stopped 
carrying? 
  [Walker] The satellite dish is a 10-foot satellite dish, 
which was regarded by U.S. Customs and those who decide in 
Washington what should or should not come to Cuba, as very high 
technology. [laughter] We had two electric typewriters. 
  [Castro] Did they also seize them? 
  [Walker] Yes. That is high technology. [laughter] 
  [Castro] Do they not know we have many power outages, and 
that it is better to use a manual typewriter? 
  [Walker] The most interesting item they kept, among those 
they say we could not bring in, was a small toaster. [laughter] 
You see, you put the bread in, then plug it in; the bread gets 
toasted and pops up. A simple toaster -- they did not let it 
through. 
  When I went to the Sierra Maestra and saw pictures of the 
first attack, the routes you used when you came down the 
mountain, and the weapons used to attack the garrison, I decided 
you must have had soldiers as good as the soldiers of this 
caravan. They are truly good people. However, the main thing 
about them is that they are all inspired by the love, 
revolutionary fervor, and example of solidarity that Cuba 
provides, and by the heroic leadership of Commander Fidel 
Castro. [applause] 
  [Castro] We need to adopt measures to adopt to the 
circumstances under which we are living. [sentence as heard] 
Under these difficult circumstances, we need to seek formulas 
that can help us emerge from this special period, but without 
compromising our principles, without compromising the 
Revolution, and without compromising our independence. You know 
quite well that there are values that cannot be lost. [Passage 
indistinct] even life. [Passage indistinct] for peace because 
you know that history is full of martyrs. [Passage indistinct] 
of ideas. This is why we are meeting here. [applause] 
  We, through resistance, [words indistinct] for the life of 
ideas, morale under the present situation, struggle, continue 
working, do not lose our optimism, and trust confidence. We 
believe that our effort will also be fruitful in the material 
sphere. This is very difficult because of all these things I 
have been explaining. Very hard. However, we do not lose hope 
that we will eventually overcome this. We do not lose our hope 
of winning. We are willing to resist as long as these blockades 
last. 
  What we are saying is easy to say but hard to do because we 
have to deal with millions of people, millions of human beings 
who are making sacrifices everyday, suffering everyday; whose 
morale, commitment, and fighting spirit we must try to keep 
high. This is why I say that to work and struggle under the 
present conditions is very difficult. 
  Someone said that faith can move mountains, and we are 
witnessing that here. [applause] Faith in what is fair keeps us 
moving mountains. We shall continue moving mountains. This is 
the reason for the tremendous gratitude which I, as well as all 
the people, feel for your efforts and struggle, for your courage 
and heroism. There is more than physical heroism, there is a 
type of heroism which is even more difficult: moral heroism. 
  Inside the United States, you are giving a great example of 
moral heroism by organizing this movement and waging this 
struggle. You are fighting at the most strategic site -- inside 
the United States. We also appreciate that you are gaining 
ground, you are being successful, and are creating a greater 
awareness of this struggle. You are also writing an 
unforgettable page in the history of relations between our two 
nations, in the history of brotherhood between the American and 
Cuban peoples. In our view, you are the representatives of the 
best of the tradition, history, and virtues of the American 
people. It is in this sense that a great mountain has been 
growing, in this case of love and gratitude for what you are 
doing. 
  I did not want under any circumstances to fail to meet with 
you for a few minutes.

  [Text] Havana, 17 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Cuba confirmed today its 
denial of an alleged Colombian guerrilla "summit" in Havana 
after the government of the South American country stated it had 
"firm indications" of the encounter. 
  "It is all false; it is untrue a guerrilla summit was held 
in 
Cuba," Jose Ramon Balaguer, who is in charge of international 
relations of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo, told 
NOTIMEX. 
  Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin said on Thursday in 
Santa Fe de Bogota she had requested an official explanation 
from Cuba in light of the "firm indications" she had of the 
meeting, although President Cesar Gaviria subsequently explained 
the request was being processed. 
  President Cesar Gaviria added Colombia's relations with Cuba 
now depend on Havana's response to the petition for an 
explanation on the case. 
  the Cuban Foreign Ministry on Thursday morning denied having 
received the note mentioned by Sanin. 
  "We hold in high esteem our relations with Colombia, and in 
no way could something of that sort have occurred," Balaguer 
said regarding the alleged meeting. 
  The political leader said the version of the meeting 
published in the Colombian daily EL TIEMPO is "an attempt to mar 
relations" between the two nations, which "were being developed 
earnestly and can continue to develop." 
  The media report on a meeting in the Cuban capital among 
Colombian guerrillas was published five months after the two 
nations had resumed diplomatic relations. 
  The media version followed the announcement made by the 
Colombian Government on negotiations that will lead to the sale 
of 15,000 to 20,000 barrels of petroleum to Cuba, which for 
three decades has been under a U.S. trade embargo.

  [Text] During a telephone conversation with Colombian 
Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, Cuban President Fidel Castro 
denied reports from Bogota about a recent meeting held in Havana 
with Colombian guerrillas. Fidel Castro stated that neither 
Alfonso Cano, Ivan Marquez, nor Bishop Nel Beltran were present 
at the solidarity meeting held in Havana on 27 and 28 January as 
the Bogota newspaper EL TIEMPO falsely reported.

  [Text] Brigadier General Fernando Tapia, chief of Military 
Intelligence Services of the Colombian Armed Forces, has denied 
the existence of a secret document on an alleged guerrilla 
summit in Havana, Cuba, in January. The Military Intelligence 
Services institution has asked EL TIEMPO, a Bogota daily, to 
explain a report published Friday stating Monsignor Nel Beltran 
attended the alleged meeting. Gen. Tapia said the newspaper's 
report is not in line with any document prepared by Military 
Intelligence Services and therefore such a document could not 
have been delivered to the media.

  [Text] Cuban and Indian Foreign Ministers Roberto Robaina 
and Dinesh Singh in New Delhi discussed several subjects 
referring to bilateral issues, scientific and techncial 
exchange, and the situation of the Nonaligned Movement. 
  During the meeting, the Cuban foreign minister said that 
there are many links uniting the two nations, which must take 
concrete steps and find a common space to strengthen commercial 
relations. 
  The Indian foreign minister said he has great respect for 
the 
Cuban people, and added that, as on previous occasions, his 
country will continue supporting Cuba in the international 
forums. He also conveyed his admiration for Cuban progress in 
the areas of health and education and the country's resistance 
to current economic difficulties. 
  Shortly after those talks, Robaina also met with some 60 
Indian businessmen at the New Delhi Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry. During this meeting, the Indian businessmen expressed 
interest in the possibilities of investmenting in Cuba in the 
areas of biotechnology, pharmaceutical industry, tourism, 
textiles, agriculture, and vaccines. 
  Robaina also participated in an act of solidarity with Cuba 
when religious groups and other representatives of associations 
of friendship with our country reaffirmed their support for the 
Cuban revolutionary process and condemned the blockade.

  [Text] After arriving in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the Cuban 
delegation headed by Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
visited the South Investment, Trade, and Technology Data 
Exchange Center [SITTDEC] for developing countries of which Cuba 
is now an official member. Reporter Rey Rodriguez of the 
information services of Cuban Television has more details: 
  [Rodriguez] In a news conference held after Cuba's entry 
into 
the SITTDEC, Robaina underscored the importance that Cuba's 
entry represents. 
  [Begin Robaina recording] We already had an idea of the 
possibilities offered by the center. That is why we came here to 
the institution's headquarters, after Cuba's official 
incorporation. We have had the privilege of becoming the 15th 
member country, since until recently there were only 14 member 
countries. In a modest way Cuba has much to offer in many areas 
such as the medical field, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, 
sugar, tobacco, coffee, rum, nickel, and in many things that 
from an economic standpoint could be useful to several 
countries. [end recording] 
  [Rodriguez] Tomorrow, the Cuban delegation is scheduled to 
meet with Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Haji Ahmad 
Badawi, and the minister of primary industries, as well as a 
meeting in the Ministry of Youth and Sports due to Malaysia's 
interest in obtaining Cuban training in that area. The 
delegation will also meet with a group of businessmen. 
  On 21 March, the delegation will depart for Vietnam, the 
final stop of a tour through the Asian Continent.

  [Text] Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Haji Ahmad 
Badawi acknowledged, in a meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina, that Cuba is clearly making progress and that 
under no pretext should anyone exert pressure on that country. 
  Robaina arrived in the Malaysian capital yesterday from 
India. In an exchange, his counterpart reiterated that it is the 
Cubans who alone must determine their fate -- an allusion to the 
U.S. policy against Cuba. The Malaysian foreign minister also 
expressed his satisfaction with the Cuban Foreign Ministry's new 
policy of rapprochement with the region, and stressed that he is 
willing to form a businessmen's delegation to visit Havana over 
the next few months to increase trade between the two nations. 
  Robaina agreed with the Malaysian foreign minister on the 
need to take practical steps toward progress in the world of 
communication. Robaina said: We are here to learn about and 
assess the experiences of countries that, like this one, have 
enjoyed sustained development.

  [Text] Many international news agencies have reported from 
Washington that scores of influential political figures 
participated on 17 March in a heated debate at the U.S. Congress 
on the appropriateness of the United States' maintaining the 
blockade against Cuba, an anachronism in the postwar era. 
  The law on free trade with Cuba, a proposal submitted by New 
York Democratic Party Representative Charles Rangel, with the 
support of most black and Hispanic congressmen, was the subject 
that prompted fiery deliberations at a House of Representatives 
Ways and Means subcommittee. 
  The Spanish television station Univision last night reported 
that this subject prompted one of the most bitter debates with 
conflicting arguments expressed by supporters and opponents of 
the blockade. 
  It is time to put an end to the Cold War because 34 years of 
blockade against Cuba have not yielded the expected results, 
Rangel said, defending free trade among nations. 
  His stance was also supported by California Democratic Party 
Representative Esteban Torres, who termed sanctions against 
Havana as ineffective and anachronistic. The following 
congressmen also supported this stance: Jose Serrano from New 
York, Bernard Sanders from Vermont, and politicians such as 
Reverend Jesse Jackson and other supporters of an end to the 
blockade who were also present at the session at the Capitol. 
  Grouped on the opposite side were figures of the anti-Cuban 
extreme right such as Robert Torricelli from New Jersey, Lincoln 
Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen from Florida, and Jorge Mas 
Canosa, head of the ultraconservative Cuban-American National 
Foundation. Officials from the Department of State who also 
support the continuation of the blockade were also present at 
the 17 March session.

  [Text] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of Cuba's 
legislature, said today that the most important contribution of 
Charles Rangel's bill calling for lifting the blockade against 
Cuba is that it opens debate on the issue in the U.S. Congress. 
  Alarcon, an expert on Cuban-U.S. relations, said that the 
beginning of congressional committee discussion of the blockade 
from the point of view of those who wish to eliminate it is an 
important step. In statements to the news agency PRENSA LATINA, 
Alarcon said, with reference to the third Pastors for the Peace 
caravan that is currently in Cuba, that the convoy is a very 
important example of how solidarity with Cuba is growing, even 
within the United States.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon; from the "Evening </F>
Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] Health should not be used as a political weapon. 
This statement acquired unheard of implications when it was 
pronounced on 17 March on the floor of the House of 
Representatives of the United States, the nation that has held 
an economic blockade, which includes food supplies and 
medicines, against Cuba for the past three decades. 
  The demand was presented by (Julie Finesilver) in her 
argument against the U.S. siege against Cuba on the occasion of 
a draft bill submitted by Democrat Charles Rangel. The 
presentation by (Finesilver), a pharmaceutical company 
consultant, was the one, among various speakers who participated 
before a House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee 
subcommission, that caused a great impact. During a marathon 
session in which tens of interventions, which also included 
positions supporting the blockade against Cuba, were heard, the 
insistence of solid arguments, such as those of Congressman Jose 
Serrano and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, were evident in 
favor of a rational handling of the island. [sentence as heard] 
  The debate was a solid reflection of the weakened influence 
of followers of the so-called Torricelli Law, which is aimed at 
intensifying the blockade's impact on 11 million Cubans. 
Politicians, businessmen, representatives of the Cuban community 
residents in the United States, and other individuals went to 
the podium to speak in favor of or against the blockade; 
nevertheless, the idea that the Unites States suffers steep 
economic losses as its hostility against Cuba prevails was 
emphatically reiterated. 
  One of the most objective arguments was that of (Finesilver) 
who, when she displayed a box of PPG [expansion unknown], pills 
used in Cuba to lower cholesterol levels, expressed regret the 
box was empty, because the blockade prevents North American 
citizens from acquiring the product despite its international 
recognition. 
  A devastating truth was felt in the room when the speaker 
stated Cuban and North American scientists could work together 
if the blockade were lifted. Only because there is a trend in 
the United States in favor of lifting the inhuman measures, only 
because of this did the U.S. House of Representatives begin 
debating such a conflictive issue. Irrefutable opinions such as 
those of Mrs. (Finesilver) were heard at that time.

  [Text] Several U.S. sectors have indicated that U.S. 
President Clinton maintains the U.S. blockade on Cuba because he 
considers it of strategic importance in obtaining the votes in 
the State of Florida for his reelection in 1996. Nevertheless, 
a recent survey indicates that 40 percent of Hispanic residents 
in Miami favor the lifting of the U.S. blockade.

<F P=106> [Interview via telephone with U.S. Congressman Charles </F>
Rangel by Roberto Cavada and Ana Margarita Gill on the "Doing 
Radio" program -- live, passages in quotes are in English] 
  [Text] [Cavada] For some days now we have been trying to 
make an international call to U.S. Congressman Charles Rangel, 
who just two days ago presented a bill to the Congress to 
establish free trade between the United States and Cuba. From a 
hotel in Miami I have Mr. Charles Rangel on the line, who will 
give an international news conference. Ana Margarita Gill will 
serve as interpreter for us and for Mr. Rangel. From Havana, 
good morning. 
  [Gill] "Good morning, Mr. Rangel. We are calling you from 
Havana Cuba, and we would like to ask you about details 
concerning your projects to ease or establish free commerce 
between Cuba and the United States. 
  [Rangel] "Well, as you know, the U.S. has always felt that 
Cuba with association with the Soviet Union represented a threat 
to our national security and as a result of that it established 
the embargo some 34 years ago. It is my opinion and that of many 
members of the Congress that that threat no longer exists if it 
existed at all and that the embargo should be removed. I had 
hearings on this bill, and we have had many people in the 
Congress to agree. And I think that with all the witnesses, 
there is an overwhelming belief that the purposes that existed 
for the embargo before do not exist now and that it should be 
removed. 
  "The problems that we do have is that there are many people 
in the United States who believe that the rights of Cuban people 
to speak their minds and the terms of the type of government 
that they would have are held in jeopardy if they speak out 
against the Cuban Government. The Cuban Government, of course, 
says that this is not so, that people do have the opportunity to 
say anything that they want, and so, therefore, I think that now 
that we have established an area of differences that we also can 
establish an area of debate and that is exactly where we are at 
this moment. 
  [Gill] "Thank you so much I will translate for a few 
seconds." He states that the embargo, or the blockade, is 
established due to relations between Cuba and the United States. 
At the present moment this situation has changed completely, and 
if there is an area of differences there should also be an area 
of dialogue and mutual exchange. 
  [Cavada] The listeners would like to know about the future 
of 
your bill. What other steps would be followed because the Cuba 
people are interested in learning of this future. 
  [Gill] "Mr. Rangel, which will be the next steps in Congress 
concerning the project? 
  [Rangel] "Well, since there is an overwhelming feeling that 
the embargo has nothing to do with the security of the United 
States and since many of the business people believe that indeed 
the United States is losing as a result of not participating in 
trade with Cuba, as we have established with the North America 
Free Trade Agreement, then what remains is some concern about 
the type of government and the type of conditions that exist as 
relates to the human rights of the Cubans. Of course some of us 
believe, that support the bill, that the embargo has caused an 
undo hardship in terms of lack of food and medicine, in terms of 
the pain and suffering of the people in Cuba. So, when people 
have said that many Cubans have been arrested and placed in jail 
because their only crime was to speak out in support of 
democracy, other people have said that that is not so. 
  "In my opinion, if that is not so and that is the only 
reason 
why we are not establishing trade and a normal relationship with 
Cuba so that we can enjoy each other's culture and education and 
advancements in medicine and of course in commerce, then it 
would seem that perhaps our government should start talking and 
remove what appears to be the only obstacle as relates [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Gill] "Thank you so much Mr. Rangel." 
  [Rangel] Good morning. [in Spanish] 
  [Gill] Good morning. Let us summarize what he said. He said 
that, currently, there is an overwhelming feeling about the fact 
that U.S. security has nothing to do with Cuba and that much is 
being said about the alleged violation of human rights in Cuba. 
He says that there is no greater violation than the pain and 
suffering that the embargo or blockade is causing to our people. 
That the time has come for the United States and Cuba to enjoy 
each other's culture and education and that they should sit down 
to talk. In short, that is the message of Mr. Charles Rangel.

<F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras] </F>
  [Text] The initiative by U.S. Congressman Charles Rangel in 
presenting a bill that would normalize trade relations with Cuba 
has the [words indistinct] and the courage to do so. It has also 
put on the front page the debate over whether it is advisable 
for the United States to continue following the schemes of the 
Cold War or to modify its views and values and adopt a more 
realistic policy in a different world. 
  Can any intelligent person in the United States continue 
arguing that Cuba presents or represents a threat to the 
national security of the world's greatest military power? If one 
were to make an objective analysis one would see that none of 
the conditions, claimed to have existed by nine U.S. 
Administrations in order to apply, maintain, and even strengthen 
the blockade against our country, currently exist. 
  As a matter of fact, the events that they used in the past 
were not modified to please or to acquiesce to a policy of 
pressure but as a result of factors that exclusively involve 
Cuba and the countries with whom it maintained the determined 
commitments which Washington considered dangerous for its 
security, demanding their cancellation. Our presence in Africa, 
and the presence in Cuba of some units from the former Soviet 
Union were not ended because our country was acquiescing to U.S. 
pressures, but because of sovereign decisions between the 
parties involved. 
  Maybe it was the unwavering position that Cuba has 
maintained 
and will maintain, or the sharp defense of the national 
sovereignty and our right to self determination that provoked 
anger among the leading members of the U.S. Administrations. At 
one time there was a more appropriate climate for such an 
exacerbated position. Today, it has been said that the Cold War 
is over. The Soviet Union no longer exists. There is not one 
Cuban soldier in Angola, a sovereign decision between those 
involved. 
  Today, the most fierce sectors of the counterrevolution in 
Florida are losing their influence very rapidly. An important 
sector of the Cuban emigres wants dialogue; it does not accept 
the blockade. They claim to have other values and interests. A 
more rational attitude is gaining ground among intellectuals, 
entrepreneurs, and many U.S. politicians, who do not want to 
hear anything about a Cold War, but would prefer to hear of 
trade, mutual interests, trips, and tourism. 
  The fact that such important events coincide is not casual, 
but neither is it premeditated. While the bill is presented to 
Congress to normalize trade relations with Cuba -- in other 
words, end the blockade and the Torricelli Law -- the U.S.-Cuba 
Friendship Caravan is among us after successfully completing 
their mission of peace and solidarity. 
  I do not believe the Rangel bill will be passed by Congress. 
But, it is a sign of a changing view that gains strength in the 
United States and that will end up isolating those with 
nostalgia for the Cold War and the big stick policy.

  [Text] Colombian Minister of Mines and Energy Guido Nule 
reiterated the decision of the Colombian Government to sell 
15,000 to 20,000 barrels of oil daily to Cuba as agreed during a 
recent visit by Nule to Havana. Nule stated: The deal stands, 
and the only thing missing is for Cuba to present the 
corresponding guarantees because we are talking about a business 
deal as any other where there is a buyer and a seller. 
  Minister Nule pointed out that Colombia sells oil to anyone 
who pays for the oil in cash and at international prices. Nule 
dismissed threats by Cuban emigre extremists in Miami, who 
threatened to boycott Colombian products in the United States in 
retaliation for selling oil to Cuba.

<F P=106> [Interview with Omar Morales, member of the Cuban delegation </F>
attending the experts' technical meeting on the creation of the 
Association of Caribbean States in Jamaica, by Bianca Elena 
Govin in Kingston, Jamaica; date not given; from the "Evening 
Information Review" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Govin] Since Wednesday, Kingston, Jamaica, has been 
the headquarters of an experts' technical meeting to further the 
establishment of the Association of Caribbean States [ACS], a 
regional organization in which Cuba will participate as a full 
member. We will now talk to diplomat Omar Morales, member of 
the Cuban delegation, to learn details of this meeting. What 
are the meeting's objectives? What countries are participating? 
What topics have been discussed up to now? 
  [Morales] The ACS's basic objectives are to further economic 
integration and operational cooperation. Those were the initial 
objectives but they have since been expanded because we have 
also talked about establishing commissions for foreign economic 
relations, trade, investments in the Caribbean region, and 
transportation. In our search for new cooperation mechanisms, 
the association's initial objectives expanded and now include 
the ones I mentioned initially, as well as the coordination of 
all the economic issues to which I have referred. 
  The current meeting is being attended by the all the 
independent Caribbean countries [words indistinct] the 25 
independent Caribbean countries and several dependent 
territories with the manifest absence of Puerto Rico and the 
Virgin Islands. They are the only ones not attending the 
conference. 
  Up to now, we have only discussed the organization's 
charter. 
We have discussed the text of the document or agreement that 
will legalize the ACS. On this issue, one of the topics that 
has prompted more attention is the participation of the 
dependent territories because there are big differences between 
all the dependent territories. Saint Martin and Montserrat are 
not the same, for example, as French Overseas Departments such 
as [word indistinct] and Guadeloupe. Each of them has very 
special characteristics, and we will have to reach specific 
participation formulas for each of them. Of course, their 
participation in the organization will be different from that of 
the independent countries. 
  Today, we continue and expect to really get into the issue 
of 
the text of the charter. Yesterday's meeting ended with the 
presentation of the Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] program, 
and today we will start to debate the text itself. This is what 
we have done up to now. 
  [Govin] In the past days, news agencies have reported that 
the topic of NAFTA, which, as we all know, was signed by the 
United States, Mexico, and Canada, is going to be debated in the 
Jamaica meeting. What can you tell us about this, taking into 
account that Mexico is a signatory of that pact and will also be 
a member of the future ACS? 
  [Morales] No, this issue has not been mentioned up to now, 
and I don't think it will be included because the ACS is not 
being established to deal with the NAFTA issue. Furthermore, 
one of the principles included in the discussions on the 
association's constitution, is that the association has to work 
to further the integration of our countries. Once we have, for 
example, an integration organization for Latin American, 
Caribbean, [word indistinct], or however you want to call it, we 
will be in a more advantageous position and could then talk to 
other blocs or associations. 
  The fact that Mexico, which has maintained a very 
constructive attitude at the meeting and is one of the countries 
that has enthusiastically furthered the establishment of the 
association, is in the [words indistinct] has no importance. 
There are many countries, such as Colombia, Venezuela, the 
Central Americans, Caricom itself, that are in the association 
and also participate in other integration mechanisms. The 
countries that already participate in integration mechanisms are 
not limited in any way because they will now participate in the 
ACS. 
  [Govin] The official constitution of the ACS is scheduled to 
be held in Barbados next July. Could you briefly give us the 
organization's characteristics and its main objectives. 
  [Morales] As I said before, the association's main objective 
is to further Latin American and Caribbean integration and an 
operative cooperation among our countries. Those are its main 
goals, and several commissions will also be created. We all 
want, despite the fact that it means a lot of hard work, to 
finish our job and officially establish the association in July. 
This obviously will require a very strong effort by all the 
member countries as July is only three and one-half months away 
and we are just starting to debate the charter. We, thus, have 
to hurry and work hard to be able to constitute the ACS in 
Barbados. It is anticipated that all the Caribbean heads of 
state will attend this event.

  [Text] The meeting of experts to draw up the document 
creating the Association of Caribbean States ended today in 
Kingston, Jamaica. The text is to be approved by the Caribbean 
summit scheduled to be held in Barbados during the first week of 
July. The document establishes the foundations and norms that 
will govern the new organization for the purpose of integration. 
  The United States exerted strong pressure for Cuba's 
exclusion from the association , but in vain.

  [Text] The first provincial plenum to sum up the proposals 
of the parliaments in the workplace was held today in Holguin. 
This assembly was presided over by Pedro Ross Leal, a member of 
the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] and secretary 
general of the CTC [Cuban Workers Federation]. The parliaments 
in the workplace had the desired effect and much more: From 
these parliaments emerged solutions that, despite a great many 
earlier meetings and assemblies, had never been forthcoming. 
  [Begin Ross recording] That is a bonus that we must get out 
of this. That experience, even if it is negative, must serve the 
purpose of making us rectify our way of zeroing in on problems, 
of confronting problems, of looking into things with the workers. 
  The point is not just to drop by the work center. The point 
is to reach the workers. And the point of reaching the workers 
is not to say hello to the workers but rather to set up a 
framework and create an atmosphere conducive to the workers' 
talking, and for us to communicate with them. [end recording] 
  At the Holguin plenum, the nation's first, the final report 
on the process was presented -- a process during which certain 
subjects were much discussed and during which different opinions 
were expressed regarding, among other things, taxes [words 
indistinct] and the prices of products in the basic family 
shopping basket. 
  A consensus was reached on matters such as the urgency of 
producing efficiently, reviewing the policy of enterprises' 
prices, eliminating undue gratuities, recovering work 
discipline, and, especially, increasing the stringency, 
monitoring, and management on the part of administrations and 
the state -- as well as what was said regarding illegal 
businesses and private production. 
  In this connection, Francisco Garcia Ferrer, first secretary 
of the PCC in Holguin, reflected: 
  [Begin Garcia recording] As party and revolutionary leaders, 
this gives us satisfaction, because we realize that the working 
class is fully aware of the fact that Cuba's solution does not 
lie in every man for himself, nor individual solutions, nor 
private solutions. And that is important. That is an ideological 
phenomenon the importance of which we must examine. Therefore, 
we cannot help but feel tranquil; feel that our working class is 
not confused, that it is very clear on things. The working class 
is aware that by struggling to produce more -- but doing so 
efficiently -- we will move forward. [end recording] 
  This has been Jorge Quevedo, reporting from Holguin 
Province.

  [Text] Yesterday in Bayamo, Politburo member Pedro Ross 
Leal, secretary general of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC], 
said the workers parliaments have expressed their support for 
economic efficiency. In a meeting to evaluate the progress of 
this process in Granma Province, which Alfredo Enriquez Pina, 
first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Granma 
Province, also attended, Ross Leal noted that the solution to 
our problems is not money but more production. He stated that as 
long as 79 percent of the country's enterprises are 
unprofitable, Cuba will not be able to improve or overcome the 
special period. He stressed that it was essential to reduce 
expenses and increase production. He pointed out that until 
production is raised we cannot think of an analysis of 
agriculture prices. He went on to say that 
agricultural-livestock workers first need to produce enough for 
themselves and for the rest of our people. 
  During this meeting to analyze the workers parliaments of 
Granma Province, it was mentioned that the Basic Cooperative 
Production Units [UBPC] have been created but the number of 
management personnel of the enterprises and delegations of the 
Ministry of the Sugar Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture 
have not been reduced. The importance of implementing a set of 
ideas previously submitted by workers was also stressed by 
participants. The solution to many of those problems can be 
found in the individual work center, municipality, or province. 
  [Begin Ross recording] On the 29th we will agree on what we 
will call the process that will follow this one, because we do 
not want the word parliament to lose its content. The name 
should express what is desired and it should be used when that 
is necessary. We are going to change the focus and the name of 
our process of assemblies of production or services. We are 
thinking that they should be assemblies to discuss economic 
efficiency in production or service centers. We must analyze 
this carefully to establish a proper name so that they are not 
used for something else, because production or services 
assemblies are good for everything except for the analysis of 
these problems. [end recording] 
  During the meeting, Pedro Ross Leal awarded a banner to 
Granma Province for being the largest contributor toward 
financing the Territorial Troops Militia [MTT] during 1993. In a 
coming contact, we will offer exclusive statements made for this 
program by comrade Ross Leal giving his personal views of the 
progress of the workers parliaments in Granma Province.

<F P=106> [Report by Santiago de Cuba correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Esteban Lazo Hernandez, member of the Politburo and 
first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Santiago 
de Cuba Province, said this afternoon that the principal 
importance of the Parliaments in the Workplace process has been 
the working class' discussion of how to save its oeuvre. He said 
this during the plenum concluding the process in the province. 
Also present at the plenum, which is underway right now at the 
municipal CTC's [Cuban Workers Federation] theater, is Pedro 
Ross, member of the Politburo and secretary general of the CTC, 
who has asked the provincial union secretaries to report on the 
main proposals made by the provincial workers at their 
respective Parliament in the Workplace assemblies. 
  [Begin Ross recording] At that assembly, they even said that 
yes, we must sell the rum at a high price, and we must sell 
cigarettes at a high price, because after all, we do have 
profiteers and we have people who buy... [pauses] that if we set 
the price at five pesos, such people would buy up the entire 
(?supply). We should therefore sell the cigarettes at 20 pesos. 
  So, then, if we wish to stop the profiteers, and if I am a 
revolutionary and wish to help the Revolution, and yet want to 
(?smoke) an extra box of cigarettes, I won't let myself... 
[pauses] (?instead of from the) profiteer, I will buy it from 
the Revolution, because that money will be used for the 
Revolution. That is one of the things the workers said. 
  And I cannot sell bottles of rum freely [por la libre]. 
Openly, the cost is some 15 pesos. If we really wish to save and 
contribute, we need to place the bottles of rum so that if I, or 
other revolutionary people, wish to drink a bottle of rum, we 
will have a place to get it where rum will cost 120, or even 130 
pesos -- just like what they sell it for in the streets -- 
because that is the only way to stop the profiteers. [end 
recording] 
  Regarding the delicate matter of rationing the work force, 
Pedro Ross explained that to date, the only sectors authorized 
to take such a step are tourism and transportation, and that it 
will never be valid without the presence of the union. 
  I reiterate, friends: The plenum at the end of the 
Parliaments in the Workplace assemblies in Santiago de Cuba 
Province is underway right now, here, with Politburo members 
Esteban Lazo Hernandez and Pedro Ross Leal in attendance.

  [Text] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], 
participated in the closing session of the workers parliament 
held at the National Center for Scientific Research, Cenic, the 
last one scheduled in the timetable for these meetings. 
  [Begin Alarcon recording] I want to say, first of all, that 
we must have a scientific approach, trying to do things 
rigorously, trying to get to the roots of the problem, as many 
have said. I can assure you that if the much ballyhooed measures 
existed in somebody's pocket -- please, give us the benefit of 
the doubt by not taking us to be so stupid as not to realize 
that the country's problems are so serious and complex that we 
have never thought of pulling those much discussed measures out 
of our pockets. This looks like a secondary issue, but it is 
not. We must be aware that these problems are not easy and 
simple; they will not be solved the day after the National 
Assembly meeting. [end recording] 
  The parliament at the Cenic was not at the level of others 
insofar as analysis of the center's efficiency is concerned, and 
Alarcon said that the most important decisions must be adopted 
in the workers parliaments. 
  [Begin Alarcon recording] I have seen measures adopted here 
by workers who do not have a dining room, who have no work 
clothes, who have no work shoes or protective gloves for 
handling harmful substances, but who have been able thoroughly 
to discuss the concrete problems of that factory or unit, to see 
ways to produce more at lower cost; or in the work centers where 
they have to pay 1.60 or 1.30 pesos a meal, they agreed to 
reduce that deficit -- because it is part of the country's 
deficit -- they agreed to pay for what they are receiving. These 
are two examples that come to my mind after participating in 
several dozen workers parliaments over the past few weeks. 
  These are concrete measures our hard working people are 
adopting at this moment; and here there are people working under 
deplorable and difficult conditions and who also produce 
products that generate currency they never see, not even from a 
distance, and who neither can have, as is the case with some 
workers of the tobacco industry, working conditions like those 
in other areas of our country. [end recording] 
  Alarcon also discussed adjustment measures implemented in 
other countries, based on reduced social expenditures and wages, 
on worker layoffs, and the closing of unprofitable companies. 
Alarcon said: 
  [Begin Alarcon recording] The essential question is this: Do 
we want this? Do we want the free, universal education program 
to be eliminated? Do we want the free, public, and universal 
health program to be eliminated? Do we want the aged, the 
retired worker, or the worker who lost his job to be abandoned? 
If that is what we want, I think we do not need workers 
parliaments or ANPP meetings, if adjustment measures are adopted 
every day. The only thing we have to do then is to take the IMF 
model and implement it; that is all. 
  In our case -- and I can tell you I am fully convinced that 
this is the opinion of the overwhelming majority of the workers 
of this country -- we can start from the basic element, that we 
must save this social project; that we must look for a socialist 
way to face this problem, and not by privatizing public 
education and health, abandoning the poor and the aged or 
disregarding their right for social solidarity, liberating 
prices, eliminating subsidies on production, etc. What will 
prevail then is the law of the jungle, which is capitalism. [end 
recording] 
  The ANPP president stressed the double objective of the 
parliaments in work places. 
  [Begin Alarcon recording] One important aspect of these 
workers parliaments, of these meetings, has been that each and 
every one has been able to express his or her opinion or point 
of view, or any idea on how to face the national, general 
problem of the country's financial situation, but also and above 
all, to analyze the specific set of problems of each center, to 
try to identify problems and solutions the unit might have, and 
especially to see that the solutions found to those problems are 
implemented. 
  I can tell you that in some of those meetings in which we 
participated we have been able to verify with satisfaction that 
more than one of those measures adopted by the workers are in 
effect. Besides -- we have been able to verify this in the area 
of tobacco -- the same factories we visited in January and in 
February, factories that through their workers parliaments began 
to discuss concrete measures to be adopted in those factories, 
today are producing 110 and 115 [figures as heard] more, 
depending on the factory, as compared to their production before 
that date. [end recording] 
  Alarcon said that we Cubans have grown accustomed to free 
and 
universal education and health programs, social security, and 
welfare. But these benefits cost the country 4.3 billion pesos 
every year. 
  [Begin recording] Much has been said about the prices of 
some 
products on the black market. And it is true. It is also true 
that supply to the market controlled by the state is 
experiencing a slump. We are all aware of this. But for many 
years, and also today, the scarce products, with very few 
exceptions, have been subsidized for many years. That is, what 
we pay for rice today is not what it costs or what the state 
pays for it, because it must be bought from elsewhere in the 
world and must be paid for in hard currencies, currencies which 
are associated with the hard currency stores but do not exist 
for hard currency stores alone, but for many other things. 
  We can also talk about bread, because many workers complain 
about the quality of bread, etc. But bread does not just fall 
from the sky as manna; it comes out of the oven, and wheat to 
become bread must be put into that oven. And wheat must be 
purchased at a price which is not what we pay for bread. Bread 
may be of poor quality and scarce, but for years these products 
have been subsidized by our society. By subsidizing that staple 
product the country has been spending more than 400 million 
pesos every year. [end recording] 
  Alarcon said that 69 percent of our industries are not 
profitable, and that keeping them in operation costs more than 
they contribute, especially since they do not have the raw 
materials or input they had before, because they have lost the 
market. However, we are not going to follow the neoliberal 
policy of closing those industries and laying off workers, 
because they are not to blame for the drop in the country's 
import capacity from more than $8 billion to $1.7 billion in 
1993. To solve the current economic situation, preserving the 
conquests of socialism, is very complex; but it is worth making 
all necessary effort. And for this reason the parliaments have 
been called in the work places. 
  These were some of the basic ideas expressed by Ricardo 
Alarcon on closing the workers parliament at the Cenic.

  [Text] The secretaries general of the Trade and Food 
Industry Workers Union [Sindicato de Comercio y Gastronomia] 
from Cuba's 14 provinces and the special municipality are 
meeting today at the CTC [Cuban Workers Federation] to evaluate 
the process of holding Parliament in the Workplace assemblies at 
work centers. In the presence of Osmany Cienfuegos, vice 
president of the Council of State, these worker leaders will 
assess how the subject of tourism was reflected during the 
meetings at which this subject was discussed by the various 
unions. 
  One of the demands of the Trade and Food Industry Workers 
Union's membership is the need to designate a more flexible 
manner in which each work group donates a portion of its tips to 
indirect workers and public health. 
  During the afternoon, Sonia Rodriguez, [minister] president 
of the State Committee for Material and Technical Supply, will 
be participating in the Parliament in the Workplace process of 
the Trade and Food Industry Workers Union at the CTC.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon] </F>
  [Text] The balance of the workers' proposals on how to make 
factories more efficient and how to improve the nation's 
finances has begun to be reported in the 14 Cuban provinces and 
the special Isle of Youth municipality today. It is immediately 
obvious that the wide array of suggestions and evaluations will 
be very useful to the parliament. This leading government 
organization last December studied measures to confront the 
negative balance of domestic finances. Prior to approving those 
measures, the organization decided to see what the consensus was 
among the people. The unions accepted the initiative and have 
held approximately 80,000 grass-roots meetings which, after 
almost three months of constant conferences to hear opinions, 
concluded this Wednesday. Following this free flow of opinions, 
it was observed that there was consensus on several possible 
measures for correcting domestic finances. Other ideas were 
widely discussed but did not receive unanimous support. Among 
the most accepted considerations were the implementation of 
actions with greater economic efficiency, the elimination of 
nonessential gratuities, the closure of nonproductive centers, 
and the implementation of monetary, fiscal, and price measures 
to face the significant fiscal deficit of 4,200 billion pesos, 
which has the same value in dollars according to the official 
rate. 
  The majority was in favor of increasing the price of 
nonessential articles and others items that are necessary but 
which have such low prices that they do not even cover 
production costs. Workers also favored measures to encourage 
savings and understood the need to implement a tax system. 
There is not much information on tax systems because they do 
not exist in Cuba, so the issue was obviously cause for concern. 
There was no consensus on a possible change of currency given 
that such a measure could be ineffective in the long run. 
Thousands of Cubans, however, proposed establishing commitments 
to freeze funds for several years. 
  These are some of the numerous considerations handled in the 
so-called parliaments in the workplace, which was the name given 
to the trade union assemblies that followed the last meeting of 
the People's Government National Assembly in December. 
  Provincial and national union leaders will today begin to 
study the proposals and ideas presented by the rank and file, a 
process that should portray more clearly the opinion of the 
majority of Cuban workers about economic matters.

  [Text] The Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces 
[Minfar] has reported that an unfortunate accident took place on 
the morning of 17 March, involving a two-seat MiG-23UB 
[alphanumeric designation as heard] aircraft carrying out a 
highly complex training flight over the territory of the Eastern 
Army. 
  Two first class pilots from Holguin Airbase died in this 
accident. They are: Major Sinecio Landa Lopez, married, and 
father of two children, and Major Jose Borrego Pajon, also 
married, who left a pregnant wife. 
  Both pilots are graduates from our aviation school in Pinar 
del Rio in 1985 and 1986. They were 36 years old, militants of 
the Cuban Communist Party, and both fulfilled internationalist 
missions in Angola. 
  The Minfar has conveyed condolences to all relatives of 
these 
two courageous pilots who died in the fulfillment of their tasks.

  [Text] How to guarantee the safety of machines and 
equipment, increase workers' competency, and achieve general 
combat readiness are the topics being discussed today by the 
Western Army's first inspection and labor protection campaign. 
For the past few months, the units of the Western Army's 
territory have been making great efforts to guarantee every 
worker the resources that will allow him to do his work with a 
maximum of security for his life. Also, existing technical 
difficulties in various types of equipment -- especially that 
used in engineering tasks -- have been solved by means of 
interesting innovations. Regrettable work accidents have thereby 
been avoided. Among those centers with best results is the 
Western Army's rearguard technical safety unit [unidad de 
aseguramiento tecnico de retaguardia], which has made over 1,800 
gloves for use in soldering or in agricultural activities. 
  Sixteen papers are being analyzed here today, selected from 
the 50 submitted at the grassroots level. A jury will choose the 
best six, which will then be presented at the Army's ninth 
science and technology forum. They will also (?be presented) in 
the campaign at the level of the [entire] Armed Forces, 
scheduled for 14 and 15 June, which happens to be the 20th 
anniversary of the [creation of the] FAR's [Revolutionary Armed 
Forces'] technical inspection and labor protection specialty.

  [Text] The presence of Professor Rodrigo Alvarez Cambras in 
Ciudad Bolivar and Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela, is proof of the 
interest on the part of Venezuela's public health leadership in 
developing aspects of holistic and sports medicine. 
  Alvarez Cambras said he had been able to hold exchanges with 
Venezuelan scholars on spinal surgery and [word indistinct] in 
ankle lesion surgery at the Social Security Hospital in Puerto 
Ordaz. 
  Alvarez, who is director of Havana's Frank Pais orthopedic 
teaching hospital, said he performed six operations and held a 
practicum workshop during which aspects of orthopedics were 
assessed. Alvarez Cambras explained that two protocols of intent 
were signed: one, on exchange of information in metallurgy and 
the development of orthopedic instruments and parts; the other, 
with the Social Security Hospital where our doctors will go 
several times a year to train specialists.

  [Text] The official agenda of the meeting President Menem 
and U.S. Vice President Al Gore are scheduled to hold the 
morning of 21 March encompasses a wide range of bilateral 
issues, but it does not include the most controversial one: 
U.S. pressure for the approval of a new patents law in 
Argentina. Nevertheless, a high-ranking Argentine Foreign 
Ministry source, who is well-versed on diplomatic rules, 
explained: "The fact that the issue is not included on the 
agenda does not mean it will not be discussed." 
  Preparations for Gore's visit included a 30-minute meeting 
in 
Buenos Aires between Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella and U.S. 
Ambassador Cheek and a meeting in Washington between Argentine 
Ambassador Raul Granillo Ocampo with the U.S. vice president's 
advisory team. "Controversial issues have been exempted from 
the agenda (...). The patents law issue has been rejected 
because it is believed this is an excessively technical issue 
and all the points have been made." 
  When he presented his credentials, Ambassador Cheek took the 
trouble to explain that the main priority on his agenda was to 
pressure for the prompt approval of a new patents law that would 
specifically recognize the intellectual property of U.S. 
laboratories. Moreover, representatives from Bill Clinton's 
administration have threatened to include Argentina on the list 
of countries that deserve to have economic sanctions imposed for 
violating intellectual property. 
  The list of these countries will be disclosed on 30 April, 
that is, one month and 10 days after Gore's arrival in Buenos 
Aires. The U.S. vice president will travel to Buenos Aires to 
attend a UN-sponsored world telecommunications conference. He 
is scheduled to dine with Menem on Sunday [20 March] evening. 
They will see each other again on 21 March, and during this 
meeting the official agenda will not necessarily be respected.

  "What was signed with one hand cannot be erased with the

  In December 1993, 117 countries -- including the United

of intellectual property rights within the framework of the 
Uruguay Round of GATT talks, which included the issue of 
medicine patents. 
  This agreement, for which both our country and your country 
have actively worked, sets precise international medicine patent 
norms. 
  Consequently, we do not understand the reason for the 
continued threat of commercial sanctions and preconditions for 
joining NAFTA, under the pressure some U.S. PMA [Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturers Association] laboratories are exerting, ignoring 
the agreement the two governments have signed. 
  The pharmaceutical laboratories with Argentine capital have 
repeatedly and unsuccessfully tried to meet in your country with 
the pharmaceutical industry (PMA) and the U.S. trade 
representative to help find a reasonable solution to this 
problem, but we never got any answer. 
  Despite the fact that the GATT agreement does not fully 
reflect our interests and position, we accept it and respect it. 
We ask you to request a similar attitude from your 
pharmaceutical industry, which is represented by the PMA, 
respecting the decision made by the international community.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Mar (NA) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina will visit Argentina in April to negotiate with 
the administration of President Carlos Menem a debt contracted 
by Cuba during the seventies, during Juan Domingo Peron's 
presidency. 
  Argentine diplomats have always believed that the debt, 
contracted through the export of trucks and other vehicles to 
Cuba during Peron's last term, was "irrecoverable." 
  Cuba had offered to Argentina to pay the debt through 
tourist 
leasings in the island, as it lacks the cash to pay it. 
  Robaina's visit would take place at the completion of the 
negotiations undertaken by Cuban diplomats at the Argentine 
Foreign Ministry to renegotiate the debt.

<F P=106> [Article by Luis Garasino] </F>
  [Text] Lieutenant General Mario Candido Diaz, chief of the 
Joint Staff, on 15 March made known to Vice Foreign Minister 
Fernando Petrella the displeasure that has surfaced because no 
active military man is a member of the Argentine delegation to 
the OAS meeting that is evaluating the possibility of a new 
inter- American security system. 
  Diaz was the person charged with making known the unrest of 
the military leadership regarding a precept that reduces the 
officers to mere observers at the meeting, which is currently 
being held in Buenos Aires and will conclude on 18 March. 
  Questions of form must also be added to this unrest, as the 
Armed Forces Staff received a photocopied paper informing it of 
the opening and conclusion of the meeting, and this was 
considered "more of a notification than an invitation." 
  The military observers (or "listeners," as some 
sarcastically 
termed them) were thus in this role able to follow the 
discussions regarding a main point: the creation of a new 
continental security system, and the distrust of those countries 
that fear an attempt at "verticalization" under the hegemony of 
the United States. 
  The Mexican delegation stated that progress in the 
implementation of measures of mutual confidence cannot be 
achieved until a "new security concept that responds to the 
threats hovering over the region" has been clearly defined. 
  The comments from the Argentine ambassador to the OAS, 
Hernan 
Patino, somewhat cleared the atmosphere, which to that point had 
been somewhat monotonous, and his specific reference to the 
chicken and the egg seemed to block any further delay in 
discussing the heart of the problem. 
  This problem concerns the concrete measures of a military 
nature that are to be taken by the armed forces of the member 
countries -- measures that go further than the usual exchanges 
of officers and goodwill meetings. 
  For its part Brazil supports to a certain extent the 
Argentine position of achieving progress on this topic, although 
essentially on a bilateral country-to-country basis. Uruguay is 
concerned with the principle of non-intervention, while Peru and 
Venezuela give priority to the non-military problems such as 
underdevelopment and what they call "the crime transnationals." 
  In sum, OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares, who arrived 
in the country on 16 March, will not find a panorama much 
different from what he has observed during his entire tenure, in 
other words, the beginning of a long road that will have to be 
taken step by step.

  [Excerpt] Argentine exports amount to just 6 percent of the 
GDP. These figures were described as "very bad and illogical" 
by Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella during the first meeting of 
the administrative council of the Export Foundation. 
  For his calculations, Di Tella used a basis of $250 billion, 
which implies a yearly income of $7,000 per capita and exports 
totaling some $15 billion. 
  Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo also attending the meeting. 
He corrected Di Tella, saying that the basis should be $300 
billion. 
  Based on these figures presented by the two ministers, Di 
Tella calculated that the goal for Argentine exports for the 
year 2000 should be 10 percent of the GDP, that is, between $25 
billion and $30 billion. 
  Speaking in a colloquial tone, Di Tella told the 30 or so 
businessmen that comprise the Export Foundation that "the 
message being conveyed is that export figures will not be so 
ridiculous in the future." The meeting was held yesterday at 
the Foreign Ministry. 
  Di Tella added: "The government must create conditions for 
businessmen to export." He said: "The interests of businessmen 
are the central issue of President Menem's trips abroad." 
  Cavallo emphasized: "Great importance is attributed to a 
good 
exporting record in the mid- and the long-terms if a country 
wants to maintain high growth rates." He stated: "It is of 
paramount importance to export goods and services." 
  Cavallo said: "A great deal still has to be done" with 
regard 
to promoting exports. 
  During this first meeting of the administrative council, 
Cavallo reiterated his concern over news published abroad about 
an alleged unrealistic exchange rate in Argentina and a drop in 
the real purchasing power. Cavallo, who is the council's vice 
president, believes this report is the result of mistaken 
studies conducted by Argentine consultants. 
  He asked those who conduct economic studies to clarify their 
guidelines or, he warned: "They could create doubts in the minds 
of international investors." He added: "If we transmit a wrong 
image abroad, we will all sink together." [passage omitted]

  [Text] La Paz, 18 Mar (EFE) -- Expressing their position in 
defense of coca, the Bolivian Labor Federation (COB) and the 
Tahuantinsuyo Authentic Indian Front (FIAT) today labeled the 
stopovers U.S. Vice President Al Gore will make in the La Paz 
and Santa Cruz airports as "non grata." 
  Gore, his wife, and official delegation are making their 
first trip to several South American countries. They will make 
a five-hour stopover in Bolivia on 20 March en route to Buenos 
Aires, Argentina. 
  Union leader Toribio Hinojosa said: "Mr. Gore's visit would 
be fine if he came to make a commitment to stop the forced coca 
eradication, but we know he comes to increase pressure for the 
continuation of coca destruction." 
  The FIAT issued a communique in which they say the U.S. 
Government and vice president are "enemies of the sacred coca, 
and he is coming to eradicate it." 
  The greatest advantage will be taken from Gore's five-hour 
stay in Bolivia on his way to Argentina. Official reports state 
that he will be declared guest of honor in La Paz and Santa 
Cruz, even though he will not visit those cities. 
  Local officials are preparing a folk music show of the 
Altiplano and the tropical regions, and will give him presents. 
  During the 45-minute flight from La Paz to Santa Cruz, Gore 
will meet with Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and 
his Bolivian counterpart Victor Hugo Cardenas. 
  Vice President Gore will also meet the Bolivian Government 
economic team in the Santa Cruz Viru-Viru Airport. 
  The Bolivian Government and the U.S. Embassy are working on 
the final details of Gore's arrival in the midst of strict 
security measures at the airports of the two cities. 
  The highway from La Paz to Lake Titicaca will be closed for 
about three hours and security will be strengthened at the two 
airports to guarantee Gore's security. 
  Gore will leave the La Paz El Alto international airport, 
located about 15 km from downtown La Paz, for Achica Abajo -- by 
Lake Titicaca -- which is the town where Bolivian Vice President 
Cardenas was born. He will return to the airport and leave for 
Santa Cruz. 
  The signing of several agreements between the two 
governments 
was also announced and, if time allows, a brief meeting with the 
media at the Santa Cruz airport will be held.

  [Excerpt] On 1 March, the government made an energetic 
defense of the traditional use of coca leaf, and it rejected the 
proposal by the UN International Drug Control Board (JIFE) that 
Bolivia and Peru should declare illegal the cultivation and use 
of coca leaf in all its forms. 
  Through an official document, the Foreign Ministry reminded 
JIFE that Bolivia "acknowledges as legal the traditional use" of 
the coca leaf. Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas stated that 
"Bolivia is a sovereign country," where there is a law that 
differentiates between the legal and illegal use of coca leaf. 
  "I believe that Bolivia demands respect for its laws and 
sovereignty. Coca leaf will continue to exist because a large 
part of the country uses it for medicinal, healing, and cultural 
rituals," Cardenas said. 
  Foreign Minister Antonio Arinibar reported that the case of 
excessive coca leaf production has caused a conflictive 
situation due to the process of the change in governments. 
  "The basis of the government's policy is that of voluntary 
eradication in coordination with a responsive and joint effort 
with the producers," he said. 
  Regarding the eradication of coca and the latest incidents 
in 
Chapare, Felix Santos, executive secretary of the General Trade 
Union Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia, stated that 
this sector wants to live in peace, not under a regime of 
violence. "But the government causes violence by forcefully 
eradicating coca plantations that are the only economic support 
for the workers in Cochabamba's tropical region," he said.

  [Text] Bolivian Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas 
condemned the acts of violence in Chapare on 25 February as a 
result of a clash between coca growers and anti-drug forces and 
declared that he was against the eradication by force of surplus 
coca plantations. 
  "We all lose if the dialogue is interrupted; peaceful 
measures must be sought," said Cardenas in pointing out that the 
eradication of surplus coca plantations should be based on an 
agreement with the producers and their grass-roots 
organizations. Cardenas added: "Forceful eradication means 
violence and we reject it." 
  According to some coca growers' leaders, the clash that 
resulted in several injuries was prompted by a government 
decision to forcefully eradicate surplus coca plantations. The 
government has stated that the plantations eradicated during the 
past few months were located near drug laboratories and the 
eradication is being done according to the law. 
  Government Minister German Quiroga asserted that the clash 
was prompted by the peasants' decision to occupy by force the 
Coca Eradication Directorate (Direco), instigated by drug 
traffickers. 
  Cardenas declined commenting on what happened in Chapare. He 
said he did not have precise information but noted that if 
abuses were perpetrated, Congress will demand an explanation 
from the executive branch. 
  He said that although there are laws that provide for the 
eradication of surplus plantations, it should be carried out by 
mutual agreement. 
  Cardenas warned that the recent clashes will strain even 
more 
the tense relationship between coca growers organizations and 
the organizations in charge of controlling coca production. 
  Law No. 1008 on coca and controlled substances classifies 
Chapare as a transitional region in which the coca plantations 
must be eradicated by common agreement with prior payment of 
$2,000 per hectares to the growers. Moreover, the law requires 
that the government carry out programs for alternative crops to 
avoid any traumatic consequences. 
  However, during the past two years the eradication program 
has not developed according to schedule and the benefits of the 
alternative crops are not visible, which has been very 
frustrating for the peasants, thus causing clashes between 
producers and interdiction forces on several occasions.

  [Text] After the tense atmosphere that prevailed last 
weekend, calm returned to Chapare today after the government's 
decision to release 62 people arrested during the violent clash 
between coca leaf growers and antidrug forces on 25 February. 
This information was disclosed by Cochabamba Mayor German Lema 
Araoz. 
  As he announced the release of the arrested people, Minister 
of Government German Quiroga, who applauded the fact that 
"fortunately no significant casualties" were registered, warned 
that the peasants will not be allowed to cause new disturbances. 
  In addition to Quiroga's warning were those made by Social 
Defense Secretary Mario Soliz, who admitted shortly afterward 
that the peasants who were released are being investigated by 
the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) to determine possible 
links to drug traffickers. 
  Soliz asserted that the plan to eradicate illegal coca 
plantations will continue as scheduled in the Chapare area. 
  The coca growers, in turn, accepted the government's 
invitation to a peaceful dialogue as of 2 March in La Paz, but 
warned that the eradication of coca plantations will not be 
discussed because, first of all, they have to discuss their 
proposals to fight drug trafficking and coca leaf production. 
  Evo Morales, executive secretary of the Special Federation 
of 
Peasant Workers of the Tropics, asserted: "We are not going to 
accept compulsory eradication." Morales warned that in view of 
the "offensive" by antidrug forces, "we have no other 
alternative but to strengthen our self-defense committees, the 
peasant defense patrols, and, in some cases, the security 
committees." 
  The General Trade Union of Bolivian Peasant Workers (CSUTCB) 
also voiced support for the coca growers' demands through leader 
Felix Santos, who pointed out the need to tackle this problem in 
a comprehensive manner because "partial" solutions do not have 
positive results. 
  Bolivian Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas condemned the 
violence in Chapare and said he was against eradication by force 
of surplus coca plantations. 
  Cardenas said: "Forced eradication only means violence, 
which we reject," and suggested that the reduction of surplus 
plantations be carried out based on agreements with the 
producers and their grass-roots organizations.

  [Text] The Coca Reduction Directorate, Direco, will 
continue coca farm reduction plans in the tropical zone despite 
the peasants' mobilization in the region, a reliable Direco 
source reported. The source justified the actions by one of the 
brigades that on 26 February destroyed approximately 2.5 
hectares of coca farms in San Pablo colony. 
  He said there is no reason for either suspending or 
interfering with the development of reduction plans. 
  The forceful eradication of coca farms began on 28 February, 
during carnival celebrations, and less than five hectares of 
illegal coca farms have been destroyed since then. 
  Despite the small area of eradicated coca farms, its 
connotations did have repercussions because of the violent 
procedure and the clashes between coca growers and police who 
protected the eradication brigades. 
  The Direco source said that in all the cases in which coca 
farms were forcefully eradicated, the farms were affected by the 
interdiction work because they had maceration pits, and this 
makes them illegal. 
  Said the source: "In the three cases, we did as established 
by Article 71 of Law No. 1008, that is, the farms were destroyed 
without any compensation. The law authorizes transfer of the 
land to state ownership, but this has not been done yet." 
  The new coca eradication brigades are made up of some 400 
officials, most of them antinarcotics policemen who provide 
security and coverage, while Direco officials contract personnel 
for the destruction of farms. 
  In addition to compulsory eradication, voluntary eradication 
after payment of $2,000 per hectare is still in force. 
  The source added: "Many peasants have registered on the 
Direco lists for eradication of their coca farms, asking for the 
corresponding compensation." 
  He said that during the 26 February incidents, no Direco 
personnel were injured or mistreated, but there was a big shock.

  [Text] La Paz, 20 Mar (EFE) -- Government sources told EFE 
that Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada will reshuffle 
his cabinet in the next few days. 
  A majority of La Paz newspapers said in their front pages on 
20 March that Sanchez de Lozada will reshuffle his cabinet, 
dismissing some of his ministers and changing the assignment of 
others, possibly on 22 March. 
  The sources consulted by EFE said the ministers who will 
almost surely leave the government are Defense Minister Antonio 
Cespedes, Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters, and Interior Minister 
German Quiroga. 
  The same sources said the "super ministers" of economic 
development, Fernando Illanes, and human development, Fernando 
Romero, will have their assignments changed. 
  The sources also said that current Minister of the 
Presidency 
Carlos Sanchez Berzain and an outstanding entrepreneur and 
political leader from Santa Cruz are the leading candidates to 
replace Interior Minister Quiroga if he leaves the cabinet. 
  Sanchez de Lozada's government is formed by a coalition of 
his party, the liberal Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR), 
the populist Civic Solidarity Union (UCS), and the social 
democratic Free Bolivia Movement (MBL). 
  The UCS, the party granting the MNR control of the absolute 
majority in Congress, presently has one of its members as head 
of the Defense Ministry. The post was assigned to Antonio 
Cespedes, but he is expected to leave the government because his 
own party has requested that he be removed. 
  The MBL, whose votes in Congress are not essential, was able 
to get the Foreign Ministry for its leader Antonio Aranibar. His 
continuation is assured because he seems to be Sanchez de 
Lozada's government's most popular minister. 
  Sanchez de Lozada formed his government on 6 August 1993 
after his victory by a relative majority in the 6 June 1993 
election. 
  In these seven months of government, Sanchez de Lozada's 
cabinet has established the legislative basis for a future 
absolute transformation of the Bolivian economy and 
administration. 
  The key instruments in this transformation are the 
Capitalization Law to privatize public companies, and the 
People's Participation Law to give more power to citizens in the 
political and administrative decisionmaking process and the 
allotment of state resources through the country's 
municipalization. 
  Sanchez de Lozada also has reorganized the executive branch 
by significantly reducing, among other things, the number of 
ministries.

  [Text] Monsignor Oscar Paez Garcete, president of the 
Paraguayan Episcopal Conference [CEP], has said: "The Church 
contributed to the campesinos by supporting them in their 
demands, which we believe to be legitimate. We helped them to 
prepare the first groups, the first organizations, through 
ecclesiastic movements and social pastoral activities, which 
helped them to organize, to become aware, and to become capable 
of reasoning in such a way as to identify and defend their 
rights." 
  He denied the report circulating in political circles that 
the Church contributed financially to the campesino march. 
"Neither the CEP nor any diocese did this formally. I do not 
know who disseminated this rumor. Some lay organizations of 
some parishes or the campesino movements themselves may have 
made contributions out of solidarity, which I believe is totally 
normal. In addition, campesinos are sufficiently mature to 
manage on their own," the bishop said. 
  He termed as "interesting" the solidarity that the 
campesinos 
received from other sectors. He added: "To a certain degree, 
some solidarity was expressed by opportunists. After the 
campesinos made the effort to gather in the interior and get to 
Asuncion, they encountered here in the capital some political 
and other groups that offered their solidarity. The power 
groups had the possibility, and even the obligation, to seek 
some kind of solution to this economic and social situation, 
which is not new." 
  He indicated that seeking a solution does not depend only on 
the president. "Congress and the judicial branch are also 
responsible. We need an improved judicial system and more 
guarantees in this sector. The drafting of budgets should also 
be improved. In addition to the lack of appropriate payment for 
products, there also a deficit in providing fundamental 
requirements: Education, roads, schools, health, and 
communications. All of these need resources from the budgets. 
The institutions that deal with budgets say they do not have 
the resources. A responsibility is to be found there." 
  "To support the campesinos also means relying on an 
appropriate legislation to collect resources from the people who 
have more, and other legislation to recover ill-gotten gains and 
put them at the service of the common welfare. This could have 
been done by the power groups, who could have begun this task 
immediately so that the solidarity with the campesinos could 
have been expressed with concrete facts to help them," he 
concluded.

  [Text] Some legislators are reportedly ready to renegotiate 
the plan recently approved in the lower chamber. Some members of 
the delegation that traveled to Washington to draft this plan 
are ready to return to Washington, according to Deputy Antoine 
Joseph. Commenting on the statements of the UN secretary 
general, who expressed the desire to pursue negotiations in 
order to achieve a new plan in conformity with the Governors 
Island agreement, Deputy Joseph revealed that he was ready to 
undertake the political pilgrimage if that effort can help solve 
the crisis. The legislators are reportedly willing to sit down 
with the president-in-exile this time to listen to his 
reservations and viewpoint. Deputy Joseph answers Edner Jean's 
questions: 
  [Begin recording] 
  [Joseph, in Creole] I do not believe that the latest 
statement made by the UN secretary general is ambiguous at all. 
On the contrary, it is one more way to support the plan of the 
parliamentary delegation. When he said that he had opened a 
space for dialogue and negotiation, he also said that he was 
waiting for the Senate to make a decision and, most probably, he 
is expecting the Senate to ratify the plan, meaning that he is 
referring to a document. 
  Certainly, President Aristide has some reservations on the 
plan, and those points, without modifying the plan, are 
essentially guarantees that President Aristide requires. The 
parliamentary delegation, the UN secretary general, the Clinton 
administration, and President Aristide are going to sit down to 
offer President Aristide the guarantees that he needs so that he 
understands the reason for the plan, the applicability of the 
plan, and the reason we say that the plan is efficient, 
realistic, and peaceful. 
  [Jean] Does that mean, Deputy Joseph, that the delegation 
will be willing to go back to Washington to renegotiate the plan 
if President Aristide and the UN secretary general ask them to 
do so? 
  [Joseph, in Creole] I have said many times that I was 
willing 
to take my pilgrim's staff, go to Washington, and meet with all 
concerned sectors -- I started doing so, why not continue -- all 
the more so if there is a plan today and this plan, for us, 
constitutes a good springboard for a solution to the Haitian 
crisis. I must tell you that those who are against the plan, 
until now, have never said what they have against the plan and 
have never defined their reservations toward the plan, which 
would allow us legislators to engage them in a debate to help 
clarify those reservations. 
  We must ask ourselves the question: Today, what is the 
alternative? Not necessarily a presidium, not necessarily the 
reactivation of Article 149, not necessarily Joseph Nerette, not 
necessarily casting aside the 30 September family, but a 
realistic plan which takes into account the position of the 
international community, the position of President Aristide, and 
the position of the Army. 
  [Jean] But the Army is still mute on the plan, while Father 
Aristide's stance is known. Does the Army's silence constitute 
another element of blockade? 
  [Joseph, in Creole] You can interpret this silence in two 
ways. I know that the military have not felt that they can take 
a stand until now. Perhaps they also feel that they do not have 
the guarantees to accept the plan. What I can say to the Army is 
that I think the Army has already committed a major mistake in 
rejecting the Washington protocol. Is the Army going to repeat 
that mistake? I would hope not, because in this plan there is a 
way for the military to reinforce the military institution. [end

  [Excerpts] The Governors Island agreement and the New York 
pact are null and void in the opinion of the 18 January 
parliamentarians who have maintained their decision not to 
refrain from participating in the sessions at the Senate of 
Republic. The unofficial office of the Senate (?wants) the 
parliamentary plan to be sent to them so they can look into it. 
The following is a report by Daly Valet: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] 
  [Valet] Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Stanley Schrager spoke at 
the 
beginning of the week, saying that the parliamentary plan would 
be voted on in the Senate this week. From 14 March through 17 
March, the Senate situation has remained the same. Nothing has 
changed. The days that pass at the Senate look like one 
another: The Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion [ACP] senators 
are meeting in camera; the Senate session room is empty; and 
Firmin Jean-Louis, president of the legitimate office, has been 
absent since the most recent clashes of last week. The problem 
of two offices within the Senate has remained unchanged despite 
negotiations and discussions underway among the ACP senators. 
How can the parliamentary plan come to a vote in this situation 
of confusion? We know the office presided over by Firmin 
Jean-Louis has already received a copy of the resolution passed 
in the Chamber of Deputies. But has Bernard Sansaricq's 
unofficial office been informed of the parliamentary plan? 
  [Senator Osny Eugene] No, Daly, until now, we have not been 
officially informed of the plan passed by the parliamentarians 
in the lower chamber. We have heard about the plan through the 
press. We expect the lower chamber to inform us of this plan so 
we can look into it. 
  [Valet] This answer is the stand of Osny Eugene, quaestor of 
the unofficial office, who will apparently continue to hear 
about the plan in the press because it is the office presided 
over by Firmin Jean-Louis that the Chamber of Deputies has 
acknowledged for work on the issue. Eugene says he does not 
give much importance to the parliamentary plan. According to 
him, a plan signed in Washington does not deserve much 
importance. 
  [Eugene] [passage omitted] We have nothing against the fact 
that a plan was discussed in Washington but, as long as the plan 
has not yet been concluded here in Haiti, it is very difficult 
for us to give it importance. We think there are enough people 
in this country. There are enough institutions to look into the 
presentation of a plan. I see no reason for us to go as far as 
Washington for a plan. 
  [Valet] As an 18 January parliamentarian, the quaestor of 
the 
unofficial office, has sworn hundreds of times that he will not 
allow anybody to ask him to abstain so the parliamentary plan 
can be voted on by the Senate. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Electricity of Haiti [EDH] has decided to cease 
completely the exploitation of the Peligre hydroelectric power 
station because the artificial lake has reached its minimum 
level of 153 meters. During the shutdown, repair and 
maintenance will be carried out at the power station on two of 
the three turbines in order to take the maximum advantage of the 
next rainy season expected during the month of May. 
  According to an EDH announcement, the work should last four 
weeks. EDH will guarantee 100 1.326369e-315xploitability of the production 
capacity of the hydroelectric power station, that is 54 MW, as 
soon as the level of the lake goes back up with the heavy rains 
of May. EDH hopes to reduce rationing soon and to maintain 
reasonable service throughout the grid in the capital. 
  We should also say that mud patches have allegedly reached 
the shores of the lake and have even allegedly reached the 
turbines, according to inhabitants in the area contacted by 
Signal FM.

  [Excerpts] The blackout is spreading in Port-au-Prince. 
Several neighborhoods of the capital have been without 
electricity for a week. Since the Peligre hydroelectric power 
station closed for repairs, electricity has been supplied only 
every two or three days for a few hours to the luckiest 
neighborhoods and every eight days to the rest. The zones on a 
priority circuit have basically disappeared: the ministers' 
quarter, the National Palace area, the Army headquarters, and 
the General Hospital are also affected by the rationing. The 
blackout and the long hours of cut-off could last a long time. 
The deadline for completion of repair to the Peligre 
hydroelectric power station is mid-May. 
  Sanatorium Hospital has no electricity. The sanatorium, 
which 
treats tuberculosis patients of the metropolitan area, can no 
longer function. The institution is facing quite a critical 
situation. Guilloto Francois filed a report: 
  [Begin Francois recording, in Creole] Even if it is still 
standing, the muscles of the sanatorium have begun to atrophy. 
That statement was made by one of the hospital staff, sending a 
distress signal that the hospital is in a critical state. 
  Some doctors and patients are using the hospital, under some 
conditions. Work materials and medicines have grown scarce. In 
addition, the sanatorium is facing an energy crisis. Doctors and 
patients are in a blackout. Doctors asserted that they can no 
longer use electrical appliances. Sanitary conditions have 
gotten worse because of the lack of water for days now. The 
sanatorium formerly received electricity on Wednesdays and 
Fridays. However, for the past few days, the sanatorium has 
received neither electricity nor water. 
  The crisis has paralyzed several sections, including 
endoscopy which takes care of urgent cases. Several patients of 
the sanatorium had to be evacuated because of the crisis which 
prevails. At 1930 GMT on 17 March, a pregnant woman arrived at 
the sanatorium. Despite her pains, the doctors were powerless 
because of the energy crisis. [passage omitted] 
  The doctor on duty at the hospital did not give details on 
the situation. Questioned on the poor operation of the hospital, 
the doctor refused to comment; he said the hospital's crisis is 
the same as the country's. 
  One of the young doctors who agreed to give details stated 
that the hospital had no support structures to help it run 
normally. [passage omitted] 
  The patients in the sanatorium do not eat regularly because 
of lack of water in the hospital and at night, everyone is in a 
total blackout. A source in the sanatorium stated that the 
Public Health Ministry is aware of the problem and has promised 
to help. 
  While awaiting relief for their patients, the doctors and 
staff of the institution, just as others, continue to function 
at the same level as the country does. [end recording]

  [Text] Port-au-Prince Mayor-elect Evans Paul has rejected 
the proposal of Assistant-Mayor Joseph Gerald Salomon who said 
on 17 March that he was ready to meet with the Port-au-Prince 
mayor in the presence of the press. I have nothing to say to 
somebody who is not credible -- Salomon must respect the chain 
of command, Evans Paul stated. 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] 
  [Paul] I am not in an election campaign with Salomon. I have 
no show to put on with Salomon. I am taking an administrative 
step. It is within the scope of the administrative step that I 
was trying to see if he could understand that he had a 
responsibility. But I will not engage in demagoguery with 
somebody with no credibility like Salomon. What would I discuss 
with somebody who does not believe in democracy, who does not 
believe in principles, who maintains an anarchical stance, and 
who rejects the work of an institution? What would I say to 
somebody who is setting obstacles despite all my efforts? What 
would I say? I have already said all that I have to say. I 
said it in the letter I wrote. Salomon has said that he does 
not want dialogue, that he does not want compromise. If he does 
not want dialogue and compromise, what would be the reason for a 
meeting in front of the press? (?Because) if you cannot submit 
yourself to the discipline of the administration, what would I 
have to tell you? I have no time to waste. I have much work to 
do. I can compromise. I can make concessions. I can hold a 
dialogue, but first of all there must hope that the dialogue 
will produce results. 
  [Valet] Furthermore, Paul has required guarantees before 
sending money to the Port-au-Prince City Hall, fearing that this 
money would be misused, as was the case this past December, he 
says. 
  [Paul] We explained thoroughly that Salomon has created any 
and all impossible situations so as to allow us to carry out the 
payroll properly. [sentence as heard] Normally, we have a 
responsibility toward city hall funds. We cannot allow 
ourselves to send money to a city hall where a lot of people 
arbitrarily do whatever they want with this money, as happened 
with the payroll we made in December when a lot of people -- not 
the least, I can cite the name of Assistant-Mayor Jocelyne 
Sablon -- did not receive their salaries. 
  We have state employees who are ready to issue the payroll. 
But we must be able to make sure that the persons to whom we 
give the checks are really those entitled to them. Then they 
will give us a signed receipt. [end recording]

  [Text] Other residents in Cite Soleil are calling for an 
urgent solution to the crisis. About ten of them denounce, in a 
statement to Radio Metropole, the disastrous effects of the 
international sanctions imposed on Haiti. Enough is enough said 
the residents of Cite Soleil who are calling on the concerned 
authorities to assume their responsibilities. The residents 
assert that they are willing to accept any solution to the 
crisis as long as it allows the lifting of the embargo and the 
end of the nightmare for the Haitian people. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording in Creole] Even if the 
Army takes power we do not mind. We want the embargo to be 
lifted, the population to find food to eat, gasoline prices to 
drop, and the security problems to be solved so that everyone 
can normally go about his activities. Whether it is the 
parliament or the Army which takes over, as long as we can eat 
and drink, we do not mind. We heard on the radio that [Front for 
Haitian Advancement and Progress Leader] Mr. Constant asserted 
that he would find a solution to the crisis. 
  We are calling on those people to find a solution. It is 
time that they save the country because Aristide is out of the 
question. We are not concerned with Aristide since he did not 
return on 30 September. It is a scenario being played. It is a 
movie, a play but they [not further identified] want to use the 
population as a cover. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Daily political violence prevails in Cite 
Soleil. Daily political violence in Port-au-Prince reportedly 
has its epicentre in the slum neighborhoods, particularly Cite 
Soleil where the residents wake up almost every day and discover 
dead bodies of people shot or stabbed. The murders are 
perpetrated at night by unidentified armed men, and the victims 
are reportedly political militants according to some testimonies 
gathered on the spot by Radio Metropole. On 17 March, the dead 
bodies of three people were found in the streets of the 
afflicted city, corpses attacked by dogs and pigs. Jean-Max 
Blanc filed a report: 
  [Begin Blanc recording in Creole] The people of Cite Soleil, 
one of the worst slums in Port-au-Prince discovered on 17 March 
the corpses of three people in a vacant lot. No resident in the 
Cite was able to give information on the author of the act, nor 
did any group claim responsibility. Pigs started eating the 
faces of two of them. Those corpses include a former sergeant of 
the Haitian Armed Forces; the two others are hardly 
recognizable. [passage omitted] 
  It is not the first time that pigs are eating people 
murdered in Cite Soleil. A few weeks ago, the residents in the 
Cite reported three similar cases. Long before some 
unidentified men committed those acts, the UN/OAS international 
civilian mission denounced the growing acts of violence in 
Port-au-Prince. In a press release issued on 16 March, the 
mission reported 50 cases of murder from January to February 
that the Haitians pointed out to the mission. The victims 
included 12 who were members of grassroots organizations and 
another one was an officer of the Haitian Armed Forces who was 
killed in Carrefour Feuilles on 20 February. The observers 
asserted that they noticed several corpses with torn faces and 
other amputated organs. [passage omitted]. 
  The people that the residents in Cite Soleil discovered were 
abandoned not too far from the area were a fire destroyed more 
than 200 small houses three months ago. At that time, the 
residents in Cite Soleil charged that the members of FRAPH 
[Revolutionary Front for Haitian Advancement and Progress], the 
neo-Duvalierist party, were responsible for the act. [end

  [Text] Mexico City, 15 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- The European Union 
(EU) today reported that NAFTA will allow Mexico to move toward 
economic development that is closer to that of its associates 
and will increase its ties with the EU. 
  In the document "The European Union and NAFTA," the EU 
indicates that NAFTA -- which was implemented in January -- 
"will have effects on its member nations, on the EU, and other 
nations on political, trade, and investment levels." 
  In the document disclosed to NOTIMEX, the European 
organization indicates that to the extent that the Treaty moves 
Mexico closer to the "North American orbit," its relations with 
the EU could be significantly increased. Although the EU is 
Mexico's second ranking trading partner -- after the United 
States -- this nation only represents for the EU 1.4 percent of 
its total exports. 
  After the rules of the trilateral agreement are implemented 
and as the tariffs disappear between Mexico, the United States, 
and Canada, European products are expected to experience a 
certain displacement by U.S. products in the Mexican market, the 
EU said. Nevertheless, it ruled out the possibility that the 
activity generated and reinforced in Mexico by the trade treaty 
will allow greater trade expansion with the European bloc. 
  According to a study carried out by the EU on the effects of 
the trade treaty and on EU-Mexico investment, there are 
possibilities that displacement of Mexican imports from the EU 
will not be adversely affected. Nevertheless, if these are 
affected, the main effect will be on the goods that face greater 
tariff differences with regard to U.S. and Canadian products. 
  The document indicates that this effect can be diminished by 
the process of gradual removal of tariffs foreseen in the treaty 
and by the fact that the EU is the sole supplier of a large 
number of goods on a worldwide scale; therefore it does not face 
competition from North America.

  [Text] Lima, 18 Mar (EFE) -- The Peruvian Government has 
extended the state of emergency in Lima and its port of El 
Callao for another 60 days because "continued terrorist actions 
force this measure." 
  Lima and El Callao houses more than one third of Peru's 
total 
population of 22 million inhabitants. 
  The measure suspends personal guarantees contained in the 
Constitution and delegates political and military control to the 
Armed Forces. 
  The measure was published today in the official newspaper EL 
PERUANO. The newspaper also publishes another measure that 
extends the state of emergency for 60 days in the provinces of 
Yungay, Carhuaz, and Recuay in the northern Andes department of 
Ancash. 
  On 16 March, the Defense Ministry extended for 60 days the 
state of emergency in four jungle provinces in the northern part 
of the country.

  [Text] Lima, 20 Mar (AFP-NA) -- The police reported today 
that at least one soldier was killed and three civilians injured 
in a clash that occurred on 19 March in the town of Puente 
Duran, Huanuco, 400 km east of Lima. 
  Through a decree published today the government has extended 
the state of emergency for another 60 days, as of today, in 
Cusco, a department located 1,300 km southeast of Lima, in order 
to continue conducting antisubversive operations in the region. 
  Through this measure, which encompasses the provinces of 
Paruro, Acomayo, Chumbivilcas, Canas, and Canchis, 
constitutional rights are suspended and the Armed Forces will 
continue to be in charge of public order. 
  According to the source, Army Sergeant Ricardo Sanchez, 19, 
was killed in the clash in Puente Duran. They added that three 
civilians were seriously injured when the military patrol 
clashed with about 100 insurgents who broke into the town to get 
food supplies. 
  The military command in the area is conducting a dragnet 
operation in the area to capture the insurgents who escaped into 
the jungle.

  [Text] The Peruvian National Police [PNP] have unexpectedly 
ordered the dismantling of the Criminal Investigative Police and 
the Fiscal Patrimony Division in the interior. Personnel of the 
Counterterrorism Provincial Police (Jecote) have been 
significantly reduced, thus affecting the technical side of 
investigative work. 
  The personnel from these units, which formed a division and 
were headed by colonels (in regions) and commanders (in 
subregions), will now occupy administrative posts. 
  This absurd measure by the PNP has cut personnel and reduced 
the duties of the National Counterterrorism Directorate 
(Dincote), the National Criminal Investigative Directorate 
[Direccion Nacional de Investigacion Criminal -- Dinincri], and 
the Fiscal Patrimony National Directorate. 
  On 4 March, the PNP issued Internal Resolution 
2848-DGPNP/EMP, approving the PNP organization for this year. 
This entails substantial changes in the structure of the PNP, 
which was established by Legislative Decree No. 744 issued in 
1991. 
  Sources have criticized the changes, stating that a 
resolution issued by the PNP director cannot modify a resolution 
issued by a higher institution. The biggest concern is that the 
changes have taken place in the provinces. 
  EL COMERCIO correspondents have reported that, for example, 
the Criminal Investigative Police and the Fiscal Patrimony 
Directorate have already been dismantled and the specialized 
investigative tasks that they carried out have been assigned to 
the local police stations which are short of personnel who, in 
turn, are not properly trained to do this job. 
  The source said that this measure represents a ``green 
light'' for delinquency in the interior because personnel at 
police stations are scarce and their logistic and investigative 
capabilities are well below that of criminals in the provinces. 
  Reduction of Jecote personnel and duties was also criticized 
because, although terrorist actions have decreased, one can 
hardly ``sing victory'' or afford to deploy personnel onto other 
duties. 
  Proof of this is that the Armed Forces continue in a "state 
of emergency" in many zones that have apparently been pacified. 
The military authorities, in a more responsible attitude, 
believe there is still work to be done in these areas. 
  The aforementioned resolution prompted the removal of 200 
Dincote detectives specialized in counterterrorism, who will be 
placed at the disposal of the Public Order Directorate 
[Direccion de Orden Publico]. This means they will wear 
uniforms and be assigned to patrol the streets. 
  Dinincri functions have also been reduced. For example, the 
Kidnap Investigation Division (Didcol) -- which handled cases of 
adult rape, seduction and rape of minors, procuring, and 
indecent assault -- has been dismantled. 
  The departments and operation groups of five other Dinincri 
divisions have also been reduced. Three departments of the 
Division for Crimes Against Life, Body, and Health [Division de 
Delitos Contra la Vida, el Cuerpo, y la Salud] have been 
dismantled and only the Homicide Department is left. The same 
goes for the Theft Division. 
  The Contraband, Customs Tariff Evasion Division, and other 
divisions of the Fiscal Patrimony Directorate have been reduced. 
  As with Dincote, personnel that leave the units will be 
placed at the disposal of the Public Order Directorate or will 
be given administrative jobs.

<F P=106> [Article by Mirko Lauer: "Privately Owned Dollars, Public </F>
Poverty"] 
  [Text] The image of Alberto Fujimori with money is a 
nightmare for some sectors of the opposition. IU [United Left] 
leader Cesar Barrera and APRA [American Popular Revolutionary 
Alliance] leader Abel Salinas have said the thought of Fujimori 
with privatization money has prompted the opposition to redesign 
its electoral strategy. 
  While the details of this redefinition are not clear, we 
must 
recall that the opposition strategy was based on an insolvent 
Fujimori, abandoned by voters who are fed up with the bruises of 
five years of structural adjustment. But even Barrera and 
Salinas seem convinced that the situation of Peruvians can be 
improved with the $1.4 billion from the phone company 
privatization. 
  They are right in that large sums of money always awaken 
hope 
and make imaginations fly. Even Barrera and Salinas are 
beginning to feel it, in their own way. Many believe -- if only 
subconsciously -- Fujimori was unable to improve the economic 
situation merely because he did not have the resources with 
which to do it. 
  From the very beginning, however, Fujimori did have the 
funds 
for improving the people's situation, but he did not do 
anything. He preferred to repay the foreign debt at an 
unnecessarily high rate, which caused the productive sector to 
stagger. High interest rates, a low dollar rate, an open 
market, and low income are the trademarks of his economic 
program, which is still in foce. 
  It is true that the main issue is now the April 94-April 95 
electoral year. Specialists know that channeling money to the 
poor in this type of system is very difficult, if not 
impossible. Governments that achieved this objective had to have 
a radically changed identity. 
  The announcement to construct 50,000 houses clearly depicts 
this situation. These houses are not for the homeless but for 
those who earn enough to contract a mortgage at market prices, 
or who want to move from a rented house to their own house. 
Many of these people, who have a monthly income of $300, could 
be longstanding Fujimori supporters. 
  But the construction of these houses may all the same help 
to 
reactivate the economy. What is not totally clear is whether a 
reactivated economy can help the increasing number of people who 
are choosing to vote for the opposition. Among other reasons, 
they are doing this because the new part of the economy is 
progressively becoming an enclave to strengthen internal 
inequalities instead of soothing them. 
  Rather than changing its strategy, the opposition must 
develop a strategy. We are sure Fujimori will not do anything 
to improve the situation of a vast majority because that would 
go against his very raison d'etre in the government. Fujimori 
will try to make his spending look as if it is for the benefit 
of the majority. 
  The best antidote against this might be to read the figures, 
rather than the headlines, and look at the daily lifestyle of 
the majority.

<F P=106> [From the "Without Confirmation" column by Alfonso Baella] </F>
  [Text] The new Constitution provides for a new electoral 
system that comprises the National Elections Board, the National 
Electoral Processes Office [Oficina Nacional de Procesos 
Electorales], and the Identity and Civil Status National 
Registry [Registro Nacional de Identificacion y Estado Civil]. 
  Supposedly, the Constitution must be respected. Therefore, 
this system should already have been implemented -- as 
established by the Constitution itself -- and planning, 
organization, and execution of the electoral processes, 
referendum, or other type of consultations begun, as well as the 
maintenance and custody of a single registry of the peoples' 
identity and a registry of acts that modify people's civil 
status. 
  It all looks great in theory but in practice we find that we 
are in the wake of an electoral process -- nothing less than 
presidential and congressional elections -- and there is not 
enough time left to implement this entire mechanism. 
  What can be done about it? 
  Fulfill the terms of the Constitution word for word as some 
maintain, although this may entail that in the end -- now that 
election day is almost here -- one component or another of the 
electoral system will not function? 
  Or should we, as others propose, amend the new Constitution 
not more than three months after it was promulgated to 
temporarily suspend the enforcement of the new electoral system 
and thus let the National Electoral Board be in charge of the 
next elections? 
  This, too, entails many risks. 
  What would happen if the Constitution Committee were to 
approve the proposed constitutional amendment but the plenum 
were to reject it. If there is little time left now, as of 
April -- which is when the issue will be debated -- there will 
be even less time. 
  But supposing the plenum approves it, this constitutional 
reform would have to be submitted to a referendum -- under what 
system? -- if it is not sanctioned in two successive ordinary 
sessions with a favorable vote, in each case, more than 
two-thirds of the legal number of congressmen. 
  Neither alternative seems the most convenient or feasible. 
  The thing then would be to find a solution within the 
Constitution. 
  This solution is in a very brief final and transitory 
article, the 11th, that states: "Constitutional provisions that 
demand new and greater public expenditures will be applied 
progressively." 
  Won't the establishment of the Electoral Process National 
Office and the Identification and Civil Status Office demand 
"new and greater public expenditures?" 
  If the answer is yes, then there will be no other choice 
than 
-- as the Constitution itself says -- to interpret (one of the 
power's Congress has) the law in order to establish that these 
two components of the new electoral system be "progressively" 
established after the 1995 elections. 
  In the meantime, the National Electoral Board would be 
responsible for the development of the presidential and 
parliamentarian elections. 
  Another final and transitory article, the 10th, states: "The 
law establishes how the offices, officials, and servants of the 
Civil Status Registry of local government and of the Electoral 
Registry will be incorporated into the Identity and Civil Status 
National Registry." 
  Well, all we need is a law stating that this step should 
take 
place after the next elections. 
  These are two other subjects that legislators and 
Constituent 
Assembly members can discuss.

  [Text] Lima, 17 Mar (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori reported that one and one-half months ago he rejected a 
letter of intent presented by the IMF "because it altered some 
of the objectives the government already had planned." 
  According to Fujimori, the letter of intent to be signed 
with 
the IMF must contemplate the special emphasis the government 
will give to investment in the social area. 
  He said: "Investment in the social area refers not only to 
investment in the fields of health and education, but also to 
improving the country's infrastructure, for example, by building 
highways." 
  For this reason, we must hold discussions with the IMF, he 
said. He added: "I am sure the IMF will understand the 
government objectives because we have pointed them out very 
clearly." 
  He said the first step was to implement an economic 
stabilization program, and the second step was to establish 
peace in the country. To implement these programs, however, "we 
also must seek social stabilization," as already has been 
explained to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus. 
  Fujimori said the social program is supported by the IMF, 
cooperating countries, and international financial 
organizations. This is why we want these issues to be included 
in the letter of intent, he added. 
  The Peruvian president made these comments on 16 March while 
visiting 1,400 members of the Ashaninka jungle tribe recently 
rescued from the Shining Path terrorist group at Satipo, in 
Peru's central jungle. 
  Economy Minister Jorge Camet pointed out that the government 
plans to invest $450 million in the 1994 social support program. 
He added that the IMF fears this large amount of money may force 
the dollar rate down and reactivate inflation. 
  A three-member IMF delegation arrived in Lima on 17 March to 
meet Fujimori and Camet. 
  Spanish Jose Luis Ruiz, a member of the delegation who will 
stay in Peru for 15 days, said the delegation will analyze the 
structure of the expenditures to be made by the government in 
social programs.

<F P=106> [Report by Ana Fernanda Valderrama from the Gonzalo Jimenez </F>
de Quezada Convention Center, site of the Liberal Party 
convention, in Santa Fe de Bogota; from the "National Newscast" 
-- live relay] 
  [Text] After being proclaimed the Liberal Party's [PL] 
presidential candidate and sole leader, Ernesto Samper Pizano is 
ready to officially announce at any moment Humberto de la Calle 
Lombana as the PL's vice presidential candidate. 
  Humberto de la Calle Lombana has repeatedly denied he will 
accept this nomination. Nevertheless, within the past few 
hours, following extensive consultations within the PL, he has 
accepted the nomination. A few minutes before entering this 
hall at the Gonzalo Jimenez de Quezada Convention Center, where 
the PL convention is being held, Humberto de la Calle Lombana 
said he decided to accept the nomination for the sake of the 
fatherland and not as a personal challenge. We have prepared a 
report on why Humberto de la Calle's acceptance of the 
nomination is a key victory for Ernesto Samper Pizano. 
  [Begin unidentified reporter recording] Humberto de la Calle 
holds the key for Samper to become the president of the 
Republic. He is at the top of the polls, and he finished second 
in the primary. There is no significant opposition to him 
within the party, which should guarantee at least 80 percent of 
the party's support for a Samper-De La Calle ticket. He comes 
from the provinces, which means he can garner regional votes, 
and he is associated with the Gaviria government and is 
considered to have the utmost integrity. In vain, De la Calle 
had struggled to coerce Samper to face him in a public debate, 
and he had vowed he would never become a vice presidential 
candidate. He is a neoliberal, and, in sharp contrast to 
Samper's status quo views, he personifies a political 
renaissance. 
  De la Calle is well-know throughout the country thanks to a 
Conservative, Belisario Betancur, who appointed him registrar 
during his administration. His other great promoter was Cesar 
Gaviria, who appointed him government minister to serve as his 
right-hand man in political matters. As minister, he presided 
over the National Constituent Assembly, and ironically, as the 
presidential designate he led the battle for the creation of the 
vice presidency. His work in the assembly groomed him as a PL 
presidential hopeful. [end recording] 
  Humberto de la Calle has just been officially named the vice 
presidential candidate on Samper Pizano's presidential ticket, 
and the news is being well received. The convention also has 
just proclaimed Ernesto Samper as the party's official 
presidential candidate and sole leader of the PL. Samper Pizano 
is already presenting his platform. 
  Right now, Ernesto Samper is presenting his economic 
proposals. His main issue will be employment. He also says, if 
he is elected president, he will appoint a peace commissioner at 
the ministerial level. This would mean the elimination of the 
Office of the Peace Adviser, as well as the elimination of the 
Government Ministry, which would then be called the Ministry of 
the Interior and would be placed in charge of developing a 
policy to decentralize the state. 
  Samper Pizano also has voiced full support for the pastoral 
work of the bishops of Colombia, who have been seriously 
questioned in recent days. He also said he will promote women 
into various government posts. 
  Ernesto Samper Pizano has just announced a very radical 
proposal in his peace policy. He says he will wage an all-out 
fight against the guerrillas without any negotiations 
whatsoever. Likewise, he has announced he is favor of Colombia 
ratifying the Second Geneva Protocol, which would include the 
guerrillas in reports that pertain to human rights violations.

  [Excerpts] Humberto de la Calle Lombana was named today at 
the Liberal Party [PL] convention as the vice presidential 
candidate, but many surprised viewers wonder today why several 
days ago he vehemently said 1,001 times that he would not accept 
the vice presidency because he considered it to be a consolation 
prize. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [De la Calle Lombana] Many friends told me 
that there was a possibility I would not qualify for office in 
1998 and that therefore I should fight that possibility by all 
means. In the end I reached the conclusion that Colombia and 
the PL are above everything. [applause] [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you think that your decision now 
will take credibility away from you, and if that is the case, 
how can you recover it? 
  [De la Calle] I do not think so, because I was sincere when 
I 
said I was not aspiring to the vice presidency. That was what I 
felt at that time. At this time, I now feel that it is 
necessary to set aside personal interests and take action for 
the benefit of Colombia and the PL. This is not the time for 
being selfish or having personal ambitions. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, Rodrigo Lloreda 
Caicedo, or Francico Posada de la Penada were not chosen. Luis 
Fernando Ramirez, the current labor minister, was the secret ace 
Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana held 
up his sleeve as his candidate for the vice presidency. 
Pastrana, who said he did not feel pressured by the Liberal 
Party's Samper-de la Calle ticket, said Ramirez' appointment did 
not show sectarianism but was a true key to the furtherance of 
social and labor programs. 
  [Begin recording] [Pastrana] I have no doubt whatsoever 
about 
such a noble and loyal traveling companion. We perceive even 
more clearly our future victory. [end recording] 
  Luis Fernando Ramirez Acuna, who was born in Santander and 
is 
35 years old, was selected as the star minister in the Gaviria 
cabinet last year. He stood out for his struggle to get 
Congress to approve the Social Security Law. He has been the 
tax revenue director twice, and he soberly accepted the vice 
presidential postulation today. 
  [Begin recording] [Ramirez] I am honored to be the running 
mate of Andres Pastrana, the man Colombians are awaiting to 
manage the country's future. I hope with your and all 
Colombians' cooperation this country will continue on the path 
to growth, progress, and optimism, the path offered by our 
ticket. Today, I have the great honor of accepting to accompany 
Andres Pastrana, and I do so with great pride. Thank you. [end

  [Text] While 13 officials of the Rio de Oro Municipal 
Registry Office (in Cesar Department) whom the ELN [Army of 
National Liberation] kidnapped were released yesterday in a 
rural area of that town, rebels of the same group destroyed the 
tally sheets of several districts in Achi (Bolivar Department). 
  According to the Cesar police, Edilberto Duran Osorio, Edna 
Barbosa, Sandra Quintero, Hernando Rueda, Teresa Caselles 
Casadiego, Nancy del Rosario Herrera, Ramon Elias Chichilla, 
Yesid Augusto Rincon, Maria Carrascal, Jose del Carmen Porras, 
Obdulio Herrera, Freddy Antonio Leon, and Nixa Salome Sanchez 
were released yesterday morning. 
  The officials had gone to coordinate the district elections 
in La Palestina, Puerto Nuevo, and El Hobo, Rio de Oro 
Municipality. In addition, reports by the police and the 
Departmental Office indicated that close to 3,400 citizens who 
had registered to vote in the rural areas of Rio de Oro, 
Aguachica, and San Diego were unable to due to pressure from the 
guerrillas. 
  The Bolivar police stated yesterday morning that the ELN 
burned the tally sheets (approximately 1,000 ballots) in the 
Tache, San Jacinto de Achi, Bermudas, and Mejico District, Achi 
Municipality. The attack came when the voting officers of four 
villages were traveling on the Magdalena River to bring the 
ballot boxes to the municipality's capital city. The 
delinquents intercepted them and destroyed the ballot boxes, 
voting lists, and other documents. 
  Colonel Hector Castro Cabrera, Bolivar police commander, 
said 
nobody voted in Pinones District (with a potential of 160 
voters), Mompox Jurisdiction, and denied reports that San Pablo 
Mayor Manuel Rudas Ruedas had been kidnapped. 
  The murder of voting officer Luis Arnulfo Campana Lloreda 
and 
the theft of two ballot boxes in Agua Sal District, Bagado 
Jurisdiction, shattered the calm surrounding the vote-counting 
process taking place in El Choco Department. The incidents 
occurred at about 1000 in the morning when the four members of a 
commission were walking toward Bagado carrying the ballot boxes 
containing 373 votes. According to an official report by the 
Choco police, an ELN group took the commission members by 
surprise and later killed Campana.

  [Text] Faced with criticism triggered by the Cali Cartel

communique. The communique from the prosecutor general contains 
seven specific points: 
  1. His activities have been directed at the fight against 
all 
manifestations of crime. The destruction of the Medellin Cartel 
was due to constant work by the Prosecutor General's Office. 
  3. [Number as heard] All the work of the Prosecutor 
General's 
Office has been carried out within the framework of the penal 
code and the law recently reformed by Congress with full 
knowledge of the government. 
  4. The specific objective of the criticism regarding the 
spiritless contribution of consumer countries to the fight 
against drug-trafficking is to fight that illegal activity. 
  The final point of the communique notes the legalization of 
some drugs could become a deadly weapon capable of depriving 
drug traffickers of profits. The prosecutor general concluded 
the communique by stating he would rather die than live in a 
country where criminals can decide who will be the country's 
government officials and judges.

<F P=106> [From the "TV Today" newscast; passages within quotation </F>
marks recorded] 
  [Text] In an exclusive interview with the "TV Today" 
newscast, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff has affirmed his 
determination to punish drug traffickers. He stressed the need 
for U.S. cooperation in this task with whatever evidence it may 
have, and he denounced a discredit campaign which seems to be 
underway. 
  [De Greiff] "I think this is a mistake, because if they 
really want us to put criminals in jail, they must help us with 
evidence; it would be absurd not to do so. 
  "In addition, they cannot expect us to throw people in jail 
without evidence. What we need is evidence, and that is the 
whole purpose of international cooperation." 
  Regarding the Cali Cartel drug traffickers, the prosecutor 
general added the Prosecutor General's Office has some evidence 
against them. 
  [De Greiff] "We have some evidence against them, but the 
more 
evidence we have the better." 
  De Greiff said the Prosecutor General's Office has the 
desire 
and determination to punish drug traffickers firmly. 
  [De Greiff] "What happens is that naturally, when the 
government demands and states drug traffickers be severely 
punished, it is implying there is someone who does not want to 
punish them, who might be me. This perception is absolutely 
wrong." 
  De Greiff added there is a campaign under way to discredit 
him. 
  [De Greiff] "I think this campaign is being handled 
erroneously. It is a very disloyal campaign that I think is 
affecting Colombia's image." 
  Despite everything, the prosecutor general affirmed his 
determination to fight crime. 
  [De Greiff] "My aim is to fight drug trafficking in all 
forms 
and to open the door to those who want to surrender to justice 
within the legal framework promulgated by the government." 
  Finally, de Greiff said he is expecting to receive an 
official communication from the U.S. State Department on 
judicial aid to Colombia.

<F P=106> [From the "NTC News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A few minutes ago, Attorney General Gustavo Arrieta 
said it is not true that the United States has stopped sending 
evidence in conjunction with the Medellin Cartel surrender 
process in Colombia. International wire services have, over the 
past few hours, reported that the U.S. State Department will no 
longer cooperate with Colombian justice. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Attorney 
General, what is the official information or reaction to reports 
by international wire services that U.S. legal assistance to 
Colombia has been suspended? 
  [Arrieta] Diego, the information I have from Colombian 
authorities is that this is not true. 
  [Reporter] Where could this information have originated 
then? 
  [Arrieta] I do not know. I think there are too many 
misunderstandings on this topic, too many unverified reports 
circulating. The truth is that the news could have come from any 
of these confusing reports. I reiterate, however, that according 
to the information I have, this is not true. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Prosecutor, what is the situation right now 
regarding U.S.-Colombian relations in conjunction with 
exchanging legal information relating to drug trafficking? 
  [Arrieta] These past few weeks we have talked with the U.S. 
State Department through the U.S. Embassy and with the support 
of the Colombian Government. The idea is to bolster this process 
because we believe that it continues to be fundamental for 
carrying out surrender policies and legal actions in Colombia. I 
do not think there is any sense in denying that relations have 
been tense and difficult, but we are working on this and I hope 
it turns out well and we will be able to rebuild the judicial 
cooperation program. 
  [Reporter] Does cooperation continue despite current 
problems? 
  [Arrieta] Yes, we have received cooperation these past few 
days. Obviously, the intensity and level has dropped 
significantly, but I repeat, I believe it will recover. [end

<F P=106> [Article by Minister of Finance Rudolf Hommes: "The Economy </F>
Will Be Reorganized"] 
  [Text] The results achieved in terms of inflation and 
growth in 1993 and the favorable economic prospects for 1994, 
backed by a consistent macroeconomic program, have placed the 
Colombian economy on a path of rapid, stable growth. This in 
turn makes it possible to consolidate the program of structural 
reforms carried out by this government, reforms that are 
propelling the country into international markets. 
  The main macroeconomic objectives set by government 
officials 
are to reduce inflation to 19 percent, keep to the course of 
high economic growth of about 5 percent, limit the accumulation 
of reserves to $450 million, and maintain a balanced foreign 
exchange rate. 
  Authorities are employing two types of measures to achieve 
these objectives: moderate adjustments in the minimum wage, 
official wages, and prices for goods and public services based 
on the goal of inflation set, and a mixture of macroeconomic 
policies put together by the Bank of the Republic and the 
government in order to achieve the goals mentioned, based on 
consistent monetary, fiscal, and exchange objectives. 
  Both types of measures must be adopted. If the basic factors 
of inflation are not controlled, inflation will persist even if 
increases in wages and prices on goods and public services are 
held down. Inversely, if only traditional macroeconomic 
instruments are used, the rate of exchange will tend to be 
revalued as the result of an inertial behavior of wages and 
prices on nonadjustable economic goods. 
<H5>  Prices and Wages </H5>
  In order to control wages and prices for goods and public 
services, the government launched its attack on several fronts. 
In terms of wages, increases took both inflationary goals and an 
anticipated 2-percent increase in the average productivity of 
workers into account. These considerations gave rise to the wage 
goals promoted by the government. 
  In addition, the Ministry of Mines and Energy Regulatory 
Commission set 19 percent as the average increase in energy 
rates. Consistent with them, the Ministry raised the price of 
gasoline 19 percent. The minister of finance simultaneously 
requested and successfully obtained the cooperation of mayors in 
setting increases in public urban transport rates not exceeding 
the inflation goal set. In Bogota and Cali, for example, 
increases averaging 19 percent were authorized. Finally, leases, 
which are tied to the rate of inflation for the previous year, 
cannot increase by over 20.3 percent. 
<H5>  Macro Policies </H5>
  A. Monetary policy: In the monetary area, the Bank of the 
Republic board of directors established M1 growth rates 
consistent with the anticipated rate of inflation and will use 
the instruments it has to stay within them. 
  M1 growth is associated, on the one hand, with a demand for 
money consistent with inflationary goals and growth in the 
product and with moderate, stable interest rates. With respect 
to the money supply, the main sources of expansion are the 
accumulation of reserves, the liquidation of exchange 
certificates issued in the past for the purpose of blocking 
foreign exchange income, and the payment of interest by open 
market operations (OMAS). 
  In order to control the supply of money, it will therefore 
be 
necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of reserves, 
which makes it possible to reduce the need to use open market 
operations. For that purpose, the government will make a basic 
contribution, inasmuch as fiscal measures will limit the 
accumulation of reserves and facilitate the task of controlling 
inflation enormously. The measures mean a spending cut of .7 
percent of the GDP and a decision to use resources from the 
fiscal surplus to prepay the foreign debt and invest abroad. 
  In addition, the recently approved exchange measures will 
also make it easier to control means of payment by allowing 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange within a margin. The size 
of that margin does not allow the government to monetize the 
fiscal surplus or act as a de facto mechanism to control public 
spending. 
  B. Fiscal policy: Within the context of modernizing the 
government and spending priorities set by the provisions of the 
new Political Constitution, this Administration has, during its 
four-year term, maintained balanced public finances, thus 
helping achieve goals in terms of inflation and growth. 
  The government will pass on a very favorable fiscal balance 
in 1994 and a surplus amounting to 2 percent of the GDP. This 
figure results from presuming that revenue from the consolidated 
public sector will increase by 37.4 percent, a projection which, 
in addition to anticipated collections of the principal tax 
resources, incorporates receipts from taxation and collection 
campaigns undertaken by DIAN [National Tax and Customs 
Directorate], a conservative estimate of monies collected from 
the sale of assets (600 billion pesos), and revenue amounting to 
$1.2 billion from the cellular telephone concession. 
  Total expenditures of the consolidated public sector will 
rise some 30.7 percent in 1994, 41.7 percent in the Central 
Government, and 25.2 percent in the decentralized sector. This 
growth is under that of the previous year (33.2 percent) and 
achieved by a .7-percent cut in the GDP approved by CONFIS 
[Fiscal Policy Council] at the end of December 1993 and the 
Council of Ministers in January of this year. 
  At the top of the list of the Central Government's spending 
is investment, up 45 percent over the 1993 figure. Likewise, 
transfers will increase an estimated 42.6 percent as a result of 
the Law on Competencies and Resources (regulating constitutional 
precepts governing the fiscal situation and the participation of 
municipalities in the nation's regular receipts) and the payment 
of back pensions. 
  The 45.3-percent increase in spending for personal services 
reflects this government's priorities in terms of strengthening 
internal security, the effectiveness of the judicial system, and 
the quality of the system of education via wage increases for 
police officers, the military, and judges, and the hiring of 
thousands of temporary teachers. 
  As noted, the public sector's surplus will be earmarked for 
reducing liabilities by prepayment of the foreign debt and 
Treasury investments abroad. 
  C. Exchange policy: The Bank of the Republic's board of 
directors has just modified the exchange system in order to make 
the monetary and exchange markets more transparent. Exchange 
certificates were eliminated, meaning that the exchange rate 
will now be freely determined by the market. Nevertheless, the 
Bank of the Republic will continue to put pressure on the dollar 
exchange rate. 
  Such intervention will take the form of the buying and 
selling of foreign exchange on the market, the establishment of 
a margin with maximum buying and selling rates so that the 
exchange rate will fluctuate, and the divulgence of a very 
short-term indicative exchange rate reflecting the intentions of 
the Bank of the Republic with respect to exchange objectives. It 
is hoped that these measures will cause the the exchange rate to 
fall gradually in keeping with the goal set for inflation. 
<H5>  Financial Consistency </H5>
  The projected fiscal surplus is consistent with the 
aforementioned goal in terms of building up reserves and an 
annual 37.5-percent increase in credit to the private sector. 
The Ministry of Finance has drafted a financial plan to 
determine the deficit that could be financed based on new 
prospects for the balance of payments and the sale of government 
assets. 
  Compared with similar programs drafted in the past, the 
current plan was based on far more restrictive hypotheses, which 
suggests a broad margin of security in planning. In particular, 
assumptions included increased credit to the private sector, 
less growth in the holdings of financial entities, and a higher 
foreign private debt. 
  It was also assumed that the sale of government assets and 
government revenue from the cellular telephone system will 
automatically reduce the capacity of the consolidated financial 
system to grant credits for uses other than the financing of 
such operations. This would happen because the private sector 
would have to borrow (domestically or abroad) or liquidate 
assets in order to finance the purchase of shares and pay 
cellular telephone duties. 
  The main assumptions of the program were: 19-percent 
inflation, a 5-percent increase in the GDP, the accumulation of 
international reserves held by the Bank of the Republic 
amounting to $450 million, a 27-percent expansion in the private 
sector's portfolio (financial savings), a 37.5-percent increase 
in the credit granted by the consolidated financial system to 
the private sector, and a 28-percent increase in the financial 
sector's holdings (excluding the Bank of the Republic). 
  The results of an analysis of macroeconomic consistency show 
that a fiscal surplus of 298 billion pesos, equivalent to 1.48 
percent of the GDP, would have to be generated. The required 
surplus is smaller than that projected for the public sector, as 
previously noted. This means that, instead of excessive 
financial pressure from the public sector, we shall have a 
promising situation from the standpoint of credit available to 
the private sector, which in turn will permit growth in credit, 
and therefore in investment, far exceeding the anticipated 
growth in the GDP. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  We believe that the picture described in this article ends 
once and for all last year's debate on uncontrolled public 
spending, and completely frees the government of any fiscal 
responsibility for any possible increase in the peso. The 
government has taken the necessary measures to guarantee 
exchange stability throughout the year and achieve the goal set 
for inflation. 
  In contrast with the views of economic experts connected 
with 
the different political campaigns, the government believes 
firmly that inflation should steadily drop by the year to 
one-digit levels and has made a major fiscal adjustment in order 
to achieve this goal. However, what is perhaps of greatest 
political importance is that the program will not only provide a 
balanced fiscal administration, but a prosperous one as well. 
  We are working to provide the next administration with 
resources and room to work financially. Turning the good 
prospects that we present into a reality will then depend on the 
Bank of the Republic's proper handling of monetary and exchange 
policies and on the fiscal responsibility of the next 
administration. We have done all we could on the fiscal and 
exchange fronts.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- For the first time in 45 years the 
War College (ESG) opened its doors to a hero of the Cuban 
revolution. About 60 professors, and officers and civilians were 
in the college auditorium to listen to a lecture by Cuban Higher 
Education Minister Fernando Vecino Alegret, who fought next to 
Fidel Castro and was vice minister of the Cuban Revolutionary 
Armed Forces. "Times change," said the former officer, who faced 
in a natural way the fact that the school was a center for 
anti-communist preaching during the military regime. ESG 
Commander Brigadier Sergio Ferolla said: "The doors of the 
school are open to all without restrictions."

  [Text] Health and Social Welfare Minister Vicente Perez 
Davila presented his irrevocable resignation yesterday. Health 
problems related to his gastrointestinal system have forced the 
minister to resign. 
  Perez Davila coordinated the health area of President Rafael 
Caldera's government and later headed the liaison commission 
with the Health and Social Welfare Ministry. 
  In spite of his youth and having a good professional record, 
today Perez Davila is leaving the ministry for health reasons. 
He expressed his regrets to President Rafael Caldera. It was 
learned yesterday morning that Perez Davila sent a letter to the 
president of the Republic in which he explained the reasons for 
his resignation. In that letter he told President Rafael Caldera 
that he is sure the work of the new authorities at the Health 
and Social Welfare Ministry will be successful, because the 
persons working in the ministry are highly qualified and 
motivated. 
  President Caldera will now have to appoint a new health and 
social welfare minister, which must be a person highly qualified 
to direct a ministry confronting a serious hospital crisis.

  [Text] When President Rafael Caldera enacted the Emergency 
Banking Law, he announced that he would immediately present a 
short draft bill to the legislative assembly to partially reform 
the law, arguing that some of the provisions could cause 
difficulties in cleaning up the national financial system. 
  The president made this announcement after signing the law 
in 
the Ayacucho room, Miraflores Palace. Ministers of the Executive 
Cabinet; members of the board of directors of the national 
Congress, represented by Eduardo Gomez Tamayo and Carmelo 
Lauria, president and vice president, respectively; chiefs of 
the Convergence Party, Movement Toward Socialism, Democratic 
Action, and Christian Democratic Party parliamentary wings; Jose 
Baouza Izquierdo, president of the National Banking Board; and 
deputies and senators who are members of the finance commissions 
of the legislative branch were present for the signing. Ruth de 
Krivoy, president of the Central Bank of Venezuela; Deputy 
Walter Marquez, vice president of the commission investigating 
the Banco Latino case; and Gustavo Roosen, president of the 
Banco Latino intervention board, were also present. 
  The head of state said the national government will 
immediately submit a bill to the legislative chambers for 
partial reforms to the law "because the government believes some 
of the approved provisions show that, given the lack of time and 
the praiseworthy urgency with which Congress passed the bill, 
they were not properly studied regarding the possible 
consequences some of the norms might have. Instead of helping to 
stabilize the Venezuelan financial system, which is what 
everyone is worried about, the bill could prevent achieving this 
goal." 
  Caldera said he is sure the atmosphere of dialogue and 
cooperation, which has prevailed among the state branches in 
connection with the bill, will allow the government to receive 
proposals relating to this matter. He said the promulgation of 
the law is encouraging for those who have watched with anguish 
their personal situation in connection with the Banco Latino 
crisis. "I have not hesitated to call this crisis a veritable 
cataclysm, the extent of which has surpassed what was initially 
calculated when President Ramon J. Velasquez decreed the bank's 
intervention." The president said the action is the first step 
in the so-called Solidarity Pledge, in which all public and 
private sector organizations are striving together to counter 
this critical, difficult, and complex situation. 
  Gustavo Tarre Briceno, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies' 
Finance Committee, referred to the law's partial reforms and 
said it deals with the "most urgent things," including a Public 
Credit Law for 400 billion bolivares to finance the Emergency 
Law provisions. The bill, however, will be reviewed calmly with 
the assurance that the account holders' and depositors' 
emergency has been met and modifications can be made in a more 
calm fashion. 
  Congress President Eduardo Gomez Tamayo said he will wait 
until the government proposals are analyzed before he decides to 
declare the partial reforms bill a constitutional emergency. 
Gustavo Roosen, chairman of Banco Latino's Board of Trustees, 
said several of the articles are questionable because they make 
the board's work difficult.

  [Text] The Chamber of Deputies last night approved in the 
first debate the Public Credit Draft Bill totalling 400 billion 
bolivares, which will supplement the newly approved Emergency 
Banking Law. 
  The report, which was presented and prepared by the 
Permanent 
Finance Commission, was submitted to the lawmakers in the lower 
chamber for analysis. It received the support of all parties 
forming the commission, but in the chamber vote the Radical 
Cause Party legislative wing voted against it. 
  In their speeches, representatives of the different 
legislative factions explained that it was meaningless to 
approve the Emergency Banking Law without approving the Public 
Credit Draft Bill, which will permit Fogade [Deposit Guarantee 
Fund] to disburse the necessary resources to aid all financial 
institutions in need of assistance. This assistance will be 
given by issuing public debt bonds totalling 400 billion 
bolivares. 
  Deputy Jose Miguel Uzcategui said the Permanent Finance 
Commission discussed various financing options for the law, such 
as tax reforms, issuing currency, and adopting budget measures. 
He added that the most expeditious, convenient, and orthodox 
way of generating resources is by going into debt, a debt that 
will not have an impact on the market and will not produce 
inflationary effects unless Fogade's authorized capital is 
increased. Uzcategui said that the issue will be discussed 
today by the commission, who will review the observations made 
at the Chamber. He added that during the afternoon session the 
bill will be approved in the second debate. 
  Gustavo Tarre Briceno, chairman of the Permanent Finance 
Commission, said that the Executive Branch is issuing public 
debt bonds and placing the money at Fogade. Tarre Briceno said 
it is not a matter of spending 400 billion bolivares but of 
seeking the mechanisms to create greater confidence among savers 
and depositors throughout the country, offering 400 billion 
bolivares to support their savings as well as generating 
confidence again in the Venezuelan financial system.

  [Text] The Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund] has agreed to 
open a bidding process to let national banks manage assisted 
financial entities, sources in that institution have stated. In 
that respect, it agreed to begin talks with the representatives 
of banks to define the list of financial entities that will 
participate in the bidding process. 
  That proposal is part of the overall rehabilitation plan 
Fogade will impose on all banks that are under the financial 
assistance program. Initially, Fogade had studied the 
possibility of including 12 banks in the process, but the board 
members agreed to decrease the number to eight. 
  The conditions under which banks will take over the 
administration of assisted banks have not yet been defined, but 
the plan calls for temporary external supervision until the 
institutions recover their stability. 
  During a 9 March meeting, the Fogade board members 
considered 
for the first time the possibility of letting national banks 
with a greater solvency manage the assisted banks. Serious 
differences arose among the board members regarding the 
proposal. Some felt that letting the major banks manage the 
assisted banks would generate legal problems, since the process 
may be at odds with the content of the law to promote free 
competition. 
  Next Friday, the Fogade board will study the rehabilitation 
plans that will be established on the Maracaibo, Construccion, 
Barinas, Metropolitano, La Guaira, and Sociedad Financiera 
Fiveca banks. 
  The Banco Barinas Bank, one of the assisted entities, has 
made great strides in its rehabilitation plan. On this matter, 
it was reported that this bank will apply the following measures: 
  -- Merge Banco Popular with Banco Barinas. 
  -- Cut costs by 40 percent. 
  -- Sell some Banco Barinas assets, including its 
headquarters 
in Castellana. 
  -- Allow the contribution of capital by the partners. 
  Regarding the Banco Metropolitano rehabilitation plan, it 
was 
reported that its board members are considering selling assets, 
reducing the managerial staff, and permitting new contributions 
of capital. 
  Banco Metropolitano has already begun talks with a group of 
national and foreign banks to get those entities to become 
partners of this institution. In addition, the Fogade board 
named Manuela Daria and Angel Magdaleno as the administrators of 
Banco Hipotecario de Occidente.

  [Text] Barquisimeto -- Students and police clashed in 
violent street disturbances in various parts of the city for the 
third consecutive day. The students stoned three vehicles, 
destroyed a vegetable market, burned tires, and threw stones. 
Police responded by throwing tear gas. 
  Most of the demonstrators were students at the city's high 
schools and at the technical-industrial school near Libertador, 
Vargas, and Los Abogados Avenues. This time, however, the 
demonstrations spread to other areas of downtown Barquisimeto, 
causing traffic jams. Local store owners decided to close their 
doors this morning to avoid further damage. 
  The students continued to protest the implementation of the 
half bus ticket fare. Miguel Parra, policy director of the 
regional executive, said demonstrators from other states were 
present and described them as professional rabble rousers. 
Three injured students were reportedly taken to Central 
Hospital emergency room, which is in an area where clashes have 
occurred. Access roads to the hospital have been closed, which 
has created problems for patients and hospital personnel, who 
have suffered the effects of tear gas. 
  The demonstrators vandalized a beer truck on Libertador 
Avenue and two public buses. Other groups looted a vegetable 
and fruit market. 
  In view of the violence -- already in its third day -- 
Professor Pablo Sanchez, director of the educational district, 
announced the suspension of classes in high schools that have 
been the focal points for disorder. The measure will be applied 
to all schools that become involved in demonstrations.

  [Text] Luis Eduardo Giusti Lopez has been appointed the new 
president of Venezuela Petroleum Inc. [Petroven] to replace 
Gustavo Roosen, who will continue to head the intervention 
committee at Banco Latino. 
  Giusti entered the oil industry in 1966 through Shell of 
Venezuela, which preceded Maraven, S.A. He has held numerous 
positions in the areas of production, oil bed engineering, and 
planning both in Shell and Maraven. 
  In the announcement about Giusti's appointment, it was 
reported that 2,170,000 barrels of crude oil per day, at an 
average price of $13.34 a barrel, were exported from Venezuela 
in 1993. In other words, the volume exported in 1993 exceeded 
1992 exports by 116,000 barrels daily. It was also said that the 
sales of gasoline produced by the subsidiary (?Cyclop) Petroleum 
in the United States increased by 7 percent. 
  In the refineries located on Venezuelan territory, 950,000 
barrels of oil were processed daily. The Amuay refinery 
processed 440,000 barrels daily; the Cardon refinery, 265,000; 
the Palito refinery, 100,000; and the Puerto la Cruz refinery, 
141,000 barrels daily. The production of diesel with 0.05 
percent sulfur began in the Amuay refinery during this period. 
In addition, the Palito refinery started producing oxygenated 
gasoline to meet the new environmental demands stipulated by the 
U.S. market. 
  In addition, Rossen, head of the Banco Latino intervention 
board, said that a plan to refloat the bank is under way. He 
asked the bank's depositors to keep calm. 
  [Madrid EFE in Spanish at 2340 GMT on 18 March reports that, 
according to Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Arrieta, President 
Caldera on 18 March removed the entire Petroven board of 
directors and appointed Giusti].

military groups linked to the 27 February [1992] coup attempt. 
At 1330, Lieutenant Colonel Jesus Urdaneta Hernandez, Major 
Pedro Emilio Alastre Lopez, Captain Wilmer Barrientos Fernandez, 
Capt. Miguel Rodriguez Torres, Capt. Luis Henry Jatar, Lt. Oscar 
Carrizal Flores, Lt. Florencio Porras Equezuria, and Lt. Nicolas 
Tejas Arrieta were freed. The usual gestures of happiness could 
be seen among friends and relatives awaiting them at the doors 
of the San Carlos headquarters from where they were transferred 
to their respective posts. 
  Only two were discharged: Lt. Urdenta Hernandez and Maj. 
Alastre Lopez. Reporters waited in vain for two hours for the 
announced statements by Lt. Col. Urdaneta, who decided to 
quickly leave the area instead. Only 29 cases remain, and they 
expect to be pardoned in the coming weeks.

  [Text] Caracas, 18 Mar (EFE) -- Official sources confirmed 
today the Venezuelan Government will study the possibility of 
renewing oil supplies to Cuba based on an agreement with Russia. 
  Venezuela supplied between 60,000 and 70,000 barrels of oil 
per day to Cuba up to the latter part of 1991, based on an 
agreement in which the former Soviet Union supplied a similar 
amount of oil to the refineries of state-owned Venezuelan 
Petroleum in Europe. 
  Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Arrieta said the 
possibility of renewing this agreement "is an international 
policy decision" which the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry will 
handle. 
  The initial agreement was suspended after the Soviet Union 
disappeared, but both Russian and Cuban authorities, who have 
visited Venezuela, have expressed their interest in renewing the 
agreement. 
  Arrieta did not reveal if the agreement will continue under 
the former premises. A Russian delegation that visited 
Venezuela in late 1993 reported the idea is for Cuba to pay for 
the oil by supplying them with sugar. 
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas said 
this week Cuban authorities have "a great interest" in reaching 
an agreement on this matter and that it will be one of the 
topics to be discussed during Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomydin's visit to Venezuela in June.

  [Text] Montevideo, 17 Mar (EFE) -- Financial sources report 
that the IMF has approved the Uruguayan Government economic 
program for 1994. The program predicts a 36 percent inflation 
rate and a monetary devaluation of 27 percent for the year. 
  The forecasted inflation rate involves controlling prices: 
In 
1993 it totalled 52.68 percent. 
  The planned monetary devaluation remains at previous levels; 
in 1993 it totalled 26.88 percent. 
  The IMF experts finished studying the economic program in 
early March. Next month the IMF board will analyze the economic 
situation in Uruguay. 
  Once IMF approval is received, Uruguay will have important 
support abroad that will create confidence among potential 
foreign investors and allow the country to obtain credit lines 
from other international organizations.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Uruguay monitored through 17 
March. 
  The central government registered a $31 million surplus in 
January, which is substantially lower than the same month last 
year, when it was $71.7 million. The central government's fiscal 
deficit was $127.6 million in 1993. (Montevideo BUSQUEDA in 
Spanish 3 Mar 94 p 18) 
  The National Statistics Institute reported that in January 
the minimum salary was readjusted 2.36 percent for the private 
sector and 10.46 percent for public employees. The real salary 
increased 1.85 percent above the 3.41 percent January inflation 
rate. (Montevideo BUSQUEDA in Spanish 3 Mar 94 pp 22, 23) 
  The Inter-American Development Bank on 9 March approved a 
$30 
million loan to implement a program designed to improve social, 
health, education, and labor policies, and to modernize court 
administration. (Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 10 Mar 94 p 12) 
  The executive branch eliminated the tax on the purchase of 
foreign currencies used for foreign exchange activities by 
public banks. The banks affected by the measure are the 
Uruguayan Central Bank, the Bank of Uruguay, and the Uruguayan 
Mortgage Bank. (Montevideo Radio Carve in Spanish 0000 GMT 17

<F P=106> [Article by Ribamar Oliveira and Paulo Sotero] </F>
  [Text] Washington -- Contrary to government expectations, 
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus yesterday postponed 
announcing the approval of a standby agreement with Brazil. He 
said a decision would "probably" be made after the third stage 
of the FHC2 Plan [Fernando Henrique Cardoso's second plan], when 
the URV [real value unit] becomes the real. Until then, 
Camdessus proposed to Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
"close cooperation within an IMF monitoring program." 
  Even though he did not announce the standby agreement, 
Camdessus did everything possible to make clear his support for 
"Cardoso's efforts to stabilize the Brazilian economy." In a 
joint appearance with the minister, Camdessus expressed his 
inclination to support Brazil's economic plan and continue 
working with the Brazilian Government. 
  Stressing the importance of using "appropriate language," 
Camdessus read a communique in which he summarized what he 
called the country's "significant progress" in fighting 
inflation; a fiscal program that anticipates a zero operational 
deficit, a primary surplus of more than 4 percent of the GDP, 
the acceleration of the privatization program, strong monetary 
policies, and the conclusion of an agreement to restructure 
Brazil's debt with banks. 
  The doubt created by the communique is whether it will be 
enough to convince the U.S. Treasury Department to issue the 
bonds that will serve to consolidate the agreement with banks, 
which has already been signed, but which according to 
contractual conditions can only become effective if the Treasury 
issues the appropriate guarantee mechanisms. 
  During the afternoon Cardoso had a meeting with Treasury 
Under Secretary Lawrence Summers to discuss the issue. "I am 
sure we already have the formula to close an agreement with the 
banks," Cardoso said before the meeting. At the Treasury 
Camdessus' statements were considered "a very positive 
development." An official source said that the condition for 
the issuing of guarantees has always been "an adequate 
agreement" with the IMF. This might indicate a more flexible 
position on the part of the U.S. Government, which conditioned 
the issuing of the guarantee bonds to Brazil's signing of the 
standby agreement with the IMF. 
  The main difficulty with the IMF is the doubts of the 
experts 
who visited Brazil. The experts doubt that the fiscal 
adjustment will effectively achieve an operational balancing of 
public accounts with an appreciable drop in the inflation rate. 
The experts warned the government that when inflation drops 
there will be a substantial drop in revenues, and budget 
disbursements will increase. 
  Central Bank President Pedro Malan, Economic Policy 
Secretary 
Winston Fritsch, and BNDES [National Bank for Economic and 
Social Development] President Persio Arida are discussing with 
IMF experts several budget disbursement projections based on a 
monthly inflation rate close to zero. If we are to go by 
Camdessus' remarks, everything seems to indicate that the 
Brazilian mission has not yet convinced the IMF. 
  Camdessus said that the IMF will continue preparing the 
technical memorandum on the program, and will present a report 
to the executive board "as soon as possible." This will be 
serve, at the right time, as the basis for a letter of intent on 
a program to be implemented in the second half of 1994 and for a 
basic 1995 economic model.

  [Text] Brazil today reached an agreement with the Creditor 
Banks Committee even without the IMF's participation. The 
announcement was made today by Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso in New York. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Paulo Henrique Amorim] Minister 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso today received from the Brazilian 
representative at the World Bank, Marcos Caramuru, information 
on the decision just made by the creditor banks. Cardoso then 
talked with reporters. 
  [Cardoso] We are, therefore, in a condition to say that by 
15 
April, which is the deadline, the foreign debt issue will 
definitely be a closed issue. 
  [Amorim] In other words, after 11 years Brazil finally has a 
final agreement with the creditor banks. 
  [Cardoso] That is right, after 11 years. I believe the banks 
committee decision conveys to the financial community that 
Brazil is now solvent, that it is even with its foreign debt. 
  [Amorim] Now that this problem has been solved, does your 
candidacy for the presidency become more or less feasible? 
  [Cardoso] No, that makes Brazilian growth more feasible, the 
economic program more feasible; I believe in a short time it 
will allow the so-called risk interest rate to fall because 
there will be no reasons for that, because we will no longer 
have any problems with the international financial community. 
Any candidacy based on an economic program of the type we 
proposed, but not necessarily mine, will be stronger. 
  [Amorim] Nothing resembles the program of Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso more than Fernando Henrique Cardoso. 
  [Cardoso] Certainly, the program is really close if not 
identical to my beliefs. I say it is not perhaps identical 
because the program is not mine alone; it is also the country's. 
But I believe this program is an important program. I believe 
the acceptance made in the foreign debt negotiations is a vote 
of confidence. Even when we did not yet have the final and 
necessary guarantees for an agreement, we already had obtained 
from the international financial community a very clear signal 
that Brazil has all the necessary conditions for growth. And I 
believe anyone who bets on that will bet on Brazil, and betting 
on Brazil means he will have a chance to win for the benefit of 
Brazil. I repeat, it is not necessary that I be the one, but 
someone like me. [end recording] 
  The Banks Committee has suggested that the Brazilian 
creditor 
banks grant a waiver [preceding word in English], that is, a 
pardon for the Brazilian Government, to close the foreign debt 
negotiations even without an agreement with the IMF. The banks 
have until 24 March to reply. The pardon will only be possible 
if it is approved by two-thirds of the creditors.

<F P=106> [Article by "special correspondent" Ribamar Oliveira] </F>
  [Text] New York -- Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso on 18 March said that if he decides to run for the 
presidency he will not be "the anti-Lula [Workers Party, PT, 
candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva] candidate." Cardoso, who is 
in New York negotiating a debt agreement with creditor banks, 
said the IMF directorate is aware of the possibility that he may 
leave the ministry to run for the elections and that such a 
situation would not harm the negotiations. The following are the 
main points of his news conference: 
  Candidacy -- "If I were a candidate, I would not be the 
anti-Lula candidate. That is a mistake. But I have not decided 
yet whether I will be a candidate. My dilemma is not that. I 
must see whether the economic stabilization plan can be 
maintained if I leave the ministry. It is not an elementary 
issue. Frankly, I'd rather support some other candidate." 
  PT -- "The PT's problem is that it is a party that has very 
defined ideas that go against the current issues. The PT has 
never assumed a negotiating position and that makes things 
difficult. The PT presupposes that it has an inherited or divine 
right to govern the country. This is a mistake that makes them 
assume a presumptuous and mistaken attitude. If it were not for 
that reason we could negotiate even with the PT. But with that 
attitude it is very difficult." 
  Alliances -- "We also made an effort with the PMDB 
[Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party]. But nobody knows who will be the 
PMDB candidate. Talks with the PFL [Liberal Front Party] were 
suspended because it is too early to discuss alliances. It is 
true that no one will be able to govern alone in this country. 
The people currently want a common plan among the country's 
political forces. We are offering the people a real plan, a real 
path. Those who attack us are not presenting alternatives. 
Everyone knows it is necessary to establish a path. The 
stabilization of our currency is only a precondition to deal 
with the major national problems." 
  IMF -- "I did not discuss the issue of my candidacy with the 
IMF. It would have been inappropriate. Despite the rumors and 
insinuations in Brazil, I have not made a decision yet about my 
candidacy. But the IMF directors know I could become a 
candidate. I do not believe my candidacy would affect relations 
with the IMF." 
  Constitution Revision Process -- "Anyone who has a notion of 
what is going on in Brazil knows it is necessary to amend the 
Constitution. Not many articles must be modified and I think 
there already exists a consensus about them. Maybe this 
consensus is not sensed in Congress, but it does exist in 
society." 
  Veto -- "This is not the moment for discussing wage 
privileges for the public sector. The fact that the Chamber of 
Deputies has not understood this is very serious."

<F P=106> [Article by William Franca from the Brasilia Bureau] </F>
  [Text] The Chamber of Deputies on 16 March rejected 
President Itamar Franco's veto of an article of the law that 
establishes public employees' salaries and increased their 
salaries to the same level as those of the justices of the 
Supreme Court. This represents a real increase of 23.66 percent 
as of March. Ministers will also benefit from the measure and 
receive a 95.14 percent hike. The move was voted on in a secret 
session and must be approved by a majority in the Senate (which 
did not have a quorum on 16 March). 
  If the Senate ratifies the decision, federal deputies, 
senators, ministers, and Supreme Court justices will receive in 
March the equivalent of 6,123.51 URV's [Real Value Unit] (in 
other words, 4,699,606.77 cruzeiros at the 16 March URV rate). 
This decision will generate "a domino effect" because the 
internal rules and regulations of Congress allows for the 
revision of the salaries of all other employees to maintain 
parity. This will also occur in the state legislatures and 
municipal town halls where salaries are pegged to those of 
federal deputies, the National Accounting Office, and the 
Attorney General's Office. 
  Within the executive branch, the rejection of the veto will 
permit employees of state and semi-state enterprises, such as 
Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation], the Central Bank, 
and the Federal Police to have their salaries readjusted. No 
estimation has been made of how much this will increase the 
payroll.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Preliminary government estimates show 
that the Chamber of Deputies decision to increase the salaries 
of legislators, and the Supreme Court ruling to move forward the 
date by 10 days for calculating the mean salary level used to 
convert salaries to URV's [Real Value Unit], will cost the 
government an additional $270 million. This could climb to $2.1 
billion during the year if civilian and military public servants 
demand their share according to the salary equity principle. 
Labor Minister Walter Barelli, who worked out the figures, 
regretted the decision. He considers it harmful to the economic 
plan. In Washington, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
said he hopes "the Senate will have the political insight to see 
that this measure cannot be approved now." 
  "It was an unforgivable and unjustifiable decision. We 
cannot promote salary equality through speeches," Cardoso said. 
"If the veto is overridden we will have to cut other expenses, 
perhaps funds allotted to the Chamber of Deputies itself." The 
minister said the government is aware that salaries in some 
categories are too low, but this is not the way to solve the 
problem. Barelli said the new measure means government spending 
will amount to almost half what it expects to collect with the 
IPMF [Provisional Tax on Financial Operations]. This will be the 
case if all public servants demand and obtain equal treatment. 
  The labor minister made these remarks following a special 
meeting of the Severance Pay Fund (FGTS) Oversight Board. 
Barelli said the government is aware of the decision and is 
preparing to face the problem, which he classified as a power 
jurisdiction problem. Barelli said the issue is being analyzed 
by the government attorney because it violates the principle of 
salary equity, which is a constitutional tenet. 
  The greatest government fear is that the legislative branch 
decision and the Supreme Court ruling might provoke a chain 
reaction involving civilian and military federal employees. 
They can use the same salary equity principle to get their 
salaries raised the way it was done by the Chamber of Deputies, 
overriding the presidential veto which reestablished the salary 
ceiling for public employees as the amount earned by ministers. 
The same can happen with the Supreme Court decision to move the 
date for calculating the mean salary level for the past four 
months from the 30th to the 20th of each month. The decision 
will result in higher salary levels at the time of converting 
them to URV's.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- Navy Minister Admiral Ivan Serpa 
has criticized the decision of the Chamber of Deputies to 
increase the salaries of its members. 
  He stressed: "This makes even more unattainable the proposal 
for salary equity between branches of government and increases 
unrest." He stated that the military has accumulated a very 
significant loss in purchasing power. He cited his own case: 
"In March 1990, while in the post of squadron commander, I 
received a salary equivalent to $3,000: Today I receive the 
equivalent of $1,200." 
  The minister said the lack of motivation within the 
organization is so perceptible that 49 Navy officers are 
pursuing other posts within the state itself. The admiral 
vehemently defended the FHC2 [Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso-2] plan on the "Tomorrow's Journal" program broadcast by 
TVE [Rio de Janeiro Educativa Television] on 16 March. "If 
inflation drops there will be a gradual recovery in purchasing 
power and we are betting on this," he said. 
  When fiscal and monetary adjustments attain their goals, 
previous losses lose significance, he commented. The minister 
also defended a return of investments to modernize the Armed 
Forces and the creation of a salary program for the military 
once stabilization has been achieved. 
  Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party-Rio Grande do Sul State], the government leader [in the 
Senate], and Senator Jose Richa (PSDB-PR) [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party-Parana State], are heading the movement in the 
Senate to maintain President Itamar Franco's veto against the 
salary equity between congressmen and Supreme Court (STF) 
judges. "It is an act of immorality that will have a 
devastating effect on the economic stabilization plan," Richa 
stressed. Richa and Simon on 16 March began to press their 
colleagues on the "unsuitability of the increase." On 17 March, 
the senators were convinced that their pressing would work. "It 
is a delicate situation; the Senate must be seen to maintain the 
veto," Simon said. 
  The greatest difficulty to overcome is the blockade imposed 
by their colleagues that will lose their mandates this year 
because they will not seek reelection. One party leader said 
there is a group of senators leaving public life which will vote 
against the veto. "They wish to take advantage of the salary 
increase at least for the next few months," the leader said.

<F P=106> [Article by Sandra Brasi and Mirian Guaraciaba] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- The decisions of the national Congress 
and the Federal Supreme Court [STF] to establish privileges for 
public employees -- the so-called maharajas -- and increase 
their own salaries have irritated the military ministers so much 
that they asked for a meeting with President Itamar Franco. 
  Called for 1600, the ministers of the Army, Zenildo Lucena; 
Aeronautics, Lelio Lobo; Navy, Ivan Serpa; EMFA [Armed Forces 
Staff], Arnaldo Leite Pereira; and nine other ministers met with 
Franco to discuss the problem created by Congress' rejection of 
the presidential vetoes of the Salary Equity Law and by the 
STF's approval of a real 10.9 percent salary increase for 
employees of the legislative and judicial branches and the 
Attorney General's Office. 
  The salary increase was obtained through the salary 
conversion to URV's [Real Value Unit] by using a different base 
date from that determined by the government provisional measure. 
  "They sent us to the kitchen with the great mass of public 
employees, while they remained in the living room," a general 
said in irritation. 
  The military was taken by surprise by the decision by 
Congress and the STF just when they were beginning to accept the 
government's refusal to grant the troops a 35 percent wage 
increase claimed since last November. 
  The military ministers stressed the fact that the pressures 
for a wage increase come from the bases. And they feel obliged 
to give an explanation to the troops. Their irritation is so 
great that they even questioned democratic stability. 
  "When the exercise of democracy is so sensitive to the point 
of meeting the demands of groups or individuals, democracy is 
weak," an active-duty military officer said. 
  The military's disgust was sensed by the president of the 
Republic early on the afternoon of 18 March when he received in 
his office a manifesto signed by more than 100 military 
personnel, including retired General Euclides Figueiredo, 
brother of former President Joao Batista Figueiredo. In the 
document, the soldiers preach the closure of Congress and the 
replacement of the STF justices by career judges. 
  A retired officer with influence on the president's office 
attacked: "If it were up to me, they would all be arrested," he 
said, meaning the STF justices. 
  Before attending the meeting in Planalto Palace, SAF 
[Federal 
Administration Secretary] Romildo Canhim said democracy is not 
threatened.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The future of the constitutional 
revision process will be decided on 22 March during a meeting of 
party leaders and Congress President Senator Humberto Lucena 
(PMDB-PB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Paraiba]). The 
suggestion to hold the meeting to see whether the constitutional 
revision process takes off once and for all was made by the PMDB 
leader in the lower house, Deputy Tarcicio Delgado (MG [Minas 
Gerais]), who believes the work will not continue. 
  "Either the constitutional revision is made, or it is not. 
We 
must make a decision in order not to act like clowns. Right now, 
attention is centered on the economic plan, the stripping of the 
political rights of congressmen, and the election race," Delgado 
said. 
  The proposal of PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] 
leader Deputy Artur da Tavola (RJ [Rio de Janeiro]) to suspend 
the constitutional revision work after voting on subjects of 
consensus and to resume the work in 1995 is gaining force in 
Congress. Tavola believes he has found a formula to make the 
proposal legally feasible. He maintains that the power to amend 
the Constitution could be delegated to another congress by 
including an article in the chapter of temporary provisions of 
the Constitution. 
  Deputy Miro Teixeira [PDT [Democratic Labor Party]-RJ) 
agrees 
with constitutional revision rapporteur Deputy Nelson Jobim 
(PMDB-RS [Rio Grande do Sul]) that any proposal to suspend the 
work is unconstitutional. He said the anticipated promulgation 
of the Social Emergency Fund (FSE) has frozen the deadline of 
the revision work in order to prevent questioning by the STF 
[Federal Supreme Court].

  [Excerpts] Salvador, Bahia -- Chamber of Deputies President 
Inocencio de Oliveira (PFL [Liberal Front Party]) agrees with 
postponing the Constitution revision process until next year, as 
suggested by PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] leader 
Artur da Tavola (RJ [Rio de Janeiro]). PT [Workers Party] 
presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva also favors 
this idea. Oliveira believes that to close the current 
Constitution revision process now and reopen it in 1995 may 
solve the impasse of the Constitution revision work. 
  "I believe it is a solution that might satisfy the people if 
the most important amendments are not approved by 31 May," Lula 
said. 
  Lula, who attended a demonstration against the end of the 
monopolies in the oil and telecommunications industries in 
Salvador, believes the political atmosphere does not favor the 
constitutional revision. 
  "The PT not only supports the postponement of the work, but 
also thanks God that the congressmen have had a little bit of 
good sense to understand that the revision process cannot 
continue under the current circumstances," Lula added. [passage 
omitted] 
  After the dedication of the Sarah Hospital in Salvador, 
Oliveira nonetheless admitted there are two obstacles to 
Tavola's suggestion: the amendments that already have been 
approved and the 31 May deadline approved by the Constituent 
Congress. 
  But Oliveira believes the issue should be taken to the 
Federal Supreme Court based on the fact that the temporary 
Constitution measures that authorized the amendment process did 
not include a deadline for finishing the revision works.

  [Text] Cuban Ambassador to Brazil Jorge Bolanos has said 
the U.S. attitude toward Cuba "is changing." He said there is 
no longer consensus among U.S. citizens of Cuban descent about 
whether Washington's economic embargo -- which has been in force 
since 1960 -- should be maintained. "Most are against it," he 
said. 
  Bolanos, 55, was interviewed by FOLHA during a farewell 
dinner offered by the Brazilian-Cuban Chamber of Commerce in Sao 
Paulo. He said it was "entirely contradictory" for the United 
States to maintain the embargo on Cuba since revoked in February 
the similar sanctions it imposed on Vietnam. "Both countries 
are Communist, both have a single party system, and both have a 
centralized economy." 
  Bolanos does not believe the UN Human Rights Commission 11 
March decision to condemn Cuba reflects the country's isolation. 
"It just proves the organization is subordinated to the United 
States." 
  He said he believes the opening of the Cuban economy will 
not 
destabilize its political system. He cited the former USSR as 
an example of the "illusion of capitalism" and mentioned the PRC 
and Vietnam as examples of Communist countries that have 
modernized their economies without losing political stability. 
  Bolanos, the first ambassador to Brazil since the two 
countries resumed diplomatic relations seven years ago, will 
become the Cuban deputy foreign minister.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- For the first time in 45 years the 
War College (ESG) opened its doors to a hero of the Cuban 
revolution. About 60 professors, and officers and civilians were 
in the college auditorium to listen to a lecture by Cuban Higher 
Education Minister Fernando Vecino Alegret, who fought next to 
Fidel Castro and was vice minister of the Cuban Revolutionary 
Armed Forces. "Times change," said the former officer, who faced 
in a natural way the fact that the school was a center for 
anti-communist preaching during the military regime. ESG 
Commander Brigadier Sergio Ferolla said: "The doors of the 
school are open to all without restrictions."

  [Text] Mexico City, 19 Mar (EFE) -- The rebel leader known 
as Subcommander Marcos warned today that the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army (EZLN) could attack again if the Mexican Armed 
Forces continues their harassment. 
  Marcos told local media that some EZLN members were tortured 
after their capture on 6 March and said that if the situation 
continues, the rebels could take up arms again and repel any 
attack. 
  "Everything indicates that a military offensive is being 
prepared regardless of the results of the consultations" held 
after the peace talks with the government and that "the Army has 
already begun to mobilize," Marcos said. 
  The guerrilla leader added that the Armed Forces have been 
constantly harassing the EZLN by detaining Indians, patrolling 
the area, and collecting military information. 
  Marcos said that all of these actions have forced the 
Zapatists to change their minds about peace and prepare for a 
probable counterattack. 
  "We could go into action again. We cannot trust a government 
that talks of peace while taking warlike actions," he stated. 
  Marcos said everything indicates that the government is 
seeking a military solution, not a political one. He explained 
that currently there is no peace agreement, only a government 
proposal that is being studied by the Indian communities. 
  Marcos also said that the EZLN has received information 
about 
a probable military attack on the Zapatists before May to 
annihilate the guerrillas before the presidential campaign 
enters its most critical stage. "The government's wants to 
behead our movement by removing the leadership in a surgical 
operation," he reported. 
  Marcos said 10 Zapatists have been detained since the Armed 
Forces began to patrol Indian communities. These persons are 
probably questioned to learn more about the guerrillas' 
strategies and positions. 
  He said that the government's actions will only increase the 
EZLN's distrust of the government and, if the Army attempts to 
attack Zapatista positions, the guerrillas will respond in kind. 
The present truce in Chiapas, he said, is an "undeclared war" 
that will quickly break out again if the government decides to 
attack. 
  The armed conflict in Chiapas began on 1 January when the 
EZLN took up arms against the government. The EZLN engaged the 
Mexican Army in bloody combat early in the conflict, resulting 
in at least 150 dead, 500 wounded, and some 20,000 refugees, 
according to unofficial figures.

<F P=106> [Report by David Aponte; quotation marks as published] </F>
  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, 17 Mar -- The 
delegates of the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee 
(CCRI)- General Command of the Zapatist National Liberation Army 
(EZLN) have concluded the first phase of analyzing the 
commitments for an honorable peace in Chiapas. The delegates 
returned to their communities to explain the contents of the 
document. 
  According to reports obtained here, the analysis process in 
the Zapatist communities will begin during the weekend. 
  EZLN delegates have told this newspaper the discussion in 
the 
communities will take some time, because the wording of the 
commitments is "complicated," and the communities are very 
distant. 
  At the end of the first phase of the internal consultation, 
they reiterated their concern over the "continuity" of the 
commitments for an honorable peace in Chiapas, in light of the 
upcoming change of the federal executive. 
  "We do not know if the proposals will be complied with by 
Salinas' successor," the delegates have argued. 
  CCRI representatives have considered the federal 
government's 
compliance will be a fundamental "condition" for true peace in 
Chiapas. 
  Committee delegates Pedro, Romeo, Carlos, and Emanuel have 
said the consultation in the communities will take some time, 
because the wording of the government commitments is 
"complicated," and the Zapatist communities are very distant. 
  About 300 CCRI representatives who participated in the first 
phase of the study began returning gradually to their hometowns 
on 16 March. 
  Meanwhile, the delegates have said the EZLN has not yet 
decided whether there will be a second phase of dialogue with 
Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis or the manner in which 
the contents of the 32 peace commitments will be approved. 
  During a short conversation in a CCRI-controlled area, the 
representatives have said the advancements of the consultation 
in its initial stage are minimum. The delegates have analyzed 
point by point the commitments for an honorable peace in 
Chiapas. "We are not in a hurry," and the most important thing 
is to understand the contents of the texts, they have said. 
  Emanuel has remarked the Clandestine Committee has analyzed 
carefully the government commitments, "and if they are not 
fulfilled, we will continue the war. We are very tired." 
  The Zapatist representatives have returned to their 
communities with the texts translated into Tzotzil, Tzeltal, 
Chol, and Tojolabal, so as to explain to children, youths, and 
elderly people the scope of the proposals. "They will say what 
they think, but we do not think the government will comply," he 
has said. 
  It is necessary for all members of the communities to 
understand "there is nothing yet" from the dialogue in San 
Cristobal de las Casas; there is no agreement, he added. 
  CCRI delegates have said, however, the EZLN is interested in 
the follow-up of the government commitments, given the change of 
president. "Salinas' departure is nearing, and we do not know 
if his successor will maintain his policies," Emanuel has said. 
  Romeo has warned the federal government's compliance with 
the 
political and social requests is a fundamental "condition" for 
true peace in Chiapas. 
  [LA JORNADA] What is going to happen with the weapons? 
  [Romeo] The weapons. One can never surrender the weapons, 
but the government must meet the people's needs. This is the 
only thing for what we are asking; we are asking for at least 
for democracy. We want our rights to be considered. All our 
comrades, men, women, children, and elderly people are 
practically abandoned. 
  "You are realizing how the regions and towns are; they are 
very screwed up. Just look at the roads, the pasture grounds, 
how pasture grounds grow on stony grounds. We want the 
government to hurry up. We can give the government a short term 
for meeting our needs. We want the government to supply for 
what we are asking, because we are dying. 
  "Years and years of death. So far it would be better to die 
while fighting, but if the government meets its word, we would 
be glad. We want a real and lasting peace, not just words: We 
want deeds," Romeo has added. 
  The delegates have returned to their communities, many of 
which are located four or five days away by foot. The initial 
stage in the communities will begin during the weekend, 
according to the CCRI.

  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 17 March -- We the 
cattlemen do not respond to provocations, but we will definitely 
not accept the government's intended expropriations. We demand 
that the ejidos, the small properties, the Constitution, and the 
law be respected, said Cesar Gonzalez Quiroga, president of the 
National Confederation of Cattlemen [CNG]. 
  Octovio Albores Cruz, state leader of the National Peasant 
Confederation [CNC], reported that the Chiapas government will 
form an investigative commission on squatting. The CNC will 
participate in this commission to see that the presidential 
resolutions are based on documents and appropriately carried out. 
  Albores Cruz maintained that the union he chairs does not 
support squatting. Nevertheless, he warned that once all the 
appeals run out and if there is no reply to the peasants' 
demands, "I will not be ashamed to say: Let them squat." 
  Peasants from the San Cristobal de las Casas region are 
demanding compensation for nationalized lands, small properties, 
and agriculture colonies of 27 ejidos of Cintalapa Municipality. 
  During a special session of the CNG National Assembly to 
support the Chiapas cattle ranchers, Cesar Gonzalez Quiroga 
urged the ranchers to remain calm, although he insisted that the 
sector has been accused of being Satanic, which is unjust. All 
the cattle ranchers of Chiapas and Mexico are working people, he 
noted. 
  Gonzalez Quiroga said in a annoyed tone: "We have respected 
the institutions; we have not taken up arms; we are not accusing 
anyone; we do not have white guards [guardias blancas]. We have 
tractors, plow, and a willingness to work. We will continue to 
act within the institutions because we believe that matters 
should be solved correctly." 
  In Gonzalez Quiroga's opinion, the Chiapas conflict is a 
priority and a cause of concern for all Mexicans. He also 
expressed his desire for a true peace process. He added, 
however, that once the peace process has concluded, the CNG take 
up its problem once again. 
  He was then asked: "When will the cattle ranchers' good 
sense 
prevail?" 
  I cannot answer for each and every one of them. The call is 
for calm and for the problem to be solved. The government is 
willing to solve the problem. We have faith and trust in 
President Carlos Salinas. 
  Meanwhile, Alberto Marin Toache, president of the Regional 
Cattle Ranchers Union of Northern Chiapas, said that so long as 
squatting -- an attack on private property -- continues, "there 
will not be peace." 
  Marin Toache said: "Signing a document does not achieve 
peace, particularly because we do not have faith that the 
signing of a document with the Zapatists will produce a lasting 
peace or that the document is valid." 
  To sign something firm, the cattlemen's leader insisted, all 
those involved must participate, because the unknown, the 
hooded, and the masked can retract tomorrow.

<F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpt] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's statements 
during a breakfast meeting in Mexico City have sparked much 
interest among the attending diplomats. During the final phase 
of the meeting, he took a question from one of the ambassadors. 
The Nicaraguan ambassador asked a question regarding the future 
dissolution or reduction of the Guatemalan Army. 
  [Begin recording] [Nicaraguan Ambassador Jose Ernesto 
Fonseca] [Words indistinct] 
  [De Leon Carpio] Army reduction in our case is not viable, 
and I believe in general this is not possible, because even 
countries that supposedly have no armies do in fact have them. 
Our Constitution clearly establishes the presence and 
establishment of a single army and does not accept another armed 
group or any irregulars; thus, according to the president, there 
is no room for this topic. 
  Regarding the first part, indeed there have been talks 
within 
the Armed Forces on retraining and even on reduction. A study 
is being undertaken in accordance with Guatemalan Army plans and 
with conditions that are going to take place, but naturally the 
armed conflict must end before this can happen. It is 
impossible to ask for an Army reduction while subversives are 
present, while there is an enemy inside the country. 
  Much has been said about the Civil Defense Patrols, and I am 
going to broach the subject right away, because there have been 
requests for their dissolution. They form part of, precisely, 
Guatemala's defense system. The Civil Defense Patrols are 
groups of people who have joined together. There have been many 
discussions as to whether they are really volunteers. A poll 
was taken recently by the human rights ombudsman, who replaced 
me, and the result was very surprising, as far as the level of 
volunteers is concerned, by those who comprise the so-called 
PAC's, Civilian Self-Defense Patrols, which are now called 
Civilian Defense Volunteer Committees. 
  Much has been said to the effect they should be dissolved, 
because some members of these patrols commit abuses; this is 
true, and we admit it. We are aware of this and have issued 
orders that whenever these abuses take place, when these occur 
and illegal acts or crimes are committed, they will be placed on 
trial just like any ordinary citizen. We admit they have caused 
us problems, but to go as far as eliminating those who have 
halted the advance of subversion is illogical and naive. 
  In Guatemala, many groups are asking for the elimination of 
these defense volunteers, not only groups within Guatemala but 
groups abroad, and I have always said when groups like this 
request this elimination, they are either naive or do not want 
the subversives' advance to be stemmed. 
  These civilian defense patrols have been an example the 
world 
over on the way one can counter and hinder the advance of 
guerrilla warfare to such an extent that many countries have 
regrettably copied this. I say regrettably, because I regret 
guerrilla warfare has also taken place in other countries. 
  Other countries have copied the way our people--who are 
angered by their sufferings, their orphans, their widows, 
etc.--have become organized to defend themselves. It is 
difficult for the Guatemalan Army or any other Army in the world 
to control terrorists' advances. The organized civilian efforts 
have furthered our country's military defense, however, because 
they have stopped the guerrilla's advances; this is what they 
have done and that is why we have won the military war. The 
rebels have been militarily defeated. 
  In this respect, I would like to add there is already a 
disposition for [words indistinct] in the places where there is 
no confrontation. The defense minister will confirm there are 
no guerrillas in two-thirds of the country, and in the other 
[words indistinct] there are no Civilian Defense patrols. 
  I have noticed, however, there is a great deal of confusion 
regarding groups such as the Civilian Defense Patrols and the 
Peace and Development Committees. They are very well-organized 
groups, which, in the future, when they no longer need weapons, 
can be of great help in furthering economic and social 
development in their own communities. We would like the defense 
minister to add to our comments. 
  [Guatemalan Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez Morales] 
[Passage omitted] Messrs Ambassadors: With regard to 
dissolving, reducing, modifying, or renovating the Army, we 
[words indistinct] a draft to the president of the Republic on 
how to renovate the Guatemalan Army once the guerrilla threat 
has ended. Many of the suggested actions are already being 
implemented by those who have the constitutional responsibility 
to do so and in compliance with the orders of the constitutional 
president of the Republic. We believe those reforms will allow 
us to modify and strengthen certain areas; for example, [words 
indistinct], to become more effective. 
  The Army reforms will allow us to change quantity for 
quality. The measures have to be organized and will include the 
[words indistinct] studies from the military academy, the 
university, and the centers for military studies. A person who 
graduates as an officer cannot be ranked as such if he does not 
have a [words indistinct] of a liberal career. Nobody will be 
able to take [words indistinct] course and much less the command 
staff course if he does not have a university degree or a 
master's degree in any of the liberal disciplines. This program, 
gentlemen, has already started. [Passage indistinct]... because 
there is still an ongoing armed conflict. There is, however, 
[words indistinct] to change quantity for quality in the 
Guatemalan Army. The president of the Republic knows this well 
and, moreover, he has approved such efforts. I do not want to 
take more of your time, so I will not add further. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz from the "ACIR Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari affirmed that 
his administration has fulfilled its commitment to keep the oil 
industry under Mexican control and ownership. He added that 
Pemex [Mexican Petroleum] had been restructured and strengthened 
because, otherwise, it would have deteriorated into an 
unproductive and weak corporation thereby becoming easy prey for 
local and foreign, private interests. 
  At midday today at the main Pemex administration offices, 
President Salinas led the ceremonies marking the 56th oil 
nationalization anniversary. This was the sixth and last [Pemex] 
public ceremony the president will attend before his term in 
office expires. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] The government's responsibility 
toward this enterprise can only be fulfilled if we establish 
conditions that guarantee Pemex's future permanence as a 
nationalized enterprise. We have worked expressly to fulfill 
that duty and the facts prove this. I hereby state that Pemex is 
stronger because it is more productive and efficient. On the 
domestic front, Pemex can guarantee the country's energy needs; 
it strengthens the public economy for social spending; it 
increases its own reserves and investments; and restructures its 
activities. Pemex's fortitude is enhanced abroad because we did 
not allow any international relationship whatsoever that could 
subjugate Pemex decisions to any other will than that of the 
Mexican people. [end recording] 
  Cabinet members and representatives of government branches, 
workers unions, and business organizations attended the 
ceremony. The president recognized Pemex General Director 
Francisco Rojas' honesty and dedication. He stressed that he 
will keep his commitment to keep Mexican oil in the Mexican 
people's hands for our exclusive benefit until the very last day 
of his administration.

  [Text] The country's main political forces have reached an 
agreement for giving autonomy to the electoral bodies. It is an 
important reform that gives the people control in the decisions 
of the Federal Electoral Institute [IFE]. These are the 
proposals that will be voted during the special congressional 
sessions. 
  The PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], PAN [National 
Action Party], and the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] 
reached an agreement last night to reform the IFE and granted a 
majority to the people's participation. According to the 
proposal, which will be discussed next week during the special 
congressional sessions, the following will be the composition of 
the body as agreed upon by the country's three main political 
forces . 
  The political parties have 10 votes: four from the PRI, two 
from PAN, and one each from the PRD, PPS [Popular Socialist 
Party], PARM [Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution], and 
the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party; this 
represents 47.6 percent of the total. 
  With the reform, there will be one representative from each 
party, with a right of verbal participation but not to vote. 
The people's participation includes six magistrate-advisers, 
who must be lawyers, with a total of six votes, representing 
28.6 percent of the total. 
  The reform proposed the participation of six 
citizen-advisers, without any professional requirements, who 
must be elected by a congressional two-thirds majority and with 
six votes, representing 54.5 percent of the total. 
  The legislative branch participates with four votes, two 
deputies and two senators who represent 19 percent of the total. 
With the reform, they would have the same four votes, two 
deputies and two senators, who would now represent 36.4 percent 
of the total. 
  The president of IFE--that is, the government secretary--has 
one vote, with a right to break a tie and representation for 4.8 
percent of the total. With the reform, that official will 
continue to have one vote but without a right to break a tie and 
with a participation of 9.1 percent of the total. 
  Presently the IFE composition represents 21 votes; with the 
reform it would represent 11 votes. In this manner, the major 
weight of the decisions would be delegated to the 
representatives of society.

  [Text] The National Congress Permanent Commission summoned 
today an extraordinary session period to begin on 22 March. The 
commission plenum approved the motion with 26 votes in favor of 
and two against. The sessions will be held to discuss electoral 
reforms to the constitutional and penal codes. 
  The Popular Socialist Party [PPS] and the Cardenist Front 
for 
National Reconstruction Party [PFCRN] voted against the move. 
PPS Deputy Cuauhtemoc Amezcua criticized the fact only specific 
government officials and the Institutional Revolutionary Party 
[PRI], National Action Party [PAN], and the Party of the 
Democratic Revolution [PRD] participated in the negotiations 
regarding the extraordinary debates. PFCRN Deputy Alberto 
Carrillo said the people's participation in the Federal 
Electoral Institute will only create a council of notables; it 
will not guarantee or solve the electoral problems. 
  The summons states the special debates will begin on 22 
March 
but does not set an ending date. The document also establishes 
only two issues will be discussed and approved: 1) reforms to 
Article 41 of the Constitution, to allow greater citizen 
participation in the electoral organizations; and 2) reforms to 
the Penal Code to review the description of electoral crimes and 
to increase punishment. 
  The proposal to reform the penal code, both for general 
rights within the Federal District and federal rights for the 
rest of the country, suggests adding 17 acts to the current list 
of electoral crimes. This seeks to clearly and definitively 
protect the right to vote freely and privately, the right to 
participate in the political process, the authenticity of 
electoral documents, and to prevent the illegal use of public 
resources in favor of a specific political party or candidate. 
  Some of the more noteworthy acts to be listed as electoral 
crimes are: 
  1. Requesting votes in exchange for payment, gratification, 
or a promise of payment or gratification. 
  2. Those ministers of religious organizations who, during 
acts of their ministry, influence their followers to vote for or 
against a specific candidate or political party or to abstain 
altogether, will be sentenced to 500 days in jail or an 
equivalent fine. 
  3. Altering election results and removing or destroying 
ballots or electoral documents. 
  4. Disseminating false information regarding the election 
process or its results. 
  5. Forcing subordinate government employees to vote in 
favor of a specific political party or candidate; 
  6. Conditioning the rendering of public services or the 
completion of plans or projects in order to force voters to vote 
for a specific political party or candidate. 
  7. For public officials to use government funds, assets, 
or services assigned to them due to the nature of their position 
to support a political party or candidate or to do so using 
subordinate personnel during working hours, notwithstanding any 
other penalties that could derive from charges of embezzlement; 
those assets may include vehicles, buildings, and equipment, and 
there will be no bail for those detained on such charges. 
  8. Altering voter registration lists and tally sheets or 
issuing illegal voting credentials; such crimes shall be 
punished with three to seven years in prison. 
  Legislators from all parties expressed their opinion during 
the Permanent Congressional Commission's debate.

<F P=106> [Article by R.E. Arroyo and C. Raygoza] </F>
  [Text] The Mexpetrol S.A. Group is on the verge of 
purchasing a refinery located in Cuba's Cienfuegos Province, 
sources close to the negotiations told the FINANCIAL SATELLITE 
NEWS SERVICE (FINSAT). 
  Mexpetrol authorities have declined to comment on the report 
and have referred questions on the matter to Mexican Petroleum 
(Pemex), which owns 25 percent of Mexpetrol's stock. In turn, 
the Pemex public relations office would only say: "This is a 
sensitive issue, and we have been instructed to deal with it 
cautiously." 
  Meanwhile, National Foreign Trade Bank (Bancomex) officials 
said: "Cuba and business Mexico conducts with the Caribbean 
island are sensitive issues in light of our country's current 
relations with the United States." Bancomex is another 
government partner of Mexpetrol, holding 5 percent of Mexpetrol 
stock. 
  According to information supplied by officials familiar with 
the negotiations who requested anonymity, "one of the stumbling 
blocks to concluding the talks is that the Cuban authorities are 
asking a very high price for some installations that have 
obsolete technology"; these officials refused to give specific 
amounts. 
  The refinery in question has a 60,000 barrel per day [bpd] 
heavy crude processing capacity, which is similar to the 
capacity of Pemex's Maya refinery. Industry sources place its 
value between $15 and $200 million [figures as published]. 
  The U.S. publication "The Latin American Energy Alert" which 
circulates in North America has disclosed that Mexpetrol 
authorities met with Cuban authorities in Havana in February to 
discuss the possible purchase. It appears the refinery 
currently operates at half of its installed capacity by 
producing 60,000 bpd [as published]. According to the 
publication, the Cuban Government will sell the Cienfuegos 
refinery in exchange for Mexpetrol's promise to release part of 
the refined production to the island for internal use. Once 
refined, the remaining crude would be exported and marketed in 
Mexico. 
  The Cienfuegos refinery was designed with Soviet technology. 
It previously processed Venezuelan crude when Venezuela sold 
its products to the then-Soviet Union, and from this fact it is 
assumed heavy crude will continue to be processed at the 
refinery. 
  Currently, Pemex hold 25 percent of Mexpetrol's stock while 
Bancomex and the Mexican Petroleum Institue hold 5 percent 
apiece. The rest of the stock is held by the Mexican 
construction companies Protexa, Bufete Industrial, Ingenieros 
Civiles Asociados, and Equipo Petroleros Nacionales. Up until 
last year the Lanzagorta group held 13 percent of Mexpetrol 
stock, but at the beginning of 1993 it sold its holdings and 
withdrew from the company. Before now, this has never been 
officially reported.

  [Text] Reynosa, 18 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Foreigners who wish to 
travel through Mexico to other countries as migrants will only 
be able to enter the country at customs stations in Colombia, 
Nuevo Leon and Lucio Blanco-Los Indios de Matamoros, Tamaulipas 
beginning next Monday. 
  In a communique issued by the Mexican Consulate in McAllen, 
Texas, the Mexican Finance and Public Credit Secretariat (SHCP) 
said this measure had been agreed upon to avoid the jams that 
have occurred at the Reynosa and Matamoros, Tamaulipas custom 
stations. The document explained that they are trying to ease 
and control the international movement of people and merchandise 
from the United States to Central American countries through 
Mexican territory. 
  Based on Article 116 paragraph one of the Customs Law, 
foreigners who want to enter Mexico at border points between 
Acuna, Coahuila and Matamoros, Tamaulipas will be able to do so 
at the previously mentioned customs stations. 
  The SHCP also said the Lucio Blanco-Los Indios crossing is 
part of the Matamoros Customs Office and the facilities at the 
Colombia, Nuevo Leon Customs Office are adequate and are open 24 
hours a day. 
  The communique said that once foreigners are given migrant 
status, they can take their equipment with them but they will 
have to request a 10-day temporary permit for the vehicle they 
are travelling in. It added that people interested in moving 
merchandise through Mexico should consult a customs agent, who 
will take care of the necessary procedures at both customs 
offices.

eliminations for sensitive agricultural products negotiated 
under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to the 118 
member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT). 
  Custom tariffs will remain greater for products such as 
fresh 
cheese, grapes, coffee, wheat, and cigarettes than those agreed 
upon at the multilateral level, a policy which is intended to 
protect national industry. 
  Sources close to the Commerce and Industrial Development 
Secretariat (Secofi) have said despite the commitments decided 
during the Uruguay Round of agreements, there will be no 
negative impact on the Mexican agricultural sector, because 
nearly 80 percent of the trade in this area is with the United 
States and Canada. 
  The Uruguay Round of negotiations, which concluded on 15 
December, were incorporated into the text of the Free Trade 
Agreement between Mexico, the United States, and Canada. 
  Experts on the issue have said despite the fact the 
multilateral negotiations were less in-depth than the ones that 
took place at the trilateral level, Mexico had to compromise on 
deregulating agricultural products included in NAFTA. This 
means as of 1 January 1995, when the World Trade Organization 
(WTO) [Organization Mundial de Commercio] is scheduled to become 
effective, any of the 118 GATT member countries will be able to 
export sensitive agricultural products to Mexico if they decide 
to pay the custom tariffs. 
  Goods which for years were protected as part of the 
country's 
national development strategy and are now open to international 
trade include: corn, beans, malt, barley, poultry, turkey, 
animal fat, and potatoes. The negotiated tarrifs, despite 
Mexico's opposition to tax sensitive products, fluctuates 
between a minimum of 128 percent for barley and 282 percent for 
animal fat. 
  The only agricultural products for which Secofi negotiators 
were able to ensure tariffs greater than those granted to the 
United States and Canada as part of the NAFTA agreements 
include: fresh cheese, with 139 percent, which in NAFTA was 
downgraded to 40 percent; grapes, 50 percent, up from 20 percent 
in NAFTA; coffee, with 80 percent, up from 20 percent in the 
free trade agreement; wheat, 74 percent, up from 15 percent 
during the trilateral agreement; and cigarettes, 75 percent, up 
from 50 percent during the trade pact. 
  This means implementation of noncustom tariff barriers 
despite Mexico's opposition along with Canada, Korea [north or 
south not specified], and Japan. In exchange, Mexico was able 
to incorporate all NAFTA agricultural quotas as part of its 
commitments with GATT. 
  The reduction in agricultural products, which will allow an 
increase in agricultural exports from third countries to Mexico, 
are not expected to hamper national industry, because the basis 
for trade transactions will take place as per consolidated 
tarrifs, not according to applied tariff levels. Mexico has 
consolidated tariff totals by 50 percent, while applied tariff 
levels fluctuate between 10 and 20 percent. 
  According to GATT estimates, world trade between 1985 to 
2000 
is forecasted to grow by 12.4 percent, an estimated increase in 
the world's annual gross national product totaling $230 billion. 
  Mexico negotiated the Uruguay Round as part of a bloc of 
developing countries, although individually was able to ensure 
agricultural tariff concessions from Switzerland, Australia, the 
Soviet Union, Japan and the Nordic countries. 
  Switzerland decreased its importation of Mexican products 
such as natural honey, melons, papayas, avocados, skins of 
citrus fruits, and cotton by more than 36 percent. 
  Australia cut its importations of frozen strawberries, 
frozen 
orange juice, rum, and taffia by more than 20 percent. 
  On average, the European Union decreased its importation of 
goods such as natural honey, coffee, tobacco, avocados, 
safflower oil, guava jelly, mangoes, frozen broccoli, horse 
meat, roses, gladiolus flowers, carnations, frozen orange juice, 
pineapples, papaya, and mushrooms by 31 percent. 
  Secofi sources believe Mexico is in a position to increase 
its international market share in sectors that have definite 
competitive advantages such as textiles, garments, agricultural, 
food, and beverage products.

<F P=106> [News conference by magistrates of the Salvadoran Supreme </F>
Electoral Tribunal, TSE, from the Presidente Hotel in San 
Salvador -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [TSE President Luis Arturo Zaldivar Romero] 
Mr. President of the Republic; Messrs. members of the 
diplomatic corps; Messrs. visiting observers and personalities; 
Messrs. of the media; ladies and gentlemen: 
  On this glorious 20 March, we are concluding a vital process 
for the life of our beloved El Salvador. The Salvadoran TSE, 
for the past two years and plus days since it was installed, 
after being born to the country's juridical life as a result of 
the constitutional reforms stemming from the peace agreements 
about which we all know, has worked very arduously to reach this 
day when we, the TSE magistrates and all the personnel working 
in it, feel very pleased. We feel very pleased for having 
delivered to our country, because we have worked arduously in a 
clean and honest effort to ensure the obtained results are also 
the result of a free and just election, very clean and honest. 
  Your presence reaffirms, based on the expressions we heard 
on 
this day, that we did things well, that we did not fail our 
homeland. Behind that backdrop, we will proceed in this plain 
but solemn ceremony for our country's life, because we think 
this 20 March will go down in the history of not only El 
Salvador or America but of the entire world, because we want to 
be an example for the world. 
  To not tire you, we will proceed with the core of this 
ceremony. We will start to give results shortly of the various 
vote count certificates of the Voting Table Boards and a few of 
the Municipal Electoral Boards that we are receiving. 
  I know we are all impatient to learn about those results. 
They will arrive. Let's wait for a moment to allow the company 
that specializes in computer sciences which we have hired to 
develop what we all want to see through the computer program; in 
fact, this will be the reflection of the verdict of the 
Salvadoran people. This will install the authorities who 
managed to win the Salvadorans' will and trust to consolidate 
democracy in our country and the much- longed for peace which we 
know has arrived for all Salvadorans. Thank you very much. 
[applause] [passage omitted] 
  The following are the results after the votes cast at 870 
Voting Table Boards, the equivalent of 12.45 percent of the 
total vote, were counted and processed: ARENA [Nationalist 
Republican Alliance]--91,069 votes; the Coalition [Democratic 
Convergence-Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]--51,039 
votes; MAC [Authentic Christian Movement]--1,111 votes; the 
Unity Movement-- 4,248 votes; the National Solidarity 
Movement--1,471 votes; the PCN [National Conciliation 
Party]--6,574 votes; and the PDC [Christian Democratic 
Party]--22,282 votes. Total valid votes: 177,794.

  [Text] San Salvador, 20 Mar (ACAN) -- Ruben Zamora, 
presidential candidate of the Salvadoran left, has said there 
will be runoff presidential elections, and he rejected the 
ruling ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] party has won the 
elections. 
  Zamora has added there were serious irregularities, as 
former 
guerrilla commanders reported earlier, that prevented thousands 
of people from casting their votes. He has vowed these 
irregularities will not happen again in the runoff elections, 
which he expects to win with the support of other opposition 
forces.

  [Text] The Honduran Armed Forces said they would accept a 
budget reduction, an eventual privatization of Hondutel 
[Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise], and any other 
presidential initiative, but they also clearly established their 
opposition to an all-voluntary military service. 
  General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir acknowledged that health 
and 
education are priorities and expressed the Armed Forces' 
willingness to support President Reina's decision to implement 
the social assistance program he promised the Honduran people. 
  The planned 10-percent reduction of the Armed Forces' 270 
million lempira budget represents a 27 million-lempira cut 
which, according to Discua Elvir, will negatively affect the 
military's community programs. 
  Right now the military is engaged in assistance programs to 
improve education, environmental protection, and health, which 
includes the vaccination of the canine population. 
  Regarding an eventual privatization of Hondutel, the 
military 
chief said: "This is a profitable enterprise that has been very 
good for the government. Any eventual privatization should be 
carefully analyzed." The Armed Forces, however, acknowledge 
that "the final decision rests with the executive branch." 
  Discua Elvir announced that he will ask the Comptroller 
General's Office to audit the offices managed by the Armed 
Forces, something that has been done since 1990. 
  The military commander reiterated his opposition to military 
service becoming an all-volunteer institution because he 
believes it would be the end of the Armed Forces. 
  Gen. Discua is of the opinion that military service must be 
"constitutional and educational" (obligatory), but a 
presidential promise describes it as "voluntary and educational." 
  On this point, as on others, the military chief concedes 
that 
the final decision is in the hands of the president of Honduras.

<F P=106> [From the "Six o'Clock Sharp" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Nicaraguan international law specialists believe the 
current border situation with Costa Rica, where local 
landholders are invading part of Nicaragua, is extremely 
serious, and that the government must immediately and thoroughly 
act to clarify once and for all the sovereignty of their 
homeland along the border, including the San Juan River. 
  The Foreign Ministry pointed out that the Sandinist National 
Liberation Front is directly responsible for the current border 
situation because during the war it displaced the peasants and 
shopkeepers from the area and even mined part of it. Therefore, 
Nicaraguans moved to the other side of the border, to Costa 
Rica, where they helped to develop Costa Rica. After that, the 
Sandinists completely ignored the strip between boundary posts 
13 and 14, almost 30 km, which was abandoned. Nicaragua has 
warned Costa Rica that if it does not pay attention to marking 
out the area, it would unilaterally do so next April.

<F P=106> ["Challenge 94" election interview program with guests </F>
Ernesto Perez Balladares, PRD presidential candidate; Tomas 
Altamirano Duque, PRD candidate for first vice president; Felipe 
Virzi, PRD candidate for second vice president; and "Challenge 
94" program host Dorita de Reyna] 
  [Excerpts] [De Reyna] As promised, our guests today are the 
members of the United People presidential slate, grouping the 
Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD], Pala [Labor Party], and 
the Liberal Republican Party. These three parties have 
nominated Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares for president, Tomas 
Altamirano Duque for first vice president, and Felipe Virzi for 
second vice president. Welcome to "Challenge 94" 
  [Perez Balladares] Thank you. [Passage omitted] 
  [De Reyna] You have recognized that although in 21 years [of 
military regime] there were many achievements, 21 years is a 
long time. Besides, governing with absolute power and heavy 
financing makes it possible to achieve many things. 
  [Perez Balladares] I don't think it was during those 21 
years 
that many things were achieved. When I speak this way, I am 
referring to the time I participated, basically from 1976 to 
1982. At that time, we indeed had good conditions to obtain 
financing. With a little imagination, new alternatives, it is 
also possible to provide solutions without necessarily having 
the financial flows we had at that time. 
  [De Reyna] Let us talk of the 1976-1982 period. Errors were 
made at that time. Do you admit this? 
  [Perez Balladares] Of course. 
  [De Reyna] Which one? 
  [Perez Balladares] We must admit many errors from that 
period, as well as from other periods, the current period. Only 
a person who does nothing makes no mistakes. 
  [De Reyna] There are errors that are committed so often.... 
  [Perez Balladares, interrupting] Name one. 
  [De Reyna] Squandering of money, corruption.... 
  [Perez Balladares, interrupting] Those are objective errors, 
I mean subjective. You are giving a subjective opinion. Name 
one specific objective error. 
  [De Reyna] Human rights violations. 
  [Perez Balladares] Which ones? 
  [De Reyna] There are lists, even murders. 
  [Perez Balladares] Again, this is subjective. If you say, 
such and such person was killed, and it has been proven that 
that person was killed, I can answer. 
  [De Reyna] It just so happens that whatever happened during 
that period cannot be properly investigated. Do you agree or 
not? 
  [Perez Balladares] Well, I think these things have not been 
properly investigated in these past four or five years. There 
has been so much talk of all the monstrosity and things that 
happened, and why is it that nobody has been convicted, or why 
is it that nobody is guilty? Of course, I am excluding those 
cases that have gone to trial, and that we also reject. 
  [De Reyna] You have touched on a point that brings to mind 
the topic of the problem of justice. We have a serious problem 
with justice, and it is not a recent development. This has been 
happening for many years. How do you plan to resolve it? 
  [Perez Balladares] That is true, the problem is very serious 
and goes back many years. I believe the problem has its 
origin.... [pauses] pardon my ignorance, I am simply an 
economist and not a lawyer. I believe the problem originates 
within the Attorney General's Office, which to my way of 
thinking is where investigations could be handled with greater 
justice and honesty. Thus one of the things I propose is that we 
have a totally independent attorney general, someone whose 
credibility and respect is acceptable by all citizens in order 
for his investigations and positions to be perfectly honorable 
and acceptable. [passage omitted] 
  [De Reyna] Let us talk a little more about the people who 
surround you. 
  [Perez Balladares] You have my two vice presidents here with 
you. 
  [De Reyna] Yes of course, but I am referring to the other 
people around you. It is being said that you are hiding some 
people who are very close to you, who are your advisers. Is that 
true? 
  [Perez Balladares] [laughs] Look, Dorita, I have heard that 
story so much that it really makes me laugh. Let me tell you 
something. There are 154,000 members in my party. Those people 
-- to whom you are referring -- are names that unfortunately 
were demonized because they did dishonest things at certain 
times, because they were quoted out of context many times, 
because they were demonized by the media, or because they did 
dishonest things. That group is less than 20 people. If you make 
a list and you get more than 20 people, believe me, I will give 
you a prize. There are 154,000 persons in my party. That is not 
the problem as they are not my advisers. Evidently, when one 
engages in a political campaign, when one belongs to a party 
that tries to be democratic, I cannot become judge and jury and 
tell these people: You can be next to me or you may not. The 
internal democracy must be... 
  [De Reyna, interrupting] Yes, Dr. Perez Balladares, but you 
accept that you have 20 people... 
  [Perez Balladares, interrupting] I am not accepting that. I 
told you they are names of people who have been demonized. 
Nonetheless, there are candidates... 
  [De Reyna, interrupting] You said they did dishonest things 
in the past... 
  [Perez Balladares, interrupting] Some of them did and others 
did not... 
  [De Reyna, interrupting] Pardon me, let me ask you a 
question. How can you control people like that, once you reach 
the presidency? 
  [Perez Balladares] The same way I have done it... 
  [De Reyna, interrupting] Then, that means you do have 
them... 
  [Perez Balladares, interrupting] Look, right now, they are 
not playing any special role. I cannot kick them out of the 
party, however, unless they have done something serious. They 
have every right to nominate themselves for office, to be 
members of the party. In the long run, the party's internal 
democracy will decide if they can or cannot be party leaders, or 
if the party can nominated them. [passage omitted] 
  [De Reyna] Now, we would like to talk with the vice 
presidential candidates. Even though the Constitution does not 
assign specific functions to the vice presidents, the country 
has a certain degree of expectations regarding the vice 
presidential candidates accompanying the presidential 
candidates. Mr. Altamirano, you have held public offices in the 
past. You were the director of the National Sports Institute 
[Inde], is that right? 
  [Altamirano] That is correct. I was also housing minister. 
  [De Reyna] You were housing minister as well as public works 
minister. There are many claims you squandered money, were 
corrupt, stole, can you say something about that? 
  [Altamirano] About claims of squandering money and thefts? 
  [Reyna] That is correct. 
  [Altamirano] Look, I donated my Inde salary for 4 years. 
That 
money was used to build eight electric pylons in the interior of 
the Republic, and now they now have electricity thanks to that 
donation.... 
  [Perez Balladares, interrupting] You mean the pylons at 
eight 
stadiums, right? 
  [Altamirano] Yes, at eight stadiums... [pauses] six 
stadiums. 
  [Perez Balladares] You built the pylons at six stadiums with 
the donation of your salary, right? 
  [Altamirano] That is correct. Today, I am being accused of 
other charges. This is slander and defamation. It is said I 
stole $8,000 worth of PVC pipes... [pauses] $6,000 in PVC pipes. 
Who is going to steal $6,000 worth of PVC pipes after donating 
that amount of money? Of course, this is no excuse. Actually, 
those charges are ridiculous. The public works minister at the 
time, a Mr. Orillac, sent some people to my farm to investigate 
a bulldozer I had. 
  [De Reyna] You are referring to Minister Orillac of the 
Endara Government? 
  [Altamirano] I am referring to Rene Orillac who sent people 
to inquire about a bulldozer my grandfather purchased for 
$23,000 from Cardoze and Lindo. That bulldozer is over 30 years 
old. [passage omitted] 
  [De Reyna] Mr. Virzi: Since you are an expert in the 
agricultural sector, I would like to ask you what your 
recommendation for the government program is inasmuch as the 
agricultural sector cannot compete in an economic opening. 
  [Virzi] As Dr. Perez Balladares has said, my responsibility 
on this ticket is the agricultural sector. 
  [De Reyna] What do you recommend for improving the 
agricultural sector in Panama, for example? 
  [Virzi] Highways, roads; low-cost highways because of 
financing. More than anything else, highways because that is 
what worries us. [passage omitted] 
  [De Reyna] Mr. Perez Balladares, what is your opinion? 
  [Perez Balladares] You began by talking about the economic 
opening. Let us focus our discussion on that. There has to be an 
economic opening, and he agrees with that. We cannot have an 
economic opening at the cost of ruining the agricultural sector 
however. We cannot bankrupt all farmers so they will move to the 
capital city. Some agricultural products -- and I will mention 
some: rice, corn, beans, potatoes, onions, and others -- must be 
protected, but not necessarily subsidized. They cannot compete 
freely. Then, there are other things that must be done, like 
Virzi has said. For example, there must be production highways. 
For example, the cost of some of these products in the national 
market is high because it is so difficult to transport them from 
the fields. The other aspect is the financial aspect Virzi 
mentioned. The Agricultural Development Bank no longer lends 
money to the farmers or it lends money to those farmers who do 
not need it. 
  [De Reyna] Have you already prepared a program for that? 
  [Perez Balladares] Of course. [passage omitted] 
  [De Reyna] Dr. Perez Balladares: People wonder where you got 
your fortune. Do you have a fortune and can you explain where it 
came from? 
  [Perez Balladares] [laughs] Yes, of course. I am not a poor 
man, but I do not think I have a fortune per se. 
  [De Reyna] Are you worth several million [monetary unit not 
specified], for example? 
  [Perez Balladares] Yes, several million, of course. 
  [De Reyna] How many? 
  [Perez Balladares] I will leave that to your imagination. 
  [De Reyna] You are going to have to make a financial 
statement. 
  [Perez Balladares] Yes of course; I will make a statement in 
due time. Let me tell you something. Panamanian society has a 
problem, and it is a good idea to bring it up. Contrary to other 
countries where successful men are respected, emulated, and used 
as examples for society to imitate, here in Panama, 
unfortunately, successful men are the target of envy, usually by 
incompetent people. Therefore, people say the money is the 
result of theft. I will tell you something. I have the great 
fortune of having a father -- who is still alive -- and a mother 
who worked very hard and made money. I have been very lucky and 
I have made excellent investments. Right here, in front of you, 
I purchased a building with a $330,000 bank loan. 
  [De Reyna] Is that the building where the Ibero-American 
Bank 
is located? 
  [Perez Balladares] Part of the offices of Telemetro 
Television are located there. That building, which cost me 
$330,000 in 1974 when I was not part of the government, is now 
worth over $2 million. I have received offers for that building. 
What do you call that? 
  [De Reyna] Are you going to sell it? 
  [Perez Balladares] I will let you know when I am going to 
sell it. That is foresight, good luck. [passage omitted] 
  [De Reyna] Many people wonder what will you do with the 
military? Several times you have said the military will not 
return to power. The people continue to be concerned about that 
however. Some military, who are living abroad, have recently 
said they are just waiting for you to reach power in order to 
return to power. 
  [Perez Balladares] Those must be some pro-Carles military 
who 
want to hurt me. 
  [De Reyna] Yes? I want to ask you another question. You 
wanted to be a presidential candidate in 1984 as well as in 1989? 
  [Perez Balladares] Yes, in 1984, but not in 1989. In 1984, 
that is what caused me to be exiled. 
  [De Reyna] You have repeatedly said General Noriega did not 
let you become a candidate? 
  [Perez Balladares] Noriega, among others. There were several 
military men who prevented me from becoming a candidate. 
  [De Reyna] As you evaluate the past, do you think that was 
beneficial to you? 
  [Perez Balladares] Yes, of course. Looking back and seeing 
what happened to the person [Nicolas Ardito Barletta] who 
unfortunately replaced me, I think they would have had to kill 
me. I am not that type of man. The Lord knows why he did it. 
  [De Reyna] Thank you and good night. We thank our guests.

  [Text] U.S. Vice President Al Gore removed a coca-leaf 
necklace that had been placed in homage around his neck upon his 
arrival at the airport in La Paz, capital of Bolivia. The 
incident was interpreted by Bolivian radio as an inadmissable 
snub, a grave insult to Bolivia, because the coca leaf is 
considered an element of the national culture. 
  The U.S. vice president's attitude is due to Washington's 
position that the origin of the drug-addiction problem affecting 
U.S. society lies in the existence of the coca leaf. 
  The coca leaf has been consumed for centuries for beneficial 
purposes, but now the U.S. is trying to bring about the total 
elimination of the plant.

  [Text] In the Argentine city of Mar del Plata, Cuban Vice 
President Jose Ramon Fernandez has charged that the U.S. State 
Department has circulated threats against businessmen who intend 
to trade with Cuba. After calling the blockade the U.S. 
maintains against Cuba for over three decades criminal, 
Fernandez said that, despite those pressures, every day there 
are more and more foreign investors, particularly in tourism and 
petroleum exploration. Fernandez was attending a Panamerican 
Sports Organization meeting in Mar del Plata.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lucius Walker, head of the Pastors for Peace </F>
Movement, and Raul Suarez, president of the Martin Luther King, 
Jr., Memorial Center, by Roberto Cavada, Carlos Sanabria 
Marrero, and other Radio Rebelde reporters on the "Doing Radio" 
program on 18 March -- live, with passage by passage translation 
from English into Spanish and from Spanish into English by 
single translator; Walker transcribed from the English] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Sanabria] I wanted to know if 
we can expect another visit by you to Santiago de Cuba during 
the fourth caravan in November. 
  [Walker] [Esteban] Lazo was very clear that he had already 
made a democratic decision. He told the journalists to go away, 
and he said to Claridad [not further identified] and to Raul 
Suarez that he wanted to share something with them in a very 
democratic way, and then he said: The next caravan is going to 
Santiago de Cuba [in a loud voice and pounding on the desk]. 
[chuckles] Well, I think if you have ever seen and listened to 
Lazo, you will understand that no one disagrees with Lazo. So I 
think we must go back to Santiago. Besides, I have a key to the 
hotel. 
  [Sanabria] I am sure it would be good news for the people of 
Santiago de Cuba if the ship with the next donation would dock 
at the port of Santiago de Cuba as comrade Lazo has requested. 
What do you think? 
  [Walker] Well I think Raul Suarez is here. We should put him 
on the spot and let him answer that question. 
  [Suarez] Well, according to Lazo that is also possible. On 
our side, I do not think there would be any problems with that. 
Santiago de Cuba is a city that really deserves it. The people 
would get together to welcome the boat and to turn this event in 
a beautiful exhibition of the patriotic fervor which is typical 
of the people in Santiago de Cuba. 
  [Sanabria] I wanted to tell Reverend Suarez and Reverend 
Walker that I as well as the rest of the people in Santiago de 
Cuba am very enthusiastic about the news. I believe all the 
people in Santiago are hearing about this and feel very 
emotional that the fourth caravan of friendship by the Pastors 
for Peace will dock in Santiago de Cuba. 
  [Cavada] We want to thank our reporters Carlos Sanabria 
Marrero and Zenaida Costales. I just want to know when the 
pastors are leaving and when you return to the United States? 
  [Walker] On Saturday. 
  [Cavada] Do you have any scheduled meetings with Cuban 
President Fidel Castro? 
  [Walker] We have nothing scheduled, but we always have love 
for Fidel Castro in our hearts, and we know how terribly busy he 
must be. We will look forward to seeing him in November.

  [Text] Rocio Bernal, chief editor of Channel 7, has 
prepared an important report summarizing the main aspects of the 
meeting between Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and 
Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem in Buenos Aires: 
  [Begin Bernal recording] I have important news from 
Argentina. An important energy agreement was signed by President 
Sanchez de Lozada and Argentine President Carlos Menem. The main 
aspects of the agreement are the sale of 6.1 million cubic 
meters of natural gas per year at an initial price of $1.21 per 
cubic meters until 1996. As of 1996, the price will be increased 
annually based on international prices. For the first time 
Bolivia will sell gasoline to Argentina. This will allow Bolivia 
to obtain an income of $4 million a year. Regarding light crude 
oils, the cubic meter will be sold to Argentina at $162.50 
delivered at the Palmasola plant. 
  The official Bolivian mission that went to Argentina headed 
by President Sanchez de Lozada also was able to obtain an 
investment of $5 million for the next two years as of the 
agreement's signing. An investment of $15 million for the next 
four years also was obtained. The contract signed with Argentine 
Government Oil Deposits is an important step for the country's 
benefit, and from the quality and quantity viewpoint it is 
better than the previous contract. President Sanchez de Lozada 
expressed by phone his complete satisfaction with the result of 
his visit to Argentina because the No. 1 issue, the sale of 
natural gas to Argentina, was excellent for Bolivia after 
difficult negotiations. 
  Also, the presidents of Argentina and Bolivia reviewed 
international, regional, and bilateral issues within the 
framework of cordiality and friendship. They pointed out the 
excellent level of relations between the two governments, and 
verified the importance of the issues discussed during the 
recent visit of the Argentine foreign minister to Bolivia 
included in the La Paz Joint Declaration on 22 December 1993. 
  With the purpose of pointing out the positive results of the 
current visit, the presidents signed a joint declaration that 
says they reaffirmed their commitment to contribute to the 
consolidation of democracy in the continent as the essential 
basis for keeping peace and developing social justice to protect 
human rights and implement economic development. 
  The two presidents agreed that the invitation made by the 
four Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries to Bolivia 
to have government representatives participate as observers in 
the meetings of subgroups will contribute to strengthening the 
mechanisms of appropriate relations for joining the Mercosur 
integration process. 
  Regarding the Bolivian maritime claim, which is one of the 
main components of Bolivian foreign policy, the Bolivian 
president expressed his satisfaction over the possibilities now 
existing for sincere dialogue among all the parties involved. 
  The two presidents also expressed their conviction that the 
14th meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee of the 
Paraguay-Parana Waterway to be held in Formosa [Argentina] from 
21 to 25 March will strengthen cooperation between the states on 
the waterway program and will be progress in studying the 
related issues that will facilitate regional integration. 
  Within the framework of economic cooperation between the two 
governments, the Argentine Government gave Bolivia the 
equivalent of $84 million, of which $54 million is for local 
projects and will be disbursed from April to December. The 
remaining $30 million will be used to finance Argentine and 
Bolivian goods, installations, and equipment for a broad health 
program in the border regions of Argentina and Bolivia. To this 
effect, the two countries' health officials will prepare the 
adequate projects of basic infrastructure and health. Within 60 
days, a trade agreement will be signed establishing free 
transit, without tariffs or other types of fees, on goods 
between the two countries. This is for the competitive 
fabrication in Bolivia of products for the Argentine and 
Bolivian markets, for exporting to third countries, and for 
offering incentives for the investment of Argentine and Bolivian 
capital to this effect. The two presidents expressed their 
satisfaction with the signing of the agreement on reciprocal 
promotion and protection of investments. 
  Upon concluding his state visit, constitutional Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada thanked Argentine President 
Carlos Saul Menem for his expressions of sympathy and friendship 
and for the warm hospitality of the Argentine Government and 
people. [end recording]

  [Text] In a meeting with his DPRK counterpart Kim Pok-sin, 
Vice President Angel Seifart discussed the possibility of 
establishing trade relations with the DPRK and receiving 
technical assistance from that country. 
  Surprisingly, the meeting was held behind closed doors at a 
Febrerista Revolutionary Party office, after the meeting that 
should have been held at the Vice Presidency last week was 
canceled without explanation. Dr. Seifart said that the foreign 
minister had reminded Seifart that as vice president of the 
Republic, he could not receive the DPRK politician at the Vice 
Presidency because Paraguay does not have diplomatic relations 
with the DPRK. 
  It has been rumored, however, that the U.S. and ROK 
Embassies 
had strongly opposed the meeting. 
  "We want to be consistent with regard to our international 
policies. Until these two countries solve their unification 
problem we cannot risk harming the relations we have already 
established," Seifart explained. He thus tried to justify the 
position of the president of the Republic, who from the 
beginning said that his administration would not establish 
diplomatic relations "with any Communist country." 
  Seifart pointed out, however, that despite not having 
diplomatic relations with the DPRK, the government would not 
oppose having trade relations with that country.

  [Excerpts] A serious hope for disentangling the situation 
in Haiti has yet to emerge. After the series of congresses and 
conferences and the plan of the parliamentarians, political 
parties and groups are multiplying proposals aimed at lifting 
the country out of deadlock. The following is a report by Wilker 
Fecond: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Fecond] While the parliament 
is 
divided, plans are coming from everywhere. Proposals are being 
made to get Haiti out of the difficult deadlock it is 
experiencing today. Reactions continue to come from political 
parties and people's organizations, each perceiving the 
situation differently. 
  Reynold Georges, leader of Alliance for the Liberation and 
Progress of Haiti [ALAH], has reacted against the statement of 
the National Coalition [CN]. We remind you that the CN asked the 
Army to assume power so as to end the suffering and misery of 
the people. This statement has greatly shaken ALAH because it 
maintains its stance asking for the resignation of the head of 
the Army, which it considers the only way to resolve the crisis. 
[passage omitted] 
  In the same vein, Saint-Martin People's Movement [Mouvman 
Popile Senmaten, MPSM] says in a statement to Signal FM that the 
country's problem is not the matter of a plan, but rather is 
compliance with what was contained in the Governors Island 
agreement to facilitate the return of President Aristide to 
power. [passage omitted] 
  For its part, the Association of Young Haitian People's 
Power 
[Asosyasyon Jen Pouvwa Popile Ayisyen, AJEPOPOA] takes another 
stand, asking both President Aristide and General Cedras to step 
down. At the same time, the coordinator of this organization, 
Jude L. Jean-Jacques, has asked the Army to give the people a 
little leeway to go into the streets to demonstrate their 
discontent with all that is happening in the country. 
  [Jean-Jacques] Without doing anything wrong, in order and 
discipline, without disorder or looting, we will go into the 
streets as early as next week carrying our placards of demands 
to say no to Gen. Cedras, no to Father Aristide, yes to 
democracy, yes to a national solution, and yes to a responsible 
power working in the interests of the Haitian people. 
  [Fecond] This is how the situation is and many observers are 
wondering how long it will take Haiti to find a way to peace and 
reconciliation [and out of] the critical situation it is 
experiencing today. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The IMF Backs Fernando Henrique Cardoso"] </F>
  [Text] The official note issued on 16 March by IMF 
Managing General Michel Camdessus undoubtedly is a sign of great 
support for the Brazilian Government's economic program and, in 
turn, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. 
  The language of Camdessus' message is even surprising taking 
into account that the IMF was upset -- and rightly so -- because 
several Brazilian administrations failed to honor the terms of 
the agreements signed with this international organization. It 
was, therefore, only natural that the IMF receive with 
skepticism any promises coming from Brasilia to stabilize the 
country's economy. 
  Quite the opposite happened. The IMF, through its managing 
director, accepted promises that are easiest to measure, such as 
the promise that the operational deficit (including the interest 
on domestic and foreign debts) will be zero in 1994 and that 
there will be a primary surplus (without interest) of around 4 
percent of the GDP. The IMF also accepted the economic team's 
argument that the implementation of the URV [Real Value Unit] 
will do away with the "backward-looking" [preceding two words in 
English] indexation, that is, that takes past inflation into 
account. 
  Consequently, the IMF promises to work closely with 
Brazilian 
authorities to help the economic program launched on 28 February 
be successful "soon." But Camdessus has promised to extend this 
cooperation to the immediate future by promising a stand-by 
agreement or another way of close cooperation, for a start, when 
the new currency, the real, is put into circulation. 
  The IMF's green light paves the road for Brazil to reach an 
agreement with the private creditor banks that, in turn, will 
again make Brazil more attractive to investors. The terms of 
Camdessus' message are so categorical and even unusual that they 
sound almost as an invitation to invest in Brazil, which, as is 
obvious, will only contribute to the program's success. 
  Although, in its capacity as a technical organization, the 
IMF will not interfere in domestic political affairs, it is hard 
to ignore the political message contained in the note. The note 
undoubtedly represents a strong backing by the international 
financial community for the finance minister either for what is 
left of his mandate or, namely, a presidential candidacy.

now he is in Tuxtla Gutierrez and has all of the day's 
information, including statements by the governor of Chiapas. 
We will also discuss with him today's statements in the media 
by Subcommander Marcos of the Zapatist National Liberation Army 
[EZLN], who commented on the possible political aspirations of 
Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation 
in Chiapas. 
  Subcommander Marcos said Camacho Solis can, if he so 
desires, 
declare himself a presidential candidate, but Marcos warned that 
this would hurt his credibility. In addition, Marcos has sent 
Camacho Solis a message saying the EZLN is not willing to be 
used as a political stepping stone. Is that about it, Juan 
Carlos? 
  [Santoyo] Yes. Good evening everyone. Without a doubt, 
these statements by Subcommander Marcos show there is a certain 
degree of uneasiness in the negotiating process. We have 
reports that indicate the second round of internal EZLN 
negotiations are due to begin on Saturday or Sunday in the 
Lacandona jungle to decide the EZLN's reply to the government's 
proposal as presented by Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis 
during the first stage of the dialogue. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Havana, 15 Mar (PL) -- An unexpected summit of the 
Anglo-Caribbean community Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] held 
this weekend clearly established the Antillean countries' hope 
of joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), 
either as a bloc or separately. 
  The meeting, held on Saturday and Sunday in Kingston, 
capital 
of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and attended by 13 Caricom 
heads of state, focused its attention on ways to join the 
Canadian, U.S., and Mexican trade agreement. 
  For more than a year, Caricom has studied possible ways of 
joining NAFTA and also ways to keep the old Caribbean Basin 
Initiative (CBI) privileges sponsored by former President Ronald 
Reagan's administration in the 1980's. 
  CBI accorded certain Caribbean and Central American products 
tax free access to the U.S. market. The 12-year deadline 
stipulated by the CBI for its implementation, however, is about 
to end and the benefits are threatened by the competition of 
similar products manufactured in Mexico, a NAFTA partner. 
  The Kingston summit reached two conclusions. First, to 
officially ask U.S. Trade representative Mickey Kantor to report 
on Caricom's ability to join NAFTA, and second, to give Trinidad 
and Tobago and Jamaica the green light to negotiate their 
independent admission to the NAFTA. 
  The latter conclusion, which seems to be the result of an 
aggressive campaign by U.S. Ambassador in Trinidad Sally Cowall, 
somehow contradicts the group spirit which has prevailed in 
Caricom negotiations with the world since its creation in 1973. 
  The regional integration organization, although criticized 
for the slow implementation of its financial and commercial 
decisions, still maintains an unfailing unity among its members, 
and it has been the strength behind the Association of Caribbean 
States (CSA), whose constitution will begin to be drafted on 
Wednesday in Jamaica by a group of experts from the 38 potential 
members. 
  The special summit, just two days before the Kingston 
meeting, seems to indicate there are still unexplored areas in 
Caricom's plans for a mechanism that will tie their fragile 
insular economies to those of other more developed Caribbean 
countries, like Cuba, and the so-called medium Latin American 
powers like Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia. 
  The Caribbean people are truly facing a situation akin to 
panic given the danger of losing CBI benefits; Latin American 
banana producers' questions concerning their advantages -- 
earned through their colonial heritage -- in the British market; 
and the real threat of NAFTA, which will significantly undermine 
access of their products to the United States. 
  Nevertheless, history has shown the spirit of integration 
which prevails among the small Anglo-Antillean islands is deeply 
rooted and their leaders' unyielding resistance to Washington's 
pressure to exclude Cuba from the future CSA proves it. 
  The future organization, designed to coordinate 
intergovernment cooperation in trade, culture, education, and 
ecology, and to sponsor a future market among its members, 
should include 38 countries from the Caribbean insular, basin, 
and coastal areas with different degrees of development and 
political tendencies. 
  Stages of the project include preparing the constitution, 
which will be handled by experts gathered in Jamaica between 16 
and 18 March; the foreign ministers approving it while in 
Mexico; and the heads of state and government, who will formally 
comprise the CSA, signing it at the Caricom summit in July in 
Barbados. 
  Either way, NAFTA looms over any trade negotiation started 
by 
the CSA because it involves one of the member states -- Mexico 
-- and it significantly affects the other members. 
  Whether Caricom manages to join NAFTA as a group or Jamaica 
and Trinidad forge ahead on their own is still being studied, 
and that decision will surely set the prevailing trend in future 
trade negotiations between the CSA and the United States, which 
always prefers to negotiate bilaterally with the Caribbean 
people given the saying, "divide and conquer."

<F P=106> [Article by Marcelo Bonelli; all names as published] </F>
  [Text] Bill Clinton's Democratic administration is studying 
the demands submitted by 30 U.S. businesses asking for the 
immediate application of trade sanctions against Argentine 
manufacturers that export to the U.S. market. 
  The initiative is being evaluated by the U.S. trade 
representative, the influential and incisive Michael Kantor, who 
less than a week ago had a harsh and unusual conversation with 
President Carlos Menem. 
  The U.S. official is studying possible sanctions at the 
request of the powerful U.S. pharmaceutical industry due to the 
approval of the patents law here. 
  The demand presumably implies (if it succeeds) the setting 
of 
quotas, the elimination of preferential import systems, and 
tariffs for several Argentine manufactured goods that might 
include textiles, steel products, petrochemicals, and leather 
products. 
  The U.S. trade representative is precisely studying whether 
to term Argentina "a priority foreign country." 
  This in fact means the following: The Democratic 
administration's Commerce Department is beginning its evaluation 
to immediately apply every type of trade reprisal. 
  The request is contained in a confidential document CLARIN 
had exclusive access to. In the document, influential U.S. 
business people ask that Argentina be qualified an "offensive" 
nation on the question of trade because they believe Argentina 
is "resisting" the implementation of an adequate policy in the 
intellectual property field. Adequate, of course, for U.S. 
industry interests. 
  The two demands are really contradictory. Bilateral trade is 
frankly negative for Argentina. The deficit amounted to $2.4 
billion in 1993. 
  Despite all of this, the U.S. corporation known as the 
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association [title in English] 
(PMA), which was created to lobby [preceding word in English] 
for the powerful multinational laboratories, demands sanctions. 
  These are the words that are used in that secret paper 
[preceding word in English]: "In sum, we believe that the 
following four countries are so offensive in their practices, 
policies, and actions, and that they continue to resist efforts 
to improve their respective intellectual property measures that 
they do not merit being named as foreign priority countries: 
Argentina, Brazil, India, and Turkey." 
  The pharmaceutical industry of the north does not stop 
there, 
and it suggests the implementation of Resolution No. 301 with 
which the United States threatened Japan in the trade war 
declaration. 
  The letter is only signed by Gerald Mossinghoff, who holds 
the post of PMA head. It is exactly two pages long. A copy of 
the document is to be found in the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires. 
  This is not a secret to the government. CLARIN also has been 
able to detect the presence here of three PMA representatives. 
  They have been here since 15 March. They have contacted top 
members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies. Between today 
and 17 March they will hold meetings at the Foreign and Economy 
Ministries. 
  They are three PMA heavyweights -- Warren Wells, vice 
president for Latin America, and directors Lesly Ackerman and 
Bruce McPhil. 
  These businessmen also are demanding a total ban against 
Argentina's access to the common market formed by the United 
States, Canada, and Mexico. 
  The document states precisely: "Other Latin American 
countries have expressed their wish for access to NAFTA. The 
PMA believes that even before negotiations for this access 
begins, the U.S. trade representative must be sure that the 
region's national laws on patents must comply with NAFTA's 
standards regarding intellectual property." 
  In this case Argentina will remain out of NAFTA. Or, at 
least it will not figure in the first list of countries that 
Clinton will make known in May. 
  The PMA groups 30 large multinational enterprises. It 
invoices $70 billion a year, which is the exact equivalent of 
one-third of Argentina's GDP. 
  On 11 March, Kantor himself, in a surprise move, told Menem 
that Argentina must approve a new law on pharmaceutical patents 
within 45 days. Government House insists that Kantor's attitude 
and language were a discourtesy toward Menem. 
  And they really do not know what to do. They are willing to 
negotiate. Argentina wants something conclusive in exchange, 
but there are doubts whether it will be possible.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "New Banking Competitiveness Rules"] </F>
  [Text] An administration decree has repealed articles in 
the financial institutions law and empowered the Central Bank to 
authorize the operations of foreign banks without requiring 
reciprocity from their home countries. The classification of 
banks by source of capital has also been abolished. This move, 
which is already the subject of intense controversy, is 
ultimately designed to reduce interest rates and the cost of 
financial services in general. 
  We should indicate, first of all, that a law has been 
amended 
by decree, a by now all too common occurrence that has become 
one of the most striking maladies of the institutional system. 
In essence, though, it represents a unilateral opening of the 
Argentine economy, in keeping with the decision about foreign 
trade. Indeed, the series of decisions that cut tariffs 
substantially and abolished other restrictions on imports of all 
sorts of merchandise were equally unilateral. 
  A different approach in both instances would have been to 
seek reciprocity from other nations. But the feeling was that 
unilateral liberalization was indispensable to promote 
competition and enhance the productivity of the Argentine 
economy. Since a liberalization negotiated on condition of 
reciprocity would have taken years perhaps, with no guarantee of 
success, the decision was made unilaterally, to further the 
country's own interests. 
  At the same time, though, a cut in Argentine tariffs, with 
reciprocity, was negotiated during the Uruguay Round of GATT. 
Once the negotiations are approved, these tariffs cannot exceed 
35 percent. This means that our country can raise them to that 
"ceiling" if it ever considers such a move appropriate. 
  In the case of banks we are talking about services, not 
goods. This sphere of economic activity is rapidly becoming part 
of international commerce, as has just been acknowledged during 
the negotiations in the Uruguay Round of GATT, which created an 
institutional framework parallel to trade in goods. In this case 
tariffs cannot be applied. Liberalization means the right to do 
business and to receive the same treatment accorded the services 
delivered by domestic firms. This is precisely what the decree 
in question is about. 
  The administration has thus chosen to apply to banking the 
same principle of unilateral liberalization that it decided to 
apply at the time to trade in goods. 
  The goal of the economic authorities is to stimulate 
competition among banks, as a result of which it expects a drop 
in interest rates and in the cost of financial services in 
general, which has been a constant demand of agriculture, 
industry, and in particular, small and mid-sized businesses in 
the interior. 
  The principle of reciprocity is very common in the 
legislation of major nations. In Argentina's case, however, it 
has not yielded significant results, to judge by the delays and 
inaction on various requests by Argentine banks to open branches 
in major financial centers. The primary explanation of this is 
our country's relatively minor financial bargaining power in the 
world. 
  Other, more powerful nations have a better chance of success 
in applying this principle, for example the United States in its 
trade dispute with Japan. The economic authorities have no doubt 
observed the difficulties of reciprocity and, as a result, chose 
the potential advantages of financial competition. 
  The opening of the local market to foreign banks is largely 
a 
political issue. In past decades this would have been 
unthinkable, as was foreign involvement in other areas of the 
economy, especially those regarded as "strategic," such as 
energy, petroleum, gas, and railways. Current political, 
economic, and technological developments show that many economic 
and financial borders are being erased. 
  Foreign firms already have a major presence in the banking 
sector. So the liberalization will probably mean, above all, the 
opening of more branches of the foreign banks that are already 
here, which until now have been restricted from doing so. 
  The decision does not give free rein to establish all kinds 
of banks and branches, as this will in any event remain subject 
to the regulations and approval of the Central Bank. 
  A very important facet of the debate has to do with how much 
this decision will help to lower interest rates. A likely result 
is that competition will improve the productivity and efficiency 
of banks, regardless of how many domestic, foreign, and 
state-run banks are already in operation. 
  It is doubtful, however, whether the wide spread between 
bank 
interest rates on loans and on deposits is due mainly to the 
lack of competition. There are other, major factors, such as 
large reserve requirements, the many burdensome regulations and 
activities that the banks must endure by government mandate, and 
also, to some extent, the tax on financial transactions, which 
pays for the costly, bureaucratic system of social benefits for 
the sector, or labor legislation. Action will also have to be 
taken on this front in order to truly lower interest rates so 
that they cease to represent a drag on the competitiveness of 
Argentine producers.

  [Editorial Report] Buenos Aires CLARIN in Spanish, in its 
13 March issue, carries five copyrighted articles with charts 
totalling 2,500 words on pages 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving details of 
an exclusive poll carried out by the Center for Public Opinion 
Studies, CEOP. The results show that the Justicialist Party, PJ, 
is "comfortably" ahead of the Radical Civic Union, UCR, in the 
nationwide voters' preference for the national elections for 
Constituent Assembly members that will be held on 10 April. 
  The poll was carried out between 16 February and 8 March 
among 2,450 people in the largest voting districts of the 
Republic: the Federal Capital, Greater Buenos Aires, Buenos 
Aires Province, and in the cities of Cordoba, Mendoza, Rosario, 
Tucuman, Santiago del Estero, and La Banda in Santiago del 
Estero Province. 
  A 700-word article by Maria Seoane published on page 2 
states 
that, less than a month before the elections, 30.8 percent of 
the voters favor the PJ, and 16.8 favor the UCR. This 
difference is "overwhelming" in Buenos Aires Province where the 
list headed by Governor Eduardo Duhalde has 33.5 percent while 
that headed by Raul Alfonsin has 15 percent. In the Federal 
Capital the PJ list headed by Carlos Corach, the legal and 
technical secretary of the presidency, has 26.3 percent while 
the UCR list headed by Jesus Rodriguez has 16 percent. The 
results show that five out of 10 voters approve the PJ-UCR pact, 
while two out of 10 disapprove. The article points out the 
importance of a "landslide victory" by the PJ in Buenos Aires 
Province given that it is the district that will elect the most 
delegates which will give the PJ an absolute majority in the 
national Constituent Assembly. In third place in Buenos Aires 
Province comes Aldo Rico's Movement for Independence and 
Dignity, Modin, with 7.2 percent, followed by the Grand Front 
headed by Pino Solanas with 4.8 percent. 
  A 330-word unattributed article on page 3 comments on how 
the 
UCR has lost voters. It states that the UCR has lost half of 
those who voted for it in the last October elections. 
  The same page carries another 300-word unattributed article 
that states that the PJ in Buenos Aires Province is not the same 
as that of the times of Peron because now it is equally 
supported by the rich and poor. The middle class, the article 
states, continues to favor the UCR. In the same district, Modin 
mainly attracts former Peronists who are disenchanted with the 
current PJ. 
  A 400-word article by Mariana Garcia published on page 4 
describes the voters' preferences in the main polled cities. In 
Cordoba city the UCR runs slightly ahead of the PJ by 24.6 
percent to 24.5 percent, with the Democratic Centrist Union, 
Ucede, coming third with 5.5 percent. In Mendoza City the PJ 
leads with 37.9 percent, the UCR comes second with 16.6 percent, 
and third comes the Democratic Party with 3.4 percent. In 
Tucuman City, the PJ alliance has 34.3 percent, the Republican 
Force has 25.6 percent, and the UCR has 12.9 percent. In Santa 
Fe City and Rosario, the PJ has 28.3 percent, the UCR has 18.7 
percent, while the Socialist Union has 6.1 percent. In the 
cities of Santiago del Estero and La Banda, the UCR runs 
comfortably ahead of the PJ with 29.1 to 15.1 percent, with 
Modin in third place with 5.5 percent. 
  Finally, a 500-word unattributed article on pages 4 and 5 
states that five out of 10 Argentines -- some 11 million voters 
-- do not know what they are voting for in the upcoming 10 April 
elections. A breakdown of this figure shows that 30.4 percent 
have no idea what they are voting for; 13.9 percent think the 
elections are to reelect President Menem; 2.1 percent think the 
elections are to elect national deputies; 1.0 percent think they 
are to national senators; 1.1 percent gave other answers; and 
1.4 percent did not answer.

  [Text] Washington -- Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and 
Central Bank President Pedro Malam were surprised by the content 
of a note disseminated on 16 March by U.S. Treasury Under 
Secretary Larry Summers. The minister read the note where the 
Treasury said it would not issue a special zero-coupon bond 
series to sell to Brazil, but he did not believe it. He told a 
reporter: "This must be the wrong note." Pedro Borio, Brazilian 
Embassy press attache, who was already at home, was then 
mobilized to find the "real" note. But the real note ended up 
being the one the minister considered "wrong." 
  Two hours before, after his meeting with IMF officials, the 
minister had met with Summers and said he was optimistic that 
the IMF's delay in signing the stand-by agreement would not 
prevent the Treasury from selling the zero-coupon bonds to 
Brazil. 
  The major concern among government officials is that the 
Treasury note could be interpreted by the creditor banks 
committee as a signal to suspend the agreement to renegotiate 
the debt. The operation to purchase the zero-coupon bonds on the 
secondary market, which Brazil now will have to do, does not 
create excessive concerns. The Central Bank already has been 
making discreet purchases of these bonds through brokers.

  [Text] New York -- Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso on 17 March admitted that Brazil will use its 
international reserves to purchase U.S. Treasury bonds for a 
total of $2.8 billion. These bonds will be offered to creditor 
banks as guarantees during the exchange of old foreign debt 
bonds for new ones with better repayment conditions. Cardoso 
said Brazil is prepared to produce the necessary bonds to 
guarantee an agreement with creditor banks on 15 April. 
  William Rhodes, president of the Creditor Banks Advisory 
Committee and Citibank vice president, said at the end of his 
meeting with the minister that he will consult with the 
committee today, seeking to waive a clause in the agreement 
requiring the purchase of those bonds directly from the U.S. 
Treasury. He will also seek to do away with the requirement of 
an IMF stand-by agreement for the purchase of those bonds. 
  In a note distributed after the meeting, Rhodes said: "We 
are 
consulting with the committee seeking the approval of the 
necessary exemptions (waivers) in order to put together a 
package to finance the foreign debt on 15 April, as agreed. I 
trust tomorrow afternoon (today) at the latest, the committee 
will be ready to recommend the approval of the waivers to the 
international financial community." 
  Standing next to the minister in the Intercontinental 
Hotel's 
lobby, Rhodes said: "I trust the committee will maintain the 
agreement to renegotiate the debt." The minister admitted that 
the country has purchased, is purchasing, and will continue to 
purchase bonds to shore up the negotiations.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The PT [Workers Party] and the PSB 
[Brazilian Socialist Party] yesterday formed an alliance that 
will be ratified by the executive boards of the two parties. 
Party Presidents Luis Inacio Lula da Silva and Miguel Arraes 
met in Brasilia to debate the joint program of government. They 
defined their priority: the 70 million people who are being 
"ignored" by the Brazilian economy. 
  "We will work together to design the program and coordinate 
the political sectors during the campaign," Lula said. After 
this meeting Lula met with Roberto Freire, PPS [Popular 
Socialist Party] deputy for Pernambuco, and with Sergio Arouca, 
PPS deputy for Rio de Janeiro. At a national party convention 
held last Sunday, 12 PPS state boards voted to support the PT in 
the presidential elections. 
  At the meeting with the PSB Arraes raised the issue of the 
"ignored" sectors. Lula clarified that the PT draft government 
program advocates an economic policy that favors the lower 
income sectors. "Yet to support those who are oppressed is not 
sufficient. What is needed are concrete projects for solving the 
issue," said economist Maria da Conceicao Tavares, who attended 
the meeting between Lula and Arraes. 
  Three PSB names are being considered for vice president on 
Lula's ticket: Jose Paulo Bisol, senator for Rio Grande do Sul; 
ex-prefect Vilma Maia (Rio Grande do Norte); and Maceio Mayor 
Ronaldo Lessa. Lula and Arraes said that their agenda did not 
include this topic. 
  Late in the afternoon, Ronaldo Lessa contacted PT leaders to 
arrange a conversation with Lula. Lessa said that the PT has 
not made a formal commitment with the PSB because it must still 
negotiate with the PPS and the PC do B [Communist Party of 
Brazil]. He said the PSB position is "legitimate." "We are the 
largest among the allies. I am sure this is the major factor," 
Lessa said. In what is a favorable precedent, Lessa defeated 
then President Fernando Collor in the elections for the post of 
mayor of Maceio in 1992, in an unprecedented coalition between 
the PSB, PT (post of deputy mayor), PDT [Democratic Labor 
Party], PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], PPS, and PC do 
B.

  [Excerpt] An impasse over salaries between the National 
Research Council (CNPq) and a group of five civilian researchers 
scheduled to spend the winter in the frozen land of the 
Commander Ferraz Antarctic Station (EACF) may interrupt 
Brazilian research in the frozen continent for 10 months. The 
scientists want monthly payments of $5,500 (3.63 million real 
cruzeiros), which are equivalent to the salaries paid to 
military personnel, and the CNPq is offering $1,700 (1.2 million 
real cruzeiros). 
  The researchers refused to leave for Antarctica this week as 
scheduled for a 10-month period at the station, and just eight 
military officers supplying logistics support for the project 
traveled. According to Heber Reis Passos, the Trade Union of 
Federal Servants in the Science and Technology Area director, 
the problem started when the Navy Ministry, responsible for the 
entire project during its first eight years, disengaged itself 
from the research field, which was taken over by the Science and 
Technology Ministry last year. 
  Following this disengagement, the scientists began to 
collect 
their payments as per the CNPq payment schedule for people 
working abroad, while military personnel continued collecting 
their payments as per their ministry's payment schedule. Reis 
said: "When the researchers saw that they would not receive 
equal treatment, they refused to leave for Antarctica." 
  The EACF currently develops projects on the ozone layer, 
magnetism, pollution, cosmic rays, and meteorology, among 
others. Heber Reis believes the absence of scientists during the 
winter at the Antarctic station might mean an "irreparable 
hiatus" in the program. Reis said: "The country will lose 10 
months of research work, which is absurd." 
  CNPq Technological Development Superintendent Guilherme 
Brandao believes this threat does not exist. He emphasized that 
the CNPq has contacted researchers who already have been at the 
station before to replace those who refused to leave for 
Antarctica. With this, Brandao hopes to minimize the delay's 
consequences. He emphasized: "We probably will send a new 
group within three months on the next support flight." [passage

  [Text] Brasilia -- Alcatel, the world's largest 
manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, has won the $29 
million bidding organized by Telebras [Brazilian 
Telecommunications, Inc] for construction of the first data 
transmission and switching network in the country. The 
companies NEC, Ericsson, and STC (an association between the Sid 
company and the American giant AT&amp;T) were beaten during the 
technical requirements stage. Alcatel prices were 25 percent 
cheaper than those of its main adversary, the company Equitel, 
representing Siemens. 
  "The intelligent network is a new concept in communications 
networks and will represent a revolution in the automation of 
telephone services, which will become more agile and flexible," 
Telebras President Adyr da Silva said. "Strategically the 
victory constitutes an important bridge for the company, because 
it will superimpose a new network on the one already built by 
Telebras," Alcatel President Manuel Octavio Lopez said. 
  Lopez said the network will offer three new services in the 
first stage, besides permitting 20 million simultaneous calls, 
by installing access points to the systems installed in Rio de 
Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Brasilia, Salvador, and 
Curitiba. The number of simultaneous calls will climb to 60 
million when the system is completely installed. 
  The first benefit for consumers will be the possibility of 
using a new kind of 800 service (charge calls) which eliminates 
the need to call the long distance operator before calling the 
company number. The system also contemplates the installation 
of telephones that can be operated with credit cards. Users 
will be able to pass their credit cards through the machine, and 
the call will be automatically charged. The company also plans 
to install an Advanced Virtual Network that will operate as 
Telebras' voice channel, but with cheaper rates. In this case, 
large companies will be able to use a PABX [private automatic 
branch exchange] system for intercity calls. 
  According to the Alcatel president, the company has already 
agreed with Telebras to create a technological development group 
for the intelligent network, which will be based at the Research 
and Development Center (CPQD) owned by the state company in 
Campinas (SP) [Sao Paulo]. "It is not a partnership, but the 
means to create new services, and the network standards and 
testing during the system's installation will be the 
responsibility of both companies," CPQD Director Paulo Pospissil 
said.

  [Text] Senate approval of the inspection of Brazilian 
nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) puts the finishing touch on the effort by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and the Armed Forces to bring the country into 
the community of nations having access to nuclear technology 
while protecting the sovereign interests of national 
development. The decision ratifies commitments made by Brazilian 
diplomats and confirms that the national nuclear 
program--recognized as a leading sector in the progress of 
Brazilian industrial technology--is following rigorous 
parameters in complying with international safety standards. 
  Besides the Senate decision, a new level in relations 
between 
Brazil and Argentina has been reached thanks to establishment of 
the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of 
Nuclear Materials (ABACC). The result is that Brazilian 
diplomats now possess important trump cards for reversing 
Brazil's image as an unreliable country as far as transferring 
sensitive technology is concerned. 
  The subject of nuclear safeguards is complex and requires 
exhaustive international negotiations by Brazilian diplomats. 
Brazil has not signed and does not intend to sign the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which it considers 
discriminatory and unfair. It is, however, one of the few 
countries in the world whose Constitution includes a provision 
banning the manufacture of atomic bombs. Perhaps that 
constitutional provision is not regarded as a guarantee, but it 
shows our country's intention to use nuclear technology for 
peaceful purposes. 
  According to the text approved by the Senate, the enrichment 
of uranium will be inspected not from the standpoint of the way 
it is accomplished but in terms of the quantity produced. The 
Navy is thus honoring its pledge to keep uranium production at 
enrichment levels not exceeding 20 percent. Brazil is therefore 
providing the international community with a guarantee that its 
production of nuclear power is not aimed at the manufacture of 
an atomic bomb, which would require uranium enriched to much 
higher levels. And at the same time, the country is protecting 
the secrecy of the military program for building a 
nuclear-powered submarine, a program that is being carried out 
in an extremely efficient manner by the Navy at the Aramar 
Experimental Center in Ipero, Sao Paulo. 
  It should not be forgotten that nuclear power is currently a 
highly competitive international market. Indiscriminately 
divulging the stage reached in certain research could hinder the 
transfer of technology and the achievement of Brazilian 
production levels capable of threatening internationally 
established monopolies.

  [Text] Fortaleza -- Environment Minister Rubens Ricupero 
said on 9 March that the desertification problem in Brazil is 
more serious than the devastation in the Amazon region because 
it affects a larger number of people -- at least 18 million 
residents of northeastern Brazil. Ricupero recommended: 
"People sometimes get more emotional over the forest because it 
is more spectacular. We also want industrialized nations to 
give the same attention to arid and semi-arid areas." 
  Ricupero participated on 9 March in the opening ceremony of 
the Latin American Seminar on Desertification. The minister 
today will propose to Bo Kjellen, the Desertification Convention 
Negotiations Intergovernmental Committee chairman, to avoid 
implementing an approach "merely based on providing assistance" 
and provide support for the development of the population living 
in the areas affected by this problem. Ricupero noted: "Even 
though we admit that the priority is Africa, the most affected 
continent, we want the donating countries' commitment to Latin 
America to be mandatory." 
  According to Ricupero, overcoming desertification in Latin 
America will require expenditures totaling $2 billion. The 
minister said the outcome of the National Conference on 
Desertification, which ended on 9 March, will manifest to our 
country "a problem of which the people have thus far been 
unaware" and yield contributions for the National 
Antidesertification Program. Ricupero said: "We want to define 
this policy, which does not exist yet in either Brazil or most 
Latin American countries, with the exception of Mexico." 
Delegates from the interested countries have to draw up a 
proposal for Latin America by 11 March.

  [Text] La Paz, 18 Mar [date as received] (PL) -- Vice 
President Albert Gore's 12-hour flash visit to Bolivia was the 
subject of more expressions of rejection by the country's 
leading peasant and workers organizations. 
  Felix Santos, top leader of the Sole Peasant Workers 
Confederation of Bolivia (CSUTCB), condemned Gore's visit, 
because he believes the vice president is coming to press for 
the forced elimination of coca plantations and the complete 
privatization of the country's economy. 
  There is reason to fear he is coming to promote violence 
against peasants who grow coca, a leaf with natural benefits 
which is also used to produce cocaine, Santos added, referring 
to the growing tension between narcotics police and peasants 
over the last few weeks. The peasants are afraid the soldiers 
will come to flatten their crops. 
  Washington has conditioned its aid program of the Bolivian 
balance of payment, which totals $40 million per year, to the 
fulfillment of coca plantation reduction goals. 
  Toribio Hinojosa, secretary general of the Bolivian Workers 
Federation (COB) [Central Obrera Boliviana], has said the 
organization has decided to declare Al Gore's visit as non 
grata, adding the visit demonstrates U.S. concern over the 
peasants' determination to resist the elimination of the coca 
leaf. 
  The government and the coca leaf growers are on the verge of 
an agreement that conditions coca plantation reduction plans to 
the development of alternate activities to provide farmers with 
new means of survival, thus reducing tension. 
  During his stay in Bolivia, Gore will meet with Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and other national 
authorities, under strict security measures.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 20 Mar (PL) -- The 17-hour visit U.S. 
Vice President Al Gore will make to Argentina today has been 
ticketed as an expression of the "impeccable" bilateral ties 
between this country and the United States despite the strain 
that prevails in various top-priority fields of interest. 
  The White House's second most important man, who will be 
arriving from Bolivia this evening and will leave for Brazil 
tomorrow, will hold two meetings with Argentine President Carlos 
Menem and his advisers to examine the so-called Summit of the 
Americas, which is scheduled to take place in Miami, Florida, in 
December. 
  Gore has plans for tours to other regional countries in 
April. It was this statesman who, during his visit to Mexico in 
January proposed, on behalf of President Bill Clinton, the 
celebration of the hemispheric summit. According to officials 
preparing this conference, the Miami encounter will be the main 
issue of the conversations Gore will hold with his hosts. 
  The meetings in La Paz, Buenos Aires, and Brasilia will 
permit the U.S. Government leader to return to Washington 
knowing how the regional leaders with whom he will meet during 
his tour think. 
  Government sources here have reported Menem will ask Gore at 
that summit that the continent be declared "zone [word 
indistinct] of agricultural subsidies." Menem will also seek 
support for his idea to participate in an effort he calls "white 
lines" to fight poverty in the world. 
  Official spokespersons want to postpone for another occasion 
discussions on "points of discrepancy" so as not to mar the 
dialogue, but certain sectors fear during the visit these issues 
could crawl in to the center of attention. 
  Before making the trip here, the U.S. President praised the 
Argentine economic model and other Menem administration 
initiatives, such as its active participation in UN military 
missions sponsored by the United States. 
  An independent source has reported in addition to the 
announced summit and to the UN military expeditions, Gore and 
Menem will discuss regional integration and free trade agreement 
processes, such as the one signed by Canada, the United States, 
and Mexico. 
  Argentina's forming part of that pact has become a top 
objective of the Argentine Foreign Ministry and Presidency. 
  Despite this, the Clinton administration is conditioning 
that 
step to the approval of a medicines-patent law, which would 
negatively affect Buenos Aires. 
  The U.S. ambassador in Argentina, James Cheek, said this 
week 
the patents issue is a "top priority" of his mission in 
Argentina. This statement drew criticism from opposition 
politicians who accused him of pressuring the South American 
country. 
  Argentine observers have explained the law (on trademarks), 
whose discussion the Argentine parliament has delayed one year, 
would help the U.S. medical industry and harm 20 Argentine 
pharmaceutical laboratories. 
  Local experts have said the market in question involves 
approximately $2 billion annually. They report, despite the 
fact there are no essential differences between Washington and 
Buenos Aires over Argentina forming part of the free trade 
agreement, time is against a quick solution. 
  The U.S. side wants to have established by the end of April 
the countries with which it will negotiate their participation 
in the free trade agreement, but the Argentine Congress will 
debate the patents matter at the beginning of May, and there is 
no guarantee it will approve it, said Jose Genoud, president of 
the Senate Industries Commission. 
  Gore and Menem, who will preside over the opening session of 
a world meeting on telecommunications tomorrow, will also 
discuss matters related to the strengthening of the struggle 
against drug-trafficking, a polemic issue considering the 
meddling attitude made evident in U.S. statements. 
  In addition to suggesting a series of legal measures against 
money laundering and other similar issues, the United States has 
pointed to the suitability of Argentine soldiers fighting the 
scourge (drugs), something Argentine laws forbid. 
  U.S. investments in Argentina are another important issue on 
the Gore-Menem agenda. Two U.S. giants, AT&amp;T and GTE, among 
others, will invest $200 million at the end of this month to 
purchase the rights of Mobile Cellular Telephone in the 
country's interior. 
  While waiting for Gore's visit, Menem met twice with U.S. 
millionaire David Rockefeller who said he has "much trust" in 
Argentina's future.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 18 Mar (PL) -- Cuban Vice President 
Jose Ramon Fernandez reported here today that the United States 
is exerting "all kinds of pressure" against foreign investors 
interested in doing business with his country. 
  While attending a meeting of the Pan American Sports 
Organization in Mar del Plata, 400 km from the capital, Ramon 
Fernandez said the U.S. State Department has threatened those 
businessmen who intend to trade with Cuba. 
  After saying the blockade applied by Washington against the 
island for more than three decades was criminal, the vice 
president of the Council of Ministers said that despite U.S. 
pressure, the number of potential investors in Cuba is on the 
increase. 
  In statements to PRENSA LATINA and an Argentine television 
station, Fernandez noted there has been an increase of 
partnerships with foreign firms in the areas of tourism, 
petroleum exploration, and others. 
  Regarding a recent UN resolution on alleged human rights 
violations on the island, Fernandez explained the resolution 
resulted from a "political vendetta" by the United States, which 
cannot forgive us for Cuba's example to the rest of Latin 
America. 
  The Cuban leader discussed the progress made by his country 
in the area of human rights. He described the functioning of 
participative democracy in Cuba and affirmed that the people 
play an active role in the current ongoing process. 
  Also, Fernandez cited the existence of important rights in 
Cuba, such as the right to have access to health facilities, 
education, food, social security, and assistance. He cited 
statistics that showed the island in a favorable light when 
compared to the most developed countries. 
  Since the victory of the revolution in 1959, there has not 
been one single missing or tortured person in Cuba, Fernandez 
emphasized. 
  When questioned about relations between Havana and Latin 
America, Fernandez said these ties were broad-based, and he 
insisted on the need to work toward regional integration. 
  Cuba, he concluded, is seeking to strengthen everything that 
unites the region and to overcome insignificant issues that 
separate us.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Jose Dos Santos, PRENSA LATINA </F>
collaborator and vice president of the Union of Cuban 
Journalists] 
  [Text] Havana [no dateline as received] -- The U.S. 
Government's policy of constant aggression and hostility has 
been the object of an extensive analysis by the Cuban parliament 
in an effort to unveil the reasons behind the unique situation 
experienced by the Cuban nation, which Washington is denying the 
right to determine its own fate. 
  A detailed document by the Permanent International Relations 
Commission of the National Assembly of the People's Government 
handed to this reporter explains key aspects of this 
aggressiveness, which endangers our national peace and security. 
  The document states, among other things, Cuba is living 
today 
under a partial military blockade despite statements by 
high-ranking U.S. political leaders who have ruled out the 
possibility of a military intervention on the island. 
  In this regard, it notes the decision to recondition the Air 
Force Base in Homestead, Florida, which was destroyed by 
Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and which was scheduled to be shut down 
in early 1993. The reconditioning of this installation adds to 
the increase in the number of planes and activity at the Key 
West Air and Naval Station, located only 90 miles from the Cuban 
coasts, and to the deployment of some 60 warships off Cuba's 
eastern coast under the pretense of the Haitian crisis. 
  U.S. warplanes flew a little more than 64,000 missions over 
the Florida strait during the last three years. During the 
first half of 1993 more than 5,600 missions were flown, some 
only 60 km away from Cuban territory. 
  The Cuban parliament has reported U.S. military forces are 
constantly conducting surveillance operations of all kinds all 
over Cuba. It is a growing trend as can be seen during the 
first 10 months of 1993, when 88 flights of this kind had 
already taken place versus the 45 flights that took place in 
1991. 
  Likewise, the maintenance of Guantanamo Naval Base is part 
of 
the political pressure against Cuba. More than 220 violations 
and provocations against Cuban guards occurred between 1990 and 
1993 from that enclave. In addition during the first half of 
1993 alone a total of 168 ships of different types visited the 
base, where six military exercises of various characteristics 
were conducted. 
  To this dangerous military buildup we may add during this 
same period the intentions of terrorists groups based in the 
United States to attack Cuba. The leaders of some of these 
groups have been arrested, but no judicial ruling regarding 
these groups has been issued. 
<H5>  Other Aggressions </H5>
  Less visible but still persistent tensions regarding Cuba 
may 
be found on the airwaves. Cuba is bombarded by 15 radio 
stations with more than 200 hours a day of anti-Cuban 
programming aimed "at spreading fear and uncertainty, fanaticism 
and insanity, and promoting unscrupulous and unethical 
behaviors." 
  U.S. federal agencies allocated in the last few years more 
than $150 million for the promotion of these broadcasts, many of 
which violate international conventions, misrepresent the truth, 
and conduct other actions aimed at promoting everything from 
subversion and disillusion to desertions every day. 
  This field, called "migratory aggression," has been turned 
into a "subversive political component" by U.S. presidents to 
encourage the departure of illegal aliens, to create internal 
difficulties in Cuba, and to "encourage an international 
campaign that can distort and hurt Cuba's image abroad." 
  If Cubans constitute only .25 percent of the legal 
immigrants 
who arrived in U.S. territory during the last fiscal year and 
2.04 percent of the illegal refugees, why is Cuban immigration 
such a disproportionate issue with such enormous propaganda? 
  The use of this issue as a weapon to attempt to discredit 
Cuba has been a constant element in the past three decades. 
Even though Cuban authorities have allowed the freedom to 
emigrate in the past few years, the obstacles, the whimsical 
selective nature of the permits given, and the clear 
discriminatory policy toward what Washington accepts as eligible 
all preclude the normalization of the migratory movement. 
  Meanwhile, the outlook for the area is critical, and in this 
regard the document mentions the existence of hundreds of 
thousands of illegal Mexican aliens who are virtually suffering 
conditions of slavery in the United States, not to mention the 
thousands who are captured and deported as they attempt to enter 
clandestinely into the country. 
  In view of this outlook, the Cuban legislators believe their 
country has done everything possible to find a sensible and 
civilized solution to the confrontation with the U.S. 
Government, which is not limited to the economic, trade, and 
financial blockade against the island for the past three decades. 
  That is why they believe the solution to the conflict does 
not lie in permanently asking Cuba to make changes to its social 
organization, rather, to "promote external conditions so the 
aspirations to improve the social model freely chosen by the 
Cuban people can effectively take place." 
  To achieve this the Cuban legislators say "the United States 
is the one that needs to be pressured by demanding a change to 
its obsolete and irrational policy toward Cuba."
