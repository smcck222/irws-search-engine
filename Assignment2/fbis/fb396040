  [Text] Geneva, 11 Mar (PL) -- After approving more than 100 
resolutions, the 50th session of the UN Human Rights Commission 
ended with a feeling of uncertainty about the commission's 
impartiality and credibility. 
  The concern about impartiality, closely linked to the 
credibility factor, is based on the Commission's attitude toward 
specific subjects, such as the people's right to 
self-determination, economic, social, cultural, and children's 
rights. 
  Although generally those points are given importance on the 
agenda, when discussed they are viewed with a sense of critical 
selectivity toward developing nations. 
  In contrast, extremely serious matters that prevail in the 
so-called industrialized societies, where for example there is 
social and labor discrimination against women, are overlooked. 
  Selectiveness is also used when judging specific countries 
where special rapporteurs have been appointed, even though 
within the commission, no one doubts that the alleged violations 
requiring specific supervision do not exist. 
  A very interesting example is Cuba, which has had an 
appointed special rapporteur whose mandate was the result of 
U.S. political manipulation of the island's situation since 1990. 
  Of the 108 resolutions adopted, those referring to topic 12 
on the agenda -- violations occurring anywhere -- the majority 
condemn Third World countries, while similar texts linked to 
practices in the industrialized West are nonexistent. 
  Many participants of the forum continue to wonder how much 
longer they must wait before the principles of impartiality, 
nonselectiveness, and objectiveness return to the Commission, 
and some even wonder if they were ever present. 
  Other sectors besides the 53 Commission-member countries, 
such as nongovernmental organizations (ONG) have described the 
50th session results as unbalanced. 
  In evaluating the meeting, Reed Brody, director of the 
International Human Rights Juridical Group and the person who 
coordinates the efforts of more than 3,000 ONG, said it is very 
easy to condemn small countries, but when it comes to powerful 
countries that commit violations, destroy ethnic identities, or 
maintain thousands of prisoners, the Commission is paralyzed. 
  By observing the countries where rapporteurs have been 
appointed (Afghanistan, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Haiti, 
Iran, Iraq, South Africa, Sudan, and the former Yugoslavia), it 
is obvious that no West Europe country is on the list. 
  The 50th session, however, heard numerous reports of 
violations against immigrants, racial discrimination, 
mistreatment, and abuse of power by police forces in countries 
like France, the United States, and the UK, to mention a few. 
  A dozen industrialized nations were mentioned in the ONG 
reports and even in the rapporteur's report on the sale of 
children, child prostitution, teen pornography, illegal 
adoptions, and the illegal commercialization of transplant 
organs, but none were subject to rapporteurs or condemned.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 18 Mar (PL) -- Cuban President 
Fidel Castro today guaranteed the Colombian Government that the 
alleged guerrilla summit meeting reported by Bogota's EL TIEMPO 
did not take place in his country. 
  Emisoras Caracol Network reported as a last-minute scoop 
that 
the leader of the Cuban Revolution telephoned Colombian Foreign 
Minister Noemi Sanin with a message for President Cesar Gaviria. 
  According to the source, Fidel Castro told the Colombian 
minister that "neither Alfonso Cano, Ivan Marquez, nor (Bishop) 
Nel Beltran participated in the Fourth Meeting of Solidarity 
held in Havana on 27 and 28 January of this year, contrary to 
what the newspaper EL TIEMPO has mistakenly reported." 
  According to the radio network, the Cuban leader reported 
that he personally carried out investigations and checked one by 
one all the names of the people who participated in that forum, 
and he can totally and absolutely guarantee, with his word of 
honor at stake, that the subversion leaders in Colombia were not 
in Cuba on the reported dates and did not participated in any 
guerrilla summit. 
  According to Caracol, an annoyed Fidel Castro said 
categorically: There was no guerrilla summit and neither these 
persons nor any other subversive leaders of Latin America took 
part in any such summit. 
  According to the radio report, he added: In a timely manner 
we passed to Cuba's ambassador to Colombia, Jesus Martinez, the 
information we had, and that information tells the truth and 
nothing but the truth. 
  The Cuban chief of state said that there was a prelate at 
the 
Fourth Meeting of Solidarity, a Protestant prelate who lives in 
Medellin, but not the bishop of Sincelejo, Monsignor Nel Beltran. 
  Fidel Castro stated that all this has been part of a setup 
aimed at preventing the sale of Colombian oil to Cuba and at 
marring the two country's bilateral ties. He said that there 
are extraneous and shadowy sources that want to break these 
bilateral ties. 
  The radio network said that the telephone communication will 
be followed by written communication that is already on its way 
and that will be delivered to President Gaviria through the 
Foreign Ministry probably tomorrow or, at the latest, Sunday.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 17 Mar (PL) -- Cuban Ambassador 
Jesus Martinez reiterated today none of the Colombian guerrilla 
commanders mentioned by the Colombian newspaper EL TIEMPO has 
traveled to his country or met there. 
  In statements made to Radio Santa Fe, the diplomat said such 
accusations have been made to attempt to damage the relations 
between both countries, which, he said, are excellent now. 
  In this respect, Martinez said Colombian Foreign Minister 
Noemi Sanin and Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos are 
scheduled to visit Cuba shortly. 
  Bishop Nel Beltran, which the newspaper EL TIEMPO mentions 
as 
one of the participants of the alleged meeting of guerrilla 
commanders in Havana during the latter part of January, has told 
two radio stations today he was not in Cuba at that time, is not 
familiar with that country, and much less had met with the 
people the newspaper has mentioned. 
  In a news conference held this afternoon, Colombian Foreign 
Minister Sanin reported although the reports on this alleged 
event have not been proven, they will ask the Cuban Government 
for explanations,because the Prosecutor's Office has stated the 
EL TIEMPO reports could be true. 
  She admitted if this were true, they would not ask for 
explanations, and she said she hoped they will be satisfactory 
to clarify the issue. [sentence as received] 
  Regarding Beltran's denial, she said she believes the 
bishop, 
whom she has known for a long time. She also spotlighted the 
bishop's attributes and contributions to the country.

  [Text] Kingston, 17 Mar (PL) -- Cuba has reaffirmed its 
commitment to regional integration during a technical meeting to 
discuss the establishment of the Caribbean State Association 
[Asociacion de Estados Caribenos -- AEC]. The technical meeting 
runs through Friday at Kingston's convention center. 
  The meeting, which has brought together numerous 
representatives from most of the countries and territories that 
border the Caribbean Sea, yesterday evening held its first 
working session, which was attended by nearly every chief 
delegate. 
  Cuban Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ramon Sanchez Parodi 
reaffirmed Cuba's commitment to regional integration and 
reasserted that Cuba remains an inseparable part of the 
Caribbean region. 
  The vice foreign minister stressed that Cuba believes it has 
the duty and obligation to fully support efforts to establish 
the AEC because of Cuba's cultural, geographic, historic, and 
economic ties to all of the Caribbean Basin nations. 
  In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Sanchez Parodi 
underscored that the fundamental feature of the first day of 
work was the agreement among representatives of the various 
subregions to join the association, regardless of other issues 
that may be raised in the course of the meeting. 
  Experts from Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela, the special 
French Government envoy for overseas Caribbean departments, and 
other officials outlined their points of view regarding the 
future intergovernmental organization's potential structure, 
scope, and outlook. 
  On Thursday, the agenda will deal with technical discussions 
on membership, the goals of the organization's primary agencies, 
decisionmaking procedures, and financing -- all of which are 
elements contained in the draft document dealing with the 
founding of the AEC. 
  Observers believe that a specialists meeting might be needed 
before a ministerial-level meeting to finalize the groundwork 
for the AEC, which is scheduled to be approved by the 
member-nations' heads of state and government who will meet in 
Barbados in July.

<F P=106> [Report by Mercedes Ramos: "It Looks Like Gold... And It Is"] </F>
  [Text] Havana -- Gold, that highly coveted mineral which 
has cost the life of more than one person, also benefits Cuba 
with its presence in at least five of the country's regions, two 
of which look like good prospects. The authorities see the new 
possibility of gold production opening up for Cuba as a means of 
diversifying national production and at the same time as another 
source of revenue and another opportunity to trade with foreign 
investors. 
  According to Jose Casa de Valle, technical director of the 
Geological-Mining Union of Cuba, the possibilities of producing 
the valuable metal in Cuba are excellent because he considers it 
to be highly profitable, especially in the Pinar del Rio region 
where the mining process has already begun. 
  In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, the official said they 
expect to produce 300 kg in 1994 from the Castellanos deposit in 
Pinar del Rio, in the western part of the country, and 500 kg 
per year is expected in the near future. 
  He said a sulfometals [sulfometales] plant there was adapted 
to obtain gold ingots through mass lixiviation. The final 
product is 99.999-percent pure gold. 
  From that deposit, he added, 1 to 1.5 grams of gold per ton 
are extracted, which is the average measure for gold. 
  He said they are conducting gold exploration and 
exploitation 
on their own, without foreign investments, at that plant. In the 
case of polymetals [polimetales], such as lead, zinc, and other 
minerals, however, we are exploring the Pinar del Rio zone with 
help from foreign companies, mainly Canadian. 
  When asked about the participation of foreign companies in 
the exploration and exploitation of minerals in the country, 
Casa de Valle explained the island is divided into 37 blocks for 
geological prospecting and more than 20 contracts have already 
been signed with foreign investors, particularly Canadians, for 
the random exploration of solid minerals. 
  That is also the case of Delita on the Isle of Youth; El 
Descanso in Villa Clara, in the central part of the country; 
Jobabo in eastern Camaguey Province; and Aguas Claras in Holguin. 
  The executive, with 27 years of experience in the field, 
thinks the deposit at Delita is the most promising because, 
according to geological studies, it is currently the largest ore 
deposit in the country. 
  Notwithstanding, gold mining there is complicated because 
the 
mineral is mixed with large quantities of arsenic, an 
undesirable element from every point of view. 
  He said: The exploitation of that deposit is being 
negotiated 
with foreign companies, and the research was carried out by 
Cuban specialists. 
  He explained: We believe that if those investments are made 
within two or three years, Delita will yield between 2.5 to 3 
tons of gold per year. 
  He said the remaining deposits, El Descanso and Melonera, in 
Villa Clara, are currently in the research phase. They are 
relatively small but they have a high content of the mineral. 
  He thinks the region is the most promising as far as gold 
discovery is concerned. Canadian companies are conducting 
explorations at random there, but there is still no final 
evaluation. 
  Casa de Valle reiterated that the prospects in that zone are 
vast because conditions are similar to the deposit in Nevada, 
United States, and Pueblo Viejo, in the Dominican Republic. 
  In referring to the Aguas Claras mine in eastern Holguin 
Province, the specialist said negotiations are under way with 
foreign companies to explore areas around that mine since it is 
presumed it contains gold. Until recently, and even prior to 
1959, molten gold was taken from that region to Pinar del Rio, 
where it was processed. The reserve ran out some time ago, 
however, and mining stopped. 
  Speaking about the island's gold prospects, which is so 
useful in the electronic's industry because it is an excellent 
electricity conductor and is rustproof, Casa de Valle said 
mining and processing were highly profitable in Pinar del Rio 
because investments there had been minimal (between $6 million 
to $8 million). Delita is also considered profitable despite the 
complexity of the zone, given its proximity to the sea. It 
requires an investment of between $40 and $50 million but the 
gold there could be exploited for at least 20 years. He said 
that with these prospects, the country will soon become one of 
Latin America's gold producers, led by Chile, Brazil, and Peru, 
among other nations.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" PRENSA LATINA article entitled "Cuban </F>
Challenges; Balance the Cuban Budget in an Unbalanced World," by 
Jose Dos Santos, vice president of the Union of Cuban 
Journalists] 
  [Text] Havana -- Advance planning of income and 
expenditures for a certain activity during an established time 
is by definition the same as budgeting. In Cuba's case, it 
becomes a matter of top priority to get the most from what is 
available, which generally speaking when dealing with the 
economy is not much. 
  State Committee for Finance (CEF) authorities, when 
explaining the complexity of this field, pointed out that Cuba 
has had a formal budget for many years. It distributed what was 
available and obtained through stable economic and international 
trade relations, which Cuba maintained with the socialist field, 
especially the Soviet Union. 
  This mechanism began to run into difficulties while at the 
same time others did not keep their agreements, and trade rules 
and values were changed; consequently the Cuban economy began to 
collapse forcing changes, adjustments, and unprecedented 
measures, mostly economic in nature. 
  With the new conditions, it is very clear that Cuba cannot 
spend income it does not have, especially since most of its 
international credit sources are blocked by the economic, trade, 
and financial blockade imposed and advocated by the United 
States. 
  More than 50 percent of Cuba's general income budget comes 
from the state sector, the rest comes from nonstate entities and 
what is collected by the population; a ratio that could be 
proportionally modified according to increased joint ventures 
and self-employed workers' activities, which in turn are subject 
to taxes. 
  Basic state expenses have been aimed at enterprises, 
described here as budgeted (completely state controlled), 
business activities (that is partly self-financed), and other 
investments. 
  In the first group, which many times the state assumes 
without properly figuring the cost, are enterprises that 
guarantee social security, an expenditure that in 1993 amounted 
to 1.5 billion pesos (equivalent to dollars at the official 
exchange rate). Education, public health, and other basic 
sectors for citizens are fundamental and respond to the nature 
of the Cuban social system, but at the same time are high 
resource consumers. 
  The population has discussed these topics in depth the past 
few weeks. The assemblies convened by the Cuban union movement, 
called "Workers' Parliaments," have no doubts about free 
schooling and medical assistance among the other things that 
Cuban society is already used to. 
  Nevertheless, the reality has begun to sink into the 
mentality of the average Cuban who is used to watching sports 
competitions for free, which caused more than headaches during 
the organization of the Central American and Pan-American Games; 
or the reality of free, complex, and costly surgical operations, 
such as aesthetic surgery, for no clinical or humanitarian 
reason. 
  Expenditures which the state has mostly paid, like science 
and technology, sports, art and culture, have begun to be 
considered as important ways of generating resources and are 
rapidly becoming not only self-financed, but considered to be 
revenue earners. 
<H5>  Expensive Enterprises </H5>
  Cuba puts the most emphasis on the business sector to 
achieve 
increased efficiency and productivity to stem the economic 
deterioration caused by the new realities, which the condemned 
Torricelli Law plays no small role through increased harassment. 
  A high-ranking CEF official told this journalist that to 
reverse the current situation, state subsidies for losses by the 
state enterprises need to be reduced to a minimum. This past 
year, the sugar and agricultural sectors were the worst, needing 
more than 4 billion pesos. 
  Generally speaking, it has been said that 69 percent of 
Cuban 
productive businesses receive subsidies, therefore, only 31 of 
100 enterprises contribute to the state budget. 
  Therefore, it is not enough to reduce investments -- a 
development mortgage -- to effectively stop the budget deficit. 
<H5>  Steps </H5>
  The measures that have already begun to be applied with 
little publicity but with significant effect are aimed at 
decentralizing even further the administration of what has been 
budgeted by the state with a spending limit for certain 
financial allotments to prevent excesses (in salaries, for 
example, to avoid arbitrary job creations). 
  Likewise, the idea is for greater financial resource 
disbursement freedom and to make them more productive while not 
deviating from the general plan of overall economy development. 
  The course that is being followed contributes greater 
flexibility to budget activities so as to increase 
self-financing without forgetting to see that assigned funds are 
being used as they were intended. Therefore, each part of the 
economic puzzle should fit properly in the Cuban social pattern. 
  A complex struggle is taking place, and it must be won in 
order for Cuba's social income-expenditures to balance in an 
unbalanced world. Achieving this will guarantee future, stable, 
and harmonious development, which will allow one to remember the 
current special period Cuba is facing as the feverish state a 
body feels from the effects of a vaccine intended to save it 
from serious illness.

  [Text] Havana, 16 Mar (PL) -- Ricardo Alarcon and Pedro 
Ross, the top leaders of the parliament and of the Cuban Workers 
Federation (CTC), respectively, today expressed their confidence 
that current consultations with the labor union rank and file 
will contribute to resolving the nation's finances. 
  When questioned on this issue, Alarcon told PRENSA LATINA: I 
think these have facilitated reaching a consensus on certain 
actions of a national character that must be taken, and, with 
this goal in mind, identifying solutions in each work center. 
  Since the end of January, the CTC has been holding 
assemblies 
in its more than 80,000 rank and file organizations so the 
workers may express their opinions and make proposals on facing 
up to Cuba's serious financial woes. 
  Official figures indicate that more than 10 billion pesos -- 
equal to the same amount in dollars at the official exchange 
rate -- in excess cash and a fiscal deficit of more than 4.2 
billion are factors that have turned into major destabilizers of 
the Cuban economy. The economy is facing its most difficult 
moment in the past 30 years. 
  In practical terms, the president of the National Assembly 
said the consultation process has allowed thousands of specific 
measures to emerge while other ideas are currently being applied 
in many parts of the Island. 
  Meanwhile, Ross stressed that the process has surpassed the 
labor leaders' expectations given the depth of the workers 
suggestions and the proposals to solve the problems. 
  He indicated that there was a high rate of attendance at the 
assemblies, more than 86 percent. He explained that important 
solutions have already been adopted to specifically solve the 
companies' finances, thanks to their own workers' initiative. 
  Ross added that the matters of national character are being 
analyzed and collected to be handed over to the government's and 
parliament's highest levels for consideration. 
  All suggestions will be taken into account, from those that 
counted in the opinion of the majority to those that were 
proposed by a single worker, he noted. 
  The National Assembly has slated for this year one special 
session to analyze the situation of internal finances and to 
adopt measures to correct these. These measures, according to 
legislators and government, are not removed from the principles 
of social justice currently in force in Cuba.

<F P=106> [Report by Raimundo Lopez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 17 Mar (PL) -- Ricardo Alarcon, president of 
the National Assembly of the People's Government, said today 
that thousands of proposals from workers are being implemented 
to clean up the internal finances of the country. 
  In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Alarcon explained that this 
is one of the main results of the consultation with the labor 
union rank and file to seek alternatives for the recovery of the 
national economy. 
  That process, initiated under the leadership of the Cuban 
Workers Federation at the end of last January, concluded this 
Wednesday after some 80,000 assemblies attended by more than 3 
million persons were held at the work centers. 
  The workers assemblies, Alarcon said, have served to discuss 
collectively the possible general measures. The assemblies have 
permitted each worker to express his opinions and discuss them 
along with the opinions of others, so as to form a collective 
consensus. 
  I think they have been useful in creating consensus behind 
specific actions to be launched at the national level, Alarcon 
stressed. 
  The legislative leader asserted that this aspect is as 
important as the identification in each work center of the 
problems and the decisions that are necessary "to immediately 
reduce costs and improve efficiency." 
  From this point of view, Alarcon continued, thousands of 
proposals and specific measures have been positively identified 
and have materialized. Many of these measures are already being 
implemented; they are being executed. 
  Since losing its former socialist bloc commercial partners, 
Cuba has faced an adverse economic situation, which in financial 
terms is expressed in an excess of currency amounting to over 10 
billion pesos -- equal to the U.S. dollar at the official 
exchange rate -- a 4.2-billion-peso fiscal deficit, and high 
subsidies. 
  This situation deteriorated further as a result of the 
tightening of the blockade the United States imposed on the 
island more than three decades ago, which authorities estimate 
has caused losses amounting to at least $40 billion.

  [Text] Havana, 14 Mar (PL) -- Today TRABAJADORES, the Cuban 
labor unions' mouthpiece, called for associations among Cuban 
enterprises and not only with foreign capital. 
  In its Monday editorial, the newspaper indicates that "there 
is often a trend to seek solutions to the idle (industrial) 
facilities based only on deals with foreign capital, which are 
important but do not constitute the only way out." 
  The publication points out that "it is necessary to use all 
association possibilities among Cuban enterprises -- a sort of 
`South to South cooperation' -- on a local scale." 
  It later says: "There are businessmen who prefer to bring 
anything from abroad, using such arguments as quality, 
timeliness, and efficiency." 
  It goes on by saying: "This, which could be justified in 
some 
cases, in others implies, and we know it, an inadmissible 
resurgence of taking the easy way out, narrow vision, and an 
inability to see the country's problems in a comprehensive 
manner." 
  TRABAJADORES believes that "there is actually a coherent 
policy designed to reorganize and reestablish the national 
economy but that all the economic sectors will not come out of 
the serious crisis Cuba currently faces at the same time or in 
the same way." 
  TRABAJADORES reiterates: "It is necessary to motivate the 
strategic sectors that generate foreign currency, manufacture 
substitutes for things that are imported, ensure the supply of 
food, and those sectors that have the greatest chance to recover 
and thrive." 
  However, the publication points out that "the principle of 
the struggle we are waging should not be based on the idea of 
`every man for himself' or `let us save a lucky few in some 
sectors.'" 
  TRABAJADORES underscores that "our philosophy, which is just 
and realistic, is that of saving all and viewing the country and 
the people as one entity."

  [Text] Havana, 15 Mar (PL) -- The main applications of 
nuclear techniques in Cuban agriculture include the genetic 
improvement of crops, diagnostic control of seeds, and insect 
radiobiology to reduce the use of pesticides. 
  Dr. Adolfo Rodriguez Nodals, director of the Institute of 
Basic Research on Tropical Agriculture [Inifat], said that they 
are also working on developing the Nitrogen 15 marking system 
[marcaje] to improve fertilizers. 
  Rodriguez Nodals explained that over 20 scientific 
organizations, which constitute the Group for the Research and 
Application of Nuclear Techniques in Agriculture [GIATNA], are 
participating in this project. In less than six years since its 
creation, GIATNA is experimenting with cutting-edge technologies. 
  According to a communique from the UN Food and Agriculture 
Organization [FAO] that was disclosed recently, modern 
agriculture can be productive because it efficiently uses new 
scientific and technological knowledge. 
  Just when FAO General Director Jacques Diouf advocated a 
"new 
agricultural revolution," Cubans are proving the effectiveness 
of the application of novel techniques on crops. 
  The yield of three rice varieties through the use of 
radiation to induce new genetic characteristics in plants is 
among the scientific results obtained by Cubans, and it 
exemplifies the peaceful use of nuclear technologies. 
  In addition to this, progress is being made in the 
application of radioactive isotopes in phosphoric fertilizers 
and the training of personnel in dosimetry and radiation safety. 
  The 200 researchers of Inifat, which was established in 1904 
as Cuba's central agricultural research station and which was 
considered back then unique in Latin America, are working in the 
areas mentioned.

<F P=106> [By Carmen Gonzalez Hernadez: "Research and Experience. The </F>
Cuban Population is Aging"] 
  [Text] [no dateline as received] -- Local experts have said 
a drop in the nation's fertility rate in which the number of 
young people goes down raises the population's age and brings it 
closer to the demographic patterns of the world's more developed 
countries. 
  Based on Cuban Statistical Research Institute projections 
for 
the next century, Cuba will have 11.504 million inhabitants, 
with more women, by the start of the next millennium. 
  "By the year 2020, approximately 28.9 percent of the 
population will be 60 years old or older, thereby drawing closer 
to Sweden's levels, for example, where the percentage of elderly 
people was 22.8 percent in 1992," Dr. Raul Hernandez Castellon 
told PRENSA LATINA. 
  The head of the Cuban Center for Demographic Studies said 
Cuba is one of the few countries in Latin America experiencing 
an early demographic revolution process; a transition that began 
its first phase during this century's first three decades. 
  "From 1902 to 1928, the United States invested approximately 
$1.5 billion in the island, generating a great migratory current 
to meet the labor force needs," he indicated. According to 
statistics from that time, approximately 750,000 Spaniards and 
250,000 Haitians, Jamaicans, and Puerto Ricans entered the 
country. This situation influenced the age and gender structure 
because most of the immigrants were working-age, single men. 
  At the same time, the high levels of urban development 
reached and the relative progress in education, he said, were 
factors that influenced the reproductive behavior of the Cuban 
population. Studies indicated that the major characteristics 
of the second phase of the demographic transition was the change 
in the direction of the migratory movements, since the nation 
had become a source of emigrants owing to contradictions in the 
economy and other factors. 
  Afterward, when the new government took over in 1959, 
another 
migratory movement of economic and political nature evolved. 
  Later, the fertility rate dropped below the replacement 
level 
and, finally, a stunning increase in the life expectancy rate 
occurred. That was when the first signs of aging began to appear. 
  In making a detailed analysis of this phenomenon, Dr. 
Hernandez Castellon indicated that, with few exceptions, the 
Cuban population has maintained a rather low annual growth rate 
compared to developing countries. 
  Over a period as long as 62 years, between 1919 and 1981, he 
added, the rate was 1.95 percent, although the population 
increased approximately 6.8 million, as the census indicated. 
  In fact, until 1950, the arrival of emigrants contributed to 
a relatively high growth rate of 2.31 percent. 
  Although the rate went from 2.8 children to 1.8 per woman 
from 1919 to 1953, the migratory flow basically influenced the 
age and gender structure. 
  For that reason, there were more men than women from 1919 to 
1981, but by 1990, statistics showed a balance with women had 
been reached. 
  "Regarding people younger than 15 years of age, Cuba is on 
par with Europe's developed countries, with 22.8 percent in 
1990," Dr. Hernandez Castellon noted. 
  The profound socioeconomic changes in the country since 1959 
have undoubtedly influenced the recent demographic evolution in 
the island, the experts stated. 
  "There was a noticeable increase in births in the early 
1960's and the "baby boom" [preceding two words in English] 
peaked in 1963, when the birth rate shot up to 35.1 births for 
every 1,000 residents," the expert noted. 
  The reason for that was, in addition to the couple's 
economic 
security and their confidence in the future, abortions were 
restricted, and there were no contraceptives on the local market. 
  The arrival of electricity to remote areas allowed the news 
media to reach those places, which resulted in more education 
for the residents. 
  Family planning orientation was also extended throughout the 
country; an aspect that was accompanied by making diverse 
contraceptive means available to every woman. We must also 
mention the legalization of abortion, which, though it may not 
be regarded as a contraceptive, allows the couple to have the 
children they want. 
  "Another very important aspect regarding the aging of the 
population is found in the life expectancy rate from birth. In 
1950, it was 58 years and now is over 75 years," Dr. Hernandez 
Castellon reiterated. 
  This has been possible, he said, even though the infant 
mortality rate has dropped every year, so that by 1993 it had 
decreased to 9.4 for every 1,000 live births.

  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Mar -- Bolivian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Aranibar said here today that U.S. Vice President Al 
Gore is interested in knowing the positions of Bolivia, 
Argentina, and Brazil regarding the continental summit organized 
by U.S. President Bill Clinton for December in Miami. 
  Bolivia was the first country visited by Gore on his tour to 
these three countries. Aranibar met with the U.S. vice 
president during the eight hours he was in Bolivia yesterday 
before traveling to Buenos Aires, where he finds himself today. 
  Aranibar told EFE that Gore had expressed his wish to 
receive 
from the Latin American leaders "topics for the future 
inter-American dialogue," an initiative that demands appropriate 
preparation. 
  Gore also discussed drug enforcement with Bolivian President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and other Bolivian personalities, 
although it was "not the central subject" of conversation, 
Aranibar said. 
  Following his visit to Bolivia, Gore is currently in Buenos 
Aires, from where he will travel to Brasilia, the last leg of 
his Latin American tour. He will stay in Brasilia for six hours. 
  The Bolivian foreign minister arrived today on an official 
flight from La Paz to attend a meeting of the foreign ministers 
of the Rio Group. The Rio Group is made up of 13 members: 
Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, 
Paraguay, Uruguay, Mexico, Ecuador, Guatemala (representing 
Central America), and Trinidad and Tobago (representing the 
Caribbean). 
  The 48-hour Rio Group meeting began today at Itamaraty 
Palace, and is being held precisely to discuss positions for the 
summit organized by Clinton, and for a preliminary document 
prepared by experts from several governments and the Economic 
Commission for Latin America, ECLA, on "poverty, the neglected 
sectors, and unemployment." 
  Regarding the summit in Miami, Aranibar said that the 
countries of the continent must prepare "an agenda for the new 
world" which must include the main subjects that will dominate 
the inter-American dialogue in the next few years. 
  He also said that certain subjects connected with economic 
and social development, as well as regional integration -- 
including the possible membership of other Latin American 
countries to the North American Free Trade Agreement among the 
United States, Canada, and Mexico -- must also be included in 
the agenda. 
  According to Aranibar, the inter-American subjects for the 
Miami summit must include participative democracy, the struggle 
against corruption, the stability and solidness of the 
democratic institutions, and rational development.

  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Mar (EFE) -- Venezuelan Foreign 
Minister Miguel Angel Burelli told EFE today in Brasilia that 
the eradication of poverty must be "the number one issue" at the 
continental summit called by U.S. President Bill Clinton for 
December in Miami (United States). 
  The Venezuelan minister said he believes Clinton's 
initiative 
is of "supreme interest" as a way to develop new relations 
between the United States and Latin America following the end of 
the Cold War. 
  Burelli said: "We hope the schedule" for the Miami summit 
"will be established soon." Burelli will participate in a 
48-hour meeting of foreign ministers and governmental 
representatives from 13 Rio Group countries that begins today at 
Itamaraty, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry headquarters. 
  This summit will allow an exchange of opinions toward 
consensus among Latin American governments before the summit 
called by President Clinton, and to review the international 
situation. 
  The ministers will establish the bases for two upcoming Rio 
Group summits: the talks that are held twice a year with the EC 
foreign ministers -- scheduled for 20-23 April in Sao Paulo -- 
and the Eighth Annual Rio Group summit scheduled for 8-9 
September in Rio de Janeiro. 
  Even though it is not on the agenda, the delegates will use 
the meeting to probe preferences for the election of a new OAS 
secretary general on 27 March in Washington. 
  Diplomatic sources have stated that this issue will crop up 
in lobby talks and even in the Rio Group's three flexible 
sessions as any delegation head is allowed to raise it. 
  Foreign Minister Burelli is one of the candidates for the 
OAS 
General Secretariat, replacing Brazilian diplomat Joao Baena 
Soares, whose five-year term ends in June. 
  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Costa Rican Foreign 
Minister Bernd Niehaus are also running. 
  Foreign Minister Burelli indicated that the Rio Group must 
forge "a social bias" for Latin American policy because "the 
people eagerly want consideration in the decision-making 
process." 
  Burelli said: "Poverty represents a new scourge within 
society as it has new elements of insecurity that cannot be 
fought with armies. It is tied to hunger, terrorism, drug 
trafficking, violence, and growing destitution." 
  Burelli said that internal and external migration in Latin 
American countries has helped to form "pockets" of misery in 
large cities. He mentioned the migration from rural areas and 
the arrival of about 60,000 Guyanese citizens in Venezuela. 
They become involved in the underground economy. 
  The people responsible for regional diplomacy will assess a 
preliminary document entitled: "Poverty, Destitution, and 
Unemployment." This document was compiled at the Rio Group's 
request by experts from various governments, the Economic 
Commission for Latin America (ECLA), and the United Nations. 
  The document proposes guidelines to cure the phenomena and 
will become a Rio Group's contribution for the UN Conference on 
Social Development scheduled for 1995 in the city of Copenhagen.

  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Mar -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister 
Miguel Angel Burelli, who is a candidate for the post of general 
secretary of the OAS, said today in Brasilia that the OAS, which 
comprises 35 nations of the continent, could become a great 
organization. 
  "An inferiority complex has been created regarding the OAS, 
and it is necessary to overcome it," Burelli said. He 
challenged the other candidates, Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria and Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, to a 
television debate -- possibly over the U.S. CNN Channel. 
  Regarding the acceptance of his initiative, the Venezuelan 
foreign minister told EFE that "the ball is in their court." 
  Burelli is participating in Brasilia in a 48-hour meeting of 
the foreign ministers and government delegates of the 13 
countries of the Rio Group, the main mechanism for political and 
economic agreement within Latin America. 
  The ambassadors of OAS member countries will elect a 
successor of the Brazilian diplomat Joao Baena Soares, who has 
occupied the post of OAS secretary general for two consecutive 
5-year periods since 1984. 
  Referring to Gaviria, Burelli said that never -- during the 
history of the organization -- has the United States ever 
proposed a candidate on its own initiative. 
  Gaviria's candidacy is supported by several Rio Group 
countries including Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and 
Argentina. 
  Burelli highlighted the OAS system of organization, which 
has 
a developed administrative apparatus and a democratic hue 
because each nation, no matter how large or small, has one vote. 
  The Venezuelan foreign minister -- who was Venezuelan 
ambassador to Washington, London, and Bogota -- added that he 
will not campaign during the Rio Group meeting. He said: "I 
have come to the meeting and that is all." 
  Burelli said that "there are new factors" to evaluate 
regarding the Cuban situation. "The Cuban people have suffered 
a lot. There cannot be the same confrontation of ideas now as 
in bygone days." 
  Baena Soares said he believes it is necessary to consider 
the 
reintegration of Cuba into the OAS because "the 1990's are not 
the 1960's." 
  Burelli complained to EFE about the interpretation by the 
international media of the Venezuelan situation following the 
December 1993 elections in which Rafael Caldera became president. 
  "The international press is not convinced that ethical 
standards are being changed" in Venezuela, he explained. 
  Burelli said President Caldera is willing to "completely 
reorganize the family" of his country, by offering pardons to 
all military officers who rose up in arms against the government 
of then President Carlos Andres Perez. 
  He added that those who found refuge in Peru are now 
returning, adding that five officers being held the San Carlos 
Garrison in Caracas will be released "at any moment."

  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Mar (EFE) -- Uruguay has proposed 
seeking a consensus candidate in the elections for OAS general 
secretary to be held in Washington on 27 March. This proposal 
was made in Brasilia today. 
  Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu pointed out that the 
initiative for seeking a consensus candidate "may seem a vague 
response, but it is in fact a responsible one" given the 
atmosphere of confrontation arising from the candidacies of 
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Costa Rican Foreign 
Minister Bernd Niehaus. 
  The third aspirant for replacing Brazilian diplomat Joao 
Baena Soares is Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel 
Burelli, who together with Abreu is participating in the two-day 
meeting of Rio Group foreign ministers which was inaugurated 
today at Itamaraty, the seat of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. 
  The Uruguayan Foreign Minister noted that the controversy 
between groups of countries -- Central America and the Caribbean 
support Niehaus, whereas North and South America endorse Gaviria 
-- may lead to a split in the organization, which could have an 
adverse effect on the tenure of the next secretary general. 
  Abreu neither gave many details about his initiative, nor 
did 
he put forward for consideration the name of a possible 
candidate. He said that his proposal had met with the approval 
of the Rio Group delegations, especially those from countries 
that fear a split in the OAS. 
  Abreu stated: "The OAS ought not to go to elections with a 
confrontation. If we leave things as they stand now, we will 
start the new tenure of the General Secretariat with an 
entrenched split." 
  Seven of the 13 Rio Group nations -- Mexico, Argentina, 
Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Colombia, and Peru -- support Gaviria 
on the grounds that his election will bring prestige to the OAS, 
as he has successfully discharged his duties as Colombian 
president, his four-year term in office expiring in August. 
  Although his country supports Gaviria, Argentine Deputy 
Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella seconded the idea of debating 
a consensus formula. 
  Within the Rio Group, Chile, Guatemala, and Trinidad and 
Tobago endorse Niehaus' candidacy. Only Venezuela endorses 
Burelli. 
  The other members of the group have not yet decided for whom 
they will vote. Uruguay is in favor of reaching a consensus on 
the candidacy, and Ecuador -- which had pledged to support 
Niehaus in 1993 -- has recently indicated that it will not come 
to a decision until the minute before each country's ambassador 
hands in the ballots at the OAS headquarters. 
  Diplomatic sources in Brasilia reported that if Gaviria 
decides not to run for office, Bolivia would be willing to vote 
for the Costa Rican foreign minister. 
  In response to a question asked of him by reporters, Chilean 
Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa said that he will respect "the 
commitment" to vote for Niehaus made by former President 
Patricio Aylwin several years ago, when Gaviria was not yet a 
candidate. 
  This pledge is included in a joint declaration issued by 
Aylwin and Costa Rican President Rafael Calderon -- both of whom 
are Social Democrats -- after a meeting.

<F P=106> [Report by Nelson Murillo] </F>
  [Text] Puntarenas -- Finance Minister Carlos Munoz said 
yesterday that the country will face difficulties in servicing 
the foreign debt and a reduction in available credit if the 
future administration decides to replace the PAE III [Economic 
Adjustment Program] with loans to specific sectors. 
  After saying it was inadvisable to continue "patching up the 
economy," the official asserted that opting for loans to 
specific sectors instead of the PAE III would entail at least 18 
months of negotiations. Thus, the official stated, the loan 
option is "ineffective." 
  Munoz was one of the main speakers at a economics seminar 
attended by 30 journalists at the Hotel Fiesta in Puntarenas. 
The seminar ended yesterday. 
  At that event, Munoz said the country should continue on the 
path to economic modernization, commercial opening, and smaller 
government. The finance minister emphasized that the Jose 
Maria Figueres Olsen administration, which will take office on 8 
May, could renegotiate PAE III with the World Bank. The 
minister pointed out, however, that the government would loose 
its ability to pay the foreign debt and, in this case, 
international creditors would probably withdraw our credit. 
  Central Bank President Jorge Corrales emphasized that the 
negotiation of separate loans to certain sectors as an 
alternative to the PAE III would lead to high payments by Costa 
Rica and -- in his opinion -- there are not enough resources for 
that. 
  President-elect Jose Maria Figueres said the debate on PAE 
III "had been overcome" when he met with President Rafael Angel 
Calderon Fournier. 
  The current government insists that this program, which will 
provide the country with $180 million, should be approved by the 
Legislative Assembly, while the future administration rejects 
the program because it believes that it was not negotiated "in a 
Costa Rican manner [a la tica]." 
  Minister Munoz asserted that the PAE III would integrate the 
Costa Rican economy into the new international commerce currents 
because it will increase productivity, reorganize the financial 
sector, promote savings, and guarantee more funds for social 
programs. He added that it would reduce poverty and 
unemployment and would allow the private sector to receive a 
flow of resources that would encourage production. 
  Commenting on the economic reforms by the Calderon Fournier 
administration, Munoz said: "This process cannot be a reversed. 
I don't believe the PLN [National Liberation Party] is thinking 
of canceling it because that would create serious problems for 
the country. The PAE III is necessary to maintain economic 
stability and foreign financing."

  [Text] San Jose, 16 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- President-elect Jose 
Maria Figueres said today he will continue his country's 
economic opening but in an "intelligent manner" to compete in 
terms of the quality and utilization of technologies and not a 
cheap labor force. 
  During a lunch with the Costa Rican Union of Private 
Enterprise Chambers and Associations (UCCAEP), the man who will 
be governing Costa Rica beginning 8 May warned in his 
administration he will seek a "true commercial opening." 
  "We have opened the economy, but we need greater vitality to 
compete more intelligently with greater courage, not with lower 
wages," Figures said, adding he will strengthen and improve the 
quality of social programs. 
  He promised businessmen, however, he will respect 
"macroeconomic balances" by lowering the fiscal and commercial 
deficits and will promote tax reform not to impose more taxes 
but to improve the collection of existing ones. 
  UCCAEP President Marco Vinicio Ruiz said "the key of 
success" 
for Costa Rican society depends fundamentally on achieving a 
successful and high quality incorporation into the world economy. 
  "This can only be attained if the country advances in 
congruence with improving competitiveness and Costa Ricans' 
quality of life," the business group leader said.

  [Text] San Jose, 20 Mar (DPA) -- Costa Rican antinarcotics 
police are currently investigating possible connections of a 
drug trafficking group dismantled this past Friday in Alajuela, 
30 km west of San Jose, with the Colombian Pereira drug cartel. 
Colombian citizens Luis Carlos Diez Diez and Moises Nader 
Vargas, as well as Costa Rican citizen Carlos Alvarado were 
arrested during the police operation. According to the 
authorities, the group had smuggled approximately 720 kg of 
cocaine to Europe through Costa Rica. 
  Public Security Minister Luis Fishman said 17 Costa Rican 
nationals currently detained in Spain, Netherlands, Germany, 
Belgium, France, and Italy on drug trafficking charges could 
belong to this group. During the past six years, the Colombian 
drug cartels have used Costa Rica to transfer cocaine to the 
United States and Europe. It is estimated that between two and 
four tons of cocaine are being shipped monthly from Costa Rica 
despite government efforts to crack-down on drug trafficking. 
  Between 1992 and 1993, anti-narcotics agencies seized 
approximately 1,500 kg of cocaine. More than 100 foreigners, 
including several Colombians, are imprisoned in Costa Rican 
jails as result of their links to drug trafficking.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 19 Mar (DPA) -- Today, Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria temporarily overcame the ministerial 
crisis that arose last night when Labor Minister Luis Fernando 
Ramirez, who was proclaimed vice presidential candidate by the 
Conservative Party, resigned. 
  According to the text of a presidential decree issued today 
and given to DPA, Gaviria entrusted the ministry to Deputy 
Minister Gerardo Hernandez. A labor minister is expected to be 
appointed next week. He will regulate decrees for the social 
security reform approved by Congress late last year. 
  The reform was sponsored by Ramirez, who registered today as 
presidential candidate Andres Pastrana's ticket partner, and he 
immediately announced an ambitious and quick tour of Colombia. 
Ramirez was appointed labor minister in July 1992 on behalf of 
the New Democratic Force (FND), a conservative group founded by 
Pastrana, who announced a campaign and promised a government 
with supraparty leanings.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 19 Mar (EFE) -- Today, a total 
of 18 Colombian presidency candidates registered with the 
Registrar's Office, the country's election authority, for the 8 
May elections. The election office also established the number 
corresponding to each candidate on the voting ballot, a sheet 
that includes the list of candidates and also information with 
respect to the name of the movement or party, the respective 
number, a photograph, and the candidate's name. 
  The majority of the candidates, including three women, are 
not well known. They registered, knowing beforehand that they do 
not stand a change of being elected. 
  According to their respective identification number, the 
candidates include Guillermo Aleman, Luis Eduardo Rodriguez, 
Jose Antonio Cortes, Jose Galat, Andres Pastrana, Enrique 
Parejo, Gloria Gaitan, Doris de Castro, Efrain Torres, Ernesto 
Samper, Jose Guillermo Barbosa, Alberto Mendoza, Oscar Rojas, 
Maria Diaz, Miguel Meza, Miguel Zamora, Antonio Navarro, and 
Regina Betancourt. 
  According to recent voter polls, Conservative Andres 
Pastrana 
and Liberal Ernesto Samper are both in the best position to win 
the elections. They are closely followed by former guerrilla 
Antonio Navarro Wolff, former secret police director Miguel 
Meza, and former Liberal Minister Enrique Parejo. If none of the 
candidates obtain an absolute majority of votes, which would 
seem to be the case, a second election round will take place on 
29 May between the two candidates that received the most votes.

  [Editorial Report] Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish on 16 
March publishes on page D-11 a 350-word report on student unrest 
in Lara State, and Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish on 16 March 
publishes on page 4-29 a 200-word report on student unrest in 
Maturin. The first report notes the incidents involve students 
in Barquisimeto, Lara State, who on 15 March protested the loss 
of discounted preferential student bus fares. They hijacked 
several buses and set one on fire. Unrest began at 0700 with 
students setting tires on fire, but grew increasingly violent by 
1000. Demonstrators stoned several buses and a shopping center. 
Police report that many of the demonstrators were not students, 
but infiltrated agitators. 
  The second report involves students from the Francisco 
Iznardi High School who clashed with the State Police Special 
Brigade on 15 March, also over bus fares. Police used tear gas 
to try and disperse the mob who hurled stones. According to 
witnesses, these were the most violent clashes ever seen in this 
city. Additionally, there was a transportation strike called 
for by the unions, which prevented hundreds of people from 
riding buses to work. The Mayor's Office reportedly has not 
replied to a request for a 15-bolivar fare hike. Students have 
stated that the student half fare must be maintained otherwise 
they will continue the unrest in Maturin.

Cuba explain the guerrilla summit, Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina has said that Colombia must understand the world 
lives a different reality and the Cuban Government understands 
that this reality implies that guerrilla groups cannot be 
supported. Governments have established the conditions for the 
disappearance of those groups and Cuba abides by and respects 
those rules. 
  The Cuban Government has reiterated that there was no 
guerrilla summit in Havana last January. Someone wants to hurt 
our good relations, Cuban Ambassador Jesus Martinez said in 
Santa Fe de Bogota. Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin said 
it is too early to talk about breaking relations with Cuba. She 
reiterated that the Colombian Government is waiting for Havana's 
reply. Monsignior Nel Beltran, who was quite offended, has 
reaffirmed that he has never been in Havana and added that he 
will sue EL TIEMPO newspaper for slander.

between the two countries. Minutes before Robaina's visit, 
Nguyen Manh Cam told PRENSA LATINA that the traditional ties of

boost in the last 18 months. 
  Robaina said that his trip to Vietnam was not only an 
unavoidable duty, but an enormous satisfaction because of the 
existing friendship between the two peoples and the desire to 
improve on cooperative trade and all other possible areas. 
  Tomorrow, the Cuban delegation will hold a series of 
meetings 
with Dau Ngoc Xuan, chairman of the state Cooperation and 
Investment Committee, and the ministers of agriculture, the food 
industry, and commerce and tourism.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Pedro Otero from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Excerpt] A few days ago, U.S. President William Clinton 
called for a summit meeting of American chiefs of state in 
Miami, Florida. He excluded Cuba from that invitation 
considering that Cuba does not meet the democratic requirements 
Washington has set for the rest of the area countries. So there 
will be a meeting without Cuba, the rebel member of the 
community. 
  Curiously, the call for a summit ignores the OAS, which 
because of its nature and purposes should be the one to promote 
such a summit, and ignoring them calls attention to a certain 
degree of speed and improvisation. 
  It has been said that the meeting will be on democracy, 
cooperation, and economy. In my opinion, this is an effort aimed 
at intruding in Iberio-American summit meetings or, at least, 
reducing the possibility of these summits working for unity and 
regional cooperation. 
  There is no doubt the Miami meeting has untrustworthy 
objectives. The United States tried to get invited to the first 
summit meeting of Ibero-American presidents in Guadalajara, 
Mexico, in 1991. It did not achieve its objective but it 
maintained its desire to be kept officially informed of what was 
discussed there. I do not know if it tried to do the same at the 
other summits, in Spain and Brazil. The White House has 
diminished the importance of what the Ibero-American chiefs of 
state said. What is clear is that the current call is aimed at 
reducing the significance of this movement, which will hold its 
fourth summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, in June. 
  Once again Washington is marshalling its ability to try to 
divide our people with plans and projects that have nothing to 
do with our regional problems. We have been fooled for decades 
with dreams about development and well-being. Now, on the 
threshold of the 21st century, we are being told the same 
stories we were told last century to try and keep us separated. 
U.S. economic and military power has always obstructed Latin 
America's fair aspirations for unity. 
  At the Guadalajara summit, President Fidel Castro expressed 
caution about the so-far useless efforts to become an 
economically powerful and politically united community in spite 
of our huge resources and talent. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Havana, 19 Mar (DPA) -- A delegation from the Social 
Democratic Party of the German region of Hessen, led by deputy 
Joachim Tappae, arrived today in Santiago de Cuba to implement a 
broad information exchange program. The official national news 
agency said the mission led by a presidency member of the second 
largest political party in the Federal Republic of Germany will 
meet with top authorities of the Santiago de Cuba Province, 
located some 950 km east of Havana. 
  Tappae, who is also a member of the German Bundestag 
(parliament), told the media that during his one-week visit to 
Cuba, he will seek to obtain firsthand knowledge of the Cuban 
situation after changes in the world. He pointed out that he is 
especially interested in exploring the possibility of increasing 
political ties between northern Hessen and Santiago de Cuba. 
According to Tappae, although northern Hessen and Santiago de 
Cuba are physically distant from each other, they share some 
similarities in their historic backgrounds and various economic 
activities. 
  The agenda includes touring production, cultural, 
scientific, 
and recreative centers, a visit to the mining community of El 
Cobre, which is one of the oldest in Cuba, as well as meetings 
with government and political authorities.

  [Text] The important Cuba-Netherlands bilateral meeting for 
trade relations began in this capital today at the Hotel 
Comodoro at 1500. I say important meeting because the 
businessmen from the Netherlands are accompanied by a trade 
mission from 22 companies, which will study at first hand the 
possibilities of investing in the construction of waterworks and 
port facilities, in the textile industry, and in food products. 
Also present are representatives from important financial banks 
and legal assistance. According to the chairman of the Dutch 
party, Wuliam Want Waut [identified by caption], the objective 
is to activate this group after years of regrettable immobility. 
  [Begin Wuliam Want Waut recording, in English with 
superimposed translation into Spanish] The only problem is that 
they need time. This is a characteristic of the Dutch. They need 
time to study things in depth. However, we expect very good 
results from this visit. [end recording] 
  The Netherlands is an important trading partner for Cuba, 
one 
whose exchange value over the past three years exceeded $50 
million; they have, in Cuba, such prestigious companies as 
Castrol, and they trade in areas as vital as nickel. Indeed, 
thanks to the work of this bilateral group, a Dutch bank 
extended credit to Cuba's nickel and sugar industries, although 
Cuban representative (Ariel Maso) says there are other fields, 
too. 
  This group will be making bilateral contacts until Friday 
[25 
March], when the individual and collective results of the 
negotiations will be learned. Businessmen from both countries 
can rely on a market that is needful and almost virgin and, in 
addition, has the corresponding financing -- apparently all the 
links to allow the economy to benefit. 
  [Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 0000 GMT on 22 
March says in a similar report: "Some 20 businessmen make up the 
Netherlands trade mission which today began exchanges aimed at 
identifying the host's new interests that might be attractive to 
the visitors. Marta Camacho, secretary general of the Chamber of 
Commerce of the Republic of Cuba, welcomed the delegation, which 
is headed by (Juan F. Stor), former Netherlands ambassador to

<F P=106> [Interview with Carlos Alberto Montaner, chairman of Cuban </F>
opposition organization, by Martin Ehl in Madrid; date not 
given: "Castro's Obstinacy Is an Obstacle"] 
  [Text] "The Cuban opposition, both abroad and at home, is 
very fragmented. The first step in Cuba's transition from a 
totalitarian regime will be the unification of all opposition 
forces," Carlos Alberto Montaner, chairman of the Cuban Liberal 
Union in Exile and head of the influential dissident 
organization Democratic Platform, told a group of Czech 
reporters in an interview. Montaner has been living in exile 
since the age of 18, and currently works as a journalist and 
translator in Spain. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Could you briefly describe the situation of 
the Cuban opposition? 
  [Montaner] We expect fundamental changes in Cuba. The 
regime is trying to survive at the cost of constantly 
intensifying repressions. The opposition is attempting to find 
a peaceful solution that would lead to talks and free elections. 
The authorities continue, however, to persecute the dissidents. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Could you say what is the stand of the 
Democratic Platform regarding the person of Jorge Mas Canosa 
(leader of a strong right-wing exile organization in the United 
States -- LIDOVE NOVINY note)? 
  [Montaner] Mas Canosa represents a group that does not 
believe in a peaceful solution to the situation in Cuba, and 
expects that the change will be accompanied by acts of violence 
against the regime. That certainly is very dangerous because it 
could lead to a civil war that would completely devastate the 
country. 
  The main difference between us is that we endeavor to talk 
with Castro's government and seek a political solution. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Do you get any help from the international 
community? 
  [Montaner] Yes. There is a group of Christian democrats and 
a group of social democrats in our Liberal Union. They both 
maintain contacts with the international centers of their 
respective movements. 
  We have encountered great understanding and help in the 
postcommunist countries, also in the Czech Republic, which, as a 
former communist state, knows what it means to have a communist 
government. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] What are the main obstacles in Cuba's 
transition to democracy? 
  [Montaner] First of all, it is Castro's obstinacy. He 
created a dictatorship and is now attempting to change it into a 
Chinese-type regime, wherein the capitalist economy is 
controlled by the communists. For a number of reasons, however, 
what works in China has no chance of success in Cuba. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Do you really believe that the fundamental 
changes that await Cuba can be implemented by peaceful means? 
  [Montaner] Before 1989, we believed that a peaceful 
transition was impossible. The changes in Central Europe, which 
transpired without bloodshed, gave us hope that the Cuban 
transformation could take a similar course. The only possible 
way is a dialogue with the opposition. If it was possible in 
your country, Poland, and Hungary, why not in Cuba? 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] If a violent coup took place after all, 
would the United States intervene? 
  [Montaner] I am convinced it would. If a civil war took 
place, the United States would be interested in an intervention. 
It certainly would result in an international conflict. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] What will be the priorities of the first 
Cuban postcommunist government and how much time is needed to 
reform the country? 
  [Montaner] The first democratic government should orientate 
itself toward the market and democracy. As far as the reforms 
are concerned, it will depend on political consensus. If the 
fundamental political agreements are reached, within four to 
five years the new Cuban Government can overcome the worst 
difficulties. The situation in the country is so bad that 
whatever happens, it will be an improvement. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] How can one explain that Castro remains in 
power despite the current catastrophic situation? 
  [Montaner] In Cuba, we are talking about a combination of 
the communist regime and a standard Latin American Caudillism, a 
dictatorship. The Latin American dictatorships usually endure 
for a long time, just look at Paraguay, for instance. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] A year ago, you said in an interview that a 
change will take place in Cuba within a year. The truth is 
different. So, when will the change take place? 
  [Montaner] At this time, I cannot say. It is difficult for 
a politician to predict. Perhaps, we could consult an 
astrologist. 
  The estimates differ, it could take three or four years.

  [Text] Army General Raul Castro Ruz, second secretary of 
the Communist Party of Cuba and Revolutionary Armed Forces 
minister, presided over the Minfar's [Ministry of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces] expanded military council, at which 
a final assessment was made of all the activities carried out 
during 1993 by the three armies and of all the weapons that 
defend the national territory. This account led to the 
conclusion that a gigantic and fruitful effort had been made, 
which shows that the capabilities and combat readiness of our 
Armed Forces have been strengthened. 
  Another important point analyzed was the FAR's 
[Revolutionary 
Armed Forces] agricultural-livestock activity toward the goal of 
supplying all the troops with food; a 30-percent increase toward 
achieving this objective is expected this year. 
  During the Minfar's expanded military council, on the 
occasion of his 50th anniversary as a combat pilot, Enrique 
Carrera [last name as heard], hero of the Republic of Cuba, was 
promoted to the rank of division general.

<F P=106> [Article by Rosa Miriam Elizalde and Amado del Pino] </F>
  [Excerpts] Working from their rank and file organizations, 
the party and UJC [Union of Young Communists] are waging a hard 
fight against the corruption and demoralization that are 
starting to flourish in the current situation. JUVENTUD REBELDE 
presents today's debate on prostitution and hustling. 
  The packed bus stop is right across from the house, but that 
is not where she will go for her night out. Somewhere else her 
"friends" await--leaving other homes, crossing other thresholds, 
leaving behind other families--to pair up or proceed separately 
to a foreseeable destination, beginning the game that takes them 
away from commitments, the daily routine, clean, everyday love. 
  She adopts a theatrical pose and signals to a taxi for 
tourists. She is lucky: A hand opens the back door and someone 
makes room. The first glance seems to put her in her place as if 
she were one more object among the cheap goods, as if one could 
guess the vignettes that every element of her attire could tell. 
The blouse, for example, would tell of the double she drank in a 
hotel bar; her shoes the screech of tires skidding to a halt; 
the other items words not understood and loveless nights that 
have gradually filled the clothes rack in her room. 
<H5>  Parallel Histories </H5>
  A number of myths are collapsing. Evidence of prostitution 
does not mean that the anecdotes, the motives, the interests of 
this notoriously unstable group that frequents a number of the 
capital's streets and tourist zones fit together into one whole. 
  After weeks of research and many interviews with persons 
involved or connected with it, we discovered that the topic is 
far broader and more complex than appearances might suggest. Not 
all the prostitution afflicting us fits the most common 
definition of the term precisely, nor can it be categorized 
under the picturesque label of "hustling" 
jineterismo, a word in widespread use in Cuba that 
apparently comes from Mexican popular speech and describes the 
activities of those who make a profit in an improper or 
exploitive way. 
  Nor is it organically linked to the form of tourism most 
commonly seen here, the type that arrives on "package" tours 
with a schedule organized ahead of time. Although it can also be 
seen in this connection, it tends to proliferate in highly 
singular, specific sectors, with a preference for temporary 
residents in Cuba. Estela, one of those interviewed, explained 
why: 
  (She is 18 but looks older under her makeup. She is 
dark-skinned and has a slinky, provocative walk. In the dazzling 
noonday sun, she wears a brightly colored, very low-cut dress.) 
"You don't go out with just anyone who comes along. For example, 
a man who stops on 5th Avenue is nearly always someone who has 
been in Cuba for some time, who comes and goes freely, who 
sometimes even has business here. The ones who come on 
excursions are generally penniless, and since they have a set 
program, they do not have time and are not interested in looking 
for a woman to spend time with." 
  Neither Estela nor the others become prostitutes to meet 
pressing economic needs. The study done by the JUVENTUD REBELDE 
research team reveals that these persons sell their bodies to 
buy whatever strikes their eye, luxuries, things like trips, 
clothes, cosmetics, shoes. They sometimes do so with the 
complicity of workers at the tourist complexes they frequent. 
  It would be erroneous to view the phenomenon in political 
terms. Only two women openly expressed a desire to leave the 
country. The rest of those interviewed merely want to have a 
good time and buy things they cannot find on the market. They 
want to satisfy a consumer need awakened by the movies, 
distorted education, a pattern of happiness that makes material 
things a cult. Prostitution here borders on the ethical. It is 
the demoralization of a minority on the threshold of or within 
the confines of crime and that tries to monopolize relations 
with foreign visitors. 
  One also observes a certain somewhat caricaturish 
reproduction of the structure of classic prostitution. However, 
most of the persons interviewed are not connected with pimps, or 
with the somewhat ghostly "houses." Estela is the exception 
among the women who spoke to the newspaper: 
  "I began about a year ago. In the eleventh grade, I fell in 
love and dropped out of school. Then I got bored with the 
relationship and started going to bed with anyone that appealed 
to me. I met Julian, who told me about the business with 
foreigners and who initially made my `dates' for me. However, 
they caught him selling clothes from the `shopping center' and 
threw him in jail. Now I am `helping' him!" 
  JUVENTUD REBELDE interviewed several dozen persons picked at 
random from among those "in the business." Their ages range from 
18 to 25. We interviewed 33 of them at length. They have all 
completed at least ll years of schooling and many have an 
"intermediate" technical education. One girl has a degree in 
accounting and finance. 
  While they have highly diverse backgrounds and experience, 
the group shares a lack of vision of the future. Very few give 
much thought to the risks involved or are troubled by the 
prospect of what they do. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  No Set Price </H5>
  The rate changes and varies. JUVENTUD REBELDE learned that 
one young woman said she set a price for her "work," while 
another, a procuress, demands at least $30 from her "girls" or 
the equivalent in kind (clothing, jewelry, shoes, and so on, 
whose prices at stores for tourists she knows well!). However, 
in general, there is no set price, nor is one thought out in 
advance. 
  The middleman--a specimen also existing in this 
milieu--usually hikes up the price of the "goods" when dealing 
with a foreigner. All the women interviewed said the same thing, 
although they also said they are not taken advantage of. 
[passage omitted] 
  The belief that this type of prostitution is very cheap is 
rather deceptive. Having sexual relations in exchange for a cute 
child, for example, would amount to economic suicide in Spain or 
France or exoticism in extremely poor taste. The high cost of 
living even inflates the price of love for money. 
  However, in Cuba, with an economy that gives priority to the 
basic needs of the population, shortages on the market and crime 
that imposes exorbitant prices on the black market substantially 
raise the real worth of the "presents" on which our specific 
type of prostitution is based. Someone acquiring a pair of shoes 
and a blouse might be earning in a matter of hours the 
equivalent in money of several months of professional wages! 
  In addition, one is struck by the fact that JUVENTUD 
REBELDE's informants come from families whose economic level is 
far above the national average published by the State Statistics 
Committee. 
  The results also suggest that the practice of prostitution 
in 
the capital does not coincide with other very isolated and 
primitive forms of selling sex included in other studies. The 
women we interviewed do not come from homes characterized by a 
criminal or antisocial atmosphere. They do not even come from 
homes with crammed or precarious living conditions. 
  The lack of any systematic elements is the very reason why 
this group is so unstable. The frequency of relations varies 
quite a bit, to the point where it becomes difficult to find 
anyone engaging in them on a daily basis. Our research showed 
that those engaging in the "hunt" for foreigners do so three or 
four times a week, basically from Friday to Sunday. The rest do 
so two or three times a month. 
  Over 60 percent of them work or go to school and not a 
single 
one is forced to engage in prostitution in order to eat every 
day or have a roof over her head every night. Nevertheless, one 
observes a trend of going from the purely "vocational" practice 
of prostitution to making it a way of life. [passage omitted] 
  What about their families? Their social environment? With 
what concealed complicity does this environment spread? 
  The family was present in nearly all interviews, explicit in 
some and by omission in others. For most, the home is not 
removed from or totally oblivious to the going out, type of 
company, and gifts that many of these young women do not hide. 
Only three of the women interviewed said they engaged in 
prostitution unknown to the family and only two were seriously 
worried about being discovered. All exhibited marked evidence of 
having grown up with deficiencies in their upbringing resulting 
in being dazzled by material things and a search for easy 
economic benefits. 
<H5>  Law of the Body </H5>
  The hardening and alienation typical of these young people 
as 
they increasingly engage in such relations is alarming. They all 
separate sexual activity from any sentiment even remotely 
connected with love. Bitterness and even cruelty mark arguments 
over the issue and some, who also confess their experiences with 
no reserve whatsoever, speak of prostitution as "a profession 
like any other." [passage omitted] 
  What is sad is that no longer can she tell who is a friend 
and who simply wants to use her. She is not happy and stopped 
being happy long ago. Anyone who takes up this type of life 
becomes hollow inside and loses the ability to love, believing 
that love has to be repressed because it is an ugly, inhuman 
world. The enchantment of life turns into distrust. 
<H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5>
<H5>  Sowing Shame </H5>
  Confronted with certain views, many would say we have no 
other choice but to resign ourselves once and for all to the 
"girls" who go around holding up aging tourists, as our 
colleague Soledad Cruz learned while writing this piece. One 
even hears with some frequency the tolerant apology, the 
conformist indulgence toward those who throng to our hotels and 
thoroughfares, trading sex for dollars. 
  There are even those who take the ostrich attitude, 
suggesting that prostitution be assigned a street in Havana that 
is less popular than Fifth Avenue, a practice followed in most 
of the world's cities. It is a hypocritical theory, a kind of 
duplicity that would lump us together painfully with those who 
practice it. 
  Fortunately for us, we continue to use the exact same 
definition of "prostitution" given by the dictionary. It is what 
it is: debasement, vile use made of a thing, rather than a sign 
of modernity and free sexual expression by which some would try 
to justify it. These are the very people who forget that we were 
once the victims of it, that Cuba was the great prostitute of 
the Caribbean and, whether they want to admit it or not, 
following the Revolution, that there was not a single district 
where it was tolerated or a single woman who had to sell herself 
in order to eat. 
  That is still the case. Our prostitution is notoriously one 
of a kind. This is probably the only place on earth where it is 
practiced for the sole purpose of enjoying luxuries. The 
romantic world of La Dame aux Camelias or those poor creatures 
who in so much good and bad literature alike debased love just 
to survive is totally foreign to those practicing the so-called 
"oldest profession in the world" in this country. 
  This is borne out by the research done by JUVENTUD REBELDE 
over a period of months, by interviews with dozens of persons 
who frequent the milieu and who admit selling themselves to 
anyone willing to pay and without feeling anything remotely 
connected with love. 
  Although the motives of those engaging in prostitution are 
not all the same--there is evidence of family abandonment, the 
practices of teenagers seeking the recognition of peer 
groups--there is a general moral and human deterioration among 
these persons who, in addition to viewing life with deep 
cynicism, feel no inherent need for virtue, dignity, or decorum. 
  They are afflicted with an absence of values and even though 
the malady is grave--even incurable in many practitioners--it is 
not something that we have to resign ourselves to tolerating 
permanently. Nor does the fact that it now exists in proportions 
difficult to measure, threatening in certain sectors to 
monopolize relations with foreigners, mean that we must tolerate 
it, much less give our blessings to it. We even believe it is 
possible to cure it, to stop its spread in time. 
  Moving toward austerity, goodness, honesty, and decency, 
viewed as discretion and nobility of customs, is not enough if 
the family and our surroundings, our centers of work and study, 
do not harshly penalize such forms of conduct. 
  Without turning into policemen of sexual mores, without 
turning to castrating morality, it is time to say what we think, 
time to call such attitudes by their real name and--in an 
attempt to to duck the issue--stop hiding behind the country's 
situation or the equally hypocritical phrase that "everyone is 
free to do with his/her body what he/she wishes," as if both 
things pardoned the vanity, selfishness, ambition, and criminal 
result of such an attitude. 
  It is a fact that the economic depression catalyzed the 
phenomenon, but the "bad seed" already existed. Its origins lie 
in the home which worships trash and needs great ostentation to 
conceal the internal vacuum. How else is one to interpret the 
fact that all the persons interviewed by JUVENTUD REBELDE have 
decent homes, their families have a living income, some even 
work and earn a good wage and yet, it is not enough! 
  In the face of all this, we still have to defend staunchly 
one's enjoyment of the human body, the freedom to love, a 
freedom that neither needs nor demands payment, one that thrives 
without betrayal of the soul. In a country that freed itself 
from it, why take on that shameful spectacle of Fifth Avenue and 
other streets of Havana crowded with this new breed of 
prostitutes? 
  It is not irrelevant to recall the tradition of the tribe of 
Amazon women that once baffled a famous novelist: Living without 
identity was the sanction imposed on the women who traded their 
favors for crystal beads and fake feathers. They could not paint 
themselves with the solar signs or colored stripes that were the 
secular guarantee of dignity and beauty. Without a face to show, 
without any personal traits with which to worship the gods, they 
were no one. They had only their shame.

  [Text] Dr. Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, chief of the UN Mission 
for El Salvador (Onusal), said that "El Salvador should feel 
proud about its elections." The Onusal chief and his large team 
of observers toured the entire country on 19 and 20 March. 
Ramirez added that they had access to the latest information on 
what was transpiring "and, therefore, this was an 
extraordinarily normal election." 
  Ramirez described as "a Solomonic measure" the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal [TSE] decision to install polling stations in 
Arcatao, San Jose las Flores, Nueva Trinidad, and San Isidro 
Labrador, because these four municipalities of Chalatenenango 
are considered to be refugees for former FMLN [Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front] combatants. 
  The voting started in those places at 1015 because ballot 
boxes were not transported until yesterday via Air Force 
helicopters after the TSE had a change of mind. The original 
plan was to install all ballot boxes in the city of 
Chalatenango, where 85 percent of the inhabitants of those four 
municipalities live. 
  Ramirez praised Salvadorans who stood in line without making 
any fuss to comply with their duties as citizens. He regretted 
delays in the voting process that prevented many people from 
voting. [as published] 
  The chief observer, of Colombian origin, recalled the 
commitment made by presidential candidates and secretaries 
general to President Cristiani to close polling stations at 1700 
only after every citizen still waiting to vote had cast his or 
her vote. 
  Ramirez said that Onusal will take note of all "anomalies, 
claims, and requests but will only report worthy ones. The 
atmosphere that has surrounded the peace process is yielding and 
will yield results," the chief of the observers added. 
  Among the small problems he noticed at certain voting sites 
were the delays in opening. In some cases, such as the Central 
American Pavillion of the International Fair Grounds, Ramirez 
intervened directly to expedite its opening. "In general, this 
was an extraordinarily normal election," the Colombian added.

  [Text] Salvadorans woke up today without knowing the final 
results of Sunday's general elections and with the expectation 
of a runoff election to choose the new president. More than 63 
percent of the votes have been tallied and the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal [TSE] reported that the ruling Nationalist Republican 
Alliance, ARENA, with a right-wing tendency, and its candidate, 
Armando Calderon Sol, have failed to achieve an absolute 
majority, although they lead the count with 49.6 percent. 
  Calderon Sol's closest rival, Ruben Zamora, leader of the 
leftist coalition that includes the former Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front guerrilla groups, obtained 26.6 
percent. The Christian Democratic Party continues in third 
place. Its candidate, Fidel Chavez Mena, has received 15 percent 
of the votes. He is followed by the conservative National 
Conciliation Party, which chose Roberto Escobar Garcia as its 
candidate and which received only 4.5 percent of the votes. 
  The other parties that participated in the elections -- 
Authentic Christian Movement, a center-right party, and the 
evangelical parties, the Unity Movement and the National 
Solidarity Movement -- have smaller percentages. 
  TSE preliminary results indicate more than 49.92 percent of 
Salvadorans abstained from demonstrating their sympathy for a 
given political party. These results are similar to the polls 
conducted by various organizations at the national level. The 
results indicate an average of 40 percent of the population did 
not express their preference. The figures, however, might change 
as the tally of votes from Sunday's general elections continues.

  [Text] Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] preliminary results 
support statements made by the ruling party's candidate, who 
said he would win the elections the first time around, but the 
opposition candidate insists there is no absolute winner and 
added there will be need for a runoff elections. Preliminary 
figures gave the advantage to the ruling Nationalist Republican 
Alliance, ARENA, and in a news conference, ARENA candidate 
Armando Calderon Sol said preliminary results clearly indicate a 
tendency favoring his party. 
  [Begin Calderon recording] In compliance with the agreement 
I 
signed, I cannot declare myself the winner, the victor at this 
time of the night. I respect the pledge I took. [end recording] 
  Calderon Sol cautiously said TSE figures have given him the 
victory in the first round. 
  [Begin Calderon recording] TSE figures, the vote tally, have

will be runoff elections, and that is not so. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate for the 
leftist coalition supported by the former Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front [FMLN], said projections show the need 
for runoff elections. Zamora said the fact it will be necessary 
to hold runoff elections represents a defeat for the ruling 
party, ARENA. He also announced the beginning of a battle for 
electoral purity. 
  [Begin Zamora recording] We are hereby beginning the battle 
for electoral purity in the runoff elections to make sure all 
the Salvadorans can vote in the runoff elections so we do not 
have to face what happened today. Because of TSE's critical 
deficiencies, thousands of Salvadorans were excluded from 
exercising their right to vote; thousands of them could not 
exercise that right because they were not included on the list; 
because they had a voter registration card but did not appear in 
the lists; or because their numbers were changed in the lists. 
Therefore, when they arrived to vote another person had 
exercised their right to vote. [end recording] 
  If Zamora's charges are confirmed, the runoff elections 
should be held in April. Approximately 2.3 million Salvadorans 
registered to vote but the FMLN insisted there were serious 
irregularities in the process, for example, people who 
registered and failed to receive their voter registration card.

  [Text] There will definitely be a runoff election, a 
high-ranking magistrate of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE], 
who requested anonymity, confirmed to YSU. [Words indistinct] 
handed to YSU, ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] only 
garnered 49.8 percent of the vote. Thus, there will be a runoff 
election. This is virtually official [words indistinct] TSE 
magistrates. ARENA announced a news conference to be held in a 
few moments. 
  We want to underscore that this runoff election will 
reportedly be held in late April, probably the last Sunday of 
April, on 24 April. The magistrate also told YSU that the 
official vote count will start tomorrow, and a runoff election 
for late April will not be called until an official announcement 
of the results is made. 
  We repeat, there will be a runoff election. [Words 
indistinct] a TSE magistrate confirmed to YSU. The vote count 
as of 1359 [1959 GMT] performed by the company the TSE hired 
showed the following results: ARENA, 494,255 votes or 49.26 
percent; Democratic Convergence-Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front-National Revolutionary Movement [CD-FMLN-MNR] 
Coalition, 256,746 votes or 25.59 percent; Authentic Christian 
Movement, 8,200 votes or 0.81 percent. Everything indicates this 
party will definitely disappear. Unity Movement, 23,759 votes 
or 2.36 percent; National Solidarity Movement, 9,905 votes or 
0.98 percent -- this party will probably survive -- National 
Conciliation Party, PCN, 50,572 votes or 5.04 percent; and the 
Christian Democratic Party, 159,790 votes or 15.92 percent as of 
1400 [2000 GMT]. So far, 73.06 percent of the votes have been 
counted. There was an absentee rate of 47.18 percent. So far 
5,103 voting table boards have been counted, and 1,684 are still 
pending. Everything seems to indicate there will be a runoff 
election, as a TSE magistrate told YSU. 
  The last runoff election took place in 1984 when the late 
President Jose Napoleon Duarte disputed the Presidency with the 
late Major Roberto D'Aubuisson. On that occasion the first 
election was held in March and the runoff election in May 1984. 
It is happening again, but ARENA is not in the opposition. It 
is the ruling party, and will face the CD-FMLN-MNR Coalition. 
Preparations will start tomorrow and the TSE [words indistinct] 
throughout Easter, the magistrate who requested anonymity told 
YSU.

<F P=106> [Report by Elder Gomez on interview with Armando Calderon </F>
Sol, presidential candidate for the Nationalist Republican 
Alliance, from El Presidente Hotel in San Salvador on 21 March 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Gomez] A few minutes ago Armando Calderon Sol, 
candidate for the Nationalist Republican Alliance, ARENA, held a 
news conference in which he did not rule out the possibility of 
participating in a runoff election. Calderon Sol did not 
dismiss the possibility either of negotiating with the 
opposition regarding the suspension of the runoff elections, 
which would be held on 24 April. 
  [Begin recording] [Calderon] We have seen this done in other 
countries. It is no secret. We hope that the opposition will 
have second thoughts about this. We think a situation of this 
sort would be more beneficial for the country. There would be 
less polarization. We could say this would allow us to overcome 
electoral problems. As I told you we are proud to have three 
hundred and some thousand more -- almost (?350,000) more votes 
-- than our closest contender. 
  [Gomez] What do you think could have influenced the fact 
that 
your party was not elected in the primary elections. 
  [Calderon] On the contrary. I think it was a victory for the 
party. The election results give us a marvelous victory. 
ARENA's triumph is total and absolute. I think we have been 
favored by the majority vote and by the vote of the Salvadoran 
people. I would say that it has been a premium vote by the 
people who trust in their leaders, a premium vote for a good 
government which fulfilled a good government program with a good 
electoral campaign. Proof of this is that we are transforming El 
Salvador and we have begun modernizing El Salvador. Proof of 
this is the fact that those who had never participated are 
participating. We are building a new El Salvador. [end 
recording] 
  [Gomez] The Supreme Electoral Tribunal announced this 
afternoon the possibility of holding runoff elections 24 April, 
because none of the nine political parties that participated in 
the 20 March elections obtained 50 percent plus one of the votes 
cast on Sunday. Calderon Sol said that if a runoff election is 
scheduled, ARENA will speak with all the political and social 
forces of the country which have always accompanied him. He 
complained about the problems in the voting process and 
attributed them to the bureaucracy imposed on the voters by the 
TSE.

  [Text] Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate of the 
ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA], hoped the left 
will reflect in the face of his undisputed victory and decline 
to participate in a runoff election to prevent further 
polarization in the country. In many countries--and this is no 
secret--other forces decline to concede to the majority party, 
Calderon Sol stated during a news conference this evening at a 
Salvadoran hotel. The ARENA candidate insisted, however, he is 
still awaiting the official results of the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal [TSE] on Sunday's general elections, in which he 
claimed he received 300,000 votes more than his opponent, Ruben 
Zamora of the leftist coalition. Calderon Sol also affirmed 
ARENA has won over 200 municipalities out of the country's 262 
and the majority in the 84-seat assembly. The former San 
Salvador mayor said the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front and its allies, the Democratic Convergence and the 
National Revolutionary Movement, have an electoral ceiling of 25 
percent. After describing the coalition as a leftist potpourri 
of all tastes and flavors, he acknowledged it represents a 
segment of society; in this respect, he said, this coalition 
will play a role, have the right to participate, and can be a 
democratic opposition. We hope it can. 
  He described as a crass plot the reports by certain sectors 
of his alleged ties with death squads, which he vowed to fight 
when he consolidates himself as the winner of the elections and 
takes office. He added he will support the inquiries on the 
groups the Joint Group has been conducting since last May and 
that he will request the cooperation of the Spanish police, the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Scotland Yard. 
  Commenting on the elections, he termed it a wonderful civic 
holiday, adding if there is a runoff election, the TSE must 
resolve the irregularities that took place in the electoral 
registry and the organization of the elections. If we have a 
runoff, we have to demand the TSE better organize the elections, 
as the TSE must assess the problems that arose and ensure a 
large voter turnout. 
  According to the UN Observers for El Salvador, Onusal, close 
to 25,000 Salvadorans were unable to vote, because their names 
did not appear on the electoral lists. It also reported there 
were other minor incidents.

  [Text] Supreme Electoral Tribunal President Luis Arturo 
Zaldivar has noted that the initial results of Sunday's 
elections indicate a runoff election for president and vice 
president likely will be held within a month: 
  [Begin Zaldivar recording] There is an undeniable trend and 
everything seems to indicate there will be a presidential runoff 
election. The other elections will stand because it is [word 
indistinct] constitutional. At this time, current trends lead 
us to think there will be a runoff. I insist (?we do) what the 
law states -- namely, hold a runoff election. [end recording] 
  Zaldivar admitted that there were shortcomings in the 
balloting process, but he added that these will be corrected in 
the future to guarantee and improve similar electoral events: 
  [Begin Zaldivar recording] For example, the voting did not 
start at the time mandated by law. Many polling stations opened 
after 0700. This happened because this was the first time in 
the nation's history that the entire political spectrum was 
involved in one general election. Everyone wanted to serve as 
either president or secretary of the voting table boards. 
Delays were prompted by discussions along these lines among 
people who, according to the law, represented the various 
political parties. In some places, voting started after the 
scheduled time; nevertheless, everything settled down later, and 
I think everyone who wanted to vote did vote. [end recording] 
  Dr. Zaldivar pointed out that if there is indeed a runoff, 
steps will be taken to avert the same logistical problems 
encountered in Sunday's elections.

  [Text] Masked men who were accompanying National University 
Dean Fabio Castillo Figueroa seized Finance Ministry offices in 
Tres Torres and held employees hostage for several hours. The 
group of masked men, brandishing sticks and stones, positioned 
themselves at the Ministry gates and prevented people who were 
paying their taxes and making other transactions in the morning 
of 16 March from exiting. 
  Castillo Figueroa and a group of bullies entered the 
facilities in search of Finance Minister Edwin Sagrera to demand 
an increase in the the National University allotment, but 
Sagrera was not in his office at the time. The criminals said 
that they would stay in the area holding employees and private 
citizens hostage until the minister returned to discuss the 
problem. Many women feared that something serious was going to 
happen and fled through a small fence, leaving their purses and 
other possessions on the premises. 
  National Police riot officers moved to the site in order to 
protect public property. The police presence prompted the 
masked men to draw the weapons they had been hiding and begin 
provoking the officers, who were staying several meters away. 
  Several vehicles belonging to UN Observers for El Salvador 
members were parked at the main entrance as though to protect 
the masked men, who refused to let the employees and private 
citizens leave. 
  Castillo Figueroa told the officers: "There will not be any 
problems, we have control over the youths." Moments later the 
riot police left the site, and the masked men remained inside 
the building.

  [Text] Santiago de Chile, 21 Mar (EFE) -- Brazilian 
Ambassador to Chile Guilherme Leite-Ribeiro has said that Brazil 
is still interested in signing a commercial agreement with 
Chile, although one that excludes the customs tariff issue. 
  The ambassador has thus cleared the doubts about the 
bilateral negotiations, which have been stalemated for five 
months. 
  In statements to the economic newspaper "EL DIARIO," 
Leite-Ribeiro explained that the customs tariff issue is being 
excluded because Mercosur [Common Market of the South] internal 
tariffs will be eliminated in January 1995, while Mercosur 
members will adopt a common external tariff. 
  This common tariff will modify the bilateral agreements, 
which will have to be renegotiated by Brazil, Argentina, 
Uruguay, and Paraguay, which are the four Mercosur members. 
  "It would therefore be senseless to negotiate with Chile 
over 
a tariff reduction that will last only one year," the Ambassador 
said. 
  The main obstacles in the Chilean-Brazilian negotiations 
centered around the area of services, a sector in which Brazil 
maintains a policy of restrictions that favor local enterprises. 
  In addition, some Chilean entrepreneurial sectors have 
disagreed with the treaty with Brazil, because they have no 
confidence in Brazil's macroeconomic development and because of 
the state subsidies paid to some exporters. 
  Ambassador Leite-Ribeiro said that subsidies to Brazilian 
exports were terminated three years ago, adding that the Chilean 
problem is a lack of sufficient industrial supply, while in 
those sectors where Chile has achieved a strong position, trade 
relations with the industrialized countries are privileged. 
  He recalled that Brazil has a powerful industry and that its 
exports amount to $40 billion annually, which is equivalent to 
Chile's gross domestic product. 
  Brazil is Chile's main commercial partner in Latin America. 
In 1993 Brazilian exports to Chile amounted to $1.06 billion, 
while imports stood at $407 million.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Chile monitored through 17 
March. 
  According to the Central Bank's preliminary reports, the 
Chilean trade balance registered a $33.1 million deficit in 
January, with exports at $765 million and imports at $798.1 
million. This means the negative balance has been maintained for 
the ninth consecutive month. The country's purchase rate dropped 
4.5 percent and the sales rate increased 14 percent compared 
with the same month last year, a fact that Finance Minister 
Foxley regards as "good news." (Santiago LA TERCERA DE LA HORA 
in Spanish 24 Feb 94 Economic Section p 3) 
  Evaluating the economic performance in 1989-1993, Finance 
Minister Alejandro Foxley reported on 23 February that the 
economy grew 6 percent in 1993. He noted the GDP rose from $28.1 
billion in 1989 to $43.8 billion in 1993. Investment rose from 
$6.5 billion to $11.3 billion. He said government investments 
also increased from $760 million to $1.425 billion. He explained 
that the government's savings rose from $850 million in 1989 to 
$2.2 billion in 1993. This generated a fiscal surplus that 
increased from $506 million in 1989 to $890 million last year. 
Foxley said these results led the Chilean economy to grow four 
times faster than in developed countries and three times more 
quickly when compared with Latin American countries. (Santiago 
EL MERCURIO in Spanish 24 Feb 94 pp A1, A9) 
  The National Fishing Association reported Chile exported 
1.233 million metric tons of fishing products worth $1.172 
billion in 1993, a drop of 10 percent and 9.5 percent, 
respectively, compared with the previous year, when exports were 
1.370 million metric tons valued at $1.295 billion. (Santiago EL 
MERCURIO in Spanish 28 Feb 94 pp B1, B2) 
  The National Statistics Institute, INE, reported that the 
unemployment rate was 4.8 percent from November 1993 to January 
1994, an increase of 0.3 percent compared with the previous 
quarter, and a 0.4 percent increase compared with the November 
1992-January 1993 period. The labor force totalled 5,254,200 
people, an increase of 4.4 percent compared with the same 
quarter last year. The number of employees was 5,580,000, an 
increase of 3.9 percent compared with the same quarter in 1993. 
This means that 187,290 new jobs were created. (Santiago EL 
MERCURIO in Spanish 3 Mar 94 p B10) 
  The INE reported on 2 March that the February consumer price 
index was 0.3 percent, and that the cumulative inflation rate 
for the first two months of the year was 1.3 percent, and 13.1 
percent for the past 12 months. Housing increased 1.7 percent 
and transportation and communications 0.5 percent; food dropped 
1.2 percent and clothing 1.7 percent. (Santiago EL MERCURIO in 
Spanish 3 Mar 94 pp B1, B10)

  [Text] Edna Ramos, defense attorney for Legislator Anel 
Ramirez, currently under custody in Tampa, Florida, has said her 
client is unequivocally innocent. The U.S. Government has 
accused Ramirez of conspiracy to introduce drugs into that 
country. 
  "Our client is definitely innocent. He was manipulated by 
U.S. undercover agents, and that will be corroborated in due 
time by Ivan Fisher, the attorney who is handling the case in 
the United States," Ramos has explained. 
  After stating Legislator Ramirez must not be stripped of his 
parliamentary immunity, Ramos added there is absolutely no 
documented evidence his client has committed an offense in our 
country. 
  When questioned on the fact Ramirez is being investigated 
both in the United States and in our country, Ramos said 
Panamanian law mandates when it is presumed or feared an offense 
has been committed in the country, the Attorney General's Office 
must begin an investigation. 
  "Regarding this case in particular, in which a personality 
of 
the significance of Anel Ramirez is involved, it is first 
necessary, however, for the Attorney General's Office to provide 
sufficient evidence to initiate a case. And in this process, as 
will be known later, there is really no merit. There is not 
enough juridical grounds to begin a case, an investigation. 
They have not even mentioned witnesses. Moreover, in this 
process Anel Ramirez is the only detainee," Ramos has said. 
  After explaining that her client, Anel Ramirez, did not 
deliver drugs or money, Ramos said undercover agents did 
everything. She stressed Legislator Ramirez' participation has 
not even been determined. 
  Ramos has said there are not even alleged coconspirators, as 
judges in the United States have determined. They have not been 
arrested, nor has their situation been established.

<F P=106> [Report by Manuel Alvarez Cedeno] </F>
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara is not opposed to the 
return of General Manuel Antonio Noriega's former civilian and 
military collaborators who left the country in 1990, but he 
added that they must settle pending court matters if they return. 
  Endara said: "As far as I am concerned, all Panamanians who 
left -- from former Government and Justice Minister Rodolfo 
"Popito" Chiari on down -- may return, but, if they have any 
problems with the Judicial Branch or the Attorney General's 
Office, I will not get involved in that." 
  Following Noriega's ouster, his main collaborators abandoned 
the country, and since then, some have expressed a desire to 
return, but they must face charges linked to freedom of speech 
violations, embezzlement, and even murder. 
  The president argued: "They are not in exile because of me," 
which is very different from what the former military government 
did when it exiled many of its opponents. 
  "I sympathize with all Panamanians in exile, because I was 
once forced to leave the country. As far as I am concerned, 
they can return, but if they have any cases pending with the 
Judicial Branch, I will not get involved in that," he added. 
  Those in exile include Chiari, who is accused of freedom of 
speech violations; banker Rafael Arosemena, accused of 
embezzling $6.7 million from the National Bank of Panama; and 
various military officers accused of murder and various crimes 
against the state. 
  The Democratic Revolutionary Party has said most people 
still 
in exile are being persecuted by the Endara administration. 
  Endara denies this, however, by saying, "I have sent no one 
into exile," as was done by the dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega, 
who was sentenced to 40 years in the United States for drug 
trafficking.

<F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara Galimany has filed a 
lawsuit against Jaime Padilla Beliz, editor of the newspaper EL 
SIGLO, alleging slander and libel. 
  The president has voiced his anger over a report published 
today in EL SIGLO. The report refers to statements by 
journalist and attorney Jaime Padilla Beliz who said it was 
learned the very president of the Republic was threatening one 
of the Electoral Tribunal magistrates with firing his wife from 
a position to which she was recently appointed if he rules in 
favor of Mayin Correa, Panama City mayoral candidate, in a case 
at the Electoral Tribunal. 
  [Begin recording] [Endara] I am suing him for slander, 
because it is absolutely false I threatened an Electoral 
Tribunal official with dismissals or any other measure. The 
meetings and conversations I have held with Electoral Tribunal 
officials have dealt with what the president can do to benefit 
the elections. 
  The conversations with Electoral Tribunal officials have 
been 
limited to budgetary concerns, special credits, and making their 
job easier. That is the only relationship I have maintained 
with the Electoral Tribunal magistrates. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, the fact your wife is 
also running for mayor of Panama City may create a conflict of 
interest; what is your opinion? 
  [Endara] I definitely have an interest. I am not going to 
lie and say I have no interest. I have an interest, but as 
president of the Republic I will not do anything in favor of 
that candidacy. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Jaime Padilla Beliz, EL SIGLO editor, is out of 
the country and is unavailable for comment on the president's 
lawsuit. 
  On the other hand, Endara Galimany said he met with labor 
leaders of the ports and tourism taxi association as well as 
employees of the duty-free shops to analyze the crisis generated 
by the closing of the so-called duty-free shops. 
  [Begin recording] [Endara] The solution is for them to sell 
items that interest tourists. As is known, here in Panama there 
are a series of items, electronics, calculators, radios, tape 
recorders, etc., in which tourists are especially interested. 
The import duty on these items is nearly zero, precisely to 
attract tourists. Those shops must sell items for tourists. 
[end recording] 
  The president expressed his optimism over the results of 
this 
meeting, but he did not specify when he will define the status 
of the duty-free shops.

<F P=106> ["Pact With the People" by Eduardo Vallarino, Christian </F>
Democratic Party (PDC) presidential candidate] 
  [Text] I, Eduardo Vallarino Arjona, personal identification 
card 8-196-140, PDC presidential candidate, on my behalf and 
that of the other candidates to the elective posts for our 
party, propose to the people of Panama that we hold the 
following pact. 
  Upon being elected in the 8 May elections, our government 
will implement the following in all its forms: 
  1. We will govern with honesty and efficiency and fight 
corruption in all its forms. 
  2. We will increase significantly the punishments applicable 
to kidnappers, murderers, thieves, and drug traffickers. We 
will substantially reform the judicial system so that there is 
justice and the law is enforced. 
  3. Our main effort will be centered on fighting 
malnutrition, extreme poverty, and the neglect in which our 
people live. We will give the neediest decent and affordable 
housing, whether they own or lease. We will promote economic 
growth in hand with social progress. 
  4. Land and housing allocations made by agrarian reform and 
the Housing Ministry will be given equitably to men and women to 
protect the family, and to only one of them, except in confirmed 
cases involving unwed mothers, who will be the object of our 
special attention. [sentence as published] We will protect the 
family, promote an equitable and fair treatment to women, tend 
to children's needs. 
  5. We will roll back the retirement age as soon as the 
Social Security Fund finances recover and review the amounts of 
pensions given to retirees and pensioners. 
  6. We will promote the creation of new jobs via investment 
in public works and give fiscal incentives to private companies 
so they can generate jobs. 
  7. We will continue to defend the 13th month bonus. 
  8. We will respect and pay the salary increases established 
by the law to educators, nurses, firemen, policemen, postal 
employees, and other public employees. We will review 
periodically the minimum wage of private company employees as 
Article 62 of the Constitution establishes. 
  9. We will protect the agricultural and industrial producer 
by guaranteeing the consumption of national products before 
foreign products. 
  10. We will give incentives through scholarships, rewards, 
and other stimuli to Panamanians, mostly the young, who stand 
out in sports, culture, sciences, and the arts. 
  11. We will upgrade the quality of the education system so 
students can promptly join the labor force; we will pay just 
salaries to educators and promote their professional betterment. 
  12. The Public Force will continue to be headed by civilians 
and will be trained and equipped to protect a democratic society 
and guarantee that security to all citizens. 
  13. We will ensure the reverted areas are utilized for the 
benefit of all Panamanians, not just a few. We will continue 
our historical struggle to make our canal fully Panamanian. 
  14. We will initiate the territorial delimitations to which 
the Indian peoples are entitled and provide them with the public 
services of health, housing, and education under equal 
conditions with the rest of the country; we will protect and 
defend their cultures. The San Blas reservation will be 
officially named Kuna Ayala. 
  15. We will improve and extend the services of garbage 
collection, water, electricity, telephone, and health, and at 
the same time lower their rates. 
  16. We will implement a national tourism and a port and 
maritime development plan, taking advantage of our country's 
natural beauty and geographic location for the sake of artisans, 
fishermen, merchants, and, in general, the economy of the 
Panamanian people. 
  17. We will devote special attention to the ecology by 
promoting reforestation and sustainable development. We will 
sponsor laws that foster the utilization and protection of our 
flora and fauna. 
  18. We will rescue the national road network and improve 
mass transit to give our farmers access to the market and riders 
access to their jobs and cheap, comfortable, and safe 
transportation. 
  19. We will help the men and women of rural areas obtain 
land to work and help their children have health and educational 
services and greater opportunities for a better future. 
  20. We will turn consensus, fraternization, and 
participation of our country's different political and social 
forces into institutions, as the main instrument to achieve the 
higher goals of the country outlined in this pact. 
  Approved by the PDC National Political Committee on 17 March 
1994.

<F P=106> [Editorial entitled: The Appointment of a Minister Without </F>
Portfolio] 
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara Galimany confounded 
public opinion several weeks ago with the announcement he had 
proceeded to appoint Mr. Roberto Aleman as minister without 
portfolio. The presidential decision was immediately understood 
as a political solution aimed at pleasing a party that had 
recently decided to join the new government alliance. After the 
announcement all sorts of controversies have risen in the 
country's political and legal circles. 
  A decision which in the beginning seems to have originated 
as 
the result of the new government election coalition has now 
turned into a real conflict in which all sorts of legal theories 
have developed. As a consequence of this situation, the National 
Assembly Board of Directors has proceeded to deem President 
Endara's appointment as unconstitutional before the Supreme 
Court of Justice. As a result of the National Assembly's 
position, President Endara has said he has ample authority to 
carry out this or any other appointment he may seem fit. 
Nevertheless, in short, the national Constitution is quite 
clear with respect to the distribution of duties between 
ministers of state. First of all, it demands the existence of a 
law. No one can deny the president's right, granted by the 
Constitution, to carry out the appointment of ministers of 
state. Likewise, it is also true that right is in effect when 
the National Assembly has approved the establishment of the 
position and apportions sufficient funds as part of the nation's 
income and expense budget. 
  President Endara's supposed freedom to appoint officials as 
established in Paragraph One of Article 178 of the Constitution, 
supporting grounds of that appointment, is not enough, not even 
given an analysis of budgetary and personnel administration 
regulations. Much less is it justified prior to an electoral 
period. 
  If after four years of government for whatever reason the 
president decided the creation of a new position in the state 
bureaucracy was necessary, this must have been included in the 
state's budget. Even if the appointment was that of a 
presidential adviser, as they have tried to justify, it must 
have been made through the signing of the president and the 
corresponding minister. 
  The appointment of the minister without portfolio or an 
adviser was legally and fiscally validated through one single 
signature, that of the president of the Republic. What is even 
worse, the presidential measure has entailed other important 
consequences such as the decisions of the Cabinet Council, which 
should be signed by the new member. This holds particularly 
true given there is no law creating this post, and the minister 
without portfolio does not have functions. It would be legally 
an appointment without a specific objective, which could border 
on a criminal offense against the public administration. 
  We believe the appointment of a minister without portfolio 
is 
another of the so many bloopers President Endara has made during 
his administration. The minister without portfolio will be a 
minister without specific functions, receiving a high salary and 
without a justification. 
  Should the figure of the minister without portfolio be 
maintained, the Cabinet Councils would include the body of 
advisers, making its functioning inoperative. This would also 
adversely affect the economic policy of reducing the government 
payroll, for which so many lower-ranking public employees were 
sacrificed. 
  Regardless of the Supreme Court of Justice's ruling on this 
issue, the appointment made by President Endara to please a 
political demand represents an unpardonable sneer at the 
Panamanian people, particularly the thousands of Panamanian 
people who are unemployed and the very public servants who have 
struggled for a wage hike. 
  While government leaders have said they do not have enough 
money to meet the demands of thousands of fellow Panamanians who 
yearn for a job in the government or higher wages, the 
government proceeds to appoint a minister without portfolio 
without any legal or fiscal basis. In an attempt to analyze the 
legality of this issue, it must be asked "What annual report 
would the new minister present? What report would be explained 
before the Assembly? What would be the obligations and rights 
of this new public servant, and has he previously filed a 
declaration of his properties?" 
  That is why the announcement on the reaction of the 
Legislative Assembly, which has filed an unconstitutionality 
writ against the appointment, is so important. This decision is 
not the result of an individual's feelings, rather, the 
institutional reaction of that important state branch. This 
represents a forewarning against the actions of the president of 
the Republic. The state is not a private farm in which 
decisions are made arbitrarily. The legal order must prevail 
not only in the defense of the state but also out of respect for 
those holding government offices. Consequently, given the above 
presumably legal justifications, the principle of legality, 
which does not permit the creation of an arbitrary figure, must 
prevail.

<F P=106> [Article by Stella van Rijn: "Parties Agree on Antillean </F>
Cabinet; Coalition Holds 16 Out of 22 Seats"] 
  [Text] WILLEMSTAD -- The new Antillean cabinet is virtually 
ready. The political agreement between the parties which will 
form the new government in the Netherlands Antilles, will be 
signed in Willemstad next Tuesday. 
  Negotiator Pourier is conducting the final discussions about 
the division of powers and about the candidates for the cabinet 
positions, but he does not expect any problems which might 
jeopardize the political agreement. 
  The new government will be made up of the Antillean 
Restructuring Party (PAR) [Partido Antia Restruktura] and the 
New Antilles Movement (MAN) from Curacao, the Democratic Party 
(DP-B) from Bonaire, the Sint Maarten Patriotic Alliance (SPA), 
the Democratic Party (DP-StE) from Saint Eustatius, and the 
Windward Islands People's Movement (WIPM) from Saba. 
  The coalition relies on a comfortable majority of 16 out of 
the 22 seats in Parliament, called the "States." Former Prime 
Minister Maria Liberia-Peters' National People's Party (PNP) is 
going into opposition in Parliament. 
  The government program deals with the reorganization and its 
consequences for the central administration's restructuring. 
Pourier aims at organizing a referendum on the islands' 
political future next September on all islands at the same time, 
as was already the case on Curacao last November. 
  In addition, the Pourier cabinet will also pay much 
attention 
to improving education, reducing public health expenditure, 
reorganizing the civil service, as well as drug and crime 
prevention. 
  Relations with the Netherlands will also be reviewed by the 
new cabinet. The Netherlands' involvement will have to change, 
Pourier says. The Netherlands will have to play a more 
complementary role. 
  The Antillean Government has a responsibility of its own. 
Only in fields where it cannot assume this responsibility on 
its own authority, will Pourier call upon the Netherlands for 
assistance. He wants, for instance, that Sint Maarten be placed 
under the high supervision of the Antillean Government, rather 
than of the Netherlands Government in the Hague. 
  As soon as possible after the cabinet's inauguration, 
presumably on 31 March, the new prime minister wants to consult 
with the Netherlands in order to reach an agreement on the 
financial relationship, on relations between both governments 
and between the various islands and the Netherlands, on youth 
problems and on development aid.

  [Excerpts] National Congress of Democratic Movements 
[Conacom] leader Victor Benoit says the small problem of 
dissension existing within the National Front for Change and 
Democracy [FNCD] is between the president's allies and those who 
support him unconditionally. Benoit has presented himself as an 
ally of President Aristide, but has condemned the behavior of 
certain leaders whose main objective is to (?obtain) the post of 
prime minister. 
  Benoit says that what is going on within the FNCD is normal 
because the FNCD is a front that brings together many 
organizations with different political views: 
  [Begin recording] This is normal. It is good that 
discussions 
are going on within a political group. This shows that there is 
no one organization -- I could say -- to have attached its 
tentacles...[rephrases] that is setting the tone and making 
everybody go along with it. It is normal for people to hold 
differing views in a situation of crisis involving several 
levels of understanding. [passage omitted] [end recording] 
  We remind listeners that Conacom supports the new plan set 
up 
by parliamentarians in Washington, pointing out that this plan 
is inspired by the Governors Island agreement, the New York 
pact, and the Miami conference. In the opinion of Victor Benoit, 
it is therefore a good plan.

  [Text] Evans Paul, a member of the National Front for 
Change and Democracy [FNCD] and one of its spokesmen, thinks the 
parliamentarians' plan is realistic but that even if the plan is 
approved by the Haitian Senate, to implement it will be 
extremely difficult because President Aristide is hostile to it. 
  [Begin Paul recording] I still support the FNCD proposal. I 
think it is a realistic one. It is realistic because when we 
asked for the amnesty law to be passed, we felt there would be 
many advantages to passing it: First, it would set the stage for 
General Cedras' early retirment, in compliance with the promise 
he made in the Governors Island agreement. 
  Second, it would meet conditions that would enable President 
Aristide to appoint a prime minister once Gen. Cedras had gone 
into early retirement as promised. 
  My concern regarding the plan is what would happen 
afterwards, even if the Senate managed to pass this same plan 
via a resolution -- because I had a conversation recently with 
President Aristide, who told me that he is maintaining his 
position, and that he will not budge an inch as long as those 
who staged the coup d'etat...[rephrases] Gen. Cedras does not 
step down as head of the Army in compliance with the promise he 
made on Governors Island. [end recording] 
  That was a statement by Evans Paul, mayor of Port-au-Prince 
and FNCD spokesman.

  [Excerpts] Within the scope of world efforts to resolve the 
Haitian crisis, union representatives are meeting with President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. A delegation from the unions left Haiti 
last week. The members of the crisis committee of the Haitian 
union organization met with Aristide on 19 March to seek a 
solution to the critical situation in Haiti. A member of this 
delegation labeled their first meeting with Aristide as very 
promising. Representatives of six Haitian union organizations -- 
including the General Independent Organization, Federation of 
Unionized Workers, Federation of Haitian Blue Collar Workers, 
and the two branches of the Autonomous Organization of Haitian 
Workers [CATH], including Mezyeux's CATH and Manuci Pierre's 
CATH -- were present. 
  Jean-Claude Lebrun, secretary general of CTH, the Federation 
of Haitian Workers, said that during this meeting discussions 
turned on how to create the conditions necessary to the lifting 
of the embargo. [passage omitted] 
  A second meeting between the union committee and President 
Aristide is scheduled for 21 March. The delegation that is to 
meet with President Aristide is now in Miami.

  [Text] Exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide wondered 
whether Americans hadn't participated in the coup d'etat that 
overthrew him. He also doubted the United States' will and 
desire to restore democracy in Haiti. 
  Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was participating last week in 
the meeting of the Black Caucus, thinks the United States is 
supporting the authors of the coup d'etat. How can one claim the 
U.S. Embassy was not involved in the coup d'etat? asked the 
president-in-exile. 
  Aristide feels President Clinton still has a chance to 
prove, 
by restoring democracy to Haiti, that the United States was not, 
or is no longer, involved in the coup. 
  It should be recalled that Father Aristide made those 
statements in Miami where he was the guest of the Black Caucus 
at its meeting. At that forum, the president-in-exile severely 
criticized U.S. policy on Haitian refugees, calling it racist. 
Rothschild Francois has filed the following report: 
  [Begin recording] [Francois] Six months away from the third 
anniversary of his forced departure into exile, Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide seems to be beginning to lose patience and mostly to 
doubt Washington's will to favor his return to Port-au-Prince. 
Speaking over the weekend at the meeting of the Black Caucus in 
Miami, the Haitian president did not hesitate to criticize the 
Clinton administration's policies on Haiti. 
  Jean-Bertrand Aristide thinks the Americans are supporting 
the military who overthrew him in September 1991. Aristide 
said, further, that the Haitian people set great store by the 
democratic principle and would like for peace to spread 
throughout their country. 
  Without making direct reference to the international 
community, Aristide invites the Haitian people to mistrust those 
who, according to him, support criminals while claiming to want 
to defend democracy. 
  [Aristide, in Creole] People who claim that they are 
defending democracy and who, until now, have not done what they 
said they would do, are showing that they do not respect their 
word. 
  We ourselves have kept our word. We will continue doing 
everything possible for democracy to return home and certainly, 
it must end. 
  [Francois] During the meeting of the Black Caucus in Miami, 
President Aristide hailed the support received to date from the 
Black Caucus. The president also encouraged the initiative by 
the members of the Black Caucus, who intend to intervene with 
the Clinton administration so that it adopts a more aggressive 
policy against the Haitian military. In his intervention before 
the Black Caucus, the president also brought the discussion to 
bear on the matter of the boat people. 
  Aristide sharply denounced U.S. policy toward the Haitian 
refugees. It is a racist policy, says the president, who reminds 
everybody that Cubans are welcomed in the United States while 
Haitians are turned back. Aristide tries to compare this 
situation to a house on fire: Some of the people inside the 
house are trying to escape, while the police are forcing them to 
return to the house, which is burning. That is the way the 
president described it. 
  The exiled president stated that a solution to the problem 
of 
the boat people necessarily entails his return to the National 
Palace. Furthermore, Jean-Bertrand Aristide asked for a total 
embargo in order to force the military to accept his returning 
to Port-au-Prince -- a request rejected by Washington. 
  The Clinton government clearly pointed out that just 
reinforcing the sanctions cannot contribute to solving the 
crisis. 
  Washington requests the president to appoint a prime 
minister 
and to support implementation of the parliamentarians' plan. To 
date, President Aristide has refused to go along. 
  After a year of collaboration deemed good, the health of the 
relations between President Aristide and the Clinton 
administration is today hit by an epidemic of disagreements. 
  Meanwhile, in situ, nothing has really changed since the 
legislators passed their resolution for a solution to the 
crisis: The Senate is still in crisis; the military are 
refraining from taking a stand regarding the legislators' plan; 
the national economy is plummeting. 
  Meanwhile, one thing is certain: The word hope has begun to 
disappear from Haitians' vocabulary. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Lucia Domville and Jose Luis Gaona] </F>
  [Text] Private sector and academic sources have predicted 
that one of the last radical measures of the Salinas 
administration to perfect the trade opening and balance the 
deficit will be to draw up technical rulings on imports by the 
nine State Secretariats. 
  The process of enforcing standardization measures has been 
expedited since the implementation of NAFTA in an effort to 
regulate trade practices. The goal is to standardize the 
regulations of the signatory nations in just a few years, 
perhaps five. 
  The Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat 
(Secofin) 
has published in the official gazette an agreement that 
identifies 413 tariff groups for the classification of 
merchandise subject to compliance with official Mexican rulings. 
  Nevertheless, terms for the regulation of imports are 
pending 
from the Secretariats of Agriculture, Communications, SEMIP 
[Energy, Mines, and Parastate Industry], Health, Sedesol 
[Secretariat for Social Development], Fishing, Labor, and 
Tourism. 
  Sources from the business sector, the National Agricultural 
Council, the UNAM [National Autonomous University of Mexico] 
Legal Investigation Institute [IIJ], Canacitra [National 
Association of the Processing Industry], and experts on the 
issue have said that Mexico needs to create a regulatory system 
like those used in the United States and Canada if it wants to 
compete under equal conditions. 
  The IIJ authorities explained that the Mexican negotiators 
did not understand until very late that pure free trade does not 
exist and that governments unilaterally close or open the way 
for imports to their country. 
  That is why the over 400 Secofin terms published in the 
official gazette and the announcement of several regulatory 
packages are viewed as measures to restrict the flow of imports 
to Mexico and thereby control the trade deficit. 
  When this six-year period was initiated, many Secofin 
officials were inexperienced in world trade and lacked knowledge 
about how developed nations use free trade in their favor. That 
is why they were determined to apply the free market doctrine 
blindly, thus adversely affecting many companies. 
  Now, during the last leg of the Salinas administration, 
Secofin negotiators have learned how to use international laws 
in Mexico's favor. For many sectors, however, these measures 
are coming a bit late, representatives of the Mexican private 
sector have said. 
  The first sign Secofin gave of reversing the trade opening 
initiated in 1986 was the application of compensatory taxes 
against Chinese products. 
  Nevertheless, in these past years, the Union of 
International 
Trade Practices has actively sought out import products that 
harm national production and dumping [previous word in English] 
practices and have worked to identify sectors that require 
protection for survival. 
  Secretariat officials have said that the standardization 
process, "always operative," has been accelerated in the past 
two months in an attempt to hold back massive importation. 
  The use of measures related to standardization takes up 
Chapter IX under Article 904 of NAFTA. 
  In the first part, the "right to apply regulations for the 
security of human, animal, or plant life and for the 
environmental health of the consumer, the same as any measure 
that assures its fulfillment or its application," was agreed 
upon. 
  The second part establishes that "each party can apply the 
levels of protection it considers appropriate to achieve 
legitimate goals for security or protection matters." 
  Nevertheless, the fourth part states that the application or 
creation of technical regulations or nontariff barriers cannot 
be used as obstacles to trade. 
  Legal experts say the negotiating terms are ambiguous 
because 
a ruling could be interpreted for one party as falling under the 
protection or security provided for in the first part of Article 
904; while the other party could argue that such provisions are 
an obstacle to free trade and are therefore prohibited by the 
fourth part of the same article.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Daniel Oliva, attorney for the family of </F>
Jean Paul Genie, by unidentified reporter; from the "Five 
O'Clock Sharp" newscast] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Dr. Oliva what is the status of the 
Genie case after General Humberto Ortega appeared before the 
military [word indistinct]? Go ahead, Doctor. 
  [Oliva] Gen. Humberto Ortega arrived in the Judge Advocate's 
office today to testify [declaracion indagatoria], that is, he 
was considered to be a suspect [reo]. We expected Gen. Ortega 
to deny the charges or try to refute them with some kind of 
evidence. We never expected him to use this kind of sophistry. 
He claimed that he could not remember events or dates and that 
he knew nothing about other events because he had only learned 
that a young man named Jean Paul Genie had died during an attack 
by armed men at 2047 on 28 October. Gen. Ortega claimed that at 
0800 on 29 October he had already organized a commission 
comprised of high-ranking Army officers to conduct an 
investigation. 
  This commission was only created because someone had already 
said that the general's motorcade was the only one involved in 
the case. This commission did not allow any authority -- 
civilian or military, that is, the police -- to enter Complex 
003 to conduct investigations. This commission acted as a 
retaining wall to prevent any data at Complex 003 from appearing 
on a police report. [words indistinct] when he was asked whether 
Colonel [name indistinct] informed him in the commission's 
report that the log book, which contain information on the 
arrivals and departures of Renegade jeeps at Complex 003 and 
that there was a time entry that left no doubt that the 
motorcade could not have been at the site of the events. 
  That log book, however, was incinerated, and Gen. Ortega 
does 
not know that this book was incinerated even today. We did not 
expect this. This is unheard-of. Who could believe that they 
destroyed a book that contains the evidence, and that the 
parties that would have benefited from that evidence authorized 
its destruction. 
  Obviously, all these negative aspects contribute to 
reinforcing the presumption that all the accused, that is, the 
members of the motorcade and Humberto Ortega, are guilty. After 
testifying, Gen. Ortega was obviously considered a suspect, and 
a provisional arrest warrant was issued for him. This warrant, 
however, was replaced with house arrest. In other words, Gen. 
Ortega is under arrest in his house for 10 days or until the 
sentence is handed down. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Oliva, in view of this house arrest for Gen. 
Ortega, can he continue as Army chief? 
  [Oliva] No, no, impossible. 
  He has already said he would place himself at the disposal 
of the Attorney General's Office, which ordered his arrest. The 
Attorney General's Office has ordered Gen. Ortega to remain at 
his residence, with the limitations facing every arrested 
criminal. 
  [Reporter] What is next in this process [proceso] against 
Ortega? 
  [Oliva] Many witnesses have yet to testify. Many of them 
have not appeared in court or have not been located. 
Undoubtedly, we were unable to locate certain witnesses, 
because they are afraid, went into hiding. Others fear giving a 
deposition in which they will adversely affect such powerful a 
man. 
  [Reporter] What is your opinion on the person who is 
handling 
this process at the military inspector's office? 
  [Oliva] Hello? Hello? 
  [Reporter] What is your opinion or view on the person who is 
working at the military inspector's office on this process which 
began today and lasted more than five hours? 
  [Oliva] So far the prosecutors have simply handled the 
proceedings of the corresponding questions and answers. It 
cannot be said these officials have violated the law. The basic 
thing is to wait for the Attorney General's Office to write its 
final report and issue its judgment, to see whether the accused 
are sent to prison or the case against them is dismissed. 
  [Reporter] Can this provisional arrest of Ortega be 
indefinite? What is the situation? 
  [Oliva] No. This arrest cannot last for more than 10 days. 
If after 10 days the investigation has not been completed, 
Ortega will be ordered released on bail. If the report has been 
completed, a definite ruling will be issued. 
  [Reporter] What is the situation of the Inter-American Human 
Rights Commission in the Genie case? 
  [Oliva] They are waiting to learn if legal provisions or 
human rights are being violated in this process; in case this is 
true, they will naturally sanction not only the Nicaraguan 
Government but will issue an opinion stating clearly the 
responsibility of the accused.

<F P=106> [Report by Moises Castillo] </F>
  [Text] Matagalpa -- The Leftist Punitive Forces, FPI, 
issued a communique in Matagalpa announcing that it will take up 
arms again because of the insecurity "we are experiencing" and 
because the Chamorro administration has sentenced top FPI leader 
Frank Ibarra Rojas. The FPI says that although Ibarra was given 
amnesty, he is now being sentenced to 20 years. "We are giving 
the government a 72-hour deadline to release our leader 
unconditionally. Otherwise, we will hold the executive 
responsible for whatever happens in the country after the 
deadline expires," they said. 
  The FPI has also reported Commander Halcon missing and said 
they expect an answer from the government as to the whereabouts 
of that leader. 
  Former Lieutenant Colonel Ibarra benefited from an amnesty 
decreed by the government at the time of his surrender. The 
courts, however, have revoked that ruling and sentenced Ibarra 
to 20 years for the death of Dr. Arges Sequeira Mangas, 
president of the National Association of Owners of Confiscated 
Property. 
  The FPI staff also warned that it is in contact with all 
recompa forces to fight "this corrupt government, which starves 
the people and keeps them unemployed and in anguish." The FPI 
also demands that Jose Angel Talavera, alias El Chacal, be tried 
and sentenced for assassinating 211 of their Sandinist comrades. 
"He is not covered by the amnesty," they said. The FPI leaders 
called on Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta "to stop 
rewarding the murderers of the people." 
  The document, distributed to the media, adds: "We laid down 
our weapons to contribute to peace, but the government is not 
honoring its word. It always violates the agreements it signs. 
The government is putting us behind bars and making us 
disappear. We will fight to help our people."

<F P=106> [Interview with FSLN Deputy Willima Ramirez by Erick Aguirre </F>
originally published in EL SEMANARIO; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The internal debate in the FSLN [Sandinist National 
Liberation Front] seems to be heading toward a much more 
extensive, open, and transparent course, in which Nicaraguan 
society has observed, caught between surprise and amazement, how 
the sectarian diatribe and political discussion are striving to 
make what seems to be the preliminary move toward an 
Extraordinary Congress that will define programmatic, 
organizational, and statutory issues of vital importance to this 
enormous and well-organized political party. 
  All this discussion has an undeniable political content at 
its core, although many of those promoting it are trying to 
create overtones of a personal nature, with excessively 
ideologized undercurrents. 
  The FSLN should not be ideologically labeled immediately 
after a verbal battle in which one of every two or three groups 
tries to lord it over the others by means of demagogic 
blustering or by resorting to slanted attacks, rhetorical 
euphemisms, or personal criticisms without any political 
foundation. Instead, the political and organizational structure 
of the front should be transformed substantially from top to 
bottom, and adapted efficiently and coherently to fit new 
circumstances. 
  William Ramirez, an FSLN guerrilla comandante, party deputy 
in the National Assembly, and member of one of the committees 
(bylaws) created to prepare for the Extraordinary Congress, 
reflects in this interview about the diverse angles from which 
the debate has been approached. 
  Decorated with the "Carlos Fonseca" order, the supreme honor 
his party awards to its best militants, Ramirez speaks here of 
the type of party which, in his view, the FSLN should now become. 
  [Aguirre] Does the FSLN still carry, or should it continue 
to 
carry, the baggage of a political-military guerrilla 
organization? 
  [Ramirez] I believe the FSLN should not renounce its 
history. 
The FSLN's formation obviously had both a political and military 
origin; we cannot turn our backs on that, because it is 
something that actually happened; it is a part of history. It 
should be preserved as a historic landmark, to teach new 
generations what we human beings are capable of doing when all 
our options have been closed off and all the outlets for making 
our voices heard and our rights respected have been denied us. 
Starting from the basis of that historic experience, the FSLN 
should now adapt and adjust to the new political circumstances 
which the world is now experiencing, which Nicaragua is 
experiencing. I think we need to maintain and reemphasize those 
moral values and develop them in today's new circumstances. 
  [Aguirre] What does being a revolutionary mean to you now, 
at 
this point in history? 
  [Ramirez] More than anything else, it means identifying with 
and serving the interests of the poor, but it does not 
necessarily mean excluding other people who may contribute to 
the nation's development. It seems to me that injustice must be 
a spur that moves us to do battle constantly. The consequences 
of the inhumanity that the world's present circumstances are 
provoking must be another cause of sadness, another spur to move 
us to take action and fight. To me, being a revolutionary today 
means accepting a form of behavior and a theory identified with 
the interests of the downtrodden. 
  [Aguirre] How revolutionary is the FSLN today? 
  [Ramirez] I believe the FSLN is a revolutionary party, and 
we 
need to continue to keep it revolutionary. I believe it is 
dangerous for us to start dividing it into categories or to 
express strictly ideological positions, for we know that the 
front has always been full of a variety of political views. If 
people here start to say that the FSLN needs to consist solely 
of "pure Marxists," leaving no room for "liberals," or if we 
take strictly ideological positions and begin to divide the FSLN 
between haves and have-nots, between atheists and believers, 
rich and poor, finally, if we create categories among 
Sandinists, we will also be creating the germ of a split in the 
FSLN, for the FSLN has always been a front and it has never been 
a "pure" political party. There has always been a diversity of 
elements in the front, believers, nonbelievers, landowners, and 
workers, and there has always been respect for these different 
beliefs. That must be preserved in the FSLN. 
  [Aguirre] Does that mean that calling itself revolutionary 
now is more a matter of practical actions than of ideological 
concepts that seem very confused and seem to lack strong 
support...? Is that it? 
  [Ramirez] For many of us, what happened in socialism and 
with 
socialist ideas came as a sort of new discovery, and we realized 
that many values were not what we had been taught. Today things 
are seen in another way. I believe in humanity and I believe in 
socialism, and it seems to me that we have to try to help 
everyone to live better, to offer the technical and material 
conditions for the advancement of all the Nicaraguan people. I 
want a society in which all citizens have jobs, land, access to 
health care and education, where the capacity exists to produce 
material goods and where spiritual resources are expanded. But 
in reality, there is a specific crisis that we need to resolve, 
and until it is resolved it would be utopian to make promises 
while overlooking that reality. It would not just be utopian, 
but demagogic. We cannot offer the people something we know we 
cannot do. That would be irresponsible. 
  [Aguirre] In recent days, as we have learned from the 
diatribes and controversies recounted in the media, a more 
definite division of the waters of the currents of political 
thought in the FSLN has begun.... What is your position on all 
this? 
  [Ramirez] I do not think this is an ideological discussion; 
it is a personal attack aimed at one of the leaders, Sergio 
Ramirez. In order to discredit him as a presidential candidate 
they have begun to seek out his weak points, and so they have 
created an entire pseudo-ideological language that is nothing 
more than a coverup for an ideological discussion. People have 
started to say he is a social democrat, etc., with the intention 
of a priori discrediting him as a candidate. The 
truth is that in the FSLN we all share a program, Sandinist 
rules of behavior. I can ask any militant to support the front's 
program with me, and if he backs it I will expect that he act in 
accordance with that program. I will not be too concerned about 
whether or not he may own property, whether he is a believer or 
not. What interests me is that he does what the program says, so 
we can work together in the struggle. If we start to talk about 
categories, we need to remember that that is going to create 
divisions within the FSLN. 
  [Aguirre] Does it seem to you that the FSLN's present 
National Directorate is capable of guiding this process toward a 
full, popular, and pluralist democracy? 
  [Ramirez] Everybody agrees that the FSLN needs renewal, and 
in that renewal, its leaders must be included. I support that 
position. It seems to me that the present National Directorate 
played a great role in its leadership during the war, while we 
were underground, and while we were in office. Now we need to 
make room for new leaders. On whether or not they are capable of 
leading the front in these new circumstances, many of us know 
how they are currently working, and I feel there is no way at 
this time that the present national leadership can continue 
operating as it is doing, which is in a totally irregular 
manner. I think it is healthy not only to change the FSLN 
program based on the new circumstances and for the approaching 
election campaign, but also the bylaws, the internal 
regulations, and party officers. 
  [Aguirre] In your view, should a party like the present FSLN 
consider the possibility of once again turning to an armed 
uprising at some specific moment? 
  [Ramirez] That depends. In the Somoza era, our voices were 
heard on the radio only when we attacked, we were in the 
newspapers only when we were taken prisoner or we were dead, 
because we had no space. Today's conditions are different. Now 
we have room for political action, we have newspapers, radio 
stations; we cannot say the political conditions are the same as 
they were in the past. I believe we need to continue using 
political methods, civic and electoral routes to work out our 
internal disputes and bring about government changes in this 
country. In reality, the possibility of an armed uprising is not 
desirable for me, nor do I believe it would be for the rest of 
the Nicaraguan people. I definitely support a civic and 
electoral approach. I believe that is the best heritage we can 
give our children. 
  [Aguirre] I remember seeing Sandinists leading the fight 
against the Somozist guard, holding important posts in the 
Sandinist government, dealing with difficult situations (a 
government minister, along with the entire population, facing a 
hurricane like Joan, for example), always as Sandinist cadres; 
it would be said such people were proven Sandinists.... What 
sort of FSLN does a man like you expect at this time? 
  [Ramirez] I want a FSLN for all Nicaraguans. I would not 
like 
there to be an FSLN that excludes anyone, I would like an FSLN 
whose aspiration is to serve and fight for the interests of the 
poor. I want an FSLN that will reclaim the mystique that many of 
us have lost, a mystique that is practical and not a matter of 
speeches or party lines. I want this country to live better, I 
want the Nicaraguan people to live better. I want my party to be 
a united party, a party of men and women capable of keeping 
their nation free, with a moral quality that will serve as an 
example to all of Central America and the world. 
  [Aguirre] How does a Sandinist guerrilla comandante deal 
with 
a world like today's, with today's Nicaragua? 
  [Ramirez] It has been a difficult transition phase on a 
personal level. My first year in the National Assembly was very 
hard for me because I am not a man used to talking or giving 
speeches. I have always been more a man of action than a 
theoretician, but I realized that things have changed, that we 
had lost the elections, that my new place was in the National 
Assembly. It was not until the second year that I came to 
understand that that was where I should be fighting my political 
battles. I think that is still happening to many of our 
comrades. We have not yet realized that we are now something 
different. We want to continue being Sandinists and recover the 
best values of Sandinism. Now our struggle is not advanced by 
setting fire to this country, but by taking part in politics, by 
debating issues and expressing demands politically. Still, I do 
not reject popular struggle, union, or even political 
demonstrations. We need to combine all possible forms of civic 
struggle so this country will have the opportunity it has never 
had to move forward. 
  [Aguirre] This is obviously another context, another 
scenario. So, how do you view your time as a "guerrilla 
comandante"? Do you look at it with nostalgia, or does it seem 
only a romantic image? 
  [Ramirez] I view it as a recognition of something that 
happened. We were where we were, we did what we did. It was 
something that happened. I believe it was for the good of our 
country. I do not regret doing what I did or having been 
involved in the FSLN, but it seems to me that I should not--none 
of us should--live on past glories. We have to live in the 
present and play a new role in this society.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Carlos Tunnermann Bernheim] </F>
  [Text] The construction of democracy in Nicaragua is an 
imperative for our times. The challenge of creating it on firm 
foundations demands that we move forward to build a "culture of 
consensus," because a true democracy can only be created through 
the civilized instruments of dialogue and political negotiation. 
  Of course, in our tumultuous history there are unfortunately 
very few examples we can cite as valid precedents upholding the 
culture of consensus. Instead, the pages of our history are 
filled with the opposite phenomenon: the violent resolution of 
conflicts, the use of force, and a propensity toward one-man 
rule and dictatorships. Still, since it appears that democracy 
may finally have found a place in our history, it should be 
feasible to construct a democratic program that will enable us 
to prepare for the transition to the 21st century, based on a 
broad national consensus. 
  Nicaragua's critical situation and the new conditions of the 
world and of Latin America demand of our political leaders a 
process of maturation that will lead to a new political style, 
capable of setting aside, like museum pieces, the habits and 
ideas that no longer make any sense in our new national and 
international situation. 
  This is the challenge that the circumstances and patriotism 
impose on us, a challenge to which we must all respond if we do 
not want to remain prisoners of a political primitivism that is 
capable of placing us outside history and shutting the doors on 
any chance of progress. 
  We face multiple challenges: we need to consolidate the 
fragile peace we have achieved; move ahead toward true 
democratization; strengthen production systems in order to 
expand our exports; combat unemployment; give priority attention 
to social policies; and stimulate our incipient scientific and 
technical development. Our goal should be a more just and human 
society, not only a more prosperous market. The new 
international and regional competitiveness will leave us 
sidelined on the road to development if we do not clearly 
perceive our current challenges and step out boldly to face them. 
  In the Latin American debate on strengthening democracy, the 
need to promote social policies that are fully integrated in 
overall economic development strategies is taking on increasing 
importance. The new thinking, which overcomes the rigidity of 
neoliberal systems, grants a key role to social reform and the 
struggle against poverty as a way to strengthen democratic 
governability. The state cannot reduce its role to that of a 
simple "market watchdog." It must also shoulder its 
"compensating" responsibility on behalf of the most vulnerable, 
and those who bear the greatest brunt of structural adjustment 
plans. 
  The challenge of building democracy in Nicaragua also 
requires the internal renewal and democratization of the FSLN 
[Sandinist National Liberation Front], whose importance in our 
national political spectrum no one can deny. Until the FSLN is 
transformed into a modern, civilian, and participatory party 
that once and for all eradicates verticalism and the temptation 
of one-man rule, thereby creating an authentic democratic option 
for our people, the process of building democracy in Nicaragua 
will not have the firmness and amplitude we all want. 
  The FSLN's renewal needs to be the product of an extensive 
debate in which mutual respect for persons and ideas will 
prevail. Nothing is more contrary to that purpose than resorting 
to insults and calumnies, even using the Sandinist media and 
manipulating those who regrettably allow themselves to be used 
for such blameworthy procedures. 
  We hope the debate will proceed in another direction and 
take 
on the decency that respect for true Sandinist principles 
demands.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Victor Tirado] </F>
  [Text] On other occasions I have emphasized that for all 
nations, whether capitalist or underdeveloped, economic problems 
take priority; they are more important than purely political and 
military matters, since a nation's strength or weakness depends 
on the state of its economy. 
  I have also said that the political movements that are going 
to prevail and have a broad social base are those that are 
capable of finding solutions for serious economic and social 
difficulties. 
  A response must be made to the problems of inflation, 
stagnating production, unemployment, and many others. Of course 
there are political and social problems, but economics is also 
political, and it combines with everything; ultimately, 
economics is what matters. 
  This is how the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] 
should see Nicaragua's situation. But first the responsibilities 
must be clearly established, because, let us say this straight 
out, the truth is that we all have a stake in the fundamental 
cause of our economic crisis. 
  The FSLN's real debate should now focus on analyzing where 
this country is going. We need to examine, one by one, the 
social conflicts that have arisen from the election results, and 
so prepare to define the major lines of the economic battle for 
production and productivity. 
  The new FSLN cannot remain outside a revolution that 
emphasizes the market, competitiveness, efficiency, 
productivity, and scientific and technological innovation; in 
order to act in this situation, the front must prepare itself. 
  The FSLN needs to take part in this new reality, for 
otherwise it could lose its social influence. What must be 
defended now is economic reconstruction and the economic 
advancement of the nation. I believe there is no other way in 
sight at this time than convergence, economic collaboration, and 
working with the government on those points where we can agree. 
<H5>  Organizing Economic Thinking </H5>
  This is the new economic thinking the FSLN should organize 
to 
continue integrating into a single activity the informal 
sessions, and some that appear clandestine, so they will become 
legal meetings. 
  The present economic model cannot progress in the midst of a 
socioeconomic conflict that is the result of the aftermath of 
war. During the last three years the military conflict has not 
ended, and in the midst of all this, economic adjustment plans 
are being applied that have, and can have, no populist character 
because the present system that has been established here is one 
of market forces and free competition. According to the 
government, there is no other way to develop the nation. 
  However, some elements that do not warrant support in the 
stabilization plan are the orthodoxy of the adjustment, 
insensitivity toward unemployment, the concentration of wealth 
in sectors having little interest in investing and making 
sacrifices to boost production, business nepotism, and the use 
of this presidential term to engage in corruption. 
  For example, the government alleges that privatizing 
everything will solve the problem. No, it will worsen it. Any 
economic system that we want to construct requires a process 
during which an economic and educational level is developed 
(which we do not have today; it will take a number of years, 
many generations to achieve this). We must also look at the 
experience of other countries so that we will not act too 
hastily, and so that we can avoid making the same mistakes. 
  Our economic growth strategy must be based on two elements 
of 
maximum importance: our society is overindebted and the major 
part of this debt is our external debt. This means that we do 
not generate sufficient liquid resources to cover our 
consumption, much less to invest. In this situation, what 
strategy should we pursue? Should we consume based on our 
financial potential, or continue to go deeper into debt? 
  This is the reason why political language should not fall 
into the temptation of offering people what can never be 
produced in the mid- and long-term. We cannot offer a war, we 
cannot offer excellent hospitals, we cannot offer free services, 
we cannot offer special privileges and perks; instead, what we 
have to offer are hard work, sacrifice, and honesty. 
<H5>  Clash Between New and Old </H5>
  There are no universal remedies for overcoming economic 
ills. 
Every nation, depending on its own particular circumstances and 
its level of development, must find the appropriate way to get 
through its crisis. 
  The burden of the aftermath of the war falls on farmers and 
workers. The government has been forced to devote a large part 
of the budget to fighting people who have taken up arms again. 
However, the government has been using this as a pretext to 
design a fiscal and tax policy detrimental to production. 
  In its debates the FSLN should concentrate on these problems 
in order to restore the model of a mixed economy, one that can 
again begin to function normally. At this time, the important 
thing is to solve the economic crisis; this is an urgent task 
that cannot be postponed. To accomplish it, a national consensus 
is needed; we need cooperation among the government, the 
workers, and the business community: agreement among all social 
sectors. 
  An enormous vacuum can be seen in the FSLN leadership. Now 
we 
need to decide whether the partisan structures that are being 
maintained in a traditional format are appropriate or not. 
Thousands of workers and campesinos are rallying around the 
properties that have been acquired and that have to be paid for. 
Thousands of unemployed are supporting whoever can offer the 
most at this time. Departmental committees are more concerned 
about the unemployed than about the workers and people who own 
some land. The masses are experimenting with new social and 
production systems, while the FSLN still clings to its 
traditional system of leadership. 
  The forthcoming Extraordinary Congress needs to resolve this 
situation and weigh the need to develop a new type of cadres, 
people who are prepared to promote change and pursue a new 
course, for this generation of Sandinists has been unable to 
respond to the organization itself and even less to create a new 
program for the nation's economic sector. We are trapped in 
worn-out economic and political thinking. The congress needs to 
address this issue. The FSLN crisis is everyone's responsibility. 
  The different currents within the FSLN and the debate must 
be 
a part of the partisan democracy that gives life to the FSLN. 
  Still, this should not be considered simply politics as 
usual, as that would lead to the paralysis of the front; nor 
should these groups be treated as suspect. We need to be open 
and transparent. This is a fight between a new Sandinism and an 
old Sandinism that is refusing to die.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Reinaldo Antonio Tefel] </F>
  [Text] It is encouraging that a group of Sandinists who 
seemed to be locked into traditional positions have joined in 
the great Latin American current of the new democratic left and 
humanistic socialism. The document of the Pekin Guerrero Group, 
with that significant shift, opens up room for a Sandinist 
consensus on programmatic issues. This is made even more 
encouraging by two facts: 
  1. The fact that some strong intellectuals have made 
positive 
contributions to this document; and 
  2. The fact that among the members of that group there are 
people who just recently had been attacking, excluding, and 
criticizing those of us who, for a long time--and in some cases 
like mine, for years--had been calling for a profound democratic 
transformation of Sandinism, by updating its historic roots 
along the lines of democratic neosocialism. This creates hope 
that exclusionary tactics and abusive language may now be buried 
forever. 
  However, the document has some gaps on which we need to 
reach 
consensus before the Extraordinary Congress. I am only going to 
list them in order to promote a Sandinist debate of these issues: 
  1. We need to design a viable socioeconomic alternative to 
offer to oppose neoliberalism and statism, an alternative which 
will define the ground rules in our relations with the 
government and with other political parties, and will serve as 
our standard for the 1996 elections. 
  2. We need to adopt a self-critical position on the policies 
and actions of the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front], a 
self-criticism we owe to all Sandinists and to the Nicaraguan 
people. 
  3. We need to insist that the Extraordinary Congress 
establish effective controls for the transparent management of 
party assets. 
  4. Equality among all Sandinists needs to be established 
with 
complete clarity, rejecting any form of political elitism by 
dividing people into first- and second-class members. 
  5. From general statements on party organization on which we 
all agree, we need to move to organize clearly collective 
democratic leadership groups that correspond to the initial 
Sandinist form of collegial leadership, and do away with 
unipersonal authoritarian forms. Only in this way, with a 
collective democratic leadership, can we make the approach of 
the democratic left and humanistic socialism become a reality, 
and only in this way will we be able to bring about a profound 
transformation and renewal in unity.

  [Text] Ciudad Valles, San Luis Potosi, 17 Mar -- Carlos 
Artolozaga Noriega, president of the National Chamber of the 
Sugar and Alcohol Industry, said the sector has again become 
self-sufficient in terms of production, adding that within the 
next two years under the framework of NAFTA Mexico will become a 
net sugar exporter to the U.S. market. 
  Miguel Ortiz Jonguitud, president of the National Union of 
Sugar Cane Farmers under the CNPR [expansion unknown], demanded 
the implementation of agricultural programs to "prevent the 
destruction of sugar cane fields and to avoid frustrating the 
achievements reached so far in this six-year period." 
  At the 15th National Congress of the aforementioned sugar 
cane union, Artolozaga Noriega also said the current capacity of 
the sector is around 5 million tons, even though the sugar cane 
industry has been a net exporter of surpluses. 
  We initiated a recapitalization process, and, after noticing 
our prices were out of date, we realized we had neglected the 
area of tariffs, Artolozaga Noriega said. He said efforts are 
currently under way to control the marketing of sugar by means 
of the Sugar Commodities Market or the Trusteeship to Organize 
the Sugar Market (Forma) to continue efforts "to preserve the 
sugar cane industry." 
  Despite all of this, Artolozaga Noriega pointed to the fact 
that "several sugar mills have shut down," saying they have 
closed "in the wake of the economic collapses specific to the 
regions in which they were located." He also noted that four 
sugar mills are about "to go bankrupt," but this does not mean 
they have to be shut down, because he still hopes they can be 
reactivated in the mid- or short-term. 
  He added that the sugar mills that have already been closed 
are La Purisima in Jalisco, Juchitan in Oaxaca, and Libertad in 
Veracruz. Those that are about to go bankrupt are Independiente 
in Veracruz, Santa Rosalia in Chiapas, and Hermenegildo Galeana 
y Pujil in Tabasco. 
  Meanwhile, Ortiz Jonguitud said that despite the lack of 
infrastructure to work the nation's sugar cane fields, Mexico 
ranks fifth in the world in sugar production. 
  "As a result of a lack of new investments in various types 
of 
support programs and Mexico's transition toward a market 
economy, the situation in the sugar industry still has not been 
been rectified, and this is why we have to try to resolve this 
situation as soon as possible," Ortiz Jonguitud said.

<F P=106> [Report by Miguel Badillo] </F>
  [Text] Susumo Azano Moritani, president of the Azano Group 
headquartered in Jalisco, is willing to reach an agreement with 
AT&amp;T "as long as the agreement is reasonable and fitting," 
despite 51 years of abuses committed by the U.S. phone company 
that has sent Jalisco businessmen to jail. 
  Salvador Perez Gomez and Susana Manterola, Azano Moritani's 
attorneys, handed over a letter to EL FINANCIERO in which their 
client outlines his position on reaching an agreement with the 
U.S. company. This letter indicates that AT&amp;T owes the Azano 
Group $20 million for the building of a digital telephone 
production plant. 
  Meanwhile, attorneys commented that AT&amp;T had used its 
influence to pressure the Mexican Government through Jaime Serra 
Puche, commerce and industrial development secretary, and 
Claudio Gonzalez, presidential adviser on foreign investments -- 
both of whom "openly" supported the foreign company over and 
above the "fair and legal" interests of the Mexican business 
group. 
  In the document, the president of the Azano Group indicates: 
"We have always been willing to receive a reasonable payment 
offer, which AT&amp;T representatives have promised us again and 
again in countless meetings held to resolve the amount to be 
paid. Up until now, however, no agreement has been reached on 
any amount." 
  Azano Moritani's lawyers indicated that AT&amp;T is 
pressuring 
their client to accept each and every condition it has 
established. These conditions include a "confidentiality 
contract" AT&amp;T representatives want the Jalisco businessman 
to 
sign without indicating the amount they are willing to pay for 
the debt which has been pending for more than three years. 
  Salvador Perez Gomez and Susana Manterola explained that the 
legal proceedings against AT&amp;T are heading in an "excellent 
direction," and, therefore, the Azano Group is confident that 
very soon its suit against that U.S. telephone company will be 
resolved. AT&amp;T will have to pay $20 million it still owes, 
otherwise the AT&amp;T plant in Guadalajara will be placed under 
an 
indefinite seizure. In addition, AT&amp;T officials would have to 
serve prison terms for fraud. 
  The attorneys also noted there is a resolution pending -- 
No. 
214/93 -- in the Third District's First Civil Court, where 
Susumo Azano Moritani has presented evidence against AT&amp;T. 
This 
evidence includes the fact that AT&amp;T presented an amparo 
plea in 
an irregular manner. This legal document was delivered to Judge 
Vidal Cuevas Barba's residence at a time when he had no 
jurisdiction in the case. 
  Meanwhile, the first judge of the civil court refused to 
execute the arbitration award given the countless procedural 
violations of a public order nature [violaciones procesales de 
orden publico], thereby ruling in favor of Avanti Construction 
Co. owned by the Azano Group. 
  In this ruling, the first judge of the civil court resolved 
to declare as "null and void everything filed before the ninth 
judge of the civil court in which AT&amp;T presented the 
accusations. For this court, the recorded violations are 
sufficient to uphold the conclusions outlined in the previous 
paragraphs." 
  Given this, AT&amp;T waived its amparo and asked the judge 
to 
return its documents that were grounds for the claim; this 
implies a dismissal of charges. 
  Regarding AT&amp;T's statements that work at the plant had 
not 
been completed, claiming it had been abandoned by Avanti, the 
attorneys said the telephone plant began operations on 24 July 
1991. As evidence of this fact, they presented a thank you 
letter from AT&amp;T dated 22 August 1991. 
  Two days later, on 24 August of that same year, AT&amp;T 
President Robert Allen declared in Guadalajara that the first 
telephone equipment manufactured at the plant was of very high 
quality on an international level, thereby contradicting the 
aforementioned claim that work at the plant had not been 
completed.

<F P=106> [Report by Lucia Domville] </F>
  [Text] The Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial 
Development (Secofi) has not decided how it will resolve tariff 
inconsistencies affecting nearly 20 production networks as a 
result of the tariff reduction program negotiated under NAFTA. 
  Representatives of the private sector have asked the Foreign 
Trade Commission (Cocex) to apply Rule 8 of Chapter 98 of the 
General Importation Tax Tariff (TIGI), which creates entire 
tariff brackets which eliminate tariff irregularities 
[desfasamientos arancelarios] on similar products. 
  According to foreign trade experts, mainly small- and 
medium-sized businessmen -- specifically those who did not see 
tariffs reduced to zero on products they import within the 
framework of NAFTA -- have filed complaints with the authorities. 
  Up until mid-February, at least 20 cases of tax 
irregularities had been filed with Cocex, which comprises 
officials from Secofi, the Finance Secretariat, and the Bank of 
Mexico. 
  Among those products facing open-market competition while 
encountering disadvantages in the cost of their component 
imports are: Padlocks, tools, movable iron pipes, agriculture 
transport or milk storage tanks, fish meal, sausages, 
refrigerators, leather belts, and others. 
  For example, in the NAFTA tariff brackets for machinery and 
equipment, the reduction rates rates are greater than those for 
similar products under the TIGI, which is used by third-party 
countries. 
  The inconsistencies for the aforementioned products 
translate 
into a tariff reduction rate that is slower than the one for 
imports from which these final products are made. Therefore, 
the raw materials for iron products face a 10-percent tariff, 
while the final product -- say, a padlock -- has been exempted 
from tariffs altogether since the day the trade agreement went 
into effect. 
  According to sources, some of the cases that have been 
brought before Cocex are not always similar to the 
above-mentioned cases -- those involving compact disk or bag 
manufacturers, for example -- because these industries never 
participated in the negotiations. 
  Meanwhile, some small- and medium-sized businessmen charge 
their interests were not defended by the Coordinator for Foreign 
Trade Business Organizations (COECE) and were sacrificed to 
obtain concessions in favor of large Mexican businessmen. 
  To correct the situation, Cocex has suggested that Rule 8 of 
Chapter 98 of the TIGI be applied, eliminating all tariffs at 
the same time for each and every component of a production 
network. 
  Rule 8 is not a new option, because it has been discussed at 
the legislature for more than 10 years. Nevertheless, in 
general, no new brackets have been added using Rule 8 over the 
past five years. 
  Sources said Secofi officials have refused to resort to this 
provision, because it would only represent temporary solutions 
for some products. It is not a matter of creating a new tariff 
bracket under Chapter 98. 
  The bottom line is this: The cards have already been dealt, 
and NAFTA legislation prohibits "recanting" negotiated 
concessions; only negotiations to further reduce tariffs for 
products under the terms of Article 302.2 are expected to be 
held. 
  The seriousness of this situation, according to warnings 
from 
foreign trade experts, is that, if the final product pays less 
taxes that its component parts, there will be trade imbalances 
that favor imported goods. Additionally, they noted that if 
this matter is not settled promptly -- already, more than 30 
days have passed since the notification -- domestic producers of 
goods facing competitive disadvantages with regard to foreign 
goods will tend to disappear or become product marketers. 
Foreign trade experts warn that the effects of this must not be 
underestimated, especially in advance of new tariff negotiations 
with the United States and Canada.

  [Text] Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz admitted on 28 
February that about 60 peasants who were growing coca were 
detained in the 26 February clashes and subsequently released. 
The peasants are under investigation by the Special 
Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) over their alleged ties to drug 
trafficking. 
  Soliz said the measure was taken after the intelligence 
services determined that the peasant mobilization was headed "by 
agitators," allegedly trained by drug traffickers who intend to 
create problems for the executive branch authorities. 
  Soliz noted: "Yes, there obviously exists some type of link. 
Records (of the detainees) have been prepared and the 
intelligence services will surely determine who these people 
are. If they have any ties to drug trafficking, these people 
will be called to testify at FELCN." 
  He said the infiltration of drug traffickers in the 
assemblies and meetings of coca growers aims to prevent the 
growers from understanding the alternative development program's 
benefits for Chapare's peasant communities. 
  He expressed optimism, however, that the interrupted 
negotiations with coca growers will be resumed on 3 March. Soliz 
added: "We understand they will attend the meeting, and in this 
regard we want to use all our ability for dialogue to see if 
they are sincere in resuming the dialogue and fulfilling the 
law." 
  He said the task of eradicating illegal coca in Chapare will 
continue in accordance with the plans of national officials and 
in strict compliance with the law. He announced that the Social 
Defense National Secretariat installed a permanent office in 
that region with experts and under secretaries who will contact 
the real producers at least five days each month to promote 
alternative projects. 
  Soliz also reported that several coca growers' leaders are 
constantly threatening the peasants who want to join the coca 
replacement plan, and this clearly shows the political handling 
of the coca problem.

  [Editorial Report] Bolivian dailies La Paz PRESENCIA and 
Santa Cruz EL MUNDO of 29 January report that on 28 January 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and Vice President Victor 
Hugo Cardenas traveled to Camiri, in Santa Cruz Department, to 
commemorate the 102d anniversary of the defeat of the Guarani 
nation at the Battle of Kuruyuki. During the celebrations they 
met with 4,000 Guaranis and responded to their demands for 
education and territorial recognition. 
  The president, according to 29 January EL MUNDO, traveled 
to Camiri with other high officials to launch his nationwide 
Educational Reform Program and, by establishing the first 
Guarani Educational Council, he legally recognized the Guarani 
bilingual education program. Launched in 1992, this program 
involves 30 schools and offers bilingual instruction to children 
as well as adult literacy classes. It operates under the 
auspices of UNICEF and other nongovernmental organizations such 
as the Peasant Research and Promotion Center (CIPCA) and the 
Social Investment Fund (FIS). It is estimated that over 5,000 
people have taken advantage of the program so far. [La Paz 
PRESENCIA "Reportajes" Section 23 Jan] 
  La Paz daily PRESENCIA of 29 February reports that during 
the visit, Vice President Cardenas, Bolivia's first indigenous 
vice president and a prominent advocate for indigenous rights, 
declared that "the existence of slavery in the Bolivian Chaco is 
a disgrace to all Bolivians," referring to the estimated 10,000 
Guaranis living in indentured servitude on large estates in 
Chuquisaca and Tarija Departments. There are also "free" Guarani 
communities in Santa Cruz Department that maintain a tenuous 
hold on their communal lands, as spotlighted in a 16 January 
PRESENCIA special investigative report (LATIN AMERICA DAILY 
REPORT 18 Feb). 
  Santa Cruz daily EL MUND0 of 29 January reports that in one 
of the first steps to combat this situation, President Sanchez 
de Losada officially announced a resolution that would make 
bilingual education in what the press describes as "captive 
areas" compulsory. Large landholders of Tarija and Chuquisaca 
would be obligated to build schools on their estates for their 
workers. The schools would come under the supervision of the 
Secretariat of Education. The FIS, for its part, would give 
special attention to the improvement and creation of educational 
infrastructure for the Guaranis. Finally, the Guarani Higher 
Institute for Bilingual Intercultural Education would be 
established. According to the 22 January issue of PRESENCIA, 
Maria Calvo, under secretary for ethnic affairs, said that the 
extension and consolidation of bilingual education into 
"captive" areas is one of the most important steps taken to 
mobilize those Indian groups who remain in illegal servitude. 
She acknowledged that this task will not be easy because of 
opposition by landlords who have accused "literacy campaign 
workers" of preparing "an armed revolution" and of "fomenting a 
workers uprising," as reported by PRESENCIA "Reportajes" section 
of 23 January. 
  Other reactions to PRESENCIA'S report on slavery in the 
Chaco came from Human Rights Commission officials in the Chamber 
of Deputies who resolved to take concerted action with 
government and nongovernmental organizations to end these human 
rights abuses, according to 22 January PRESENCIA. A few days 
before the 28 January presidential visit to Camiri, Guarani 
People's Assembly (APG) spokesman, Guido Chumiray, was reported 
by the 24 January issue of PRESENCIA to have met with the 
Secretary for Ethnic Affairs Ramiro Molina to review a list of 
demands to be submitted to the president at that time. First on 
his list, the paper said, was the "legal recognition of Guarani 
territory" to halt the tide of confiscations, remedy unequal 
land distribution, eliminate illegal servitude, and stem 
migration to the cities. The list also called for the creation 
of a Guarani Development Fund for the implementation of 
agricultural projects in the Chaco among the "free" communities. 
Projects would include irrigation systems, agricultural research 
centers, credit for the purchase of machinery, the 
rehabilitation of arable land, the purchase of livestock, and 
marketing promotion. The secretary observed, according to the 
daily, that the situation of slavery for thousands of Guaranis 
in the Chaco is a decades-old problem and acknowledged their 
"subhuman" living and working conditions as well as the 
extermination and extinction of other Indian groups. He agreed 
that current land legislation needed to be modified, but that it 
should be done in coordination with other secretariats and 
representatives of Indian groups. Following President Sanchez de 
Lozada's visit to Camiri, PRESENCIA 29 January reported that 
"with the official establishment of the [Guarani] Council, the 
government partially acceded to APG demands on the subject of 
education but maintained a discreet silence with respect to the 
other demands submitted in La Paz."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Bolivia monitored through 17 
March. 
  The annual balance of the mining and metal working 
industries 
issued by the Mining Secretariat shows that mining exports 
dropped 12 percent in 1993 compared with the previous year. 
Sales abroad totaled $366 million. (La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 1 
Mar 94 p B4) 
  The revenues of the six state-run companies that will be 
privatized amounted to $1.060 billion in 1993. Bolivian 
Government Oil Deposits accounts for 59 percent of this total; 
Lloyd Boliviano Airlines 10 percent; and the remaining 30 
percent is distributed among the National Railway Enterprise, 
the National Telecommunications Enterprise, the National 
Electricity Enterprise, and the National Smelting Enterprise. 
(Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 1 Mar 94 p 3) 
  The Minera del Sur Inc. Company, Comsur, this year will 
invest $30 million, including a $12.3 million credit recently 
granted by the World Bank, to promote mining operations in many 
parts of the country. Comsur, whose main shareholder is 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, is planning to invest $26 
million in the Bolivar mine in Oruro. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in 
Spanish 1 Mar 94 p 1) 
  The Andean Development Corporation approved two loans for 
$98 
million for Bolivia. A $38 million loan was approved for the 
improvement of highways. Another $60 million loan was approved 
for financing investment projects and operating capital to 
foster productive activities in the farming, livestock, 
agro-industrial, industrial, mining, tourism, and services 
fields. (La Paz Radio Fides Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 17 Mar 
94) 
  Miguel Cirbian, Bolivian Government Oil Deposits exploration 
manager, reported that the new Los Kusis oil field discovered in 
Santa Cruz can initially produce 150 barrels per day. The field 
also can produce natural gas. (La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 2 Mar 
94 p B2)

<F P=106> [Report by Gaston Sulage from the Sheraton Hotel in Buenos </F>
Aires -- live] 
  [Text] The First World Conference on Telecommunications 
Development, organized by International Telecommunications 
Union, has just been opened. U.S. Vice President Albert Gore 
and President Carlos Menem gave addresses. 
  Al Gore thanked Argentina for hosting this conference with 
such a magnificent level of hospitality -- referring to Menem -- 
and asked everyone to help him create a global infrastructure of 
information. He added that information is a treasure which must 
be shared if it is to be of true value. 
  Let us now go to an excerpt of Menem's address: 
  [Begin Menem recording] As Argentines, Argentines who are 
doubly proud. First for the distinction of having been chosen 
to host this conference. Also for the opportunity of showing 
the world our achievements in the arduous task we have 
undertaken, to transform the state and especially the 
privatization and deregulation of the communications sector. 
  It has been an essential step in our policy: To modernize 
the 
country's structure and thus be better armed to confront the 
challenges of the 21st century. 
  We have done all this and will continue, thinking of future 
generations. This why the transformation process being 
implemented avoided every opportunity for speculation. [end 
recording] 
  That was part of Menem's address. He also stated that during 
the course of this conference, a contract will be signed to 
expand the cellular telephone service throughout the country, 
and that a international tender, one of the few examples in the 
world, is about to be issued to resolve the structural problem 
of how to control the radio-electric spectrum.

  [Text] To attract international attention to the necessity 
of using telecommunications resources more harmoniously in the 
five continents: This is one of the main messages U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore will convey in the speech he will deliver at 
the ceremony opening the First World Conference on 
Telecommunications Development, which is promoted by the United 
Nations and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). 
The event, which will take place in Buenos Aires and will be 
attended by Argentine President Carlos Menem, will gather 
together representatives from 182 countries. 
  On 18 March USIS distributed a note reporting on the special 
attention the United States is giving to the event, in that Vice 
President Gore is involved in the issue of the development of 
the "information superhighway." This network will enable the 
United States to create the conditions to transmit images, data, 
and voice through one physical medium. 
  Another important point to be viewed in Gore's speech will 
be 
the proposal to open the telecommunications area to bids, 
because in several countries telecommunications are a monopoly, 
under state control. Gore will go to Argentina to defend the 
fast deregularization of the sector, as this is "a path that can 
increase investment in the area and result in improving the 
quality of the services." 
  This message, and the idea of ensuring harmonious 
development, will also be presented at the G-7 conference 
scheduled for July in Italy. Al Gore will stay in Buenos Aires 
only for the opening of the conference, which will last nine 
days. The U.S. delegation to the conference is comprised of 
representatives from the Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC), which regulates this sector; from the Department of State 
and the Department of Commerce; and from private enterprises. 
FCC Chairman Reed Hunt will take the opportunity to point out 
to those attending the conference that "information" can be in 
two places at the same time. He will address them via 
satellite, live, from another meeting -- the National 
Association of Broadcasters convention -- which will be taking 
place in Las Vegas in the United States. 
  Gore will begin a series of discussions searching for 
harmonious solutions to telecommunications development. What 
has become clear is that it does not help to concentrate 
physical means, optic fibers, and satellites in the northern 
hemisphere while the world turns around a globalized economy. 
The program contemplates the definition of practical actions. 
  Another goal of the meeting is to discuss the bases for ITU 
regulations and programs aimed at developing telecommunications 
during the 1995-1999 period.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 21 Mar (NA) -- Raul Granillo Ocampo, 
the Argentine ambassador to the United States, has pointed out 
that the approval of a pharmaceutical patents rights law "does 
not represent a great conflict" between the United States and 
Argentina. 
  "It is different to negotiate from a hostile perspective 
than 
to do so from a perspective of two countries that want to work 
together," he added in brief statements from Casa Rosada after 
the meeting between President Carlos Menem and U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore. 
  Granillo Ocampo said that the Menem administration "is very 
interested in the approval" of this law on pharmaceutical patent 
rights, which is currently being discussed in Congress. 
  "We believe patent rights must be recognized. We are also 
discussing the way in which national interests must also be 
taken into consideration," the diplomat said. 
  Making a balance of his work, he pointed out the 
strengthening of the national image and a greater understanding 
between Argentina and the United States. 
  "Several problems that were harming our relations have been 
solved, we have obtained important visits, and all this is 
positive for the five months I've been in my post," Granillo 
Ocampo said.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 21 Mar (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
today left an apparent sensation of confusion over the 
pharmaceutical patents law insistently claimed by the United 
States. While he said that without the approval of this law it 
would be "impossible" for Argentina to join the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), he at the same time played down 
the idea that the delay in approving the law would dramatically 
influence things, considering that all the pressures so far 
received are but "warnings." 
  The contradictory concepts became apparent during a news 
conference given by Menem at Government House a few moments 
before receiving in his office U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who 
arrived in Argentina to speak precisely about the need for 
Argentina to have a law on pharmaceutical patents rights 
acknowledging the rights of foreign inventions, as well as about 
the dangers of corruption and drug trafficking. 
  During the news conference President Menem gave his opinion 
that approval of a law on pharmaceutical patents rights "does 
not represent an absolute condition" by the United States for 
Argentina to access NAFTA, while a little after he added that 
"in principle there is no possibility that Argentina could join 
NAFTA if the pharmaceutical patents rights law is not approved 
first." 
  Afterward Menem said that the claims and connections between 
the approval of the law and joining NAFTA "are simply a kind of 
warning about our relations," noting that "the Argentine 
Government is doing the same with the U.S. Government regarding 
agricultural subsidies." 
  Instead of clarifying the Argentine position regarding this 
controversial subject, Menem's statements really contributed to 
generating greater confusion among those who, soon after he made 
his statements, began to closely read and analyze them. 
  The president said that the draft law on pharmaceutical 
patents rights "is one of the promises we made to the U.S. 
Government two and a half years ago, when Carla Hills was U.S. 
trade representative," adding that "since then we have been 
making efforts to get Congress to approve the law." 
  On another subject, Menem again denied the possibility that 
the opening up of labor laws will be imposed by decree, and said 
that the government expects the bill "to be approved by 
consensus in Congress." 
  The Argentine president also noted statements by Eduardo 
Bauza, secretary general of the presidency, that the candidates 
for Menem's vice president are Vicente Joga, Ruben Marin, and 
Eduardo Duhalde. 
  Menem said: "In a party like the Justicialist Party, and in 
a full democracy, those who decide on the presidential ticket 
are not the leaders but the party members." 
  Further on, Menem spoke about former British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher, saying that "she was too outspoken when she 
said that Argentina's return to democracy is partly due to her." 
  He described her statements as "absurd and aggressive," 
considering them "things one has to listen to and then be silent 
about, as they make no sense." 
  "Here we live in democracy and freedom thanks to the 
Argentine people, and in no way thanks to Mrs. Thatcher," he 
stated. 
  Menem said that the Malvinas war "was not the unleashing 
factor that made Argentina return to democracy and freedom. It 
was the people's permanent and constant struggle that made 
tyrannies lose their validity, here as in any part of the world." 
  Asked whether Thatcher's presence in Chile would affect 
relations between Chile and Argentina, Menem said that relations 
"have never been as good as they are now," adding that relations 
"at the Armed Forces level are really spectacular." 
  On another subject, Menem said he does not share the belief 
of Radical Civic Union leader Leopoldo Moreau, who said that the 
Constituent Assembly should place all judges on availability 
status [en comision]. 
  "This is an entirely unwise statement which is not in 
keeping 
with the current terms referred to in the Constitution," he said. 
  As for the medical checkup he will undergo tomorrow at the 
Buenos Aires Cardiovascular Institute, Menem said it was 
"routine," adding that "I have had them ever since I came to the 
presidency." 
  "The thing is that they are now more significant, following 
the carotid surgery I underwent last October," Menem stated. 
  He also said on that on 1 May he will announce during his 
message to Congress the implementation of a three-year plan that 
will extend through 1996. 
  "All the conditions are ready to announce something of this 
kind through 1996 or perhaps 2000," he said, adding that "we 
have had a zero inflation rate since last year." 
  Menem then said that he was aware of the charges by nun 
Martha Pelloni regarding the alleged sale of babies in 
Corrientes Province. 
  He said that "a charge of this kind, in which several 
organizations are mentioned, is worrisome" adding that "the 
subject is being investigated."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 21 Mar (NA) -- An official source said 
today that any ambiguity in President Carlos Menem's concept of 
the pharmaceutical patents law and the conditions for joining 
NAFTA "is in appearance only." 
  The source admitted that in Menem's comments before meeting 
with U.S. Vice President Al Gore "some kind of misunderstanding 
could have occurred," while declaring that Menem had been 
referring not only to joining NAFTA as such, but also to its 
prior approval by the U.S. Congress, which will occur in the 
middle of this year. 
  The source also said that "the approval of the patents law 
this year will be solely a gesture of Argentine good will toward 
the U.S. congressmen," and that "within two years, however, the 
approval of that law will be an essential condition for joining 
NAFTA." 
  This explanation was necessary because Menem believes the 
approval of the patents law "does not represent a full 
condition" for joining NAFTA, while in private he said that 
without that law "it would be impossible" to imagine Argentina 
becoming a member of NAFTA.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 21 Mar (NA) -- U.S. Vice President 
Albert Gore this afternoon concluded a visit of slightly over 15 
hours to Argentina. During the visit he met President Carlos 
Menem to analyze, among other issues, the official draft bill on 
pharmaceuticals patents and the steps being taken to prepare for 
the Americas Summit to be held in Miami in December. 
  The number two man at the White House -- who has visited 
Argentina within the framework of a mini-tour of South American 
countries, including stopovers in La Paz and Brasilia -- 
completed this morning a heavy agenda with a meeting with 
Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella and a speech at the opening 
ceremony of the First World Conference on Telecommunications 
Development, which is being held in Buenos Aires. 
  At the end of the almost one-hour meeting between Menem and 
Gore, the Press Secretariat released a short communique pointing 
out that the visiting official "again praised Argentina's recent 
economic achievements and President Menem's personal commitment 
to the approval of the law on patents protection." 
  No other official reference was made to the pharmaceuticals 
patents bill, although diplomatic sources have admitted that the 
issue was one of the central topics discussed at the meeting. 
Emphasis was also given to antinarcotics legislation and the 
role performed by Argentina in the "peace missions" organized by 
the UN Security Council. 
  According to the communique released by the secretariat 
headed by Raul Burzaco, the U.S. vice president congratulated 
Menem for "his commitment to the democratic institutions, his 
efforts in favor of essential economic reforms, his commitment 
to supporting the international nonproliferation norms, and the 
constructive role played by Argentina as a member of the UN 
Security Council." 
  The communique reported that Gore praised President Menem's 
proposal to create a humanitarian aid contingent within the UN 
framework, which would be called the "white helmets." 
  The note also reported that one of the main issues discussed 
by the two presidents referred to details of steps being taken 
to prepare the so-called Americas Summit, which has been 
scheduled for December in Miami. 
  The note stated: "President Menem expressed satisfaction 
over President Clinton's invitation. The two leaders discussed 
some general issues related to this summit, including democracy, 
good administration, trade, and investment." 
  About Argentina's possible admission into the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the communique only reported that 
the two officials discussed ways to intensify trade ties between 
the two countries in the light of the recent ratification of the 
treaty signed by the United States, Mexico, and Canada. It did 
not mention that the United States allegedly conditions this 
admittance to approval of the patents law. 
  The issue, however, was discussed, and Menem himself pointed 
out the importance of recognizing the intellectual property of 
medicines when he admitted to journalists that this issue is a 
central element in U.S.-Argentine relations. 
  In short comments made at the Hall of Busts of the 
Government 
House, Gore said that the meeting with Menem "was profitable, 
because it had to do with topics of interest to both countries." 
  "We are equally concerned about improving our peoples' 
standard of living," Gore said. He also expressed his 
"admiration for President Menem's leadership." 
  The U.S. vice president arrived at Casa Rosada at 1035 amid 
intense security, which included the deployment of almost 100 
men inside and outside the government house. 
  Menem received the visitor at the entrance to the White 
Hall. 
He was accompanied by Minister Di Tella, State Intelligence 
Secretariat head Hugo Anzorregui, Antinarcotics Struggle 
Secretary Alberto Lestelle; and Argentine Ambassador to the 
United States Raul Granillo Ocampo. 
  Gore was accompanied by a reduced entourage comprised of 
Alexander Watson, assistant secretary of state for 
inter-American affairs; Richard Feinberg, national security 
senior director for inter-American affairs; and U.S. Ambassador 
to Buenos Aires James Cheek.

  [Text] Two cars parked near the U.S. ambassador's residence 
in this capital caused concern among the police forces in charge 
of the security of U.S. Vice President Al Gore. The police bomb 
squad verified that both cases were false alarms. 
  The bomb squad acted a little after 0830 today when the 
police considered suspicious the presence of a Renault 18 pickup 
on Libertador Avenue with a flat tire. After a thorough check 
the police verified it was only a false alarm. A police 
tow-truck removed the car from near the ambassador's residence. 
  Soon afterward, the bomb squad returned to investigate a 
white Renault 12 parked on Libertador Avenue, 80 meters from the 
ambassador's residence and which had also called the attention 
of the police. After inspecting the car, the police verified 
that this was also a false alarm.

  [Excerpt] Tucuman -- While the provincial Congress held an 
emergency session to condemn the attack against it by a group of 
workers of La Florida Sugar Mill, Judge Alfonso Zottoli ordered

[General Confederation of Labor] secretary generals; Jorge 
Gonzalez, secretary general of La Florida Mill labor union, and 
Enrique Romero, local Justicialist Party leader who hopes to

considered the masterminds of the incidents which took place on 
17 March. [passage omitted]

  [Text] La Plata, 17 Mar (NA) -- Today Buenos Aires Governor 
Eduardo Duhalde presided over the signature in La Plata of a 
decree establishing the expansion of the satellite informatics 
network for all of Buenos Aires Province. 
  Duhalde said: "With this new system, the farthest little 
school in the province will have access to databases and 
libraries not only in La Plata, but also in the rest of the 
country and abroad." 
  He added: "The system, however, is not limited to this sort 
of use but also will allow 127 counties to have fluid and direct 
intercommunication with the Provincial Civil Registration and 
Land Surveying. This is indispensable to save time on paperwork 
the people who live in the province's interior may have to make." 
  The governor explained: "Thanks to an agreement signed with 
the IMPSA [Pescarmona Metallurgic Industries Inc.] S.A. company 
we are not paying more to put this new system into operation 
than we were for the services we already had been receiving." 
  Duhalde urged the mayors attending the signing ceremony to 
hire computer experts so each county can make the best use 
possible of the "benefits and possibilities offered in the field 
from now on." 
  Concluding, the governor said: "This new system is really 
revolutionary and will allow all Buenos Aires Province 
residents, no matter what county they live in, to access 
information in any field they want to."

  [Excerpt] The Economy Ministry will transfer 50 million 
pesos to Catamarca to alleviate the effects of a very hard 
adjustment plan by which the province should eliminate, in two 
years, the public accounts in the red, which currently stand at 
$75 million annually. Deputy Governor Simon Hernandez has told 
PAGINA/12 that the commitments that were assumed under Decree 
349, signed by President Carlos Menem and Labor Minister Armando 
Caro Figueroa, "will entail no dismissals." However, a great 
many of the 23,000 provincial public servants are expected to be 
transferred through the sale of public enterprises. 
  The decree sets forth that the improvement of the province's 
fiscal and financial situation and the structural reform of the 
public sector will be implemented "in keeping with the economic 
policy guidelines that the national government has adopted on 
the subject." In this regard the Economy Ministry will in the 
next few hours transfer Treasury bonds for a nominal value of 70 
million pesos (the difference with the figure that the province 
will actually receive stems from the actual value of the bonds). 
  Acting Governor Hernandez -- Governor Arnaldo Castillo is on 
vacation -- said that the nation's contribution "was the 
condition we imposed for signing the fiscal pact. Another 
requirement that the Economy Ministry is fulfilling is the 
implementation of an investment program for 120 million pesos.

  [Text] The Argentine trade deficit was nearly $3.7 billion 
in 1993, considerably more than the 2.5 billion that had been 
estimated by the Economy Ministry in its three-year plan 
"Argentina in growth." 
  These figures, which were released yesterday by the INDEC 
[National Institute of Statistics and Census] census bureau, 
also show that 1993's deficit exceeded the previous year's 
deficit of $2.6 billion by some $1.05 billion. 
  Last year's deficit is evident from comparing total imports, 
which were $16.79 billion, against total exports, which totalled 
$13.09 billion. 
  Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo insists that these figures 
aren't alarming if you consider the increased amount of capital 
goods that are being imported. 
  According to Cavallo this trend means that companies are 
modernising and bringing their technology up to world standards. 
  During 1993 the purchase of capital goods increased by 33 
percent, going up from $3.1 billion to $4.12 billion. 
  Concerning exports manufactured goods increased by 29.8 
percent, fuel and energy by 13.1 percent while the export of raw 
materials dropped 6.5 percent. 
  As to imports consumer goods coming into the country 
increased by 10 percent, spare parts by 8.4 percent, cars by 7.1 
percent while 7.1 percent less fuel was imported. 
  Argentina's main suppliers were: the United States $3.86 
billion-worth of goods, Brazil $3.57 billion, Germany $1.02 
billion and Italy $980 million. 
  Argentina's main markets abroad were: Brazil which bought 
$3.57 billion worth of Argentine goods, the U.S. $1.273 billion 
and Holland $1.270 billion.

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 20 Mar (NA) -- Defense Minister 
Oscar Camilion said in Chile today that "the inclusion of 
Argentine troops in the UN peace-keeping forces in Bosnia and 
the fact that our troops must carry arms equivalent to those of 
other nations tacitly imply the lifting of the United Kingdom's 
arms embargo against us." 
  Camilion confirmed that a Argentine Army company of 150 men 
will leave "as soon as possible" for Bosnia-Herzegovina because 
"it is important for men of peace to militarily support the 
consolidation of peace in that region." 
  The defense minister is in Chile to participate in the 
Eighth 
International Aeronautics and Space Fair where the Cordoba 
Military Planes Factory is represented with various products. 
  Camilion will visit this year's fair, which is organized by 
the Chilean Air Force, where he will probably meet with his 
counterparts from other Latin American nations. 
  Camilion met yesterday with his Chilean counterpart Edmundo 
Perez Yoma, who was sworn in recently. The Argentine minister 
considers "the contact very satisfactory. It constitutes the 
political event of this trip." [passage omitted] 
  Asked about an eventual change of the arms balance between 
Argentina and Chile considering Margaret Thatcher's husband and 
son work in the arms business, Camilion said Chile's relations 
with the United Kingdom "do not include any arms sales that 
could affect commerce with our country." 
  Camilion said he did not have any news about the removal of 
mines on the Malvinas Islands, and again ruled out the idea of 
using Argentine personnel for the task. 
  Camilion traveled to Chile yesterday. He was accompanied by 
Juan Paulik, Air Force general staff chief, and other high 
ranking Air Force officers. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Brazilian Ambassador to Argentina Marcos </F>
Castriota de Azambuja by Conrado Etchebarne Bullrich at the 
National Union Club; date not given] 
  [Text] [Etchebarne] Is Brazil concerned about the 
possibility that NAFTA might spoil its relations with Argentina? 
  [Castriota de Azambuja] Argentina and Brazil have permanent 
cultural and geographical links. There are many difficulties. 
The more we trade and develop our relations the greater the 
possibility of problems. It is very difficult to have 
diplomatic problems with Nepal or other nations with which we 
have little contact. 
  Bilateral relations do not require a lot of imagination. It 
is determined by geography. There have not been any conflicts 
between our nations for over a century now. South America is 
almost the only region in the world where a 100-year-old map is 
still good because borders have not changed. 
  We were adversaries in colonial times and rivals throughout 
the 19th century. We tried cooperation in the 20th century and 
we are now partners. The objective when we were rivals was to 
put hurdles in the other nation's path. We would make access, 
paths, and communications difficult. Now we are partners. 
There is a spirit of partnership [preceding words in Latin]. 
The purpose now is to see that the other party is doing well. 
  It is also true that we began a difficult year and that our 
problems are real. Argentina can talk with the United States 
about joining NAFTA but cannot negotiate its entry by itself as 
long as it is a member of Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. 
The fact that Argentina is enjoying the prestige of being 
invited to join NAFTA does not hurt us. For the time being 
Brazil is not interested in NAFTA. We think that we must follow 
the path opened by President George Bush through the Rose Garden 
Agreement. This agreement is also known under the formula 4+1 
and was conceived within the framework of the Americas 
Initiative. 
  [Etchebarne] Would Brazil's proposal to create a free trade 
zone in South America also hurt Mercosur? 
  [Castriota de Azambuja] The train of integration goes 
through 
Mercosur. Brazil's absolute priority is Mercosur's customs 
unification. Negotiations with other South American countries 
refers to a free trade zone, and Argentina has being invited to 
join Brazil in the negotiations. 
  [Etchebarne] Will there be agreement on external duty 
levels? 
  [Castriota de Azambuja] Of course. In June we will agree on 
an external duty level. The humility earned through defeats 
caused by the failure of policies implemented through the 1980's 
makes agreement between the two countries easier. Brazil 
thought it could be self-sufficient. That was the dream, the 
national objective. To import was almost tantamount to treason. 
We contracted several bad bets during the 1980's which 
destroyed the Brazilian dream. It was thought oil prices would 
increase. For strategic reasons we purchased oil from Iraq 
instead of from our neighbors. We bet heavily on African trade 
but the matter did not work out. Then we bet heavily on 
protectionism. 
  [Etchebarne] What about relations with the United States? 
  [Castriota de Azambuja] The United States has its own master 
plan [preceding two words in English] based on NAFTA, but Brazil 
cannot accept negative preferences. Mexico's digestion will not 
be easy. The country has serious problems, as the kidnapping of 
the Banamex [National Bank of Mexico] president shows. It seems 
Chile will be the next country to join NAFTA because it is the 
only country that has done everything it had to. 
  The Americas summit in December will be important for 
defining our relations with the United States.

  [Excerpt] (NA-DYN) -- The Argentine government and Iberia 
reached an agreement yesterday [17 March] on the future of 
Aerolineas Argentinas (ARSA) whereby the Spanish airline's 
shareholding is increased to 85 percent. 
  At a joint press conference attended by ARSA and Iberia 
executives, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said that the 
Spanish airline has made a 500 million dollar capital injection 
of which 100 million will go to reserves and the remaining 400 
million towards settling accrued debts. 
  The Argentine government in turn will hang on to 15 percent 
of the share packet of which 10 percent has been assigned to the 
employee shareholding programme. 
  The government will also authorize ARSA and any other 
airline 
that operates in Argentina to run its own aircraft servicing 
facilities and will restrict the availability of non-regular 
flights. 
  There will be no restriction on the number of flights on 
domestic routes. 
  ARSA will continue as a national flag carrier, a condition 
which the government has undertaken to defend should any 
protests arise from countries with which it has bilateral 
aerocommercial agreements and who object that Iberia owns more 
than 49 percent of ARSA. 
  At the same time the government is able to maintain its 
rights to veto even though its shareholding could sink below the 
five percent stipulated in the privatization process. 
  ARSA however no longer has the power to veto route 
management 
decisions or the investment plan. 
  After three years and four months of intrigue and failed 
discussions, yesterday's deal ironically takes the whole 
privatization process back to its first stage. The new share 
distribution is exactly the same as the original distribution 
made when ARSA was first privatized. [passage omitted]

encountered a hitch as Intelsat, a United States-based satellite 
operator, has also applied for the same orbital slot. Energy, 
Telecommunications, and Posts Minister Datuk Sri Samy Vellu said 
Intelsat has applied to the International Telecommunications 
Union [ITU] to position its satellite at the 91.5 degree east 
orbital slot just as Malaysia had done for its Malaysia East 
Asia Satellite [Measat] 1. He said this when addressing the 
world telecommunications development conference in Buenos Aires, 
Argentina today. The nine-day conference is organized by the 
ITU. The text of his speech was faxed to the national news 
agency BERNAMA. Datuk Sri Samy Vellu said Malaysia had objected 
to Intelsat's bid to place its satellite in the same orbital 
slot to the Radio Communications Bureau as it would cause 
harmful interference to Measat.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Eduardo Lins da Silva from Washington] </F>
  [Text] Many people in the United States believe the 
Democratic Party 1992 presidential ticket was perfect, except 
for one detail: It should have been inverted, with Al Gore as 
the presidential candidate and Bill Clinton as the 
vice-presidential candidate. 
  All objective perception indicates that Gore is better 
prepared than Clinton to exercise the presidency of the United 
States. He has an excellent academic curriculum in the areas of 
law and philosophy, he served with the Army in Vietnam -- even 
though he always opposed the presence of the U.S. military in 
Southeast Asia -- he is an excellent speaker, he has never been 
accused of underhand business deals or of marital 
unfaithfulness, he is the son of a powerful and competent former 
senator, and he places himself in the center of the ideological 
spectrum. 
  Gore is the most influential and active vice president in 
the 
history of the United States, and he is the natural Democrat 
successor to Clinton. The president has left him in charge of 
some of the sectors in which he specialized during his career. 
In a very short time he has conquered the foreign policy area. 
  Latin America has become one of the areas in which Gore 
exercises influence since he decisively helped to guarantee the 
NAFTA agreement in 1993.

  [Excerpt] At the end of the First World Telecommunications 
Development Conference (WTDC/94) on 29 March, Brazil will sign a 
letter of principles on the expansion of international 
communications services. The Brazilian delegation that will 
attend the conference will be headed by Communications Minister 
Djalma de Moraes. Moraes, however, will not be present at the 
WTDC/94 opening ceremony on 21 March. 
  The conference will be opened by Argentine President Carlos 
Menem at the Sheraton Hotel in Buenos Aires. During the 
ceremony, U.S. Vice President Al Gore and ITU [International 
Telecommunications Union] Secretary General Pekka Tarjanne will 
deliver speeches. The conference's goal is to develop an overall 
strategy for telecommunications development for the year 2000. 
  The letter of principles, which already has been approved at 
the technical level by 183 member countries, is one of the ITU 
projects for the future. The ITU is a specialized UN agency that 
already has formed an international working group that deals 
with the reformulation of the international frequencies chart. 
Diplomat Flavio Sapha -- head of the communications minister's 
office -- reported that another of ITU's concerns is to organize 
the frequencies chart for cellular and satellite communications. 
He will leave for Buenos Aires this weekend accompanying the 
delegation comprised of Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications, 
Inc.] President Adyr da Silva and members of the Foreign 
Ministry's Division for Transportation, Communications, and 
Services. 
  The Buenos Aires meeting will be in preparation for the 
Kyoto 
(Japan) plenipotentiary conference to be held in September. 
Brazilian entrepreneurs, including members of the Alcatel and 
Motorola companies, also will attend the Buenos Aires meeting, 
but only as observers, Sapha said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Celso Pinto from Sao Paulo] </F>
  [Excerpts] Since interest rates on the U.S. market rose on 
4 February, the international market for Latin American 
securities has shrunk dramatically. Interest rates took a jump 
in absolute and relative terms, and international and Brazilian 
institutions had enormous losses. 
  After the initial panic, the market has stabilized in the 
past few days, but the loss was inevitable. It now remains to be 
seen whether it was only a regular adjustment of a market that 
has experienced an extraordinary rise for more than one year, or 
whether some basic conditions underwent lasting changes. 
  The manager of one of New York's most important 
international 
investment funds told GAZETA MERCANTIL that the market will 
recover "slowly and partially." He expects a "substantial drop" 
in Eurobonds and other securities offered by developing 
countries, including Brazil, for this year. He believes costs 
will rise and the financial flow reduction might affect stock 
market investment. [passage omitted] 
  Profits on debt certificates (the "Brady's") and Eurobonds 
from developing countries already have jumped significantly. The 
crisis was triggered by the increase in U.S. interest rates. 
Treasury 30-year securities, the market's most sensitive 
indicator, which were paying 6.3 percent at the end of January, 
jumped to 6.9 percent (on 9 March they were paying 6.85 percent). 
  Since T-bonds are the gauge, the basis of comparison for the 
market, it was only natural that the yield on all securities 
should have edged up. What happened, however, is that the 
increase was much higher than proportionate. Or in other words, 
the "spread" [preceding word in English] on securities from 
Latin American countries vis-a-vis T-bonds shifted gears. 
  This is obvious comparing quotations published by the U.S. 
investment bank Bear Stearns on 21 January, before the crisis, 
with the current ones. 
  In Brazil's case, the spread of bonds on interest in arrears 
(IDU [expansion unknown]) increased from 477 points to 600, the 
"exit bonds" [preceding two words in English] from 383 to 488, 
and the "new money bonds" [preceding three words in English] 
from 434 to 565. For Argentina the damages was even greater 
because the FRN's [expansion unknown] spread jumped from 302 to 
478. Even the spread on Mexican "discount bonds" went from 160 
to 232 points. 
  This increase also affected the quotation of Latin American 
Eurobonds in the secondary market. The "spread" on several 
Brazilian papers increased from 10 to 30 points. Bonds with 
longer maturity dates, in general, suffered even more. The 
spread on the bonds issued by the Argentine Republic worth $1 
billion, whose maturity day is now a little less than 10 years 
away, increased from 238 to 307 points. 
  In Brazil's case, a sector of the market believes the 
announcement of an agreement with the IMF might push prices up. 
The fact, however, is that during the past the arrival of some 
good news such as the approval of the Social Emergency Fund and 
the URV [Real Value Unit] helped cushion the increase compared 
to other countries such as Argentina and Venezuela, but did not 
avoid it. Combined rates on "Brady"-type papers show an average 
drop from 20 percent (Bloomberg) to 15 percent (West Merchant 
Bank) due to the crisis. 
  This is not the first crisis that has shaken the emerging 
markets. During the last quarter of 1992, Brady papers lost 
approximately 10 percent of their value due to the combination 
of the Brazilian political and economic crisis and the excess 
offer of Mexican papers. What is more worrisome today is the 
nature of the crisis. 
  International investors' renewed interest in the emerging 
Latin American markets was prompted by the combination of 
various factors, among which is the recovery of their economies. 
Anyhow, everybody agrees that a crucial factor was the major 
drop in U.S. interest rates, thus making them unattractive. 
Investing institutions such as the pension funds that must pay 
their clients a minimum 7 percent interest a year were forced to 
seek more risky alternatives that are, consequently, more 
profitable. 
  What made the bonds market drop (increasing the 
profitability 
of their papers) was not only the increase in U.S. short-term 
interest rates. The drop was caused by the signs that the very 
long cycle of low and dropping rates probably has ended. U.S. 
rates have increased because the rhythm of activities has been 
much greater than expected and this starts to push inflation up. 
As a banker stated: "Nobody says whether U.S. interest rates 
are going to increase; people only talk about how much and when 
they will increase." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vicenzo Buondonno, a 37-year-old Italian and member 
of the Mafia, was arrested on 15 March by agents from the 
Maritime, Air, and Border Police Precinct (DP-MAF) of the 
Federal Police. The warrant for his arrest was issued by the 
Federal Supreme Court at the request of the Italian Government, 
which has filed for his extradition. Buondonno, who is linked 
to the Camorra of Naples, was in charge of receiving drugs from 
other South American countries and shipping them to Europe as 
part of the so-called "Spaghetti Connection." 
  Buondonno, known as Enzo, is the son of Rosario Buondonno, 
one of the leading members of the Camorra. Edson Antonio de 
Oliveira, Federal Police director for Rio de Janeiro, reported 
that Buondonno had been spotted in Rio de Janeiro four months 
ago. He was subsequently kept under surveillance by the police 
until the warrant for his arrest was issued. 
  The mafioso was arrested when he was going to his apartment 
on 26 Barata Ribeiro Street, in the Copacabana district. The 
three Italians who accompanied him were released after being 
questioned by the Federal Police. Buondonno is one of the 
owners of the Baroni-Fasoli Restaurant located on Jangadeiros 
Street, in the Ipanema district. De Oliveira stated that 
Italian Mafia members "launder" drug money through their chains 
of restaurants -- hence the name "Spaghetti Connection." 
  The Federal Police also discovered that Buondonno has links 
with at least two other Italian Mafia members -- Humberto 
Amaturo, who broke away from the Brasilia Federal Police but was 
recaptured in Bolivia, and Marco Pugliese from the Sacra Corona 
Unita, who was taken into custody in Rio de Janeiro. 
  Because of the friendship between Buondonno and Pugliese the 
police are investigating the possibility of Italian Mafia groups 
having joined forces to facilitate drug trafficking. Buondonno 
may have something to do with the murder of Roberto Farina, one 
of the owners of the jewelry shop at the Copacabana Palace 
Hotel, who was killed in 1991.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The United Nations estimates that 
between 70 and 80 percent of the chemical substances used in 
processing cocaine in Peru and Bolivia are either manufactured 
in or shipped through Brazil. The statement was made yesterday 
by Herbert Schaepe, secretary of the UN International Board on 
Narcotic Drugs [Junta Internacional de Estupefacientes da ONU]. 
  Schaepe requested that Brazilian Justice Minister Mauricio 
Correa report on Brazilian compliance with three agreements on 
the control of drug production and use. 
  Noncompliance with these international agreements will make 
it difficult for Brazil to obtain resources to fight the drug 
trade. According to Schaepe, the opinion of the Board is 
important for the disbursement of these funds. 
  The Board -- which is headquartered in Vienna, Austria -- 
consists of 13 member countries, which will evaluate the 
Brazilian Government's reports. 
  The United Nations is concerned about Brazil having become a 
route for cocaine substances, as well as about the consumption 
in the country of 80 percent of the world production of 
Fenproporex, a basic appetite suppressant that causes physical 
and psychological dependence. 
  Fenproporex is an anorectic amphetamine that is used in 
Brazil, namely by drug stores filling up prescriptions issued by 
"obesity doctors" to patients who are seeking to lose weight. 
  In addition to dependence, Fenproporex causes irritability, 
depression, and increases the heartbeat. This drug is more 
dangerous when it is used with other pain relievers. 
  According to the United Nations, the Brazilian Government is 
not informing the Board about controls adopted in these two 
cases. 
  Justice Minister Correa said that the reports requested by 
the United Nations will be filed in the next few days. He noted 
that during the Collor administration the Health Ministry 
discontinued its controls over use of legal drugs such as 
appetite suppressants. He said the Brazilian Government is 
willing to comply with all of its agreements.

  [Text] A high-level Cuban Government mission officially 
signed last week a technological and scientific cooperation 
agreement with several Brazilian states. The agreement includes 
the exchange of teachers, researchers, and students between 
universities and institutes of the two countries, to expedite 
the training process in the areas of greatest scientific 
interest. 
  The Cuban mission, which was made up of Higher Education 
Minister Fernando Vecino Alegret, Higher Education Vice Minister 
Miguel Garrido, International Relations Director Fernando Rojas 
Avallos, and Matanzas University Rector Angel Vega, visited 
several Brazilian universities in the Brasilia Federal District, 
and in the states of Amazonas, Roraima, Rio de Janeiro, and Sao 
Paulo, to identify areas and possibilities for cooperation. 
  In the state of Sao Paulo, the mission's visit was 
coordinated by Roberto Muller Filho, secretary of science, 
technology, and economic development. Muller accepted the entry 
of 10 Cuban scientists as visiting professors to carry out 
research at the University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo State 
University (UNESP), and Campinas State University (Unicamp). 
The agreement also includes scholarships for Cuban students in 
Sao Paulo universities for masters degrees and Ph.D.'s, as well 
as for Brazilian professors from Sao Paulo agricultural 
technical schools to be trained in Cuba. 
  The main areas of knowledge for exchange are: molecular 
biology, civil construction materials, immunology, agriculture 
and livestock, health, education, physics, genetics, biology, 
energy, and biotechnology. Vecino said: "The main purpose of 
the scientific exchange with Brazil is to strengthen the 
postgraduate studies of Cuban professors." 
  He explained that Cuba has 46 universities with 24,000 
professors, of whom only 20 percent have doctorates. He added: 
"The goal is that at least 50 percent of that amount get their 
doctorates." 
  The Sao Paulo Science and Technology Secretariat will 
provide 
additional funds, along with the Sao Paulo Federation to Support 
Research (Fapesp), to finance the scholarships for the 
researchers and postgraduate students. Muller reported that the 
program will start with the arrival of 10 Cuban scientists to 
carry out joint research, who will get about $1,500 per month. 
  Cuban Minister Vecino also visited the Sao Paulo State 
Federation of Industries (FIESP) to evaluate the possibility of 
the transfer of business technology through associations. 
  As a result of the visit to the FIESP, a business delegation 
will visit Cuba in the first half of this year to identify the 
areas of interest.

  [Text] Brasilia, 16 Mar (EFE) -- A poll on vote preferences 
for the upcoming elections, carried out by the independent 
institute IBOPE [Brazilian Public Opinion and Statistics 
Institute] and published by the newspaper CORREIO BRASILIENSE 
today, indicates that Brazilian presidential candidate [Luiz] 
Inacio "Lula" da Silva is leading, with 31 percent of the 
preferences. 
  Da Silva, 48, the Workers Party (PT, socialist) leader and a 
lathe operator, has strong electoral support from poorly 
educated and poor Brazilians for the general elections of 3 
October. 
  IBOPE polled 2,000 potential voters between 5 and 10 March 
in 
various cities in our country, asking them about the 
presidential candidate they will support in the general 
elections. 
  According to the poll Jose Sarney, 64, ranks second in the 
vote preferences (with 13 percent) while Paulo Maluf, 63, mayor 
of Sao Paulo and a conservative leader, ranks third (with 10 
percent). 
  Social Democratic Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso, 62, the 
finance minister and architect of the economic stabilization 
program, ranks fourth (with 9 percent). 
  Da Silva has been fully engaged in the electoral campaign 
since last year; Maluf has announced he will quit the Sao Paulo 
mayoralty on 2 April to prepare his candidacy; and Sarney has 
pledged not to run for president in the next elections. 
  Even though he has still not confirmed his possible 
candidacy, Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) sources 
guarantee that Cardoso will resign from his post in late March 
to dedicate himself to his presidential candidacy. 
  About 100 million Brazilians will elect the president of the 
Republic, 513 federal deputies, 54 senators, 27 governors, and 
about 1,000 state legislators in the October elections.

<F P=106> [Article by Mario Chimanovitch] </F>
  [Text] The use of nuclear energy is by its nature a 
controversial issue. It becomes still more controversial when 
the discussion is about whether the government or the private 
sector should be in charge of nuclear activities. A document 
drafted by the Strategic Affairs Secretariat (SAE), to which 
this magazine had access, has added fuel to the atomic bonfire. 
SAE Memo No. 109, dated 11 February and signed by SAE head 
Admiral Mario Cesar Flores, favors the privatization of certain 
stages of the nuclear process and opposes the position 
traditionally defended by the Brazilian military of maintaining 
absolute government monopoly over the field. The document, which 
was handed to the SAE under secretary for plans and programs, 
was drafted to guide governmental action in the constitutional 
revision. It states: "There is no reason why private 
concessionaires should not be in charge of mining work, 
concentrates manufacturing, trade, and many other related 
activities. The same applies to electrical energy production." 
  Adm. Flores believes that one of the activities that could 
be 
performed by the private sector is nuclear fuel production. In 
his opinion, the government should only control the most 
sensitive sectors such as uranium enrichment. Private companies 
could, for example, participate in uranium mining or import 
certain components for the final fuel. He points out, however, 
that the National Nuclear Energy Commission [CNEN], i.e. the 
government, must preserve "its regulatory, supervisory, and 
licensing" role. He also suggests that the civilian sector 
should accompany nuclear activities through the establishment -- 
by the national Congress -- of a joint committee. This 
suggestion is in accordance with another bill proposed by Flores 
to reorganize the intelligence service, which also would be 
closely followed by a joint committee established by Congress. 
  Several countries such as the United States and France have 
adopted the policy of partially privatizing nuclear projects. 
Nonetheless, many still criticize Flores' proposal. Professor 
Bernardino Pontes, who acted as surveyor of the 
Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
for 12 years, said: "The so-called nuclear fuel cycle must 
remain in Brazilian hands to protect it from international 
oligopolies." Pontes agrees nonetheless that private enterprises 
can be more effective in mining. He insists, however, that they 
should work under CNEN control "because there is a great deal of 
international greed now that Brazil is beginning to stand out in 
the extremely select club of countries that have nuclear 
technology." 
  In the opinion of Everton Carvalho, vice president of the 
Brazilian Nuclear Energy Association (Aben), Flores' proposal 
makes Brazil vulnerable. "The most serious thing is that the end 
of the monopoly would make it easy for foreign groups to 
accurately design a chart of our reserves," he said. It is 
believed that Brazilian uranium reserves total 280,000 metric 
tons. 
  Former CNEN President Rex Nazareth, who is a colonel and an 
engineer, believes the private sector's resources might 
contribute to reducing Brazilian backwardness in the nuclear 
field. 
  Another expert, Brigadier Sergio Xavier Ferolla -- who has 
been director of the Sao Jose dos Campos Aerospace Technical 
Center and is now commander of the Superior War College -- 
believes the government should give up only its monopoly over 
uranium exploitation. He includes the nuclear field among those 
that have "a highly strategic role and should therefore remain 
under government control on behalf of Brazilian sovereignty and 
society's interests." 
  In the eye of the storm, Adm. Flores remains calm and 
asserts 
that most of the controversy results from a "misunderstanding." 
Be as it may, the situation will become hotter this year because 
Brazil's strategic interests in the nuclear field will be 
analyzed by the Superior War College. This makes us forecast a 
new -- and more serious -- confrontation among those who defend 
and those who oppose absolute governmental monopoly over the 
nuclear field.

  [Text] Brasilia, 16 Mar (EFE) -- Police sources have 
reported that two policemen and 12 students were slightly 
wounded when demonstrating students attempted to occupy the 
Finance Ministry in Brasilia today. 
  The incidents began when some 500 students -- who were 
demonstrating against the government's recent economic measures 
and against the constitutional reform in the area of the 
ministry buildings -- arrived at the Finance Ministry building. 
  Instigated by leaders of the National Union of Students 
(UNE), a group of demonstrators attempted to invade the building 
of the ministry, which had promoted the economic measures 
lifting restrictions on the installments paid to private schools 
and universities. 
  For approximately 30 minutes the demonstrators confronted 
200 
military policemen who were guarding the building. A number of 
windows were broken by the stones thrown by the students. 
  Two policemen and 12 students suffered injuries of a minor 
nature, although 8 of the demonstrators did need to be seen at a 
Brasilia area hospital.

  [Text] Army Minister General Zenildo Gonzaga Zoroastro de 
Lucena stated in Parana State that the military can build 
highways and railways in order to help the government economize. 
The minister visited a railway being built through a partnership 
agreed on by the state and Army. 
  In peacetime, Army personnel leave their barracks and change 
weapons. Some 100 soldiers are building the remaining 200 km of 
the Ferroeste railway linking the Parana's main agricultural 
region with the port of Paranagua. 
  It was up to the construction company to build it, but the 
state government canceled the bid and resorted to the Army when 
it discovered that it would be cheaper. 
  The construction of the tunnel that is the railway's most 
difficult segment is an example of the savings. The construction 
companies raised its cost to $1.8 million. The Army built the 
400 meter tunnel for $700,000, which represents a savings of 
approximately 800 million real cruzeiros. 
  The government thinks that when the work ends in December, 
Parana State will save $40 million, almost 60 billion real 
cruzeiros. 
  Lucena, who visited the railway, said the Army can cooperate 
on other projects:

  [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso has said 
he will not authorize the wage increase for deputies and 
Judicial Branch employees even if the Senate approves it. The 
minister said that he must obey the law, but within the 
limitations of the defense of national interests. 
  Minister Cardoso described the attitude of the deputies as 
sabotage to the country. He regretted that his party, the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party] did not walk out of the 
plenary while the presidential veto on the wage increases were 
voted. 
  Cardoso said that, despite the serious attitude of 
congressmen, there is no reason to speak of closing Congress. 
The minister considered the attitude of military men as 
exemplary. He does not believe, however, that the irresponsible 
behavior of congressmen should be a pretext to attack democracy 
or Congress as an institution.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 20 Mar (EFE) -- The government 
and the Socialist Renewal Movement (CRS) guerrilla group, which 
represents approximately 600 men, 300 of whom are still armed, 
will sign a final peace accord on 9 April. On Saturday, 19 
March, government and CRS representatives were able to iron out 
the final differences that had stopped the negotiations and 
reach a specific agreement on all the topics discussed. "As a 
result of this and in order to adjust the details of the 
ceremony whereby the CRS will lay down its weapons and rejoin 
civilian society, the signing of the final Political Accord will 
take place on 9 April in Monte Flor, Ovejas Municipality, Sucre 
Department," the communique signed by the two sides said. In 
the eight-point agreement, the government pledges to give the 
CRS two seats in the House of Representatives and, possibly, 
another in the Senate. The eight points agreed on refer to human 
rights, citizen participation, economic consensus, regional 
development, legal benefits, political advantages 
[favorabiliades], reincorporation, and the surrender of weapons. 
  CRS spokesmen voiced their satisfaction with the agreement 
reached and called on active rebel groups to hold talks with the 
government and seek alternatives of peace. The CRS disbanding 
process began a year ago when a dissident ELN [Army of National 
Liberation] group publicly expressed its desire to talk and 
surrender its weapons. At that time, the CRS had rejected the 
orthodox leadership of Manuel Perez, a Spanish former priest, 
kidnappings, and indiscriminate violence as a guerrilla warfare 
strategy. The process experienced its biggest setback last 
September when leaders Enrique Buendia and Ricardo Gonzalez were 
murdered. These men, who were unarmed and had special 
authorization from civilian authorities, were getting ready to 
make contact with other comrades in arms when the Army detained 
and killed them.

  [Text] In the next few hours, Cuban Ambassador to Colombia 
Jesus Martinez will officially deliver to the Colombian Foreign 
Ministry, Cuban President Fidel Castro's answer to a request 
sent last Thursday [17 March] asking the Cuban Government to say 
whether [guerrilla leaders] Alfonso Cano, Ivan Marquez, and 
Sincelejo Bishop Nel Beltran had participated in an alleged 
guerrilla summit and the Fourth Meeting of Solidarity of Latin 
American People with Cuba, according to reports by EL TIEMPO of 
Bogota. 
  As Caracol reported, Friday afternoon Fidel Castro told 
Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin that after having 
reviewed the list of participants to the Fourth Meeting of 
Solidarity, watching videos of the meeting, and looking at 
pictures that were taken of the event, the Cuban Government is 
able to guarantee -- his word of honor at stake -- that Ivan 
Marquez, Alfonso Cano, or Sincelejo Bishop Nel Beltran were not 
at that meeting, much less a guerrilla summit. Fidel Castro also 
denied that his government has given the Colombian Guerrilla 
Coordinating Board an office so it can carry out subversive 
operations in Colombia. 
  Caracol can also confirm that reliable sources have reported 
that the alleged evidence and proof of subversive leaders 
participating in the alleged Havana summit given to the 
Colombian Government by the Prosecutor General's Office were 
based solely on statements by a nun, who had gone to the 
Prosecutor General's Office and offered her testimony. In her 
statement, she says she believes she saw Nel Beltran at that 
conference, that he was a person that looked very much like a 
person she had met in our country. 
  This is too flimsy, too weak a testimony and will probably 
be 
considered meaningless in the next few hours once it is 
established that the nun's testimony saying she saw Nel Beltran 
and the guerrilla leaders in Havana is the only testimony of 
that kind. 
  The embarrassing situation caused by EL TIEMPO will be 
resolved this week and relations will not be broken. The Gaviria 
administration will find President Fidel Castro's explanation 
satisfactory, and that will be the end of it.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 21 Mar (EFE) -- Today, Monday, 
Colombian Government Minister Fabio Villegas said that as long 
as there is no irrefutable proof on the alleged Colombian 
guerrilla summit in Havana, Colombia will continue to believe 
Cuba, which adamantly denies it. In the Caribbean city of 
Cartagena de Indias, the minister said: "What we know is that 
the Cuban Government is maintaining its former position, 
previously stated to our ambassador in Cuba, meaning the 
guerrilla summit was not held there." Villegas emphasized: "We 
believe that as long as we do not have enough evidence proving 
otherwise, we obviously have to believe the Cuban Government." 
  On Saturday, media sources reported that Cuban President 
Fidel Castro denied his government had sponsored a meeting of 
Colombian guerrilla leaders on the island. He reaffirmed his 
pledge to Colombia, in other words, to not interfere in its 
internal affairs. Castro ruled out the possibility various 
Colombian guerrilla leaders had participated in the Fourth Latin 
American and Caribbean Meeting for People's Solidarity and 
Self-Determination, held late in January in Havana. 
  The Colombian Government demanded an explanation from the 
Cuban Government on the alleged presence of Guerrilla 
Coordinating Board (CG) leaders in Cuba, and it warned that 
relations between the two countries would suffer a great setback 
if the rumor was confirmed. 
  Castro talked with Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin 
over the telephone and said he had ordered an investigation, 
while adding that he had individually verified all the names of 
the people who attended the solidarity meeting so he could 
guarantee with certainty that there were no guerrilla members. 
  On Thursday, Sanin said that based on information received 
from the Attorney General's Office, "we have serious evidence 
that Cuba possibly welcomed the guerrilla members, who 
apparently participated in a political summit."

  [Text] The United States has not suspended the exchange of 
evidence and judicial information with Colombia, Ambassador to 
Washington Gabriel Silva Lujan said today, denying reports by 
international news agencies concerning such a suspension. 
  The diplomat said that on the contrary, new cooperation 
systems are being studied in the antidrug-trafficking struggle. 
  According to the ambassador, although there are some 
differences of criteria between our government and the United 
States over the policy of bringing drug traffickers to justice, 
no break in the exchange of judicial information has taken place. 
  [Begin Silva recording] I do not think this decision has 
been 
made, because until recently we have maintained an open and 
clear dialogue with U.S. authorities. At no time has this 
possibility been mentioned. 
  I have maintained frequent and close contact with U.S. 
authorities. During none of the official or informal meetings I 
have held with them have they informed me of such a decision. 
[end recording] 
  In the meantime, the attorney general has defended 
Prosecutor 
General de Greiff's administration and said that the two 
countries are perfecting the judicial cooperation system. 
  [Begin recording] [Attorney General Arrieta] The fact of the 
matter is that there are many people who would be interested in 
blocking this cooperation process. On one occasion I have said 
criminals are the only ones to fish in these troubled waters. 
  [Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez] There have been 
differences that are known to the public, but I trust we can 
embark on a great effort to create an atmosphere that favors the 
much-needed judicial cooperation in the international area.

  With the Liberal tradition of having been the president and 
the party leader, former President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala is 
retiring with the recognition of his fellow countrymen because 
he united them and promoted clean primary elections for choosing 
the candidate for president of the Republic. 
  [Begin Turbay Ayala recording] With the change in leadership 
of the party we complete the cycle of a generational renewal

  Next week PL presidential candidate Ernesto Samper Pizano 
will form the new groups for his electoral campaign.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota -- Cuban President Fidel Castro 
today flatly denied that there is any truth to the report that 
Ivan Marquez, Alfonso Cano, and Monsignor Nel Beltran met in 
Cuba during the second half of January. 
  Castro said that the report is nothing but more pressure by 
groups interested in hindering the sale of Colombian petroleum 
to Cuba and hastening the break of diplomatic relations between 
the two countries. 
  Castro made the statement prior to an official announcement 
in which he will respond to a Colombian Foreign Ministry request 
for clarification on the Solidarity Summit in Cuba. He pointed 
out that a Protestant prelate who currently lives in Medellin 
attended this meeting on behalf of Colombia. 
  Meanwhile, Ernesto Samper Pizano, the official presidential 
candidate of the Liberal Party, reacted by advising against any 
desperate actions and saying that we should listen carefully to 
the explanations given by the Cuban Government.

  [Text] "The elections of the century" are now part of 
history, and for the international community El Salvador has 
opted for the thorough development of its democratic progress. 
  This was confirmed by more than 3,000 international 
observers 
who were at the polling sites throughout the country. They were 
there since the Voting Table Boards were installed up until the 
time the vote count was carried out by the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal in the Presidente Hotel. 
  From Perquin, Morazan, Venezuelan Enrique Ter Horst, who 
will 
be the new UN Observers for El Salvador (Onusal) chief, has told 
PRENSA GRAFICA "the patience with which the electoral process 
was carried out and the people's will and determination to vote 
made us realize a page has been turned in El Salvador's history, 
inaugurating a new, truly democratic and participative era." 
  Onusal participated with 900 representatives from 52 
countries. 
  As did the rest of the delegates, the missions observed 
aspects such as voter registration, the supply of electoral 
equipment, the composition of the Voting Table Boards and any 
delays in their installation, and in ballot receipts. 
  Reports will be officially presented during the week. 
  The international observers were made up mostly of official 
missions, such as the U.S. Mission headed by Brian Atwood, the 
AID administrator who claimed to be "very satisfied at having 
thus reaffirmed U.S. support for the consolidation of the 
democratic process in El Salvador." 
  The importance of these elections brought to our country 
observers who do not belong to established organizations. Many 
are members of churches and student groups, as is the case of 
the Moecen (Mission of Electoral Observers of U.S. Citizens), 
which had 500 delegates. Four of the delegates were U.S. 
congressmen. 
  "Our commitment demonstrates support for the people's 
decision and wish to carry out an important role in securing 
peace," U.S. Democratic Congressman Dan Hamburg of California, 
said. 
  Attending personalities included Ignacio Lozano (1976-77) 
and 
Edwin Corr (1985-88), former U.S. ambassadors to EL Salvador. 
  "I can view the process positively. Now nobody can voice 
criticism there is any sector without a voice or without the 
right to participate in political activities in El Salvador," 
Corr stated. He witnessed the elections in Suchitoto, Cuscatlan. 
  The international observation of elections is relatively new 
and was born from an initiative of the international community, 
after certain governments or parties engaged in the armed 
conflict decided to move toward a democratic development.

  [Text] Panama will seek a consensus for getting the U.S. 
Congress to approve the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty [MLAT]. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Now that the 
elections are near, do you think this will delay the U.S. 
Congress in approving MLAT? We have not yet received any answer 
to that effect. 
  [Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino] I am leaving for 
Washington on Wednesday to have some bilateral conversations 
with U.S. State Department officials and some congressmen. I 
have requested an appointment with Senator Helms, the 
undersecretary of state for Latin American Affairs, and the 
secretary of the Panama Canal Commission Board of Directors to 
officially talk about topics of mutual interest. This treaty is 
obviously one of these topics. I do not see why our electoral 
process should interfere with the Senate approving the treaty, 
which should be an urgent issue because of the importance of the 
document to the bilateral mechanism that it establishes between 
our two governments and both nations' goals for the fight 
against drugs. 
  [Reporter] Apparently the U.S. Government is not aware of 
that urgency because there has not been any reply so far. 
  [Mulino] I would not say that about the U.S. Government. The 
government as such, the executive branch, did what it had to do: 
negotiate and sign the treaty. 
  [Reporter] Is it the Senate then? 
  [Mulino] It is in the hands of the Senate, and it is up to 
the legislative branch to do its work. That is precisely the 
purpose of my visit. I am going to talk with them; explain that 
we are interested in it becoming a mechanism that will very 
shortly become law. We will exchange the documents whereby both 
senates [as heard] ratify it, and then we will proceed to 
implement it. I think it is a very effective and good measure 
for collaborating in the fight against drugs and similar crimes.

Carles, presidential candidate of the Civic Renewal Party, 
National Renewal Movement, and Nationalist Liberal Republican 
Movement, with students from the Technological University, Santa 
Maria La Antigua, and the University of Panama at the station's 
studios; moderated by Ricardo Samaniego; from the "Young Vote 
'94" program -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Samaniego] Good evening, Professor Carles, and 
welcome to "Young Vote '94." We are accompanied by students 
from the three universities: the Technological University, Santa 
Maria La Antigua, and the University of Panama. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Samaniego] Here is student [first name not given] Armuelles 
of Santa Maria La Antigua University. 
  [Armuelles] Good evening, professor. We all know that 
history is written by the winners. Former governments have 
traditionally used primary and secondary school textbooks to 
record their own interpretation of history. I would like to 
know how your administration will interpret the 21 years of 
military government, and particularly the U.S. invasion. 
  [Carles] I believe that history is obvious, but it must be 
made public knowledge. There was an obscure period here when 
things were not communicated to the people; they were not 
informed. We must reveal the facts so each person can draw his 
own conclusions. 
  [Armuelles] But Professor, something is missing. What about 
the U.S. invasion? What interpretation will be made of that? 
  [Carles] It depends. Some say it was an invasion; others say 
it was a liberation. The truth is that if U.S. troops had not 
arrived, a military boot would still be trampling us. I was 
exiled for eight years. I hadn't done anything but speak in 
defense of liberty. At that time, anyone who spoke in defense 
of liberty was put behind bars, buried, or exiled. I was exiled 
on two occasions. The military problem intensified. It called 
for a military operation so the Panamanian people could rid 
themselves of that opprobrious, corrupt, and inefficient 
dictatorship. Otherwise, we would still be saddled with it. 
  [Samaniego] [passage omitted] Student Corina Cano of the 
University of Panama. 
  [Cano] Good evening. Your platform says Panama should lease 
the bases to the United States in exchange for an opening of 
U.S. markets to Panamanian products after the year 2000. 
Wouldn't that be the same as not receiving any direct benefit 
from the lease? There are other commercial mechanisms that 
permit the exportation of Panamanian products to U.S. markets, 
such as NAFTA, which Panama has joined [as heard], and the 
Caribbean Basin Initiative, of which Panama has been a 
beneficiary. 
  [Carles] It could take us a long time to join NAFTA because 
of the negotiation process and difficulties we might have in 
meeting some of the conditions. I propose an agreement parallel 
to a free trade agreement in which we would have access to 
certain products in specifically assigned quantities with the 
purpose of increasing investment and jobs in Panama. When there 
is an opportunity to market a product, it attracts investment 
and generates jobs. Nobody is going to invest or produce if 
there is no possibility of exporting. For example, if we had 
such an agreement, and they told us that we were going to export 
1 million quintals of sugar or 2 million quintals of sugar for a 
given period of time, within one year Panamanian sugar mills 
would increase the amount of land used for sugarcane 
plantations. Also, the period for sugarcane harvesting and 
production would increase. I could cite certain cases in which 
we could generate jobs. The purpose of this is to generate 
jobs, to increase production, to increase the income of 
Panamanians, because we have an established market. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Friday after five hours of negotiations between the 
leader of the 3-80 Northern Front and the Government Ministry, 
it was agreed that as of today the demobilization process would 
resume. This process should conclude by 25 March. The final 
disarmament will take place on 8 April taking into account, as 
Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta and rebel leader Jose Angel 
Talavera have reported, the gradual demobilization because some 
details, like acquiring land and implementing emergency 
employment programs for Talavera's demobilized men, have yet to 
be worked out. 
  Government Minister Mendieta reported that a member of the 
Northern Front will join the Interinstitutional Commission 
supervising the rebels disarmament in the country's north.

  [Text] Assistant Agriculture Secretary Luis Tellez Kuezler 
has informed the Follow-Up Commission for the Stability, 
Competitiveness, and Employment Pact that worldwide agricultural 
trade is undergoing one of its most calamitous times in history, 
and he added that Mexico's agricultural trade is no exception. 
  Citing a study, he pointed out that in 1993 the volume of 
international agricultural-livestock trade fell, and this trend 
is expected to continue, constituting a shortfall for Mexico, 
despite the prospects for growth opened by GATT and NAFTA. 
  In addition to a drop in global demand prompted by the 
demise 
of the defunct Soviet Union, the major exporting countries are 
maintaining subsidy policies that cause serious distortions in 
the international market, pushing prices of most 
agricultural-livestock products to their lowest levels in 
history. 
  Once GATT's Uruguay Round agreements and various global 
agreements such as NAFTA are consolidated, the distortions in 
the market should give way to price increases. 
  The Mexican situation is not promising. Although 1993's 
agricultural-livestock trade deficit ($121.4 million) was lower 
than the one for 1992 ($761.4 million), the expanded [ampliada] 
agricultural-livestock trade balance presents one of the highest 
deficits in history, even higher than for the period of the lost 
decade [reference to Latin America's economic problems of the 
1980's]. 
  Although some exports are increasing, including legumes, 
fresh vegetables, cattle, tomato, fresh fruits, and coffee, the 
expanded agricultural-livestock trade balance has reached $2.3 
billion.

<F P=106> [Commentary by announcer Carlos Mesa] </F>
  [Text] The brief visit [by U.S. Vice President Al Gore] -- 
like all visits by U.S. personalities who never have enough time 
for a small country like ours, or even for countries like 
Argentina and Brazil, for which there are but a couple of hours 
in the middle of a huge show -- has left us some lessons. 
  The U.S. vice president -- in this regard we agree with some 
of the viewpoints that were raised by the press today -- 
probably gave us two messages. On the one hand, the U.S. 
position on the antinarcotics fight has not budged an inch. 
There have been neither essential nor substantive changes 
between the Bush and Clinton administrations. 
  The U.S. ambassador soon realized that the coca leaf garland 
[given to Gore upon getting off the plane] was a hot issue, and 
asked the vice president to get rid of it. Gore wore it for 
barely a few seconds. This clearly shows the U.S. position. 
Drug trafficking, coca, and production remain vital and 
essential and, unfortunately, decisive factors in bilateral 
relations. 
  Yet a second, positive message, in which we may find the 
most 
important point of this visit, is that sustainable development, 
the environment, and the preservation of ecological balance in a 
region that is so important as the Amazonas, is of the utmost 
importance for the United States, and especially for the U.S. 
vice president. 
  In Santa Cruz, Gore ratified his support for the 
construction 
of a gas pipeline to Sao Paulo, Brazil, for conveying clean 
energy for that very important Latin American city. He also 
supported a set of projects that could become an option. 
  I do not know whether the development of ecology, or rather 
I 
should say the preservation of the environment, will become as 
important as the coca issue. I don't believe so. Yet it is a 
point on the agenda that can produce some changes, or give a 
different touch to this dreadful and conditioned relation that 
coca has produced between Bolivia and the United States.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 21 Mar (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
has asserted that the approval of the new law on pharmaceutical 
patents does not represent "a full requirement" by the United 
States on Argentina's entry into NAFTA. 
  The chief of state said it is "merely a sort of warning 
regarding our relationship." 
  "We are doing the same over (agricultural) subsidies: We are 
telling the United States that they cannot continue to subsidize 
the sale of wheat to Brazil because it causes huge damage to 
Argentina." 
  Menem said this during an impromptu news conference granted 
at the press room at Government House, shortly before receiving 
U.S. Vice President Albert Gore.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 21 Mar (NA) -- U.S. Vice President 
Albert Gore's presence in Argentina has escalated controversy on 
the approval of a law on the protection of intellectual rights 
on pharmaceutical patents and has awakened the local 
laboratories that insisted on championing their interests. 
  Representatives from Argentine laboratories, the Argentine 
Industrial Center of Pharmaceutical Laboratories (CILFA), and 
foreign laboratories, the Chamber of Pharmaceutical Specialties 
[Camara de Especialidades Medicinales] (CAEME) have agreed in 
rejecting the possibility that the U.S. Government will apply 
sanctions against our country if an official bill, scheduled for 
discussion in Congress, is not promulgated before 30 April. 
  In remarks to NA, Felix Rozanski of the Studies Center for 
the Development of the Argentine Chemical-Pharmaceutical 
Industry [Centro de Estudios para el Desarrollo de la Industria 
Quimico Farmaceutica Argentina] (CEDIQUIFA), a CAEME member, 
noted: "Argentina will faithfully abide by the agreements signed 
before. Therefore, it is totally out of context to talk about 
sanctions -- which are the last step in negotiations, not the 
first." 
  Rozanski stressed that Gore "is coming to build, not to 
fight." He added that he does not believe "in the magic 30 April 
deadline." 
  In remarks to NA, CILFA President Pablo Challu emphasized 
that he does not believe the United States will place sanctions 
on our country. He accused the foreign laboratories of 
"formally" asking the U.S. Government to apply measures against 
local manufacturers. 
  Challu noted that the Clinton administration's sanctions 
might involve limiting exports from other sectors not involved 
in the controversy. 
  Challu believes the selected deadline is not imaginary 
because the 117 countries that approved the GATT agreement will 
sign it in April. The definition by the U.S. organization UCTR 
[expansion unknown] of the implementation of trade pressure 
measures also becomes due in April. 
  In this exchange of accusations, Rozanski stressed that "a 
small group of families and courtly entrepreneurs ill advise" 
government officials and legislators and prevent the official 
bill, scheduled for discussion in Congress, from being approved. 
  Nevertheless, Rozanski expressed hopes Argentina's current 
policy will remain faithful to all the bilateral negotiations 
and agreements achieved with the U.S. Government. He stressed: 
"The delay is inconsistent." 
  Rozanski charged: "The parties benefiting from the current 
system, namely a few families, are distributing unclear 
information and implementing a strong lobby [preceding word in 
English] to prevent the bill's approval." 
  Rozanski noted that the bill's approval will encourage 
exports. He pointed out that CILFA "is passing the ball, 
ignoring treaties already signed." 
  Rozinski emphasized that even though the patents law 
"represents a precondition for Argentina's entry into NAFTA and 
urges the patents law's discussion, it is important for our 
country to respect commitments entered before." 
  CILFA prepared itself for the possible "onslaughts" that may 
be prompted by Al Gore's arrival this week with a paid 
advertisement that was published today by our country's main 
morning newspapers. 
  In it, CILFA asks U.S. Ambassador James Cheek "not to 
invalidate signed agreements." 
  In this exchange of accusations of lobbies [preceding word 
in 
English] and influences, Challu indicated that 117 countries 
reached agreement on intellectual rights within the Uruguay 
Round of GATT. He pointed out that these measures "are the ones 
we must respect." 
  Challu stressed: "There are two basic differences: First, 
the 
GATT guidelines establish a 10-year transition period for the 
implementation of any rules and regulations." 
  Despite all these urgent considerations, Congress has not 
yet 
decided on this issue and not even the most optimistic believe 
the official bill will be discussed before 10 April. 
  Both Ambassador Cheek and Foreign Ministry sources admitted 
that the approval of this law represents a basic step for 
Argentina's entry into NAFTA.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Eduardo Lins da Silva] </F>
  [Text] Washington -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore, Jr. today 
begins a lightning visit to South America. In less than 48 
hours he will visit Bolivia, Argentina, and Brazil. In 
Brasilia, where he will stay for six hours tomorrow evening, he 
will meet with President Itamar Franco, attend a meeting with 
Brazilian society representatives, and have dinner with Minister 
Celso Amorim. 
  That is very little time to make any decision of great 
impact. In any case, in order to avoid making his presence in 
the country a mere matter of protocol, Brazilian diplomats are 
earnestly working to give it some meaning, and it is almost 
certain that one of the results of his visit will be the 
reactivation of a science and technology agreement between the 
two countries that has been paralyzed for years. 
  The agreement never went beyond a piece of paper because of 
several bilateral litigations in the past few years in this 
field (informatics and intellectual property rights). Given 
that the patents rights issue was solved last month and the 
U.S.-Brazilian agenda cleared in that subject, it is very 
probable that after the meeting between Gore and Franco the 
decision to activate the agreement will be announced. 
  Another sure subject of conversation between Gore and Franco 
is the Americas Summit scheduled for December in Miami. This is 
a very bad date for Brazil, which will be represented by a 
president (Itamar Franco) who has hardly a few weeks of 
government ahead of him. It will be the first meeting of 
continental chiefs of state since the Punta del Este meeting in 
1967, and the first summit in history with the presence of 
presidents only elected in free elections (the only two American 
countries that do not fit this definition -- Cuba and Haiti 
--were not invited).

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Garcia, Mabel Barreto, Jose Arrieta, and </F>
Julia Maria Urrunaga: "The Green Runway"] 
  [Text] "Vaticano" had two main accomplices: the Shining 
Path [SL] during one phase and prominent military officials in 
Alto Huallaga during another. However, the drug traffickers will 
be tried by the military courts and the commanding officer of 
the Army has already stated that no one in the military is 
involved. 
  Landing strip used by drug traffickers in Campanilla: The 
encircled area of the photo shows the Peruvian Army's Otorongo 
Military Base used for antiterrorist operations. For the past 
year, it has been used by small planes carrying drugs to 
Colombia in plain sight of the soldiers based there. It was 
built by Vaticano. 
  Although public opinion has for the past two weeks had ears 
for nothing but the alleged connections of drug trafficker 
Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera with prominent figures in the world 
of entertainment, a disturbing question nevertheless keeps 
cropping up with respect to this shady individual: Was he or was 
he not connected with members of the Armed Forces and Peru's 
National Police (PNP)? 
  Last week, Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, head of the Army, and 
PNP 
General Victor Alva Plasencia both emphatically denied that 
anyone in the military or police has had connections with Chavez 
Penaherrera. 
  Nevertheless, in the midst of the confusion caused by police 
arrests of entertainers, stars, a designer and a former beauty 
queen, rumors and suspicion that members of the Armed Forces or 
the Peruvian Police might be involved in Chavez Penaherrera's 
drug trafficking ring continued to grow. 
  Despite the amount of time that has passed, people still 
have 
vivid memories of the connections of drug trafficker Reynaldo 
Rodriguez Lopez, the "Godfather," with high-ranking National 
Police officials still serving prison terms. 
  So far, statements by (retired) Peruvian Army Major Evaristo 
Castillo Aste published in CARETAS last week provide the first 
indications that would detract from the categorical statements 
made by top-ranking PNP and Army officials to the effect that no 
one in the military or Police is involved with Chavez 
Penaherrera. 
  In the jungle, (retired) Major Castillo Aste served first of 
all as chief of operations and later military adviser to General 
Eduardo Bellido, now political and military head of the Huallaga 
Front. 
  What he said is deserving of an investigation as thorough as 
it must be transparent in order to assess the responsibilities 
of those serving at and assigned to the various military and 
Police bases near the area in which Chavez Penaherrera operated 
in Huallaga Valley. 
  Chavez Penaherrera is unquestionably one of the biggest--if 
not the biggest--drug traffickers in the country. There is also 
some suspicion about his connections with terrorists in the 
area. However, what is particularly troublesome in this case is 
that there does not appear to be the slightest interest on the 
part of either the military or the Police in investigating 
possible cases of corruption committed by members of law 
enforcement agencies. 
  Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano," has already been accused 
of treason on charges of narcoterrorism. His case is being 
channeled almost automatically to the military courts, where he 
is awaited by a faceless court that will certainly sentence him 
to life in prison. 
  Naturally, when he is turned over to the military courts, 
the 
regular courts of law will be powerless to conduct 
investigations, not only into Vaticano's probable relations with 
members of the Armed Forces and the PNP, but also with 
nonmilitary and nonpolice sectors. 
  The following is a thorough examination of the connections 
that very possibly link Vaticano with certain military and 
Police figures. 
  The information comes from thoroughly reliable sources and, 
as the reader will see, the accuracy and details speak for the 
quality and veracity of the information. 
<H5>  Looking the Other Way </H5>
  Kilometer marker 787 on the Juanjui-Tocache section of 
Marginal Highway in the Department of San Martin, which between 
1990 and mid-1993 was one of the airports set up by Vaticano to 
send cocaine paste (PBC) to Colombia, was not concealed in any 
way. 
  It could not be because located at the end of the 
1,500-meter 
airstrip used by small planes from Colombia is (now blockaded by 
cement barriers and barbed wire) the Peruvian Army's Otorongo 
Military Base used for antiterrorist operations. Both the strip 
and base are next to the town of Campanilla. The base has been 
there, manned by (approximately) 40 soldiers under the command 
of a captain, since before 1989. 
  In other words, there could not have been a single flight, 
shipment of cocaine paste, or takeoff or landing by Colombian 
planes in Campanilla that was not observed by personnel at that 
military base. To deny such complicity, which we shall describe 
in further detail below, would amount to saying that a small 
plane can land in Lima's city square without being seen by 
soldiers guarding the government buildings. 
  The captains assigned to the Campanilla Military Base (and 
who are rotated every three or four months) are not the only 
officers responsible. Their chiefs, who visited the base 
periodically, could not possibly have been unaware of what was 
going on. 
  Even if they did not observe the landings, when making their 
inspections, the officers must have at least wondered what was 
taking place on the 1,500-meter strip! 
  Nor did all the action take place in Campanilla. Nearly all 
the runways built or set up by Vaticano were near military 
bases. Most were run by the Army, as in the case of Tingo Maria, 
Aucayacu, Tocache, Juanjui, Sion, Punta Arenas, Uchiza, Saposoa, 
Bellavista, and Palmapampa. The Peruvian Air Force (FAP) now has 
its own bases at Tingo Maria, Tocache, Juanjui, Uchiza, Saposoa, 
and Bellavista. The Navy has a base at Aguaytia, where a secret 
airport also once operated. 
  The responsibility extends to the highest-ranking officers 
in 
the Armed Forces in the area: the commanding officers of 
Emergency Zone 8 (San Martin and Huanuco) between 1990 and 1993. 
  According to information gathered by this periodical in the 
area and contained in more than one report drafted by members of 
the Army Intelligence Service (as on 22 November 1991, for 
example), the complicity between the chief of the Otorongo Base 
and Vaticano's ring was the result of a financial agreement 
involving at least $3,000 to $4,000 a flight. If one considers 
that not only the captains in charge of the base, but their 
superior officers also consented to the goings-on, then one has 
to conclude--and this is the information that circulates in the 
area--that these superior officers also took payments and in 
larger quantities. 
<H5>  Life in Campanilla </H5>
  The operation run in Campanilla that turned the town into 
the 
biggest center for collections and shipments in Huallaga 
involved most of its 3,111 inhabitants. 
  It is perhaps for that very reason that no one wants to 
speak 
of what was happening in the local streets until only very 
recently. It is as if the entire town had suddenly suffered an 
attack of amnesia. 
  However, Army intelligence reports--which no one heeded at 
the proper time--and accounts gathered in Juanjui can 
reconstruct what the people of Campanilla do not wish to recall: 
  The activity began at the collection centers. The peasants 
went straight to certain homes in town. For example, the house 
where Humberto Chavez Penaherrera lived is on the second block 
of the Julio Romero Castro section, the street running right 
into Campanilla, about 150 meters from the base. 
  The building belongs to his brother, Emilio Chavez 
Penaherrera, who lives on Block 3 of the Alfonso Ugarte section 
in Juanjui, where SI found him. He said he has not seen his 
brother Demetrio since the latter was 15 and ran away from home 
in Campanilla (the Chavez Penaherrera family moved from Saposoa 
to Campanilla when Vaticano was 9) and swore he knew nothing 
about his other siblings Humberto, Bertha, or Bersabe. "We have 
all gone our separate ways and I know nothing about the others," 
he said. 
  The only thing he admitted was that he has a house in 
Campanilla where his brother Humberto lived until his arrest 
late last year: "I left it when I came here from there eight 
years ago to devote all my time to running my lumber business," 
he said. 
  Vaticano was not living in Campanilla. He moved to Colombia 
in 1990 but returned frequently (for important shipments, it is 
said) and stayed at that house when he did so. 
  His sister Bersabe, also under arrest although it is not 
known for what charges, lived across from the Plaza de Armas. 
  Another collection center may have been Humberto's ranch, 
located on the same level as the town but across the Huallaga. 
This would mean transporting the product on rafts to the little 
port of Campanilla across from the ranch. Lower down on the same 
side of the Huallaga lives another brother, Juan II (the Pope is 
also named John). According to those who know him, he is very 
poor. 
  The drug was taken from the collection centers to the 
airstrip. This meant crossing the river or walking a few blocks. 
According to one report from the Army Intelligence Service 
drafted by an agent who visited Campanilla near the end of 1991, 
the haulers or "handlers" carried it in backpacks. They would 
sit down on both sides of the streets and wait for payment or 
some scheduled flight. For their part, the chiefs moved about in 
pickup trucks guarded by armed hired killers. 
  As the time for a flight drew near, they converged on the 
airstrip to make their shipment. The twin-engine planes brought 
the money in dollars. It was unloaded and the drug loaded, some 
800 to 1,000 kilos of cocaine paste on every flight. According 
to the report and as confirmed by anyone visiting Campanilla, 
this all took place "in plain sight of Army personnel." 
  In order to convert coca leaves into paste, the laboratories 
operated in homes or on the riverbanks. When Humberto Chavez was 
arrested on 3 December, a lab operating on the bank of the 
Huallaga opposite his ranch was raided and destroyed. 
  All of this movement in town also presumed the 
complicity--and paying off--of municipal authorities. The mayor 
from 1990 to 1992 was Aprista [American Popular Revolutionary 
Alliance] member Guzman Gonzales Rivadeneyra. 
  But the facilities are different. For Vaticano, Campanilla 
was not just his center of operations. It was also the village 
where his family had come 30 years ago when it amounted to no 
more than a few huts. It is perhaps for that reason that he gave 
the mayor $500,000, the latter admits himself, "counting it out 
one bill at a time," in order to build things: the Plaza de 
Armas, the church, a satellite dish, lights for the town (only 
for the streets lining the square), and street repairs, a la 
Pablo Escobar. 
  However, the current mayor, Reinerio Cardenas Isuiza, told 
SI 
Thursday that all the works were the result of a common effort. 
During his term in office, he said, they had received help from 
Humberto Chavez only to repair streets and only in the form of 
food for the members of the Engineering Battalion: 27 kilos of 
meat a day. Like the residents of the town, the mayor recalls 
nothing at all about drug operations even though he has lived in 
Campanilla for 20 years! 
<H5>  Barriers </H5>
  In September 1992, after the first news reports appears 
concerning Vaticano's activities in Campanilla, the Army itself 
joined with the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] to install 
cement blocks on the runway. 
  However, that was not the end of the complicity. The 
bulletin 
distributed by the National Antidrug Directorate (DINANDRO) at 
the press conference at which Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera was 
presented states that "the barriers were moved at night to the 
edge of the runway so the illicit operations could take place 
(the landings, loading of cocaine paste, and takeoffs), then put 
back in place so as not to awaken suspicion." What did personnel 
at the Otorongo Base do while this was going on in front of 
their very eyes? Army Intelligence reports state that the 
soldiers even got in on the act, loading the bags of cocaine 
paste on the small planes and moving the cement blocks. 
  Only last year, as a result of the intervention of the 
Peruvian Air Force detachment stationed in Juanjui, heavier 
blocks were moved into place and barbed wire and explosives were 
installled. The flights were suspended at Campanilla, but 
continued at other strips run by Vaticano. 
<H5>  "Duck Man" </H5>
  For years, numerous military and police intelligence reports 
told of Vaticano's activities in what is known as Medio Huallaga. 
  According to sources in Huallaga, in 1990 Vaticano financed 
the construction of the landing strip in Campanilla with the aid 
of the San Martin Development Corporation (CORDESAN) and the 
Army. 
  Officials from Corde San Martin, the miniregion of Juanjui, 
and even the Huascaran Engineering Battalion 112 helped set up 
the section between kilometer markers 786 and 787 on the 
Marginal Highway in order to turn it into the Campanilla airport. 
  Peruvian Army Major Briceno headed the Huascaran Engineering 
Battalion 112 which in 1991 and 1992 had as its task the 
reconstruction of the Juanjui-Tocache section of the Marginal 
Highway. Campanilla is at the midway point. From the ground it 
is easy to see the difference in altitude between this kilometer 
and a half and the rest of the highway, which implies that in 
its reconstruction effort, the Engineering Battalion left this 
section intact. 
  Once the terrain had been "separated" for the airport, it 
had 
to be expanded on the sides and leveled for the runway. This was 
done by workers hired by the Juanjui miniregion in the CORDESAN 
jurisdiction, then headed by engineer Sergio Guerra Chombo. 
  Adolfo Isuiza, the newsman from Juanjui who was murdered in 
August 1992 by Vaticano's hired killers, filed this report in 
one of his dispatches to Radio Tropical in Tarapoto. 
  A confidential report drafted in August 1991 by CORDESAN 
confirms the irregularities. The officials involved were Renan 
Morales Azpur, head of the Juanjui-Tocache highway 
reconstruction project, Tito Perez, head of the Juanjui 
miniregion, and the latter's chief, one Rondon. 
  Both the airstrip and one section of the Marginal highway, 
specially equipped, were controlled by Vaticano for the landing 
of Colombian aircraft that took off again loaded with basic 
cocaine paste (PBC). 
  According to information received in Huallaga, Vaticano 
ended 
up operating as many as 240 flights a month. He admitted the 
spectacular figure during DINCOTE [Counterterrorism Directorate] 
interrogations. Then why did the Punta Arenas BCS not take note 
of the affair? The only possible reply: Someone looked the other 
way and more. 
  And yet, Vaticano's drug trafficking operations in the 
jungle 
did not depend solely on the flights of Colombian planes. 
  During certain periods, the combined antidrug operations of 
the FAP, PNP, and DEA observers prevented the entry into or 
departure from Campanilla. Nor is the distance from this spot 
and the Colombian border a small one. 
  However, Vaticano found a solution to the problem posed by 
his operations. 
  Reliable information gathered in Huallaga states, for 
example, that in February 1992, there were signs that Vaticano's 
clan used Army helicopters to move the cocaine paste from 
Huallaga to La Media, an important underground runway located in 
Nueva Jerusalen del Erene, Ramon Castilla-Caballococha Province, 
in Loreto. 
  This clandestine airstrip was only a few minutes from the 
border with Colombia, meaning it was much easier to get the drug 
from Peru at that point. 
  La Media was raided on 23 March 1993, resulting in the 
arrest 
of Colombian drug trafficker Manuel Guillermo Ayala Calderon, 
aka "Paisa" or "Peter," who in statements to the PNP said he had 
had drug trafficking connections with Vaticano. 
  However, what is most important is the existence of very 
precise information detailing how Vaticano could have operated 
with prominent military officials in the area. 
  There are signs that Vaticano was in Lima in February 1992. 
During his absences from Campanilla in 1992, his brother Emilio 
Chavez Penaherrera, "Gigante," ran the "business." However, the 
latter was in constant contact with Vaticano by radio in order 
to receive precise instructions, consult with him when 
necessary, or send messages to him. 
  On 24 February 1992, Gigante told Vaticano that "the duck 
man" urgently wanted to talk with him. 
  According to the information obtained and duly 
cross-checked, 
Vaticano's men used the term "ducks" to refer to Army 
helicopters flying between different spots in Huallaga. 
  Nor is that all: That day, sources in Huallaga say, Vaticano 
talked by radio with "the duck man," whose identity reportedly 
corresponds to a Peruvian Army officer, one Captain De la 
Puente, whose code name in the zone was "Javier." 
  Other reports state that this officer was reportedly a key 
in 
Vaticano's relations with other military men. 
  It is also known that precise reports exist from 1991 
pointing to signs of the use of "ducks" by Vaticano to carry the 
drug from different parts of the valley to Campanilla. 
  In 1991, coordination with the military, and specifically 
with the chief of the BCS in Punta Arenas at the time, was 
reportedly the responsibility of Elias Chavez Penaherrera or 
"Lan Chile," Vaticano's brother and lieutenant at the time. 
  Reports found in Huallaga state that Vaticano paid off 
prominent military officials in the zone, both in order to land 
small planes on the Campanilla runways as well as for the use of 
the "ducks" to carry the drug in complete safety from one place 
to another. 
  There reportedly exists an Army counterintelligence report 
stating that this Captain De la Puente supplied Vaticano 
helicopters from 1900 at night to carry cocaine paste from 
Campanilla and sometimes even to areas near the Brazilian border 
(Sion). "The duck man" may have been from the Tarapoto Military 
Base or the BCS in Punta Arenas, the reports state. 
  On 20 February of that same year, Vaticano informed the 
Colombian drug trafficker known as "Doctor" that things were 
"still going badly" since the "handling" or movement of the drug 
and payoffs to military personnel had become very expensive. 
  Other military men in the area, probably involved with 
Vaticano during those years, are EP Lieutenants "Mickey," 
"Cahuide," and "Zorro," their code names in Huallaga. 
  As one can see, a great deal remains to be investigated with 
respect to the military aspects of the Vaticano case. 
<H5>  More "Men" </H5>
  The same conversation which Vaticano had with his brother 
Gigante on 24 February 1992 can provide more clues to the 
corruption of members of law enforcement agencies in Huallaga. 
  Witnesses of the conversation in Huallaga say that Gigante 
told Vaticano that the report appearing in different media 
concerning the capture by UMOPAR [Mobile Police Unit for Rural 
Areas] and the DEA of a small plane carrying 380 kg of cocaine 
paste was not accurate. His brother informed Vaticano that the 
load seized in Pucallpa ("by the men with green eyes" and "the 
men from the red earth") was a sale of 800 kg of cocaine paste 
that they had made to the Colombian drug trafficker Mario. If 
what Gigante had told him was true, what happened to the 
remaining 420 kg? 
  Another piece of information may be related to this fact. 
  It has to do with a conversation which Vaticano had on 5 
March 1992 with a sister of his in Juanjui ("La Calena" or 
Bersabe?). 
  The sister reportedly told him that the seized drug was in 
Juanjui and that the "chief of the place" intended to get it to 
Colombia through Tarapoto. Vaticano reportedly had his sister so 
inform "Calavera" (Humberto Chavez Penaherrera) so that the 
latter, with help from the military, would try to get the 
shipment back. 
<H5>  Campanilla Defense Front </H5>
  In March 1992, Vaticano reportedly ordered, through Gigante, 
that the members of his ring in Campanilla not carry rifles, 
shotguns, or machine guns, evidence compiled in the area 
indicates. 
  However, he excepted handguns and ordered that if they had 
to 
be carried, they should be concealed in clothing. 
  The sources consulted go on to say that Vaticano stressed 
that above all, his men should not carry weapons bearing the 
Peruvian coat of arms and reportedly told Gigante that he 
coordinate with the "engineer," possibly the head of the BCS in 
Punta Arenas. 
  According to different versions given in Huallaga, weapons 
with the Peruvian coat of arms could only belong to the Army. 
  How could Vaticano's men have Army weapons? 
  The explanation given by sources interviewed state that in 
1991, Vaticano promoted the formation of the Campanilla Defense 
Front against the SL terrorists and advised the head of the 
Punta Arenas BCS to give Army weapons to the settlers, many of 
whom belonged to his ring. That year, witnesses say, Vaticano 
decided not to go on paying quotas to the Shining Path. The 
Campanilla Defense Front was one way to stand up to terrorism in 
coordination with the Army. 
  (This was roughly the time of a confrontation of Vaticano's 
band with a Shining Path column. Fifteen terrorists died in the 
battle, people in Campanilla say.) 
  Also according to accounts gathered, Vaticano reminded the 
head of the Punta Arenas BCS, through Gigante, that the 
collection of payments by small aircraft landing on the 
Campanilla strips had been temporarily suspended. 
  Gigante replied that he had already reminded the officer in 
question of that fact, but that the latter went on collecting, 
perhaps, he said, because they were soon to transfer him, the 
informants consulted in Huallaga say. 
  Why did Vaticano prohibit his men from carrying long arms, 
particularly if they bore the Peruvian coat of arms, and why did 
he insist on not collecting payoffs during the early days of 
March 1992? 
  The information available indicates that these measures were 
reportedly taken by Vaticano because of a report published on 29 
February 1992 by the daily newspaper LA REPUBLICA reporting his 
activities in Campanilla and his connections with members of the 
Army. Vaticano reportedly did not want to expose himself by 
revealing the network he had managed to set up in Huallaga for 
his illegal drug trafficking operations. 
<H5>  Police Involved </H5>
  Other sources report serious clues that might compromise PNP 
officials with Vaticano. They allegedly include Major "Che 
Gato," one Colonel Bernedo connected with the escape of the 
trafficker "Mosquito," son of "Mosca Loca" and Captain Rafael 
Lopez, cousin of the first husband of "La Calena," Abel Lopez 
Soria. The latter officer's nickname is "Muneco." 
  It has also been learned that one of the police now 
questioning La Calena is supposedly the one who stole and later 
sold to Vaticano for $5,000 the report containing everything the 
police knew about him up to the time he was captured. 
<H5>  1990: Abundant Proof </H5>
  The arrest of Colombian drug trafficker "Paisa" or "Peter" 
in 
March of 1993, who admitted making more than one "deal" with 
Vaticano, led DINANDRO to make a thorough search of its files 
and records of antidrug operations. 
  An extensive and detailed police report drafted in April 
1993 
concerning Paisa's capture in Caballococha contains the search 
and seizure on 24 July 1990, drafted by members of the PNP's 
Condor Patrol in Campanilla. The report states that the police 
entered Vaticano's house, located approximately 30 meters from 
the laboratory, which was on the right bank of the Huallaga 
River opposite Campanilla. They found the following: seven 
plastic bags, each containing 40 kilos of cocaine paste; two 
plastic bags, each containing 24 kilos of paste; one plastic bag 
containing 16 kilos of paste; two FAL [Armed Forces of 
Liberation] cartridge pouches containing 15 shells each; and an 
FAL rifle with the serial number sanded off. 
  The same report goes on to state that: "The expansion of 
investigations to obtain more evidence relating to Demetrio 
Chavez Penaherrera in illegal drug trafficking (TID) activities 
yielded information that the latter has relatives with records 
for such activities, Humberto Chavez Penaherrera (aka 
"Calavera") in particular. The trafficker was arrested at his 
house in the company of Cirilo Cardenas Mendoza and Ausberto 
Grandez, along with arms and military equipment, communications 
equipment, in a joint EP-PNP operation. The sum of $2,000 was 
paid to EP Captain "Alfaro" for the return of 04 FAL; he is a 
known trafficker in Alto Huallaga." 
  What is surprising about this report is not so much the 
content of what was found and seized, but the fact that it 
confirms the proximity of the dates. 
  If, on 24 July 1990, a police patrol managed to identify and 
then destroy Vaticano's logistical infrastructure in Campanilla, 
it is surprising that the following year, he should be promoting 
a questionable Defense Front of the People of Campanilla with 
the consent and apparent benevolence of the Army and that, 
during the early months of 1992, based solely on the information 
obtained, he should with impunity be running a vast drug 
trafficking network. 
  There are more than enough reasons for a thorough 
investigation of the possible relations of this drug trafficker 
with prominent military and Police officials in the zone. To 
fail to do so will weaken even further the precarious image 
which our country has abroad in terms of its fight against drug 
trafficking.

  [Text] President Alberto Fujimori is the favorite 
candidate for the 1995 elections according to a poll conducted 
by the Datum enterprise. 
  The poll reveals that between Fujimori and Javier Perez de 
Cuellar, 35 percent prefer Fujimori and 30 percent Perez de 
Cuellar. 
  The survey also reveals something new: If Fujimori competed 
against an unidentified candidate of the opposition, the latter 
would obtain 36 percent of the votes and Fujimori 39 percent. 
  Even like this, Fujimori would still be 11 points below the 
figure required to, hypothetically, win the first round of 
elections and thus eliminate a second round. 
  The results of the poll, which included a universe of 400 
people of different social levels in Lima and Callao between 26 
February and 1 March, were disclosed yesterday during the 
television program "Contrapunto."

<F P=106> [Article by Cesar Teran Vega] </F>
  [Text] Tingo Maria, 5 Mar -- Another 100 subversives from 
the various localities of Leoncio Prado Province arrived here 
this morning to avail themselves of the Repentance Law. Their 
presence confirms the firm determination of the people of Upper 
Huallaga (Tingo Maria-Tocache) to find reconciliation, peace, 
and development. 
  The repented subversives, some with their respective 
families, were welcomed by the commanders, officers, and 
soldiers of Antisubversive Battalion No. 313, which is 
headquartered in "Los Laureles" Fort, on the outskirts of this 
city. 
  In increasingly frequent and massive numbers, waves of 
townspeople are coming here to choose the path of pacification, 
after having mistakenly joined the Shining Path, or after being 
forced, or even abducted, to cooperate with this criminal 
terrorist organization. 
  They explained to LA REPUBLICA today that before taking this 
step, most of them had previously contacted peasant self-defense 
patrol members of their respective localities. 
  That is why military authorities attach priority to the 
organization of the self-defense patrols and the self-defense 
committees in the towns of Upper Huallaga. 
  Some repented subversives try to make contact with military 
authorities in the Emergency Zone, in the antisubversive 
barracks of Tingo Maria and Tocache. Relatives, friends, or 
some other spokesman mediate on their behalf, seeking guarantees 
in exchange for their surrender. 
  Today we saw the new group of repentant people being 
properly 
registered at "Los Laureles" Fort. They will then be submitted 
to a thorough medical checkup, including women and children. 
  All pregnant women, and mothers and babies are transferred 
to 
a Health Ministry hospital for specialized care. 
  The people will remain at "Los Laureles" Fort as long as 
necessary to be monitored, to receive medical treatment, to 
obtain the necessary documents to legalize their status as free 
citizens who are not wanted by the courts and -- in some cases 
-- to receive military protection as refugees. 
  Most of the ones from this central jungle area decide to 
return almost immediately to their towns, back to their farm 
work and to the self-defense committees that now fight the 
Shining Path cells, which are desperately and unsuccessfully 
trying to reorganize. 
  Today's arrival of the 100 repented subversives coincided 
with the conclusion of a military training cycle of 30 peasant 
self-defense patrol members from various peasant communities. 
  Some of these patrol members are former subversives who 
repented and authorities of their respective localities who have 
been courageous enough to accept the challenge, refusing to 
yield to terrorist extortion and threats. 
  These authorities have actively organized self-defense 
committees and peasant patrols to preserve order in the towns. 
They comprise volunteers of a community who are supplied with 
shotguns and machetes, and who are trained by the military. 
They protect civilians. 
  A self-defense committee, which includes the peasant patrol, 
has a much broader mission. It protects the community and, at 
the same time, participates in reconstruction work, in the 
construction of civil works for the community, and in social 
support programs to promote development. 
  EP [Peruvian Army] Commander Javier Riva Ramirez is the 
political-military commander of Leoncio Prado (Tingo Maria) 
Province and chief of Antisubversive Battalion No. 313 
headquartered in "Los Laureles." Today, he supervised the 
incorporation of 100 peasant patrol members and the peasant 
patrol members' training session. 
  Commander Riva reported that nine peasant patrols have so 
far 
been organized and trained in Leoncio Prado Province, the 
capital of which is Tingo Maria. 
  Some 900 duly trained men, whom the government has supplied 
with shotguns, are members of those patrols. 
  "To avoid infiltration by subversives, each peasant patrol 
candidate is submitted to examinations and careful evaluations 
that begin in their own community," Commander Riva said. 
  He described the following steps of the evaluation and 
selection: 

  -  Peasant patrol candidates are first studied and selected 
by the authorities and by the people of each community. The 
names are then proposed before the military authorities of the 
Huallaga Front. 
  -  The applicants then report to the respective 
military barracks where a team of psychologists, psychiatrists, 
lawyers, and other specialists will study their personalities, 
backgrounds, and physical and mental capacity. 
  -  One these exams 
are passed, applicants are ready to receive military 
training. 
  -  Instructors teach patrol members defensive tactics in 
order to efficiently patrol their towns, the theory of the 
operation of firearms, practice with shotguns, and courage tests 
in a combat range and in the field. 
  Under a burning sun, and in extremely muddy conditions 
following recent torrential rains, LA REPUBLICA today watched a 
military training session of 30 peasant patrol members. 
  It was the last session of their training; at 1100 they 
attended a special ceremony at "Los Laureles" fort. 
  At that civic patriotic ceremony, hundreds of peasant 
patrol members and a large number of repented subversives swore 
allegiance to the Peruvian flag. They also swore to fight 
terrorism and subversion so as to consolidate regional and 
national peace. 
  At the shotgun exercises, the applicants today obtained 
satisfactory grades. The instructors said that some are quite 
good. 
  Instructors are especially interested in teaching patrol 
members a defensive, rather than offensive, spirit. 
  An instructors told them: "Bear in mind that your mission 
is, above all, to guarantee peace and order in your communities. 
We are fed up with war and useless shedding of blood. 
Consequently, be very careful when using the arms that we are 
giving you today." 
  He added: "Do not forget that arms can help to protect many 
lives. They must be used only when necessary and against 
terrorist criminals who threaten our towns and our families." 
  When the patrol members fired their arms, the instructors 
especially emphasized precautions for the use of shotguns to 
avoid endangering innocent lives. 
  Commander Javier Riva told LA REPUBLICA that the new 
pacification strategy in Upper Huallaga involves the creation of 
the largest number of self-defense committees and the largest 
number of repented subversives. 
  Commander Riva said: "This is linked with a broad program of 
social support for people rescued from the Shining Path yoke." 
  He announced that soon his office will -- in coordination 
with the commander of the Huallaga Front, General Alfredo 
Rodriguez -- implement far-reaching agreements with the Special 
Upper Huallaga Project and with Foncodes [National Compensation 
and Social Development Fund], to find jobs and help the repented 
subversives, who are now striving to rejoin society.

<F P=106> [Article by Liz Mineo] </F>
  [Text] Before his arrest Demetrio Limonier Chavez 
Penaherrera, also known as "Vaticano," was the head of the 
largest drug-trafficking mafia in Peru, administering like no 
other drug trafficker huge amounts of drugs and dollars. It is 
estimated that he alone sold an average of 60 tonnes of cocaine 
base per year, valued at $900 million. 
  "Vaticano" was the main cocaine base dealer in Peru for the 
Cali cartel, as well as its safest trafficker, as he could 
guarantee the cocaine base shipments to Colombia in small hired 
airplanes that took off from the clandestine landing strips he 
controlled. 
  During its golden times between 1989 and 1992, the Chavez 
Penaherrera empire, whose headquarters were located in 
Campanilla, extended to Uchiza in the south and Saposoa in the 
north. 
  Although his organization became the most powerful one in 
Peru, his gang never attained the nearly absolute power and 
sophisticated structure of the Colombian drug cartels. 
"Vaticano's" organization was, in some aspects, even a step 
behind some of his Peruvian counterparts. 
  His arrest, which took place in Cali in mid-January, ended 
the belief that Chavez Penaherrera would found the first 
Peruvian drug cartel. This possibility has yet not been ruled 
out, as there are several drug mafias in the country that are 
reportedly in better condition to do what he could not. 
  Meanwhile, the police think that one of the Chavez 
Penaherrera brothers, Elias, also known as "Lan Chile," has 
taken over control of the "firm." 
<H5>  "El Ministro" </H5>
  Waldo Vargas Arias, a Colombian drug trafficker whose alias 
is "El Ministro," heads the second most important 
drug-trafficking "firm" in Peru, and ought to be the main 
candidate for replacing "Vaticano." 
  It is said that Vargas Arias sends more than 40 tonnes of 
cocaine base per year to the Colombian drug "kingpins" with whom 
he deals directly. "El Ministro," however, is far from being 
just a cocaine base dealer, as he manages a network of 
clandestine laboratories. He processes cocaine hydrochloride and 
manages a large network of contacts with Peruvian drug 
traffickers. 
  Without a doubt, the most profitable activity he has is 
processing and exporting cocaine hydrochloride. More than half 
the national production of cocaine comes from "El Ministro's" 
laboratories. It is estimated that in 1993 nearly 70 tonnes of 
cocaine hydrochloride were produced in the country. 
  Although Waldo Vargas Arias has surpassed "Vaticano" in 
several aspects, it seems that he really does not wish to be on 
top of the rest of the drug kingpins. 
  "`El Ministro' prefers to remain in the jungle managing his 
businesses. It seems that he is not interested in power, given 
that his lifestyle is neither flamboyant nor exaggerated like 
that of `Vaticano,'" a police source said. 
  Vargas Arias' operations center is located in the Lower 
Huallaga region, although he has recently expanded outside San 
Martin Department, near the town of Lagunas, near Yurimaguas. 
<H5>  The Cachique Rivera Brothers </H5>
  According to the police, the Cachique Rivera brothers' gang 
is the surest candidate for becoming the first Peruvian drug 
cartel, given its broad network over nearly the entire national 
territory and the different activities in which it participates. 
  These enterprising brothers are not only cocaine base 
middlemen, but have extended their activities to all the 
possible drug trafficking components. 
  They administer a network of laboratories, manufacture 
cocaine hydrochloride, are engaged in precursor traffic, control 
several clandestine landing strips, and have their own fleet of 
small airplanes. 
  They have the largest network of contacts with Peruvian 
drug traffickers, maintain direct contact with the chiefs of the 
Cali cartel, and have some connections in Europe. As if that 
were not enough, they have their own drug money "laundering" 
system. 
  The Cachique Rivera brothers operate in several zones 
throughout the national territory. They operate in Cajamarca, 
Chiclayo, and Trujillo in the north; in Aguaytia and Pucallpa in 
the east; in Lima and Ica in the center; in Sierra Pasco, 
Palmapampa, Apurimac, and Pichis-Palcazu Valley in the 
mountains; and in Manu in the south. Their operations center is 
located in Aguaytia, a town in Ucayali Department. 
  Their gang is made up of four brothers from Tingo Maria. 
Their names are Adolfo, also known as "Alferez"; Abelardo, also 
known as "Teniente"; Segundo, also known as "Capitan"; and 
Nicolas, also known as "Mayor." It is known that Abelardo lives 
in Cali and is regarded as the fiercest of the four. According 
to the police he conducts their "firm's" operations from 
Colombia, while Segundo surveys the normal operation of the 
"business" in the jungle area. 
  The power of the Cachique Rivera brothers can hardly be 
matched by the other mafias that operate in the country. It is 
estimated that they send nearly 15 tonnes of cocaine 
hydrochloride per year to the Cali cartel, which makes them 
their main supplier. 
  Together with "El Ministro,"the Cachique Rivera brothers are 
the main producers and exporters of cocaine hydrochloride in 
Peru. 
<H5>  The Group of Six </H5>
  According to Dinandro [Antidrug Division] and DEA files, a 
special group is made up of six lesser known "firms" which are 
nonetheless just as important given the amount of drugs and 
dollars they move. 
  These "firms" are headed by Jorge Alvarez Enriquez, also 
known as "Chino Jorge"; Braulio Tafur Alvarado, also known as 
"Tio Braulio"; Juan Leguia Manzur, also known as "Nino"; Luis 
Perez, also known as "Luco Culon"; Carlos Melendez Andrade; and 
Willer Alvarado Linares. 
  All of them are cocaine base dealers. They collect cocaine 
base and sell it to the Colombian drug traffickers, with whom 
they deal only through middlemen. Their areas of operation are 
located in many settlements in the Huallaga region. 
  Alvarez, Tafur, Perez, and Alvarado operated in Saposoa, 
Juanjui, Uchiza, and in the Lower Huallaga. Leguia and 
Melendez operated in Palmapampa and Manu, which has become a new 
drug trafficking operations center. 
  From this group, the most important traffickers are Leguia, 
Manzur, and Melendez Andrade. They have their own small 
airplanes and access to clandestine landing strips which 
guarantee the transportation of drugs. Among all of them, 
Melendez seems to have more advantages than the others, as he 
controls some laboratories in which he manufactures washed coca 
paste and cocaine hydrochloride. 
  It is estimated that all these firms send nearly 15 tonnes 
of 
drugs per year to Colombia. 
<H5>  The Rest </H5>
  Other less important gangs that also deal in large amounts 
of 
drugs are made up of families that operate in different parts of 
the country. 
  According to the police, the brothers Luis and Jorge 
Cardenas 
Guzman, also known as the "Mosquitos" -- sons of the well-known 
drug trafficker "Mosca Loca" -- operate in Bellavista and 
Iquitos. The brothers Luis and Javier Lopez, also known as 
"Crespo I" and "Crespo II," operate in Saposoa and Campanilla. 
  Eliseo Alvarado Perez, also known as "Champa," father of 
Willer Alvarado Linares, is known as one of the "bosses" of 
Aucayacu, and the Julca Urrello brothers -- one of whose members 
was arrested together with "Vaticano" in Cali -- operate in Ica. 
  There are many other traffickers who are known only by their 
aliases: "Cristo," "Tolima," "Azul," "Tio Poderoso," "Bigote," 
"Charapa," "Pelo Duro," "Galleta," and "Clavo." These are just 
some of the aliases registered by the police in its files, which 
grow every day with the names of criminals who aspire to one day 
follow after "Vaticano," who is currently in prison.

  [Text] The Rio Group, which is an association of Latin 
American countries, today concludes a preparatory meeting for 
the Rio Group presidential summit next September. The group is 
mainly discussing the social-economic development in the region, 
as explained by Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim. 
  [Begin Amorim recording] The subjects are democracy, human 
rights, sustained development, and science and technology. This 
meeting obviously cannot exhaust all subjects, because it is 
merely the preparation for a process that will conclude with a 
presidential summit in September. Beside economic and social 
development, as well as poverty -- which are essential subjects 
-- I believe we will also discuss the possibility of a consensus 
on the hemispheric conference. [end recording] 
  The election of the next OAS secretary general is another 
subject to be discussed in this Rio Group meeting.

  [Text] Brasilia, 22 Mar (EFE) -- Diplomatic source told EFE 
News Agency that some Rio Group foreign ministers -- who have 
been holding talks in Brasilia for the last two days -- 
expressed certain reservations about the U.S. proposal that 
Miami should host the next summit of the Americas convened by 
the United States. 
  Although the heads of Latin American diplomacy were 
enthusiastic about U.S. President Bill Clinton's proposal, some 
of them expounded the "inadvisability" of holding the summit in 
Miami, where anti-Castro groups have a lot of clout. 
  The diplomats who assisted at the Brasilia meeting, which 
ended today, told EFE that the issue was discussed at the 
meeting, but did not disclose what delegations were opposed to 
Miami being the venue for the summit meeting. 
  The reservations stem from the fear that anti-Castro groups 
will harass some heads of state on account of the independent 
stance adopted by their countries and the Rio Group concerning 
the U.S. policy vis-a-vis Cuba. 
  The reservations seemingly reached the ears of U.S. Vice 
President Albert Gore, who made a seven-hour visit to Brasilia 
-- which extended from the evening of 21 March to the early 
hours of 22 March -- to invite Brazilian President Itamar Franco 
to the Miami summit. 
  After the Rio Group meeting, Brazilian Foreign Minister 
Celso 
Amorim said Gore guaranteed him that matters alien to the summit 
-- alluding to anti-Castro Cubans -- will not interfere in its 
organization and agenda. 
  Amorim noted that it is "too early" to say whether Cuba's 
political and economic situation will be included on the 
December summit's agenda. 
  He further stated that both the summit's date and venue 
depend on the decision of the U.S. Government, which convened 
the meeting. 
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli commented 
that, in his view, Miami was not a "risky" place to bring 
together all the heads of state in the Americas. 
  Several Rio Group foreign ministers praised the flexibility 
of the issues proposed by Clinton, who has asked governments to 
offer suggestions to complete the agenda. 
  The subjects put forward by Clinton to his Western 
Hemisphere 
counterparts include the strengthening of democracy, human 
rights, trade, poverty, the environment, and the streamlining of 
public administration. 
  Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner told 
EFE that his country is interested in highlighting trade 
liberalization, economic investments, and cooperation at the 
summit. Burelli, for his part, noted that questions like 
education, poverty, and access to technology had to be part of 
the agenda. 
  Despite the fact that they differ widely on the types of 
pressure that should be exerted on Cuba so it will adopt a 
pluralistic system to replace the single-party system, Rio Group 
countries have condemned the trade embargo on Cuba imposed by 
the United States more than 30 years ago. 
  Brazil and Colombia recently have become the target of 
criticism and threats by anti-Castro groups due to their stances 
on the situation in Havana.

  [Text] Brasilia, 22 Mar (EFE) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister 
Celso Amorim stated today that his country endorses a consensus 
candidate for the election of the OAS secretary general to be 
held in Washington on 27 March. 
  Amorim said that neither formal nor informal consultations 
were made on the OAS vote during the two-day meeting of the 13 
Rio Group foreign ministers that ended today. 
  Brazil has promised to vote for Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria, contending that he would bring prestige to the OAS 
because of his successful record as president of his country for 
the four-year term that will end on 7 August. 
  The foreign ministers and other government officials who 
represented their countries at the Brasilia meeting, which 
focused on the search for formulas to eradicate poverty and 
unemployment and on reconciling positions for the continental 
summit scheduled for December in Miami, sounded their 
preferences for the 27 March vote. 
  Ambassadors from the 35 OAS member countries will elect the 
candidate to replace former Brazilian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Joao Baena Soares, who has served as OAS secretary general for 
two consecutive five-year terms since 1984. 
  In addition to Gaviria, the other two candidates are Costa 
Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus and Venezuelan Foreign 
Minister Miguel Angel Burelli. 
  Five positions have been identified within the Rio Group, 
the 
main forum for joint political and economic actions in Latin 
America. They are the positions of the three groups supporting 
each of the three candidates, the one advocating a formula for a 
consensus candidate, and Ecuador's undecided position. 
  Seven Rio Group member countries -- Mexico, Argentina, 
Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Colombia, and Peru -- support 
Gaviria; Chile, Guatemala, and Trinidad-Tobago support Niehaus; 
and Venezuela supports its foreign minister, Burelli. 
  Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu today reaffirmed to 
EFE his 21 March proposal of seeking a consensus candidate, who 
could be any of the three candidates or someone else. 
  The initiative to seek a consensus candidate, Abreu said, 
"may appear to be vague, but it is a responsible one" in light 
of the atmosphere of confrontation between the candidacies of 
Gaviria and Niehaus. Abreu did not give further details of his 
proposal. 
  Abreu added: "An OAS election cannot be held in an 
atmosphere 
of confrontation. If we let matters take their course, we would 
be starting a new term of the secretary general with divisions 
already among its members."

  [Text] Brasilia, 22 Mar (EFE) -- The foreign ministers and 
representatives of the 13 member countries that make up the Rio 
Group today concluded a 48-hour meeting in which they evaluated, 
among other matters, the continental summit that has been 
convoked by the United States and which will be held in Miami in 
December. 
  The meeting of the representatives of Latin American 
diplomacy coincided with the fleeting 7-hour visit by U.S. 
President Albert Gore to Brasilia to invite Brazilian President 
Itamar Franco to the Miami meeting. 
  Gore took advantage of his meeting with Franco and Foreign 
Minister Celso Amorim to greet the foreign ministers and 
representatives of the 13 countries, which agreed to harmonize 
their position regarding the U.S. initiative. 
  The Rio Group foreign ministers will discuss on 24 April in 
Sao Paulo, the seat of the Latin American Parliament 
(Parlatino), all matters they want discussed at the Miami 
summit, including what some diplomats have termed "the Latin 
American perception" of the meeting. 
  An agenda was approved that will be proposed to the foreign 
ministers of the European Union for the 6-monthly joint meeting 
to be held between 20 and 23 April at the seat of the Parlatino. 
  The member countries of the Rio group are: Mexico, Colombia, 
Panama, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, 
Uruguay, Chile, Guatemala, and Trinidad and Tobago.

  [Text] The Rio Group today discussed in Brasilia the need 
to ensure the developing countries' access to high technology 
and the right to transfer it. 
  The 13 Rio Group foreign ministers will meet in Sao Paulo on 
22 and 23 April with a group of European Union foreign 
ministers. The meeting's objective will be to discuss proposals 
presented in the first Rio Group meeting this year, which ended 
today in Brasilia. 
  In the meeting, the foreign ministers discussed topics such 
as the fight against poverty, human rights, sustainable 
development, and science and technology exchange. 
  According to Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, the meeting 
helped the Rio Group member countries prepare for the 
presidential and chiefs of state meeting to be held in September. 
  The foreign ministers also analyzed the letter received from 
U.S. President Bill Clinton asking for a hemispheric conference 
to discuss poverty and misery in the American continent. 
  Minister Amorim also said the Rio Group member countries are 
concerned about the situation in Suriname, where armed groups 
conducted attacks a few days ago.

reports on Costa Rican economic developments monitored through 
22 March 1994. 
  Finance Ministry authorities have reported that at the end 
of 
January, the country's gross foreign exchange reserves were

  [Text] Terrorist Oscar Alberto Ramirez Durand, alias 
Feliciano, who is considered to be the new Shining Path chief, 
limps on his right leg and is totally bald. Police intelligence 
sources believe he uses a toupee or wig. 
  The intelligence services indicate that Feliciano, the son 
of 
a well-known retired Army general, is the most influential 
leader in the collective national Shining Path leadership, the 
main unit of that organization since the capture of its founder 
Abimael Guzman Reinoso. 
  Various departments of the National Intelligence System 
(SIN) 
have, until now, been unable to obtain any new information on 
the whereabouts and the physical appearance of the terrorist. 
  Latest reports suggest that he is in the southern part of 
the 
country, but this is unconfirmed. There is also evidence that 
his hideout is in metropolitan Lima. 
  The PNP [National Peruvian Police] and the SIN only have two 
photographs of Feliciano: One is 12 years old, and the other 
dates back to 1988. This second photograph was taken from a 
video tape confiscated at the house in San Borja where it is 
believed Guzman took refuge. 
  The photograph is blurred and his physical aspects are not 
shown clearly. Ramirez uses glasses in both photographs. He 
wears glasses and is in a stage of advanced baldness. 
  The only new aspect to now is information regarding the limp 
and the toupee, according to details obtained from Shining Path 
members captured during the past few months. 
  No one close to Ramirez has yet been captured who could help 
draw an identifiable picture of his physical appearance. 
  It is not exactly known how he obtained the limp, but it is 
known that it was acquired some years ago. 
  One police officer commented that it is possible he is now 
completely bald and that he uses a toupee. "It is not 
inconceivable for him to be walking about Lima with a false 
identity and new physical features," the source added. 
  Analysts suggest Feliciano leads the hard line -- Pol Pot 
style -- sector of the terrorist group because his position is 
opposite to that of Guzman and of the main "historical leaders" 
of Shining Path. The hard line sector has been attributed with 
the most recent attacks.

<H5>  Military Party </H5>
  Two weeks ago, Army Commander General [title as published] 
Nicolas de Bari Hermoza gathered a large number of Lima garrison 
officers at the Military School hall and made an aggressive 
speech against those who allegedly are conducting a campaign to 
discredit the Army. Beating on a table with his fists, Hermoza 
stressed that he would not allow the trial of his officers by 
courts of law. Afterward, he repeated the details of Army Press 
Office (OIE) Press Bulletin 02-94, dated 10 February. This 
bulletin states: "The political programs broadcast by the 
television channels and published by the magazines SI, OIGA, and 
CARETAS, and especially the newspaper LA REPUBLICA are 
disseminating biased reports with a clear intention of feigning 
(...) an Army relationship and complicity with drug trafficking." 
  At first sight, the first misinterpretation is that the OIE 
and Hermoza claim that the reports on the links between some 
military officers and drug trafficking are aimed against the 
entire Army. Thus, the military leaders attempt to protect 
themselves behind the Army and resort to solidarity, instead of 
responding to the very solid charges actually raised by Army 
members. 
  The threat to the independent press has been rejected by the 
media and the Journalists Association. In a strong communique 
signed by its dean, Miguel Calderon, the Journalists Association 
pointed out the press' supervisory role and asked President 
Alberto Fujimori to deny the report and punish those who are 
circulating it. 
  As an odd feature, it is worth pointing out that the 
aforementioned nine-page communique -- of an entirely political 
content -- concludes with a warning remark: "The current BIE 
[Army Press Bulletin] will be read and discussed with all Army 
military personnel."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Peru monitored through 17 
March. 
  Education Vice Minister Esther Gago Hurtado and PRC 
Ambassador to Peru Chen Jiuchang on 5 March signed an agreement 
to promote a broad program of cultural exchange and strengthen 
links between the two countries. The program will be implemented 
through 1996. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 6 Mar 94 p 16) 
  The Japanese Government has agreed to lend Peru, together 
with the Inter-American Development Bank, IDB, $21 million to 
help improve health services. The agreement was signed on 16 
March by Prime and Foreign Minister Efrain Goldenberg and 
Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister (Shoko Atuma). Goldenberg said 
he hopes the loan will benefit at least 5 million Peruvians. 
(Lima Global de Television Network in Spanish 0100 GMT 16 Mar 94) 
  Net profits for the Central Peru Mining Enterprise, 
Centromin, was $15 million in 1993. Sales domestically and 
abroad totaled $389 million. Although production increased $97.5 
million in 1993, sales dropped 3 percent compared with 1992 
because of a decline in international prices for the main 
minerals produced by Centromin. (Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish 9

  On 9 March, the Chilean and Peruvian agriculture ministers 
signed an economic, technical, and scientific cooperation

<H6>  Poll Shows Approval Dip Linked to La Cantuta Law </H6>
  A February poll shows a drop in approval ratings for 
President Fujimori, Constituent Congress President Jaime 
Yoshiyama, then-Prime Minister Alfonso Bustamante, the Peruvian 
Government, and the Constituent Democratic Congress. The 
February figures represent a drop in approval ranging from 10 
percent (government, Yoshiyama), 8 percent (Fujimori), 7 percent 
(Congress), to a slight 3 percent (Bustamante) since January. 
  The poll was taken following the Congress' passage of a law 
to move the La Cantuta case from a civil to a military court. 
The poll was published by the Apoyo-owned weekly SEMANA 
ECONOMICA and was conducted with Lima residents. The number of 
interviewees, their socioeconomic category, sex and age, as well 
as the margin of error were not given. 
  A full 72 percent of the respondents said they believed the 
La Cantuta law had been passed under pressure from the military, 
with 68 percent saying the law violated the autonomy of the 
judiciary, and 64 percent disapproving of the law. 
  While the leading actors in the decision to send the La 
Cantuta case to a military court experienced a drop in approval, 
the government's counterterrorism and economic policies 
maintained about the same levels of approval (71 for 
counterterrorism, 42 for economic measures) as in January. 
  The unspecified political opposition, as well as Lima Mayor 
Ricardo Belmont in particular, enjoyed some gains (6 and 3 
percent, respectively).

  [Text] San Salvador, 22 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Riot police this 
morning stormed a polling center that had been occupied by the 
opposition in Jucuapa Municipality in the eastern department of 
Usulutan. Opposition groups have accused the National 
Republican Alliance (Arena) government of committing fraud in 
Sunday's general elections. 
  Members and supporters of the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front (FMLN), the Unity Movement, the National 
Conciliation Party (PCN), and Christian Democratic Party (PDC) 
yesterday occupied a school facility where ballot boxes were 
being stored. 
  FMLN member Ricardo Samayoa said riot police broke down the 
main entrance of the school while residents of Jucuapa, in the 
northern part of Usulutan, surrounded the building to prevent 
police from taking the ballot boxes to San Salvador. Samayoa 
added that no one was injured or beaten in the incident. He 
said members of the right-wing Arena party marked hundreds of 
ballots before voting began two days ago in nationwide general 
elections to elect a new president, mayors, and deputies. 
  "All of the political parties were able to confirm this. We 
found several Arena members with several marked ballots before 
the voting process began," he said. 
  The ballot boxes were being guarded by representatives of 
opposition political parties demanding that the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal [TSE] annul the elections in this 
municipality in the eastern part of the country. They warned 
that if the TSE does not annul the elections in Jucuapa, those 
parties that took part in the elections in this region will 
elect a municipal government by consensus. The TSE has not 
issued a statement on this incident, which is unprecedented. 
  So far, the ruling Arena party has garnered 49.18 percent of 
the votes counted up until Monday afternoon to elect the 
president and vice president. The leftist coalition comprising 
the FMLN former guerrilla organization, Democratic Convergence 
(CD), and the National Revolutionary Movement (MNR) has obtained 
25.66 percent of the votes, while the PDC has obtained 15.94 
percent. The TSE has announced the possibility of a 24 April 
runoff in which the Arena and leftist coalition candidates will 
compete for the presidency.

  [Text] We have a last-minute report. Jucuapa riot police 
stormed the entrance of the Saul Flores School where the ballot 
boxes are located, according to members of the FMLN [Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front]. Ricardo Samayoa, of the FMLN 
Political Committee, said the people began to gather in front of 
the school building and added that there have not been any major 
incidents. 
  [Begin recording] [Samayoa] Riot police and members of the 
civilian National Police, whose actions are being repudiated by 
the residents of Jucuapa, broke into the school building where 
the election ballots were being held. This incident is evidence 
of the fraud that Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance] has 
tried to stage in this town as well as in the rest of the 
country. The residents of Jucuapa are opposed to this. There 
have been clashes with members of the civilian National Police. 
We call on the international community to take note of the 
incident that is occurring at this time in the town of Jucuapa. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The ballot boxes have still not been 
taken to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE]? 
  [Samayoa] The ballot boxes are inside the building, but the 
entrance has been damaged. The locks have been destroyed and 
the door was damaged in an attempt to take out the ballot boxes. 
The people, however, have gathered there to prevent them from 
doing so and to observe what the riot police are doing. [end 
recording] 
  The police authorities have still not made a statement on 
the 
case. The TSE and the UN Observers for El Salvador had already 
challenged these votes.

  [Text] After counting 73 percent of the total valid votes 
cast on Sunday, Luis Arturo Zaldivar, Supreme Electoral Tribunal 
[TSE] president, announced that a runoff election to choose the 
president of the Republic will be necessary. 
  "None of the parties with the possibility of winning have 
attained the percentage demanded by law to secure victory. 
Therefore, all tendencies lead to the possibility of a runoff 
election. The TSE already has a budget earmarked for this, and 
as of this very moment we are making preparations for the 
event," the official added. 
  With regard to the problems or shortcomings charged by some 
of the political parties, he said that these can be overcome in 
the new election and that the TSE is willing to correct the 
errors that could have been committed at voting time. 
Nevertheless, he emphasized that the noted problems do not have 
serious repercussions on the final results of the election and 
that these are normal in any activity of this nature. 
  With 73 percent of the votes counted, Armando Calderon Sol 
garnered 49 percent; Ruben Zamora of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front]-Convergence-MNR [National 
Revolutionary Movement] coalition received 26 percent; and Fidel 
Chavez of the PDC [Christian Democratic Party] received 14 
percent. 
  "The preliminary results clearly indicate that the tendency 
is in favor of Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance]. It has 
been made clear that we continue being the choice of the 
Salvadoran people," said Calderon Sol. 
  To win in the first round for the Presidency, 50 percent 
plus 
one vote is required. Whoever is elected will replace President 
Alfredo Cristiani on 1 June for a five-year period.

<F P=106> [News conference by Joaquin Villalobos, leader of the </F>
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, with unidentified 
reporters on 22 March at the Presidente Hotel in San Salvador -- 
live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Villalobos] As time goes by we are receiving 
detailed reports -- 48 hours after the elections -- on how the 
elections were conducted. These reports led us to conclusions 
beyond those that we reached on 20 March as the results were 
released. We had an informal agreement that as preliminary 
results were being released we could analyze the elections. Our 
plan was to make an assessment before the results were released. 
In our assessment, we reported that some citizens were unable 
to vote. No one can estimate the number of people who could not 
vote. We have an indication, though. For instance, we have a 
list of people who approached an ONG [expansion unknown] and 
were unable to vote despite having their voter registration 
cards. The list was prepared over a few hours and describes 
incidents at a polling station in La Union Department. This list 
includes about 200 people who had their voter registration cards 
but could not vote. The exclusion of voters is the first 
anomaly we reported in the elections. 
  As time goes by, we are receiving other reports. For 
example, a critical case involves the Jucuapa Municipality, 
Usulutan Department. Two Arena [Nationalist Republican 
Alliance] members, whose names I know, were caught red-handed. 
One of them had poll watcher credentials, and the other was a 
member of a voting table board. They were caught with a large 
number of Arena ballots that were in the box. This incident 
prompted... [pauses] in the Jucuapa case, there are ballot boxes 
that had more votes than the number of votes that each box was 
supposed to have, that is, there are boxes that had more than 
400 votes. This also happened in other communities. 
  The Jucuapa incident prompted the raid on the town's mayoral 
office at a time when all ballot boxes inside. [sentence as 
heard] Members of all opposing parties, including the CD 
[Democratic Convergence], the National Solidarity Movement, the 
Unity Movement, the Christian Democratic Party, and the FMLN, 
staged a protest together, because we were worried that the 
ballot boxes could be taken away and tampered with. 
  There are also a large number of reports on minors who had 
voter registration cards. There are also reports on people who 
came to vote and realized that someone else had voted for them. 
We are receiving a number of votes... [pauses] in other 
communities, we found ballots marked on the front that were 
supposedly lost. We found them and are using them as proof. 
  The most serious report consists of Arena ballots already 
marked that were placed in the boxes. The other serious report 
consists of FMLN ballots that were lost. Everything indicates 
that more ballots were printed than were needed. There was a 
plan to print ballots twice. However, at the moment we cannot 
determine how large this operation was. We know that the 
ballots were printed by the Laser Printing Company, whose owner 
is General Alejandro Vides Casanova, former defense minister and 
former National Guard chief. We must emphasize that we reported 
this earlier. We opposed printing the ballots there. Our 
position called for the ballots to be printed abroad. 
  [Reporter] What are you denouncing? 
  [Villalobos] We are denouncing a fraud whose extent we have 
not yet been able to determine. This afternoon, we filed 
protests to contest results in various places. In the 
department of... [pauses] in San Miguel Municipality, Mr. Garcia 
Prieto took 15 ballot boxes home with him. We are contesting 
those 15 ballot boxes. 
  [Reporter] Where are those boxes from? 
  [Villalobos] From San Miguel Municipality, from the city of 
San Miguel. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] number of anomalies, in other 
words... 
  [Villalobos, interrupting] We are proceeding through legal 
means. This afternoon we filed protests in various places. The 
problem is that this kind of fraud, depending on how extensive 
it truly is -- and granted, it is true that it may not affect 
the final outcome of the presidential election, and we cannot 
determine this anyway -- nevertheless, it did indeed affect 
mayoral and deputy elections, because these elections can be 
decided by 10 votes, six votes, 20 votes, or 50 votes. This is 
a very complex situation. 
  More important is that we are extremely worried because 
Arena 
has claimed to have won 42 deputy seats. This claim conflicts 
with our vote count. According to our count, Arena has won 37 
deputy seats so far, while the FMLN has won 23 deputy seats. 
  It worries us that on the very night of the elections the 
PCN 
[National Conciliation Party] claimed to have won up to 14 
deputy seats. At this time, we think all of these anomalies are 
designed to establish a majority between the PCN and Arena in 
the Legislative Assembly. This would constitute very serious 
and substantial fraud.

<F P=106> [Report by Flavio Figueiredo from the Finance Ministry] </F>
  [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso today 
said that the Constitution clearly states that no public 
employee can have a higher salary than the president of the 
Republic's. The minister admitted that public employees' 
salaries are low. He added, however, that at the current moment 
-- when everyone's capacity to sacrifice is being tested -- it 
is not acceptable that cuts be implemented in the salaries of 
some and not in the salaries of others. The finance minister 
said that if the problem in converting salaries into Real Value 
Units results from the wording of the provisional measure, he 
will ask President Itamar Franco to write another text. 
  Minister Cardoso today held a meeting with businessmen at 
the 
National Confederation of Industries headquarters and tried to 
calm down the financial market. He denied today the rumor that 
30 April will be a bank holiday. According to him, it will not 
be a holiday because the government does not want to touch 
savings passbooks or freeze prices: 
  [Begin recording] There will be no bank holiday on 30 April 
or any other day because we will not touch the savings passbooks 
or, by no means, impose price controls. We will force prices 
down, control abuse, but will not control prices or anything 
else that might affect the people's pockets. There will be no 
bank holiday; this is a thing of the past and it is over. [end 
recording] 
  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso today received the 
businessmen's support for the economic stabilization plan. They 
asked the minister, however, to do his best in favor of the 
constitutional reform because they deem it fundamental for the 
plan's success. 
  Some entrepreneurs also expressed their support for 
Cardoso's possible presidential candidacy. The minister, 
however, said the decision will depend on popular support: 
  [Begin recording] To become a candidate, I need the people's 
votes. The moment I feel the people really want me to become a 
candidate and that they feel that by becoming a candidate I am 
not abandoning the plan, but helping making it successful, then 
I will be able to decide better. [end recording] 
  During the meeting with the businessmen, the finance 
minister 
again asserted that the implementation of the new currency, the 
real, will be announced well in advance in order not to surprise 
anyone.

<F P=106> [Article by Getulio Bittencourt from New York] </F>
  [Text] During his trip to the United States last week, the 
last question asked of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso elicited the only vague reply. So, will you run for the 
presidency of the Republic, Mr. Cardoso, or is it still a 
secret? "It is not a secret," he answered calmly, "but I still 
have to settle some things. I have not yet made up my mind." 
  The international financial community does not hide its 
preference for the finance minister as the next Brazilian 
president. Thomas J. Trebat, an executive manager from the 
Chemical Bank, contends that Cardoso is the best hope for the 
continuity of the present economic reforms under the next 
Brazilian president. 
  Tamzin Hobday, a Latin American expert at Baring Securities, 
cherishes the hope that a coalition among the PSDB [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party], the PFL [Liberal Front Party], and the 
"ethical sector" from the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party] will choose Cardoso as presidential candidate. Ed 
Cabrera, a Latin American expert at Merrill Lynch, believes that 
if Cardoso's stabilization program achieves a measure of success 
he will outpoll all the other candidates, heading a center-left 
coalition in the runoff elections.

  [Text] The Democratic Labor Party (PDT)'s preliminary 
government program is as follows: 
<H5>  Economy </H5>
  To defeat inflation by moralizing public finances, reversing 
international losses, and radically reformulating the domestic 
debt that enslaves the government to financial interests. 
  To stop international losses by reversing the transfer 
abroad 
of the net national capital flow. 
  To negotiate the foreign debt by making the interest rate 
fixed and attributing to the remaining debt an intermediate 
value situated between the nominal value and the value 
recognized in the secondary market. To subordinate the debt 
payment to the domestic economy's growth by eliminating 
speculative increases. 
  To promote auditing of the domestic debt by ascertaining 
responsibility for irregular contracting and irregular use of 
the debt with criminal accountability, whenever appropriate. 
  In the use of the exchange reserves, to give priority to the 
importation of capital goods required for updating industry and 
by not allowing these reserves to be squandered in servicing the 
foreign debt. 
  To reduce illegal currency evasion. 
<H5>  Minimum Wage </H5>
  To reinstate the minimum wage's purchasing power, based on 
studies conducted by the Interunion Department for Statistics 
and Socioeconomic Studies that indicate that the minimum wage's 
purchasing power should be $350. 
<H5>  Electoral Reform </H5>
  To implement public financing of electoral campaigns, thus 
fighting economic influences to break down the oligarchic clique 
that controls power. 
  Financial System 
  To reform the financial system by recovering the public 
indebtedness capacity and making savings-attracting and savings- 
investing instruments more adequate for the productive sector's 
long-term financing needs. 
<H5>  Agrarian Reform </H5>
  To give land to 20 million people by settling communities in 
areas neighboring secondary roads and by making use of the 
agricultural districts nuclei to create "rural cities." 
<H5>  Education </H5>

  Full-day schooling with four meals ensured per day. To 
receive at the Integrated Public Education Centers, on an 
emergency and temporary basis, poor or abandoned children from 
six to 14. 
  To organize mandatory elementary education in five years. 
The 
students' grading will be done throughout the period without the 
dreaded possibility of repeating the year, which so inhibits 
those students coming from a meeker strata of society. To have 
five years of high school education and two more years of 
university-level studies and/or two years [as published]. 
<H5>  Communication </H5>
  No one nor any group will be able to control more than 30 
percent of the social communications system in one state or the 
country. 
  No one nor any group can own a radio station, newspaper, 
magazine, or television channel at the same time. 
  Forty percent of the television programs must be produced 
locally -- 30 percent by independent producers, and only 30 
percent in national network. 
  To review the distribution of official funds allocated to 
publicity through a compensatory system that is not only 
commercial. 
  Open new credit lines for the creation of a new 
communications system in the country. The BNDES [National Bank 
for Economic and Social Development] does not make loans to 
printed communication companies compromising democratic 
plurality. 
  Stimulate research and the use of new technologies to 
produce 
and recycle paper in order to revitalize this market that is 
being threatened by external cost fluctuations. 
<H5>  Taxes </H5>
  Maintain and strengthen the goods and services distribution 
tax. 
  Create three other direct taxes: a tax on personal 
consumption (replacing the IR [income tax] and affecting the 
difference between income, savings, and investments), an assets 
tax, and a tax on the hereditary or gratuitous transfer of 
assets (inheritances, donations).

  [Text] The party leaders in the Senate and Chamber of 
Deputies today decided to accelerate the constitutional revision 
process. They spent the morning meeting with the presidents of 
the two houses. They also decided to suspend payments to the 
Judicial and Legislative Branches until the impasse over the 
wage increase is solved. 
  The constitutional revision sessions will begin earlier as 
of 
today, that is, at 1500. The PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party], the largest party in Congress, will be in charge of the 
political coordination. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays 
the PMDB will gather the leaders of the other parties to try to 
reach an agreement on the afternoon voting sessions. 
  The party leaders also decided to create two committees, one 
to deal with the Social Security reform and the other to deal 
with tax reform. Constitutional revision rapporteur Deputy 
Nelson Jobim believes this will facilitate the revision work: 
  [Begin recording] If a consensus is not reached on a subject 
it will then be voted on, approved or rejected. That is, the 
process will continue. [end recording] 
  After the meeting the presidents of the two houses announced 
they decided to suspend paying deputies, senators, and Congress 
employees until an agreement is reached on the conversion of 
salaries into URV's [Real Value Unit]. Neither Chamber of 
Deputies President Inocencio Oliveira or Senate President 
Humberto Lucena have mentioned retreating from their position 
regarding the salary increase. Nonetheless, they bet on a 
negotiated solution. 
  [Begin Humberto Lucena recording] I think we must act like 
firemen, but we must not add fuel to the fire. Now, in a 
presidential system such negotiations could only prosper by 
initiative of the president of the Republic, who is the one who 
commands the political, administrative, and institutional 
process of the country. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by local reporter Kennedy Alencar] </F>
  [Text] The Catholic Church will present the candidates for 
president with a plan for this country in which it proposes an 
end to what it calls the "democracy of the elites." The idea, 
expounded in a document obtained by FOLHA, encourages a 
political "revenge" in this year's elections: "use your vote to 
judge those congressmen and politicians who have betrayed their 
mandate from the people." 
  The document, entitled "Brazil: Alternatives and 
Protagonists," is the way the National Conference of Brazilian 
Bishops (CNBB) has chosen to influence the presidential 
election, in addition to proposing a long-term political and 
economic plan for the country. 
  Drafted by a commission from the Social Pastoral office of 
the CNBB, the text says that Brazil is a "society in which only 
a democracy of the elites is practiced" and in which 
"consultation with the citizens is avoided and feared." The 
Church appeals for changes that must occur in a society that is 
"stupefied" by the events that led to the impeachment of Collor 
and the proposal to expel and strip political rights from 
corrupt congressmen. 
  The document is the result of a consolidation of documents 
contributed by 14 regional units of the CNBB, which held 
meetings with civic organizations. The CNBB proposal will be 
discussed during the Second Brazilian Social Week (24 to 29 July 
in Brasilia) and presented to the presidential candidates during 
an evening of debate. Father Inacio Neitzling, coordinator of 
the commission, says it is a "controversial document that is 
intended to be discussed and will provoke plenty of debate both 
within and outside the Church." The meeting is likely to be the 
scene of a clash between progressive and conservative elements 
in the Church. 
  The bishop of Jales (Sao Paulo State), Dom Luiz Demetrio 
Valentini, head of the Social Pastoral office, says "it is more 
than legitimate that the CNBB get involved in the elections and 
submit alternatives, not just for the immediate future, but for 
the long term as well." According to Valentini, the document 
does not support any individual candidate. It does, however, 
identify similarities between the CNBB proposals and ideas 
advanced by the PT [Workers Party], the PSDB [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party], and sections of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party] and the PDT [Democratic Labor Party]. 
  The document, to be released nationwide on 24 March, 
contains 
detailed proposals for an economic model, agrarian reform, 
education, the media, Mercosur [Common Market of the South], the 
role of the Armed Forces, and military and civilian policies. 
Final touches are still being put on proposals pertaining to the 
environment, the judiciary, urban renewal, health, and specific 
suggestions for each region of the country. The plan will be 
debated at the meeting in July and may be modified. 
<H5>  Educational Change Makes Greatest "Impact" </H5>
  The Church document calls education the priority "of 
greatest 
impact" to change the country, something that "will genuinely 
ensure the distribution of income and social justice." The 
subject is seen as the basic condition for development and the 
exercise of citizenship. The chief proposal in this area is the 
adoption of full-day school sessions. 
  The part of the document that deals with agrarian reform 
states that in Brazil there is an unlimited right of ownership 
that has created "a capitalistic monopoly on farmland." 
Apparently born of free enterprise, the property 
right--according to the text--has been translated into the 
practice of "using and abusing the entire extension of land that 
you buy." The Church believes agrarian reform "is urgently 
needed" in order to democratize Brazilian society. 
  With respect to the media, the document points to 
"contradictory" aspects in assessing its "near indispensability" 
and the need to democratize the media organizations. According 
to the text, there is a "scandalous" degree of concentration in 
that sector. "About 90 percent of everything that Brazilians 
read, hear, and see through the media is controlled by fewer 
than nine families." 
  The Church criticizes the means by which the Mercosur (the 
common market formed by Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and 
Paraguay) was created, stating that only economic interests were 
considered and that "human and social aspects" were left out. In 
the opinion of the Church, the "Rio-Sao Paulo industrial axis" 
and the "Argentine agroindustrial complex" are the only 
beneficiaries, because of their competitive clout. The Church 
suggests a plebiscite. 
  The text states that the "military apparatus has been taken 
over by arbitrariness and prepotency." And it proposes that 
"society should control" the military and police forces. The 
Church finds that there is now "proximity between the police and 
illegal groups" such as the death squads, the narcotics traffic, 
and criminal elements. 
<H5>  Excerpts </H5>
  In analyzing the performance of the politicians: "Elected 
officials, in the name of representation but with their backs 
turned, sneakily act according to their own personal 
inclinations and protect the interests of the privileged." 
  On the subject of the media: "It is important to accentuate 
the fact that although the power of the communications media in 
Brazil today seems almost absolute and totalitarian, it does, 
like all institutions throughout history, have its 
contradictions and limitations." 
  On Mercosur: "It is surprising to see how this agreement is 
being worked out solely on the basis of the interests of 
businessmen and traders." 
  On the Armed Forces and the police: "This armed wing of the 
state has on various occasions constituted itself as a truly 
independent force that has often taken upon itself the 
responsibility to determine the course of the Brazilian nation, 
as was the case in the recent period of military dictatorship." 
<H5>  Constitutional Revision is "Deplorable" </H5>
  The constitutional revision is described as a "deplorable 
spectacle staged by the National Congress," according to the 
CNBB text. The document observes that the way the revision of 
the Constitution is being handled endangers "the democractic 
fellowship." 
  The document expresses the belief that the revision is being 
done hurriedly, with participation by lobbies from the federal 
government, the military, and other groups--especially the 
national and international business community. The document 
asks: "Might this be the last chance to revisit the Constitution 
with a view to inserting in it the implantation of the 
neoliberalism imposed by the IMF and by the interests that 
represent and are accepted by almost all the Brazilian elites?" 
<H5>  The Main Proposals By the Church </H5>
  The Economic Model: 

  -  Rejection of the neoliberal model and attempt to construct 
a new model as a paradigm of modernity 
  -  An economy that 
prioritizes the social and subordinates the economic 
  -  Alternative 
government policies based on the experiences of grass-roots 
entities in civilian society

  -  Social pact between the principal economic, political, 
social, and cultural agents 
  -  Deprivatization of the State and

each region, the least cultivated, and those that either do the 
most environmental damage or most seriously impede a healthy 
environment 
  -  Agricultural credit and technical assistance to 
small farmers, with adoption of alternative agro-ecological 
methods appropriate to each region 
  -  Guaranteed means of 
transporting, warehousing, and marketing the products 

    Mercosur: 

  -  Plebescite on the terms of the agreement 
  -  Extension of 
deadlines for opening up borders, to allow countries to better

<F P=106> [Article by Fernando Canzian and Fernanda Godoy] </F>
  [Text] The Creditor Bank Advisory Committee at 1709 
yesterday (1909 Brasilia time) released a communique informing 
the international financial community that Brazil is willing to 
conclude on 15 April an agreement to renegotiate its foreign 
debt. The advisory committee's "waiver" will permit the 
conclusion of an agreement on the $35 billion debt owed to 
private creditor banks without the guarantee ("standby") of the 
International Monetary Fund. 
  With a speech delivered in New York, and with the tone of a 
candidate for president, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso took advantage of the proximity of the conclusion of the 
agreement. 
  At least two-thirds of private creditor banks (out of a 
total 
of 440) need to give a positive answer to the Advisory 
Committee's waiver before 24 March. If this does not happen 
Brazil will need the IMF guarantee to sign the agreement. The 
Committee's communique recommends that banks endorse the 
agreement. 
  During an interview at the Intercontinental Hotel yesterday, 
where he is staying, Cardoso said he is sure that creditor banks 
would agree to the Advisory Committee's suggestion. 
  On 16 March the IMF refused to guarantee the agreement, 
compelling Brazil to provide by itself -- without money from 
international financial organizations -- the guarantees demanded 
by creditor banks. On 15 April, Brazil will have to prove to 
creditor banks that it has $2.8 billion in zero-coupons (U.S. 
Treasury bonds with a 30-year maturity period and zero interest) 
to guarantee the agreement. 
  "Brazil is a prudent country, and will know how to present 
that guarantee," Cardoso said, without specifying whether the 
country has already purchased the coupons from the secondary 
market. Brazil could have purchased the bonds from the U.S. 
Treasury at a lower price if it had had the IMF "standby." 
According to the minister, the bonds will be deposited at the 
BIS (Bank of International Settlements) in Basil, Switzerland, 
on the date the agreement is signed. Financial market sources 
have said that Brazil has already purchased those coupons. 
  The minister said the final negotiation of the debt 
agreement 
was "a nice, well-designed operation." But he refused to say 
when or how Brazil purchased the zero-coupons that will be used 
as a guarantee for the exchange of Brazilian debt certificates. 
  Cardoso said the agreement proves that Brazil is a "solvent" 
country and "promotes economic growth, reduces the Brazilian 
risk, and reduces international interest rates for the country." 
Cardoso added that "the end" of the debt problem will make 
growth more feasible, and will "strengthen any candidacy 
supporting an economic program like the one we proposed." 
  He said Brazil has turned over a new leaf. "I am 
particularly satisfied, because I have accompanied this process 
for 11 years, since the time I was a senator," the minister 
said. The signing of the agreement, he said, will facilitate 
the entry of foreign financial resources into the Brazilian 
economy. "The Brazilian risk will have to drop, the `spread' 
[preceding word in English] (interest surcharge) will have to 
drop," he said.

  [Text] The government has begun to regulate the 
adjustments of public rates and prices, using the Real Value 
Unit (URV)'s variations. Airline tickets already may be 
adjusted using URV's. Afterward, it will be fuel, electricity, 
and postal rates' turn. 
  Resolution No. 134, signed on 18 March in Brasilia, 
authorizes the adjustments of airline tickets, using the 
previous period, that is, on the 1st, 11th, and 21st of every 
month. The 11 March increase had been postponed waiting for 
this guideline. Airline companies still are negotiating the 
conversion of airline tickets into URV's. Two weeks ago, 
airline companies increased tickets 26.33 percent. 
  The other rates also will be indexed using URV's, but they 
will still be expressed in real cruzeiros to avoid losses in the 
collections by state-run companies over the conversion [into 
URV's] by using the average prices of the last four months of 
1993, as determined by Provisional Measure No. 434. Finance 
Ministry experts reported that the next increase will be 
implemented in April, already using the URV's variation. 
  This regulation is not compulsory for the rates of state-run 
companies. The federal government will monitor the variation in 
these state rates to prevent abusive adjustments. 
  In Sao Paulo, Finance Ministry special adviser Jose Milton 
Dallari on 21 March asked the manufacturers of car paints -- 
Basf, Renner, and Akzo -- for an explanation of prices in URV's 
between 15- and 20-percent higher than the average prices of the 
last four months of 1993. The entrepreneurs told him the 
increase was caused by a price increase in vinyl acetate, a raw 
material manufactured only by Rhodia. Dallari asked them to 
send him a cost sheet by 25 March. If the explanations are 
unconvincing, he said, this case may be submitted to the free 
competition defense organizations for consideration under the 
law on oligopolies control. 
  The Finance Ministry adviser also met meat-packing plant 
owners and transportation company executives. The National 
Association of Overland Transportation Companies reported that 
it already has been implementing the adjustments using the URV's 
for one week with an 11- to 20-percent reduction in freight 
charges, depending on the cargo, and the removal of financial 
costs and inflation adjustments. A National Association of 
Overland Transportation Companies director said the reduction 
will be maintained if the manufacturing companies do the same. 
  In Dallari's opinion, most entrepreneurial circles "still 
are 
negotiating and seeking an agreement." He said it is quite 
likely that by late March most prices will still be adjusted by 
using real cruzeiros. 
  In Rio de Janeiro, pharmaceutical representatives on 21 
March 
delivered to Finance Ministry experts in Rio de Janeiro 
documents with information on the variation of their prices 
since the URV's implementation. The data will be reviewed by 
Jose Milton Dallari, who already has declared that he believes 
the price adjustments of medicines are high and that he will ask 
for a revision. The meeting had been scheduled to begin at 1400 
with the presence of Dallari, who was delayed in Sao Paulo. 
  At Dallari's request, the meeting was not canceled, but his 
absence somewhat minimized the meeting's importance. Some 
important pharmaceutical entrepreneurs preferred not to attend 
the meeting.

<F P=106> [Report by George Vidor] </F>
  [Text] Brazil has dropped its project to enrich uranium 
through the German jet nozzle process. But not all of the 
nearly $500 million invested in Nuclei's unfinished industrial 
facilities in Resende (RJ) [Rio de Janeiro] will be wasted. 
Brazilian Nuclear Industry, the group's holding company, 
intends to use part of the equipment to transform the imported 
enriched uranium into powder and then into pellets. The pellets 
will then be transformed into the fuel elements, which are 
currently made by another company branch. 
  In order to make this adaptation viable it will be necessary 
to invest an additional $15 million in the Nuclei facilities. 
Only South Africa and Brazil have built installations to enrich 
uranium through the jet nozzle process. But the project is 
today considered economically unfeasible, besides having been 
questioned in scientific circles. 
  Jet nozzle technology involves the separation of uranium's 
heaviest isotopes (238) from lighter ones (235). In this 
process the uranium ore is made to circulate in a gaseous form 
(hexafluoride) through equipment operating successive cascades. 
The predominant uranium enriching process in the world today is 
called the ultracentrifuge process. In this process the 
machines rotate instead of the gas (uranium remains in solid 
state up to a temperature of 56 degrees centigrade. At higher 
temperatures it becomes uranium hexafluoride gas). 
  A proposal studied earlier was to incorporate Nuclei 
facilities into the Aramar project that is being built by the 
Navy, which developed its own untracentrifuge technology to 
supply fuel to the nuclear submarine now under construction. 
The idea did not prosper because Nuclei was designed to produce 
160,000 enriched uranium units a year (enough to supply the 
Angra-2 and Angra-3 power plants), while the submarine will only 
need 1,000 units.

<F P=106> [Article by Francisca Stella Fraga from Sao Paulo] </F>
  [Text] As of June 1992, when the UN Conference on 
Environment and Development -- Rio '92 -- approved Agenda 21 
that establishes that the rich countries must supply new 
resources in favorable conditions to developing countries so 
they can protect the environment, the Brazilian Government's 
strategy for negotiating external financing in this sector 
became based on that principle. Meanwhile, organizations such as 
the World Bank continue to insist on traditional financing 
criteria for releasing resources for environmental projects. 
  This criteria has been one of the most serious obstacles to 
implementing projects that follow the Rio '92 objectives to open 
the way for sustainable development, according to Pedro Mota 
Coelho, chief of Itamaraty's Environment Division. The demand 
that Brazil put up matching funds for the financing of 
environmental projects that is systematically imposed by the 
World Bank is an evident example that the bank is using 
traditional credit mechanisms. According to Mota Coelho, the 
demand goes against the guidelines contained in Agenda 21, 
especially in the cases in which the World Bank acts as an 
intermediary in obtaining resources from the rich countries, 
such as the case of resources for the Ozone Fund, which was 
created to finance projects for preventing the destruction of 
the earth's ozone layer. 
  "The release of resources must have a better flow," Mota 
Coelho said. "It is clear that we must do our lessons at home, 
and that is what we are doing." 
  And it is this effort that is being incorporated into the 
task of a group being coordinated by the Planning Secretariat of 
the presidency, in other words, Seplan [Secretariat of Planning 
and Coordination of the Presidency of the Republic] -- which 
involves the Environment, Finance, and Foreign Ministries, among 
others -- was created in order to specifically simplify the 
forms and mechanisms for the reception of external resources. 
"At this stage, even the reception of donations is very 
difficult," Mota Coelho said. 
<H5>  Denmark </H5>
  This is why Environment Minister Rubens Ricupero frequently 
has repeated during financing negotiations that Brazil is not 
Denmark. If it was, then its institutions would function 
magnificently and the public organizations involved in the 
environmental field would be perfectly structured to comply with 
their functions. But even if this was true, financing would not 
be necessary either. Among its numerous shortcomings, Brazil 
needs resources in order to improve its organizations. 
<H5>  Guideline Changes </H5>
  Environment Ministry executive secretary Sergio Silva do 
Amaral stressed that Brazil's environmental sector has had 
considerable changes in guidelines during the past few years and 
this has caused a major lack of stability. The Ibama [Brazilian 
Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources], 
which was created in 1989, has had nine presidents in a 
four-year period; and the Environment Secretariat and the 
Environment Ministry also have changed chiefs fives times since 
1992. In addition, Ibama does not have the resources to handle 
complex international negotiations. Four hundred technicians 
were trained recently to handle this, he stated. 
  Amaral also stated that the Federal Government's budget 
restrictions do not help in releasing matching funds for 
financing. This even affected the National Environment Program, 
the PNMA, which was instituted precisely in order to improve the 
public administration's efficiency in the environmental field. 
The PNMA is now 36 months old but has only received regular 
budgetary resources for the past 17 months. According to the 
PNMA, the government is restructuring in order to improve its 
evaluation of the specific situation of each project in order to 
prevent this from continuing. 
<H5>  Simplifying Problems </H5>
  According to Amaral, another effort that has been made is 
that of seeking an understanding with the government's economic 
sector in order to simplify the procedures for the release of 
external resources. He states that there has been progress 
regarding the mechanisms of the National Environment Fund 
(FNMA), which is financed by the Inter-American Development Bank 
(IDB). The economic sector's green light for the use of 
resources was so delayed that at times it passed from one fiscal 
year to the next year and this demanded new agreements, within 
an infinite process of bureaucratic actions, for the use of the 
resources. 
  Amaral now says it is possible to use the balance from one 
fiscal year the next year without signing new agreements. 
  He also stresses that the World Bank itself is contributing 
to the delay in approving projects. It has the habit of 
delaying in order to evaluate and name consultants. In 
addition, the projects are revised very frequently. This why 
the Brazilian Government has suggested that the World Bank also 
should adopt more rapid measures where it is concerned. 
  The external resources the Brazilian Government has 
negotiated for the environmental field are divided into four 
areas: 


    -  Amazon Pilot Project: To be financed by the seven 
richest nations in the World -- the Group of 7 -- for the 
preservation of Brazil's tropical forests. The initial 
provision made in 1990, when the project was approved by the 
member countries in Houston, amounted to $1.6 billion. During 
the 1991 Geneva meeting it was agreed that the first part of the 
resources -- $250 million -- would be released and 12 projects 
were approved. Of the 12 projects, seven are very well advanced 
in their drafting. But the resources have not been released 
yet. 
  -  Projects for biodiversity preservation that are to be 
financed with a fund of $18 million from the resources of the 
Global Environment Facility [title published in English] (GEF), 
which was created in 1991 and is supported by the World Bank, in 
addition to the $18 million Brazil will have to put up in 
matching funds. The GEF also has promised to release $30 
million for other environmental projects and the Brazilian 
Government promised $12 million in matching funds. 
  -  The 
restructuring of Brazilian organizations involved in the 
environmental sector. The PNMA has contracted financing of $117 
million with the World Bank in order to strengthen the country's 
environmental institutions and organizations, to implement 
projects to protect natural resources, and to support projects 
for the decentralization of environmental activities. 
  -  The FNMA 
was created with capital of $22 million from the IDB and $8 
million in government matching funds for the financing of low- 
cost projects -- up to $200,000 -- for the preservation of 
environmental areas, research, biodiversity, and activities 
pertaining to environmental preservation. This is a 
little-known program that can be used by municipalities and 
nongovernmental organizations. Some of the funds already are 
being used.

  [Text] Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] will 
invest $85 million this year in making surveys of seismic data 
and drilling wells in the Santos basin, a 350,000 sq km area 
extending from Cabo Frio (Rio de Janeiro State) to Santa 
Catarina. At present, Petrobras is keeping three probes busy 
drilling wells in the Santos basin, and a fourth will be 
installed next week. 
  "The goal of this effort is to find alternatives to the 
Campos Basin in Rio (the company's main drilling site). The 
potential for new offshore petroleum discoveries in the Santos 
basin is very high," said Dimas Dultra Simoes, assistant 
superintendent of operations for Petrobras's exploration 
department. 
  According to Simoes, the Santos basin has an estimated 
potential of 200 million barrels of oil equivalent. The fields 
already discovered in that basin are Tubarao, Coral, Estrela do 
Mar, Merluza, and Caravelas. One of the producing wells in the 
Caravelas field, 1-BSS-64, has the highest flow rate of any in 
Brazil, contributing about 10,000 barrels of petroleum a day. 
  Of the three wells now being drilled, the 1-BSS-74, located 
180 km off Sao Sebastiao, on the Sao Paulo coast, is the first 
deepwater well in Sao Paulo. It is 1,140 meters deep. "That well 
is in the final drilling stages. Within the next several days, 
we will find out if there is oil there," Simoes said. The other 
two wells are the 1-BSS-72 and the Caravelas, an extension of 
the Caravelas field. 
  The Santos basin has also shown good prospects as a source 
of 
natural gas. The Merluza field has an average production of 
600,000 cubic meters of gas per day and a potential to reach the 
2 million cubic meter/day level. The field has proven reserves 
of 13 billion cubic meters of natural gas. 
  According to Simoes, interest in exploiting the Santos basin 
increased after the seismic data survey done by ship from 1992 
to early 1993. In that effort, which involved an investment of 
$15 million, a radiography was made of the subsoil, surveying 
the best sites to drill wells. "At the moment, Petrobras is 
studying an integrated project to boost production in the 
basin," he said.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 17 
March. 
  The Brazilian Petroleum Corporation will invest $42.2 
million 
in 1994-97 to develop oil byproducts from the Marlim and 
Albacora oil fields located in the Campos Basin. It is expected 
that this program will generate approximately $1 billion in 
profits between 1995 and 2001. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in 
Portuguese 10 Mar 94 p 15) 
  On 9 March, British Treasury Secretary Michael Portillo met 
Brazilian Aeronautics Minister Lelio Viana Lobo to discuss the 
sale to Brazil of eight Rolls-Royce engines worth $100 million 
for three Boeing 777 planes. British Ambassador to Brazil Peter 
Heap said Transbrasil and the British company have not yet 
signed a sale contract but a letter of intent. (Sao Paulo GAZETA 
MERCANTIL in Portuguese 10 Mar 94 p 6) 
  On 9 March, President Itamar Franco signed a decree 
establishing two new free zones in the municipalities of 
Brasileia/Epitaciolandia and Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre State. A 
total of seven areas already have been placed under the special 
fiscal system in the country. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in 
Portuguese 10 Mar 94 p 6) 
  Rio Doce Valley Company's vice president, Anastacio Ubaldino 
Fernandes Filho, reported that the company is planning to trade 
future gold production in the international market, through 
which it expects to attract $180 million in foreign capital. 
Fernandes said the company is analyzing proposals by financial 
institutions to mediate in the operation. (Sao Paulo GAZETA 
MERCANTIL in Portuguese 10 Mar 94 pp 1-22) 
  Tax revenues increased 24 percent in February, a drop of 9 
percent compared with January, but an increase of 40.38 percent 
compared with the same month last year. (Sao Paulo GAZETA 
MERCANTIL in Portuguese 14 Mar 94 p 5) 
  Fuel prices were adjusted 19.5 percent as of 14 March. The 
prices of alcohol, gasoline, diesel oil, and cooking gas have 
increased 124.86 percent so far this year. The last 18.5 percent 
readjustment was decreed on 24 February. (Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- The current wave of kidnappings 
and holdups has demonstrated to police the new guidelines of the 
two main organized crime branches in Rio de Janeiro State. 
According to Helio Vigio, chief of the DAS [Counter-Kidnapping 
Headquarters], the main drug traffickers from the Comando 
Vermelho and Terceiro Comando gangs have established illegal 
enterprises to supply men and weapons and plan the collection of 
ransom, and they even have experts to negotiate with the 
kidnapped victims' families. 
  According to police, Flavio Negao, from the Vigario Geral 
slum, and Orlando Jogador, from the Alemao and Marcelo Xara 
slums on Varginha Hill, besides being drug traffickers also 
kidnapped people and stole bullion in the past four months. "The 
news now is that smaller gangs are kidnapping minor businessmen 
to raise money to buy drugs," said Inspector Placidio Guimaraes, 
DAS operations chief. 
  Other gangs, like that of drug trafficker Robertinho from 
Parada de Lucas slum, which is linked to the Terceiro Commando, 
rent sophisticated weapons for kidnapping and bullion robbery 
operations. They also provide men for operations in exchange for 
a percentage of the ransom. Joel de Oliveira Carvalho says he is 
"an expert in negotiating with the victims' families" and also 
provides other services to kidnappers. 
  Vigio says drug traffickers usually buy drugs in return. "If 
police discovers one of their drug caches, they need to find 
money quickly to buy more drugs and not lose their supplier," he 
said. 
  According to DAS, there currently are seven kidnapped people 
in Rio de Janeiro.

  [Text] Sao Jose dos Campos--In celebration of the Data 
Collection Satellite (SCD-1)'s first year in orbit, Minister of 
Science and Technology Jose Israel Vargas and the director of 
the National Institute of Space Research (INPE), Marcio Nogueira 
Barbosa, announced yesterday in Sao Jose dos Campos that the 
Brazilian satellite's services will be expanded to include 
scientific institutions in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia 
that have already asked the Brazilian institute to install data 
collection platforms in their territories. Top INPE officials 
are meeting in Brasilia today with leaders from 10 African 
countries, also interested in using the satellite's resources. 
  According to Minister Israel Vargas, the Brazilian Space 
Agency, a civilian body, will circumvent the boycotts 
encountered by Brazil in the transfer of sensitive technology 
from the developed nations. "Our space program is strictly 
peaceful," he observed. 
  In the minister's opinion, the new space agency will enable 
Brazil to enter the low-altitude communications satellite 
market. "One of the agency's first assignments is to reexamine 
the entire Brazilian space program," he said. 
  At present, the Ministry of Science and Technology has 
signed 
major space cooperation agreements with China and is studying a 
partnership with Argentina.

  [Text] Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage said that exports 
of Cuban medicines could serve as part of the payment of its $48 
million debt to Brazil. Two weeks ago, the two countries signed 
an agreement worth $30 million covering the purchase of about 
200 kinds of medicines for distribution in public health 
programs. 
  Lage said the shipment of meningitis vaccine that Brazil 
bought, on which the "use by" dates had expired, will be 
exchanged free of charge. "That is all we can do," he said. On a 
four-day visit to Brazil, Lage also hopes to advance some 
technical-scientific cooperation projects in the petrochemicals 
and tourism areas. "We are open to foreign capital, and are 
specifically interested in Brazil because it is the largest 
country in Latin America," he said.

  [Excerpt] Defense Minister Edmundo Perez and General 
Augusto Pinochet today met for more than four hours at the Armed 
Forces building. Perez's visit was an unprecedented event in the 
past four years considering that former Defense Minister 
Patricio Rojas never visited this place. 
  However, the guards stood in line early today to honor the 
minister. Perez, who accepted the commander in chief's 
invitation, was warmly welcomed by Gen. Pinochet. This gesture 
adds to others that clearly show the mutual wish to improve the 
links between the Army and the government that started under the 
Coalition of Parties' administration. Pinochet, accompanied by 
Army Deputy Commander Jorge Lucar, introduced Perez to all 
members of the General Staff. Each officer briefed Perez on the 
Army's mission and organization. 
  After the approximately four-hour visit to the Armed Forces 
building, Perez agreed to talk with the press for the first time 
since he was installed as defense minister: 
  [Begin recording] [Perez] I think relations are improving. 
The good relations under President Aylwin's administration 
gradually increased and I am only trying to deepen them. 
  [Unidentified reporter] But there were problems under the 
former administration. Do you think they will occur again? 
  [Perez] I don't think so; I do not perceive them in the 
current atmosphere. 
  [Reporter] Do you maintain a good personal relation with 
Gen. 
Pinochet? 
  [Perez] I do not think it is appropriate to talk about 
personal relations, but about relations between a defense 
minister and a commander in chief within the existing legal 
framework. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] In a surprise move and after a long refusal, the 
Army has given its approval for Colombia to sign the Geneva 
Convention Protocol No. 2. The signing of this agreement grants 
the guerrillas the status of a belligerent force, and guarantees 
that the conflicts with the government will be ruled by 
international humanitarian law. Here is Monica Echeverry: 
  [Begin recording] [Echeverry] With a note sent by the 
defense 
minister and the Armed Forces commander to President Gaviria, 
Colombia accepts the signing of the Geneva Convention Protocol 
No. 2 following years of all-out opposition. Thus, Colombia 
acknowledges that it is in a state of war. 
  [Gustavo Rodriguez Vargas, member of the Foreign Ministry 
Advisory Commission] I believe it makes the conflict more real. 
The conflict is placed within parameters that at any given 
moment can be more manageable for a government. 
  [Echeverry] In addition to this, with the signing of 
Protocol 
No. 2, a code of ethics for war is established and the rebels 
are given the status of a belligerent force. The rebels must 
now accept the humanitarian law, which involves the presence of 
a UN overseeing group in the peace talks. The agreement must be 
presented to Congress, where it will be approved. Thus, the 
government moves a step ahead of Samper's star proposal to 
advance peace, and it also opens the doors for a new peace 
dialogue with the guerrillas. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] The Conservative Party gained 18 new 
congressional seats in Sunday's elections. Its number of Senate 
members rose from 22 to 31, and in the Chamber of 
Representatives, where up until now it had 50 representatives, 
it will now have 59. 
  These results, added to the fact the party has been 
consolidated as the nation's second leading political force, are 
a cause of satisfaction for its directors, and it has them 
thinking once again that the possibility of attaining the 
Presidency is very close. 
  "We are united, and leadership under Andres Pastrana has 
generated enthusiasm among the voters. The results are now 
becoming evident," stated Eugenio Merlano, secretary general of 
the National Conservative Directorate [DNC]. 
  He has also hailed the fact Fabio Valencia Cossio, 
conservative leader from Antioquia and one of Pastrana's main 
supporters, had obtained the second highest number of votes in 
the nation. 
  The conservative leaders interpret this fact as a bow to the 
good work Antioquia Governor Juan Gomez Martinez and Medellin 
Mayor Luis Alfredo Ramos Botero are carrying out. 
  The conservatives' optimism is based on the fact that almost 
all of their candidates were elected. All five candidates 
presented for the Senate by the New Democratic Force, a movement 
from which Andres Pastrana rose, were elected. 
  The sole exception was the National Salvation Movement, 
which 
although it obtain two senate seats, only garnered one 
representative in the Chamber of Representatives. 
  It was surprising that the parliamentaries closer to Andres 
Pastrana, including Fabio Valencia, were the ones who obtained 
some of the highest number of votes in the nation, as did Jorge 
Hernandez Restrepo, Claudia Blum, and Gustavo Galvis. [passage

  [Text] Industry and Commerce Minister Ubaldo Scavone said 
on 21 March that an eventual negotiation between NAFTA -- 
comprising Mexico, the United States, and Canada -- and Mercosur 
[Common Market of the South] should be conducted at the bloc 
level instead of the bilateral level. 
  According to Scavone, Paraguay upholds that negotiations 
should be conducted through economic blocs. Scavone thus 
responded to reports from Argentina -- one of the Mercosur 
members along with Paraguay, Brazil, and Uruguay -- stating that 
it is allegedly negotiating its entrance into NAFTA. 
  Asked what will be done if it is confirmed that Argentina is 
negotiating its entrance into NAFTA at the bilateral level, 
Scavone said something will be done in this regard and Paraguay 
may submit a claim within Mercosur. 
  Argentina's alleged request to enter NAFTA was one of the 
mandatory issues discussed by those who attended the lecture 
David Rockefeller gave on 21 March at the Business 
Administration School (EDAN). 
  In this regard, Rockefeller said Chile is "at the top of the 
list" but Argentina may be a firm candidate in view of 
"impressive changes" implemented in the last few years. 
  Scavone stated that the integration theory presupposes the 
achievement of a series of agreements on several issues. He 
said: "It was fairly easy to achieve the elimination of customs 
tariffs. But issues such as the establishment of a single 
customs tariff demand the simultaneous compatibility of 
macroeconomic policies. This is what Dr. Rockefeller said." 
  Rockefeller said the socioeconomic development of each 
individual country also guarantees the success of any economic 
bloc.

  [Text] The Hague, 22 Mar (EFE) -- Surinamese President 
Ronald Venetiaan expressed his willingness to hold a dialogue 
with the rebels who seized a hydroelectric dam and are holding 
30 workers hostage, the Dutch agency ANP reported from 
Paramaribo today. 
  On 21 March, 100 guerrillas of the self-styled Liberation 
Front of Suriname seized the Afobaka Dam, located 100 km south 
of Paramaribo, and mined its main access roads. 
  The rebel group is holding 30 workers of the Suralco mining 
company hostage and threatening to blow up the dam at 1400 today 
Dutch time (1300 GMT), leaving Paramaribo without electricity, 
if the government does not resign. 
  In addition to President Venetiaan's resignation, the Front 
demands a broad program to improve "the critical economic 
situation" as well as health and education services for the 
population. 
  The group is also asking for the withdrawal of a Canadian 
company that extracts gold in various concessions in the 
interior of the country and that the mining rights be granted to 
Surinamers. 
  In an appeal to the population, Venetiaan asked for a 
dialogue with the rebels to reach a peaceful solution to the 
conflict, ANP revealed from the former Dutch colony in northern 
South America. 
  The president added, however, that violence does not solve 
anything and that "terrorism will never force me to resign."

  [Text] The Hague (the Netherlands), 22 Mar (EFE) -- The 
Dutch ANP press agency is reporting from Suriname that large 
areas of the capital of Paramaribo were left without power today 
after a group of rebels seized a hydroelectric dam. 
  The Liberation Front of Suriname (FLS) has controlled the 
Afobaka Dam, 100 km south of Paramaribo, since 21 March and has 
mined its main access roads. 
  A spokesman for the Suriname Power Co. confirmed that one of 
the dam's generators, which provides energy to Paramaribo, is no 
longer operating. 
  The FLS, which is holding 30 employees of the "Suralco" 
mining company hostage, is demanding the resignation of the 
government headed by President Ronald Venetiaan. The FLS also 
is requesting improvements in national sanitation and education 
services. 
  Meanwhile, Stanley Rensch, leader of the "Moiwana 86," a 
pro-human rights organization, will attempt to mediate between 
the armed group and the government. He also will seek the 
release of the hostages. 
  On 21 March, the guerrillas issued an ultimatum, which 
expired at 1000 (1300 GMT) today. In the ultimatum, the rebels 
threatened to blow up the Afokaba Dam if their demands were not 
met. 
  President Venetiaan vowed he would not give into terrorist 
pressure, but he expressed his willingness to hold a dialogue 
with the rebels in an effort to resolve the conflict. 
  The ANP press agency added that Cornelis Maisi, a famous 
criminal who escaped from prison several months ago, is leading 
the guerrillas.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Suriname Continues To Reject IMF </F>
Supervision"] 
  [Text] Surinamese President Venetiaan is continuing to 
reject the monitoring of economic reform by the IMF. The 
president was reacting to an agreement reached in New York on 
Saturday, 19 March, between Netherlands Development Cooperation 
Minister Pronk, the IMF, and Surinamese Foreign Minister Mungra 
and Planning and Development Cooperation Minister Assen. 
  After the meeting Pronk said that Paramaribo had agreed to 
IMF monitoring of the structural modification program which the 
Surinamese economy was to undergo. The IMF will report progress 
made each quarteron. The state of affairs and the Netherlands 
will decide on this basis whether or not Suriname will receive 
or how much money Suriname will receive as support for its 
balance of payments, the minister said. 
  But Venetiaan refused on Sunday to commit himself. "We have 
not yet made any decision. First, we want to see what demands 
are made," the president said in his initial reaction to IMF 
monitoring. Paramaribo has always resisted IMF checks on the 
grounds that the institution would support excessively rigorous 
economic cuts. Suriname wanted the British Warwick Institute to 
follow up the process rather than the IMF. But the Warwick 
Institute indicated that it wanted to do no more than assist the 
IMF. In addition this was unacceptable to the Netherlands. 
  The Development Cooperation Ministry was assuming yesterday 
that the agreements made on Saturday were valid. "If two 
prominent Surinamese Government ministers agree on something 
like this, then it is serious business," Pronk's spokesman said. 
He added that the agreements still had to be approved by IMF 
Director Camdessus and President Venetiaan. 
  Before his departure for New York on Friday, Pronk said that 
Suriname had to decide in the near future about the monitoring 
of the recovery program. Elections would soon be held in the 
Netherlands, followed by the formation of a new cabinet, and 
according to the minister, that could lead "to a huge amount of 
lost time" in the resumption of aid to Suriname, Pronk's 
spokesman said. On the basis of the 1992 Framework Treaty, 
Suriname is still due approximately 1.2 billion guilders for 
items including balance of payments support, subject to the 
condition that it takes measures to boost the economy. If 
everything goes well, this support will be spread over 
approximately 10 years. It is separate from project aid, which 
is continuing normally and remains outside IMF monitoring. The 
Netherlands is providing this aid for social facilities, 
education, health care, and infrastructure.

  [Text] The "Lainists" [supporters of Domingo Laino, leader 
of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party-PLRA] yesterday won the 
PLRA internal elections to renew the rank-and-file committees 
and to elect convention members. This time this group's 
electoral popularity dropped considerably; it even lost in 
districts, which until recently were considered undefeatable 
bastions of this PLRA faction. 
  The "Lainists" by last night had obtained 60 percent of the 
national votes, while in last year's elections it received more 
than 80 percent. 
  The general trend showed that the appearance of independent 
lists (not aligned to national movements), in addition of 
becoming the third force, were the main element draining power 
from the Change for Liberation Movement headed by Domingo Laino. 
  The "Saguierists," [supporters of Deputy Hermes Rafael 
Saguier and Senator Miguel Saguier] which at the closure of the 
vote count were in second place (with more than 10 percent of 
the votes), increased their power in the capital where they have 
taken over committees previously run by "Lainists." 
  The cities of Villarrica and Coronel Oviedo provided some 
surprises for Laino supporters. 
  These two cities were considered bastions of the Change for 
Liberation Movement, but the voters preferred the lists not tied 
to the official leadership. 
  The "Change for Change" Movement headed by Senator Alfredo 
Luis Jaegli is in third place (regarding national movements). 
This movement mostly comprises dissidents of the Laino 
movement, independents, and small regional movements. It 
obtained results considered "excellent" by the movement's main 
leaders. 
  The elections were held in a relatively calm environment 
even 
though conflicts almost developed over problems related to the 
registered voters issue. 
  As it is known charges were made over the voters registry -- 
and the way it was distributed -- which did not include many 
party members who were not able to vote because their names 
"disappeared" from the lists.

  [Excerpt] Leaders of the Employees and Workers Union of the 
National Directorate for Civilian Aviation (SEODINAC) have 
expressed concern because no attention has yet been given to 
several reports of irregularities submitted to the 
Administrative Council of the DINAC [National Directorate for 
Civilian Aviation]. 
  The union said: "We are facing a worrisome situation over 
the 
entry of 104 kg of radioactive material under the UN Development 
Program through the Silvio Pettirossi International Airport." 
  The union added that the situation is worse because the 
highly dangerous cargo left the airport jurisdiction under a 
regulation called "cargo to be regularized" which can be 
considered legalized smuggling. 
  The union commented that approximately 18 months ago two 
small cans of radioactive material were found at the airport. 
The case was made public but nobody knew anything about how 
they appeared. 
  The union stated: "Documents now in our possession open the 
way to a thorough investigation that could expose a new face in 
the trafficking of prohibited merchandise through our airport." 
  The union believes several people are responsible for the 
entry of nuclear material into the country: One is Colonel Ramon 
Dardo Guerra, head of the DINAC. Another is Colonel Americo 
Osorio, airport director, who authorized the delivery without 
even the payment of the airport duties, and Victor Arevalo as 
the professional who mediated in this shipment. The air cargo 
ramp chief is also believed to be involved. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu is furthering a 
new and aggressive foreign policy that advocates the development 
of border areas. Within this new framework, the foreign 
minister made headway in settling integration and 
complementation problems on the border with Brazil, including 
the serious pollution problem affecting common rivers, 
sanitation, and pasteurization of Brazilian milk at Conaprole 
[National Cooperative of Milk Producers] factories. With regard 
to Argentina, progress was made regarding the navigation of the 
upper reaches of the Uruguay River and the construction of 
sluice gates. 
  The intense tour that Abreu and his main aides made included 
meetings with experts from the Salto Grande Joint Commission, 
Rio Grande do Sul Governor Alceu Collares, Rubens Ricupero, the 
Brazilian minister of environment and legal Amazon Region, and 
mayors from the main border areas. 
  At the international press headquarters, the CTM 
[Argentine-Uruguayan Joint Technical Commission of Salto Grande] 
presented Abreu with the final plan to build a sluice gate -- 
which started some years ago -- to raise the Uruguay River's 
water level to the reservoir's level and thus enable upstream 
navigation. This work will facilitate the transportation of 
more than 45 million metric tons of cargo up to Argentine and 
Uruguayan ports at a considerably lower price. 
  CTM members and Abreu himself were of one mind about the 
importance of this project since it will be instrumental in 
transforming the Uruguay River in the great cargo waterway of 
the subregion -- including Brazil -- and in fostering the 
comprehensive development of a vast area of the three countries 
with the resultant improvement of its inhabitants' quality of 
life. [passage omitted] 
  The most salient aspects of the foreign minister's tour of 
the interior were perhaps his agenda in Melo, Rio Branco, and 
[the Brazilian city of] Jaguarao together with his meeting with 
Collares and Ricupero. 
  Both countries' official delegations shared the same views 
as 
the mayors, aldermen from [the Uruguayan cities of] Rivera, 
Artigas, Cerro Largo, Tacuarembo, [and the Brazilian cities of] 
Jaguarao, Bage, and Santa Vitoria. During an official ceremony 
in Rio Branco, two devices for "monitoring the environment" were 
presented to Uruguay, which will have them on loan for a year. 
These machines are to be used to "measure air particles, rain 
elements, and atmospheric changes" to reliably determine whether 
the acid rain that affects crops and vegetation in border 
departments is caused by the Candiota power plant [in Brazil]. 
  Brazilian and Uruguayan authorities were in total agreement 
about the urgent need to deepen integration along the entire 
border in order to "improve citizens' standard of living." They 
also noted that the objective that will characterize the "new 
joint policy" is to situate development centers in border areas, 
where people have always lived in brotherhood striving to 
overcome shortages caused by the centralization of power." 
[quotation marks as published] 
  Collares took pains to underscore that the governments have 
adopted a new personal and political attitude. The open and 
sincere talks, at which LA MANANA was present, serve to overcome 
some longstanding diplomatic problems and bureaucratic hurdles. 
Abreu said: "The way was paved for sincere understanding 
through direct dialogue between rulers." Collares shared 
Abreu's views and openly expressed his intention of encouraging 
the development of border areas to improve the standard of 
living and overcome "red tape" problems. 
  The delegations decided to hold a meeting in Canela during 
the second fortnight of May to finalize arrangements for common 
projects in the border areas. 
  These include: Sanitation for sister cities like Artigas- 
Quarahi, Rivera-Santa Ana do Livramento, Bella-Union, and 
Chuy-Chuy; and the cleaning up of common rivers and streams. 
With regard to the latter, both countries agreed to expedite 
the drafting of concrete projects since the IDB [Inter-American 
Development Bank] suspended the financing planned some time ago 
due to the fact that the systems in both banks do not have the 
same technical or maintenance levels. 
  A project to be implemented by Rivera and Livramento 
provides 
for the pasteurization of Brazilian milk at Conaprole's No. 14 
factory and its subsequent transportation to Brazil for local 
consumption. Both countries are making efforts so border towns 
will have common transportation and health care services. 
[passage omitted] 
  Another important subject in which both countries' 
delegations were of one mind pertains to the old bridge across 
the Jaguarao River -- a crucial point in the freeway to link Sao 
Pablo, Montevideo, and Buenos Aires -- and the development of 
the Laguna Merin basin. 
  Collares stated: "It will be impossible to foster the area's 
comprehensive development unless we have a modern bridge that 
joins both countries." A binational commission made up by 
authorities from Jaguarao and Rio Branco raised this issue and 
submitted a project for building a new bridge. This is one of 
the central issues to be thoroughly analyzed at the Canela 
meeting since, in the words of the Rio Grande do Sul governor, 
"we are determined to promote the building of a road network."

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano from "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Referring to statements made by Hilarion Cardozo, 
president of Copei [Social Christian Party], Interior Minister 
Ramon Escovar Salom said the country is not facing any serious 
disturbances. Escovar agreed that the country must make an 
effort to achieve national unity but rejected the possibility of 
de facto coups as hinted by the Copei leader. In Escovar's 
opinion, the country wants peace and trusts the current 
president. 
  [Begin Escovar recording] There is absolute normalcy 
throughout the country. There is no destabilization risk at 
this time. The people want peace and tranquility, and the 
government is willing to offer it. The initiative to reach a 
consensus and make commitments is a very important one. 
  I do not want to comment on the Copei proposal yet because 
we 
need to study it. I do want to say that any conciliation 
proposal is welcome, because the country is hungry for national 
unity. The country wants an atmosphere of national conciliation 
and understanding. [end recording] 
  Escovar also reacted to legislators' questions regarding his 
speech on state security policies. He pointed out that they 
criticized its form and not its substance. The minister also 
said he will give a more detailed explanation of this issue in 
the future. 
  Meanwhile, Federal District Governor Asdrubal Aguiar 
discussed the public security problem at Miraflores Palace. He 
said that the prompt promulgation of a social security and 
citizen safety law time is indispensable to allow the Executive 
Branch to act against crime in the cities. Aguiar admitted that 
although he was a critic of the Vagrancy Law, it is the sole 
instrument that allows him to take actions that go beyond mere 
police operations. 
  The governor added that in his meetings with the mayors 
[prefectos] of Caracas and Vargas, he recommended that this law 
be enforced without violating the right to defense and without 
committing the injustices that have been regularly committed in 
the enforcement of this law. As for the death toll in the 
metropolitan area over the weekend, Aguiar said that even though 
the figure has dropped, it is still alarming.

  [Text] In order to dispel doubts and foster confidence in 
the country, Defense Minister General Rafael Montero Reverte has 
said that with their current plans, the National Armed Forces 
[FAN] are prepared to handle any contingency that may arise in 
the nation. This was the ranking officer's response to 
statements made by Brigade General Gonzalo Vargas Ortiz, chief 
of planning and budget of the Defense Ministry, who, when asked 
by the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, replied 
that the FAN needed an overall budget because its military 
capacity was collapsing, and this influences the country's 
security. "That is one official's opinion, not the FAN's 
opinion," Montero Reverte indicated. 
  The defense minister also made comments on a report 
published 
in a Caracas daily stating a group of officers are meeting to 
discuss the country's problems and are being investigated by the 
Directorate of Military Intelligence, DIM. The minister 
indicated the Constitution, its Charter Law, and the will of all 
the military ban politics within the FAN. When we enter the 
military, we voluntarily sign a statement saying we do not want 
to be politicians or decision makers. There is not going to be 
politics in the garrisons," he added. 
  Commenting on the dismissal of charges against coupist 
officers, he said that neither the Defense Ministry, the 
Miraflores Palace, nor the military justice had stopped it. He 
denied there is a state of alert from the fear of a Colombian 
guerrilla invasion since the FAN has the plans and personnel, 
including three task forces that operate on the border and 
coordinate with the Colombian Army. He concluded by saying that 
studies are being done along the border to increase guard posts, 
and announced that the Army and the National Guard are building 
10 posts.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 22 
March. 
  Alfredo Acedo Machado, president of the Acedo Mendoza group, 
today addressed a group of Venezuelan and Colombian investors 
who met in Caracas and spoke about corporate business strategies 
and growth strategies of Venezuelan corporations. Acedo Machado 
pointed out that movements of capital in Latin America have 
grown considerably and that foreign investments in 1992 in six 
countries of the region amounted to $12.3 billion. He added 
that the main investments between 1992 and 1993 were registered 
in Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA 
ECONOMIA in Spanish 16 Mar 94 p 11) 
  Javier Gomez-Navarro, the Spanish minister of commerce and 
tourism who is visiting Caracas, announced that Spain has 
granted the greatest amount of soft credits to Venezuela, to the 
tune of $300 million. Gomez-Navarro added that he seeks to 
reestablish commercial contacts in the service and tourism 
sectors. (Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 16 Mar 94 p 23) 
  The Central Bank of Venezuela today sold bonds in the amount 
of $327 million that will mature in 91 and 182 days. The bank 
has weekly sales aimed at controlling liquidity, reducing 
pressure on the dollar exchange rate, and halting the 
advancement of inflation. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2326 GMT 16 Mar

<F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpts] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said Thursday 
[17 March] that the government's military victory over the 
guerrillas is certain. The president made this remark in Mexico 
City on the last day of his official visit during a breakfast 
with Latin American and Caribbean diplomats accredited in 
Mexico. [passage omitted] 
  De Leon attended this breakfast with the officials who 
accompanied him to Mexico, including several ministers. He said 
his government is intent on establishing true democracy and 
preserving institutions. The president assured his government 
respects human rights, but that the armed conflict represents a 
constant threat to those rights. [passage omitted] 
  The diplomats attending the breakfast showed great interest 
in De Leon's remarks. Some ambassadors posed questions at the 
end of the meeting with the Nicaraguan president; one was about 
the future dissolution or reduction of the Guatemalan Army. 
  [Begin recording] [Jose Ernesto Fonseca Pasos, Nicaraguan 
ambassador to Mexico] [Question indistinct] 
  [De Leon] The reduction in the Army in our case is not 
(?feasible) [words indistinct] in general is not possible 
because even those countries supposedly without armies have 
them. Our Constitution clearly establishes its presence and 
that there should be only one army. It does not accept any 
other armed or unconventional group. For this reason, this 
topic has no reason for being. As for the first part, the Armed 
Forces have discussed a readjustment or even a reduction. We 
are conducting a study in line with the Guatemalan Army plans 
and the conditions that will exist. To be sure, the armed 
conflict has to end to achieve that. 
  It is not possible to ask an army to shrink its size so long 
as subversion exists or an enemy exists within the country. 
Much has been said about the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols 
[PAC], and [words indistinct] that they should be disbanded. 
They are part of Guatemala's military defense. They are 
persons who have grouped together. Much has been said about the 
voluntary nature of these groups. The human rights ombudsman, 
who replaced me, recently conducted a survey, and the result was 
tremendously surprising in terms of the voluntary manner in 
which the members joined the PAC, which are currently called 
Voluntary Civil Defense Committees. 
  A lot has been said about dissolving the PAC's because of 
the 
abuses perpetrated by some of their members -- which is true, I 
admit. I am aware of this and have issued instructions to the 
effect that when such abuses are perpetrated, when PAC members 
take advantage of their position and perpetrate illegal acts or 
crimes, they must be prosecuted as would any other citizen. 
However, it would be illogical and naive to eliminate groups 
that have prevented the progress of subversion. Many groups in 
Guatemala and abroad have called for the dissolution of the 
PAC's and I have always said that such a request is the result 
of either naivete or a desire not to hinder the progress of 
subversion. 
  The PAC's have demonstrated to the entire world that it is 
possible to counteract and prevent the progress of guerrilla 
warfare, so much so that many countries are imitating them. 
Unfortunately -- and I say unfortunately because this sort of 
guerrilla warfare has also taken place in other countries -- 
they are imitating the actions of a people who, angered by their 
sufferings, their orphans, their lives, etc., have organized for 
preventive purposes. 
  An Army in Guatemala, or anywhere in the world, would find 
it 
difficult to control the progress of terrorism, but already in 
those areas where these civilian groups have organized they have 
unquestionably contributed militarily to the defense effort and 
have prevented the progress of subversion. This is why, 
militarily speaking, the war against subversion has been won. 
The subversives have been militarily defeated. I would like to 
add, although the minister of defense will discuss this in 
greater detail, that we have already decided to establish PAC's 
in areas that are free of subversion. Two-thirds of our 
nation's territory is free of subversives and there are no PAC's 
in the remaining third. [sentence as heard] Therefore, the 
PAC's have gradually become committees of peace and development, 
they are very well organized and in the future could prove very 
advantageous, no longer with weapons but for the economic and 
social development of their communities. I would like the 
defense minister to expand on this issue. 
  [Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez] [passage omitted] 
Concerning the dissolution, reduction, reorganization or 
retraining of the Army, I have certain views, Messrs. 
ambassadors, regarding the manner in which the Guatemalan Army 
should be reorganized once we have overcome the insurgent 
threat, and a bill to this effect will be presented to the 
president. The constitutional president of the Republic has 
already ordered the implementation of many of these actions, and 
besides fulfilling a constitutional mission, I believe this 
reorganization will allow for (?relocations) and the 
strengthening of certain areas, such as [words indistinct], 
which will be protected in a more effective manner and the Army 
will be able to exchange quantity for quality. 
  These plans are already under way and include the 
educational 
systems at our military academy and our university or military 
training center. No one will be able to graduate as an officer 
unless he follows the curriculum [words indistinct] of a liberal 
education. No one will be able to take an (?advanced) course, 
let alone the General Staff course, if he does not have a 
bachelors or masters degree in any of the liberal arts. 
  This plan, gentlemen, is already under way. However, this 
education system will also be extended to specialists and 
soldiers because our plan is to reduce time in service, to make 
military service truly voluntary, and to thereby preclude 
complaints. I am aware that at this time many of our plans for 
the Army bear the heavy burden of [word indistinct] and 
depoliticization, but this is because there is still an armed 
conflict in Guatemala. However, we have planned numerous 
improvements which include, pardon the repetition, an exchange 
of quantity for quality within the Guatemalan Army, which the 
president is aware of and which, moreover, he has approved. I 
will not speak any further because I do not want to take up any 
more of the president's time. Thank you very much. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Defense Minister General Rene Enriquez Morales, in 
disclosing the results of his trip to Mexico, mentioned the 
possibility that Central American guerrillas -- among them the 
URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] -- could be 
involved in the Zapatist guerrilla rebellion in Mexico. Enriquez 
Morales, who was part of the presidential entourage, said the 
possibility that the URNG supports the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army (EZLN) has not been ruled out. According to what 
was said in Mexico, other movements with similar tendencies also 
advise the EZLN. 
  The general added that it is no secret that the URNG used 
Mexican territory as its sanctuary and he pointed out a 
guerrilla arsenal had been discovered in Mexico, which was later 
identified as belonging to the URNG. Enriquez Morales added: We 
do not have hard evidence that the URNG participated in the 
conflict. Nevertheless, according to conversations with the 
Mexican defense secretary, when the issue was discussed, this 
possibility has not been ruled out. 
  Border security problems were also discussed, and in this 
case, Mexican authorities expressed their willingness to 
cooperate with Guatemala to set up immigration controls and 
security on the almost 1,000 km Mexican border. The general 
added that this issue was given top priority because there is 
still a rebel presence in the border areas which facilitates the 
smuggling of fine wood from the Peten forrests. Mexican 
cooperation would involve establishing customs and immigration 
posts to protect the southern border, particularly because of 
the importance this has in context with NAFTA.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 22 Mar (DPA) -- Guatemalan President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio made changes to his security cabinet in an 
attempt to resolve the high crime rate existing in the country, 
which consists of cases of theft, assaults, kidnappings, and 
other criminal activities. 
  The new government (interior) minister [El nuevo ministro de 
gobernacion interior] is Danilo Parinello, a former Constituent 
Assembly deputy, who said he accepted the post (considered to be 
the most difficult in the cabinet) because of his friendship 
with President Ramiro de Leon Carpio. He added that even though 
he has no experience in the area of security he will carry out 
the best possible actions. He announced the creation of an 
immediate reaction group to take care of emergencies that may 
appear. 
  Colonel Mario Alfredo Merida was appointed the new deputy 
government minister. He has experience in military 
intelligence. Former Justice of the Peace Salvador Figueroa was 
appointed police director. 
  The high crime rate is one of the leading problems 
confronting the government of Ramiro de Leon Carpio. Some 
sectors have pointed out that unemployment and extreme poverty 
suffered by the majority of the population are some of the 
reasons for the high crime rate.

Gonzalez as the new government vice minister. 
  The government also announced the removal of Mario Rene 
Cifuentes Echeverria as general director of the National Police. 
Salvador Figueroa, who took his oath of office before Minister 
Parinello, replaces Cifuentes. 
  In an interview with reporters, the minister admitted he was 
lacking experience in public security, but he said he is 
assuming his post with the greatest commitment to fighting 
crime. He also noted that there is close friendship between him 
and the president. 
<H5>  Contents of Emergency Plan </H5>
  The emergency plan announced last night comprises six 
phases, 
all of which will be implemented in the near future. The first 
is the Holy Week Plan, which is designed to provide security 
during Holy Week and Easter festivities in urban areas and along 
highways. A large number of policemen have been assigned to 
this task. 
  Another phase is the creation of an Immediate Reaction Team 
that will include a specialized 300-man mobile force trained in 
fighting crime head-on. A new investigative and seizure unit 
also will begin operations. 
  The plan includes cataloguing and repairing internal police 
radio communications equipment. Meanwhile, Phase 6 deals with 
police force vehicles, all of which will be dedicated to civil 
order patrols. 
  The plan, according to Parinello Blanco, will be launched 
immediately. The Immediate Reaction Team will not be a 
repressive force, but a preventive force. We will aggressively 
crack down on crime wherever it occurs.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 21 Mar (ACAN -- EFE) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro De Leon Carpio said here today that the 
Salvadoran general elections strengthen the democratic process 
in that country and in Central America. 
  Despite the results, "is it a step forward in the 
consolidation of democracy. The political participation of 
those who were in the mountains is an example for the world," 
the chief of state added. 
  "The mere fact that they held elections without a war is a 
great step forward," the president told reporters at the 
presidential palace. 
  Alfonso Cabrera, secretary general of Guatemalan Christian 
Democracy [DCG], told ACAN that the elections represent one 
achievement of current President Alfredo Cristiani in the 
triumph of democracy. 
  "Now it is the political parties' responsibility to ensure 
the welfare of the people and to consolidate democracy," the 
political leader said. Cabrera believes ARENA will win if there 
is a runoff election. 
  Sidney Shaw, leader of the Union of the National Center, 
told 
ACAN that his party is pleased that 50 percent of the people 
voted and that this is a sure path toward peace. 
  "The sad thing is that we are still at war in Guatemala, but 
hopefully in the next elections (1995) we will have the 
guerrillas registered as a political party," he stated. 
  Shaw said that if there is a runoff election in El Salvador, 
there is a possibility that the leftist coalition headed by the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) may win, 
because the DCG could offer to support it. 
  He noted, however, that ARENA is strong and might obtain 
favorable results.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 22 
March. 
  Deputy Economy Minister Irma Toledo said on 10 March that, 
based on a study by the Finance Ministry, the government would 
have to allocate 700 million additional quetzales in 1994 to 
grant public employees the 300 quetzales salary increase they 
are demanding. Toledo stressed that: "Public employees have 
been told that it is impossible to meet their demands because to 
do so would mean setting aside social investments, which the 
government is not willing to do." (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE 
in Spanish 11 Mar 94 p 94) 
  An official source said today that the Guatemalan monetary 
authorities agreed to make the exchange system more flexible by 
liberalizing the public sale of foreign exchange, which is 
regulated by the Central Bank. Willy Zapata, president of the 
Guatemalan Central Bank and the Monetary Board, indicated that 
the new measure will go into effect on 17 March. Zapata 
rejected the possibility that the measure will trigger an 
increase in the exchange rate or a flight of foreign currency.

  [Text] La Paz, 9 Mar (LOS TIEMPOS) -- The U.S. agents who 
work for the DEA and some Bolivian police officers are working 
in coordination with drug-trafficking groups that operate in the 
country "to extort small drug traffickers and cocaine growers," 
according to retired Captain Jaime Paredes Sempertegui. 
  Capt. Paredes, who retired from the Navy a few years ago, 
became known for his public charges of corruption in the Navy 
when he presented Congress copies of videos on connections 
between political leaders and drug traffickers. He confirmed 
that "the DEA works with drug traffickers outside U.S. and 
Bolivian laws." 
  "I say it, I confirm it, and I can prove it" said Paredes 
Sempertegui, a MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] member who is 
currently as adviser to the Chamber of Deputies Defense 
Committee, in asserting that DEA agents and Bolivian policemen 
carry out "their well-known extortion operations." 
  He said the criminal acts "are made in the so-called 
security 
houses located all over the national territory. These acts are 
known by the public. For example, in Santa Cruz I would like to 
point out the house of a Bolivian Navy member rented for that 
purpose. It is the house of Colonel Alberto Latelier Ortiz." 
  Paredes explained that his charges refer to specific people 
and facts that in no way compromise national institutions, for 
which he said he has respect and consideration, mentioning the 
Armed Forces and National Police primarily. 
  He said the investigation announced on this case by 
legislative committees will certainly confirm his charges and 
will clarify the real operation of the "security houses," which 
are completely outside the country's legal order.

  [Excerpt] Chamber of Deputies Vice President Alfonso 
Ferrufino said yesterday that the use of violence as a method to 
fight the illegal drug trade has failed and now the United 
States must leave Bolivia alone to design its own antinarcotics 
strategy. 
  In the midst of growing tension in coca producing areas, 
legislators have again questioned official antinarcotics 
policies that emphasize repression as the main tool to fight 
trafficking. This is being blamed for the tension in Chapare. 
  "The results speak for themselves. The volumes of drugs 
introduced into the United States have increased and consumption 
has expanded during the years these policies have been in 
effect. This reality has forced Bill Clinton's administration 
to conclude that the drug problem in their country is a problem 
of education and health," Ferrufino said. 
  The legislator recognized that surplus coca plantations are 
linked to poverty and unemployment. The peasants have seen in 
that crop their only possibility for survival at a time of 
growing unemployment. 
  "If the United Nations understood and accepted the U.S. 
installation of radars to control the entry of drugs in its 
territory, why would the United States not accept that Bolivia 
wants to seek its own solution to the problem instead of 
continuing to implement a failure?" Ferrufino said. [passage

  [Excerpt] Following the discovery and destruction of the 
largest drug laboratory yet found in Eastern Bolivia, the 
government has confirmed the existence of facilities to process 
cocaine sulphate into cocaine hydrochloride in Bolivia. 
  Operation "Aguardiente" was carried out by personnel of the 
Special Antinarcotics Force in Eastern Bolivia last weekend, 
with the support of the DEA. This led to the discovery of a 
laboratory where the drug was transformed into highly pure 
cocaine -- which had not been previously observed in Bolivia. 
  Cocaine sulfate or cocaine base paste is normally shipped in 
a wet pack to Colombia where it was refined. 
  National Defense Secretary Mario Soliz and Prosecutor 
Fernando Ugarte held a new conference at which they confirmed 
that the 18 individuals arrested, among which are four 
Colombians, worked directly with the Cali Cartel of Colombia. 
  One of the arrested individuals said the head of the cartel 
is Pacho Herrera, currently sought internationally by antidrug 
forces. 
  The laboratory was equipped with weapons, radio equipment, 
and everything needed to manufacture cocaine. The police even 
found a pump to bring water from the river to the camp, fans to 
dry the drugs, and a hydraulic press to pack the cocaine prior 
to shipping. 
  The drug was transported to Colombia, via Brazil, from where 
it was shipped to several parts of Europe, especially The 
Netherlands. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On 8 March, Government Minister German Quiroga 
rejected the position adopted by coca producer leaders, who 
demand the suspension of antidrug operations in Chapare to 
eradicate the coca plantations prior to the long-awaited 
negotiations. 
  Explaining the recent confrontations in Chapare between coca 
producers and antidrug forces to the Senate Antinarcotic 
Struggle Committee, the minister flatly maintained that actions 
by the Mobile Police Units for Rural Areas (Umopar) in the 
tropical region seek to control traffickers, not coca producers. 
  Quiroga stated that the actions in Chapare will continue 
despite opposition by coca producers. 
  Regarding demands by coca producers leaders to sit down and 
talk with the government, Quiroga said he agreed to suspend the 
forced eradication of coca because "at this time no leader is 
under arrest." 
  "Wherever we find a maceration pit or a cocaine laboratory 
we 
will destroy it," he said. 
  He indicated that the government is awaiting a call from the 
Bolivian Labor Federation, which is mediating in the 
negotiations, to proceed with a meeting between the coca 
producers and government that is scheduled for today. 
  He stated that the government wants to reach agreement with 
the producers, without implying any loss for the campesinos, and 
wants to stop the supply of precursors to the traffickers. 
  He noted that the results of the fight against trafficking 
is 
reflected in the price paid for a drum of coca leaf: On 1 
February 1994 a drum cost 270 bolivianos, today it costs just 90 
bolivianos.

  [Text] The government and coca farmers failed yesterday to 
reach an agreement that will pacify the coca producing zones in 
El Chapare region of Cochabamba Department. 
  Following long meetings, the peasant leaders decided to 
withdraw from talks with the cabinet members. They said the 
ministers broke the preliminary agreement reached on 9 March. 
  The article that caused the breaking of relations sought to 
make the coca leaders promise to engage in voluntary eradication 
of plantations "without interference" from the peasants. 
  Until dawn on 10 March, considerable progress was made 
toward 
overcoming the atmosphere of violence that prevailed since 5 
March when officials from the Coca Eradication Directorate 
(Direco) and members of the Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas 
clashed with 4,000 coca farmers in the Chapare. 
  Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar and Minister of the 
Government German Quiroga, as well as coca peasant leader Evo 
Morales and COB [Bolivian Labor Federation] leader Oscar Salas, 
said yesterday that there are implicit threats to use violence 
again in the tropical Chapare region. 
  Government and union leaders blamed each other for breaking 
the agreement, which the public considered a positive step 
toward an atmosphere of peace in the agitated central region of 
Bolivia. 
  "The government will ensure that the law is respected," 
Minister Quiroga told journalists after meeting with President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada. 
  Minister Aranibar expressed "the government's disenchantment 
and frustration at the result of the conversations." He said 
the issue "was handled with full respect for the political will 
to resolve the problems within an atmosphere dialogue, 
understanding, and the spirit of Law No. 1008." He said that 
the opposition of some coca leaders to the control of excess 
coca crops is just as unacceptable as when organizations like 
the JIFE [International Council of Narcotics Control] suggest a 
ban on the consumption of coca leaves.

  [Text] Religious leader Lucius Walker was recently released 
by police in Laredo after having been arrested together with 
Cuban-Canadian Camilo Garcia while they were trying to transport 
equipment across the border for Cuba. 
  Prior to Walker and Garcia's arrest, several members of the 
third U.S.-Cuba friendship caravan crossed the U.S.-Mexican 
border with a satellite communication system and several other 
electronic supplies. (Errol Edwards), coordinator of Pastors for 
Peace, stated that the significance of the event was not the 
fact of having transported the equipment from the United States 
to Mexico, but that it represented the weakening of the U.S. 
blockade against Cuba. 
  The members of the caravan, headed by Walker, returned to 
Laredo from Havana where they handed the Martin Luther King, 
Jr., Memorial Center a donation of more than 140 tons of 
humanitarian aid collected in more than 100 U.S., Canadian, and 
Mexican cities.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with reporter Rey Rodriguez from Hanoi </F>
by reporter Roberto Cavada from Havana -- live] 
  [Text] [Cavada] We now have a live and direct link with 
Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, where Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina has many activities scheduled. Good morning from 
Havana, Rey. 
  [Rodriguez] Good morning Cavada, and good morning to all 
your 
Radio Rebelde listeners. 
  [Cavada] Well, according to PRENSA LATINA, I understand that 
the Cuban foreign minister has a heavy agenda there and that he 
also met with the Vietnamese Communist Party [VCP] first 
secretary. What is the story about this and what other details 
can you tell the Cuban people? 
  [Rodriguez] Well, I have a very few minutes to tell you all 
about the foreign minister's acitivities today, that is, on his 
second day in Hanoi, capital of Vietnam. But as you said, only 
a few minutes ago the Cuban foreign minister was received by VCP 
General Secretary Do Muoi. This meeting, which was termed by 
Robaina as very fruitful, lasted almost two hours. Do Muoi 
expressed interest in the Cuban foreign minister's visit to 
seven Asian countries which in addition to Vietnam, includes 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, India, and Myanmar [Burma]. 
  Robaina explained to the VCP leader that the objective of 
his 
tour of these Asian countries is to explain what we are doing in 
our country and to listen to many points of view as part of an 
offensive being carried out by the Cuban Foreign Ministry. This 
offensive began in the Caribbean, then continued in Latin 
America and Africa, and now in Asia. 
  During this meeting Robaina handed over to Do Muoi a message 
by Commander in Chief Fidel Castro which conveys the feelings of 
[word indistinct] for what the Vietnamese people are doing. Do 
Muoi said he is convinced that current difficulties affecting 
the island are transitory and that the Cubans will know how to 
overcome them. He added that we must be very careful in taking 
the right path in this renewal process, especially the one being 
carried out by Vietnam, because there are many detours from the 
correct path that can jeopardize the sovereignty and 
independence of the two countries. He added that in times like 
this, the party's ideological nature must be strengthened to 
keep it united and sound. 
  Well, the Cuban foreign minister had previously held several 
meetings with the ministers of commerce and agriculture, with 
the chairman of the State Committee for Cooperation and 
Investments, and in all these meetings both parties have 
expressed their interest in strengthening commercial ties in 
areas such as biotechnology, construction, agriculture, and 
maritime transportation. As I was saying, the importance of 
creating joint ventures was stressed, especially in the areas of 
construction and of veterinary pharmaceuticals. 
  I also want to tell you that Robaina held a meeting with 
members of political and grassroot organizations here in 
Vietnam. During those meetings we obtained an exclusive 
interview granted to Rebelde by Ho Duc Viet, secretary of the Ho 
Chi Minh Communist Youth Union. 
  [Begin Ho Duc Viet recording in Vietnamese with simultaneous 
translation into Spanish] We are organizing a campaign for a 
contribution of 5 million [currency not specified] worth of 
school supplies for the Cuban children. Practically all people 
have responded favorably to this campaign. In the beginning we 
organized this campaign among the youth alone, but then we 
extended it to the country's overall population, including the 
women, the aged, and state organizations. The campaign has 
already concluded. We collected more than $500,000, and all that 
money will be used to purchase notebooks, pencils, and other 
school utensils for children. We are now waiting for a ship to 
transfer these supplies to Cuba. [end recording] 
  Tomorrow the Cuban foreign minister will grant a news 
conference. Present at the news conference will also be the 
diplomatic corps accredited to Vietnam. Then Robaina will leave 
for the southern part of Vietnam, namely to Ho Chi Minh City 
where he will have an intensive working schedule, including a 
meeting with the provincial party first secretary. He will also 
visit the special industrial processing zone developed in 
cooperation with Taiwan. Robaina today also met with the 
minister of youth and sports, with the chief of the VCP Central 
Committee International Relations Commission. He indeed had an 
intensive working schedule, but in all these meetings the 
friendship and love between these two peoples have prevailed, in 
addition to their traditional ties of friendship. 
  Thank you, Cavada, and greetings to all listeners of 
Rebelde. 
  [Cavada] Thank you Rey for these expanded details of the 
Cuban foreign minister's activities in Vietnam.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina today said in 
Hanoi that Vietnam is a nation of daring people and that within 
that virtue the children are also capable of challenging the 
U.S. economic, financial, and trade blockade against Cuba. 
  Robaina is paying an official visit to Vietnam during which 
he met with several Vietnamese officials, including Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam. 
  In a solemn ceremony at the fatherland's building, Robaina 
handed over awards to the three children winners of the "On the 
Way to Cuba" contest sponsored by the Vietnamese Pioneers 
organization. 
  Robaina said that together with the tremendous material 
value 
of the rice and school supplies donated by the Vietnamese people 
to Cuba, this Asian country is an endless source of incentive 
with its work and spirit of sacrifice.

  [Text] Le Van Triet, Vietnamese minister of commerce and 
tourism, reiterated his country's promise to send 100,000 tons 
of rice during 1994 as part of a cooperation agreement and 
mercantile exchange between the two countries. During a meeting 
with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, the Vietnamese 
minister was optimistic as to the renewal process of the Cuban 
economy and underscored that his country understands the 
importance of maintaining the trade agreement. 
  Robaina also met with Nguyen Cong Tan, minister of 
agriculture and food industry. Both sides expressed their 
satisfaction with the growing atmosphere of mutually beneficial 
cooperation between the two countries. Nguyen Cong Tan came out 
in favor of boosting cooperation not only in agriculture but 
also in, among other spheres, construction, health, education, 
science, biotechnology, and maritime transport. 
  Robaina also met with (Nguyen May), vice chairman of the 
State Commission for Cooperation and Investment, who came out in 
favor of joint enterprises in construction and other areas 
before exploring other fields. 
  Roberto Robaina met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet. He also held talks with his counterpart, Nguyen Manh Cam. 
Robaina's agenda includes a meeting with the general secretary 
of the Vietnamese Communist Party and a news conference to wind

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Carlos Santana Ojeda and </F>
guests Eloy Concepcion and Renato Recio from TRABAJADORES 
newspaper -- live] 
  [Text] [Santana] Everyone knows that the Cuban cattle 
industry is undergoing one of its most critical periods. Why is 
this? 
  [Concepcion] I would not say most critical. I believe that 
the cattle industry is beginning to emerge from its most 
critical period. The main problem with the cattle was feed. We 
had developed a cattle industry in Cuba based on a breed that 
required mainly hay -- Holstein, primarily a dairy breed. 
  [Santana] And this hay was imported. 
  [Concepcion] It was imported. When this stopped, the cattle 
naturally experienced the results of a lack of feed. This is the 
reason I said it is not that the industry is undergoing a 
crisis, but overcoming a crisis. I know that strong, nationwide 
efforts began last year regarding cattle feed. There are signs 
in Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and certain farms in Havana, 
Camaguey, and Pinar del Rio that show the beginning of a 
significant recovery in the Cuban cattle industry. 
  [Recio] I would like to give my opinion about what Eloy said 
regarding the word crisis. What he is saying is true: The worst 
part of the crisis is over. The worst part of a crisis is the 
period of decline toward the bottom of the abyss -- to employ a 
metaphor. The Cuban cattle industry has apparently halted its 
decline. However, it stopped at a very low level. I believe we 
have to stress this. The decline has stopped, but at a very low 
level. We can affirm that the Cuban cattle industry is 
undergoing a very, very critical period. 
  I will give you some points in case: The mass of Cuban 
cattle 
is extremely inferior to the ideal in any country. Cuba ought to 
have a cattle population proportional to its human population. 
We are far from having cattle proportional to our population. 
Any dairy production should produce a liter-per-cow rate 
of....[pauses] A poor quality breed should yield six liters a 
day and a highly efficient breed ought to yield 12, 15, or 20. 
Right now, our averages are lower than that of the worst of the 
cattle industries. 
  However, as Eloy said, it is true that we had dipped even 
lower and that in the past few months the process has stabilized 
and shown a gradual improvement. 
  [Santana] What defines this? 
  [Recio] Renato is partially correct. When I said that we are 
emerging from the crisis I was referring to the following: I 
believe that the first crisis we experienced in this industry 
was a subjective crisis on the part of the ranchers and cadres 
who manage it, in not understanding in time, nor taking measures 
in time to find alternative feeds that might not represent the 
full nutritional potential of hay but would still have avoided a 
further decline and complete destruction of the cattle industry. 
  For example: If you have no hay, are you going to sit on 
your 
hands and wait until the animal dies, or plant sugarcane, king 
grass, or protein banks and do everything possible to keep that 
animal alive? This is why I said that I believe the crisis is 
behind us. I believe that now in the cattle sector, most 
comrades, managers, ranchers, and dairy workers have a higher 
awareness. 
  The drop in the cattle population, which resulted in 
tremendous death figures in previous years, is this year 
experiencing a slight reduction -- although not yet total. In 
other words, we see a certain recovery of the cattle; births are 
higher than deaths and more cows are becoming productive every 
day. More cows are in gestation. The previous decline in the 
cattle even lowered gestation because the severe malnutrition 
prevented cows' coming into heat. 
  From an optimistic point of view, yes, a recovery is taking 
place. There is a generalization of new methods. I want to 
stress this issue of methodology -- the technology of 
production. We have to keep in mind that wanting and getting are 
not overnight things. We have to generalize technologies. Eloy 
mentioned that a country where cattle workers used to produce 
milk from a fine breed which required highly specialized 
veterinary care and high-protein feed based on concentrates and 
where grazing was not customary suddenly was forced by 
circumstances to change methods. It has helped tremendously to 
have the experience with the famous Voisin method, which we are 
trying to generalize nationwide in an updated form. There is not 
doubt that this technology is being generalized. 
  I want to introduce another issue because the Cuban people 
should be well informed about this. We not only have to change 
production technology. We also have to make genetic changes in 
the Cuban cattle. 
  [Concepcion] There is the example of the Nazareno 
enterprise. 
  [Recio] Eloy and I visited that enterprise recently here in 
Havana. This enterprise has a great responsibility because it is 
charged with the genetic reshaping of the Cuban cattle, from 
primarily Holstein to Siboney. This is the result of a cross 
between the high milk production of the Holstein and the 
endurance and hardiness of the Zebu, which over many decades 
proved its efficiency in Cuba. 
  [Santana] You mention that there is a cattle recovery. What 
supports this? There is no milk. Milk is still rationed. I do 
not see the results and the people are saying the same thing. 
  [Concepcion] There is another reason for the shortage of 
milk. We used to import powdered milk through favorable-term 
accords with former socialist countries, specifically, Germany. 
That is the first thing. The second factor is that our own 
cattle herd, primarily Holsteins fed on hay, was a great milk 
producer. Milk supplies were higher than today. We imported 
approximately 20,000 or 30,000 tons of hay. We no longer have 
the capability to import that feed to produce milk. We have a 
very large Holstein cattle population that could yield higher 
levels of milk if we had hay. 
  [Recio] I also want to discuss two elements I believe we 
should address in this program since we are talking straight. 
First, I believe that increased worker welfare has also 
contributed significantly to this recovery. You mentioned the 
visit to the Nazareno enterprise. We also visited the Valle de 
Peru enterprise. At this services complex we saw how they have 
been building work tools for the ranchers, and how houses have 
been built at the ranches. 
  The other element is cattle theft and slaughter. This is 
truly a serious problem in many places, one that has 
significantly hurt our herds. It is an element we have to keep 
in mind. It is a situation that still has not been solved in any 
province, except in some specific cases. This is seriously 
hurting our cattle. 
  [Santana] You know that much has been said lately about the 
Voisin Rational Grazing System. As a matter of fact, this is a 
cattle method dating back to the sixties. Is this a valid 
technology for these times? 
  [Concepcion] Completely valid. We can add that it was so 
previously, from a purely technological point of view. What 
happened is that we lived in a world where we had certain ties 
with certain countries and blocs of countries and the economy 
imposed certain rules. We got hay and concentrates relatively 
easily. If under good conditions a Holstein gives over 22 
liters, it makes no sense to graze. It apparently makes no 
sense; we cannot be absolute here. 
  The main point of the Voisin method, as updated, lies in the 
fact that Cuba is a tropical country, a country with a fertile 
climate, a country which can produce sufficient pasture to 
support, with modern, adequate technology, a considerable cattle 
population without imported feed and concentrates and which can 
attain higher production. What supports this? Not the people's 
having more milk. We have to keep in mind that milk imports were 
halted and we experienced a significant production drop of 
approximately 50 percent. This is not easy to restore. 
  [Recio] Yes. We cannot hope to restore that. This is one of 
the most difficult recovery process any country can experience. 
It takes three years for a calf to become productive. Certain 
things are being done. One supporting factor is the minidairy 
farms. We have also to implement technological changes in the 
minidairies and gradually eliminate those large enterprises 
which do not correspond to today's reality with cattle. 
  [Santana] We have spoken of subjective problems. However, 
are 
our cattle workers truly efficient? 
  [Concepcion] I do not believe they are efficient enough, 
yet. 
I believe that once again a body of cattle workers is taking 
shape with this new mentality, or need the country has, to use 
the Voisin method, to handle cattle properly, and to house the 
cattle workers at the ranches. This is why it is important to 
locate homes near the workplace, so that the workers can live 
there and care for those cattle. It is also important to promote 
workers' welfare and self- sufficiency, promote pig and chicken 
farming so that the entire family is available to take care of 
the facility. I believe that this is the type of thing that will 
solve this problem.

  [Text] Cienfuegos youths have held their fishing sector 
discussion as part of the continuing Sixth Congress of the UJC 
[Union of Young Communists]. The young people of the fishing 
sector, representing the nation's different provinces, held the 
sector discussion in Cienfuegos Province. 
  Such important topics as achieving greater efficiency and 
productivity, taking better care of the work force, increasing 
the movement of innovators and efficiency experts, and 
confronting criminal actions took up the greatest part of the 
session. During their speeches, the delegates pointed out the 
way Cuba's young people are at the center of the nation's 
problems and discussed the initiatives they are undertaking. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] I don't need to tell 
you that there has been a tremendous deterioration in the work 
force because of this crime problem. In the past three years, we 
have lost approximately 1,000 people, because of all these 
things -- as many captains [patrones] as crew [lancheros] and 
baiters [encarnadores]. I mean, it is really quite serious. And 
we who need the support of the comrades from the [word 
indistinct] of the ministry and the comrades who are involved 
with these things... [pauses] We have followed up with the 
comrades from the UJC's national bureau and the provincial UJC 
bureau to try to recruit 80 young people to the center. The UJC 
immediately moved forward on the task. We have the 80 youths for 
the center, but well, a bit... [pauses] the entry of these new 
young people into the center has, as we say in proper Cuban, 
stalled [se ha trabado]. [end recording] 
  Also analyzed at this fishing sector discussion was the 
progress of fish farming in the country -- the possibilities 
that exist with a reservoir capacity of 9 million cubic meters 
of water in Cuba, in addition to all the infrastructure that has 
been created to produce fry. Nevertheless, there is still quite 
a way to go before some 40,000 tons of fish a year can be 
produced to supply the population. The main difficulties lie in 
the lack of a work force, and its instability. 
  The plenum resolved to create a new generation of fishermen 
as was done in the first years of the Revolution. The residents 
of Cienfuegos expressed their experience in this task, and 
fundamentally in developing family fish farming.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Luis Sexto] </F>
  [Text] For almost three months and up to a few days ago, 
the country witnessed an uninterrupted discussion. More than 
80,000 meetings turned thousands of workplaces into 
miniparliaments, with the workers discussing matters that have 
been discussed in the past, and are to be discussed again, by 
the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP]. But 
this was not a useless process. It has served essentially to 
give Cubans an awareness of the nature of national problems and 
of the alternatives for solving them gradually. 
  In a society ruled by overwhelming consensus, it is 
impossible to adopt measures that could in one way or another 
affect the economy without first consulting public opinion. 
  To save time, some might have recommended the use of the 
government's prerogatives. In other countries in the world, 
levying a tax or raising a price is not discussed with anyone. 
It is a quick and unexpected blow. In Cuba, however, the 
strength of the Revolution and of its regime lies in the 
principle that force must not be used against the people. The 
Revolution's strength comes from the people. 
  And never before has the Revolution so greatly needed the 
support of the people and the workers. Because of this 
unquestionable fact, everything discussed during the so-called 
parliaments in the workplace has to be turned into a platform 
for behavior, a guide for action in each workplace throughout 
the country. 
  Work is the lever that will boost our depressed economy. It 
is true that work requires material resources; that work 
requires a reduction in the flow of currency; and that the 
budget deficit must be reduced. These are unavoidable measures. 
Above all, however, work demands the conscientious participation 
of all workers. 
  A society that belongs to all of us and is governed by all 
of 
us requires that we join in the work effort despite the lack of 
resources, notwithstanding the lack of incentives and despite 
the lack of basic goods. Work is the guarantee that will ensure 
that what is lacking today will not be lacking tomorrow. A work 
ethic is essential. We are living through difficult times, and 
these difficult times demand a work ethic even more urgently. 
  Until the ANPP decides on the appropriate fiscal measures, 
each work center must be a parliament, and the workers must 
continue working like members of a parliament, fighting the 
bureaucratic mentality that impairs initiatives and gives rise 
to passivity, fighting everything that prevents the country from 
readjusting its economy through an entrepreneurial system that 
promotes efficiency. All this must be done today, and right now.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 17 and 22 March. 
  Radio Reloj at 3052 GMT on 17 March reports that a tourist 
installation, the (Villa Don Lino) on the north coast in Rafael 
Freyre Municipality, Holguin Province, has already met its plan 
to bring in $450,000 in hard currency, 1.5 months before the end 
of the season. The manager said there are agreements with 
Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, and Canada that will allow 
the installation to continue receiving tourists from those 
countries during the month of April. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 18 March reports that Mario 
Medero, director of the 10 de Octubre Power Plant in Nuevitas, 
described as extraordinary the efforts of plant workers to find 
solutions to problems and increase efficiency. Last week, 
workers worked 14-hour shifts to solve problems in the plant, 
and Unit No. 3 is being repaired to increase its productivity. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 18 March reports that 21,000 
caballerias of planted sugarcane fields were hand weeded during 
the first two months of the year: 8,000 caballerias in January 
and 12,000 caballerias in February. The objective for this month 
is to equal or surpass the record achieved during the same month 
in 1980 when approximately 20,000 caballerias of cane fields 
were weeded. 
  Radio Reloj at 2034 GMT on 18 March reports that the 1993-94 
potato harvest in Matanzas is going well. The province's 
agricultural organizations are expected to surpass 300,000 
quintals by 19 March. The harvest is scheduled to continue until 
mid-April in the 145 caballerias planted in potatoes for 
consumption. 
  Radio Reloj at 2057 GMT on 18 March reports that Matanzas 
Province has a second millionaire mechanized canecutting brigade 
among the National Association of Small Farmers (ANAP) forces. 
This second millionaire brigade is from the 19 de Abril 
Cooperative in Perico Municipality. ANAP has 40 mechanized 
canecutting groups. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 19 March reports that Carlos 
Martinez Salsamendi, president of the Cuban Chamber of Commerce, 
and Javier Taverna, president of the Chamber of Commerce of 
Navarra Province, Spain, have signed in Havana an agreement for 
the exchange of publications of the two chambers of commerce; 
exchange of scientific-technical, commercial, and economic 
information; courses; symposia; and technical support -- as well 
as cooperation in projects for building buses and in the graphic 
arts industry. 
  In the same newscast it is reported that under a joint 
management agreement between the Spanish corporation Hoteles de 
Espana and Cubanacan, the Camaguey Hotel in the city of Camaguey 
will join the Hoteles de Espana chain on 1 April. Installations 
in Sancti Spiritus and Holguin will also be operated under that 
system. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 19 
March 
report the following: 
  The potato harvest has begun in Sancti Spiritus Province, 
which "planted close to 40 caballerias" in potatoes this time. 
Because better quality seed was planted this year and crops were 
tended better, the province expects to harvest more potatoes 
than last year despite the fact that a smaller area was planted. 
  On 18 March, the provincial bureau of the Communist Party of 
Cuba in Pinar del Rio Province called for an intensification of 
effort in the tobacco harvest, "a campaign that is becoming 
tough because the planting plan has not been met, yet the aim of 
arriving at the number of quintals promised for this year is 
being maintained." Over 50 percent of the 1,809 caballerias 
planted in tobacco in Pinar del Rio is still unharvested; and at 
the present time, 411 caballerias are behind as regards 
different kinds of tending. The availability of electrical 
energy to dry blond tobacco has improved in the last few days. 
  The workers of the Jose Antonio Echeverria Contingent are 
working intensely in order to finish the isotopes center -- the 
only one of its kind in Cuba -- this year. The center, located 
on the border of Guanabacoa and San Jose de las Lajas 
Munipality, will research and produce compounds for use in 
nuclear medicine. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1255 on 19 March reports that the Spanish 
firm (Hoteles C) reached an agreement with the National 
Institute for Tourism to manage and market the Camaguey Hotel in 
Camaguey, the (Pernec) Hotel in Holguin, and the caves of Sancti 
Spiritus. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 19 March reports that Cuba and 
Venezuela are negotiating an agreement having to do with the 
specialty of ecological tourism. 
  Radio Reloj at 2047 GMT on 21 March reports that a group of 
65 Uruguayan municipal-level unionists visiting Cuba donated a 
shipment of medicines and school supplies on 21 March. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 21 March reports that a 
new cane Basic Cooperative Production Unit, La Polka, has been 
formed in Santa Cruz del Sur Municipality, Camaguey Province, 
and is showing excellent results. Close to 200 caballerias of 
cane were planted in Cienfuegos Province during January and 
February. Cienfuegos' cane planting plan for January-June calls 
for planting 1,000 caballerias and weeding all the fields 
planted. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 22 
March 
report that "thanks to Cubanacan S.A., Cuba has an international 
sky-diving center that guarantees that any international quality 
event can be held here." The center is located in Varadero and 
possesses the latest technology and constitutes a very 
attractive hub in every way. "At the official inauguration, a 
group of athletes from western Cuba performed sky-diving 
demonstrations. At the end of this month, 50 Brazilians will be 
diving as part of their preparations for the Latin American 
championship."

  [Text] Toward the end of last week, the expanded military 
council of the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces 
[Minfar] held an assessment meeting where it evaluated the 
performance of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] during 1993. 
The meeting was chaired by Raul Castro Ruz, second secretary of 
the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] and Minister of the FAR. The 
meeting concluded with a solemn and moving ceremony to promote 
Enrique Carreras Rolas, a hero of the Republic of Cuba, to the 
rank of division general. 
  The military council made the final assessment of all the 
activities of the FAR during 1993, which had already been 
previously analyzed in the last days of the mentioned year. The 
review demonstrated the gigantic and fruitful effort in the 
three armies with all the types of weapons that defend the 
national territory, which shows a strengthening of the combat 
capacity and readiness to successfully wage the people's war in 
case of enemy aggression. 
  Significant progress was achieved in the combat readiness of 
the personnel, which in Cuba includes millions of men and women 
of the FAR and the reserves of the Territorial Troops Militia 
[MTT] and the production and defense brigades. 
  Last year's maintenance and conservation of equipment and 
arms and preparation of the theater of military operations 
demanded arduous and intense labor that included several million 
weapons and war equipment and the mobilization of hundreds of 
thousands of men and women in the country to build the people's 
defense tunnels and other fortifications. 
  These heroic deeds performed in 1993 are a continuation of 
the heroic deeds achieved in the two previous years. The results 
of the three years as a whole have elevated the vitality of the 
combat arms and equipment, and the protection of these by the 
combatants and the civil population in the face of eventual 
enemy aggression. All this was achieved in midst of the 
shortages of the special period. 
  Another important point on the agenda was the FAR's 
activities in the agricultural-livestock areas, which are aimed 
at achieving self-sufficiency among the troops. As in the past 
year, the food production goals for 1994 represent a 30 percent 
increase, which would get the FAR closer to its goal of becoming 
completely self sufficient. Great emphasis was placed on all 
military agricultural-livestock enterprises working towards 
reducing costs and increasing productivity and yields, which is 
the only way to achieve affordability and profitability. It was 
mentioned that the Youth Labor Army [EJT] cares for 15,000 
caballerias of land throughout the country and that they produce 
632,000 tons of food annually for the national economy. 
  The reduction of the military budget by 50 percent was 
another encouraging observation that the council session made. 
This contributes to reducing the deficit of the state budget. 
The elevated conduct of discipline and the moral and political 
state of the troops were described as satisfactory. The council 
was happy to verify that the work of the FAR's restructuring to 
adapt itself to the current conditions of the national economy 
was done as planned, while achieving the goal of maintaining the 
defensive power of the country and perfecting the FAR's 
efficiency and combat disposition, deepening even more the 
doctrinal and tactical concepts of the people's war. 
  The homage to General Carreras, on the occasion of his 50th 
anniversary as a combat pilot, highlighted his clean record, his 
stand against the Nazi-fascist movement, Batista's dictatorship, 
and U.S. imperialism, and his elevated patriotism, and 
revolutionary spirit. These feelings successively made him a 
combat pilot during World War II and the struggle against the 
fascist aggressors. He joined the national army when its role 
was defined by the Constitution of 1940 as body for the defense 
of national sovereignty. He joined the conspiracy that emerged 
from the heart of that army, as a rejection to Batista's 
military coup and was jailed by the tyranny for refusing to bomb 
the insurgent population of Cienfuegos. 
  In the unequal air combat against the mercenary aggression 
at the Bay of Pigs, Carreras had the opportunity he had hoped 
for since his youth: defend national independence in the most 
audacious and risky situation in the skies of the fatherland. He 
shot down two B-26 airplanes and made serious attacks on the 
enemy naval group. His heroism in those battles and his 
extensive record of service to the Revolution made him worthy of 
the title: hero of the Republic of Cuba. Carreras, who is 71 
years old, continues to be an active member of the FAR. He is 
one of those generals that die with their boots on. 
  Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, first substitute 
to 
the Minister of the FAR and head of the General Staff, concluded 
the ceremony with these words: 
  [Begin Rosales recording] I am sure that I speak for the 
Minister of the FAR and all those present when I say that 
together with the fearlessness and courage, honesty and firmness 
of principles, General Carreras has the virtue of modesty and 
trustworthiness of which he has become a true model and which 
has never been tarnished by the deserved promotions and 
recognitions, including the honorary title of Hero of the 
Republic of Cuba. For that reason, I would like to conclude my 
speech by expressing to Division General Enrique Carreras Solas 
that our party, the people, and their FAR are proud to have you 
among its generals. We, the officers of the FAR, are honored to 
be able to be your comrade in arms, and disciples of your 
personal example. Thank you very much. [applause] [end recording] 
  Present at the ceremony were Retired Division General 
(Hector 
Rios Eregnu). (Rios), who is a retired officer of the sister 
Republic of Argentina, is in Cuba with his family on a private 
visit and was invited by the Minister of the FAR to attend the 
ceremony.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F>
Review"] 
  [Text] Cuban authorities have truth as their main weapon, 
and, therefore, a swift and forceful denial of a newspaper 
report on an alledged meeting of Colombian guerrilla groups in 
Havana achieved its objective -- to nip in the bud a spectacular 
maneuver to stop the swift enhancement of ties between Cuba and 
Colombia. Nevertheless, Cuba's initial explanations were ignored 
by the right-wing Colombian newspaper EL TIEMPO and other forces 
that strive, both within and outside of the South American 
nation, to spoil the friendly atmosphere between the two nations. 
  The highest-ranking Cuban authorities confirmed that no 
rebel 
leader, or even Bishop Nel Beltran, attended the fourth 
solidarity meeting held in Havana in June when, according to EL 
TIEMPO's version, they reportedly held a summit. Cuba's swift 
investigation of the Colombian newspaper's allegations, which 
were repeated by some of that country's officials, shows the 
Cuban Government's intention to expose a maneuver that could 
very well be connected with the extremist groups of Cuban 
immigrants in the United States. 
  One cannot forget the reaction, tinged with hysteria, of 
ultra-conservative members of that community who are threatening 
to boycott Colombian products in the United States. Miami radio 
stations that respond to the interests of the extreme right-wing 
groups in the Cuban immigrant community have not stopped 
speaking about the eventual sale of Colombian oil to Cuba, which 
both parties were negotiating to the subsequent disgust of those 
who struggle to paralyze the island by the lack of fuel. 
  The Colombian newspaper EL TIEMPO's allegations have many 
dark facets, including attributing them to a military 
intelligence report which was later denied by the head of that 
department, Gen. Fernando Tapia. Also, Bishop Nel Beltran and 
other witnesses that remained with him in Miami during the time 
of his alledged stay in Havana with guerrilla leaders have 
rejected the prelate's participation in a meeting or his trip to 
the Cuban capital. 
  The scandal unleashed by EL TIEMPO has two chapters, the 
last 
of which has the character of a counteroffensive. It is to be 
expected that truth will prevail and that the newspaper will not 
subject its readers to a third episode of such a destructive 
story.

<F P=106> [Report by Villa Clara correspondent Boris Fuentes] </F>
  [Excerpts] At 0617 today, 21 March, there was a railway 
accident in the place known as Cumbre, located in Placetas 
Municipality, Villa Clara Province. A train made up of 23 tanker 
cars full of oil coming from Cienfuegos Province crashed into 
another freight train, which was parked and waiting for the 
go-ahead. The crash resulted in serious injuries to two crew 
members. [passage omitted] 
  Of the train's 23 tank cars, only two suffered damage, and 
thanks to quick action taken, it was possible to save a great 
part of the fuel they were carrying. 
  Captain Ardelio Garcia, deputy provincial criminal 
investigations chief in Villa Clara Province, comments on the 
causes of the accident: 
  [Begin Garcia recording] It is nothing more than a violation 
of the railway's operating regulations. The human factor. We 
have seen that there was an obvious violation of the right of 
way. [end recording] 
  Just hours after the accident, the track had been put back 
in 
working order, and the material damages were being assessed.

  [Text] The military prosecutor in charge of the case of the 
murder of Jean Paul Genie today applied a precautionary measure 
to General Humberto Ortega. 
  Today, Gen. Ortega for the first time presented himself at 
the Military Prosecutor's Office to testify on the case of the 
young Genie. The Army chief testified for more than five hours 
regarding the charges of his alleged responsibility in the Genie 
killing. The general said that on the day Genie died, 28 
October 1990, he was in his residence. He said the Army has 
been supporting the Investigative Commission as a result of 
conversations he has had with other high-ranking officers and in 
response to a request from former Government Minister Carlos 
Hurtado. 
  During the lengthy questioning, the prosecution asked about 
the Army chief's movements and the administrative structure of 
the Army. At the end of the interrogation, Prosecutor Lester 
Gallo ordered precautionary measures against Gen. Ortega. 
  [Begin recording] [Ortega] In my case, having assumed my own 
defense, the precautionary measure ordered by the Military 
Prosecutor's Office is to limit my movements for a lawfully 
established period of time in my home town, which is Managua. 
  [Raymond Genie, father of Jean Paul Genie] As we see it, 
house arrest is not important. The magnitude of the sentence 
must correspond to the magnitude of the crime. These moves are 
aimed at earning much public attention and at producing 
international effects to later shun the matter. [end recording]

extreme rightist sectors that want to destroy the military 
organization and him personally.

  [Text] Army Chief General Humberto Ortega said he is 
willing to show the national and international public that the 
death of young Jean Paul Genie is being used in an effort to mar 
Ortega's image and that of the Army. Gen. Ortega said that the 
fact that he responded to a summons to testify at the Judge 
Advocate's Office shows respect for the law and an interest in 
the thorough clarification of the case. 
  [Begin Ortega recording] An effort is being made to tarnish 
my image and that of the Army by taking this case to the OAS 
International Court. They are trying to see how they can do 
something (?adverse). On the contrary, the law is being 
respected in this case. We are complying with the law. 
  The Genie case first went to the civil courts, then it was 
sent -- as the law stipulates in Nicaragua -- to the Judge 
Advocate's Office. The case was then passed on to the Supreme 
Court of Justice, which confirmed the civil judge's ruling that 
the case should be reviewed by the judge advocate. So I am here 
today, and my presence is evidence of the fact that we are 
responsibly complying with Nicaraguan law. I think that is what 
is most important. It has also allowed us to ratify our 
commitment to the Army in the public letter I signed. The 
letter clearly stated my position on the fact that this case has 
been politicized. The goals being pursued have nothing to do 
empathy for the Genie family. It is really an effort to use the 
family's sorrow to harm the Army and to mar our image. [end

<F P=106> [From the "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Bernard Pallais has 
been summoned to testify in the Jean Paul Genie murder trial. 
The judge advocate today summoned Pallais to testify as a 
witness in the trial against eight security escorts of General 
Humberto Ortega, chief of the Nicaraguan Army, for the murder of 
a young man in 1990. 
  At the time of the crime, Pallais was deputy government 
minister and was involved in the investigations, according to 
Judge Advocate Lieutenant Lester Gallo, who explained to Pallais 
the reasons behind his being called to testify. The military 
court last month opened the trial in connection with the death 
of Jean Paul Genie Lacayo, who was sprayed with gunfire when he 
attempted to drive past a military caravan along the road to 
Masaya on the outskirts of Managua. Gen. Humberto Ortega made 
statements [words indistinct] as a defendant, and, after the 
inquiry concluded, the judge advocate asked him not to leave 
Managua. This was interpreted by the press as a form of house 
arrest. The restraining order will be in force throughout the 
duration of the murder trial, which, according to defense 
attorney Mariano Barahona, could last anywhere from three weeks 
to more than a month. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Pallais is a member of the 
Tripartite 
Commission created by Violeta Chamorro's government to 
investigate the murders of former contras, which took place 
between 1990-1992 -- murders to which members of the EPS 
[Sandinist People's Army] have been linked. This commission 
also includes members of the Catholic Church and the OAS, and it 
has pointed its finger at the EPS as a violator of human rights 
in light of the fact that the EPS failed to try those soldiers 
allegedly responsible for the murders.

<F P=106> [Article by Oscar Merlo: "Precautionary Measure Against </F>
Humberto"] 
  [Text] General Humberto Ortega, commander of the Sandinist 
People's Army [EPS], has been forced to sign a restraining order 
issued against him by Judge Advocate Lieutenant Lester Gallo. 
In signing this order, Gen. Ortega has agreed not to leave his 
quarters. If he does, he could face stronger restrictive 
measures. 
  In what is an unprecedented event in our country's legal 
history, Gen. Ortega took the stand donned in an impeccable 
military uniform on which his laurels and stars glistened. 
Ortega gave a deposition -- which lasted nearly six hours -- as 
a defendant [indiciado] in the Jean Paul Genie Lacayo murder 
trial. 
  Following the session, Judge Advocate Gallo issued the 
restraining order, which some journalists have interpreted as 
giving Ortega "the city for a jail." This also failed to 
satisfy the plaintiff. 
  In announcing the order, Gallo cited Articles 92, 98, and 
100 
of Section 2 of the Judge Advocacy Organizational Law under the 
Provisional Military Procedural Code, as well as Article 34, 
Section 4 of the Constitution as legal grounds for his action. 
  The judge advocate said the order was issued because of the 
specific nature of the defendant's occupation and because he has 
assumed his own defense. 
  The measure against Gen. Ortega prohibits him from leaving 
the capital unless he has permission from the judge advocate and 
only in cases related to performing of his duty, for health 
reasons, or for self-improvement purposes, such as when his 
studies take him outside of Managua. 
  Once the restraining order was announced, Humberto Ortega 
held a news conference and said he accepted the order only to 
clear the EPS' name, which Ortega said some have sought to 
tarnish by taking the Genie case to the Inter-American Human 
Rights Court. 
  The military chief said his taking the stand as a defendant 
in no way lessens his authority as Army commander. 
  On the contrary, he said: "The law recognizes those who 
honestly submit to it. In no way is it degrading to comply with 
the law and justice." 
  Humberto Ortega argued throughout his deposition that the 
accusations filed against him and eight members of his security 
escort in connection with the death of Jean Paul Genie are 
purely political in nature. 
  Before entering the courtroom, Gen. Ortega disclosed a 
letter 
in which he denies any wrongdoing whatsoever in the Genie murder. 
  He also made it clear that this case was "a tangible example 
of how political hatred and revenge have made it possible to use 
this tragic and painful event, which still must be clarified, as 
a shameless weapon to escalate the campaigns directed at 
destroying the EPS." 
<H5>  Asks To Be Relieved of Duties </H5>
  Humberto Ortega also referred to a letter he sent on 18 
March 
to Colonel Alvaro Baltdodano, secretary general of the EPS 
General Command, asking to be relieved of those duties directly 
linked to military justice because he considered this to be "a 
legal and moral obligation." In other words, the Army chief 
asked to not be informed, as the law mandates, about any direct 
or indirect action related to the Genie murder trial. 
  In this letter, Gen. Ortega said he accepted the judge 
advocate's decision to summon him to testify as a defendant in 
keeping with Article 22 of the Military Organization Law, which, 
among other things, states that the EPS commander in chief must 
respect and obey, comply, and, within the Army, ensure 
compliance with the Political Constitution, constitutional law, 
and other laws. 
<H5>  His Testimony </H5>
  Humberto Ortega started to testify at 1100 sharp. He replied 
to nearly identical questions posed to the others by the judge 
advocate and Dr. Olivas Zuniga, who, in this case, were the ones 
who spent the most time interrogating the officer. 
  Although he remained seated for several hours, Ortega 
appeared serene, and, with aplomb, he answered all questions 
posed to him on his alleged connection to the slaying of Jean 
Paul Genie. 
  He was coherent in his statements, and, apparently, he 
managed to exasperate Dr. Olivas Zuniga and Mr. Raymond Genie, 
who are receiving counsel from two other lawyers and a 
representative of the ANPDH [Nicaraguan Human Rights 
Association], an anti-Sandinist human rights organization. 
  Humberto Jose Ortega Saavedra -- 47, five feet, 11 inches 
tall, born in Juigalpa, Chontales -- described himself as "a 
professional in political and military affairs." 
  His criminal record only shows prison sentences imposed by 
the Somozist dictatorship for his revolutionary activities that 
led to the toppling of Anastasio Somoza Debayle on 19 July 1979. 
  The Army chief's statements about his schedule on 28 October 
1990 -- the day of the murder -- agreed with those of his 
bodyguards. It was at last known why he had stopped by the home 
of Col. Lenin Cerna, even though he was out of the country on 
that day. 
  According to Humberto Ortega, he entered the home of Cerna, 
who was single at that time, to pick up several documents that 
would be useful for a meeting with demobilized members of the 
Nicaraguan Resistance the next day. Ortega explained that he 
had keys to Cerna's home for security reasons. 
  During his testimony, Ortega rejected reports issued by the 
Venezuelan Commission, which "investigated" the case in record 
time and even issued conclusions, and by the Tripartite 
Commission headed by the current Deputy Foreign Minister Jose 
Pallais. Ortega described both groups as "biased and 
politicized."

<F P=106> ["Public Letter by General Humberto Ortega Saavedra" -- EL </F>
NUEVO DIARIO headline] 
  [Text] 1. The Genie case merits enough concern for me to 
make public my position in this regard, particularly taking into 
consideration the serious situation prevailing over the entire 
national territory. This is the result of the economic, 
political, and social crisis which Nicaraguan society is 
desperately experiencing. 
  2. The Genie case is a clear demonstration of how political 
revenge and hate have made possible the use of a tragic and 
painful incident -- not yet cleared up -- as a shameless weapon 
to heighten the campaigns that attempt to destroy the Army that 
I command with honor. This is also an attempt to damage my image 
formed in the 1960's during the revolutionary struggle for a 
worthy and better nation for all Nicaraguans. 
  3. The Genie case demonstrates how far the radical minority 
can go with its lies and appalling maneuvers aimed at crushing 
the EPS [Sandinist People's Army] by judging and then destroying 
it. That vengeful minority has attempted in vain to make 
innocent persons into guilty persons. They have resorted to 
using the family of young Jean Paul Genie as an instrument 
without really caring about the terrible pain that the tragic 
death of a loved one causes. 
  4. The vengeful minority has irresponsibly attempted to 
convert the innocent figure of Jean Paul into a political weapon 
against the EPS, lacking respect for the memory of a youth whom 
I am totally certain never would have agreed to be a pawn of 
those petty politicians. 
  5. The Genie case has also stirred up those in the United 
States who have pretended during more than a century to have at 
their whims Nicaraguans' dignity and national pride. They, the 
Helmses and the like who insolently dismissed the ruling of the 
International Court of Justice at The Hague, attempt to put us 
on the international stand. This is to humiliate us and to 
serve as a warning to the people throughout Latin America who 
firmly wave the Bolivar flag for independence, 
self-determination, democracy, and economic development with 
social justice. 
  6. The Genie case has opened the way to violate the human 
rights of EPS officers. Although innocent, they have been 
submitted to systematic pressures by lies and false accusations 
-- that also adversely affect our families -- through the 
diverse media in our nation attempting to make us relinquish our 
indomitable moral. 
  7. The Genie case is added to the campaign that the radical 
minority is waging through the well-known Tripartite Commission 
and the alleged defense of human rights. The goal is to 
politically and morally bring discredit to the officers and the 
rank and file of the Nicaraguan military institution. 
  8. The Genie case unfolds at a time when the EPS, for the 
sake of reconciliation and total peace, has been the key 
instrument used by those who have laid down their weapons to 
move towards demobilization and to become integrated into the 
nation's normal life by pardoning serious crimes they have 
committed. Meanwhile, the vengeful minority pretends that 
innocent persons should be condemned within the framework of the 
Genie case and the Tripartite Commission. 
  9. As those seeking revenge continue to manipulate the 
Genie case, Nicaragua, for basic national security 
reasons, must face the grave situation the country is 
experiencing and avoid a widespread collapse that could immerse 
Nicaragua in anarchy and abject poverty. Stability will 
undoubtedly enable Nicaragua to create the wealth needed to 
gradually defeat poverty and the underdevelopment accumulated 
during a century of misunderstanding, war, and all kinds of 
conflict. 
  10. The extremist minority manipulating the Genie case 
opposes the Nicaraguan majority that wants total peace, 
security, and order within the framework of a 
disciplined de jure state. These things are 
necessary to jumpstart the economy -- and, in particular, to 
encourage agricultural production -- as well as to attract 
much-needed foreign investments, because financial cooperation 
is scarce and is quickly tending to disappear. 
  11. This same vindictive minority, which is manipulating the 
heartfelt passions that surround the Genie case, also is 
hindering production, which is crucial to combat the nation's 
very serious unemployment. Moreover, how can there be 
sufficient basic production to stabilize the nation if 
reconciliation and socioeconomic consensus are not achieved 
among the main sectors of the nation, including the political, 
socioeconomic, labor, and institutional sectors? 
  How can we engender production without resolving the 
property 
issue or, moreover, without resolving the situation of thousands 
of peasants, repatriated people, former Army members, and former 
RN [Nicaraguan Resistance] members who are demanding urgent 
solutions to issues involving property titles, loans, and other 
economic matters? 
  How can there be production if a few wealthy people take 
advantage of the crisis to accumulate land and capital at the 
expense of wrecking the work of producers and large and 
mid-sized businesses? 
  What will happen to the tens of thousands of citizens whose 
livelihoods depend on their small businesses, shops, and farms? 
What will happen to salaried workers? 
  12. Everybody must overcome the Genie case's 
exploitation by the enemies of peace and unite to preserve 
Nicaragua. May the bloodshed of today be used as an irrevocable 
commitment to ensure that this same blood, instead of dividing 
us, brings us together, thereby enabling the children of those 
of us who have fought to the death to never have to do such a 
thing again. All of us must accept one another in a new 
Nicaragua -- a new Nicaragua we all must begin forging today. 
  I end this public letter hoping that the memory of Jean Paul 
will not continue to be manipulated in a vindictive manner. 
  [Signed] Sincerely, Humberto Ortega Saavedra 
  [Dated] 21 March 1994

  [Text] Managua, 22 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Unidentified gunmen 
today murdered Cesar Barahona, the Sandinist National Liberation 
Front's [FSLN] political secretary in Wiwili Municipality, near 
the border with Honduras. FSLN sources report that the body of 
Barahona, who was kidnapped yesterday by a group of rebels of 
unknown political affiliation, was found by Army troops in Aguas 
Rojas, some 7 km from Wiwili. 
  Barahona was killed while carrying a list of regional 
delegates who are to participate in the FSLN's special congress 
in May. According to political sources, the activist could have 
been kidnapped and murdered for "being a Sandinist." Police 
have not released any official explanation.

<F P=106> [Article by Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>
  [Text] Italian Ambassador to Managua Gianguido Lanzani had 
two farewells. The first was on Sunday. The second came 
yesterday morning around 0930. The last farewell had not been 
announced, and instead, it was chaotic, brief, and unpleasant. 
  A total of 34 former soldiers of the Movement for the 
Defense 
of National Sovereignty (MDSN) trespassed into the gardens of 
the Italian Embassy to demand the fulfillment of the agreements 
signed in October in exchange for their demobilization. 
  These agreements include the delivery of 240 Italian 
packages 
(construction materials valued at $500 per package), food 
packages (each valued at $80), and 3,000 cordobas for each rifle 
turned in. 
  According to the former soldiers, some of whom were involved 
in last September's kidnapping of UNO's [National Opposition 
Union] top leaders, some former soldiers were told they would be 
"attended to" first and, after that, the rest. 
  One of the former soldiers standing near the Montoya 
monument 
said: "None of the three things promised have been given to any 
of us. They said that one month after our demobilization, which 
occurred in October, they would give us a response... but as of 
now, we have not received anything." 
  Violet Chamorro's government also promised them a 3,000 
manzana security zone... "but we have received nothing up until 
today," said one of the group's spokesmen. "Instead, they 
evicted us from San Cristobal, where we had begun planing.... 
Those crops are now lost." 
  At 1040, after a brief discussion with Subcommander Manuel 
Ledezma, head of patrols in Managua, only one negotiating 
commission remained at the embassy. The demobilized soldiers 
remained standing outside the embassy in the scorching Lenten 
sun. 
  The Cenidh [Nicaraguan Human Rights Center], from which the 
former soldiers sought mediation, rejected the soldiers' actions 
as being illegal, although Cenidh considered their demands fair. 
Cenidh Director Vilma Nunez said she understood their 
frustration, especially taking into account the manner in which 
the government is now negotiating with El Chacal [3-80 Northern 
Front rebel leader Jose Angel Talavera]. 
  At approximately 1330, after negotiators Edwin Gomez, 
Fidencio Duarte, and two Italian Embassy officials returned to 
the Special Disarmament Brigades [BED] Headquarters, an 
agreement was announced: "We will meet at BED Headquarters on 
Tuesday at 1000 to discuss the timetable for commitments to be 
met." 
  The atmosphere was bittersweet. One of the men, angered and 
frustrated, said: "If this time they fail to keep their 
promises, we will return to the mountains, and then they will 
have to fulfill the commitments."

<F P=106> [Article by Horacio Ruiz: "Two Visits and Only One Enigma"] </F>
  [Text] [U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for 
Inter-American Affairs Alexander] Watson and [IMF Director 
Michael] Camdessus arrived in Nicaragua this week; their visits 
produced enigmatic statements and no solution or prospect for 
better times. On the contrary, it seems that upon entering 
Nicaragua's polluted air both gentlemen lost their sense of 
direction and started speaking erratically that, at least for 
this observer, has created more confusion than hope. 
  We do not know if this is a common situation, but we cannot 
help commenting on the fact that Watson referred to the 
Sandinists as "a legally constituted political party" in 
Nicaragua. In other words, he came to give us old news. In 
reality, Sandinism has been legal for a long time, so long that 
it is legally registered, it has definite legal representation, 
and has lost 2 to 1 in the electoral field since 1984. In other 
words, it has lost two elections and won one, and in that one it 
did not have a real contender. 
  Mr. Watson is gone, and we do not know why he came to give 
us 
that kind of news. When he tried to take the bull by the horns, 
it was disastrous. General Humberto Ortega was bold enough to 
tell him to his face that he will not tolerate another situation 
like 2 September 1993, when the legitimate Nicaraguan President, 
Violeta de Chamorro, hinted, not ordered, that she would like 
Gen. Ortega to resign in 1994. In other words, Gen. Ortega 
discounted the top civilian authority in the country in front of 
Mr. Watson. Ortega, who had already insolently rejected 
President Chamorro's suggestion, now clearly repeated his 
response to the State Department. Those who live on illusions 
say that Gen. Ortega already knows he must leave and that he was 
just bragging in front of the Yankees. Frankly, it is difficult 
to be that optimistic. Ortega is not an actor, and as things 
stand now, he could very well resign in 1994 but then again he 
may not. 
  Having given the people's representation to the National 
Assembly to the Sandinists, Ortega could even become a 
presidential candidate, with his general stars and all. There is 
no real obstacle to that if he decided to become Nicaragua's 
dictator. Those who sold the people's electoral victory in 1990 
would not be able to stop him because they did not stop him in 
1990 when they should have. 
  We thought Camdessus came to sign a document entitled ESAF 
[Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility], which requires no 
translation, but according to experts is the last hope for the 
country's economy even though it includes a tremendous increase 
in the severe tax system confronting Nicaraguans. 
  Camdessus, however, came to tell us that the ESAF would not 
be signed in March as the government expected, but maybe in 
June. What is ESAF? Apparently, large sums of money obtained 
through long-term credits at very low interest rates. The 
surprising part was that Camdessus, who apparently knows nothing 
about Nicaragua either, also came to tell us that we have 
already asked for too much and to tell us that "we must save." 
Save what? White collar workers are burdened with taxes, can 
barely cover their needs, and have nothing left to save. As for 
blue collar workers, they not only lack the funds to save; they 
have no jobs to survive. Although some economic sectors have 
managed to save some money, they did it during better days and 
they are firmly protecting those funds so as to avoid falling in 
the complete depression that lays ahead should the ESAF not be 
signed and Gen. Ortega decides to ignore the calls to submit his 
retirement, both valid possibilities. 
  In other words, Mr. Watson and Mr. Camdessus came here, very 
deferentially, to tell us that the Sandinist party is a 
legitimate party and that we should save. That is really 
impossible. The only way we as a nation could start saving is by 
implementing drastic reductions in the country's costly Armed 
Forces, which is headed by Gen. Ortega, who does not want to 
resign. 
  As some friends once told Cardinal Miguel Obando, it would 
seem there are no solutions for Nicaragua's problems. At that 
time, the cardinal said that despite everything, we must all 
continue to pray for Nicaragua. That is all we have left.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Managua LA PRENSA in Spanish of 1 March 
1994 on page 4 reports that Camoapa farmers exported 15,000 
pounds of cheese to El Salvador during the last two weeks of 
February. Producer Mario Aragon predicted March exports will 
total 60,000 pounds. According to Aragon, producers began 
exporting cheese when processing plants reduced purchases of 
milk. As a result, dairy farmers have had fewer losses from 
surplus milk, production costs have dropped, and profits have 
risen. Producers say that El Salvador is the best Central 
American market for cheese. 
  The article also reports that the Hermoso Vijil company has 
begun exporting typewriter ribbons to Spain, Germany, Italy, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States. Near-term exports are 
expected to total $6 million. The company plans to expand 
operations to include the manufacture of photocopier material, 
laser printers, and diskettes.

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Katin] </F>
  [Text] The Supreme Court of Justice [CSJ] contends the wave 
of mass evictions nationwide within the past three weeks could 
lead to an explosive crisis with unpredictable consequences. 
  CSJ President Orlando Trejos Somarriba said the eviction 
cases will be studied by a special commission comprising 
representatives from the National Assembly and various 
magistrates. He added: "This is an issue with serious 
consequences involving all state branches." 
  Dr. Rodolfo Robelo, a commission member -- the commission 
also includes Rodolfo Vargas Sandino and Alba Luz Ramos -- told 
BARRICADA that no specific agreements were reached in Tuesday's 
meeting with various Sandinist party representatives, but he 
added that there was a CSJ initiative "to begin an in-depth 
investigation" of more than 1,000 evictions occuring within the 
past three weeks. 
  The National Assembly should appoint a group of deputies 
from 
different parties to begin the investigation no later than 
Monday. 
  Robelo said only the investigation will confirm or deny 
accusations on the alleged politization of court orders, and he 
declined any further comments. 
  Nevertheless, Magistrate Robelo said that if the commission 
confirms the irregularities reported by the injured parties -- 
namely, that many of the decisions resulted from widespread 
political corruption within the judicial branch -- "the CSJ has 
the authority to not only sanction the judicial officials who 
have taken part in these presumed irregularities, but also to 
try those officials in compliance with the country's laws." 
  Magistrate Robelo said: "I want to make it clear that this 
investigation in no way will undermine the independence of the 
judicial branch," like some self-serving individuals have 
claimed concerning the parliamentary initiative to resort 
directly to the CSJ. 
  "Rulings on these cases will be issued by various judges of 
this state branch," Dr. Robelo added. 
  Concerning the evictions still being carried out, Robelo 
issued an appeal to the people, urging them "to understand that 
when a decision is made, it must be carried out." 
  The magistrate also explained the difference concerning 
cases 
between private individuals, over which the state has no 
jurisdiction, and those cases in which it does have 
jurisdiction. "It is one thing when the state has awarded 
property to someone, in which case the state has to assume 
responsibility," said Robelo, pointing out that the plaintiff 
must take action against the state rather than against the 
person who occupies a house or other type of property. 
  Robelo believes that in cases in which a poor person has 
been 
favored by the state with a home or property, "his rights to 
that property should be respected when he fulfills all the legal 
obligations." 
  Meanwhile, CSJ President Orlando Trejos rejected the charge 
that the execution of justice is being delayed within his state 
branch. 
  "What is happening is that, because there is no court for 
administrative disputes, all cases come directly to us when they 
actually only need an administrative legal ruling," Dr. Trejos 
said. 
  The CSJ president has been approached by a group of former 
customs employees who have been waiting for a court decision 
since June to recover their jobs. The magistrate has promised 
to receive them in his office on Monday.

  [Text] The National Central Organization of Panamanian 
Workers (CNTP), which comprises three workers' federations and 
16 unions for a total of 12,000 workers, has proclaimed its 
determination to support Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares for the 
presidency of the Republic. 
  In an "electoral communique" signed by CNTP Secretary 
General 
Luis Cobos R., the organization said it hopes that with this 
decision "we will achieve the return of the Torrijist forces to 
power to stimulate the process of national liberation." 
  The workers' organization also voiced its support for Andres 
Vega Cedeno, also known as "Domplin," a radio commentator who is 
running for mayor of Panama City; and recommended that "the 
workers also vote for Felipe Cano, who is running for mayor of 
San Miguelito." 
  As for the "candidates for 1994-1999 legislators," the CNTP 
recommends that "workers and popular movements support the 
candidates committed to our efforts and suggests the names of 
two candidates from the Papa Egoro Movement: Norma Cano in 
electoral circuit 8.6, and Rolando Miller in circuit 8.9, whom 
the workers describe as "great fighters." [quotation marks as 
published] 
  The CNTP feels that Norma Cano is a "labor leader with vast 
experience," and that Rolando Miller is a union champion "who 
showed ability and honesty in the struggle against the 
neoliberal and persecution policies of the current regime."

<F P=106> [Quotation marks as published] </F>
  [Text] "The mere fact Magistrate Guillermo Marquez Amado 
has strangely delayed the ruling on Mayin Correa's case for an 
illogical period of time clearly proves the official's high 
degree of evident partiality and disqualifies him for that 
post," it was stated yesterday by Jaime Padilla Beliz, president 
of the EL SIGLO Publishing Company. 
  The judicial scandal provoked by this clever decision will 
have continental repercussions, he added. The statements were 
given within the context of a meeting among various parties to 
consider the measures and actions that will be adopted when the 
unfair and absurd ruling occurs; and it will undoubtedly 
threaten the elections scheduled for 8 May. 
  Padilla Beliz has explained he attended most of the 
sessions, 
which were extended for two weeks, and no documents or any other 
evidence were presented to prove Mayor Mayin Correa had 
committed the electoral crimes with which she was charged. The 
only thing done was to present depositions signed by her sworn 
enemies, without any proof or evidence, and it was proved most 
of them lied. This was personally admitted in public by 
Magistrate Guillermo Marquez Amado (Pico), who was in charge of 
the proceedings. 
  Padilla Beliz continued: "Despite all this, Magistrate 
Marquez Amado insists on sentencing her, and he has prepared a 
ruling of approximately 32 pages, sentencing and disqualifying 
her for public posts for several years. He also suspended her 
prison sentence, given the lack of a criminal record, as was 
done in the case of former Attorney General Rogelio Cruz." 
  No decent person in the country will accept such a 
monstrosity, Padilla Beliz has said. "This is a country where 
lowly feelings and shameful cowardice abound. Politicians know 
Mayin is right, and she is already the city's mayor-elect with 
74 percent of the votes, according to the latest poll. 
Nevertheless, they do not dare protest because they are afraid 
of the Electoral Tribunal, and they state cunningly: "They are 
the judges, and you cannot go against them." 
  They are also the ones who will tally the votes, and they 
can 
really screw us if we oppose them in Mayin's case." That is the 
reasoning used by men who have no courage, honor, pride. I 
would rather die defending the truth and reason then to 
humiliate myself and kneel before the powerful." 
  It is known a magistrate had stated he will not sign the 
document, because he attended the trial and no one proved Mayin 
was guilty of anything." 
  Padilla Beliz asked: How, then, can Mayin be sentenced? It 
was learned the president of the Republic has personally 
threatened one of the magistrates, saying he will fire the 
magistrate's wife from a position to which she was recently 
appointed, if he rules in favor of Mayin. This happens because 
a degenerate midget who was one of General Manuel Antonio 
Noriega's intimate friends and who changed sides when he 
realized the gringos would oust him has become director of First 
Lady Ana Mae Diaz de Endara's campaign for mayor. He recently 
fabricated a poll that shows the president's wife leads in the 
polls. 
  Consequently, the president believes his wife will be mayor 
of the capital if he eliminates Mayin. 
  Padilla Beliz concluded: "They are toying with the people's 
patience, however, and anything -- for example, the Christian 
Democratic magistrate's ruling -- could unleash violence and the 
cancellation of the elections. 
  "I ask the Supreme Electoral Tribunal magistrates to 
meditate 
well what they can do. Set aside personal and partisan hate and 
lead the country to honest and clean elections."

<F P=106> [Article by Roberto Montanez] </F>
  [Text] In view of the transcendental changes to foreign 
relations, in which the EEC, Pacific Basin, and NAFTA have 
starring roles, the integration phenomenon stands out as an 
inescapable foreign policy issue for the states that are trying 
to break into the international arena. 
  In fact, the administration that will take control of 
Panama's destiny will have to face the crucial dilemma of 
efficiently consolidating the canal management transition 
process. The new government will also have to dodge neoliberal 
impositions that could undermine the gradual integration process 
of the canal infrastructures, which will revert to the national 
economy. 
  The new government will face a new plan regarding relations 
with the United States, which will be driven by the imminent 
withdrawal of military troops and the progressive 
nationalization of the canal. This situation is being 
conditioned by cuts in the defense budget with the end of the 
Cold War. The issue of national security is not a priority for 
the region yet simply because the international financial system 
replaced the confrontation of ideologies. 
  As the United States readjusts its economy to consolidate 
the 
360 million people market that NAFTA, an agreement also signed 
by Mexico and Canada, will create, its regional priorities deal 
with the eradication of drug trafficking, as the new Southern 
Command chief proposed, and trade deregulation, as international 
financial institutions are promoting. 
  Under the circumstances, it is necessary to redefine 
bilateral relations not only politically and economically, but 
also jurisdictionally to ensure a trouble-free transition of the 
canal administration; that is, a transition that will not be at 
the mercy of the country's political stability. This is why the 
new government will have the prerequisite of restoring the part 
of the Panamanian state's self-determination that the 20 
December 1989 invasion removed. 
  On those grounds, leaders will have to apply daring 
solutions 
to the problems that bilateral diplomatic relations have 
exacerbated over the last few years, namely the post-invasion 
upheaval, collective mechanisms against drug trafficking, and 
the transition of the canal administration. 
  In the regional arena, leaders must use dynamic solutions to 
reinforce the nation's presence in organizations of political 
consensus like the Rio Group. Leaders will even be compelled to 
improve hemispheric relations, which visibly deteriorated after 
the invasion because of the regime of rigid bilateral foreign 
policies. 
  At the multilateral level, the new government will have to 
determine its position on GATT, not just because of the timid 
interest the current administration has showed, but also because 
of its inability to reconcile the interests of the economic 
sectors, which favor trade deregulation, and the industrial 
sectors that remain skeptical because of the uncertainty that 
joining this organization will generate. Given such a big 
challenge, there is a need for a government with leadership and 
the ability to establish consensus at the lowest social cost 
possible; a consensus that will explain in equitable and 
balanced terms the competitive advantages the country will have 
upon joining the integrationist movement. 
  The approval of the Sea Convention Law [Convencion sobre 
Derecho del Mar], which was postponed for the last few years, is 
another pivotal issue in foreign policies because Panama holds 
first place in world merchant marine tonnage and is on the 
threshold of managing an interoceanic canal with the potential 
to tap maritime resources. 
  Integrationist initiatives are usually the result of a 
historic process of accumulation by which states modernize their 
production processes by systematically embarking in 
international trade to seek competitive advantages to ensure 
strengthening their economies. These assumptions in Panama have 
yet to materialize. That is why it is necessary to consolidate 
the national economy, to bring it closer to the countries with 
negotiating capabilities in the integration dynamics. 
  This is why we cannot conceive of separating political 
integration from economic factors, nor can it (Central American 
integration) be the result of rhetorical pronouncements that do 
not come from objective analyses of the country's political and 
socioeconomic realities. Therefore, by being aware of the 
country's potentials and needs, the new government will have to 
adopt measures aimed at increasing plans for regional 
participation. 
  With this in mind, it will have to establish a series of 
foreign policy priorities by modernizing the political 
mechanisms of negotiation at the foreign ministry. Given the 
challenges inherent to the canal administration, this 
modernization necessarily means optimizing foreign services as 
the key instruments to incorporating Panama into the Latin 
American integration process.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 22 
March. 
  Francia de Sierra, director general of the Mineral Resources 
Directorate at the Ministry of Commerce and Industries, revealed 
the mining industry has invested $24 million this year, whereas 
in 1993 the investment was $5 million. Sierra added that 
production at the Santa Rosa mine, Canazas jurisdiction, 
Veraguas Province, will begin in June; this is expected to 
increase investments. Referring to the mining industry's 
future, she said a geologic study and an infrastructure 
inventory will be carried out in April. The study will cost 
between $10 million and $15 million and the cost of its 
feasibility study -- $450,000 -- will be paid with a donation 
from the Inter-American Development Bank. (Panama City LA PRENSA 
in Spanish 9 Mar 94 p 11A) 
  ``Delia de De Castro, director general of domestic trade,'' 
reported 556 licenses with an invested capital of $1,674,500 
were issued in January. She added that this represents $20,401 
in taxes. She said this is a 15 percent increase compared with 
January 1993, when the Ministry issued 480 permits for an 
invested capital of $1,909,650. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA 
in Spanish 15 Mar 94 p 11A) 
  The Panamanian Government has approved Executive Decree No. 
19 to confirm a 23 cent discount in the tariff for each box of 
bananas exported in 1994. The report adds that 38,255,291 boxes 
of bananas were exported in 1993, thus allowing the discount 
anticipated in Article 1 of Law 16, dated 18 June 1993. (Panama 
City LA PRENSA in Spanish 20 Mar 94 p 2) 
  Ricardo Duran, president of the Panamanian Chamber of 
Commerce, Industries, and Agriculture, has stated that growth 
levels will continue to rise although the country is engaged in 
an electoral process. A survey conducted by the chamber's 
Studies Center states the Panamanian economy registered stable 
growth levels, and the GNP attained a 6.6 percent growth rate.

  [Text] A few hours after the brief visit by U.S. Vice 
President Albert (Al) Gore to Buenos Aires, the balance made by 
Argentine officials was positive though not noisy, while U.S. 
officials felt that the points they wanted to conciliate in 
relations with Argentina are clearer than ever. 
  Gore's tour, which included Bolivia and continued in Brazil, 
is a preparatory visit for the Summit of the Americas that 
President Bill Clinton called for December in Miami, and to 
which Argentina wants to arrive in the best possible condition. 
  However, Gore's cascade of public praise for Argentina's 
economic boost, privatization policy, signing of 
nonproliferation treaties, and commitment to peacekeeping 
missions did not lighten the warnings and deadlines -- which are 
closer every day -- that he emphasized for complying with 
bilateral agenda topics. 
  -- First of all, Gore exerted full pressure for approval of 
a 
patents law. Like Foreign Trade Secretary Mickey Kantor made a 
week ago, Gore made it clear that if the law is not approved 
there will be commercial sanctions, and the swift pace toward 
NAFTA -- the free-trade agreement between the United States, 
Mexico and Canada -- will be lost. Argentina, Chile, and 
Colombia are candidates to join NAFTA. 
  -- Menem and his cabinet resorted to all sorts of gestures 
and phrases to prove the government's political will to promote 
the bill requested by the United States. But they had to admit 
that it will be impossible for them to have the bill approved 
before 30 April (the deadline the United States set to begin 
considering sanctions), but they promised to have it approved in 
a few days by the Senate committee studying the bill. 
  -- When commenting on the bill's details, Argentine 
officials 
hinted that beyond the law that will be approved by Congress, it 
will be the law's regulations -- to be issued by the executive 
branch -- that will set the tone for effectively enforcing the 
intellectual property law. 
  -- In return, Menem once again, and rather unsuccessfully, 
demanded that the United States give up its agricultural subsidy 
policy, which has seriously harmed Argentine interests. He once 
again listened to Gore make an old excuse: The issue of 
subsidies is very broad, involves all GATT talks, and the United 
States will not do it unilaterally while Europeans do not give 
up their own policy. 
  -- As for Menem's initiative to create a White Helmet unit 
within the United Nations to fight starvation, a decision was 
made to create a bilateral commission, which might meet next 
month in Washington and new York.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 22 Mar (NA) -- Foreign Ministry 
Secretary General Andres Cisneros has implicitly accepted the 
existence of a 30-April deadline imposed by the United States 
for Argentina to approve a new law on pharmaceutical patents. 
  Cisneros explained that U.S. laws "do not contain deadlines, 
but mechanisms for presenting proposals," admitting, however, 
that 30 April is the date foreseen in this mechanism. 
  The official said dates "are not arbitrarily set by U.S. 
executive officials." They are part of U.S. laws. 
  Cisneros explained that these laws "do not establish 
deadlines, but provide mechanisms and certain dates for 
submitting proposals." 
  The Foreign Ministry secretary said U.S. laws contemplate 
economic sanctions against Argentina if a new law on 
pharmaceutical patents is not approved within the established 
period. 
  Cisneros said the Argentine Government "will respond to this 
pressure, defending the country's interests." Cisneros added 
that the new law will not "solely respond to foreign pressure, 
but also to Argentina's national interests." 
  "U.S. Government and Argentine interests are not necessarily 
incompatible. Compatibility ends when interests become 
incongruous," Cisneros warned. 
  "This is not being difficult or different from what is being 
done by other Western economies in similar situations," Cisneros 
said, adding: "We are not doing anything different from what was 
done within the GATT." 
  Regarding the possibilities of the bill's approval by 
Congress, Cisneros said: "We do not see any problems." He 
added: "Congress will approve the measure when legislators think 
our national interests are served." Cisneros admitted that it 
will be very difficult to get a new law approved by the last day 
of next month. 
  "Economic sanctions are not good, but Argentina handles its 
own schedule for approving laws and pursues its own interests." 
  Cisneros confessed that U.S. Vice President Albert Gore 
received a sort of promise that the bill will finally be 
approved because the Government "must draft and send the bill 
and then get it approved."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 22 Mar (NA) -- Presidential Secretary 
General Eduardo Bauza categorically denied this afternoon that 
the government plans to promulgate by decree the pharmaceutical 
patents legislation if Congress delays approving the bill now 
being debated in the Senate. 
  "Under no circumstance will that happen" said Bauza, adding 
that the government "trusts" the bill will be approved by the 
Chamber of Deputies "possibly by the middle of this year."

<F P=106> [Article by Luis Garasino: "Where is the Enemy?"] </F>
  [Text] A seasoned foreign diplomat summed up the final 
document of the OAS experts meeting -- the starting point for 
the reformulation of the hemispheric security system -- held in 
Buenos Aires last week in the following terms: "Modest, but 
realistic." 
  The modesty and realism of the six recommendations drafted 
by 
diplomats and military from the Americas can be put down to the 
nefarious legacy of the past, which consisted of a continental 
security system designed on the basis of the existence of a cold 
war and the division of the world into two blocs. 
  Many nations of the hemisphere, especially those having 
democratic governments, cannot forget that the United States' 
interventionist hegemony was enshrined in the region in the name 
of anticommunism, and that to this effect, dictatorships of 
different leanings were supported and coups d'etat by the 
military encouraged. 
  Another sad heritage from those decades is the idea that the 
OAS simply rubber stamps and follows Washington's policy 
dictates. This explains the great reluctance evinced by some 
delegations to approve any multilateral security program that 
entails a limitation of their decisionmaking power. 
  It is an open secret that Brazil, for example, accepts 
collaboration in aspects pertaining to bilateral and regional 
security, but takes a stand against any scheme that seeks to go 
beyond these limits. 
  Hernan Patino Mayer, Argentine ambassador to the OAS and 
chairman of the Special Commission for Hemispheric Security, 
played a crucial role, but his presentation propounding "an 
all-encompassing" scheme was slashed to the necessary minimum 
limits for reaching consensus. 
  Proposals for holding periodic meetings between defense 
ministers from the hemisphere, turning the Inter-American 
Defense Board into an advisory body to the Council, or 
establishing a permanent center for solving conflicts, therefore 
came to nothing. 
  One of the six recommendations that were finally approved 
urges member countries "to regularly inform the appropriate OAS 
organs about the implementation of measures to foster trust." 
  It seemed evident that the "intercourse" between Argentina 
and the United States -- as well as the fact that the former's 
Armed Forces are those that are most subordinated to the 
political power of any in the region -- placed our country in a 
special situation. 
  Nevertheless, there are those who think that an essential 
stimulus is lacking for establishing a new security system -- 
the existence of a new common threat to the countries of the 
Americas, an enemy whom at present nobody is in a position to 
define.

  [Text] Domingo Cavallo has taken the first step in a 
campaign to encourage exports in order to reduce the trade 
balance deficit. Yesterday, the minister announced new credit 
lines to finance exports by small- and medium-sized companies. 
The amount available is $100 million at an annual interest rate 
of between 8 and 10 percent. 
  The minister used a meeting of the Argentine Industrial 
Union 
[UIA] to announce the plan. UIA President Jorge Blanco Villegas 
took advantage of the opportunity to lash out at bankers, who 
were absent from yesterday's meeting. He said they were "one of 
the main sectors missing from government economic reorganization 
programs." 
  The loans will be channeled through the Bank of Investment 
and Foreign Trade (BICE), which is presided over by Horacio 
Alvarez Rivero. The main points of this new credit line are: 

  -  The loan will finance up to 85 percent of the FOB value of 
capital good exports of national origin and up to 10 percent of 
the FOB value of spare parts and accessories. 
  -  The minimum loan 
is $20,000 and the maximum is $2.5 million per year. 
  -  The 
interest rate varies from 8 percent a year for shorter terms 
(from six months to two years) to 10 percent for longer terms 
(three to five years). 
  -  All financial institutions that operate 
trade internationally with the authorization of the BICE may 
play the role of commercial banks. The banks will get a maximum 
profit, or spread [preceding word in English] of 1.5 percent, 
which is already included in the rate. 
  -  The guarantees can be 
presented through an export credit insurance against special 
risks and regular commercial risks. The endorsement of foreign 
banks approved by the BICE can also be used. 
  Alvarez Rivero also presented a second line of credit to 
finance Argentine companies participation in international fairs 
and congresses. The idea is to cover up to 70 percent of the 
cost of renting stands, publishing catalogs, and paying for 
trips and hotels. 
  With this package -- in addition to the Competitivity Plan 
to 
be disclosed next week -- Cavallo seeks to stimulate exports. 
The 1993 trade deficit was over $3.5 billion. 
  Cavallo said: "We want all 1995 foreign trade activities to 
enjoy international financing." 
  Blanco Villegas, who is also the president of Philco, was 
skeptical about Cavallo's promises. He said: "I believe the 
financial sector has not made enough effort. We must exert 
pressure and stimulation to broaden credit and to reduce 
production costs." 
  The few businessmen who are members of the APYME [Small and 
Medium Enterprises Association] who came to hear the 
announcement were disappointed. One said: "This is not the 
first time we have heard announcements of this type." Workers 
of the INTI [National Institute of Industrial Technology] were 
also disappointed. They gathered outside to wait for the 
secretary of industry to protest the reorganization of this 
secretariat, but Carlos Magarinos did not attend the meeting 
because he is touring the country.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanish on 19 
March carries, on page 13, a 500-word article by Mariano Obarrio 
which notes that "the Interior Ministry did not officially 
comment on the attack on the Tucuman Congress building, although 
high-level officials are aware of the details of the incident." 
Interior Ministry Spokesman Julio Macchi explained, however, 
that it was a strictly provincial problem and that this ministry 
cannot interfere unless the provincial authorities ask. Macchi 
said that on 17 March Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf met with 
Tucuman Governor Ramon Ortega who commented that "the problem 
had been overcome." 
  The same page of this newspaper carries a 400-word article 
by 
Hector Domingo Padilla datelined San Miguel de Tucuman on the 
heated meeting held by Tucuman Congress during which the 
Executive Branch was held responsible for the attack on 17 
March. Prior to the session, which ended with a declaration 
voicing confidence that the corresponding investigations will be 
made and those responsible punished, "acting Provincial Congress 
President Mario Cristian Saracho was visited by a group of 
leaders of the regional CGT [General Confederation of Labor] who 
apologized for the recent incidents and expressed respect for 
the democratic regime." 
  On the same page is another 450-word unattributed report 
which notes that "while Tucuman Governor Ramon Ortega yesterday 
rejected charges by the opposition that the serious incidents 
caused by some 200 workers on 17 March against the provincial 
Congress building were a maneuver to intervene this body, the 
court ordered the arrest of Tucuman CGT Secretary General Miguel 
Brito and his secretary Luis Gonzalez for their alleged 
participation in the incident." Governor Ortega denied that the 
incident had political connotations like those in Santiago del 
Estero last December and commented that among the demonstrators 
were people who had nothing to do with La Florida Sugar Mill. 
  Buenos Aires PAGINA/12 on 19 March, on page 5, carries a 
550-word interview with Tucuman Governor Ramon Ortega by Hector 
Ali in San Miguel de Tucuman during which Ortega blurted out 
that "it is time legislators started to show courage and stopped 
seeking political profit from the peoples' needs and anguish." 
He notes that Tucuman's problem is quite different to the one 
in Santiago del Estero where public servants did not get paid 
for three consecutive months. He also refutes criticisms by 
Radical Legislator Gumersindo Parajon who said the incident was 
a maneuver to justify the intervention of Congress and added 
that he is not concerned about rumors that the riots are 
orchestrated in Buenos Aires in an attempt to thwart his 
intention to run as vice president.

<F P=106> [By Radical Civic Union leader Leopoldo Moreau] </F>
  [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Mar (NA) -- In some sectors the 
belief exists that the new Constitution favors Menem alone. 
This idea is shared both by the anti-Menem group -- who are 
emotionally against the constitutional reform -- and by 
government supporters, who enthusiastically believe that the 
reform will assure Menem a new presidential term. 
  Neither side is right. It is true that Menem could possibly 
run again in 1995. Yet it is also true that the hegemonic 
scheme of the Menem sector was left without reelection, and that 
thanks to the opportune and intelligent intervention of the 
Radical Civic Union [UCR], the dreams of the Menem sector to 
perpetuate arbitrariness, injustice, and corruption in power 
will collapse with the approval of the new Constitution. 
  Let us see why: 
  -- In the reform, the UCR managed to impose a strong 
restriction on Menem's reelection possibilities by introducing 
the indirect election of the president and the vice president 
(the electoral colleges will disappear) through the runoff 
system. This system, which will be established by the 
Constitution, may not be modified by a law. It definitively 
eliminates the danger of tricks to which the government might 
resort if it realizes it could lose an election. One of those 
tricks is the multiple ticket law. 
  The runoff election system will force Menem to obtain -- in 
order to avoid a runoff -- more than 45 percent of the votes in 
the first electoral round. It should be recalled that in its 
best electoral moment -- on 3 October 1993 -- the Menem sector 
barely received 42 percent of the votes. Furthermore, the 
runoff system favors the creation of two major electoral blocs: 
a pro-government bloc and an opposition bloc. So far there has 
been only one electoral front, the one formed by the Menem 
sector. With the traditional votes of the Justicialist Party, 
the UCEDE [Democratic Center Union], and other rightist sectors, 
this bloc was an apparently invincible electoral front. From 
now on this situation will change, and progressive and popular 
sectors will have a chance to create a strongly competitive 
electoral group. 
  -- The direct election of national senators, the reduction 
of 
their terms, and the designation of a third minority senator 
have destroyed the pro-Menem dream of controlling the Senate 
until the year 2003. 
  As a matter of fact, if everything had remained unchanged, 
or 
-- and this would have been even worse -- if the Constitution 
advocated by the government had been approved, instead of the 
one negotiated with the UCR, the pro-Menem sector, even in 
losing the elections, would have maintained control (by 
approximately two-thirds) over the Senate until the beginning of 
the next century. This circumstance has made people wonder: 
How will the opposition govern, if it wins the election, when 
the Menem sector has control over the Senate and a majority in 
the Supreme Court? 
  -- Millions of Argentines are right to wonder: How will it 
be possible to eradicate corruption without independent courts? 
Fighting corruption is not only an ethical obligation -- it is 
also a political duty. If the democratic system can find no 
efficient action to properly fight corruption, this will end up 
undermining the credibility of democracy. 
  The new Constitution negotiated by the UCR leadership, which 
is headed by Raul Alfonsin, has an answer for this dilemma. The 
system for designating and dismissing judges was totally 
modified. From now on, judges will no longer be designated by 
the president of the nation with Senate approval. The Senate 
has so far designated who would administer justice in secret 
sessions, and by majority vote. 
  With the new Constitution, judges will be nominated by the 
so-called Council for Magistrates (an organ made up of judges, 
delegates from bar associations and academic institutions, and 
lawmakers) which, after a qualification contest, will propose 
two- or three-name lists on which the Senate will have to debate 
in public sessions. 
  This system is operating in Italy, and based on its results 
in the fight against corruption within the government and in 
economic sectors, the system apparently works better than the 
one we have been using under the current Constitution. 
  Perhaps even more important is the modification of the 
system 
for dismissing corrupt judges. Under the current Constitution, 
the system for replacing judges has been highly inefficient. In 
50 years of institutional life -- before the Nicosia case -- 
only one judge has been dismissed through the impeachment system. 
  The Chamber of Deputies now needs a two-thirds majority to 
press charges against a judge, and the Senate needs a two-thirds 
vote to dismiss him. It is clear that with this method it is 
almost impossible to dismiss a judge. As an example, Dr. 
Servini de Cubria is still at her post. 
  The new Constitution drawn up by the UCR provides that 
suspected corrupt or unfit judges will be tried by a tribunal 
that will be similar to the Council for Magistrates, that is, 
its members will be judges, bar association representatives, 
academic institution representatives, and lawmakers. Some 
people will claim that it remains to be seen whether this system 
will work. Yet it is obvious that the current system does not 
work. 
  In addition to these rules, which the UCR introduced into 
the Constitution to assure a really independent judicial branch, 
there are other initiatives on which no consensus was reached 
but which were included at our request. If the UCR has the 
larger number of convention delegates it will be possible to 
approve such initiatives, which deal with the creation of the 
position of ombudsman and the subordination of the attorneys 
general to a sector outside the three branches of government. 
  The first initiative means that constitutional status will 
be 
given to an organ that will register reports and claims by any 
citizen of government or economic power abuse. Under the second 
initiative, the attorneys general (that is, the prosecutors) 
will no longer be subordinated to the executive branch (that is, 
to the government) or, as they are now, to the attorney general 
of the nation. This absurd situation has hindered many 
investigations into the work of public officials, causing honest 
judges to leave. 
  Finally, in order to improve control mechanisms -- to avoid 
corruption from grabbing people's money -- we have managed to 
make the new Constitution put the Office of the Comptroller 
General, which is the main control organ, in the hands of the 
main opposition party. This regulation will be definitively 
incorporated into our Constitution. 
  Another major conquest is the direct election -- that is, by 
voters -- of the mayor of the federal capital. There will be no 
more cases of designated mayors like former Buenos Aires Mayor 
Carlos Grosso. 
  Finally, UCR members will strive to make the new 
Constitution 
establish rules for a new type of relation between the nation 
and the provinces -- an issue that is being widely debated -- 
and rules to protect defenseless consumers from arbitrary 
actions of those who render privatized public services, or from 
unscrupulous people who at times even risk people's lives. 
These initiatives will certainly produce stronger rejection in 
the government, because they are against the philosophy of 
Menem's and Cavallo's economic concentration model. 
  We are then, beyond all doubt, facing a constitutional 
reform 
which even though giving Menem the possibility of running again, 
has managed to break his aspirations -- and the aspirations of 
the few economic power groups -- to perpetuate a model based on 
injustice, marginalization, and backwardness. 
  Despite all this, some fellow countrymen may still think 
that 
Menem should not have a chance of being reelected. We thought 
that Menemism is what should not be reelected. If it had not 
been Menem, we would have had to defeat Eduardo Duhalde or 
Domingo Cavallo. The difference is that the presidential term 
would have continued to be for six years, that there would have 
been a pro-Menem majority until the year 2003, that courts would 
not have changed, and that the people would have been unable to 
control the government. 
  In light of all this we say that Menemism, as a hegemonic 
model, has been left without reelection. Now Menem has to be 
defeated in the election. The people will make the decision. 
As we did more than 100 years ago, we have confidence in the 
people.

<F P=106> [Article by Ana Ale; all company name expansions unknown] </F>
  [Text] Bridas, the oil company owned by the Bulgheroni 
family, has won two bids for the exploitation of oil and gas in 
the former Soviet Union and is negotiating a third contract to 
drill 1,000 wells in Siberia. Meanwhile, Tecpetrol, of the 
Techint group, is looking for new opportunities. The two 
companies do not want to lose reserves that are abundant and 
cheap, particularly because the geological risk is minimal. The 
purpose of venturing into the former USSR extends beyond those 
borders though. The undertaking will allow them to build bridges 
to the coveted European market. 
  Business is promising in those latitudes and some Argentine 
oil companies went there in search of good and cheap reserves. 
Tecpetrol of the Techint group and Bridas have dared to 
challenge the former USSR's geography already, but other 
companies are ready to follow suit. 
  Both oil companies know that the first blow is half the 
battle. And even though Tecpetrol and Bridas agree on the 
philosophy of exploring new area, only Bridas closed an 
agreement with what today is called the Community of Independent 
States, which is still ranked among the top world producers. 
  Tecpetrol was very close to signing a contract but preferred 
to wait for the political climate to clear up a little more. The 
company still has a foot inside because Siderca, which is a 
group member, maintains an office here for the sale of seamless 
tubes. 
  Bridas learned of the existence of the reserves in 1985 when 
the mission was considered only a possible destination. They had 
to wait for the collapse of the former Soviet Union to take the 
next step. The slogan was: abundant resources at a low 
geological risk. The priorities were gas and Europe, the market 
for the sale of the fuel that contaminates the least. 
  Two years later they studied the area where this large 
reserve was located. In 1990 they had the folder with the 
project ready and a red cross on the map: The deposit went 
through Turkmenistan, on the Caspian Sea, and Iran. Here they 
found all the right conditions: little exploratory risk, 
facilities to export, a stable government, absence of ethnic 
problems, and a need for capital and technology. 
  Turkmenistan, the world's third-largest gas producer, 
organized bids for both gas and oil fields with conditions 
according to international standards. Bridas won two biddings. 
  -- In Yashlar, they and their American partners signed an 
exploration and development contract in which Turkmenistan had a 
25 percent participation. The company found gas in the first 
well, and if the estimates prove right, they will find in the 
area a volume of gas equal to all Argentina's reserves. 
  -- In Keimir, the contract involves oil exploration and 
exploitation, also with foreign partners. Turkmenistan 
participates in the consortium with 50 percent of the profits 
and spending. Today they are extracting 1,800 cubic meters of 
oil per day, which is equivalent to the mean production of 200 
Argentine wells. They also found gas, but the deposit is not 
developed yet. 
  The company might add another field in Russia. In that 
country the company won a private price bidding to drill 1,000 
wells in a Siberian oil field. But the issue of taxes is still 
being negotiated. 
  The high taxes temporarily scared Tecpetrol people from the 
area. Marcelo Martinez Mosquera and Jorge Viero (formerly with 
Bridas) visited the territory and traveled up to the Arctic. 
They made seven visits to Kazakhstan in Central Asia, the second 
largest former Soviet Republic. They almost participated in a 
bid there, but at the last moment officials changed the 
conditions and added taxes. The result was that no one 
participated. 
  Tecpetrol thinks the high political risk must be compensated 
for by a lot of profit. Because the conditions are not right 
yet, they returned and decided to expand in Latin America 
instead. 
  Bridas continues to look toward Moscow and its surroundings. 
The next gamble will be to build a gigantic gas pipeline if an 
agreement can be closed with Turkmenistan to export gas. The 
pipeline would cross Iran, Turkey, and Bulgaria, a long enough 
span to permit the company to enter the European market with 
firm steps.

  [Excerpts] Following the announcement of the arrival on 25 
March of a ship containing 530 tons of food products, a flood of 
reaction continues to rain down upon Signal FM. A group of four 
political parties made up of the National Cooperative Action 
Movement [MKN], the Democratic Movement for the Liberation of 
Haiti-Democratic Revolutionary Party of Haiti [MODELH-PRDH], the 
Bel-Air branch of the Movement for the Organization of the 
Country [MOP], and the Alliance for the Rebirth of Haiti [ARH] 
have rejected this humiliation that France would like to add to 
its sadism. France has pointed out that no people still under 
its hegemony have ever been brought to the brink of extinction 
because of the overthrow of a government. [passage omitted] 
  Certainly, Haiti has always hailed international aid 
provided 
as compensation within the framework of a world economic system 
biased in favor of the highly industrialized countries. In that 
regard, these parties recall that, far from making amends for 
the wrongs done to the race debased by slavery, France has held 
back the evolution of the Haitian people by requiring a very 
heavy payment for acknowledging the nation's independence. 
Nevertheless, the Haitian people have never needed charity from 
the descendants of the Leclercs and the Rochambeaus [French 
generals fought by Haitians during the War of Independence] -- 
conclude these political parties. 
  This press release is signed by Volvick Remy Joseph of MKN, 
attorney Francois Latortue of MODELH-PRDH, Greger Jean-Louis of 
the Bel-Air MOP, and Alex Dominique of ARH.

  [Text] In Haiti, a mobilization is being organized against 
the humanitarian aid from France. Several Haitian political 
organizations oppose the arrival of the French humanitarian aid, 
530 tons of food products sent by France for underprivileged 
Haitian students. The aid will be sent to Port-au-Prince by sea 
and is expected to arrive on 25 March. 
  FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of 
Haiti] member Emmanuel Constant calls the French initiative 
cynical. According to FRAPH, it constitutes trampling on Haitian 
pride; and FRAPH added, for the information of the French 
Government: You are starving an entire nation, just so you can 
later give alms to clear your conscience. 
  Another organization, Capois-La-Mort, supports the FRAPH 
position unreservedly. Capois-La-Mort leader Frank Pierre says 
no to the French humanitarian aid ship and takes the opportunity 
to denounce France's position. France has always demanded a 
total blockade against Haiti. 
  [Begin Pierre recording, in Creole] We in Capois-La-Mort are 
saying no, 9 times 99 times no! We will not have this 
humanitarian aid ship land in Haitian territorial waters. We are 
[hereby] sending the French Embassy in Haiti the message -- to 
be conveyed to President Francois Mitterrand of France -- that 
we in Capois-La-Mort will not have this ship entering Haitian 
territorial waters. Therefore, we ask President Mitterrand to 
stop this ship now, in Guadeloupe -- because the ship will just 
have to go right back to where it came from. It might as well 
even carry extra fuel, so that it does not stay even an hour 
longer in Haitian territory. [end recording] 
  On the other hand, ALAH [Alliance For the Liberation and 
Progress of Haiti] leader Reynold Georges has dissociated 
himself from the position taken by FRAPH and Capois-La-Mort. 
Georges thinks this French humanitarian aid could help prevent 
the death of children in Haiti. 
  [Begin Georges recording, in Creole] If a country feels it 
cannot let the Haitian people die of hunger and wants to offer 
some aid, I believe we must accept the aid -- because there is 
no glory in death. I believe that the aid must come, otherwise 
many children will die; and I think the reason those people 
would prefer that the aid not arrive is because they want to 
capitalize on the death of those children. 
  We think the aid should come. If not, then FRAPH should give 
it! Along with all the other people who continue to support the 
coup d'etat -- because since 1986 the Army has been choosing the 
governments and then overthrowing them [end recording]. 
  Attorney Mireille Durocher Bertin opposes the arrival of the 
French humanitarian aid. [Begin Durocher 
recording]...consciously and categorically refuse humanitarian 
aid however derisory it may be, if it can prevent even a single 
child from dying of hunger. However, we must, it is our duty 
to, protest against the hypocrisy of certain nations that, after 
strangling us, seem to supply us with a slight breath of air for 
an artificial, false, derisory, temporary resuscitation. 
  When France -- which is still calling for tightening the 
economic sanctions against Haiti -- says that it wants to feed 
50,000 children for four months, I would like to ask France: 
What will happen to the other millions of children that it is 
starving? 
  They want to reduce us to our simplest expression, on the 
pretext of imposing on us, with Mr. Aristide's return, a 
so-called democracy. 
  France wants to punish its former rebellious colony and use 
it as an example to the other black nations. If they really want 
to help the women and children of Haiti, they should stop 
interfering in our internal affairs. [end recording]

illegal activities occurring within the scope of an alleged

  [Text] Mexico City, 22 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Manuel Camacho 
Solis, government commissioner for peace and reconciliation in 
Chiapas, denied today that he seeks to be a presidential 
candidate in the upcoming 21 August general elections. 
  Local newspaper reports had reported the possibility that 
Camacho might be one of the contenders in view of his primary 
role in the Chiapas peace process and that political analysts 
had included him in the list of "presidential hopefuls." 
  "The decision I am making might disappoint some people, but 
I 
am certain that they would reproach me if I were to place any 
other interest above the topic of peace," Camacho stated in 
statements to newsmen. He also dismissed the possibility of 
occupying a Senate seat and said he will dedicate his efforts to 
peace in Chiapas, where an armed group occupied several towns 
and attacked a garrison early this year, prompting the Mexican 
Army to step in. 
  Camacho was appointed by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
as commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas on 10 
January. After intense negotiations he achieved a preliminary 
agreement which will be analyzed by the government and the armed 
group. 
  "Without this (political) definition, it would be difficult 
to continue my work in favor of peace in Chiapas," Camacho 
added. His position is independent of the government [words 
indistinct] refusal to participate in the elections. The 
commissioner noted that "if it is noted that my priorities 
include being a presidential candidate, it could harm the peace 
process" in Chiapas where over 100 persons were killed. 
  Some 42 million voters, a little less than half of the 
country's population, will go to the polls on 21 August to elect 
a new president, new deputies, and part of the Senate. 
  The candidates in the elections will be Luis Donaldo Colosio 
of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, Diego Fernandez 
de Cevallos of the National Action Party, and Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas of the Party of the Democratic Revolution. There are 
two female candidates: Cecilia Soto of the Labor Party and 
Marcela Lombardo of the Popular Socialist Party. Other hopefuls 
are Rafael Aguilar of the Cardenist Front for National 
Reconstruction Party, Pablo Emilio Madero of the National 
Opposition National Union, Alvaro Perez of the Authentic Party 
of the Mexican Revolution, and Jorge Gonzalez of the Ecologist 
Party of Mexico.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate for the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, commented in Culiacan on 22 
March on the statement by Mr. Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner 
for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. 
  [Begin Colosio recording] Many of you have asked me for my 
reaction to today's public statement by Manuel Camacho Solis, so 
I have written a communique that I want to read to you. I will 
begin by saying that Camacho Solis' public statement confirms 
his absolute devotion to the tasks of conciliation and 
pacification with which the president entrusted him, thus 
confirming that our government has undertaken in earnest the 
construction of a lasting peace in Chiapas. It also recalls 
that the path to creating the conditions necessary to uproot the 
problem is still a complex one. The problem has caused so much 
suffering for Mexicans that handling it allows no room for 
distractions, as the commendable work by Camacho demonstrates. 
In my opinion, unity among Mexicans must prevail to 
successfully face the Chiapas problem. Everyone must act in 
solidarity with those who are striving to achieve that purpose. 
As I have said on other occasions and as I reiterate today, 
Camacho Solis is the best man to build a just peace in Chiapas 
because of his convictions, sensitivity, and negotiating 
ability. Camacho Solis is a man of great ability and political 
commitment who has performed outstanding services for the 
country and will continue to do so. I am certain that all 
Mexicans will widely commend the successful conclusion of the 
negotiations in Chiapas, as we regard national unity and peace 
as the nation's path to progress. 
  As for us, we will continue onward with our proposal for 
unity, the future, renewal, and the hope of a freer and more 
just Mexico. The options are clear: Ours consists of a proposal 
for a broad center, for the future, for democracy, and for 
greater justice for all regions of our country, in all its 
diversity and pluralism, so we can advance in the change the 
people truly want. The other proposals belong to the past: a 
past of statism, bureaucracy, inefficiency, irresponsibility, 
populism, pessimism, acrimony, and resentment. Other proposals 
represent an even more remote past, a past of privilege. They 
only manage to offer government by the few for the few. 
Because Mexico has changed and continues to change, we will 
lead the country to the future it deserves by recognizing the 
state's new role: the power of reform, strengthening federalism 
and the balance of power with stability, and, most of all, with 
the priority objective of bringing more justice and welfare to 
the nation. In view of the above, I am today calling on all 
Mexicans who support my proposal to join the campaign. I call on 
you to join with conviction and enthusiasm. I am particularly 
calling on those who hold a strong conviction for democratic 
change and wish to promote a new consensus to transform the 
country. I call on you to unite and join this program I have 
proposed for the nation. 
  There is room for you in this campaign for the future. There 
will be room, opportunities, and tasks to help reinforce the 
nation for you in the government that we will win 
democratically. The new organizations of society, the citizen 
who is now seeking to contribute to the actions of a new 
constructive and tolerant policy, should know that you will find 
in me the firmest support now and in the years of toil we have 
ahead to make Mexico great. Thank you. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Acting Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno spoke 
today in Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of Chiapas, about the Chiapas 
electoral process scheduled for 21 August and the presidential 
elections that will be held throughout the country. Lopez 
Moreno said conditions have forced authorities to reschedule 
Chiapas gubernatorial elections two months after the previously 
scheduled date. He warned, however, that there will not be 
another acting governor in the state because the people are 
against it. 
  Juan Carlos Antollo was in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas this 
morning. He is now back in San Cristobal de las Casas, one hour 
from the Chiapas capital, and filed this report on what is 
happening in Chiapas. Good evening, Juan Carlos, how are you? 
  [Antollo] Good evening. After traveling a road with 326 
curves and three straight segments, we made it to San Cristobal 
de las Casas, Chiapas. As you pointed out, it was said today 
that there will be no more acting governments in this state. It 
was decided that the gubernatorial elections, which some 
proposed be postponed until 1995, will be held this year in 
October. This will guarantee that the transition of state 
executives is made within the timeframes established by the 
Chiapas Constitution. 
  Chiapas Government Secretary Pablo Salazar Mendicoechea made 
the aforementioned statements while disclosing a report that 
Governor Javier Lopez Moreno will send to the Chiapas Congress. 
Salazar Mendicoechea said the governor held a series of 
meetings throughout the state during which it was decided that 
this year's gubernatorial elections would be held in October 
instead of 1995. The document added: This decision was made 
because right now the state is facing difficult situations. If 
these situations are indeed taking place, however, the electoral 
process should go on as mandated by law. 
  [Begin Moreno recording] For this particular occasion, we 
propose that the gubernatorial elections be held on Sunday, 16 
October. The local deputy and mayoral elections will be held as 
scheduled in August 1995. No more acting governors will be 
appointed because most Chiapas residents are against that. 
There will be new electoral legislation that will allow 
equality in political campaigns, new prerogatives for parties, 
reliability in electoral organizations, and credibility in the 
results. [end recording] [passage omitted]

Revolutionary Committee-General Command of the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army to the State Council of Indian and Peasant 
Organizations from "southeastern Mexico" on 19 March] 
  [Text] To the State Council of Indian and Peasant 
Organizations (CEOIC), all honest Indian and peasant 
organizations of Mexico, the Mexican people, brothers: 
  The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General 
Command of the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army], 
respectfully requests that you accept this humble greeting from 
our fighters in the mountains of southeastern Mexico. 
  We raised our weapons and our faces to tell the usurping 
government that we are tired of so many lies. They have sold us 
a big farce all these years. Now they want to crown it with a 
humiliating peace. We don't want it; we have known that peace 
for over 500 years. We know what it costs and the scant 
benefits it reaps for our territory and our people. Those who 
were never here now want to come to our mountain, to buy us with 
handouts in exchange for leaving our brothers of other lands and 
colors. They want to buy our struggle and our blood with 
remnants of justice, handouts of liberty, and promises of 
democracy. 
  We want to greet you, we the smaller and faceless ones, we 
want to ask that since you are there in front of the arrogant 
palace of the usurper and the bad government, to please tell 
them that the Zapatists do not sell themselves. The Zapatists 
do not betray anyone and do not surrender. Explain what it is 
to be a Zapatist to the bad government. Clear up their doubts; 
cry out with us to tell all the truths; take up our voice, 
brothers, to speak to all Mexicans. Tell them that to our will 
for peace the supreme government responds with war signals, that 
it raises lies to our truths, that it continues to arrest us 
unfairly, that it continues to fill its prisons with Indians, 
that bloodletting continues in our territory. Brothers, the 
government lies! It continues its war against our cause. The 
whiteness of their hands is false, because it is stained with 
the blood of our brothers. 
  Indian brothers of these Mexican lands, poor peasants who 
are 
rich in honor and dignity, accept this step of ours so far from 
the cities and laurels, receive our greetings, fill your hearts 
with our song. Hear us brothers, we speak from the mountains. 
Take your voices to those who have nothing. Let all of the 
Mexican territory rise up. 
  Greetings, brothers of CEOIC! Greetings, Indian brothers! 
Greetings, Mexican brothers! Liberty! Justice! Democracy! 
  Respectfully, from southeastern Mexico, the Clandestine 
Indian Revolutionary Committee-General Command of the EZLN. 
  Mexico, March 1994. 
  [Signed] Rebel Subcommander Marcos

<F P=106> [Commentary by historian and Chiapas specialist Antonio </F>
Garcia de Leon: "Chiapas: Insurrection Encourages New Conflicts"] 
  [Text] The most recent events in Chiapas indicate that the 
initial armed rebellion has turned into a broader, more 
peaceful, and more widespread civil insurrection that does, 
however, create a complex scenario of dangers and intermediate 
actors. The attacks on newsmen and the lynching threats against 
the university caravan are just the most visible element of a 
tense plot that could drive the entire region into a new theater 
of combat. First, the shock wave of the initial explosion, which 
has not yet faded, evidenced the regional (and national) absence 
of the rule of law and even of a state apparatus that could take 
responsibility for solving problems. In this context it is very 
significant that Don Samuel Ruiz is sought after today by 
Indians, peasants, and workers all over the country as an 
intermediary in dealing with a government that has been 
conspicuous by its absence or that simply fails to acknowledge 
its responsibility to anyone. This is even more significant 
because one of the government's tactics has been to set up 
several "autonomous commissions" and "consensus-building boards" 
that are substituting for already existing institutions and that 
will supposedly help to ease the conflict and to develop, at 
last, sectoral solutions for ethnic groups around the country. 
  A sort of honeymoon period of civil liberalization and 
rebirth inspired from below was created regionally in this 
vacuum. The new context evidenced the nature of the 
authoritarian regime, the true essence of regional cacique 
power, which has been sustained for several years from the 
center and has been embodied in the PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] governors, the chiefs of small groups that 
have broken every law and laid waste to Chiapas at their whim. 
The spontaneous municipal revolt (which has now spread to a 
third of the state's municipalities), the teachers' rebellion, 
the protests by the employees of several services, the blockades 
of creditor banks and roads, the takeovers of ranches and large 
and mid-sized landholdings in Chilon, Simojovel, and elsewhere, 
and widespread civil disobedience, etc., have now created an 
environment of change that has exposed the parallel structures 
of the State in Chiapas: complicity and corruption, the partisan 
contracts awarded to several cabinet secretaries (among them, 
the construction firms of the Zedillo Ponce de Leon family), the 
indiscriminate looting of public coffers during the 
administrations of Castellanos and Gonzalez Garrido, the 
fraudulent dummy companies, the systematic violation of human 
rights, and in particular the existence of a complex array of 
armed parapolice groups in the city and the countryside (the 
so-called "white guards") that receive weapons, training, 
protection, and even lands from the state and federal government 
and that derive at times from the very disintegration of the 
peasant movement, which has accelerated over the past three or 
four years. 
  Chiapas once again seems to be a boiling cauldron whose 
special hue colors all of the forces that are remodeling 
themselves there. The sudden emergence of a dissatisfied 
citizenry is also a relatively new phenomenon (although it does 
have powerful forerunners in the 19th and early 20th century), 
because "civil society" there has expressed itself over the past 
20 years almost exclusively through the peasant movement and 
certain fiercely persecuted opposition newspapers. The weakness 
of this emerging civil society, which lacks mediating sectors 
between the peasants and the State apparatus, which is far 
removed from civic-electoral matters, and which is just barely 
beyond the control of the State party and its elaborate 
networks, also explains some of the fragility of the new 
balances. Paradoxically as well, the strong and recurring 
peasant social movement reflects the entire range of hopes and 
dangers and very possibly foreshadows the scenarios of the 
immediate future; all of the paradoxes and contradictions of 
Chiapas society are mirrored in it. 
  We can say today that the peasant movement, which has 
regrouped around the 280 associations that make up the State 
Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations (CEOIC), has a very 
diverse makeup, as no more than 14 organizations in it truly go 
beyond the local or municipal level. And although its components 
range from simple cooperatives and production units (and several 
sham groups) to more or less independent regional organizations 
and three overtly official ones, they all have in common a 
treatment of political matters that is a factor today in the 
movement's structural weakness and in several immediate dangers. 
It is on this weakness that the corporative control of the old 
PRI mainly rested, lubricated in recent years by the economic 
disbursements of Pronasol [National Solidarity Program]. As a 
result, the bridges that could link this widespread movement to 
the civic-electoral arena and thus allow for the honest election 
of a civilian governor of Chiapas do not, in fact, exist today. 
The two basic currents that began it, the radical leftist 
organizations of the 1970's and the so-called Mass Line, have 
come together here to reject a political-electoral approach. The 
former feel that such a struggle is "bourgeois" or a losing 
cause from the outset against the backdrop of a "farce." The 
latter are deliberately disregarding politics so that they can 
pursue what they have called the "policy of the two faces" (or 
the thousand masks), which consists of turning the peasant 
economic movement over to the networks of official 
"consensus-building," financial corruption, and the captive, 
corporative PRI vote. When the Salinas administration took 
office, some of the local advisers to the latter became 
second-rank federal officials of Pronasol, Sedesol [Secretariat 
for Social Development], or the CNC [National Peasant 
Confederation] and established their control over the official 
part of the Chiapas peasant movement: Peasant-Teacher Solidarity 
(Socama), ARIC [Rural Associations of Collective Interest]-Union 
of Unions, and to a lesser extent, the state CNC. 
  It is for these and other reasons that in recent days the 
CEOIC has become one of the hubs of the Chiapas problem in 
discussions and battles between those who are calling for an 
independent, unified peasant movement and those who are trying 
once again to yoke the entire movement (as if nothing had 
happened) to the networks of the State apparatus, of the 
Permanent Agrarian Council (CAP), of the ruling party, and of 
the "advisers" of PRI and Pronasol. For the time being, in spite 
of opposition by the majority, attempts have been made to 
overturn peasant support for the besieged Zapatists 
(unconditional backing by the main Indian groups in the CEOIC 
for the EZLN [Zapatist Army of National Liberation]). Efforts 
have also been made to thwart the "plan of action" of protests, 
marches, rallies, peaceful takeovers, and widespread resistance 
and to legitimize in the CEOIC's eyes the presence of advisers 
to President Salinas de Gortari (such as Javier Gil of UNORCA 
[National Union of Autonomous Regional Peasant Organizations] 
and of the CAP) or to bring in as leaders of the process the 
"Three Wise Men" of the "autonomous" commission (appointed, but 
of course, by Salinas and Gonzalez Garrido on 8 January): writer 
Eraclio Zepeda, Patrocinist [partisan of Patrocinio Gonzalez 
Garrido] anthropologist Andres Fabregas, and Castellanist 
[partisan of former Governor Absalon Castellanos] Senator 
Eduardo Robledo, who is also seeking the PRI nomination for 
state governor. 
  In this context, the nascent CEOIC, which has achieved a 
fleeting unity that would have been unthinkable before the 
explosion (inasmuch as the movement was seriously divided and at 
odds), would paradoxically be the "natural base" of support for 
rebuilding PRI domination in Chiapas. The philanthropic ogre is 
thus endeavoring to lead its "favorite sons," the peasants of 
Chiapas, once again down the sinuous pathways of the "Laberinto 
de la Pronasoledad" [Labyrinth of Pronasolitude]. 
  The promises of loans and aid of all kinds, the control of 
some leaders, the promotional roundup and transporting of people 
to the presidential residence, Los Pinos, Sedesol's gift of 10 
vans to the CEOIC, and many other promises and traps are already 
being strewn in the path of this nascent organization, this 
brand-new grass-roots alliance that will have to become one of 
the guarantors of a local transition to democracy. Nevertheless, 
most of the groups that make up the CEOIC (the rank and file 
much more than their advisers), including the battered state 
CNC, are still alerting domestic and international public 
opinion "to prevent the CEOIC from becoming another of the 
instruments of control and manipulation that the federal and 
state governments are using to avoid addressing the real causes 
of the social, political and military violence that is wounding 
Chiapas and the country." (LA JORNADA, 16 February 1994, p 14) 
  If the horizon were to become even more cloudy and if the 
fancy footwork that the Salinas advisers are doing were to be 
successful (once again plugging up the hole that the 
insurrection has opened up in society), some of today's clouds 
could turn stormy and develop into extremely dangerous 
situations, such as a turbulent regional civil war. This depends 
on the evolution of the State's two policies towards the 
conflict: the mediation of Manuel Camacho Solis, on the one 
hand, and the political-military siege of the insurgents, on the 
other. The former policy is weakened by the fact that it binds 
only the current government (and the Executive Branch more than 
the subordinate Legislature and Judiciary), which also has just 
a few months of nominal power left. It is constrained by the 
fact that the meager legal representativeness of the "mediator" 
and the EZLN could turn the negotiations into mere "sessions." 
The latter could turn into a structural solution that in the 
long run would lead to a low-intensity counterinsurgency that 
would seek to involve the communities in the highlands and the 
forest, especially after a military assault on the regions 
controlled by the rebels. 
  This scenario, unfortunately, is not being ruled out and is 
already to be seen in several respects: the tightening of the 
military siege and the creation of the 38th Military Zone in 
Tenosique; the erratic, irresponsible actions of the government 
of Absalon Castellanos's former education secretary, Javier 
Lopez Moreno (appointed from the center, like his corrupt 
predecessors and accomplices); the traditional repression of the 
civilian insurrectionists in the municipalities; Los Pinos 
support for the traditional caciques; and the false promises to 
"audit" the humblest representatives of a true Mafia (the mayors 
and lower-level officials), without even trying to do anything 
about the widespread impunity of the State apparatus in the 
region (it has always enjoyed a complete, permanent amnesty). 
  The greatest danger, however, looms in the regions in 
conflict, in which the Salinas administration has not renounced 
violence as a solution. The forerunner of the future 
counterinsurgent "civil patrols" (which resemble the ones that 
are laying waste to the Guatemalan countryside today) was 
created in Ocosingo in 1992 to deal with the agrarian insecurity 
prompted by the ongoing invasions of ranches and estates. Called 
the "Citizen Defense Unions," they were armed and trained, 
according to the ranchers themselves, by the Federal Army and 
can already claim several evictions and assaults, as well as 
prior confrontations with the Zapatists. The next step can be 
seen coming: using the official peasant organizations in the 
forest region, especially the ARIC-Union of Unions (which is 
bitter over the support of several of "its" communities for the 
Zapatists) to provoke confrontations, to create an unpopulated 
corridor by relocating refugees, to intone official propaganda 
(which would be pro-peasant and pro-Indian) against the rebels, 
to administer the new disbursements of Pronasol, and to 
manipulate the displaced persons (as the pro-PRI ranchers in 
Altamirano, Ocosingo, and Las Margaritas have already done). All 
of these actions would pave the way for the final "siege and 
annihilation" of the rebels by the Federal Army. 
  There is still time to prevent such a scenario if the 
government acts in good faith, if the peace negotiations pan 
out, if intelligent, creative actions are taken (a democratic 
opening, participation of all parties and forces in a new social 
pact, comprehensive agrarian reform...), and if the basic 
premise is that we are looking at a radically new situation. But 
if the Federal Government remains "tied up in knots" and thinks 
only about the partisan interests of the small "interest group" 
and its multimillionaire sponsors or if it continues to act as 
it has, perpetuating landowner domination of Chiapas and the 
wild-eyed centralism and presidentialism of the president and 
his friends, who have done so much harm to the country (in a 
word, the ignoble peace before the explosion), then we will be 
hurtling towards a precipice that could engulf the country in 
violence for several years. 
  As the rebels have been proclaiming since 1 January and the 
citizens of the entire country have been proclaiming for some 
time now, a solution to the Chiapas conflict is possible only 
through a true national transition to democracy. Political 
parties, which have been overtaken by events, must realize that 
the fate of the entire nation is at stake in Chiapas and that it 
is not just some minor obstacle on the campaign trail. It is 
that easy and that difficult.

  [Excerpt] Culiacan Rosales, Sinaloa, 17 Mar -- Agriculture 
and Hydraulic Resources Secretary Carlos Hank Gonzalez has 
cautioned, "Mexico must become self-sufficient in food because 
it would be very dangerous to have to depend on another country, 
even if it is a friendly country." The secretary issued this 
warning during his speech at the ceremony in which Jorge Kondo 
Lopez, a state leader of the Federation of Agricultural 
Associations of Sinaloa State, presented his second work report. 
  Hank said, "Self-sufficiency in food means producing what is 
necessary to feed our country." He recalled that four years 
ago, Mexico had to import beans, and that this was very 
difficult to do because of international shortages. 
  He said: "We do not want the country swamped with foreign 
products; we must import only what we need." He said that 
although at this moment it is advantageous to import basic 
materials, machinery, and seeds, the ideal situation would be to 
not require any imports. [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 22 
March. 
  According to a 1993 Mexican Petroleum (Pemex) report, Mexico 
is willing to sell its entire stock of crude exports to the 
United States as long as U.S. market prices for Mexican oil are 
best for the country. In 1993, Mexico sent almost two-thirds of 
all the oil it sold abroad to the U.S. market. The nation's 
overall income from oil and petroleum products in 1993 was 
$5.992 billion. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 21 Mar 94 p 
15) 
  Mexico's oil reserves decreased between 3.5 and 4 percent in 
1993. Nevertheless, the decline was not as sharp as in previous 
years. Pemex Director Francisco Rojas announced at ceremonies 
marking the 56th anniversary of the Mexican oil industry's 
nationalization that Mexico currently has oil reserves of 64.769 
billion barrels. Energy industry sources say the decrease in 
the reserves resulted from meager investments in the exploration 
and production of oil, despite the discovery of new deposits. 
(Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 18 Mar 94 p 19) 
  Pemex Director Francisco Rojas says oil production in Mexico 
declined last year by 14 percent. Rojas attributed the decline 
to the "worst cyclical depression ever experienced by the 
petrochemical industry worldwide and Mexico's economic 
recession." President Carlos Salinas de Gortari spoke at the 
same event -- the 56th anniversary of the Mexican oil industry's 
nationalization. He reiterated that "oil is a strategic 
resource for our great nation and will continue to be the 
exclusive property of the Mexican people." Salinas added that 
oil has remained a nonnegotiable point in NAFTA. (Hamburg DPA 
in Spanish 0037 GMT 19 Mar 94) 
  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has announced in 
Tlaxcala 
that the National Foreign Trade Bank and the Secretariat of 
Commerce and Industrial Development, Secofi, will redouble its 
efforts to allow more medium-sized and small businesses to enter 
the North American, Central American, and European export 
markets. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 
GMT 12 Mar 94) 
  Fernando Heftye, Secofi's director of foreign investments, 
says that through February foreign investments in Mexico 
amounted to just over $4 billion, which could increase to $15 
billion by year's end. Heftye said at least 20 countries are 
interested in signing bilateral agreements to protect and 
promote investment but that a formal negotiations process has 
not been initiated. Among the countries interested, he said, 
are Germany, Great Britain, Switzerland, Italy, and Spain. 
(Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 17 Mar 94 pp 1, 6) 
  Jacques Lecomte, European Union, EU, ambassador to Mexico, 
says Mexico's exports to Europe decreased by 17 percent in 1993 
because of the economic recession in the region. This decline 
in sales also slowed the Mexican economy and fostered 
uncertainty among Mexican businessmen prior to the signing of 
NAFTA. Lecomte said the EU has not conducted studies on the 
impact NAFTA will have on the EU-Mexican trade balance, but, he 
added, telecommunications will be among the most adversely 
affected areas. Lecomte concluded that the European countries 
would like to increase their exports to Mexico. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 0242 GMT 16 Mar 94) 
  French Ambassador to Mexico Paul Dijou says French investors 
and bankers would like to establish themselves in Mexico because 
NAFTA has made it a strategic point for investments. They are 
considering opening branches or establishing partnerships with 
Mexican banks. Dijou toured Puebla State to sign technological 
cooperation agreements with the Autonomous University of Puebla. 
(Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0148 GMT 16 Mar 94) 
  Mexico's industrialization process has remained at a 
standstill over the past 13 years. Today, high technology 
exports total 60 percent of the country's total exports. 
Mexico's participation in the international market with 
sophisticated technical equipment is limited by the industrial 
underdevelopment in Latin America. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO 
in Spanish 16 Mar 94 p 3A) 
  The nation's airlines are not ready to deal with the 
increased shipping of merchandise under NAFTA. Domestic cargo 
service by domestic airlines decreased 3.8 percent over the past 
two years, while foreign airlines increased their cargo services 
by 30 percent over the same period. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO 
in Spanish 16 Mar 94 p 21) 
  EL FINANCIERO conducted an economic analysis based on Bank 
of 
Mexico information that shows prices of nearly one-third of the 
basic food basket staples increased at an annual rate of 11.2 
percent in January -- a rate 3.7 percent above the national 
inflation index for consumer prices. Increases in the prices of 
corn meal, cookies, rice, oats, powdered milk, margarine, and 
other items all contributed to lowering the people's purchasing 
power. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 17 Mar 94 p 3A)

  [Excerpt] Sao Paulo Prefect Paulo Maluf told the leadership 
of the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] yesterday that he will be 
a presidential candidate in the elections to replace President 
Itamar Franco. "I will be a candidate, I will leave the 
prefecture on 30 March and I expect everyone's help" said Maluf 
during a three-hour meeting in his house in Sao Paulo. Maluf 
seeks to end the pressure from friends and relatives not to run 
for president. 
  Senator Esperidiao Amin (SC) [Santa Catarina], national 
president of the PPR, made the announcement. He said: "I am 
convinced Maluf will be our presidential candidate." A good 
part of the meeting was used to evaluate the studies of Maluf's 
electoral possibilities and of the PPR candidates for state 
governors. 
  One point emphasized by Maluf was the concentration of his 
support, as shown in the polls, in the middle, lower middle, and 
lower classes of the population which cover the largest part of 
the electorate. The evaluation of the PPR is that Finance 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party] who would be Maluf's direct competitor in a 
second round would have problems getting the votes of the poor.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] There are more statements by Prosecutor General de 
Greiff, who was unruffled by the U.S. announcement of a possible 
suspension of judicial cooperation with Colombia. 
  Although the Governments of the United States and Colombia 
have not made official the suspension of aid or the exchange of 
judicial evidence, the prosecutor general noted that if the 
warning is carried out his office will continue to try the 
narcotraffickers with the evidence that it gathers. 
  [Begin recording] [De Greiff] Nobody benefits. Nobody 
benefits from a lack of evidence exchange or a lack of 
cooperation. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Who stands to lose the most or what 
happens? 
  [De Greiff] I believe that the United States stands to lose 
the most. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Prosecutor, who do you think is -- let us 
speak honestly -- trying to trip you up? 
  [De Greiff] Ask the government. 
  [Reporter] Do you think it is necessary to reform the law on 
criminal proceedings again? 
  [De Greiff] I think that no foreign country has the right to 
indicate to another one how to dictate its laws. That is the 
mission of the legislators. [end recording] 
  [Earlier in this same "24 Hours Newscast" Santa Fe de Bogota 
Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish at 0000 GMT on 23 
March also carries a three-minute report on press agency reports 
that the United States may suspend judicial cooperation with 
Colombia and U.S. State Department sources claiming there is 
very little behind these rumors. Colombian Embassy sources said 
that future cooperation is being assessed and "whether material 
would be given to the office of Prosecutor General de Greiff in 
the future." In a recording, when asked about this issue 
Colombian Foreign Minister Neomi Sanin said: "Colombia has a 
sovereign and independent policy. It has its own foreign policy 
that is respected by all countries of the hemisphere."]

  [Text] The Hague, 21 Mar (EFE) -- The Dutch news agency ANP 
in Paramaribo has reported that members of a guerrilla group 
seized the hydroelectric plant in Afobaka hours ago and they are 
currently holding 30 hostages. 
  According to an unidentified spokesman of the group called 
the "Liberation Front of Suriname," access roads to the 
hydroelectric plant have been mined in a 7-km radius. The 
hydroelectric dam supplies energy to the country's capital, 
located 100 km to the north. 
  According to ANP, the guerrilla group is holding 30 
employees 
of Suralco, a bauxite company, hostage and they are demanding a 
"decentralization of power" and the resignation of the 
Surinamese Government.

<F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Text] One of the changes in top positions within the 
security forces is the appointment of Salvador Figueroa, the new 
director of the National Police. This has all occurred at a 
time at which the United States insists on classifying Guatemala 
as a country that is risky for foreign tourists. Regarding this 
matter, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has said: 
  [Begin De Leon Carpio recording] This is something that has 
not really been defined yet. The travel advisory has not really 
been established yet. What they have said is that a warning was 
issued because of the problem with stealing children, the 
smuggling of minors, and other illegal activities involving 
Guatemalan children. It is exclusively for that reason. It is 
exclusively for the United States because somehow some U.S. 
individual was involved. A travel advisory has not been 
officially established. 
  On the contrary, I read an interview with the Guatemalan 
president in THE MIAMI HERALD today. Comments on this were 
completely favorable, especially those by the executive director 
who was here for the Inter-American Press Association meeting. 
He spoke about the advantages of Guatemalan tourism. 
  So those reports are not true. There has been some 
exaggeration on this topic, not here but abroad, specifically in 
the United States. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada promulgated the capitalization law yesterday. It becomes 
effective upon its publication in the official gazette. 
  The sore point is that the opposition has filed, or will do 
in the next few hours, a petition with the Supreme Court to 
declare the law unconstitutional. The problem is one of 
interpretation. 
  [Begin recording] [Deputy Edil Sandoval] The petition of 
unconstitutionality is presented against resolutions that 
violate the Constitution or affect the interests of one or more 
individuals. If the Supreme Court admits the petition, which I 
do not believe it will, and decides in favor of the petition, 
such decision will only benefit those who signed the petition. 
Therefore, in the worst of cases the decision will not 
invalidate the law. [passage omitted] 
  [Deputy Carlos Borth] The Constitution also grants deputies 
the right to make this type of petitions in special cases. Let 
us recall that the capitalization law regulates the transfer of 
five enterprises to the private sector. We, the MIR [Movement 
of the Revolutionary Left], will specifically oppose the 
transfer of YPFB [Bolivian Government Oil Deposit] [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

U.S. President William Clinton said he will not lift the 
blockade on Cuba. During the dinner, Clinton seemed worried 
about the fact that he will have to testify again before the 
special prosecutor in the Whitewater case. [Former] Judge David 
Hale had said that through transactions Clinton provided some 
$100,000 to the Whitewater company, through which Clinton and 
his wife Hilary owned some properties when Clinton was governor 
of Arkansas.

  [Text] Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen stated that his 
country is willing to go on without trade relations with the 
United States if Washington continues to condition its 
preferential status of bilateral trade on the domestic policies 
issues of the PRC. In an interview published today in the NEW 
YORK TIMES newspaper, Qian Qichen criticized the U.S. policy of 
setting the deadline of July 1994 on China's most favored nation 
status in trade with the United States if Beijing does not make 
progress in the observation of human rights. 
  It is important to remember that according to the very UN 
Human Rights Commission charter, the fulfilling of all its 
clauses are determined by the domestic and sovereign laws of 
each state.

<F P=106> [Report by Eloisa Ibarra A.] </F>
  [Excerpts] The chief of the Armed Forces has testified for 
the first time in connection with the Jean Paul Genie case, 
after refusing to go before a civilian judge and three and a 
half years later. As you may recall, Jean Paul Genie's death 
occurred on 28 October 1990 at approximately 2045 on the highway 
to Masaya, when the young man reportedly tried to pass General 
Humberto Ortega's motorcade. A barrage of bullets riddled the 
young man's body killing him instantly. Fifty-two cartridge 
shells were found where he was killed. 
  Ortega, wearing military garb, arrived at the Army's Public 
Relations Office where he had been summoned by Dr. Lester Gallo, 
the military prosecutor in charge of the investigation. Shortly 
before testifying, as requested by the accusers who were 
represented by Dr. Daniel Olivas Zuniga, Ortega read a 
12-paragraph public letter establishing his position on the 
events that are currently under investigation. [passage omitted] 
  The Public Relations Office room where the Genie trial is 
being held was too small for the number of local and 
international journalists who covered the general's statements. 
Once Ortega sat in the defendant's seat, he had to answer the 
customary questions everyone involved in a trial is asked: where 
he was and what he was doing at the time of the crime. 
  Ortega, like all of his personal bodyguards charged with the 
crime, told the judge, defense, and prosecution lawyers he was 
at home on the night of the crime. Ortega said he went to 
Colonel Lenin Cerna's house that evening but Cerna was not home 
because he was out of the country. He then went to the general 
command where he stayed until he went home. He got home early in 
the evening.

<F P=106> [Report by Hermes Sucre Serrano] </F>
  [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares of the PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party] and Ruben Dario Carles of "Change '94" 
remain the leading candidates in terms of voter preference, 
while Mireya Moscoso de Gruber of the Arnulfist Party [PA] 
increased her credibility rating and rose in terms of voter 
preference, according to a 12-15 March poll conducted for 
Telemetro Channel 13. 
  The survey conducted just more than 50 days before the 8 May 
elections indicates the PRD candidate's credibility rating fell 
from 38.9 to 34.6 percent, while Mireya Moscoso de Gruber's 
credibility rating rose from 6.4 to 9.1 percent. Approximately 
20 percent of the voters remain undecided regarding who has the 
highest credibility in terms of his or her proposals. 
  According to the poll, which was conducted among 3,194 
people 
aged 18 or older nationwide, the PRD candidate continues to 
occupy the top place in voter preference with 33 percent. 
Compared with the previous poll, Perez Balladares only gained 
0.2 percentage points. 
  Ruben Dario Carles came in second place with support from 
16.1 percent of the respondents. This implies a 0.1 percent 
reduction in his support when compared with the results of the 
first survey conducted 9-11 February. 
  The increase in the approval rating of Mireya Moscoso de 
Gruber, who has said she does not believe in polls, should be 
pointed out. Moscoso de Gruber went from 9.9 percent to 12.2 
percent in voters' preference, which translates into a gain of 
2.3 points. The drop of Panamanian singer Ruben Blades should 
also be highlighted; he went from 14.8 percent to 11.2, 
reflecting a decline of 3.6 points. 
  The other candidates obtained the following approval 
ratings: 
Eduardo Vallarino of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) got 
3.2 percent; Samuel Lewis Galindo of the National Consensus 
Alliance (Solidarity and the National Unity Movement) obtained 
2.6 percent; and Jose Salvador Munoz of the Doctrinaire 
Panamenist Party received 0.6 percent. It should be noted that 
Vallarino gained 1.2 percent from the previous poll, while Lewis 
Galindo fell 0.3 percent. 
  Regarding the candidates with the greatest credibility in 
terms of their proposals, the survey revealed the most 
significant changes occurred with candidates Perez Balladares 
and Mireya Moscoso de Gruber. Perez Balladares' credibility 
dropped from 38.9 percent to 34.6, while Moscoso de Gruber's 
rose from 6.4 percent fo 9.1 percent. 
  Regarding people's mayoral candidate preferences in the 
District of Panama, it was learned that approximately 47 of 
every 100 people will vote for Omaira "Mayin" Correa. Her 
closest contender is the PRD's Andres Vega "Domplin," whose 
approval rating remained at about 22 percent. 
  Of the rest of the candidates, former First Lady Ana Mae 
Diaz 
de Endara [title as published] came in in third place with a 7.1 
percent approval rating.

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 22 Mar (NA) -- President Carlos 
Menem reiterated yesterday that the Olivos Pact signed with Raul 
Alfonsin for the constitutional reform "will be fulfilled." He 
added: "Other aspects, not included in the pact, may be 
incorporated." 
  Menem said yesterday: "This electoral process is known 
throughout Argentina and the world, it is known that the 
Constitution will be reformed." He denied there is public 
indifference toward the move. 
  Menem asked: "In the past, people were either concerned or 
unconcerned saying: after all the government party will impose 
its will. Now there is consensus and the people are saying it 
has all been prearranged. What do the people really want?" 
  In an interview in the "Haddad and Longobardi" program [not 
further identified], Menem reiterated: "Absolutely nothing has 
been prearranged. A pact has been signed, and based on it the 
constituent members will work to carry out the reform." 
  Menem is optimistic about the result of the upcoming 10 
April 
elections. He says the Justicialist Party "will increase the 
percentage obtained on 3 October, although I may be wrong." 
  He added: "The Radical Civic Union will also do well." In 
the federal capital it "will fight with the Justicialist Party 
for first place." 
  Regarding the position of minister coordinator, Menem said 
the position will be in force "when the Constituent Assembly 
approves it. It is its decision." [passage omitted] 
  Regarding his talks with U.S. Vice President Al Gore, 
President Menem denied any pressure to approve the patents law. 
He said he asked Gore for a similar attitude regarding the U.S. 
policy on subsidies on agricultural products. 
  Menem hinted that Gore's message was: "Without a patents 
law, 
it will be a bit difficult for you to join NAFTA." 
  Regarding the case of the Argentine Airlines, Menem said the 
agreement has not yet been signed. He added: "There is an 
agreement in principle, therefore I don't want to comment on 
something that has not concluded."

  [Excerpt] General Cedras must resign as head of the 
military in order to facilitate a quick solution to the crisis, 
says Reynold Georges [leader of ALAH, Alliance for the 
Liberation and Progress of Haiti], who criticizess Raoul Cedras' 
attitude, which he calls that of a clan chief. In statements to 
Signal FM, Georges has expressed total support for the French 
ship carrying humanitarian aid to Haiti. The situation cannot 
remain entangled because of a single man, he asserts. Reynold 
Georges says Mr. Cedras must leave. 
  [Begin Georges recording, in Creole] We in ALAH agree with 
the aid. The reason we agree with the aid is that we cannot let 
the Haitian people die. We have heard that other political 
organizations (?oppose it.) As far we are concerned, we say no. 
The ship must arrive because we cannot let the people's children 
die. The situation is serious, there is no medicine, and if we 
let the people's children die, this means we are not responsible 
persons. There is no glory in death. 
  When one is a political leader, one must manage one's 
country 
for the benefit of its people. If you let the people die, you 
have failed. This is the reason we say that the aid must come: 
Those who staged the coup d'etat have not managed it for the 
benefit of the Haitian people. They have managed for the benefit 
of their friends and relatives, which we protest. This is the 
reason we are urging the Armed Forces once again -- in 
compliance with Article 265 of the Constitution -- to withdraw 
from politics: They have proved the international community 
right in saying there is a military junta in Haiti. 
  We in ALAH have eventually come to agree with the 
international community that it is indeed the Army that is 
leading the country. People must be courageous enough to say 
that. If one does not speak the truth, one will not be freed.

  [Excerpt] Mexico City, 22 Mar (EFE) -- Manuel Camacho 
Solis, government commissioner for peace and reconciliation in 
Chiapas, today said he will not seek the Mexican presidential 
candidacy, thus denying the rumors circulating in this regard in 
political circles. 
  At a news conference in a Mexico City hotel today, 
47-year-old Camacho Solis said he will not be a candidate in the 
21 August presidential elections. He also said he will not be a 
candidate for senator or deputy. "Yes, I would like to be 
president of Mexico, but not at any price," Camacho Solis 
stressed when he reiterated that he will not be a candidate in 
the next electoral period, although he did not rule out that he 
might run in the elections in the year 2000. 
  Camacho Solis said that "between seeking a presidential 
candidacy and the contribution I can make to the peace process, 
I choose peace. The decision might disappoint some, but I would 
reproach myself if I placed another decision above peace."

  [Text] Caracas, 23 Mar (DPA) -- The Venezuelan Foreign 
Ministry confirmed to DPA today that Venezuelan Foreign Minister 
Miguel Burelli Rivas is withdrawing his candidacy for secretary 
general of the OAS. Burelli Rivas will make his withdrawal 
official at Miraflores Palace (government headquarters) this 
afternoon, even though last week he insisted to foreign 
journalists that he would continue his candidacy until election 
day, this Sunday in Washington. 
  According to media reports, the Venezuelan foreign minister 
had only received the support of the Haitian Government in 
exile. With his withdrawal, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd 
Niehaus and Colombian President Cesar Gaviria remain in the 
competition for the hemispheric post.

  [Text] As for foreign relations, the Venezuelan Government 
today decided to withdraw Foreign Minister Miguel Angel 
Burelli's candidacy for OAS secretary general. 
  [Being Burelli recording] As unusual practices developed 
during the elections, the OAS's spirit of equality and democracy 
was exceeded. The OAS has always maintained the alternation or 
rotation principle, by which a country, regardless of how 
honorable its aspirations are, should not occupy the OAS post if 
that country has already occupied it in the past. Such an 
attitude would be detrimental to those nations that have never 
occupied it. 
  Of course, this attitude does not mean that the merits of 
the 
other candidates for this post should not be recognized. On 
those grounds, to continue serving the hemispheric cause with 
dignity, which is definitely important, the national government 
makes public the withdrawal of its candidacy for OAS secretary 
general, because there are no concrete objections to the 
autonomy of the elections. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Wilfredo Cordoba from the "KL Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate for the 
Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA], said a few minutes ago 
that he is ready to defeat the leftist coalition in a runoff 
election and added that he is unafraid of facing a 
centrist-leftist coalition. The politician also mentioned the 
irregularities that emerged in last Sunday's elections. 
  [Begin recording] [Calderon Sol] It has been proven that the 
Salvadoran people do not want the radical left. It has been a 
vote to reject them. I do believe they have won a political 
opening for democratic opposition and an opportunity to 
demonstrate their adherence to the system. We hope they can 
finally join the country's political life. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is there going to be a vote recount? 
Are you going to call for a vote recount to see if you can 
[words indistinct]? 
  [Calderon Sol] We are not interested in discussing the first 
round. If a runoff election is needed, we will support it 
because we want a clear, impressive, and marvelous mandate. We 
know we are going to have 70 percent support or more, perhaps 75 
percent. It is going to be a clear, definitive, five-year 
mandate. 
  [Reporter] What were the most serious problems surrounding 
the elections? 
  [Calderon Sol] I believe it was the situation at the voting 
centers, the lack of information for voters, and the logistics 
problems that existed that day. The real problem was the lack 
of information for voters. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [Calderon Sol] On the contrary, we have a month to tell the 
truth to the Salvadoran people. I believe the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal will be forced to do an evaluation and correct the 
mistakes that were made. That way we can have a massive turnout 
in the next elections, and I am sure that all the Salvadoran 
people will accompany us. [end recording] 
  That was a portion of the statements made by Dr. Armando 
Calderon Sol, presidential candidate for the ruling ARENA. 
Meanwhile, at the vote counting center, there is speculation 
about the number of deputies' seats that could have been won by 
the various political parties after certain percentages were 
made known. According to unofficial figures made available so 
far, ARENA would have obtained 40 deputies; the FMLN, 20 
deputies; the Christian Democratic Party, 16 deputies; 
Democratic Convergence, three deputies; the National 
Conciliation Party, three deputies; and the Unity Movement, one 
deputy. These are unofficial figures that could change once the 
total number of votes obtained from each of the departments is 
made available.

<F P=106> [Phone interview with President Ramiro de Leon Carpio by </F>
Jacobo Zabludovsky -- live] 
  [Text] [Zabludovsky] Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio is on the telephone. Mr. President, we hear you. 
  [De Leon] With great consternation, I wish to voice, on 
behalf of the people and Government of Guatemala, that the 
tragic death of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, presidential 
candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] of 
Mexico, has filled me with consternation, because of the loss of 
an outstanding and important statesman for the democratic 
development of a sister country and also because I had 
friendship ties with him that were strengthened when he visited 
us as senator and president of the Permanent Conference of Latin 
American Political Parties. 
  I wish to tell you that on that occasion, when I had the 
privilege of talking to him, we identified with our respective 
projects, he as political leader, and I as human rights 
ombudsman. Recently, he sent me a political envoy to advise me 
that in his program he would include the strengthening of 
relations between our countries, because he believed that 
geographical neighborhoods should be the object of broad and 
constructive cooperation. 
  I think that the Mexican people are astonished, from what I 
have seen on television, at a crime that is condemnable from 
every standpoint, but the Mexican people, I think, have solid 
and firm institutions that are capable of overcoming 
unreasonable acts of violence that have been occurring 
everywhere in the world. In this case, they have been happening 
in Mexico since 1 January to the detriment of the Mexican people. 
  The answer to provocations is within the framework of a 
legal 
regime, and, I think, it is based on the permanent inclination 
to ensure that justice is served, as has always been the case in 
the Mexican nation. 
  The political message of Colosio gains greater strength and 
I 
think that it has become more legitimate and pure, and stands as 
an example for all world democratic sectors. I sent my personal 
message to President Salinas de Gortari, with whom I met 
recently during a state visit, an official visit in Mexico. I 
expressed my solidarity with him in this time of mourning. 
  I told him that Guatemalans view him as a serene leader, and 
thus, we trust that despite the pain of this drama, he will, as 
well as the Mexicans, be able to overcome such as regrettable 
and condemnable incident, such as the one that transpired on the 
evening of 23 March. 
  I also addressed, via our diplomatic mission in Mexico, the 
esteemed family of the illustrious missing one to voice my 
sorrow and the sorrow of my family, government, and Guatemalan 
people. I urged them to be strong in view of this regrettable 
incident and to have faith in God to win comfort. I said that 
the notable social and political accomplishments should be the 
best homage to his memory. 
  As for the PRI and the other legal and democratic political 
forces of Mexico, I take advantage of this opportunity to voice 
our trust that as neighbors and brothers we will preserve peace 
with democracy and justice. We hope that the death of a just 
person will move us to reflection to pay homage to him by making 
his wishes come true. 
  I thank you for the opportunity you have given me to express 
the deep sorrow that overtakes me this evening, because of the 
loss of a Mexican patriot, and because, in one way or another, 
this event constitutes a shakeup and commotion among a people, 
who in contrast to ours, is not used to this kind of violent 
act. I regret this profoundly, from a human standpoint, because 
the most precious thing to a human being is his live, and in 
this case it was taken away from Colosio. 
  In my role as president of Guatemala, however, I lament this 
and express my sorrow to the Mexican people, who in the end are 
suffering consequences and it is unfair for them to suffer. We 
regret the events that have occurred since 1 January and events 
on the evening of 23 March, because we, the Guatemalan people, 
have suffered for so many years these kinds of violent acts, 
which lead nowhere. 
  As I said earlier, I expressed my sorrow to his family, to 
President Salinas de Gortari, but I especially extend my 
condolences to the Mexican people, whom I urge to be as strong 
and firm as possible to preserve democracy with justice, and 
above all, to ensure trust in its democratic institutions that 
for so many years have been an example for Latin America. 
  [Zabludovsky] Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
  [De Leon] Thank you very much. I reiterate my condolences to 
all the people of Mexico.

<F P=106> [Report by Eloisa Ibarra A.] </F>
  [Text] According to statements by private Attorney Daniel 
Olivas Zuniga [the private attorney representing the Genie 
family interests], General Humberto Ortega is barred from 
exercising his duties as head of the Armed forces as long as the 
precautionary measures ordered yesterday by Military Prosecutor 
Lester Gallo remains in effect. 
  Yesterday, after Ortega concluded his testimony on the Genie 
case, Gallo proceeded to order a house arrest for the general as 
per a request by the victims father, Mr. Raymond Genie Penalba. 
  Private Attorney Olivas explained that Gen. Ortega's 
military 
rank is not being withdrawn as a result of the precautionary 
measure, but his movements and duties as EPS [Sandinist People's 
Army] chief have been restricted. According to the attorney, 
"at this time he is not the chief." He added that should 
Ortega's endorsement as EPS chief be required, he would be 
disqualified from proceeding unless the documents had been dated 
prior to the date when the house arrest orders were issued. 
[sentence as received] 
  Ortega was questioned yesterday for more than five hours by 
Military Prosecutor Lester Gallo, the defense lawyer, and the 
private attorney in order to learn what he really knows about 
the 28 October 1990 crime against Jean Paul Genie. The general 
and his bodyguards are charged with being the alleged 
perpetrators, accomplices, and accessories to the death of Genie 
since they shot him to death on the night of 28 October 1990 
when he tried to pass them at the 8 km marker on the Masaya 
highway. 
  Before proceeding to testify, Ortega presented a writ 
whereby 
he voluntarily disqualifies himself from duties directly linked 
to his military obligations as long as the Genie enquiries 
lasts. Mr. Olivas explained that with the general's 
disqualification, he, as head of the Armed Forces, will no 
longer have to decide if the case, in which he is one of the 
accused, is to be annulled or not. In this case, it will be up 
to the other members of the EPS General Command to decide if an 
annulment request will or will not be presented to the Supreme 
Court of Justice. 
  During lengthy questioning, the EPS chief stated that on the 
day the incident occurred, after leaving the home of Colonel 
Lenin Cerna he went to the general command offices and later to 
his home where he remained all night. The general also stated 
that on that particular day his chief of security was Roberto 
Chacon and that they were not carrying any weapons. 
  When asked by the private attorney if he was responsible for 
giving the orders during the incident, Ortega answered: no, that 
was the chief of security's responsibility. Based on Ortega's 
statements, if an indictment is filed against his bodyguards, 
Roberto Chacon would be the person most likely to be charged 
with Genie's death given that he would be held responsible for 
having ordered the shooting. 
  Private Attorney Olivas questioned Ortega on the results of 
an investigation by the Venezuelan police, in response to which 
Ortega said that the report is technically inadequate and that 
they were not in Nicaragua long enough to arrive at serious 
conclusions. He also described the report as being 
"politicized." 
  On several occasions, the private attorney also questioned 
the general on the possible destruction of evidence and 
obstruction of police investigations. The military officer 
stated that the commission established to investigate the case 
in no way refused to cooperate with the police in their 
investigation. With respect to the destruction of the weapons 
withdrawal and surrender log, Ortega answered that it was normal 
procedure to destroy the documents once they were no longer 
needed. 
  After concluding his testimony, Ortega described the 
accusations as "a well orchestrated campaign by unimportant 
groups who have taken advantage of the Genie family's 
misfortunes to attack the EPS." 
  Ortega's statements were refuted by Raymond Genie who said 
that the charges are against the general and not the EPS, and 
that he has never lent himself to be used in any campaign by any 
group whatsoever. 
  Yesterday, Gen. Humberto Ortega presented a motion to 
Military Prosecutor Lester Gallo disqualifying himself from some 
of his military obligations "directly linked to military 
jurisdiction" as long as inquiries related to the Genie case 
continue.

<F P=106> [Report by Oliver Bodan] </F>
  [Text] Mariano Barahona and Orlando Corrales, counsels for 
the defense of the eight bodyguards allegedly involved in Jean 
Paul Genie's murder, said yesterday that Army General Humberto 
Ortega is still commander of the Sandinist Armed Forces [EPS]. 
  Barahona and Corrales flatly denied that the cautionary 
measure against Ortega meant a house arrest. 
  In addition, the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] 
National Directorate [DN] has expressed its moral support for 
the EPS Commander's "responsible stance" of appearing in court 
"with a constructive spirit." The FSLN DN backed all points in 
the letter Ortega addressed to the country. The FSLN DN agreed 
with Ortega on the existence of a smear campaign against the EPS 
unleashed by ultrarightists in Nicaragua and the United States. 
According to Article 103, Chapter IV of the Military Criminal 
Law, "the indicted person's pledge not to leave his home shall 
consist of the obligation not to leave the same, or any place 
where he might happen to be residing temporarily, without 
authorization from the prosecutor or the court, as the case may 
be, except to tend to his business, care for his health, or 
pursue higher education." 
  In an open letter, Barahona and Corrales insisted that Gen. 
Ortega only removed himself from learning about any procedure 
"directly or indirectly" connected with the trial. They also 
said that Ortega "has voluntarily resigned his jurisdictional 
powers." 
  According to the counsels for the defense, the cautionary 
ruling issued against Ortega was "unnecessary because the 
general has never refused to appear in court." 
  By contrast, Judge Advocate Lester Gallo Sandoval, who is in 
charge of the preliminary military investigations, has told 
BARRICADA that "the house arrest will continue for indefinitely 
but that he will continue to perform his normal functions." 
  Gallo said he will announce his "conclusions" in about six 
weeks. Inspector General Lieutenant Colonel Denis Moncada 
Colindres will then announce the final sentence, which can be 
appealed by the two parties through a writ of appeal presented 
to the Supreme Court of Justice. Regarding yesterday's doubts 
about whether Ortega had been temporarily suspended, the 
prosecutor said that "the president of the Republic," who is 
also the defense minister according to law, "is the person who 
decides whether he is suspended."

for the sensible attitude of Army Chief General Humberto Ortega, 
who went with a constructive spirit before a court of justice to 
give a deposition. 
  The DN agrees with all of the points in the letter made 
public yesterday by the army chief, who said there is an 
organized political manipulation over the sorrowful death of 
young Jean Paul Genie. 
  The DN expresses its solidarity with the Sandinist People's 
Army [EPS] in the face of an attempt to ruin the EPS' prestige 
and eliminate it through a campaign orchestrated by 
ultrarightist sectors from Nicaragua and the United States. 
  The EPS has been fundamentally an instrument of defense of 
sovereignty and self-determination, peace and reconciliation, 
and our people admit that. The Army has shown a high spirit of 
institutional discipline, and it is a solid guarantee for the 
stability of Nicaragua. 
  The government, the justice courts, civilian society, and 
the 
FSLN are obligated to consolidate that role. The FSLN hereby 
makes an appeal that tragic events such as the case of Jean Paul 
Genie not to be manipulated or politicized and that justice be 
expedited for the satisfaction of all Nicaraguans. 
Free fatherland or death. FSLN DN.

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Bernard Pallais has 
repeated the testimony he gave under oath at the 7th Criminal 
Court, which was in charge of the preliminary investigation of 
the murder of Jean Paul Genie, who was shot to death on 28 
October 1990. 
  Dr. Pallais, who was deputy government minister at the time 
and in charge of public security, was subpoenaed to testify on 
Tuesday afternoon before the military judge, First Lieutenant 
Lester Gallo Sandoval. Pallais confirmed that, upon 
instructions from the government, he and high-ranking Police 
officers took over the investigation in connection with this 
case. 
  [Begin recording] [Pallais] Yes, I was summoned by the 
president of the Republic to participate in a meeting two or 
three days after the death. During the meeting I was told about 
the importance of this case because the victim's father had 
information that led him to believe it was possible that the 
shots came from a military motorcade. Consequently, and given 
that rumors... 
  [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] Doctor, did you... 
  [Pallais, interrupting] Given the rumors circulating which 
implied that the motorcade was led by Army General Humberto 
Ortega, I was instructed to supervise the investigations that 
the National Police had begun and to maintain close contacts 
with Mr. Genie so he would trust that justice would prevail and 
would therefore be inclined to cooperate in the investigation by 
giving the names of witnesses whom he had identified and who 
said they were afraid to testify. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Eduardo Barberena S.] </F>
  [Text] While the Antidrug Bill stagnates at the National 
Assembly, drug trafficking and drug consumption continues to 
grow as the crisis that overwhelms us. According to the latest 
police reports for the 1981-89 and 1990-93 periods, the 
consumption of drugs has increased 112 percent. 
  Leonel Espinoza, National Police deputy director and 
regiment 
commander, presented the raw figures on drug trafficking and 
consumption of cocaine, crack, and marijuana to the National 
Assembly at a debate of the drug bill, which is being examined 
by magistrates, government ministry officials, and delegates 
from nongovernment organizations. 
  During the forum-debate, which was sponsored by the National 
Assembly, the Program to Support the Promotion of and Training 
for Human Rights in Central America [UCA-CEE], and the National 
Antidrug Committee, the deputy police chief gave a historical 
account of drug trafficking activities in the Atlantic up to 
1989, when cocaine was traded for liquor, home appliances, and 
shrimp near Corn Island. 
  When the current government assumed office on 25 April 1990, 
the control and surveillance systems in the national territory 
virtually disintegrated and South American drug cartels launched 
a plan to make Nicaragua the springboard for shipping drugs to 
the United States, Europe, and other countries of the world. 
People who had relations with drug dealers in the United States 
began arriving in Nicaragua in 1990. These people had the 
ability to set up traffic routes and make the country a drug 
warehouse. "We have no doubts that large quantities of drugs are 
passing through Nicaragua en route to the United States," 
Commander Espinoza said in a debate attended by only five of the 
Assembly's 92 members. Criminal Prosecutor Jose Antonio Fletes 
and National Assembly Drug Commission head Doris Tijerino have 
criticized the absenteeism. 
  According to official statistics, 535.936 kg of cocaine were 
seized, 20 marijuana plots were discovered, and 145 people were 
arrested in 1990. In 1991, 761.642 kg of cocaine and 13 bundles 
plus 33 kg of marijuana were confiscated, 5,570 marijuana plants 
were destroyed, and 58 people were arrested. In 1992, the police 
seized 155.449 kg of cocaine, nine kg of heroin -- the latter in 
an Ecuadoran-made picture frame bound for Ecuador from Istambul 
aboard a banana-carrying ship -- and 1,124 pounds (lb) of 
marijuana, and 31,068 marijuana plants were destroyed. In 
addition, 430 people were arrested. 
  In 1993, authorities seized 96.209 kg of cocaine, 517 lb of 
marijuana, and 159 crack lumps, destroyed 9,408 plants, and 
arrested 1,517 people. This indicates a larger number of people 
involved in drug trafficking. In 1994, 540 kg of cocaine were 
confiscated in the Ocean Operation; 108 kg were confiscated in 
Puerto Cabezas in a boat reportedly to have arrived with 900 kg. 
The community of Sandy Bay and Brooklyn Rivera surrendered 93 
kg. The police recovered another 20 kg. In all, 108 kg of drugs 
were confiscated and later destroyed in Puerto Cabezas. 
Commander Espinoza confirmed that in Managua raids, the police 
have found cocaine from a shipment arriving aboard launches 
through Sandy Bay in the Atlantic. 
  From January to March this year, the police have seized 574 
kg (450 in the Oceano Operation), 108 from Sandy Bay, and the 
rest from drug traffickers, Espinoza said. From 1990-93, 
1,549.23 kg of cocaine were seized by the police. Of these, 
1.227 tonnes came from the international drug market and 322 kg 
from the local market. Most of it from the Atlantic. The amounts 
seized have been increasing steadily. In comparison with 
international parameters, Nicaraguan authorities barely catch 
four percent of the total traffic. Comparing police statistics 
for the 1981-89 and 1990-93 periods, "we see that drug 
trafficking has increased 112 percent, a very alarming number," 
he said. 
  Referring to the drug bill which the Assembly is debating, 
he 
said it is essential. He pointed out, however, that some of the 
articles on confiscation "should specify that the drug seized 
should be accredited 50-50 percent to the Police and the Health 
and Education Ministries."

<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Celis Alban] </F>
  [Text] If Sunday's election results continue along their 
current trend, as per the last bulletin from the National 
Registrar, out of 163 seats, the Liberal Party won 89 seats in 
the Chamber of Representatives (91 percent of the voting tables 
have been counted), while the Conservative Party won 50. 
  The remaining seats, a mere 12 percent [number as 
published], 
are being distributed in quotas of little importance among the 
New Democratic Force, the National Salvation Movement, the 19 
April Movement Democratic Alliance [AD/M-19], People's Will 
[Voluntad Popular] (Barranquilla), the Christian, metapolitical, 
civic, and independent groups. 
  Among the election's large vote-grabbers in Valle is 
incumbent Representative Fernando Tello Dorrons, who soared with 
40,934 votes. The closest contender obtained 28,989 votes. 
  In Barranquilla, Ines Gomez de Vargas, from the People's 
Will, to which Mayor Bernardo Hoyos belongs, came in first over 
the others with 38,771 votes. Conservative Mario Varon Olarte, 
came in second, and Tarquino Pacheco who belongs to Hoyo's 
movement, came in third. 
  In Caldas, Liberal Rodrigo Garavito was reelected with a 
notable 38,155 votes. 
  In Antioquia, liberals garnered 179,314 votes and the 
conservatives 148,140. This means that the liberals maintained 
the 10 seats they already had while the conservatives increased 
from six to seven seats. 
  In Santa Fe de Bogota, a big surprise was the significant 
climb of Carlos Alonso Lucio, who had abandoned the AD/M-19 long 
before the elections. Because of this, not only was he was 
saved from the across the board "burnout" of this movements' 
candidates, but he also led with the largest number of votes: 
24,717. Lucio believes this support is the result of this 
opposition activity that characterized his political actions. 
  Another surprise was Maria Zulia Mena Garcia, one of the 
leaders of the totally unknown -- nationwide -- Organization of 
the People's Neighborhoods of the Pacific Coast [Organization de 
Barrios Populares de la Costa Pacifica, Obapo]. This is a 
candidate who has worked exclusively inside the black 
communities. She won 37,156 votes, although she had never 
participated in elections and her campaign was waged with 
minimum economic resources. It is well to note that this is the 
first time that the blacks in Colombia participated in elections 
through a special district for ethnic minorities. 
  The AD/M-19 electoral retreat had only two exceptions. 
Janeth Suarez was elected to the Chamber of Representatives in 
Barranquilla and Franklin Segundo Garcia was elected in Vichada. 
They are this group's only parliamentary representatives. 
  The Liberals were the strongest force in Cundinamarca where 
Martha Catalina Daniels, Jose Gregocio Alvarado, Fernando 
Ramirez, and Roberto Moya were elected. 
  Representatives to the Chamber elected with the lowest 
number 
of votes were in the newest departments, mainly Amazonas, 
Guaviare, Guainia, Vichada, and Vaupes. In Vichada there was a 
spectacular finish. Liberal Jaime Gonzalez garnered 1,692 votes 
to defeat the AD/M-19 candidate, who garnered 1,691.

  [Text] The Colombian Embassy in Washington and the Justice 
Ministry stated yesterday that they had no knowledge of the 
alleged decision by the U.S. State Department to suspend 
judicial cooperation and evidence exchange with Colombia until 
the scope of the Procedure Code is explained. 
  Gabriel Silva, Colombian ambassador in Washington, was 
puzzled by dispatches to that effect datelined in Washington by 
the news agencies AFP and AP, which attributed the information 
to the State Department. Silva indicated that no communication 
in that regard has taken place and added that, to the contrary, 
work is being conducted to agree on criteria on the matter of 
cooperation, "because whenever difficulties have arisen the aid 
has not been suspended." Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez said 
that "the government has no information to that effect neither 
in Bogota nor in Washington." 
  Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta and Prosecutor 
General Gustavo de Greiff made similar comments. After several 
consultations with officials in Colombia and the United States, 
they dismissed the reports. The attorney general said that 
important meetings are being held with U.S. officials to resolve 
the problems that may have arisen regarding the policy of 
surrendering to justice. 
  "There are differing views and interpretations regarding the 
policy of surrendering to justice and reducing sentences, but 
the U.S. Government has not formally made a decision," Silva 
said. According to Ambassador Silva, Colombian and U.S. 
officials have been discussing for some time judicial 
cooperation and how to resolve a series of obstacles that have 
arisen. "Cooperation is a two-way street," Silva noted, "and to 
cooperate we must be in agreement, and that is what where we 
stand." Justice Minister Gonzalez said the government has not 
received any kind of official communication on the alleged 
suspension of judicial exchange with the United States. 
"Although we have had differences, it has not led to a break in 
cooperation, and, quite the opposite, we hope to foster a 
climate to reinforce that cooperation because it is 
indispensable to combating drug trafficking for the sake of 
Colombia and mankind," Gonzalez added. 
  The differences between U.S. authorities and the Office of 
the Prosecutor General revolve around what the United States 
views as confusing guidelines within the Penal Procedure Code on 
the matter of sentence reductions. On this matter, the justice 
minister flatly denied that said code contains any benefit or 
automatic reduction of sentences to crminials who surrender or 
provide information to the Justice Ministry but rather gives the 
Office of the Prosecutor General discretionary power to grant 
some benefits provided the cooperation with justice is 
effective. "Surrendering alone does not entail a sentence 
reduction since effective cooperation with justice is 
indispensable," Gonzalez explained. This official, along with 
the Office of the Deputy Prosecutor General, promoted the code 
reform in Congress.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Colombian Attorney General Carlos </F>
Gustavo Arrieta by Dario Arizmendi -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Arizmendi] Will you fly to the United States (?in 
the next few hours) as was reported in a television newscast 
last night? 
  [Arrieta] [Words indistinct] there would not be any doubt. 
For the time being, however, I have no plans to travel. 
  [Arizmendi] What does the Attorney General's Office know 
about the reported plans of three U.S. senators to present in 
the Senate a proposal requesting the removal or resignation of 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff? 
  [Arrieta] I have no information. To tell you the truth, I do 
not think the U.S. Congress will embark on such a venture. 
  [Arizmendi] Excuse me, Mr. Attorney General, can you expand 
on that? 
  [Arrieta] I have no information on any Congress statement to 
that effect. I repeat: I do not think the U.S. Congress will 
embark on such a venture. Anyway, the Congress would be wrong 
to request the resignation of an independent official appointed 
by another administration and whose term in office is fixed. 
There has been some disagreement between the Colombian 
Government and U.S. authorities over [words indistinct]. 
Senator Kerry has made some remarks in the Senate, but I do not 
think the point has been or will be reached where the 
resignation of a Colombian official is requested. That's 
ridiculous. 
  [Arizmendi] Has the Colombian Justice Ministry, President 
Cesar Gaviria, or the Prosecutor General asked you to travel to 
the United States to discuss this subject so you can present 
your arguments regarding the independence of government branches 
in our country? 
  [Arrieta] I have been in permanent communication with the 
prosecutor general and President Gaviria on this subject. We 
have been making every effort and using every reasonable 
mechanism to solve this impasse. I have a feeling that we are 
beginning to make some headway. Should it be necessary to 
travel, I will do so gladly. I have discussed this possibility 
with De Greiff, the U.S. ambassador, and President Gaviria. The 
idea would be for me to act as a spokesman to explain certain 
aspects of the administration of justice inherent to the 
obedience to authorities and the division of government 
branches. We would try to clarify certain past 
misunderstandings about this subject. 
  [Arizmendi] Was any aspect of the subject clarified during 
your conversation with the U.S. ambassador in Santa Fe de Bogota? 
  [Arrieta] That is what we have been trying to do. We want to 
make a decision. Some progress has been made and some solutions 
found. I hope we will be able to make progress and establish 
some type of harmonious and cordial working relationship after 
some time. I cannot guarantee that it will happen, but that is 
what we are trying to do. 
  [Arizmendi] Has De Greiff been affected by this public 
controversy and the opposition in the United States to his 
position? 
  [Arrieta] [Words indistinct] the situation is regrettable. 
As 
the result of what I have been discussing with De Greiff, the 
most important aspect of all this process -- which I would like 
to leave behind, Dario -- is that we are beginning to reach 
points of agreement that will make it possible for us to 
progress. As I have said for some time, Dario, this is too 
complex a problem for Colombia. A confrontation that is 
simultaneously local, interinstitutional, and international with 
the United States would be (?undesirable). I think all involved 
parties agree on the need to keep making progress. My talks 
with the executive and the prosecutor general have made me 
optimistic that we will gradually iron out our differences and 
advance in this process. 
  [Arizmendi] Ten days have already elapsed since you said you 
would again carefully study the request to transfer five inmates 
from Modelo prison to the national prison in Itagui. Do you 
have a reply from the prosecutor general on this subject? Will 
he persist in his position? 
  [Arrieta] I have not heard about his official position on 
the 
subject. I do know that he has requested some additional 
information from the government, which gave him a thorough 
explanation of the government's reservations regarding this 
transfer. I suppose De Greiff is studying the explanation. So 
far, however, there has been no further insistence on this 
transfer. 
  [Arizmendi] We have read in the Atlantic coast newspapers 
and 
seen in television newscasts pictures of Barranquila Mayor 
Bernardo Hoyos, a former priest, participating in public 
demonstrations with Antonio Navarro Wolff and other 19 April 
Movement Democratic Alliance [AD/M-19] leaders. Mayor Hoyos 
even made speeches supporting the AD/M-19 candidate's 
aspirations. Will the Attorney General's Office investigate 
this open participation in politics? 
  [Arrieta] The situation is complex. Of course, we will open 
an inquiry. Participation in politics by a government official 
is punishable by Colombian law. As for the results of this 
inquiry, we will see. We will have to study the incidents you 
mentioned. Anyway, it is the Attorney General's Office's duty to 
open an inquiry. I am sure such an inquiry has already been 
undertaken by the departmental prosecutor's office for the 
Atlantic coast, because that is the office with the authority to 
investigate Mayor Hoyos.

  [Text] The surrenders and their negotiations have prompted 
a controversy over the attorney general's actions. These 
surrenders have made the North Americans furious, and the 
problem is going from bad to worse. 
  A top-level meeting to discuss the problem was held at the 
Presidential Palace this morning. At the end of the meeting, 
one of the participants, the government minister, played down 
the importance of the controversy. 
  [Begin recording] [Government Minister Fabio Villegas] It 
was 
a working meeting, just like the others we have been holding in 
recent weeks, to coordinate among the Executive Branch, the 
Prosecutor's Office, and the Attorney General's Office the 
implementation of the surrender policy to benefit justice in the 
country and to use it as a tool to end impunity. 
  [Reporter] I imagine that the prosecutor general versus the 
U.S. Congress topic was discussed at the meeting. 
  [Villegas] We discussed, among other topics, the 
international effects of disagreements over the surrender 
policy. I hope that the drug-consuming nations in general and 
the international community will continue and even step up the 
efforts made so far to support Colombia's struggle against drug 
trafficking. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "National" newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Anchorwoman Yolanda Ruiz] Another key man in the 
cartel of northern Valle del Cauca has just surrendered. He is 
Joyner Ospina Montoya, charged with drug trafficking and money 
laundering. In the negotiations prior to his surrender, his 
lawyers reportedly reached an agreement on a sentence that could 
mean he would only serve two years in jail. The "National" 
newscast was the only medium to witness the surrender. 
  [Reporter Sandra Vergara] Joyner Ospina Montoya appeared 
before the Regional Office of the Prosecutor General in Cali at 
1030 this morning. Ospina, his wife, and Cesar Guzman, his 
lawyer, rode in these vehicles from the Plaza de Toros 
neighborhood, south of Cali, to the Regional Office of the 
Prosecutor General. 
  [Begin Guzman recording] This voluntary act is a show of 
confidence and faith in Colombian justice and the policy of 
surrendering. It is a sign of efficient cooperation with 
justice. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Why did he surrender? To what crimes 
will he confess? 
  [Guzman] Mr. Ospina today will confess to violating Law 30, 
the crime of drug trafficking, and money laundering. He will 
not confess to any other crime. [end recording] 
  [Vergara] These crimes could land him in jail for 30 years, 
but thanks to the benefits offered by the law, his sentence 
would be reduced to four years, not counting study and work 
while in prison, which would cut his sentence another two years. 
As the "National" newscast learned, he will disclose the names 
of other members of the organization and reveal the routes used 
for drug trafficking and money laundering. Joyner Ospina 
Montoya will be interrogated in a few hours, and later he will 
be taken to Palmira Prison. He will be held in the same wing 
where drug trafficker Julio Fabio Urdinola is jailed. 
  [Ruiz] According to the authorities, Joyner Ospina Montoya 
was also the man in charge of transporting the organization's 
drugs. Let us see who he is. 
  [Vergara] Joyner Ospina Montoya, 28 years old, married, and 
father of two children was born in Dovia north of Valle. He is 
another member of the northern drug-trafficking ring once headed 
by Juan Urdinola Grajales. He got involved in drug trafficking 
in 1988 in the United States. In 1990 he came to Colombia and 
became the right-hand man of Julio Fabio Urdinola, another 
member of this organization who surrendered to justice 15 days 
ago. 
  Ospina Montoya was in charge of shipping and distributing 
cocaine to the United States. He was also in charge of 
laundering money from the United States to Colombia. To date, 
we have no information of any legal process Colombian justice 
may have against him. We have learned, however, that he is 
facing charges for drug trafficking in U.S. courts. U.S. 
authorities tapped the telephones Ospina Montoya used to make 
all his contacts. In addition, informers confirmed his 
participation in drug trafficking and money laundering.

  [Text] Future concurrent Russian Ambassador to Paraguay Yan 
Burlyay stated on 22 March that Russia is interested in 
purchasing Paraguayan cotton. Burlyay arrived in our country 
during the afternoon of 22 March, and will present his 
credentials at a ceremony to be held 24 March at Government 
House. The ambassador will also officially submit to the 
government a list of products that Russia wishes to offer 
Paraguay. 
  Regarding cotton, he indicated that the textile could 
produce 
interesting results in his country, especially for Russia's 
foreign trade enterprises that work with large quantities. 
  Burlyay also indicated that Russia wants to cooperate with 
our country in the implementation of a trolley bus 
transportation system, and in the oil area. 
  He also highlighted the fact that he had brought a list of 
Russian products with him that could be offered on the 
Paraguayan market, such as metallurgical equipment, machinery, 
tools, presses, electric motors, industrial electrical 
equipment, generators, freight elevators, highway construction 
equipment (road levelers, bulldozers up to 50 hp), tractors, 
agricultural machinery, automobiles, airplanes, airport 
equipment, sport airplanes, watches and clocks, photographic 
equipment, ammonia sulphate, and potassium chloride, among 
others. 
  Regarding the operation for the exchange of goods, he stated 
that Russia is offering fertilizer in exchange for our country's 
agricultural and livestock products. 
  Upon presenting his credentials to the government, Burlyay 
will be the first concurrent ambassador to Paraguay with his 
seat in Buenos Aires (Argentina). Our fellow countryman Igor 
Fleisher has been honorary Russian consul since 1993. 
  "I am sure that thanks to the formalization of our 
relations, 
cooperation between the two countries will be given an 
additional push to the benefit of the peoples of the two 
countries," the diplomat said. 
  He indicated that his naming as concurrent ambassador to 
Paraguay will be the first step toward installing a resident 
ambassador in our country, as is the case with Germany, France, 
or Great Britain, just to cite a few European countries. 
  The new ambassadors from Thailand, India, and Iran, who 
arrived in our country on 22 March, will also present their 
credentials together with the concurrent Russian ambassador.

  [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy yesterday announced 
that he is willing to sign the Chapultepec (Mexico) declaration 
on freedom of the press that was signed by representatives of 
the continent's free press. The president visited this 
newspaper and affirmed that no means of communication will be 
closed nor censure imposed during his government. 
  Wasmosy visited ABC COLOR at 0745. At that time, company 
employees were commemorating the 10th anniversary of the closing 
of the newspaper and the 5th anniversary of the day it was 
reopened. 
  The president brought his greetings to our newspaper and 
said: "In the consolidation of democracy, I think that freedom 
and democracy are closely linked. Therefore, without your 
needing to ask me about it, I can assure you that I have broad 
shoulders and consider criticism positive, even though I 
sometimes think it unfair. The best way to consolidate 
democracy is to respect total freedom of the press." 
  Referring to press freedoms in our country, the president 
said: "Time and the readers will have the final word in choosing 
which is the most credible source. This is like passing through 
a fine sieve, because the truth moves slowly, but it prevails in 
the end. I thank you for your constructive criticism. That is 
the best way to cooperate with the government." 
  The president said: "In a democracy, responsibility does not 
lie on a single person's shoulders; in a democracy everyone is 
responsible. We must agree on the kind of Paraguay we want, and 
work for it. We must avoid doing things that are not very clear 
and which perhaps seek transitory victories, or revenge, or 
somehow distort what we really want for our country." 
  "Newspapers must help the public form an opinion. We must be 
conscious that our rights end where other people's rights begin. 
I think there is no better way to solve our problems than 
through dialogue and consensus," the president said. 
  In metaphorical language the president then added: "I will 
take advantage of this opportunity to say that democracy is like 
the decreasing water level of a lake. At first you do not see 
what is below. For instance, we cannot see what is lying on the 
bottom of Ypacarai Lake. We might find stones or mud. As soon 
as the water level starts dropping the problems that were always 
there and accumulated through time start coming to light. 
Today, thanks to the fact that people can talk, we can launch 
full investigations into all those problems." 
  In an forceful voice, the president then said: "Therefore, 
and without needing to ask me about it, you may rest assured 
that the press will not be censured, and no newspaper will be 
closed during my administration. You are witnesses that today 
no radio or television station is harassed, and I believe no 
journalist is being persecuted." 
  "When someone asked me for help and protection for a 
journalist in Pedro Juan Caballero I ordered that protection. 
We gave him all the guarantees. So you can rest assured. I 
have come here to give you this message so that you may rest 
assured. During my government no freedom will be curtailed," 
the president concluded. It was a short but very important 
speech. 
  Asked about his attitude with respect to the Chapultepec 
declaration, which was signed by some heads of government such 
as Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Guatemalan 
President Carlos de Leon Carpio, Wasmosy said that he would sign 
it with pleasure, because he considers freedom of the press to 
be essential for democracy. Without it you cannot govern, 
Wasmosy said.

  [Text] The Hague, 24 March (AFP) -- Suriname rebels 
threatening to blow up a hydroelectric dam freed all their 
hostages unharmed overnight, the Dutch news agency ANP reported. 
  The announcement came after the rebels freed four of their 
30 
hostages Wednesday. About 100 gunmen from a previously unknown 
Suriname Liberation Front stormed the dam site at Afaboka on 
Monday, demanding that President Ronald Venetiaan and his 
government resign and hand over to the national assembly.

<F P=106> [Report by Ligia Moreno ] </F>
  [Text] During a meeting with members of the Venezuelan 
Institute of Financial Executives, Finance Minister Julio Sosa 
Rodriguez said that he must meet with President Rafael Caldera 
to discuss Democratic Action's proposal to grant special powers 
to the president. Caracas Stock Exchange President Noris 
Aguirre and Finance Vice Minister (Luis Javier Grisanti) also 
participated in the meeting. 
  Minister Sosa indicated that in his opinion, a special 
powers 
bill would only serve to expedite measures he has already 
proposed. He emphasized that Venezuela has gone from an exchange 
rate of 4.30 bolivares per U.S. dollar to 115 bolivares per U.S. 
dollar without knowing for certain the reasons behind such a 
currency devaluation, which is most probably related to the 
fiscal deficit. He also pointed out that the government is very 
concerned about this situation and believes that there cannot be 
any in-depth changes to the Sosa Plan. Nevertheless, the 
possibility of a special powers law has not been rejected. 
  [Begin Sosa recording] I do not think modifications can be 
made and then a special powers law promulgated, because what 
they would really be doing is evaluating the same laws that 
allow them to promulgate such a law. If it is a special powers 
law, they are really passing the responsibility to the Executive 
Branch. [end recording] 
  Minister Sosa Rodriguez also emphasized that his visit to 
the 
United States had been positive because he felt that investors 
were receptive to Venezuela's proposals. He also stated that he 
did not understand a report in THE ECONOMIST [previous two words 
in English] that states the VAT should have been applied only at 
the retail level since implementing such a proposal is very 
difficult. In addition, in reference to gasoline, what the 
government can earn in revenue is merely 20 to 50 billion 
bolivares, which is insufficient to solve the country's problems. 
  Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez concluded by insisting 
that right now the most important thing is to pull Venezuela out 
of the economic and fiscal crisis it is currently facing.

  [Text] Central Information Office Minister [title as 
heard] Guillermo Alvarez Bajares said the Democratic Action [AD] 
proposal for a special powers law is interesting. He added, 
however, that it remains to be seen what methods will be used to 
reach a consensus in the legislature to approve the proposal. 
  Alvarez Bajares believes the measure would expedite the 
implementation of certain laws that must be applied quickly if 
they are to accomplish the intended objectives. 
  [Begin Alvarez Bajares recording] The AD proposal refers to 
the truly difficult situation the country is experiencing. We 
want to interpret this proposal with the utmost good faith in 
the sense that it can contribute to the expediency of 
decisionmaking and therefore speed up the process to solve the 
country's crisis. [end recording] 
  Alvarez Bajares noted that although the AD proposal is 
interesting, the government had at no time considered making 
such a proposal itself.

  [Text] Many members of the Executive Branch have said that 
the possibility of the Congress granting the president special 
powers by way of a law is interesting. Interior Minister Ramon 
Escovar Salom said the government should wait for the proposal 
to mature and be presented before making any official 
announcement. He said, however, that the government will not 
shy away from any responsibility handed down by the Legislative 
Branch. He stressed that the country's problems are not 
exclusively economic or financial. 
  [Begin recording] [Escovar] We would first have to see what 
exactly the scope of these powers will be. It would make more 
sense for these powers to allow the Executive Branch to deal 
with all aspects of the crisis, and to attack them with the 
swiftness and timeliness the nation demands. [end recording] 
  Ramon Escovar Salom pointed out that the proposal came from 
the Congress and not from Executive Branch. Nevertheless, he 
said the government cannot refuse to study the idea.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish carries on 
page A2 of its 11 March issue a 300-word unattributed report 
covering reactions to the economic aid the U.S. Government will 
reportedly grant to Peru in fiscal year 1995. 
  The report quotes New Majority-Change 90 lawmaker Ricardo 
Marcenaro Frers as saying: "Peru will receive the largest 
amount in Latin America, and this shows that the United States 
recognizes the Peruvian Government's efforts to move forward and 
reverse, in only three years, the crisis we were experiencing." 
  The report then quotes PPC, Popular Christian Party, 
lawmaker 
Mario Ocharan as saying that the U.S. decision was made because 
Peru "is putting its economy in order." 
  Finally, PPC lawmaker Alexander Kouri says the U.S. decision 
is very positive for Peru because the country received the 
largest amount in all of Latin America. 
  In its 12 March issue, the same newspaper carries on page A6 
a 500-word editorial entitled "Support for the Peruvian 
Government and People" on the same subject. 
  After reporting the aid announced for Peru by the U.S. 
assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, 
Alexander Watson, the editorial says: "If we go by Watson's 
statement, this is not only an economic benefit that will 
certainly be decisive in the antinarcotics effort and the fight 
against poverty, but also a clear expression of political 
support for the Peruvian people and government. The visit to 
Peru by the commission headed by Alexander Watson himself has 
served to make the real Peruvian situation known to the higher 
U.S. decisionmaking levels." 
  After elaborating on the results of the U.S. mission's 
visit, 
the editorial concludes: "Therefore, we welcome the scheduled 
aid, but above all, we welcome the example of democracy and 
effort by the Peruvian people, the majority of whom support 
their government."

<F P=106> [Interview with Chilean President Eduardo Frei by </F>
correspondent William Waack in Santiago; date not given] 
  [Text] [Waack] Chileans agree on three points: continuation 
of the economic model, political democracy, and the search for 
social justice. Is your only task now to fulfill those points? 
  [Frei] My first task is to continue this process. For the 
first time since 1915 there is continuity in the government in 
Chile. This is a sign of stability and support for the previous 
administration. By supporting my presidential candidacy for the 
coalition (the coalition of government parties made up mainly of 
Christian Democrats and Socialists) Chileans were judging an 
administration. The people judge a successful administration by 
electing a new government from the same group. This is very 
important for Chile, and defines my task. That is why I have 
been saying that my proposal is continuity and change at the 
same time. Continuity because we will maintain the economic 
policy, with the necessary corrections to fight poverty, 
concentrating on political stability. 
  [Waack] What will the changes be? 
  [Frei] This government has a different task. The Aylwin 
administration replaced an authoritarian regime that had lasted 
17 years. My program wants to solve the concrete problems of 
people. That is my emphasis. 
  [Waack] You have been talking about modernizing the Chilean 
Government, and you just asked your close aides to declare their 
assets, which will be compared with the assets when they leave 
the government. Are you concerned with corruption and the 
ineffectiveness of the state system? 
  [Frei] One of the main problems we have in Latin America is 
the gigantic state apparatus. In a modern democracy we want to 
further delegate decisions to the people. They should resolve 
their problems by themselves, while the state is opening more 
room and creating more opportunities. This is how the issues of 
honesty and administrative ability are handled. Fortunately in 
Chile, as a nation, we did not have generalized corruption in 
the public administration. But there are some signs of that 
evil. We are part of the world, and this is a world problem. 
From the first day, however, I would like to make clear signs 
of administrative honesty. Politics become discredited 
especially when the sense of ethics is lost. There are other 
basic values to be defended: the family's sense of public 
service, and the sense of our national identity. We don't want 
to build a society based only on consumerism. 
  [Waack] Do you believe Chile is becoming the first South 
American country to no longer be considered underdeveloped? 
  [Frei] That would be a great aspiration. We are making a 
great effort, but there is still a long way to go. World 
experience shows that the countries capable of defeating 
underdevelopment did so by maintaining long-term economic and 
social policies for more than 20 years. And this is what we are 
doing here in Chile. 
  [Waack] Is Chile defeating the vicious circle of poverty and 
misery? 
  [Frei] We are on the way, but we have not yet succeeded. 
When Aylwin was inaugurated, about 40 percent of the population 
lived in poverty and misery. Now the figure is about 27 
percent. Continuing the policy we are carrying out, I believe 
we will eliminate extreme misery within six years. 
  [Waack] Are you saying that Chile will be the first Latin 
American country to fully pay its social debt? 
  [Frei] We are working on it. My government's priority is to 
eliminate poverty. This purpose will be clearly noticeable in 
the decisions I will make during the first months of my 
administration. The country will feel the difference. But it is 
not only a government task, it is the entire country's 
responsibility. We will invite entrepreneurs, workers, and 
public servants to participate. It is a national goal much more 
than a government objective. 
  [Waack] Chile wants to join NAFTA. Are you concerned about 
Brazil's economic instability and the fact that Brazil is Latin 
America's largest country? 
  [Frei] Chile is prepared to negotiate a free trade agreement 
with the United States and to participate in NAFTA because the 
country has made a very great effort to correct all its 
macroeconomic indicators. We should understand that if we fail 
to achieve Latin American integration soon, we will not be able 
to compete with larger world conglomerates such as the Pacific 
group, the European Union, or NAFTA. We, Latin Americans, must 
unite in order to be able to compete with these conglomerates. 
We must align our economies, and in this respect I think 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic policies are very 
positive. We must converge our monetary, fiscal, customs, and 
ecological policies. That will permit us to advance in the 
integration process. 
  [Waack] Are you thinking of some kind of understanding or 
concrete steps to promote this type of integration with Brazil? 
  [Frei] I have been following Brazilian political situation, 
particularly Cardoso's career. I know him personally. Fernando 
Henrique lived in Chile for four years. He made many friends. 
He is a very respected political figure. This is why I care 
about his economic stabilization plan so much, and I wish him 
all the luck possible. 
  [Waack] Did you know that Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
is considered a virtual candidate for the presidency? 
  [Frei] I am perfectly aware of that. It would be very good 
if he becomes president. Fernando Henrique is a man of great 
vision. We could easily understand one other on a number of 
matters. An understanding with him would be very easy. 
  [Waack] Many people say that the person who is truly 
responsible for Chile's present stability is General Augusto 
Pinochet. Do you agree with that? 
  [Frei] I think we must depersonalize those aspects. The 
whole of society participated in the effort. It was an effort 
made by political parties and workers who understood what was 
important and relevant at certain moments. It was also an 
effort on the part of entrepreneurs, who trusted in the country 
and invested there. Last year we had the highest rate of 
savings and investment. The Armed Forces also participated in 
this effort. They understood that once a democratic government 
was elected they had to return to their barracks and to their 
constitutional role. All actors, therefore, contributed to the 
stability we enjoy today. 
  [Waack] Gen. Pinochet will continue to be a very important 
figure in Chile, just as he has been during the past 21 years. 
Will you be able to ignore him? 
  [Frei] I think... [pauses] I mean, it is not a matter of 
ignoring anyone. It is a matter of respecting the reality in 
which we are living. Our political situation is characterized 
by respect for the institutional system and the legal path we 
chose in 1989 to discuss democratic questions. We are changing 
the system from within. One of our tasks is to recover the 
president's prerogative to name the Armed Forces commander, who 
according to the Constitution currently in effect will stay in 
his post until 1977. The president must have the responsibility 
to appoint Armed Forces commanders, which has always been the 
case in Chile in the past -- just as it is established in all 
democratic countries in the world. This does not depend on 
individuals, preferences, or personal opinion. It is a matter 
of principle. 
  [Waack] Is your first political goal aimed at amending the 
Constitution to allow you to appoint the military commanders, 
and change the system for the election of members of the 
Constitutional Court and the organization of the National 
Security Council? 
  [Frei] I do not think we have different goals. The main, and 
most important, objective is that right from the beginning we 
are going to focus our attention on the peoples' real problems, 
that is, the crisis affecting the education and health systems. 
We are going to tackle the poverty problem that still affects a 
large percentage of our population. The people must feel that 
we, politicians, are concerned about their daily problems. 
Simultaneously there is a pending constitutional issue to be 
solved in Chile. It refers to the mechanism used to appoint the 
members of the Constitutional Court and the National Security 
Council (the current method favors the opposition). I do not 
think the current method to appoint the Constitutional Court 
members is democratic. I am not against a court of this type, 
which exists in every country. The problem is the method used 
to elect the Constitutional Court. The same goes for the 
National Security Council that was elected under the previous 
administration. 
  [Waack] What about the military? 
  [Frei] Those amendments to the Constitution will have to be 
made within the framework of a nationwide agreement, and not 
only through an agreement between the political parties and the 
government. We are going to negotiate in a responsible manner 
with the opposition, without taking into account the year 1997, 
which is when the mandate of the designated senators expires. 
We want to make these changes, and are seeking a political 
balance to do so. 
  [Waack] Aren't you worried about the fact that your 
predecessor was unable to solve the military issue? 
  [Frei] We can't say that President Patricio Aylwin did not 
solve that problem. This is, undoubtedly, a pending issue, but 
compared to the situation in 1989 the current situation is quite 
different. The Armed Forces respect the civilian power. The 
day after I was elected president, several authorities came to 
congratulate me. Among the representatives of the most varied 
sectors there were also the military commanders. They thus 
respect the elected and legally established civilian government, 
which, in turn, respects the professional role of the Armed 
Forces. 
  [Waack] Do you feel comfortable with the idea of having to 
coexist with a former dictator who still feels himself the judge 
of national issues? 
  [Frei] When you are elected president of the Republic you 
must focus your attention on the real problems that exist. 
Those real problems are what are important, not one's personal 
choices. There is a Chilean reality that must be respected. 
That is what is real. But in my opinion, the president of the 
Republic must recover his power, as in any part of the world, to 
appoint the military commanders. This problem does not depend 
on this or the other person. It is a matter of principles, and I 
stick to that principle. 
  [Waack] Do you think that there are still pockets within 
the security forces that are out of your control, such as in the 
case of the Brazilian psychologist who was arrested and tortured 
in a Santiago police station? 
  [Frei] I do not want to specifically refer to that case, 
because I did not follow nor am I aware of the legal procedures 
followed, but it is quite clear that it was a security problem, 
because she was involved with a terrorist group. A state of law 
prevails in Chile now. Therefore, if a person is arrested only 
the courts can decide whether or not that person is guilty of a 
crime. Neither the government nor the policy, only the courts. 
  [Waack] Your father governed Chile 30 years ago. Have you 
ever felt you were his political heir? 
  [Frei] No, definitely not. I feel very comfortable saying 
that. I have never in my life planned to become my father's 
political heir. His political heritage must be understood in 
the broadest sense of the word. He founded the Christian 
Democratic Party in Chile and, in that sense, gave us a 
reference framework of values and ideas which we have always 
followed. This is the path I am treading now, but I definitely 
do not feel myself to be his political heir. There are many 
Chileans who worked with him, belonged to his government, and 
can legitimately feel themselves to be his political heirs. I 
obviously carry his name with great pride. 
  [Waack] Chileans seem to be fond of traditional names, of 
political dynasties. Doesn't this seem a paradox in a society 
that many consider politicized? 
  [Frei] Well, there are many sons of presidents who never 
engaged in politics nor became president. There are also sons 
of well-known intellectuals or scientists who took other paths. 
I undoubtedly benefit from the great popularity my father's 
government enjoyed, but the people judge me for what I am doing 
today and not for what my father did 40 years ago. Chileans are 
interested in the future, and not the past. 
  [Waack] You started your career as a politician rather late 
in life. Was it a personal decision, or did circumstances get 
you involved in politics? 
  [Frei] As a famous Spanish poet said, men are always subject 
to circumstances. My decision was a personal decision. I 
accompanied my father during many years in campaigns, when I was 
young, but my decision to drop my work and engage in politics 
was entirely personal, and was made after my father had died. 
  [Waack] Your election is interpreted as the end of an 
important generation of politicians, of those who personally 
experienced the 1973 military coup. Do you feel you are closing 
an era in Chile? 
  [Frei] I don't think so. But there is an importance change 
in generation. Many of the ministers and secretaries who are 
going to accompany me are but 40 years of age or less. They 
were at school or in the university in 1973. 
  [Waack] Will discussions regarding human rights, which have 
steered politics over the past two decades, also end in Chile? 
  [Frei] Discussions regarding human rights will never end. 
Respect for human rights is a basic value of modern societies, 
and this is why it is a subject that can never be dropped. All 
cases of human rights violations have been brought before the 
courts, which is experiencing a crisis and must be reorganized, 
as the opposition itself admits. But the cases that are still 
being heard in court are still pending, that is a fact.

  [Text] Acting Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza has 
disclosed that Mexican authorities have gradually begun lifting 
the embargo on a shipment of Chilean fruit in the port of 
Manzanillo. 
  Although there is still no official information from the 
Mexican Government, Insulza told Radio Cooperativa that 
yesterday shortly after noon he received reports from Mexico 
City announcing the partial lifting of the embargo on the 
shipment. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] What news is there 
about the embargo on the Chilean fruit shipment? 
  [Insunza] Look, the situation is still rather confusing. 
According to the information we have, the embargo on the cargo 
from the first ship that was unloaded has been lifted, with the 
exception of a few boxes where a dead larva was found, which 
seems to have caused some problems and prompted the measure. I 
reiterate that there is no reason for this measure because 
Mexico has this type of larva, and therefore it poses no threat. 
The second ship is allegedly being subjected to a new 
inspection. [end recording] 
  Insulza explained that the Mexican embargo was ordered on 18 
March, and apparently there was some misunderstanding because 
Chilean authorities were not informed appropriately about the 
measures. 
  The acting foreign minister explained that on 3 March, the 
Mexicans decided to ban the entry of Chilean fruit that could be 
infested with the fruit fly. The decision was made after the 
Chilean Government, in compliance with the agreements in force, 
informed the Mexican Government about the existence of the fruit 
fly in Santiago. Mexico immediately stepped up restrictions, 
thus establishing new obstacles for the entry of Chilean fruit. 
  On 7 March, Mexico decided to circumscribe restrictions for 
the entry of Chilean fruit, and increased to 8 km the radius 
around the site where the presence of the fruit fly was 
detected. In view of this, Jose Miguel Insulza reiterated that 
the situation is regarded as serious by the Chilean Government, 
and admitted that despite the good will of Mexican authorities 
the measure causes material and intangible damages to Chilean 
producers.

<F P=106> [Article by Arturo Gomez Salgado] </F>
  [Text] Fernando Perez, president of the Mexican Association 
of Purchasing and Materials Management Executives, has estimated 
that 47 percent of the nation's firms are still facing serious 
productivity problems, adding that it will be very difficult for 
them to reach improved production levels within the next two 
years. Perez warned that NAFTA will trigger the closing of more 
small and micro-businesses. 
  Perez asserted that those who want to remain in the market 
will have to accept a substantial reduction in profit margins, 
which averaged about 30 percent until about a year ago. Perez 
stressed that new market strategies and aggressive competition 
will force most businesses to operate with single-digit profit 
margins at best. He added that the challenge lies in being more 
productive and competitive, which requires radical 
transformations that many companies will not be able to make. 
  Perez asserted that the time to reduce prices based on 
reductions in personnel has ended, and he noted, "it is crucial 
to promote programs that are imminently productive and that 
involve eliminating losses and the squandering of manhours." 
  He argued that because of problems rooted in years of 
operating within a closed economy, many industrialists will not 
be able to meet the challenges posed by NAFTA. He added that 
their final fate could be their virtual elimination in the face 
of increasingly aggressive competition and progressive 
diversification of quality products and decreasing prices. 
  Perez reiterated that those companies that want to survive 
will, above all else, have to merge with similar suppliers of 
capital and vanguard technology and accept, from now on, 
single-digit profit margins. 
  Perez believes the national economy is tending toward 
stabilization, although he admitted it is experiencing some 
volatility. He added that the economic slowdown, the lack of 
liquidity, and recent political instability helped trigger a 
30-percent drop in business purchases. Perez admitted that 
political instability persists, and he added that this is why it 
will not be until after the 21 August elections, and once all of 
the macroeconomic variables are accurately defined, that 
investment in all sectors will be truly reactivated. 
  Carlos Campos de la Vega, a consultant for Mexico's 
Nickerson 
Company, says large corporate inventories that have reached 30 
percent in many cases present a large problem. Campos expressed 
his support for greater diversification of products to promote 
competition. In addition, he indicated that if radical changes 
are not made within production lines, small and 
micro-businesses, which unfortunately show the greatest 
opposition to the commercial opening, will continue to vanish. 
  Both Perez and Campos spoke within the context of the topic: 
"The Effects of NAFTA on Mexican Businesses." Both agreed that 
such opening will generate benefits, which will result in 
greater productivity and competition, but that it will also 
involve costs, such as growing unemployment generated by the 
economic slowdown and the closing of hundreds of small and 
micro-businesses which cannot face the challenges of greater 
productivity and competition.

  [Text] Colonel Faustino Rico Toro was arrested by the 
Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] in Cochabamba last night. 
Rico Toro was one of former dictator Luis Garcia Meza's close 
assistants. But he was not tried with the former dictator. 
  He was appointed FELCN commander during Jaime Paz Zamora's 
government, although he had to resign a few hours later after 
observations made by the U.S. Embassy, which had suspicions of 
Rico Toro's links to drug traffickers. 
  His arrest occurred between 2100 and 2300 last night. He is 
being detained at a FELCN jail in Cochabamba. There is evidence 
against him. He is being questioned, FELCN Deputy Commander 
General Rogelio Vargas said. 
  Vargas added that he did not know whether Rico Toro will be 
transferred to La Paz. This is something that must be decided by 
prosecutors, he said. In another 48 hours we will know if the 
Cochabamba prosecutor's office will bring charges of drug 
trafficking against Faustino Rico Toro. If so, he will spend a 
few years in prison.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 Mar (NA) -- Defense Minister Oscar 
Camilion today said the Armed Forces "categorically reject the 
possibility of joining the antinarcotic effort, for which they 
feel neither competent nor inclined." 
  The minister said the Armed Forces' non-engagement in the 
antinarcotics fight is due to the fact that "there are the 
necessary organizations to do it like the Border Police, the 
Argentine Coast Guard, and the Federal Police." 
  "There are countries in which the armed forces have to 
intervene because they do not have those security 
organizations," the minister said. "The Armed Forces 
categorically reject the possibility of joining antinarcotic 
efforts, for which they feel neither competent nor inclined." 
  In this regard, he assured that Argentina "does not have the 
problems of other countries, where drug traffickers make 
themselves the owners of land areas." 
  Concerning U.S. "pressure" for the military to join the 
antinarcotics fight, he said: "It is their problem to 
permanently insist on that fight, just as we insist that they 
should halt drug consumption among their population." 
  On the other hand, Camilion denied press reports that 
President Carlos Menem advocates the engagement of the military 
in domestic intelligence work. 
  The minister said the Armed Forces will only "extend 
logistical support" in case of domestic disturbances, like the 
one that occurred in December in Santiago del Estero, although 
he admitted that government members followed this specific case 
with "concern." 
  Camilion maintained that the government "has no intention" 
of 
making the Armed Forces join domestic intelligence work, adding 
that he received "neither formally nor informally, neither 
directly nor indirectly," any indication in this regard from 
President Menem or Presidency Secretary General Eduardo Bauza. 
  In statements to journalists after opening the academic year 
of the School of National Defense, which is subordinated to his 
portfolio, Camilion recalled that the Armed Forces are ruled by 
defense and internal security laws, and he categorically denied 
that the "amendment" of such laws is being studied. 
  He also categorically denied that the United States has made 
any reference to the possibility of the military taking action 
in case of an eventual social outbreak in Argentina. 
  He added he was not concerned about the stay in Chile of 
former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, denying that a 
military power imbalance can be caused in the region in case of 
the possible purchase of military equipment by the Chilean 
Government. 
  "We would only be concerned about Chilean purchases of 
British weapons if Chile were insinuating the possibility of 
creating a power imbalance in the region; but the truth is that 
we have just arrived from Chile, and we have not seen anything 
that might cause concern in this regard," the minister added. 
  Concerning the statement by Thatcher in Chile, Camilion 
emphatically rejected the remarks by the former British prime 
minister that the Malvinas islands war facilitated the return of 
democracy in Argentina. 
  In this regard, he said: "Both Argentina and all of Latin 
America have a strongly democratic tradition."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 22 Mar (NA) -- Alberto Lestelle, 
secretary for the prevention of drug abuse, denied today that 
the U.S. Government has "imposed decisions or exerted pressure" 
in order that the "repentant" figure be included in Argentine 
legislation on narcotics. He also reiterated that the Armed 
Forces "will have no direct participation" in the struggle 
against drug trafficking. 
  Lestelle explained that the inclusion of the figure 
"repentant" in the legislation had already been foreseen "before 
the visit by U.S. Vice President Al Gore." 
  Lestelle said that the government sent the bill to Congress 
in 1992, and that in addition to the repentant figure it also 
included the role of the "informer," release on one's own 
recognizance, and the undercover agent. 
  He also denied that the "freezing" of the initiative 
coincided with the alleged link of Amira Yoma, former 
presidential protocol director, to the money laundering case 
known as Narcogate. 
  In this regard Lestelle said: "The question should be asked 
of the members of the Penal and Drug Addiction Committees, who 
never debated the issue." 
  Lestelle added that 30 days ago the government submitted to 
the legislature a bill modifying the previous one, and that 
coordination would be done with the respective committees on the 
possibility of drawing up a single bill so that "it can be 
approved as soon as possible." 
  Regarding the possibility of including the Armed Forces in 
the struggle against drug trafficking, Lestelle said to Radio 
Continental that the government "has decided that they will have 
no direct participation." 
  Lestelle explained, however, that "logically, a security 
organization could ask the Armed Forces for radar support if, 
for example, it is known that an airplane is about to take off 
from a neighboring country." 
  He added: "In any case, once the airplane lands in Argentine 
territory the operation will continue, but will be under the 
jurisdiction of the National Border Police." He confirmed that 
the participation of the Armed Forces in intelligence is 
"absolutely ruled out."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 Mar (NA) -- The draft bill on 
industrial property -- correctly called invention and utility 
models patents [patentes de invencion y modelos de utilidad] -- 
that the PEN [national executive branch] submitted to Congress 
remains virtually paralyzed, in view of the reticence of 
legislators, who do not believe the U.S. threat to sanction 
Argentina by denying it entry to NAFTA if the draft bill is not 
approved before 30 April. 
  This was stated yesterday by legislative sources, who 
explained that there is no concrete information on the positions 
of the members of the Health, Science and Technology, Commerce, 
Industry, Penal Affairs, or Prison System Commissions in the 
Senate, who are the ones who have to discuss the draft bill. 
  Carlos Menem's initiative responds directly to the 
requirements of the government of Bill Clinton, according to the 
sources, which on the other hand stated that when the issue is 
formally debated by these commissions "there will be some who 
will point out at least five points of the draft bill that are 
harmful to Argentine interests." 
  More than one of the legislative branch sources noted that 
between the U.S. position and GATT requirements there is a broad 
range of possibilities for reaching an "adequate" Argentine 
patents law that would satisfy all sectors, and would even 
settle the "infighting" within the national government over 
precisely this subject. 
  According to speculation within the legislative branch, if 
the draft bill has the approval of almost all the senators -- 
although amended -- it might then meet serious obstacles in the 
Chamber of Deputies. 
  In view of the strong pressure exerted by the United States 
regarding this future law, the senators wonder what joining 
NAFTA will mean to Argentina and "what benefits and difficulties 
it will hold for the country." 
  Although it is true that Argentina has a "good relationship 
with the United States," it is also believed that "there is no 
need to join NAFTA" to maintain this relationship, as "it is not 
very clear what the benefits would be" if Argentina is chosen to 
become a member of this commercial bloc other than to "encourage 
confidence and the flow of capital." 
  While these doubts exist, the Justicialist Party bloc of 
national senators has still not explained its stance regarding 
the government's draft bill, and it is believed it will not do 
so until after 10 April, because the great majority have decided 
to remain in their respective provinces to carry out their 
electoral campaign for the election of members of the 
Constituent Assembly. 
  The senators' greatest specific objections to the PEN draft 
bill concern the shortening of the duration of 20 year patents, 
as it creates monopolies and because the speed of innovations 
today makes it inadvisable, according to the models of other 
countries that are influencing several legislators. 
  Some senators are studying the possibility of "shortening 
the 
transition period for pharmaceutical products" or of 
establishing an extension for the patents for a period that 
could be three years, "under the condition that national 
laboratories be granted a license." 
  They also propose "restricting the exploitation concept to 
local production, as is established in Spanish law," and 
allowing importation only in exceptional cases. This is a 
confusion that exists in the production of and trading in 
products from foreign laboratories. 
  Another point under discussion is that referring to the 
possibility of allowing importation with the requirement of 
paying "royalties" in order to encourage competition and avoid 
the establishment of monopolies. 
  Some legislators want to "avoid a retroactive patent and 
eliminate what is labeled `priority,' and only grant patents for 
new products." 
  Finally they point out the need to establish "explicit 
mechanisms to encourage investigation and development." 
  Several consulted senators agreed that Argentine industry is 
ready to investigate, market, and pull out of its isolation, and 
"begin to compete based on a technological plan and the 
country's industrial know-how, as well as defend the consumer."

  [Text] La Rioja, 18 Mar (NA) -- The Provinces of Santa Fe 
and Entre Rios today reached agreement and settled their veiled 
disputes over the functioning of the Constituent Assembly. 
Governors Carlos Reutemann and Mario Moine signed a document 
outlining the guidelines for the assembly which will modify the 
Constitution. 
  The ceremony for signing of the document -- initially 
scheduled for yesterday, but postponed because it was impossible 
for Reutemann and Moine to travel to this city -- was held at 
the provincial Government House. The ceremony was also attended 
by La Rioja Governor Bernabe Arnaudo and Acting Senate President 
Eduardo Menem. 
  Also present were Parana Mayor Julio Solanas, Santa Fe Mayor 
Jorge Obeid, and Domingo Carlos Trulla, the chairman of the 
Supreme Court of La Rioja. 
  The text signed by Reutemann and Moine has eight points, the 
first of which states that the agreement seeks to "formulate a 
proposal for the distribution of the functions of the 
Constituent Assembly between the two cities." 
  The agreement states that Parana will handle the 
inauguration 
of the Assembly, the special sessions, and the closing session 
-- for which the Entre Rios provincial Government will provide 
the Tres de Febrero Municipal Theater. 
  Meanwhile, Santa Fe will host the Constituent Assembly 
plenary sessions and the board of Assembly authorities and 
secreariats, for which the Reutemann's Santa Fe administration 
will provide "the esplanade of the Litoral University and the 
facilities which may be needed for authorities, secretariats, 
and assistants." 
  The document also establishes that advisory committees will 
be housed "in places established by the Constituent Assembly, 
seeking an equitable distribution between the cities of Santa Fe 
and Parana." The new Constitution will be approved and sworn-in 
at San Jose Palace, in Concepcion del Uruguay, as previously 
announced. 
  Arnaudo said that because the agreement was signed in this 
capital "it will be recorded in La Rioja's history," adding that 
"the province is once again the stage for major national events." 
  "We are committed to this process of change, promoting a 
national consensus for recreating the Constitution to match the 
new model of Argentina," Arnaudo said, emphasizing the 
importance of "introducing needed changes at this time of 
economic and social transformation." 
  Moine highlighted the significance of the agreement "at this 
historic moment." He said: "Never before have the majority 
parties -- which represent the will of 80 or 85 percent of 
Argentines -- reached a consensus for this reform that is so 
necessary." 
  Moine emphasized that the reform "does not relate to the 
present, but with the future," adding that reforming the 
Constitution is a "contribution to the common good." He 
promised to "do his best to fulfill the objectives outlined in 
this document." 
  Reutemann thanked Senator Eduardo Menem "for everything he 
did toward a successful outcome," noting that "when Sante Fe and 
Entre Rios were chosen to house the event, everyone began to 
speculate about the difficulties that would arise between the 
governors." 
  Finally, Senator Menem -- the first cadidate for Constituent 
Assembly member for the Justicialist Party of La Rioja -- said: 
"Many times, those who play a role do not realize they are 
making history," adding that "many events in Argentina and in 
the world were achieved by men who were unaware they were making 
history." 
  "We know that, with the constitutional reform, we are 
rewriting history, a history that stems from the past and 
projects itself into the future," Menem said, noting that the 
election of Santa Fe and Parana as the seats of the Constituent 
Assembly "acknowledges their major role in organizing the 
country."

  [Text] The annual session of the Chinese People's Congress 
ended today with a call to continue political and economic 
reforms. The 3,000 deputies were urged to work to balance the 
national reforms, development, and stability. 
  Premier Li Peng has warned the United States that China is a 
sovereign country and will not negotiate or agree to anything in 
detriment to its self-determination. Li Peng said he expected 
better results during the visit of U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher between 11 and 14 March. That trip was 
preceded by a broad campaign against alleged Chinese human 
rights violations, in which Beijing was threatened with 
withdrawal of most favored nation status in bilateral trade.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina today said 
that his tour of eight Asian countries was successful. He said 
that in the future Cuba will implement a diplomatic offensive 
policy because we are tired of being on the stand as a defendant. 
  Robaina said that in Vietnam he is concluding what has been 
announced as a diplomatic offensive through several regions in 
the world with the purpose of explaining to several governments 
the truth about our country and studying our economic 
experiences. 
  Our tours of the Caribbean, some Latin American nations, 
Africa, and now Asia, have conveyed to our interlocutors a broad 
vision of the process Cuba is experiencing, within a climate of 
respect and understanding, Robaina said. 
  He added that in these contacts Cuba has found elbow room to 
personally explain the current Cuban situation and to say what 
the great news media fail to say. 
  Our country is not the hell it is said to be nor the heaven 
we would like it to be, and for this reason it should not be on 
the stand as a defendant, Robaina said. From this moment on we 
are going to begin a diplomatic offensive in an effort to 
consolidate our legitimate aspirations and to expand our 
international relations. 
  During a news conference held in Vietnam, Robaina said that 
we are a country open for dialogue, willing to negotiate 
everything, except our independence, sovereignty, and 
revolutionary achievements. 
  The Cuban foreign minister said that 1994 will be a year of 
intensive work which includes a new tour of some Latin American 
nations in the beginning of April. 
  On concluding his visit to Vietnam, Robaina added that his 
project includes a visit to the Middle East in the near future, 
but before that his country will host the conference between the 
nation and the emigre community, a meeting with the Cuban 
community abroad. 
  Robaina said that the conference will be held in Havana 
between 22 and 24 April with the participation of Cuban citizen 
who reside in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Venezuela, 
Argentina, the Caribbean, and other countries. 
  Robaina went on to say that the objective of the meeting is 
to normalize ties between Cuba and its community abroad as all 
nations do. All Cubans of goodwill are invited to participate. 
Only the hysterical and agressive ones are not invited, he said. 
  On analyzing his current tour of Asian countries, the Cuban 
foreign minister stressed the importance of exchanging ideas and 
analyzing economic experiences. He said that Vietnam was the 
most relevant point of his tour due to the traditional bilateral 
ties of friendship and cooperation, and he concluded by saying 
that he was surprised at the achievements of this Asian country.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived in Ho Chi 
Minh City today, where he was greeted by Vo Tran Chi, member of 
the Politburo and first secretary of this city's party 
committee. At this meeting, Robaina explained to Vo Tran Chi 
that Cuba is immersed in a process of change in which the 
people's participation is essential. 
  Robaina, who is on the last leg of an Asian tour that 
included eight Southeast Asian countries, pointed out that Cuba 
is making many changes and that there are many still to come. 
Robaina said that Cuba wants to learn first-hand from the 
experiences of a brother such as Vietnam, to which we are linked 
not only by economic ties but by auspicious and frank 
traditional ties. He added that Cuba is in a process of recovery 
that is dependent on the efforts and work of the Cuban people. 
Robaina stressed that what has most caught his attention in 
Vietnam is the way the party controls and directs the economic 
reforms. 
  Vo Tran Chi said that there are many spheres in which the 
two 
countries can hold exchanges with a view to overcoming the 
current circumstances. The Cuban delegation will also meet with 
local officials and tour sites of economic interest. 
  Ho Chi Minh City, which has a population of 5 million, is 
considered Vietnam's most important commercial hub.

<F P=106> [By Luis Orlando Pantoja] </F>
  [Text] In the midst of intensive discussions within the 
national Cuban Workers Federation [CTC], an analysis was made of 
the experience and the results of parliaments in workplaces in 
the city of Havana. The meeting was presided over by Politburo 
members Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government; Jorge Lezcano, first 
secretary of the Cuban Communist Party in the city of Havana; 
and Pedro Ross Leal, CTC Secretary General; along with Alfredo 
Morales, top union leader in the city of Havana. 
  Alfredo Morales read a detailed report on the main proposals 
submitted by the Havana workers. The report also makes a 
political assessment of these heated discussions in which a 
spirit of willingness to carry out our main tasks stands out. 
  A group of participants in the meeting also gave their 
opinions on the report and on the parliaments. They underscored 
such aspects as a greater demand by the administration to 
control resources, costs, accounting, labor discipline, and 
other essential matters. 
  Several suggestions on the banks' role in receiving payments 
and in paying accounts by different organizations; the need for 
efficiency indicators to be posted in each workplace; the 
reduction of annual sick leave figures; and the need to 
subsidize consumers rather than products, among other topics, 
were some of the most debated points. 
  Jorge Lezcano thoroughly explained the country's economic 
situation, namely in Havana city. He stressed the political 
outcome of this process, the need to continue the process and 
made an analysis of the salary tax, currency exchange, labor 
discipline, and the attitude toward the money hoarders [macetas]. 
  He made it clear that workers will not be laid off but that 
the measures adopted will surely imply sacrifices and that these 
measures would be in effect for some time. Costs are the key 
factors in the economic efficiency process, Lazcano concluded. 
  Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada also stressed the need to find 
efficiency as a result of internal measures and not by 
increasing prices. He also underscored the need to review the 
inflated payrolls, to prioritize self-consumption areas, 
stressing that there was no need to wait for the National 
Assembly, that decisions must be made concerning everything that 
can be implemented in the workplaces. Alarcon also made a 
valuable assessment of the Cuban socioeconomic situation before 
1959. 
  In conclusion, Pedro Ross Leal stressed the importance of 
keeping up this style of work and the need to strengthen it. He 
said we must now continue with the second stage of parliaments 
which consists of implementing measures in each workplace and 
discussing them with workers.

  [Text] Important improvements are being made to the Frank 
Pais International Airport in Holguin. Excavation has begun 
where a new international terminal is to be built. The terminal 
is to have a 600-passenger capacity, divided between incoming 
and outgoing passengers. The airport will also have a fuel 
storage facility adjacent to the new terminal. 
  This year the Ministry of Construction will spend over 4 
million pesos on equipment, construction, and installations. Of 
this total, it already possesses 10 percent in freely 
convertible currency. 
  Engineer (Francisco Wilford), head of Cubana [de Aviacion's] 
Assembly Department, explained that a brigade of experts from 
the city of Havana, Camaguey, and Holguin is installing the 
runway lights and the ILS instrument landing system, which will 
provide greater safety for all airport operations. 
  When these projects are finished in the first half of 1995, 
the Holguin airport, a National Vanguard airport for two 
consecutive years, will be able to provide better service to 
domestic and foreign travelers. 
  This year, airport officials intend to meet the airport's 
self-financing plan by earning hard currency, as well as to 
expand the work of ANIR [National Association of Innovators and 
Efficiency Experts] and to make their technical and economic 
plan a reality.

  [Text] This is what the television signal broadcast for the 
first time from Granma looked like. This is an old dream of this 
eastern region. Several tests have been conducted, and the 
specialists say that, except for the town of Buey Arriba, the 
signal reaches every municipality in the province strongly. 
Certain antennas have been rotated and others installed, making 
it possible to broadcast the signal from the center of Bayamo. 
Efforts to have a television station in Granma Province, though 
optimistic, have not yet borne fruit, since most of the 
equipment, which comes from abroad, is lacking. 
  Those of you who have seen this signal on your television 
set 
may find it interesting to know that it was broadcast using this 
Television Serrana cassette player or the videotape recorder 
from the office of the NTV correspondent. 
  Work is under way with a view to organizing a first, weekly, 
30-minute program, which will of course be broadcast employing 
the minimal equipment we mentioned. 
  Also, the effort made by the Communications Ministry makes 
it 
possible for Granma Province to receive the signal from 
Holguin's (Tele Cristal) with top quality.

part of the current budget period available to the general 
public. 
  "The strategy of the current government, headed by Dr. 
Joaquin Balaguer, the president of the Republic, calls for 
distributing the public funds on the basis of the essential 
priorities to the agricultural, irrigation, drinking water, 
energy, health, and education sectors, without excluding other

project, as well as the building and repair of canals and the 
maintenance of other dams. The Dominican Electricity Corporation 
received 62,372,028.51 pesos to cover the commitments of that 
institution and to help with the improvements of the energy 
system in our country. 
  "The Dominican Agrarian Institute (IAD) received 
16,356,287.47 pesos for the implementation of various projects 
and the financing of a number of farm programs. The State Sugar 
Council received 50 million pesos for launching the harvest at 
five sugar mills. The Farm Bank received 85 million pesos for 
the execution of the Northwest Small Producers Project and the

Puerto Plata, San Pedro de Macoris, San Cristobal, La Vega, and 
Duverge aqueducts, as well as others in various localities in

  [Text] On 31 December of last year, the Central Bank had 
total reserves in foreign exchange amounting to $736 million, 
the highest figure in history. 
  This reserve total showed an increase of $155 million over 
the figure at the end of 1992, the public relations department 
of the bank reported. 
  With reserves at this level, the institution will be able to 
cover any unusual increase in foreign exchange, thus avoiding 
the creation of distortions in the exchange rate. 
  It will also be able to cover the payment obligations to be 
met on the basis of the plans for this year. 
  Concerning the sales of foreign exchange to the commercial 
banks, it was reported that in the last two days of the week, 
the Central Bank sold $25 million at the exchange rate of 12.50 
Dominican pesos, plus the bank commission of 2 percent. 
  The result of this injection of dollars into the foreign 
exchange market was the demonetization of 319 million pesos. 
  The exchange rate of 12.50 pesos becomes 12.75 with the 
addition of the bank commission of 2 percent, the official rate 
being multiplied by a factor of 1.02. 
  The volume of dollars injected into the market at the 
effective exchange rate of 12.75 pesos generated the 19 million 
pesos that were demonetized, the public relations department 
reported. 
  With the participation of the Central Bank on the market 
through the purchase and sale of foreign exchange, it will be 
able to maintain a liquidity volume in Dominican pesos that is 
sufficient for a healthy level of growth in the economy, the 
report said. 
  It added that this will be done without affecting price 
stability, the real rate of exchange, or the macroeconomic 
aggregates achieved beginning in 1991. 
  The injections of foreign exchange into the market may serve 
various purposes. One of these would be to obtain Dominican 
pesos with a view to demonetization, in order to continue the 
restriction of the means of payment in general and to control 
the currency in circulation. 
  Another choice would be to inject dollars into the market 
for 
the purpose of keeping the exchange rate stable and avoiding a 
certain increase therein. 
  The injection of foreign exchange has been effected by the 
Central Bank at the official exchange rate, without regard to 
the existing rate on the free foreignexchange market. 
  The bank added that in its view, the economic development of 
the nation, in terms of economic growth with price and foreign 
exchange stability, has been "the outstanding characteristic of 
the Dominican economy." 
  This is how it has described the situation in its reports to 
international bodies, the source added.

  [Text] The United States pointed out on 22 March that it is 
important for the Haitian Senate to pass -- and soon -- the 
parliamentary plan for solving the crisis. U.S. Ambassador 
William Lacy Swing has warned that any Senate member who would 
prevent the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional 
responsibilities will be considered by the U.S. Government to be 
acting in disregard of the New York pact. 
  Mr. Swing was referring to the senators elected in the 18 
January 1993 elections, not acknowledged by the international 
community. Ambassador Swing reminded them of their 
responsibility to fully and officially respect the commitments 
to which they subscribed within the framework of the New York 
pact. 
  This pact, made in July 1993 by Haiti's antagonistic 
political forces, provides for those [contested] 
parliamentarians to refrain from sitting in parliament until a 
solution is found regarding their status. 
  The Haitian Senate is divided into two antagonistic blocs: 
one led by Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, recognized by the 
international community; the other by Sen. Bernard Sansaricq, 
whom the unacknowledged senators elected their leader. Only one 
of these [contested] senators, Serge Gilles [head of the 
Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti], a 
socialist official, continues to respect the New York pact. The 
others say the arbitration commitments provided for in this pact 
have not been respected. 
  The parliamentary plan for solving the Haitian crisis 
provides for the early retirement of General Raoul Cedras, head 
of the Army, before a new prime minister takes office -- but 
sets no date for the return of exiled President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide to Haiti.

  [Excerpts] Dejean Belizaire has thumped the table with his 
fist. Belizaire, president of the Alliance for Parliamentary 
Cohesion [ACP], has shouted: Meddling! In Belizaire's opinion, 
it is not up to U.S. Ambassador to Haiti William Lacy Swing to 
ask the parliamentarians elected on 18 January to respect the 
New York pact. The following is a report by Daly Valet: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] The nation's political 
crisis has begun to deteriorate. The problems of the high cost 
of living and the blackouts have turned the country, especially 
Port- au-Prince, into a hell. If the political authorities fail 
to take action, there could be social explosions leading to 
civil war in Haiti. Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer has not 
ruled out this danger, because hunger drives the wolf out of the 
woods. 
  The U.S. Government also is aware of the fact that the worst 
can happen if the country's political crisis continues. This is 
why William Lacy Swing, U.S. ambassador to Haiti, has turned 
into a malevolent, master voodoo priest [yon papa boko] who 
wishes to bring the zombies that the Governors Island agreement 
and New York pact constitute back to life. The ambassador has 
disinterred the dead bodies of these two political documents, 
and is asking all the signers to respect their signatures. 
  Regarding the [contested] parliamentarians elected on 18 
January, the U.S. ambassador is very firm: He has asked them to 
respect the New York pact, which requires them to abstain [from 
participating in parliamentary activity]. This has angered 
Dejean Belizaire. 
  [Belizaire] To become senator, on 18 January 1993, I 
campaigned under the slogan: The nation's independence is in 
danger. We must defend it. So I can hardly understand how today 
I, a senator of the Republic and a Haitian citizen, could be in 
such a situation, to have to obey orders given by Mr. Swing. 
Dejean Belizaire is a legitimate citizen. The parliamentarians 
elected on 18 January are legitimate citizens. We are therefore 
telling the ambassador that he has gone too far in his meddling 
in the country's internal affairs. 
  They may be able to give orders to President Aristide, but 
they cannot give orders to the senators elected on 18 January. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Valet] The U.S. ambassador's statements have angered the 
entire group of legislators elected on 18 January. All of them 
have used nationalistic words to reply to the ambassador, and 
have spoken of meddling and violation of the senators' 
independence. Margareth Martin is even more radical in her 
reaction. Her main demands are that the New York pact be 
declared null and void, that the country's president be 
impeached, and [that] Article 149 [be implemented]. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

  [Excerpt] On Friday, 18 March, Pope John Paul II renewed 
the call for dialogue with all the components of Haitian society 
that he had issued on 15 January. It is up to the Haitians, he 
stated in a speech to the Haitian bishops who came to Rome on 
their quinquennial visit, to build their future based on the 
principles about which you have reminded them recently. The 
pope mentioned in his speech Haiti's numerous problems to which 
are added, he said, the obsessive problems created by the 
political instability and the economic embargo and most of all 
the shattering show of a nation in distress which is struggling 
day after day in order to survive. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Message to the nation by Mexican President Carlos Salinas </F>
de Gortari from Los Pinos presidential palace in Mexico City on 
23 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] Compatriots, a few minutes ago an odious attack was 
carried out against Luis Donaldo Colosio. It is an action that 
deeply hurts us, and me particularly, because this is an attack 
on a human being. In addition, it is against a noble man, a 
good man, who seeks to serve others and to serve his country. I 
have already heard many voices express their consternation with 
this incident and their all-out rejection of this attack. I am 
in constant contact to learn about Colosio's condition. I have 
sent my sympathy to his family. I have sent my personal 
physician and an expert to help the doctors attending him. 
  I have been informed that arrests have been made. I have 
given instructions to the attorney general to travel to Tijuana 
to help in the investigation. We will get to the bottom of this 
and the full weight of the law shall be applied. 
  The most important thing right now is Luis Donaldo Colosio's 
health. I am certain that if we all join in our sentiments of

  [Text] Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis stated a 
few minutes ago in Chiapas that the attack on PRI candidate Luis 
Donaldo Colosio is an attack against peace and against the 
nation. Camacho Solis said a few minutes ago that he joins in 
with all Mexicans to reject the attack perpetrated this 
afternoon against Luis Donaldo Colosio. What happened, said 
Colosio, is a big offense against his family and against all of 
us. Here is Juan Carlos Antoyo reporting from Chiapas. 
  [Antoyo] Camacho Solis was to give a report, a summary on 
the 
Chiapas situation. We were summoned at 1900 [0100 GMT] but the 
message did not arrive. Suddenly there was silence and reactions 
were soon felt; the news was released. Manuel Camacho Solis 
arrived one hour later to give this brief statement that he had 
written by hand on a piece of paper. The following is his 
message: 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] The information I was to 
release today will be made known in the following days. I have 
just communicated with Mexico City and was told that Luis 
Donaldo Colosio is in the hands of the best Mexican doctors. I 
join the whole nation's indignation for the attack against Luis 
Donaldo Colosio's life. What occurred is an attack against 
peace and democracy in the nation. The highest value is the 
individual's life and his dignity. What has occurred is a great 
offense against his family, all our families, and the nation. 
[end recording] 
  [Antoyo] This is all Camacho Solis said.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Carlos Castillo Peraza, president </F>
of the National Action Party, by Javier Zabludovsky -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Castillo] Mr. Zabludovsky. I want to officially 
communicate on the part of the National Action Party [PAN] that 
our party is suspending its presidential campaign until things 
return to normal, out of respect for political equality and in 
solidarity with the sorrow of Candidate Colosio's family and 
because of our desire to help national emotions calm down and so 
that sense and prudence will prevail. 
  Also, I want to tell you that I am in contact with Hector 
Osuna, PAN mayor of Tijuana, who gave me the following report: 
Yesterday, those responsible for security for Mr. Colosio's 
delegation met with the mayor and with the person in charge of 
security and asked them for all their support for Candidate 
Colosio's tour. It was given immediately. The group charged 
with security for Mr. Colosio said they only needed four patrol 
cars because they did not foresee anything serious happening 
except for maybe some demonstrations by some dissidents or 
groups opposed to the PRI. Because of this, they were given 
four patrol cars to clear the way for the presidential 
candidate's delegation. This was confirmed this morning in a 
breakfast with some members of the Army also in charge of 
security and with Mr. Benitez, who is in charge of public 
security for Baja California. I am saying this, so that it will 
be clear that the PAN mayor of Tijuana offered as much help as 
was requested. The persons in charge of security were not 
anticipating anything serious except for perhaps some small 
demonstrations by dissidents of the PRI in Tijuana. 
  [Zabludovsky] Do you mean that the scarce vigilance in 
Tijuana Municipality, whose mayor is a member of the PAN, was 
because the organizers of Mr. Colosio's rally felt that more 
security was not needed? 
  [Castillo] That is right, sir. They only asked for four 
patrol cars when the mayor's office was willing to give them 
whatever they needed. They were given exactly what they asked 
for. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Speech By Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari from </F>
Los Pinos Presidential Palace; monitored in progress -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Text] ...Luis Donaldo Colosio has died today. This is a 
deeply indignant fact. It is a fact that offends us. It is an 
offense against all Mexicans and the institutions that we have 
built throughout our history. It has hurt the deepest 
convictions of the Mexican people, who have always favored the 
path of harmony, law, and peace, who have always rejected 
violence as a method to solve our problems. 
  There is no political or moral reason that justifies 
violence 
in Mexico. It is an affront, because a climate of dialogue, 
understanding, and of consensus prevailed among the political 
forces, to direct the diverse proposals along the path of law 
and legal reform. It is an affront to the PRI members, to the 
Sonora residents, and also to all Mexicans. 
  We do not accept that enemies of Mexico seek to twist the 
path of law and harmony. The loss of Luis Donaldo Colosio is 
the most profound call for Mexicans to remain united, to revive 
the awareness that we are people of great moral strength, and 
that in the face of adversity, we know how to make use of our 
values and energy to strengthen the firmness of our institutions. 
  As president of the Republic, I am determined to act 
forcefully. I will ensure that the law is applied rigorously and 
that this crime will be fully clarified. Nobody is above the 
law. Mexicans must be sure that the Constitution and the law 
will be complied with at all times. 
  I am making a call for harmony. I have received from 
political and party leaders expressions of their conviction and 
commitment to act responsibly in keeping with the new 
circumstances. We will maintain our regime of freedom and the 
constitutional order. 
  As a Mexican, and as a friend of Luis Donaldo Colosio, I 
have 
a lot of affection to offer to his family, his wife Diana Laura, 
his son Luis Donaldo, and his daughter Mariana. Their pain is 
not beyond me, and I will try to ease their loss with my closest 
friendship. 
  I urge all my compatriots to remain calm despite their 
indignation. I call on you to reaffirm our shared conviction 
that we will be able to overcome this aggravation within the 
framework of the institutions and the law. 
  The greatest show of love for Mexico and faith in its future 
at this time will be accomplished by reinforcing our unity and 
ensuring that our voice of harmony, as one people, is heard in 
all parts of our homeland and the entire world.

recently worked in a funeral parlor in Tijuana. That would

  [Text] Last night in Tijuana, Diego Valadez, attorney 
general of the republic, said that the authorities will strictly 
abide by the law, applying its full weight against those 
responsible for the murder of PRI presidential candidate Luis 
Donaldo Colosio Murrieta. 
  Upon arrival at Tijuana General Hospital, where Luis Donaldo 
Colosio died of two gunshot wounds, Attorney General Diego 
Valadez said he has been specifically instructed by President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari to direct the investigation. The 
president of the Republic appointed (Santiago Unate Laborde), 
one of Luis Donaldo Colosio's close collaborators, to be special 
prosecutor in charge of investigating the attack. 
  Diego Valadez reported that officials from the Attorney 
General's Office [PGR] will participate in the investigations in 
order to clarify the events that took place at 1708 Tijuana 
time, which is 1908 Mexico City time [0108 GMT]. 
  The PGR official confirmed that two people have been 
arrested. He pointed out that his office will release 
information to the public as the investigation proceeds. 
  At approximately 2230 Tijuana time, which is 0030 Mexico 
City 
time [0630 GMT], the PGR issued a communique in Tijuana, in 
which it confirmed that the person who shot and killed Luis 
Donaldo Colosio has confessed that he fired four times on Luis 
Donaldo Colosio. Only two shots, fired from a .38 special 
revolver, hit Luis Donaldo Colosio, one in the abdomen and the 
other behind the right ear. 
  Prior to entering the area where Colosio Murrieta's remains 
were being held, the attorney general of the republic insisted 
that justice and the law will prevail in Mexico and that firm 
action will be taken to clear up absolutely everything.

<F P=106> [From the "Good Morning From Mexico" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Raul Sanchez Carrizo reports that two people have 
been arrested in connection with the killing of PRI presidential 
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
  You have already seen the two assassins on your TV screens. 
One of them is Mario Aburto Martinez, 23. There are two 
alleged killers. They are already under arrest. One of them 
fired at the PRI candidate. He is on screen right now. He is 
Mario Aburto Martinez, 23. This morning, the Tijuana State 
Prosecutor's Office conducted a Harrison Test on him, and the 
test was positive. The Prosecutor's Office reports this confirms 
that the suspect had indeed fired a gun. 
  Preliminary Investigation No. 739-94 initiated in the 
killing 
of Luis Donaldo Colosio indicates Aburto Martinez used a .38 
caliber pistol. The investigation also says the suspect is from 
Zamora, Michoacan, where he lived until age 15. 
  Aburto Martinez said in his initial statement that he is not 
going to talk, even if he is tortured. This is in line with the 
disdainful disposition that, according to witnesses, he assumed 
after attacking the presidential candidate. At the moment of 
his apprehension by an angry crowd, he bragged he had fired on 
Colosio. 
  Preliminary investigations have established that the alleged 
assassin lives in Mexicali and also has a residence in Tijuana, 
that he has four brothers who live in the United States, and 
that he works in a mechanic shop in Buenos Aires Norte 
neighborhood, in (Mesa de Otay), Tijuana. 
  He said he is the author of pacifist books that he has 
already delivered to the foreign media. 
  Amid a great deal of secrecy, the Federal Attorney General's 
Office is also interrogating Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, a man 
arrested as a witness [testigo]. Mayoral Valenzuela is also 
from the border city of Tijuana. 
  Attorney General Diego Valadez has been in that city since 
last night.

<F P=106> [By Alfonso Barea] </F>
  [Text] Mexico City, 24 Mar (EFE) -- Thousands of enraged 
supporters of the PRI have taken to the streets of Mexico City 
to demand justice in connection with the assassination of PRI 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
  PRI supporters who gathered in front of party headquarters 
in 
this capital a few minutes before the report that Colosio had 
died on the operating table at Tijuana General Hospital have 
repeatedly called for justice and unity. 
  Throughout the night, however, calls for unity were 
intermingled with shouts of "Colosio, yes; Camacho, no" from PRI 
militants who could not hold back their tears. Colosio's 
rivalry with Manuel Camacho Solis, the commissioner of peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas, to succeed Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
as Mexico's president had continued even after Colosio was 
designated as the party's official candidate. Last night, many 
PRI militants warned the party leadership that they would not 
tolerate the former foreign minister's becoming president. 
  A group of women who had gathered outside PRI headquarters 
proclaimed: "We want justice." The tense and emotional 
situation that pervaded the site exploded the moment officials 
and militants heard on television that the candidate had died. 
While some people cried in offices, other militants tried to 
organize public meetings by party leaders while unsuccessfully 
trying to keep back thousands of people who had gathered outside 
the building. 
  A woman near a table covered with candles said, "There are 
many traitors, and it is not good to divide the country." The 
people nearby applauded her, apparently understanding the 
meaning of her statement. 
  The people shouted party slogans and expressions of support 
for Colosio, but they did not heed a suggestion to sing a 
"corrido [a traditional folk genre in which a person's life or 
accomplishments are praised in song] for Colosio" in honor of 
the candidate. 
  Colosio's followers remain gathered around the PRI building, 
where they will hold a vigil today when Colosio's body is 
brought to a chapel to be installed at the PRI headquarters.

<F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Otero] </F>
  [Text] Luis German Carcova, president of the Business 
Coordinating Council, has made a spirited appeal to foreign 
investors not to withdraw from the Mexican Stock Market -- a 
most volatile market. 
  The council has urged national and foreign investors who 
have 
capital investments in Mexico to remain calm and not to make 
hasty decisions. Luis German Carcova said the best way to 
demonstrate a love for the country is to confront the situation 
and to keep working. 
  [Begin Carcova recording] We ask them to remain calm and to 
look at and analyze the situation carefully. We have to 
determine within the next few hours how to best face this 
situation. I am certain we will be able to resolve this 
situation and that the Mexican people will continue to move 
ahead. No one can stop us, and no one will. 
  We ask them to remain calm and not to make hasty decisions. 
This is a time to demonstrate maturity and love for our 
country. One of the best ways businessmen and investors can 
demonstrate this love is by not splitting up, but, as the saying 
goes, by sticking to their guns -- namely, work, investments, 
and the generation of wealth and jobs. [end recording] 
  Carcova said he is angry about the assassination of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio. [words indistinct] a leader of organized 
businessmen, has said that in Mexico there are groups interested 
in destabilizing the nation. The murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio 
is clear evidence of this, he said. 
  In an interview at Los Pinos, Manuel Robleda, president of 
the Mexican Stock Market, did not want, or was unable, to 
predict what repercussions this event might have on the stock 
market.

chaired by Porfirio Munoz Ledo, to discuss the situation 
following the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio, PRI candidate. The 
following is a report of what happened early this morning at the 
PRD office. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] The PRD joined the 
country's political organizations unanimous rejection of the 
murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta. PRD presidential 
candidate Cuahtemoc Cardenas has voiced his sorrow for the 
violent action that took the life of the PRI candidate. He 
strongly condemned Colosio's murder and demanded it be 
immediately resolved. 
  [Cardenas] We deeply regret and strongly condemn this 
action, 
which should be resolved. All Mexicans, and particularly his 
family, must learn the motives that caused the Colosio's 
murderers to commit such a deplorable action. 
  [Reporter] Cardenas Solorzano, who met until very early this 
morning with the members of his party's National Council, has 
just suspended his campaign tour in Tlaxcala State. Cardenas 
said it is necessary to reestablish normalcy in the country's 
institutions, and added that the government has the obligation 
of guaranteeing the security of all citizens and those 
participating in the political events of the nation until the 
August elections are held. The elections will become the fulcrum 
to reestablishing the unity of all Mexicans. 
  [Cardenas] We must restore normalcy to the country's 
institutions. We must have full guarantees for the development 
of the country's normal everyday activities, including economic, 
social, and political activities. The government has the 
obligation of offering security to all citizens. The government 
must also provide security to all of us as we exercise our 
rights so political activities continue and culminate in the 
elections, which we believe must be the point that will 
reestablish the unity of all Mexicans. 
  [Reporter] The PRD candidate, who will personally present 
his 
condolences to the Colosio family and the PRI leadership, has 
urged citizens to remain united so that normalcy of the 
country's institutions can be restored as soon as possible. 
Cardenas Solorzano said that although he will continue with his 
electoral campaign as scheduled, he will modify his most recent 
calendar activities. 
  [Cardenas] For the time being, the trip we had planned to 
Oaxaca State will not take place, and we will closely follow 
what happens these next few days. We will watch to see what 
other organizations as well as the pro-government party will do. 
According to its own statutes, it will have to replace the 
candidate. We will see what it does. It will be a new event of 
great importance for the country. 
  [Reporter] The PRD candidate, who talked to the press after 
meeting with his party's National Council at his private office 
in Las Lomas, said he thought it unadvisable and risky to 
postpone the August elections. 
  [Cardenas] It would be more traumatic to think the elections 
will not be held. That is why we feel the elections should be 
held, regardless of the fact we know we are experiencing an 
extremely delicate situation. We can save our institutions and 
save the law by reaffirming the life of our institutions. [end

<F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The legislative wings in Congress support the 
Democratic Action [AD] proposal for the discussion of a special 
powers law that will allow the national Executive Branch to 
issue decrees on tax laws that are before the Legislative Branch. 
  With the exception of the Radical Cause Party and National 
Convergence, which are studying the AD proposal, the various 
legislative wings feel the special powers law will help us gain 
time in coping with the economic crisis, so long as the scope of 
the special powers law covers all solutions. 
  [Begin recording] [Movement Toward Socialism Deputy Gustavo 
Marquez] We believe that given the country's emergency situation 
as a result of the crisis in public finances and the treasury, 
it is fully justified to grant these powers to President Caldera 
so he will urgently issue the tax laws -- with which we are all 
familiar inasmuch as those drafts were presented to Congress 
--so it will be possible to significantly reduce the fiscal 
deficit. 
  [Social Action Party Deputy Nelson Chitty La Roche] That is 
the only reason AD and the rest of the country should be 
interested in expediting that process. In other words, we need 
to gain time. But I do not know if we have gained much time 
with the banking law, the stamp tax, and the judicial tariffs 
law, all of which were issued through the special powers granted 
to former President Velasquez. All of those measures are now 
being studied and will probably be modified and revised. 
Consequently, there are various issues that we must think about 
and decide upon. First we must consider the urgency of the 
legislation, something we do not deny. On the other hand, 
Congress can provide the best treatment a law needs. The 
Executive Branch is not meant to legislate in general but to 
implement laws. 
  [AD Deputy Pedro Tabata Guzman] The government has 
introduced 
a package of tax or fiscal measures known as the Sosa Plan. We 
must carefully study the many laws included in the plan, which 
could take no less than 60 or 90 days. Therefore, given the 
thorough analysis that this law package requires and the urgent 
requirement the government has for a legal instrument -- a very 
responsible instrument -- and after having spoken with all 
political forces, we submit for the consideration of the Chamber 
a special powers law that will allow the government to act 
rapidly and find a solution to the huge problems that all 
Venezuelans face. [end recording] 
  The various representatives of the parliamentarian wings 
said 
they were surprised at AD's proposal of a draft special powers 
law.

<F P=106> [Report by Carmen Castro at the Foreign Ministry] </F>
  [Text] Commenting on the Rio Group foreign ministers' 
meeting in Brazil, Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa stated that 
the Chilean Government is very willing to maintain good 
relations with Bolivia but that it is not opportune to deal with 
the outlet to the sea. 
  Figueroa met the Bolivian foreign minister, who considered 
the need for an outlet to the sea an important matter for his 
government. The Chilean reply was that it was not timely to 
discuss the issue. Figueroa, however, said there is goodwill 
toward Bolivia: 
  [Begin recording] Chile wishes to maintain very good 
relations with Bolivia, seek ways to reach an understanding on 
political, economic, cultural, tourism, investment, and 
infrastructure developments, and find peaceful solutions to 
border issues. That is, we can agree on many possibilities in 
our relations with Bolivia. [end recording] 
  Concerning the upcoming vote for the OAS secretary general 
scheduled to take place in Washington this week, Figueroa 
pointed out that the Chilean Government fully supports the Costa 
Rican candidate, former Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus. He said 
Chile honors its commitments, and recalled that in 1992 
President Aylwin and [Costa Rican President] Calderon made this 
commitment. 
  Figueroa also reported that the Rio Group member countries 
are arranging a future meeting with the EU where Chile will 
propose a new political relation between Europe and Latin 
America.

<F P=106> [Interview with Argentine Ambassador to the United States </F>
Raul Granillo Ocampo by Sergio Crivelli; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Crivelli] What is Argentina's real place on the 
United States' international agenda? 
  [Granillo Ocampo] The importance of the Argentine role is 
increasing. In the reformulation of the international scenario 
and in President Clinton's concept, Latin America is beginning 
to occupy a more important place, because it is growing as a 
trade partner. Latin America is the region where U.S. exports 
are increasing faster, nearly 18 percent per year, while in 
other areas they are paralyzed or decreasing. We must add to 
that the fact that principles supported by the U.S. 
Administration, such as democracy, the market economy, and the 
peaceful solution of conflicts, are becoming stronger here. 
  The U.S. people are very sparing in their praise. This is 
why if they say that the Argentine transition process is taking 
place very quickly, and that its results are spectacular, it is 
because they believe this to be the case. Our bilateral 
relations are also improving as a result of the fundamental 
objectives shared by the two countries: respect for democratic 
institutions, environmental protection, defense of human rights, 
and the peace and security concept defended by the United 
Nations. 
  [Crivelli] For decades Brazil played the role of a 
preferential U.S. partner in this region, but recently a 
deterioration has been noticed in Brasilia-Washington ties. 
Could Argentina take the place left vacant by the Brazilians? 
  [Granillo Ocampo] It definitely already is taking it. 
  [Crivelli] You have traveled with U.S. Vice President Al 
Gore. Before his arrival in our country there was information 
that his agenda included, among other issues, corruption and 
drug trafficking. Were the problems encountered by U.S. 
companies in participating in the privatizations discussed? 
  [Granillo Ocampo] It would be appropriate to make clear that 
there was a real agenda -- following talks between the two sides 
-- and another agenda concocted by the press on the basis of 
isolated reports. The issues of corruption, drug trafficking, 
or independent courts were never included in the real agenda. 
These issues were also not discussed during the two visits that 
Gore paid to President Menem. It is true that there are some 
companies that complain about problems in entering our country 
over what we may describe as the practice of corruption, but 
this does not seem to be the rule. During the past two years 
almost all the privatizations have been awarded to U.S. 
companies. If they were not successful bidders during the first 
two years it was because they did not participate. During that 
period, they actually did not believe in the privatization 
process. 
  [Crivelli] There is one inevitable issue, either on the real 
agenda or on that of the newspapers: the patents law. Does it 
have a deadline? Is it 30 April? What is the situation right 
now? 
  [Granillo Ocampo] From the correct perspective, the issue is 
like this: We made an international commitment, the GATT 
agreement, and therefore we must at least promulgate a law. In 
addition to that, there is a commitment marked by our interest 
in joining NAFTA. If we want to harmonize our policy with the 
United States in that field, it is necessary to accept some 
rules. It is not a question of giving in to a big stick policy. 
  The members of NAFTA -- Mexico, Canada, and the United 
States 
-- have defined a minimum level for the patents law, and this is 
what is being negotiated. What would be best for us, reject 
NAFTA and not have a patents law, or have a patents law with 
some limitations and join NAFTA? President Carlos Menem decided 
for the second option. There is a 1 May deadline to prepare a 
report on the countries with which there is an interest in 
starting negotiations. Based on that report the president will 
submit his final proposal to Congress on 1 July indicating the 
countries with which it is suggested that negotiations be 
started. 
  [Crivelli] Will Senate approval be enough to avoid a 
conflict, or will it be necessary to have the approval of both 
chambers? 
  [Granillo Ocampo] I don't believe it will be necessary to 
have the approval of both chambers. They know it involves 
different powers, and what must be shown is progress in the 
right direction. 
  [Crivelli] The Whitewater affair affecting President Clinton 
had wide press coverage in Argentina. What is its real impact 
on the American people? 
  [Granillo Ocampo] This affair is obviously overblown. The 
latest U.S. poll shows that 16 percent of the American people 
believe the president could have done something wrong, and 84 
percent believe he did not. Also, there is nothing against 
Clinton. No accusation against him has been made, and he is not 
under investigation. The accusations published by the press are 
only possibilities, and have been greatly exaggerated. 
  [Crivelli] What is the objective of the summit of presidents 
to be held in December in Miami? 
  [Granillo Ocampo] The objective is to prepare a work agenda 
for the region, including issues that interest President Clinton 
and the Latin American presidents. In other words, the 
definition of regional policies is a multilateral issue; it will 
emerge from the talks among all parties involved. The idea is 
also to emphasize the importance of Latin America for the 
Democratic administration. The meeting could also be 
interpreted as an equivalent to the Americas Initiative of the 
Republican administration. Argentina is an important spokesman 
for the region. We have been previously consulted, and helped 
create the idea, the agenda, and the site for the summit.

<F P=106> [Article by Roman Lejtman] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Vice President Al Gore's blitz visit helped to 
confirm that Alberto Lestelle [programming and coordination 
secretary for the prevention of drug abuse and the antinarcotics 
struggle], Hugo Anzorreguy [National Intelligence Center, CNI, 
secretary], and [Interior Minister] Carlos Ruckauf will be 
traveling to Washington to meet with Robert Gelbard, U.S. 
assistant secretary of state for international narcotics 
matters. The Argentine officials will assist the Bill Clinton 
administration in drafting the agenda for the so-called Summit 
of the Americas, to be held in Miami at the end of this year, 
which is to be attended by the presidents of the Americas to 
discuss issues pertaining to narcotrafficking, corruption, and 
terrorism, among others. The Argentine proposal, which is still 
being drafted, suggests an overall modification of penal 
regulations to prevent drug cartels from continuing to take 
advantage of legal gaps. 
  According to a communique issued last night by Lestelle's 
office, "at the suggestion of President Menem the antinarcotics 
struggle will be included on the agenda of the Summit of the 
Americas." 
  Menem wants to arrive in Miami with his homework done. He 
will therefore be launching an offensive at the legislative 
level to promulgate a series of laws based on measures that have 
been suggested by the United States. Menem believes that for 
the time being, no new scandals involving the government with 
ill begotten money will break up. In view of this he has 
decided to take advantage of this situation to push for passage 
four laws that he personally put on hold when the scandals broke 
involving the suitcases belonging to [Menem's sister-in-law] 
Amira [Yoma] and Monzer Al Kassar's citizenship. 
  During his visit to Mar del Plata, where he attended the 
ordinary meeting of the Inter-American Commission for the 
Control of Drug Abuse (CICAD), Gelbard gave his blessings to the 
four draft bills that Lestelle uncovered when he learned that 
Amira would be acquitted before the end of 1994. Three years 
after learning about Yoma's bizarre activities, Lestelle is 
supporting the following initiatives: 
  -- Repentant: It authorizes magistrates to reduce the 
sentences of those drug traffickers who agree to cooperate with 
the courts. The implementation of this legal figure resulted in 
the dismantling of the gang to which Amira Yoma reportedly 
belonged. The government is not worried about Mario Caserta, 
the only one arrested under the Narcogate deal, because it is 
expected that Menem's former friend will be released before the 
approval of the repentant law. 
  -- Informer: It lifts the penalty of those involved who 
supply information on the operations of drug cartels. It is one 
grade lower than repentant. 
  -- Undercover Agent: It allows security force members to 
infiltrate drug cartels under the control of the courts. 
  -- Cargoes Under Court Surveillance: It authorizes the 
continuation of drug operations to detain those responsible in 
the country where the drug is received. 
  Referring to the issues he discussed with Gore during an 
impromptu news conference, Menem said: "We discussed the 
scourges of narcotrafficking and terrorism, and the urgent need 
to undertake joint efforts to combat them." The president did 
not explain to the journalists what these "joint efforts" would 
be, but he did give an indication of the U.S. Government's 
aspirations, which go beyond the bills the Argentine Government 
has promised to promote in Congress. 
  -- "Is there any possibility that the Armed Forces would 
participate in the counternarcotics struggle?" a journalist 
asked. 
  -- "Not for the time being," answered Menem. 
  -- "Why for the time being?" 
  -- "Because that is the way it is: Not for the time 
being. A politician cannot make predictions. A politician 
talks about facts. I am talking about a fact: Not for the time 
being."

  [Text] The United States is only aggravating the tense 
situation on the Korean peninsula in ordering today the 
deployment of 36 Patriot missile batteries and in insisting on 
the Team Spirit maneuvers. 
  Washington is also fostering UN sanctions against North 
Korea. The aim of all these efforts is to force Pyongyang to 
allow an inspection of its nuclear program installations. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency inspected all but two 
of those nuclear installations between 1 and 5 March. Now in its 
report it is trying to force the opening of the plants not 
visited to verification, although the North Korean Government 
has rejected the U.S. military threats as being harmful to its 
national sovereignty. 
  President William Clinton is sponsoring punitive measures 
against North Korea through the UN Security Council such as by 
cutting financial, grain, or fuel supplies. Meanwhile, military 
pressure against Pyongyang continues.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] During the period between January and November of 
last year, the country's trade balance showed a deficit of 
$1.4906 billion, according to the figures published by the 
Central Bank. 
  In the most recent issue of the bulletin PRINCIPALES 
INDICADORES ECONOMICOS published by that institution, Dominican 
exports came to $501.1 million during that period, while 
cumulative imports came to $1.9917 billion. 
  The absolute lowest export figure in the course of the last 
five years was seen in 1992, when goods worth $566.1 million 
were exported, according to other bank publications. 
  If the monthly average accumulated for exports in the year 
just past is maintained, we will break the record for the lowest 
export total since 1988. 
  The figure of $501.1 million quoted for cumulative exports 
last November included $151.1 million for sugar and sugar 
products, $23.9 million for coffee and processed coffee 
products, $34.6 million for cacao and its processed products; 
$29.3 million for tobacco and its processed products, $119.1 
million for minerals, and $143.1 million for other products, the 
bulletin indicated. 
  One of the components that showed the greatest decline was 
the mineral category, which includes ferronickel, gilt, gold, 
and silver. The total declined from $160.8 million in the 
comparable period in 1992 to $119.1 million in 1993. 
  The Dominican economic products traditionally exported are 
sugar and its derivatives, coffee, cacao, tobacco, and minerals. 
They have accounted for more than 90 percent of the export 
totals. The rest of the goods exported are principally 
nontraditional products. 
  In recent years, nontraditional products have gained in 
importance. 
  The "Other Products" category, made up basically of 
nontraditional products, showed a cumulative export total of 
$143.1 million pesos. This figure covers 11 months of last year, 
and it exceeded the total for the exports in this category made 
throughout the whole of 1992--$139.5 million, according to the 
Central Bank publication. 
  Various business organizations have been issuing public 
warnings about the increasing deficit in the Dominican trade 
balance and its consequences. 
  In the view of many economists, the gradual decline in goods 
has been offset by the export of services, in the tourism and 
free zone sectors in particular. 
  There are various interpretations of the exports from the 
free zones. Some are based on the figures provided by the U.S. 
Department of Commerce, while others take the figures provided 
by the Dominican Government as the point of departure.. 
  The foreign-exchange income of the Central Bank obtained as 
a 
result of free-zone operations came to $5.9 million pesos in the 
period between January and June, according to the figures shown 
in the foreign-exchange balance table published in the quarterly 
bulletin of the banking institution. 
  That publication carried the figures on the gross domestic 
product (GDP) up to the month of September 1993. 
  They show growth of 1.5 percent, at constant 1970 prices, 
including the mining sector. 
  It is notable that this publication carried a calculation of 
the additional product without including the mining sector, 
since viewed separately, that showed a decline of 42.1 percent, 
the publication indicated. 
  In answer to questions posed by our editor recently, the 
governor of the Central Bank estimated that the GDP might show 
an increase of 3-4 percent. However, this official noted, by way 
of reservation, that the final figures have not yet been made 
available. 
  The commitment made by the Dominican Republic to the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the year just past was to 
achieve product growth of about five percent. 
  Certain foundations that make estimates in this connection 
predicted that growth would come to less than 1 percent. 
  The foreign-exchange balance came to $643.4 million pesos in 
gross reserves in the January-November period, down from the 
figure reported in the month of August, which was $714.2 million 
pesos. 
  The document in question revealed that the foreign income 
included in this balance actually obtained from the export of 
goods came to $300.5 million pesos, the lowest figure in recent 
years. 
  However, the figure for the service category (which includes 
tourism) was $630 million pesos. 
  The sector in service exports that is most effectively 
integrated in the economy is tourism. However, it accounted 
directly for the generation of only 40,000 jobs throughout the 
country. On the contrary, the declining goods-export sector 
directly generated more than 200,000 jobs, thus revealing the 
level of its integration into the economy. 
  An economy that has an unemployment rate of 28 percent, with 
more than 600,000 idle workers, requires economic activities 
that generate as many jobs as possible, the development 
theoreticians say. 
  Currency issues as of the end of last November showed a 
balance of 13.5088 billion pesos, exceeding the currency issues 
for the comparable period in 1992 by 31 percent, this 
publication reported. 
  The inflation reported for the period between November of 
1992 and November of 1993 was 2.54 percent, with each month 
being compared with its counterpart of the preceding year. 
  In this instance, no proportionality between the one and the 
other can be seen as one of the factors explaining the expansion 
of currency issues. 
  This is an indication that the increase of 31 percent during 
a 12-month period, when inflation was only 2.54 percent, was due 
to other reasons. 
  The expanded supply of currency came to a total of 31.3574 
billion pesos, revealing an increase of 24 percent in the period 
of 12 months between November of 1992 to November of 1993. 
  The bulletin also shows that savings and term deposits came 
to 17.010 billion pesos, with a large part of the currency 
issued remaining in the vaults of the commercial banks, in their 
current accounts in the Central Bank, and in the cash reserve 
funds of that bank. 
  The potential inflationary effect of an increase of 31 
percent in currency issues in 12 months was totally canceled out 
by the liquidity reserves of the banks and the cash funds.

  [Text] Our companion Elizabeth Diaz Otero has reported the 
following: Luis Donaldo Colosio sustained a bullet wound in the 
head, near the right temple and two bullets in the abdomen, not 
one, but two. The Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] 
presidential candidate sustained three bullet wounds. He is 
undergoing surgery. He has lost a lot of blood, which has been 
replenished by the doctors of Central Hospital in the city of 
Tijuana, Baja California. Luis Donaldo Colosio is being 
transferred at this moment to the (?Schlips) Clinic in La Joya, 
California, where he will be treated by doctors who 
approximately 45 minutes ago were alerted to receive Mr. Colosio 
in order to give him proper treatment. 
  Regarding the attackers, two persons are under arrest. One 
is between 20 and 25 years of age. The young man has curly 
hair. He was arrested by the PRI presidential candidate's 
security agents. The group is headed by General Ramiro Garcia 
Reyes. They were arrested by agents of the Judicial Federal 
Police [PFJ] garrison in Tijuana. Neither the motives are 
known, nor the names of the perpetrators. Witnesses to the 
incident said that as of 1905 [time as heard] veritable chaos 
has prevailed in the city of Tijuana. We are awaiting more 
information regarding this attack.

<F P=106> ["The Key Facts of the Elections" -- EL TIEMPO headline] </F>
  [Text] After analyzing the results of the 13 March 
elections, the following data appears to be most relevant: 
  Absenteeism prevailed. On this occasion it reached the 
alarming figure of 70 percent. 
  There was a strong surge of independent movements, 
especially 
the Christians, thanks to a lack of unity and discipline among 
the traditional parties. 
  The 19 April Movement-Democratic Alliance [AD M-19], which 
was the "star" [vedette] of the 1991 elections, was the big 
loser, because it was left with no seats in Congress. 
  These are some of the most interesting aspects of the 
parliamentary elections after analyzing all the data. 
  EL TIEMPO presents a summary of the most interesting points 
of the 13 March elections. The parliamentary map could suffer 
slight changes next week as soon as the general vote count 
concludes. 
<H5>  Apathy </H5>
  The country had not registered such abstention levels in the 
past 15 years. 
  Little more than 5 million out of 17 million Colombians 
qualified to vote actually voted. 
  The negligent attitude shown by the voters contributed, to a 
great extent, to the generalized debacle of dozens of 
candidates, many of whom have ample experience. 
  Paired with this trend, "political bosses" lost weight and 
electoral density. 
  Galanism suffered a collapse. Its Senate representation is 
limited to the seat of Narino leader Parmenio Cuellar. 
  Veteran leaders of this political force, such as Rafael 
Amador, Maria Cristina Ocampo, Mauricio Guzman, and Arturo 
Sarabia Better, were left out. 
  Liberalism also lost important figures in Congress such as 
Orlando Vasquez Velasquez and failed to have elected new and 
outstanding persons such as Juan Lozano, former private 
secretary of Luis Carlos Galan. 
  One of the highest abstention rates was registered in Santa 
Fe de Bogota -- 75 percent. The capital city district elected 
representatives with only 8,000 votes. 
<H5>  Strength of the Minorities </H5>
  In contrast to the collapse of the AD M-19, which until 
prior 
to the elections was defined as the first great minority, the 
Christian movement registered a surprising rise. 
  The Christian Movement, C-4 [expansion unknown], Lay 
Movement 
for Colombia, and National Christian Party secured three 
senators with heavy voting. They are currently disputing a 
fourth seat. It will all depend on the result of the recount of 
votes garnered by Ponco Renteria and Claudia Rodriguez de 
Castellano. 
  We must stress that women have progressively won greater 
participation in the Legislative Branch. They won the seats for 
six senators and 18 representatives. They only had one senator 
in the dissolved 1990 Congress. 
  Santa Fe de Bogota registered the highest female 
representation. Six women were elected to the 18 seats at the 
Chamber of Representatives. 
  It is also interesting to note what happened at the 
coffee-producing axis [eje cafetero], Caldas, Quindio, and 
Risaralda, where three women were elected to the 11 seats at the 
Chamber of Representatives. 
  In contrast, Antioquia Department elected no woman. 
<H5>  Classic Majorities </H5>
  The Liberal Party consolidated its majority at the Senate 
and 
garnered 1,731,753 votes. The Conservative Party, including all 
its currents, garnered 759,057 votes. 
  Liberalism expanded its representation at the Senate. It won 
57 seats in 1991 and 59 in this election. 
  Theoretically speaking, Conservatism increased from 22 to 31 
senators. This figure includes those elected from the New 
Democratic Force, which also has leaders of Liberal origin and 
the National Salvation Movement. 
<H5>  Leftist Downfall </H5>
  Other movements that originated from the peace agreements, 
along with the AD M-19, which certain analysts define as the 
center left, were among the casualties. 
  The Patriotic Union (UP) and Hope, Peace, and Liberty (EPL) 
lost representation in the Chamber of Representatives. For 
example, they lost all representatives in Antioquia Department. 
The same was true in Arauca. 
  Nevertheless, the Communist Party managed to have Manuel 
Cepeda Vargas elected senator with heavy voting. 
  The MOIR [Independent Workers Revolutionary Movement] also 
managed to have Jorge Santos elected to the higher chamber.

  [Text] Federal Supreme Court [STF] Chairman Luiz Octavio 
Gallotti has released two notes to the media about the 
self-authorized wage increases for the Judicial Branch. 
  In one note the STF answers criticisms that followed the 
wage 
increase. The other note states that he is surprised at the 
government argument that it does not have funds to pay the 
increase because the funds requested for the increase are 
already deposited in the Bank of Brazil. 
  STF Chairman Gallotti yesterday released two notes to the 
media. One note rebuffs criticisms of the Judicial Branch, and 
the other states that the Judicial Branch payroll is being 
processed normally. 
  The STF chairman states that he does not understand the 
government allegation that there are not enough funds for the 
increase because the funds were deposited on 18 March in the STF 
account in the Bank of Brazil. Gallotti said the deposit of 
funds is compatible with the administrative decision by the STF 
justices on 10 March. 
  According to figures released by the STF, the deposit of 
1.75 
million URV's was more than was requested. The STF president 
said the justices have correctly implemented the provisional 
measure creating the URV, respecting the Constitution. 
  Gallotti did not want to comment on a possible revision of 
the provisional measure or on the salary cuts as announced by 
the government. The STF chairman says he does not make 
decisions on his own and the STF will make a statement only when 
it receives an official communique from the government. 
  Regarding criticism of the Judicial Branch, the STF 
president 
acknowledges the right to disagree but he says the criticisms 
were made without moderation. He added that if there is 
disagreement among the government branches, he will not 
encourage it. 
  Meanwhile, President Itamar Franco met with Finance Minister 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso and confirmed that the government will 
not pay the wage increase for the Judicial Branch. The 
president has ordered the Bank of Brazil to discount the wage 
increase deposited for judicial and legislative branch payrolls. 
  President Itamar Franco again guaranteed yesterday that the 
wage increase authorized by the STF is illegal and that the 
government will not pay anything that goes against the law. 
After meeting in Planalto Palace with the finance minister he 
authorized the release of an internal Finance Ministry provision 
ordering the Bank of Brazil to discount the 10.9-percent wage 
increase from the payroll of the Judicial and Legislative 
Branches. 
  [Begin Franco recording] I said and reassert: The government 
will not pay anything outsid the law. We consider the STF is 
not complying with the law established by the provisional 
measure. Therefore we will only authorize the funds we think the 
STF should receive. [end recording]

  [Text] The Brazilian military commanders made it understood 
to President Itamar Franco that they are willing to support him 
in an hypothetical "self coup" given the serious institutional 
crisis that exists between the government, the Federal Supreme 
Court [STF], and Congress. 
  The newspaper O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO today reported that in 
the face of the indignation caused by the salary privileges the 
STF granted to itself and a similar attempt by members of 
Congress, the eight military ministers suggested President 
Franco carry out a coup. 
  During a meeting held five days ago with Franco in Planalto 
Palace, the commanders found President Franco "receptive" to 
their criticisms and demands to approve a salary equity law for 
the three government branches. 
  Following the meeting, which was attended by some civilian 
ministers, President Itamar Franco officially expressed his 
discontent with the decision made by the STF and Congress, and 
he then refused to grant them the wage increase, calculated to 
be 10.9 percent and possibly amounting to more than $1.25 
billion, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso said today. 
  When EFE asked a Government House spokesman about the "self 
coup" idea, he answered: "No comment." 
  The military chiefs sent their message in different ways. 
The 
newspaper states that Strategic Affairs Secretary Admiral Cesar 
Flores made the strongest proposals like closing down Congress, 
the replacement of the STF justices, and earlier elections -- 
except for president. 
  As a result of this crisis, President Franco, a 63-year-old 
civil engineer, has come out stronger in his position and, 
according to O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO, he has become a chief of 
state "under military tutelage with a discredited Congress and a 
Judicial Branch that insists on not bending." 
  Franco said the STF decision "is outside the law," which 
brought him applause from the Armed Forces, opposition leader 
and presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula Da Silva, several 
governors, and the public in general. 
  Franco, whose popularity has dropped constantly, was 
supported by 85 percent of the people surveyed by the Instituto 
Soma polling company. 
  "Franco has proceeded correctly. I do not know if he has 
followed military instructions but the Judicial Branch has 
committed a shameful action instead of creating justice," said 
Da Silva, who is the favorite candidate for the 3 October 
elections according to polls. 
  The STF justices and Judicial Branch employees today 
received 
their salaries without the 10.9-percent increase implemented to 
compensate for an alleged salary loss as a result of the salary 
conversion into the Real Value Unit (URV) based on the dollar 
exchange rate and the plan implemented to curb inflation, which 
amounts to 40 percent per month. 
  With the purpose of appeasing the spirits, the Senate has 
rejected a decision by the Chamber of Deputies to follow the 
STF's example and increase the salaries of members of Congress 
and Legislative Branch employees by 23.5 percent. 
  The STF's discredit before the public and which Congress has 
been suffering for several months has encouraged several 
military chiefs to bring up the constitutional precept that 
allows the president to declare a state of national defense and 
they recalled the atmosphere preceding the 1964 military coup. 
  "The troops are not indifferent to the people's demands. 
Thirty years ago we attended to a demand by the people for 
ideological reasons, and now it may be for reasons of 
`privileges' [the Judicial and Legislative Branches' salaries]," 
said Federal Police chief and retired Army Colonel Wilson Romao. 
  Navy Minister Ivan Serpa criticized the justices and members 
of Congress, but he also rejected any eventual coup attempt by 
military units. "If I find someone defending that position I 
will either arrest or discharge him," Serpa said.

  [Text] Brasilia, 23 Mar (EFE) -- Brazilian Congress 
President Humberto Lucena, a centrist, today ruled out a 
possible declaration of a state of national defense, restricting 
constitutional guarantees, over a confrontation pitting the 
Executive Branch and the Armed Forces against the Legislative 
Branch and the Federal Supreme Court [STF]. 
  Lucena indicated that the rumors that circulated today in 
the 
federal legislative chambers have been prompted "by the creative 
imagination of pessimists." In his opinion, the institutional 
crisis must be overcome without altering the independence and 
harmony among the three branches of government. 
  Official sources reported that at Planalto Palace, the 
government's seat, Brazilian President Itamar Franco discussed 
the political situation today with conservative Deputy Inocencio 
de Oliveira, the Chamber of Deputies president, and the official 
spokesmen in Congress. 
  Judicial Branch sources said Attorney General Aristides 
Junqueira has become a mediator between the government and the 
STF and has studied a formula with Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso to overcome the crisis. 
  Junqueira expressed his disagreement with the fact that a 
controversy on salaries and salary equity among the three 
branches of government had jeopardized institutional stability. 
  The STF decided on a 10.9-percent salary increase for court 
justices and employees with the goal of compensating for 
possible losses in the conversion of real cruzeiros into the 
Real Value Unit (URV) system, using dollars and the future 
Brazilian currency as a reference. 
  Franco and his finance minister denied the increase's 
payment 
to the STF because they believe it violates the presidential 
decree implementing the URV system. 
  In light of the unilateral approval of the increases for the 
STF and Congress, which today preferred to abolish a similar 
increase, military leaders have taken the dust off a 
constitutional provision authorizing the president to declare a 
state of national defense. 
  According to various newspapers, after implementing this 
measure, the government and the Armed Forces would move up the 
congressional elections, scheduled for 3 October, even though 
Franco would complete his term that ends on 1 January 1995. 
  Franco's strong position toward the STF is supported by the 
Armed Forces, which often complain about their low salaries, and 
the public. 
  With the declaration of a state of national defense, the 
right to assembly, secrecy of the postal service and 
communications, occupation of public property, and services are 
restricted and people may be arrested without a court order, 
even though their arrest must be immediately reported to a judge. 
  Although it goes into effect with the president's signature, 
a state of defense must be confirmed within a 10-day period by 
Congress and, if rejected, it expires immediately. 
  If a state of defense is confirmed by Congress, it will be 
effective for one month and may be extended for another month.

  [Text] The finance minister said taxes will have to be 
increased to pay for the salary readjustment for members of the 
Legislative and Judicial Branches. Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso said he cannot accept converting salaries into 
Real Value Units on the 25th of each month, as the Federal 
Supreme Court wants. If the conversion is done on that day, the 
government will have losses totalling $1.25 billion. According 
to the finance minister, the government will have to create more 
taxes to cover these losses: 
  [Begin recording] I am giving them the results. If they want 
to change the conversion date to the 25th, they will have to 
collect taxes equivalent to $1.25 billion. It will be very clear 
in the eyes of the people that everyone is paying for this 
salary increase. Calculations, however, will have to be made. It 
will not be 5 percent over a small portion, because the minister 
will not agree to that. This readjustment cannot be granted only 
to a small sector and not to everyone. The federal 
administration minister does not agree to that, the president of 
the Republic does not agree to that, and I do not either. The 
famous discussion about the Treasury, the budget, and about 
these valuable people who work hard... [pauses] Some people are 
even saying that I am adopting two different concepts, but I am 
not. [Word indistinct] and they are right. The administration 
minister comes to me and says: If we agree to increase their 
salaries, we must increase everyone's salaries. What do you 
think of that? Therefore, we cannot increase anyone's salary. It 
is the same thing. Unless we adopt a new procedure in Brazil and 
begin saying things clearly and openly, nothing will work out. 
If we agree to change the date from the 30th to the 25th, we 
will have to do it for everyone. If we do it for everyone, 
someone will have to get me the $1.25 billion. [end recording] 
  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso also commented on the 
possibility of running in the presidential elections. He is 
analyzing whether it is really the time to leave the government, 
particularly now that there is such confusion among the three 
government branches.

  [Text] The Senate voted against increasing deputies' 
salaries. Meeting the request of Chamber of Deputies President 
Inocencio Oliveira and other leaders, the federal Senate buried 
the deputies' dream of increasing their salaries: 54 senators 
voted yes, two voted no, and four abstained from voting on the 
decision to maintain President Itamar Franco's veto of plans to 
make congressmen's salaries equal to the highest ones paid to 
Federal Supreme Court members. 
  Based on the Constitution, Deputy Paulo Delgado (Workers 
Party) requested that the 16 March session be annulled. During 
this session, the congressmen voted against three other vetoes 
of salary increases for public employees working for state-owned 
companies and other official organizations and the government 
decision to establish ministers of state's salaries as the 
ceiling for all public employees' salaries. Delgado made a 
motion to the Chamber of Deputies Constitution and Justice 
Committee calling for annulment of the session and was supported 
by Chamber of Deputies President Oliveira. 
  [Begin recording] [Delgado] We deem [words indistinct] 
ceiling the fastest possible to be able to take the issue to a 
plenary session and thus annul that day's voting on these vetoes. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Therefore, there will be no 
immediate 
salary increase. 
  [Delgado] None at all. I believe this is an extremely 
difficult moment in which the country is calling for austerity 
in all sectors of society and we must set an example. [end 
recording] 
  If the Constitution and Justice Committee decides to annul 
the latest congressional session, a plenary session will still 
have to be held but at least the possibility of increasing the 
salaries of deputies and senators by 23.5 percent has been 
entirely dismissed. 
  In a live report from Congress, reporter Alessandra Anselmo 
has more news: 
  [Begin relay] Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio 
Oliveira, who also attended the Planalto Palace meeting seeking 
to solve the crisis among the three government branches, 
reported that regarding the vetoes of salary equalization -- 
which were voted against by Congress -- it has been decided that 
the government will send Congress another draft bill 
establishing the ceiling for public employees' salaries at 90 
percent of the salary of a minister of state. Thus, the problem 
caused by the presidential veto of the high salaries paid by 
state-owned companies, which had been voted against by the 
national Congress, has been solved. [end relay]

  [Text] Here is a report on the national day of protest 
against possible salary deterioration caused by the economic 
plan. The strike called by the labor centrals ended up as a set 
of sporadic demonstrations. 
  The Sao Paulo subway began operating this morning at 0700, 
two hours later than normal. A demonstration by bus drivers and 
ticket collectors caused a traffic jam on Celso Garcia Avenue, 
one of the most important avenues in eastern Sao Paulo. 
  In downtown Sao Paulo, retired bank employees protested 
ironically, asking for donations for the deputies who increased 
their own salaries. 
  Sao Paulo industrial belt metalworkers blocked the Anchieta 
highway, which joins Sao Paulo and the sea coast, in protest 
against the Volkswagen truck factory. 
  In the afternoon, bank employees, chemical industry workers, 
and taxi drivers staged a motorade along Paulista Avenue. 
  In Brasilia, public servants march along the ministries' 
esplanade. The police guard was reinforced. The march ended 
with a demonstration in front of the Finance Ministry building.

  [Text] Supreme Federal Court President Otavio Galotti 
criticized what he called improper government meddling in 
Judicial Branch accounts. 
  When Supreme Court justices arrived for today's plenary 
session, they declined to talk about salaries. But before the 
session they held a meeting under the protection of guards. This 
delayed the beginning of the session for almost an hour. 
  During the session, Galotti again read a note released on 21 
March saying the Supreme Court rejects the crude and 
unacceptable insults against the court and its members. 
  Galotti once again explained that salaries were converted to 
the URV [Real Value Unit] on 20 March because judicial branch 
members are paid their salaries on the 20th of each month. 
According to him, this measure caused no salary increase and 
served only to prevent losses from the conversion. 
  Galotti harshly criticized the government decision to cancel 
the 10.9 percent adjustment of the salaries paid today. 
  Attorney General Aristides Junqueira, who is attending the 
Supreme Court meetings, said after the session that the 
conversion is a 10-percent problem that is jeopardizing 
Brazilian institutions, and that this is unbelievable. 
  Junqueira added that the solution is to modify the law and, 
to this end, representatives of the three branches of government 
are negotiating.

  [Text] The Senate released a communique on 22 March 
charging that the government is using the media to foment the 
crisis among the three branches of government, a crisis prompted 
by the conversion of salaries into the URV [Real Value Unit] 
system on 20 March. According to the communique, the state of 
democratic law does not allow a confrontation among the branches 
of the Republic "under penalty of an institutional crisis of 
serious internal and external consequences." 
  In the following paragraph, the Senate notes that it is 
appropriate for the press to criticize or praise the actions of 
the three branches of government and correct possible mistakes. 
The communique says: "It is not correct, however, to use the 
media to foment animosities that may compromise the 
institutions." 
  The communique also recalls that Congress did not fail to 
support the government, and approved the economic program. The 
communique, signed by Congress President Senator Humberto Lucena 
(PMDB-PB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Paraiba State]), 
notes that nothing will justify a diversion from championing the 
"system of responsible rights, our country's supreme legal and 
social good, rights that are actually based on respect for 
independence and harmony among the three branches of 
government." The communique concludes with a call for common 
sense to prevail, with negotiations by the president of the 
Republic, "who, under a presidential system of government, is 
entitled to conduct our country's political-administrative 
process."

<F P=106> [Article by Sandra Brasil and Silvia Faria] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- In the military commanders' opinion, 
the impasse among the three branches of government will only be 
politically overcome if the Federal Supreme Court (STF) retracts 
its decision to increase the URV [Real Value Unit]-adjusted 
salaries or if their members ask for their removal, involving 
resignation or retirement. Unyielding in their expectations of 
abolishment of the salary increases, the military leaders 
already have, among various alternatives for the possible 
outcome of the current crisis, a declaration of a state of 
national defense as a strategy to move up the call for general 
elections. 
  A general who has free access within the Armed Forces and 
Planalto Palace told O GLOBO on 22 March: "As (Army) Minister 
Zenildo de Lucena has told President Itamar Franco, it is a 
moral problem. The Army cannot retreat." 
  The military leaders already have proposals for 
constitutional alternatives that they would raise after the 
declaration of a state of defense, moving up the elections. 
They are betting on Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso's advantage since he would attract all anti-Lula (PT -- 
Workers Party --presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da 
Silva) forces. The alternatives and their possible outcome will 
be discussed during an Army High Command meeting scheduled for 
24 and 25 March in the Brasilia headquarters. 
  A military minister said: "The military has the 
constitutional duty of guaranteeing order and harmony among the 
branches of government. This harmony has been broken with a 
decision made by the Judicial and Legislative Branches to grant 
themselves salary increases." 
  According to the assessment made by the military commanders, 
there is no possible solution to the impasse among the branches 
of government without producing trauma for the administration. 
The military commanders do not consider the possibility that 
the STF might retract and abolish the 10.9-percent increase 
granted to the Judicial Branch because this "would involve 
pleading guilty." The military commanders caution that even if 
Franco eventually decides to make the Executive Branch's 
position more flexible, a retreat would not be possible because 
it would demoralize the president of the Republic. 
  The minister noted: "The president has taken an irrevocable 
stance. If he retreats, it would weaken the government." 
  The president's irrevocable stance, expressed in a note 
released after a tense ministerial meeting on 18 March, was 
challenged by some of the ministers present at the meeting. In 
the opinion of these ministers, the note should leave some room 
for possible negotiation with the STF. It was Franco himself, 
encouraged by the military leaders' indignation over the salary 
increases for the Legislative and Judicial Branches, who decided 
on the communique's radical overtones. 
  The source said: "He also could not run the risk of calling 
for negotiations and being defeated." 
  Among the options reviewed by the military leaders, there 
was 
the possibility of appealing to the STF itself for its decision 
because the salary increase was granted at the administrative 
level. The military leaders, however, thought there was a risk 
of the Executive Branch being defeated since the action's 
judgment would be passed by the same (STF) justices who 
unanimously approved the salary increase. 
  Another military adviser said: "The judges are making an 
attempt to transform the criticism of the decision that they 
made into criticism of the supreme institution. It is like 
attempting to involve the Armed Forces in criticism of a 
decision eventually made by the military ministers." 
  The military leaders believe they have society's support for 
an eventual intervention if there is no political solution to 
the impasse. And, from any angle, the solution depends on the 
STF's retreat alone. Concerning the Legislative Branch, the 
military ministers' expectations are that the decision to 
increase the salaries will be abolished. 
  The general noted: "The military never anticipates what 
society wants. Those who dared to do this failed." 
  With much caution, the possibility of an intervention is 
under discussion in the barracks. It is not compared, however, 
with the 1964 military coup that deposed President Joao Goulart 
and installed an ad hoc government in our country. The 
intervention currently under review would reportedly be aimed at 
restoring harmony among the branches of government. In the 
military leaders' interpretation, this represents removing the 
salary increases for the Judicial and Legislative Branches. 
  A late attempt at negotiating with the Executive Branch was 
unsuccessfully made on the afternoon of 21 March when Edson 
Vidigal, a Superior Court of Justice (STJ) justice (appointed by 
former President Jose Sarney), played the role of a Judicial 
Branch envoy to convince the Executive Branch of the lawfulness 
of the STF's decision. 
  A military source explained: "This mission might have 
succeeded in initiating negotiations if it had been carried out 
last week before the government's and the STF's radicalization. 
Now it is too late." 
  The military ministers still are expecting an unmistakable 
position by Minister Fernando Henrique, whom they guaranteed 
their support for the economic program's approval. 
  A usual Army interlocutor claimed: "The minister spent five 
days out of town and still has not taken a clear position." 
  Among the Armed Forces, the Navy is the most indignant over 
the decisions made by the Legislative and Judicial Branches. 
Despite being more cautious, the Army is no less indignant. 
Minister Zenildo de Lucena often has guaranteed that the 
democratic system is not in jeopardy and that any solution will 
be determined by the Constitution.

<F P=106> [Article by Joao Bosco Rabello: "The Ghost of the Coup"] </F>
  [Text] An irreversible feature of the crisis caused by the 
salary issue is the return of the military to the political 
fore, and with popular support. An 18 March meeting at Planalto 
Palace was the most sensitive moment on the fragile path of 
return to democracy, which began when a civilian movement 
elected Tancredo Neves. The military leadership's reaction to 
the Judicial Branch and Congress found that Itamar Franco was 
absolutely willing to play the role of Juan Bordaberry (a former 
Uruguayan president who in 1973 agreed to military tutelage and 
was finally ousted in 1976). The military reaction also found 
that there are no leaders capable of putting out the fire. From 
now on, government decisions will need military endorsement. 
  The political interpretation that is being made -- though in 
a restrained, discreet manner -- is that since 18 March, the 
independence of the branches of government has been put to the 
test, and that a sudden expression of military support has 
transformed an unconcerned president into a strong chief of 
state. Consequently, from a formal viewpoint, there is a 
president under military tutelage, a Congress with impaired 
morale, and a judicial branch that is resisting in order to 
avoid kneeling down. 
  The 18 March meeting was dramatic. Civilian ministers with a 
seat in Congress were excluded under the pretext of suspicion: 
The agenda included salaries and, therefore, it was a matter of 
personal, direct interest to Congress (as if the matter were not 
also of personal interest to the military). Civilian Household 
Chief Henrique Hargreaves and General Secretary Mauro Durante 
began the meeting. The others, only four, arrived later, after 
pressing calls. 
  The military chiefs gave their message in various forms. 
Admiral Mario Flores (head of the Strategic Affairs Secretariat 
-- SAE) outlined the more radical proposals, like closing 
Congress, replacing STF [Supreme Federal Court] judges, and 
calling for general elections (not for president). Flores 
mentioned these proposals as information. If the president had 
been receptive to these ideas, they would have turned into a 
formal proposal; if not, they were reports conveyed by the 
appropriate official. 
  For the military, the episode is a history of treason that 
began in the negotiations phase before the economic program's 
issuance. The harshest crisis of this episode occurred on 18 
March at Planalto Palace, and the outcome is still unknown. It 
is not merely a salary crisis but, above all, a crisis that has 
uncovered the lack of maturity of the current members of the 
three branches for the full exercise of democracy, and this 
breach provides room for adventures. 
  The military leadership attempted to convince the economic 
leadership to convert its salaries on the basis of the URV [Real 
Value Unit] in force on 15 March. This request was denied after 
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso gave assurances that 
the conversion date for all salaries would be the 30th. In 
giving that answer to the military, Cardoso was leaning on a 
previous agreement with the STF, to which the provisional 
measure enforcing the economic plan was submitted, having been 
encouraged to go ahead. 
  Information that helped break the resistance of the 
military, 
which wanted to move the conversion of their salaries to an 
earlier date, was the compulsory salary equity embedded in the 
economic plan's provisional measure based on the mechanism of 
dates: By setting the 30th as the date for conversion of all 
salaries, the Executive Branch had in practice increased the 
duration of the work month for the two other branches by 10 days 
-- which traditionally pay their salaries on the 20th -- thus 
enforcing salary equity. The Judicial Branch killed that "egg of 
Columbus" the economic team believed it had found. 
  After learning that the STF and Congress made the conversion 
on the 20th, the military felt it should not abide by any 
previous commitment. They pressured President Itamar Franco, in 
the absence of Minister Cardoso, to a forceful position, 
rejecting the claim by STF Chairman Otavio Galotti that he would 
enforce the Constitution. Galotti availed himself of Article 168 
of the Constitution, but this article only sets forth that 
transfer of executive branch funds must be done before the 20th, 
without specifying whether salaries must be paid on that date.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- Navy Minister Ivan Serpa on 22 
March called immoral the salary increase the Judicial and 
Legislative Branches have granted themselves. The minister said: 
"It might be legal but it is not moral." He made these comments 
during the ceremony held to say farewell to the ensigns who left 
on a trip by the "Brasil" school-vessel. He included the 
military among a large number of people who "do not accept a 
society in which a group of people is always favored." He added, 
however, that there will be no rebellion in the barracks. 
  In Serpa's opinion, the government should not give in to 
pressure exerted by Congress and the Federal Supreme Court 
(STF). "If we believe that the Executive Branch must meet all 
requests, there will be no more independence among the powers 
and the Executive Branch will be subdued by the other powers." 
He refused, however, to suggest a solution to the crisis. "I do 
not want to increase the number of rumors," he said. "I want to 
be the fireman and not the arsonist." 
  Minister Serpa made a point of emphasizing that the note 
released by Planalto Palace on 18 March should be interpreted 
"only as criticism" of Congress and the STF. He admitted that 
the military is dissatisfied with low salaries, but asserted 
that the atmosphere in the barracks is "entirely normal." He 
also said he does not agree with the position of the Guararapes 
Group, which comprises retired officers who, in addition to 
requesting that Congress be closed, spoke in favor of holding 
elections before the scheduled date. "I do not agree with them," 
he asserted. "This is not the moment to close anything." He 
supported the group's right to publicly express its members' 
opinions, but asserted that their opinion does not reflect the 
ideas of all retired officers.

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Luisa Azpiazu] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 24 Mar (EFE) -- Antigua and Barbuda's 
decision to break its commitment to Costa Rican Foreign Minister 
Bernd Niehaus in order to vote for Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria in the post of OAS secretary general may trigger a 
"domino effect" and change some voters' intentions. 
  In the view of an expert consulted by EFE News Agency, 
Antigua and Barbuda's decision -- which under other 
circumstances would have passed unnoticed -- is of paramount 
importance now because it is the "first indication that the 
English-speaking Caribbean bloc, which was thought impregnable, 
has collapsed." 
  Antigua and Barbuda is one of the 13 Caricom [Caribbean 
Common Market] members that -- according to what Niehaus has 
said again and again -- had pledged, even in writing, to vote 
for him. 
  Notwithstanding this, Lester Bird, Antigua and Barbuda's 
deputy prime minister, explained that the commitment to vote for 
Niehaus was taken last October, when Gaviria had not yet decided 
to run for the OAS General Secretariat. 
  Therefore, Antigua and Barbuda's decision is based on the 
conviction that "his election will further the interests of the 
OAS in particular and those of the hemisphere's countries in 
general." 
  According to diplomatic sources consulted by EFE, Antigua 
and 
Barbuda's decision "opens the door for a general exodus of 
votes" from the Costa Rican candidate, who, in principle, 
thought he had secured 22 of the 34 votes to be cast on 27 March. 
  Bird believes "Gaviria has the best profile" to meet the 
challenges of the "new OAS." 
  This argument is shared by representatives from several 
countries, some of whom had initially committed themselves to 
voting for Niehaus but are now beginning to wonder about the 
"sense of their vote" given the "specific weight" of Gaviria's 
candidacy. 
  The shift in Antigua and Barbuda's position irrefutably 
proves that Niehaus no longer has the 22 votes he asserted he 
had some days ago. His followers contend nonetheless that 
"there are still three votes more than needed for him to be 
successful in the poll" since only a simple majority is needed, 
i.e. 18 votes. 
  Member countries' delegations also have gotten involved in 
the scramble for the General Secretariat race between Niehaus 
and Gaviria by -- openly or silently -- endorsing one candidate 
or the other. The issue has divided and stirred the OAS to such 
an extent that if each candidate had the votes his followers 
claim, the OAS would have 50 instead of 34 members. 
  With barely three days left for the election to replace 
[incumbent OAS Secretary General] Joao Clemente Baena Soares, 
Niehaus, who champions the right of small countries like his to 
head the OAS, stressed in a news conference that he feels he is 
involved in a "fight between David and Goliath." Nevertheless, 
he said he has 21 votes that will secure his victory. 
  The Colombians and their followers challenge these figures 
and, without expressing figures in their support, guarantee that 
they have enough votes to "be successful" on 27 March. 
  Meanwhile, the OAS has become a place for lobbying and 
betting where lunches and "two-to-one" bets are rampant in an 
effort to discover vote preferences for 27 March. 
  It must not be forgotten, however, that the vote for the OAS 
General Secretariat is "secret," and that anything might happen 
under the cover of anonymity, even forgetting commitments.

  [Text] DPRK Ambassador to Cuba Kim Sung-yong has given a 
news conference in Havana. He referred to the statement issued 
by his government concerning the noncompliance by the United 
States with the New York agreement for a global solution of the 
nuclear issue. 
  The document notes that the U.S. attitude has created a 
serious situation on the Korean peninsula that can take the 
nation to confrontation and war. Taking into account the stand 
of the U.S. Administration, Korean officials have decided 
unilaterally to cease compliance with the provisions concerning 
simultaneous measures; neither will they send a delegation to 
the third round of talks with the United States in Geneva. 
  [Begin Kim Sung-yong recording, in Korean with superimposed 
translation into Spanish] As the statement says, we have 
fulfilled all our obligations included in the agreement signed 
with the United States in New York. But the problem is that the 
United States is not fulfilling its task and is putting much 
pressure on us. Therefore, we are not sending a delegation to 
the third round of talks scheduled for 21 March, and our talks 
with South Korea on the exchange of special envoys have also 
been suspended. [end recording] 
  The DPRK and the United States have agreed to fulfill four 
simultaneous measures, which are: cancellation of the Team 
Spirit-94 joint military maneuvers; resumption of contacts of 
experts for the exchange of special envoys between North and 
South Korea; inspections by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency intended to provide the continuation of the guarantee; 
and, beginning on 21 March, the third round of talks in Geneva.

<F P=106> [Article by Javier Bernales] </F>
  [Text] Havana -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
said his government's new orientation is that "without giving up 
the socialist plan we have chosen, we can trade with a 
capitalist world" because "we have no choice: Either we adjust 
ourselves to that situation and save the essence, or we will 
simply fall in the arms of those who want us to fall, losing the 
victories essential to us." 
  Robaina, 38, has assumed the responsibility of directing and 
developing Cuba's foreign policy, which he has done from an 
offensive position. 
  [Bernales] What is the restructuring of the Cuban foreign 
policy? 
  [Robaina] I would not speak about restructuring, but about 
the need to make a policy in line with the current times. It is 
necessary to take into account factors of the new situation in 
the world, in the area in which we live, and in our country. We 
simply want a foreign policy that reflects the real situation in 
the country, which is very difficult and complex, a policy that 
should not only envisage our problems but also explain our plan 
to the world. 
  [Bernales] What has been your reaction, as head of your 
portfolio, to the designation of a special observer for Cuba by 
the UN Human Rights Council? 
  [Robaina] We have absolutely nothing against the observer, 
but we do reject the mechanism because the designation was made 
on the basis that human rights are flagrantly and massively 
violated in Cuba. For us to accept the observer would mean 
agreeing with this position. 
  [Bernales] Changing the subject, Cuba's foreign trade is 
adjusting itself to the international free market system. Cuba 
has to adjust itself to the foreign capitalist system in order 
to maintain the socialist system on the island. How is this 
apparent contradiction being experienced? 
  [Robaina] It is very complex. For us it is clear that the 
point is to adjust ourselves to an economic model whose name I 
will not try to specify. If I am asked about it, I reply that 
the economic model is Cuban and also feasible. No one asks any 
questions about work in the education, scientific, or health 
areas. There are, however, major questions on a group of 
economic factors that have yielded no results. That is why we 
are trying to join a world in which the rules of the game are 
different from the ones by which we have traditionally directed 
our work. Joining that world, while keeping our own line and 
saving the essential factors, is the process on which we have 
embarked. It is very hard and very difficult, but by being alive 
it has begun to show at least that it exists, and the 100-odd 
entrepreneurs -- or non-entrepreneurs -- or the 100-odd 
businesses that foreign firms have opened in Cuba prove that we 
can trade with the capitalist world without giving up the 
socialist plan that we chose. There are difficulties, but it is 
possible to trade. 
  [Bernales] Please make a brief commentary on the progress in 
Cuban-Chinese relations. 
  [Robaina] There are fine relations with China; there is a 
high level of exchange and communication, which I believe had 
its crowning point with the Chinese president's recent visit to 
Cuba. In addition, China has many important experiences that we 
have to evaluate, without the idea of mechanically copying them 
but with the idea of studying them in order to make progress. 
  [Bernales] In the past four years, relations with Russia and 
with the former Soviet republics had to forcefully change for 
Cuba. How are they now? 
  [Robaina] There is high-level communication with Russia, but 
everyone knows that Russia is experiencing a tremendously 
complex internal process that has nothing to do with the level 
of communications with Cuba. There are more or less normal 
relations with the other former Soviet republics. But both the 
former Soviet republics and the former socialist countries are 
experiencing an internal process that calls for strong 
adjustments in order to define some of their foreign policy 
guidelines. 
  [Bernales] How are diplomatic relations with Chile, taking 
into account that there is no Cuban embassy in that Andean 
country? 
  [Robaina] Relations and communications are in good shape. 
Much noise has been made as to whether we were invited to the 
Chilean inauguration. It is an exclusively Chilean matter; they 
decided to invite a group of people based on concepts and a 
policy that we, like any other country, can respect. We are not 
desperate about our diplomatic relations, and we are not trying 
to accelerate contacts either. Our communications have reached a 
certain level. There is an increasing number of economic links 
that can be established. We should not despair. Everything will 
come in due time. The time will come when both Chileans and 
ourselves will find that conditions are appropriate; there is no 
need to hurry. What I can assure you is that having no 
ambassadorial-level relations is not an obstacle to fluent 
communication.

  [Text] Havana, 21 Mar (DPA) -- An official source reported 
in Havana that Cuba will participate for the first time in the 
regional meeting of Central American and Caribbean foreign 
ministers that will be held in April at San Jose, Costa Rica. 
  A diplomatic spokesman told the DPA that Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina will accept an invitation extended to his 
government to participate in the meeting, in which issues common 
to the area will be discussed. The Third Conference of Central 
American Nations and the Caribbean Common Market (Caricom) will 
discuss the progress achieved in the development of democracy in 
the area and a regional cooperation program. According to the 
source, Cuban Foreign Minister Robaina expressed his interest in 
participating in a forum like the one in San Jose, and he was 
pleased with the invitation extended to Cuba. 
  The conference, originally scheduled for the end of March, 
was postponed by the Costa Rican Foreign Ministry until April, 
at the request of the Caribbean countries, which claimed they 
had problems with their ministers' agendas. 
  Concerning Robaina's possible visit to Spain, the diplomatic 
source said it could occur in May. However, he said the exact 
date must be adjusted by the two countries' foreign ministries. 
The source reported the chief of Cuban diplomacy plans to tour 
Central America during the first half of April, but the details 
and itinerary have yet to be defined.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Havana Cuba Vision Network in Spanish at 
0200 GMT on 24 March carries live its "Open Agenda" program with 
host Antonio Resillez and his guests Ambassador Eumelio 
Caballero, chief of the Foreign Ministry's multilateral 
department, and Ivan Mora, a specialist of the Foreign Ministry. 
  Resillez begins the program by noting that many Cubans 
believe that the only thing discussed by the UN Human Rights 
Commission is the so-called Cuban case. He goes on to point out 
that the Human Rights Commission discusses other things related 
to political and social issues, such as child pornography, 
trafficking of children, etc. 
  In that sense, Caballero says: "I am very happy that this 
has 
been brought up in this program for our viewers -- the work 
carried out by the Human Rights Commission. I myself have 
sometimes had the perception that the Human Rights Commission is 
related to the Cuban case only, when that is only a small part 
of the work that our delegation does in Geneva." 
  In reviewing some of the issues discussed at the Human 
Rights 
Commission, Mora says: "Cuba is not sitting on the stand as a 
defendant regarding Human Rights. When we talk about human 
rights we must talk about human rights violations that are 
taking place around the world." Mora goes on to say: "Small 
countries, like Cuba, are developing different initiatives in 
defense of the interests of the World, the Third World, 
defending the interests of the greater populations of the Third 
World. Cuba has been making headway in this area every year. As 
a matter of fact, Cuba has received the recognition from the 
Third World for the sacrifices that Cuba has to face." 
  Answering Resillez's question on how many propositions and 
resolutions Cuba participated in during the 50th session, Mora 
notes: "Cuba was the delegation that presented the largest 
number of initiatives at the 50th session. They totaled 10, six 
of which were discarded despite the large support by the Third 
World. Some were even adopted by consensus, such as the issue on 
the environment, which is an issue of great concern among many 
countries of the North as well as of the South. Cuba sponsored 
amendments to approximately 20 resolutions, and cosponsored 
another 25 resolutions." 
  Mora goes on to say: "We are talking about space gained by 
Cuba on the international scene, which represents a great deal 
of respect in the international arena." 
  Resillez asks about the vote on the special rapporteur for 
Cuba to which Caballero responds: "Something important happened 
at the session. The fact is that the United States, despite all 
its capacity to apply pressure and being the power that leads 
the unipolar world, lost three votes in favor while the number 
of abstentions rose from 15 to 20. In UN terms, this sends a 
message. This means that this year, the majority of the 
commission of 53 members was not dragged by the United States 
into this vendetta against Cuba. If we add the abstentions, of 
which there were 20, with the votes in favor of Cuba, in this 
case against the resolution, which totaled nine, this means that 
29 countries, more than half, pronounced themselves against it. 
I believe this is significant because the United States reached 
the highest point it could reach on the manipulation of the 
issue against Cuba, and now the retreat has begun. That is the 
best reading or analysis." 
  Resillez asks about reaction from other delegations to the 
secret U.S. Interest Section document. On this topic, Mora 
responds: "I believe this document favored the vote. In other 
words, it was an element that supported something we had been 
saying for several years, which is also recognized by the great 
majority of the members of the United Nations. The document 
caused a great deal of bewilderment among the U.S. delegation. 
It was a scandal where they had been caught red-handed in their 
action of condemning alleged human rights violations in Cuba, 
when it was demonstrated through the document that it was all a 
great lie." 
  In that sense, Mora goes on to say that the document was 
important because it characterized those people and groups in 
the United States who are interested in subordinating the 
revolution to the will of the empire. 
  Regarding the special rapporteur Caballero says: "The Cuban 
people should not feel complexes or be worried about the fact 
that there is a special rapporteur or that the Cuban case is on 
the agenda of the Human Rights Commission." He goes on to say: 
"The international community, including countries allied with 
the United States, understand that in Cuba there is no 
systematic violation or problem with human rights. That is well 
understood by the international community. Sometimes -- Ivan has 
seen this -- after voting against us many of these delegates 
approach us to excuse themselves and to say that they are sorry 
that they voted that way, but that they had been forced to do 
so. In other words, there is an understanding on the 
international arena that we do not have this type of problem in 
Cuba." 
  Caballero adds: "The most important thing is that just a few 
days ago, in New York, the Latin American group endorsed Cuba's 
reelection to the Human Rights Commission." 
  Answering Resillez's question on the group of Nobel Prize 
Winners who will visit Cuba, Mora remarks: "The Foreign Ministry 
is studying the composition of the group that will visit us. We 
reject the imposition of the special rapporteur since it was 
done violating all the procedures established by the United 
Nations, but at the same time we have absolutely nothing to 
hide. That is why we want international personalities, Nobel 
Prize winners, to see what our actual situation is. It will be a 
good opportunity for them to see the effects of the U.S. 
blockade against Cuba."

  [Text] As in the rest of Cuba, the Parliaments in the 
Workplace have concluded in Matanzas Province. Each of the 
proposals and suggestions made by the workers during the 
sessions of the Parliaments in the Workplace will be taken into 
account and will receive an appropriate reply by the union 
leaders of the various sectors involved in the meetings. 
  This was confirmed by Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of 
the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC], during his address in the 
meeting closing the process in Matanzas. Yadira Garcia, 
Politburo member and first secretary of the Communist Party of 
Cuba in Matanzas, also chaired the meeting. 
  Ross announced that on 29 March the CTC National Committee 
will meet officially to close the nationwide process. Topics 
such as profitability, economic efficiency, subsidies, and 
possible measures to prevent excess currency were issues 
discussed by the 205,000 workers in the province who 
participated in the base meetings, where more than 9,400 
interventions were recorded. Both figures represent a record for 
union meetings in this providence. 
  Ross added that Cuba is looking for a consensus on, 
understanding of, and comprehension of a package of possible 
measures to be implemented, some of which are controversial such 
as the change of currency, an issue on which there are many 
opinions. There are other measures being endorsed by most of the 
population, such as the confiscation of ill-gotten money.

  [Excerpts] Yesterday, Cienfuegos Province held its plenum 
to summarize the workers parliament process in that province, 
where it was stated that more than 100,000 workers participated 
in the more than 2,700 workers parliaments held at different 
work centers in Cienfuegos Province. Economic efficiency was 
recognized as the essential road to Cuba's recovery. 
Furthermore, the importance of solving the problems through 
common effort and intelligence and through honoring the 
principles of the revolution, was stressed. 
  Several presentations were made during the meeting on what 
has been accomplished through the implementation of ideas 
brought forth by workers. These demonstrate the point that we 
must begin by becoming efficient in our own lives. [passage 
omitted] 
  Pedro Ross, secretary general of the Cuban Workers 
Federation [CTC], recognized that Cienfuegos has been very 
responsive to the ideas presented in the parliaments and stated 
that we do not have to freeze those ideas since new ideas could 
arise which could be more fitting to our actual situation. Ross 
went on to say that all possibilities have not been considered. 
He congratulated Cienfuegos for its dynamism in responding to 
the workers. 
  In his remarks at the plenum summarizing the workers 
parliaments in Cienfuegos, Ross said that all the officials that 
attended the parliaments should keep in touch and follow up on 
those collectives, since we are just beginning the phase of 
shaping those ideas presented. Pedro Ross stated that all 
problems cannot be solved overnight, but that we must be active 
and bold, as is the case in Cienfuegos, through the 
implementation of ideas presented at the different workers 
parliaments throughout the province.

  [Text] Havana, 22 Mar (EFE) -- Cuba is prepared "to wage 
victoriously, if necessary, a peoples war," according to a final 
analysis of the Cuban Army's activities during 1993, published 
today by the official newspaper GRANMA. 
  The "strengthening of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] 
capability and combat readiness" is the principal conclusion 
reached by the Military Council Session of the Defense Ministry, 
which was presided over by Defense Minister Raul Castro, the 
second in the island's political hierarchy. 
  The effort and initiative displayed despite the special 
period's limitations "have allowed the country to be in a 
position to victoriously wage, if necessary, a peoples war," the 
official report emphasized. 
  Referring to the economic issues, the 50 percent reduction 
in 
the military budget is important proof of the FAR members' will 
to make the FAR cost the nation as little as possible, which 
would also help reduce the national budget deficit, it was added 
in the note prominently displayed by the Cuban communist 
newspaper. 
  The article also emphasizes that "the important results 
achieved in all areas of military activities would not have been 
possible without proper discipline and the troops' high 
political and moral condition." 
  Moreover, the newspaper reports Enrique Carrera was promoted 
to the rank of division general on his 50th anniversary as a 
combat pilot. It says that, "to everyone's satisfaction, he is 
one of those generals who will die with their boots on," and he 
is still an active member of the FAR at the age of 71. 
  During the promotion ceremony, General Ulises Rosales de 
Toro, chief of the Armed Forces Supreme Command, said Carrera 
"became a master of the air, and he modeled and forged character 
and ethics standards that represent an example of human virtue, 
trustworthy military honor at the service of his people, 
patriotism, and revolutionary and communist spirit." 
  Gen. Enrique Carrera is one of the pilots who participated 
in 
air combat during the 1961 Bay of Pigs (Playa Giron) invasion.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Argentina monitored through 24 
March. 
  The World Bank has agreed to grant Argentina a $508.5 
million 
loan that will be used to promote market capital. It also 
approved a $100 million credit for the health sector. (Buenos 
Aires CLARIN in Spanish 15 Mar 94 p 20) 
  The National Institute of Statistics and Census reported 
that 
the Argentine trade balance registered a $3.6956 billion deficit 
in 1993 with exports at $13.090 billion and imports at $16.786 
billion. It was $1.0588 billion more than in 1992, when the 
deficit was $2.6368 billion. Argentina's main purchasers are 
Brazil with $2.790 billion, the United States with $1.273 
billion, and the Low Countries with $1.270 billion, which 
represents 41 percent of 1993's exports. (Buenos Aires NOTICIAS 
ARGENTINAS in Spanish 2327 GMT 17 Mar 94)

  [Text] The leaders of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party], PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], PFL [Liberal 
Front Party], PL [Liberal Party], PP [Popular Party], and PPB 
[Brazilian People's Party] promised President Itamar Franco that 
they would not attend the congressional session today to vote on 
the provisional measure that converts salaries into URV's [Real 
Value Units]. 
  According to Senator Jose Richa, the idea is to wait and 
allow the government to reedit on 29 March the provisional 
measure with changes clarifying the date for salary conversions 
into URV. This will thus put a final end to the political 
crisis among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

<F P=106> [Report by Beth Veloso from Congress] </F>
  [Text] The government has been granted more time to 
negotiate changes made by Congress on the provisional measure 
that creates the Real Value Unit, URV. 
  Congress postponed voting on the bill for changes in the 
provisional measure that created the URV. The parties that 
support the government did not want to vote on the issue and 
create obstacles by extending their debates. Government leader 
in the Senate Pedro Simon said the modifications suggested to 
the provisional measure would ruin the government's 
stabilization plan by increasing salaries and granting a minimum 
wage increase. He asked Congress not to make the mistake of 
voting emotionally. Deputy Tarcisio Delgado, leader of the 
Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, PMDB, opposed the point of 
view of Deputy Gonzaga Mota, who is also a PMDB member, and said 
the measures contemplated in the plan are unrealistic lies. 
  At 1400, Senate President Humberto Lucena closed the session 
to begin the Constituent Congress debates. Workers Party, PT, 
Deputy Chico Vigilante would not agree to the decision and 
called Lucena a hanger-on. Lucena now will sue Vigilante for 
lack of decorum. 
  Another congressman who also can be punished is Deputy Jose 
Chicote, also a PT member, who hit Deputy Luiz Carlos Hauly 
because he was trying to postpone voting on the bill. 
  Civilian Household Head Henrique Hargreaves came to Congress 
and said that by postponing the vote, the government and members 
of Congress will have more time to discuss the loss of salaries' 
purchasing power and the amount of the minimum wage.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Another Effort"] </F>
  [Text] The people were doubly insulted by the deputies's 
inopportune decision to hike their own salaries and by the fact 
that the legislative and judicial branches have found a way to 
make money when converting their salaries into URV's [Real Value 
Unit]. 
  They now find that, under the same impetus, Congress has 
rejected the salary equity draft bill for public servants by 
rejecting the president of the Republic's veto on the article 
that provides for exorbitant salaries for public servants. 
  Federal Administration Minister Romildo Canhim has many 
reasons to be disgusted about this: it has now become almost 
impossible to administer public servants without stirring up a 
storm among them. The problem now is not only that salaries are 
not equitable but that the "maharajas" [public servants who 
enjoy privileges] have become an institution. 
  This disappointment also affects the common Brazilian 
citizen 
who cannot understand such a lack of sensibility regarding 
common wellbeing. 
  The foundation of a state of law is ethical, not juridical, 
nor formal -- because it is based on the principle that we are 
all equal before the law -- but the developments of this past 
week seem to suggest the opposite: The law is more generous to 
those who draft it. 
  This frightening and contradictory peculiarity also appears 
to be preventing the continuation of the constitutional reform, 
which thus hinders the approval of lasting solutions to the 
serious problems affecting the country. 
  For instance, when Congress debates whether or not to 
maintain the compulsory vote, one can only see the intention not 
to change, by any means, the legislators' life -- because the 
compulsory vote is an important component in the mechanisms that 
move the old electoral windmills: which are fueled by money and 
inertia. 
  Group interests is an evil that can surface in any society: 
consolidated interests exist everywhere and they are always 
looking for ways to perpetuate themselves. 
  But the problem becomes tragic when, in a country like 
Brazil, group interests become established precisely on the road 
of basic changes for the entire society, especially affecting 
the most needy, the most hard up sectors due to retrograde 
structures. 
  In view of the discouragement created by recent voting 
sessions, those who favored postponing the constitutional reform 
will side with those who are against it -- this latter group 
includes those who uphold their own interests and those who 
uphold ideologies. 
  To postpone the reform would be illogical as well as a 
defeat 
in the legislative field because the creation of the Social 
Emergency Fund was only juridically possible because a date for 
concluding the congressional reform had been set. Time is 
running out and it is hoped that responsible sectors of Congress 
will make a collective effort for the sake of the most 
elementary sense of duty to use the time left well. 
  The worst that can happen is that this effort will only 
serve 
to show the electors who is worthy of their vote.

  [Text] Brasilia, 24 Mar (EFE) -- Official sources reported 
that Brazilian President Itamar Franco today expressed his 
condolences to his Mexican counterpart, Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari, for the death of Mexican presidential candidate Luis 
Donaldo Colosio. 
  In a fax addressed to Salinas de Gortari, Franco repudiated 
"the absurd and shocking violence" that cost Colosio's life 
while he was presiding over a meeting of his campaign for 
Mexico's presidency for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary 
Party. 
  The Brazilian president hoped Mexico can continue its effort 
to consolidate its economic and social development with the 
support of the democratic institutions.

<F P=106> [From the "Notes and Information" page: "A Five-Hour Visit"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Vice President Al Gore's clout among the 
constellation of American politicians is by no means unknown to 
the Brazilian Government. Precisely for this reason -- even 
though we performed all the protocol formalities -- one cannot 
fail to note that his stay in Brasilia was not consistent with 
Brazil's importance in the hemisphere. The five hours that Gore 
allocated to the last leg of his tour were enough to meet the 
ends established for his trip, namely, to sign a new science and 
technology cooperation treaty, to hold talks with President 
Itamar Franco on the summit of the Americas (to be held in 
December), and to say some things to the U.S. and Brazilian 
communities. It was a working stopover, and as such, served its 
purpose. From the wider viewpoint under which relations between 
Brazil and the United States should be analyzed, this five-hour 
stopover was enough to clearly spell out the place Brazil 
occupies on the Clinton Administration's list of political 
priorities: For the White House, Argentina and Chile take 
precedence over Brazil. 
  The brevity of his stay prevented Gore from explaining to 
President Franco the objectives of President Clinton's Latin 
American policy. Undoubtedly, the hemispheric summit -- at 
which the heads of state and government of the Americas will 
discuss common economic and political problems -- is one of 
these objectives, and it was discussed with the Brazilian head 
of state. 
  The Clinton administration bases its Latin American policy 
on 
what is known at the U.S. Department of State as substantive 
symmetry [preceding words in English]. This expression -- with 
a geometrical flavor -- means, for example, that the United 
States is seeking to recover a sense of belonging to society and 
the community while Latin America is pursuing reconciliation 
between democracy and politics; that the United States is 
reforming its health care, education, and security systems while 
Latin America is beginning to turn to the "social agenda." It 
is from this substantive symmetry that the United States is 
trying to establish a new relationship with Latin America. One 
should not forget that this new approach includes problems that 
have yet to be overcome, such as the fight against drug 
trafficking -- which Washington deems a matter of national 
security -- and the new role of the Armed Forces. 
  Al Gore pays more attention to environmental and 
technological questions. Even though he did not directly raise 
the issue of telecommunications, he must have surely left a 
message -- at a time when the leading U.S. companies are 
devising schemes for a worldwide telephone network, it is 
unthinkable that Brazil should continue to maintain a whimsical 
monopoly; but this fact merely prevents Brazil from really 
entering the high-speed high-tech era.

  [Text] The PDT [Democratic Labor Party] and the PMDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] are negotiating a broad 
front for the upcoming presidential elections. PDT Deputy 
Vivaldo Barbosa said the two parties are concerned about the 
polarization of the candidacies of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva 
from the PT [Workers Party] and Fernando Henrique Cardoso from 
the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. Barbosa said the 
PDT and the PMDB want to present a new alternative through a 
center-left candidate. 
  One month ago, Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola, from 
the PDT, promised PMDB President Luiz Henrique that he will not 
oppose the creation of a progressive broad front. 
  Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho said that after 
consulting the grassroots, the general wish is to support the 
candidacy of Orestes Quercia as the presidential candidate. 
Fleury revealed that he will campaign for Quercia in all states. 
  The official announcement will be made on 24 March at the 
Sao 
Paulo Government House during a ceremony in which Quercia and 
other Sao Paulo State mayors will be present.

  [Text] Commenting on the problems of Chilean fruit exports 
to Argentina, Argentine Ambassador to Chile Eduardo Iglesias 
said that the difficulties do not seem to be very serious, as 
had been reported over the past 48 hours. Iglesias met with 
Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia to discuss the matter. 
  [Begin Iglesias recording] An established mechanism was 
implemented, but it seems that the delay caused some problems, 
as the fruit could have spoiled. But there were no serious 
problems at all, nor any violations of the mechanisms of the 
economic supplementation agreement. [end recording] 
  Iglesias could not determine the specific problem, as there 
was no technical explanation. 
  He was told that labels written in English had been the 
origin of the problem, and that Argentine officials rejected 
them as they must all be written in Spanish. 
  [Begin Iglesias recording] Yes, this issue was discussed. 
The economic supplementation agreement provides norms for 
quality, quantity, and containers. But the quality of the fruit 
was not mentioned at all. [end recording] 
  When asked if he could assure that this problem would not 
jeopardize the economic supplementation agreement, he said: 
  [Begin Iglesias recording] On the contrary, it is working 
better than ever, and there is no major problem that could 
prevent it from being implemented. I think this mechanism shows 
that problems are solved within 48 hours, as has happened with 
other cases. Argentina is also concerned about the possible 
dumping of flour, a situation that is regarded as incorrect. It 
seems that some sectors are claiming that Argentina is 
distorting the economic supplementation agreement mechanism. I 
have asked Buenos Aires for more information. I do not think 
this position is correct. [end recording] 
  Iglesias concluded by saying that this case of trucks loaded 
with fruit had been resolved, but that they would be on constant 
alert about the situation. 
  Chilean Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia, in turn, told the 
Argentine ambassador that the problems that fruit exporters were 
experiencing in Argentina could lead to possible actions that 
could hamper bilateral commercial development. 
  Garcia met with Iglesias, with whom he discussed other major 
issues. 
  [Begin Garcia recording] We also analyzed the need to review 
the economic supplementation agreement agreed upon by Chile and 
Argentina taking into account the Common Market of the South, 
Mercosur, agreements. This year all Mercosur member countries 
will have to maintain equal treatment of third countries, and 
this obviously could lead to changes in the bilateral agreements 
with Argentina. We have already agreed to begin talks so as to 
avoid surprises that the changes in reciprocities demanded by 
Mercosur could imply for our bilateral agreement. [end 
recording] 
  As for the specific problems, Garcia said that Iglesias 
suggested that the quality standards required of Chilean 
exporters do not imply any discrimination, as these must also be 
observed by local producers and other foreign partners. 
Concerning the trucks loaded with fruit, Garcia told Iglesias 
that the problem was caused by the shortage of employees in 
Chilean customs, which compelled exporters to take their 
products to other zones. This entailed a delay of three days, 
which for economic reasons they could not tolerate. Garcia noted 
the need to prevent mutually harmful actions. 
  [Begin Garcia recording] This hampers the full development 
of 
the trade agreement. Iglesias completely agreed that we had to 
avoid at any cost this type of situation, and act in keeping 
with our common decision. [end recording] 
  Garcia concluded by saying that Iglesias was not fully aware 
of the incident, and promised to soon try to determine the 
causes.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Chile monitored through 24 
March. 
  The Swedish Government on 10 March donated $5 million to 
Bolivia. This money will be used to pay a debt to the World 
Bank. The agreement was signed by Bolivian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Aranibar and Swedish Ambassador to Bolivia Lars 
Schonander at the Foreign Ministry. (La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 
11 Mar 94 p 1) 
  The World Bank will grant $94 million to Bolivia in June. Of 
this, $50 million will be designed for the general budget and to 
help the government face transition costs. The remainder will be 
earmarked for the hydrocarbons industry, the Bolivian Government 
Oil Deposits privatization project, and for technical assistance 
to the National Electricity Enterprise. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in 
Spanish 11 Mar 94 National Page p 1) 
  Pension fund administration boards' profits were $2.4616 
billion in 1993, a drop of 46 percent compared with 1992. Last 
year, six of the 13 boards had losses, compared with two in 
1992. Santiago Inc. registered the highest deficit with $218.6 
million. (Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 10 Mar 94 p 16) 
  The Central Bank of Chile termed 1993's economic results 
satisfactory. Economic growth was 6 percent last year. 
Construction, commerce, and transportation were the most dynamic 
sectors. Investment hit a record 27 percent. Production in 1993 
totaled $43.6 billion. (Santiago Television Nacional de Chile
